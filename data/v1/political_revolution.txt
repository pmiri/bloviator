It doesn't but thanks for playing.
My interest is politics what do you expect? \n\nSeriously though, TISA is not TPP and it's our loss due to sheer stupidity. 
I will not vote for an anti-Semite. 
This all sounds good, and this is not a hostile question, but rather a genuine one.\n\nHow will any of this spending affect a vote by a select group of democrats who get to decide the next party chair?  The reason I ask is that this is not a national vote and I would think the people voting are rather 'insiders' who would be less susceptible to things like targeted advertising.  
NOW WE HAVE TISA COMING WHICH INCLUDES TPP
Always good to hear from the Eeyore brigade. It's spectators like you whose pessimistic moaning creates self-fulfilling prophecies of defeat. If you don't want to contribute, fine. Just take your bad attitude and go hug a Republican or something. 
I got banned from that place for criticizing the application (though not the spirit) of their anti-ableism policy. I generally hang around the 101 subs, /r/FULLDISCOURSE, and /r/DebateCommunism. I occasionally come here and to /r/SandersForPresident and a few other places to inject some class consciousness and share some general anti-capitalist Leftist critiques people may not be familiar with. \n\nThough I'm not Christian, or even religious, /r/RadicalChristianity is a pretty cool place, if a little empty. 
You think that, but if Bernie or Tulsi spearheaded the party, it could be viable for 2020
Go for it, but realistically it'll take a couple decades before a new party has a shot at a viable presidential candidate. In the meantime it's also worth trying to fix the DNC. If Trump and the Tea Party idiots can take over from the GOP establishment, then surely the DNC establishment isn't invulnerable either.
What is this money going toward? Do Democrats need war chests to run for internal, party offices now? Weird. 
Sam Ronan or bust.
I thought we all left after the primary?
Good old compromise, the guy with the 'best chance to win'.  I think that may be part of why we've gotten this far into trouble already.  
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Keep crying that it hasn't been done, and then keep trying to revive a dead donkey. 
>I got banned from that place for criticizing the application (though not the spirit) of their anti-ableism policy \n\nWhat a coincidence, same here! \n\nAlthough technically I got banned for telling the mods to go fuck themselves, it was after the 3rd or 4th time i complained about their stupid fucking censorship bot only to be met with holier-than-thou "Wow you really want to disparage the differently abled" when I clearly take issue with unelected, unaccountable mods banning words from the English language at their discretion with no democratic input from the community whatsoever. They want to ban hate speech, but they're just banning speech like it's remotely the same thing. 
Half of your donation through this link goes to TPR. The other half to Ellison. We use what we receive to simply cover expenses related to organizing around progressive issues. This isn't just about getting people elected. TPR only takes small dollar donations from individuals. Like you. No corporate money, which corrupts. 
Cant fault her. Rational people hate dc
Radicalchristianity is great.  Love that place.  
I personally think the change needs to start at the local levels of government... city councils, town mayors, heck, even local school board members. If a new party... say the justice democrats, or maybe a reinvigorated Green Party becomes relevant, I would be very happy, but I will be surprised. \n\nAnd I am somewhat ashamed that I end up supporting a party in bed with Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the military industrial complex.. it leads to a cognitive dissonance, and I definitely recognize that. 
Thanks for posting this, as I didn't know any of the arguments against Perez
pro TPP
Care to talk a little bit about him?  I've not heard the name before.
Where do you get off accusing anybody with a degree in finance as fake news? In fact, everybody who isn't a green party voter speaks favorably of the TPP. \n\nRegardless of the TPP, nearly every country *already voluntarily agrees to investor-state arbitration*. It's a necessary tool of international law that protects foreign direct investment. **So your rejection of any reforms as inadequate merely perpetuates the existing system.** \n\nThat's probably why Barack Obama insisted on 'that sentence' and a few others. That in itself is enough for states to latch onto. Also we're talking about lawyers so of course everything needs to be said. More propaganda on your part. \n\nLastly, you completely confused force with influence. Military bases are a projection of force or hard power. International trade and foreign development, and building up a country's economy is a peaceful method of influence or soft power. \n\nThe TPP was a union of 12 countries mostly bordering China, specifically those in China's shadow. But hey, let's fuck all of up to protect a few sweat shop jobs in America. Good one.
a big part of the chair is showing good fundraising ability, so throwing our financial support behind ellison will in effect show the dnc they are getting our grassroots support as well.
>I think a simple bot explaining the purpose of the policy and some of the arguments behind it with links to external sources to learn more would be better, and then rely on the community to report more egregious examples of "anti-ableist" speech. Maybe even provide a link to a list of activist organizations for disabled people to aid bridging alliances across organizations.\n\nExactly, my issue with it is that they're banning speech rather than the act of engaging in hate speech. I shouldn't have a huge post completely and instantly removed with no recourse or oversight simply for having the word nuts in it anywhere (i.e. "I had nuts for a snack"), for example. The way it is now is completely ridiculous, but the mods don't seem to care how many people feel the same way. 
There's literally zero reason to believe this. Bernie carries a lot of popularity, Tulsi has far less. Even together, they make up only a small minority of the left, which is a much smaller minority of the country. No third party has ever revolutionized overnight.
Perez already has the votes. Why would I give $27 that will not change anything about the party or who leads it?\n\nThe DNC is dead. The Perez win will be the final nail.
Not giving shit to any dem until I see if they have figured out the problem. This vote will decide that.\n\nPersonally, I highly doubt I will have to give to the Dem party again, and I am fine with that.
[The DNC will not listen to](http://i.imgur.com/k2kzELD.png) [progressives they only care about](http://i.imgur.com/jlICXPA.jpg) [their money & profits and celebrity endorsements    ](http://i.imgur.com/6mLINij.jpg)
Is Perez not a progressive? I'm confused. What stances of his aren't progressive?
Has Ellison ever talked about the election fraud?\n\nI'd donate if it was for Sam Ronan. 
As if. Westworld is a game on a shelf in Caprica's media room.
Yes TISA INCLUDES MAJOR COMPONENTS OF TPP.
Any polls on this? This is the pompeo replacement? Its likely a highly republican district.
There's nothing wrong with the TPP.
I gave my $27 dollars last year to Bernie. If money is what it takes this year to get "our" person in, I want no part of it. Money is what destroyed the Democratic Party, more money than we could realistically hope to raise. Either we win on ideas or lose to the corporate money interests and start anew.
His support for TPP is enough for me. Not to mention he told Clinton's camp during the primary that they should paint Bernie as the candidate for whites so it would turn off minorities: http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/10/11/labor-secretary-advised-clinton-cast-sanders-candidate-whites-turn-minorities  What a true piece of shit Tom Perez is, I say this as a minority.
Not the same countries so totally different.
That's actually not accurate. The TPP reforms existing trade arbitration architecture for the better. \n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d7379996-862b-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896\n\nThis isolationist crap is really hurting American influence.\n\nEdit: All negotiations are secret. The Iran Deal was secret. Why do you spout propaganda regardless of context?
I mentioned somewhere else that it seemed the application of the policy (again, not the spirit) seemed rather liberal in that it was more about making people *feel* better than actually aiming to be in solidarity with our disabled brothers and sisters. \n\nI think a simple bot explaining the purpose of the policy and some of the arguments behind it with links to external sources to learn more would be better, and then rely on the community to report more egregious examples of "anti-ableist" speech. Maybe even provide a link to a list of activist organizations for disabled people to aid bridging alliances across organizations. 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nDONATE TO CROWD PAC THAT WILL ONLY CHARGE IF KEITH IS ELECTED!
Unfortunately money is necessary to beat the corporate money interests in order to take the advantage that they currently have away.\n\nIt's not an even playing field between money and ideas right now. 
Forgot about him. Yeah realistically it seems like Keith has the best shot of the candidates who would be the most progressive-friendly. But I hope Ronan and Buttigieg are somehow still in the picture if/when Keith wins.
Hey, same here, comrade! \n\nAdding a plug for /r/LateStageCapitalism because I've been finding myself there more and more after the election and you may enjoy the memes as well.
Where do we head though? Is it possible to start a third party?
Fuck the Democratic Party. Start a workers party that under cuts both the DNC and RNC and focuss on independent voters.
I agree, not an even playing field and if money is the answer, I hope this does well. If it comes down to a battle of money, we cannot hope to match the corporate war chest, that is my point. Progressives are a minority of the party and will be outspent.  We have the better ideas and the enthusiasm, that is our best weapon. 
Get your comparison. Don't think it applies here.
Oh please. How about people can be evil? I assure you -- have you met my ex-husband? -- that men can be plenty evil, too.
Honestly this alone should disqualify him. Why would we choose someone to be chair who has already fostered unnecessary racial animosity within his own party for cynical political gain? 
Your first fuck up was sending me a link from a financial news outlet and what a shock, it speaks favorably of TPP. You were probably hoping that sending me this link would scare me off. But I read it and this is probably one of the weakest rebuttals I have received on reddit. First of all, the article doesn't even go into any detail, it pretty much talked in platitudes about the TPP, with stuff like "its gonna bring more transparency" "and "it'll close loop holes". There is a sentence in the article that says "The TPP includes language affirming governments’ right to regulate 'in the public interest'". What is the point of putting that sentence in the TPP, when that should go without even saying it? That's just a statement, not a binding rule like the "host country's regulation will trump all lawsuits brought forth." It just says "Countries have the right to regulate.", that has no teeth behind it.  That's section is there so the supporters of TPP like you, can point to that section and say "Look, what's being said is not true." You probably were hoping I wouldn't see this sentence from the very article you sent me: "Mr. Froman, said he was wary of creating an appeals system in a transatlantic deal as it could end up simply giving investors more opportunities to challenge governments." He said they have only had like 17 cases brought up in 30 years, but if TPP passed that number would have exploded because the deal creates an appeals court so corporations can appeal over and over again. Not to mention if the corporation wins, the government has to pay them for the lost profits they are suing for and all their legal fees. Oh yeah, what about the part where drug companies can hold on to patents, pretty much shutting out generic drugs, keeping drug prices high and financially inaccessible to people with low incomes, so companies can reap more profits. Yeah, keep arguing in favor of these corporations, thinking they are your friends. The TPP hardly had anything to do with trade and was largely about giving even more powers and entitlements to corporations. "This isolationist crap is really hurting American influence." We have over 800 military bases around the world, the strongest military(and most costly) the planet has ever seen, we are the richest country in human existence. How much more "influence" do we really need? We actually could do with less "influence", then we'd probably geo-politically, start being less of a dickhead to the rest of the world. And if you're talking about "influence" in terms of our corporations, their conduct domestically and globally, has been even worse. "...hurting American influence." And you have the nerve to accuse me of spouting propaganda. Smh.
Keith seems legit. I got his back :)

Ellison has raised more money than Perez.
That's a different argument.

Oh yes there is, let me count the ways. Well, I'll only need one argument: The Investor-State arbitration part where corporations can sue the host countries for laws they say are cutting into their profits. For example, it's more profitable for a corporation to dump it's waste into a lake, river or ocean, bury it in the ground, than to properly and safely depose of their waste, they can sue the government for that because properly deposing and storing their waste cost them more, cuts into their profits. And they'll win because the corporations get to hire the judges who rule in those tribunals, I wonder who those judges will side with? Apply that to any labor laws, environmental laws, and economic laws that protect the citizens of the host country and that cost corporations, when it would be cheaper for the corporations to skirt those laws. Seeing how corporations have had an attitude of profits over people and the environment, I'm not willing to take that chance. This provision alone alarmed a lot of people, it's not a shock that governments and corporations negotiated the TPP in total secrecy, and wouldn't reveal any details until it was signed and too late to stop.
you just argue with everyone throughout your entire history.
Frankly it doesn't matter who wins, one man isn't gonna fix anything.  What's the point of Ellison leading the party when people don't show up to vote like they did in the primaries?  And if Perez leads the party wouldn't he be forced to play ball if all his state party associates were replaced by progressives?  We can all be former Democrats together while Republicans stay Republican letting Trump destroy everything.  I mean we already made huge inroads in California, Michigan and North Carolina, why not push for a takeover?  I mean we made huge inroads with bernie sanders with the original infrastructure
How dare you ask such an insane question?! DOWNVOTED! -Reddit
I'll answer this way, rather than trying to lay it out in my own words. He may "claim" progressive, but he is just another Clinton Crony. Sanders supporters know this, and that is why they want Ellison.\n\nAgain, Ellison wins, party splits. \n\nSo, let's begin.\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/tom-perez-endorses-hillary-clinton-216381\n\nThis one.\nhttp://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/10/11/labor-secretary-advised-clinton-cast-sanders-candidate-whites-turn-minorities\n\nHow about this one.\nhttp://freebeacon.com/politics/perez-used-government-account-coordinate-clinton-campaign/\n\nThis one:\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/tom-perez-last-liberal-standing-clinton-s-vp-shortlist-n614051
Money money money. I got no more money for politicians. Ask me for something else, anything else. Stop asking for my money. Get the wallet out of politics, while you're at it.
I went full-blown socialist and fully condemn both parties as mere political manifestations of concentrated private tyranny. 
Yeah, no. The DNC still has not learned what the problem was: CLINTON AND HER CRONIES.\n\nIf Perez wins, which is VERY likely, then I and many other folks will be FORMER democrats. \n\nIt's that simple. The party has failed for 30 years, and keeping Clinton cronies in there, like Perez, is just going to be the nail in the coffin.\n\nWould I give $27 today? NOPE. Perez has 180 out of 224 votes. Hmm, sounds like they STILL are not listening, having learned nothing. \n\nRevolution is nice and all, but why are you asking people to donate to a lost cause? Perez has this, far and away more than anyone else. This would be a complete waste of $27.
Sad but true 
Nope, but it matters to other democrats who we need to vote for him.
Search for him on YouTube, especially his interviews on the Jimmy Dore Show.  I'd give you links but I'm on mobile.
This is not cool.... not cool man. NOT COOL.
EXACTLY ! This is what I thought I would hear a conservative say... and my bleeding liberal heart respects you for it. 
This asshole is a great example of someone engaged in voter fraud... for some reason, it's not of any interest to the republicans... I guess he's not defrauding the "right kind of people" so it's cool
I totally have...but I cant stand the thought of him gloating because he got Mitch fired. \n
This confuses me...
Going through the legs was his speciality....
More parallels to come ... oh god no
Honestly, I do not believe the party of Trump is conservative in either sense of the word. I mean.... not to keep bringing up pussygate, but that should have been enough to discredit him amongst all social conservatives. \n\nHe definitely owed the evangelicals on the hill for his victories in the south. Hence, you get Pruitt, Sessions etc.
It's ok to not be a "firm believer" in his talent... I'm definitely not on that train. Can he do some things well... sure... but that bully ball style of play is great in college, it just isn't sufficient in the NBA. 
Definitely see the point of view Cruz is coming from a little better now 
Hey.... thanks! I guess I'll give that a shot.
He's also in the top 30 power forwards in real plus minus... for comparison, Randle was somewhere in the 60s last I checked. 
Hey... I'm sorry to hear that you've been booted from r/politics. I'm not "bitching" about the r/conservative sub... they have the right to kick me out. But I feel like they are doing a disservice to their own cause by kicking off someone open to their ideology. 
I think a lot of people watch him for that reason. The trouble is, he can influence public opinion. And that's what makes it possible for owners to make big changes. \n\nHe was vocal before the hiring and firing of every one of our coaches. He has been talking smack about this FO despite having no constructive suggestions whatsoever. It's so annoying that he gets millions of dollars to do this garbage. The whole episode with KD was another shocker...
There was also a lot o love for exum. I do think smart is an excellent player ... albeit a bit of a liability on offense. 
His soul !! 
"Naaah... that was just some 4D chess by the god emperor. He's going to lull Clinton into complacency and then ... boom! Do you not know how trump operates?" -- every comment on r/the_donald
Tarik is my favorite current laker... he always gives it a 100%, he's a team player, and seems to be an overall great guy. 
I can see your point of view, I just feel somewhat different. I understand my stance might be somewhat idealistic. \n\nBut honestly, if you do a post mortem for this election , the election was lost by the Democratic Party more than it was won by the republicans. The party did turn its back on its base by putting corporate interests above those of unions and workers. It's what the nephew liberal movement stands for. On top of that, you had a candidate who was claiming to be a populist while delivering speeches to Goldman bankers admiting her public and private opinions are different and calling trump supporters deplorable. The only thing that kept this race close was how terrible of s candidate Donald trump was. \n\nI'm probably ranting. I don't want to put you down, but I just feel like the burden of proof should lie with the leaders. They need to earn my support. 
Minotaurs, right? The mythological creature that lives in the maze. Only usually there's just one.
Gun laws... I used to believe that there ought to be no guns at all, but sane right wingers made me realize that will not happen and need not happen. \n\nI'm also conflicted about a specific issue about LGBT rights... with the furore about the lady who refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding. I thought that was ludicrous at first, but someone asked me "are you not asking them to compromise on their religious beliefs by asking them to bake a cake for a gay wedding". I see some trouble there... like what if someone's religion tells them not to serve black people food, or something stupid like that. But it made me question my stance. \n\nAlso, I can listen to folks like Ron Paul and see a lot of logic in their stance, because it emphasizes a non-interventionalist foreign policy.\n\nOther issues : I used to be more of a leftie, but I recognize that capitalism is the smarter system in many respects... however, I still believe that what we practice is a form of risk-free capitalism for the rich. If you are truly a capitalistic society, you should not be bailing banks out. \n\nPolitical correctness: My right wing friends believe that they get shut out of conversation when they are at the workplace, which is a highly liberal environment. They feel alienated, and judged for airing right wing opinions. I can see why they would feel this way, and I sympathize somewhat. 
Feel better... no, not really.\n\nBut maybe I can prepare myself to deal with people who may harbor such opinions. 
I would not label Elon musk a person of reason... just because he is trendy, tech savvy and young, doesn't mean his philosophy is vastly different from the rest of the 1%. It's all about the tax breaks. \n\nWhy do you think he defended the travel ban on Muslims at first ?
:)
Also... in general, advocate for evidence based policy making.
Obligatory shoutout 
I think your username is relevant...
I think the Conway thing comes from a personal sense of insecurity, as opposed to a desire for money.... but, really, I could be wrong. You dont make millions by "not caring about money".
Ohhh shheeeeeeiiii
I think diversity is important, but more so in the context of different kinds of scientists coming together... people in the social and physical and biological science. Each community has a different perspective on potential White House policies and their impact on society and life for all Americans (and all people). \n\nThis also allows us to strengthen any case we make. 
Sir Alex could be brutal, but if you won him over, you knew he was always going to stand in your corner. Unlike a lot of modern day football, driven by corporate profits, and managing directors, SAF embodied a generation where deep personal connections created the foundation the team. I am convinced that he genuinely cared about his players, and they care about him. This video from the 2016 [Euros!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSh3ROHys4E) really brings that idea home for me... SAF reminds me of a proud dad watching and cheering his sons in their hour of excellence. Right in the feels.
My goal really isnt to prove another redditor wrong or right... I would like to know how people think, so I can figure out make a coherent argument to them. \n\nI'm sure there are people who will just shut me out if I try to do that because they are not interested in evolving their opinions, but I'm sure some fraction of people will be reasonable about it. \n\nI myself have heard a lot of right wing arguments, and it helps me understand their logic and change my views if I think its necessary.  
Meanwhile ... another top thread says he should be our starting SG! 
Not defending trump ... but 2 wrongs don't make a right. \nThere's a pun in there... but it makes me too sad to want to work on my phrasing.
... and they're fired ?!?!?
... so you're not a firm believer in his talent.
Its cool... I come here to engage with the good people on this sub. It helps me see their side of the coin, and, I think, makes me a better person. Also... I feel no love for the neoliberal Democratic party in its current form, so I really am not butthurt. But if it makes you feel better.... \n\n
Wuuuuttt... 
That was well put, good Sir. 
Yeah that is infuriating... they keep saying "we need more competition in the insurance marketplace"... well that's what we had before Obamacare and that shit doesn't work. \n\nI'm not a fan of Obamacare, and I would rather see a public option, but the logic that completion will make rates go back down is demonstrably false! 
And the no look pass!
I dont get that...I'm sure a lot of social and fiscal conservatives are critical of Trump. \n\nI know that the progressive left is heavily critical of Obama/Clinton. And that is a good thing.... why would anyone want to be rigid in their views. 
Lol... I like that comparison :)
Thank you, Op. That's good advice. Just not the part about keep smiling. I think my smile broke. 
I'm pretty sure this is why the offense flowed with such rhythm.... those Randle fake screens set the whole team back. \n\nAlso... DLo could easily have had 3 or 4 more assists. His passing game was on point. Guys cutting to the lane could not handle a few of his bullets. He was clearly upset by that, and I think its good he holds the bigs accountable. But yapping and moaning instead of getting back on Defense is something he needs to not do. \n\nOverall though... great game!
I... I guess it's better that I know this school of thought exists. 
Because that is all he can do... hes a fine public speaker, no doubt, until the time you actually start listening to the words that come out of face hole.
does it even matter... everything he expresses is what is convenient in the moment.\n\nWhen kobe gets the 24 mil a year deal... shit all over mitch and jim. When Kobe scores 60 in his last game... talk as if you were responsible for his career. Nothing he says is is an honest opinion/sentiment. HE IS FAKE NEWS. 
I would not call support for bigoted , unconstitutional and discriminatory policies being reasonable... to me that is appeasement. Yes, that is how companies do business. But when they simultaneously try to portray themselves as benevolent, progressive do gooders, I will call them out on it. 
IT has turned into a fantastic offensive weapon. He clearly had massive upside and wanted to move to LA. That was a massive fuck up by the FO.
I've been quick to jump the gun and label myself a fool for being a Randle hater .... it's the exception, not the rule. Till I see him put together a season of consistent effort, I'm not going down that rabbit hole again 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA
bill walton has some giant teeth...
He doesnt read this subreddit... I hope. But I have totally tuned him out. I no longer read crap he writes, or watch his videos, and I switch the channel every time hes on 710. \n\nAnd I'm glad Max Kellerman is on First Take now, because it makes it easier for me to ignore them both at the same time. Just another fast talking comedian pretending to be qualified to comment on athletes. 
OMG I know a trumper who loves the idea of MAGA. And gates of progressive policies. And he went to school on the GI bill. When I try to tell him that was a hotly debated progressive victory , I get the blue screen error on his face 
Well in their defense... they interpret their subreddit policies as implying that they want an echo chamber. It is a place for conservatives to discuss things -- you are not a conservative, so, adios. \n\nThat's exactly the message I got from their mod. 
Some... that sub used to be pretty sane. Maybe I just had a bad experience.
Oh... I did not know that. I will look into it. I wish they had told me this on the conservative sub. \n\nThanks :).  BTW-- I would say that the fundraising activities of the neoliberal DNC is also pretty appalling. In principle, I see an equivalence in what Trump is potentially doing  and the DNC fundraising. So, yes, it is something of a norm, I too don't think terribly of Trump for just this one thing. But it isnt a norm I agree with.
It's just a recommendation because I sensed that you share a lot of views that I subscribe to, and that this book was a bit of an eye opener for me. I find myself disagreeing with myself a lot these days... \n\nI don't know if you will have the same reaction to this book as me, or if it will provide you more strength in your convictions. But either way, my sense was that you would find this book interesting. 
Thats probably not even in the top 10 most idiotic things he has said.
Clearly, it's George Soros and the lizard people at work .... but the MSM doesn't want to tell you that 
Is it just me or does it look like the lakers have some rhythm to the game tonight....
Sadly, some of these things are entrenched in culture and are harder to implement. Cultural institutions are more prone to inertia than financial ones.\n\nI would say that I think some of the issues you have highlighted have come a long long way since 1947. 
Yeah... that sub has been pretty nice to me overall. I've liked reading what they have to say. 
You mean on the second floor?\n#BasementDwellersUnite
So you think he is profiting off his presence at Mar-a-Lago? But its OK because its not much money?
SAS is going to take all you motherfuckers down. Nobody gets him mad and lives to tell the tale... like that no good fuckface, Kevin Durant. Nobody knows where he even is anymore.....
I was confused too... it sounded like this user recognizes that Trump is making money off his office, but since it is not a significant amount, it doesnt matter. \n\nWhen I asked for a clarification, I got a response along the lines of "was I unclear in my response". 
More value judgments. Disregarded. 
reminds me of Enron ... borrow from the future, declare yourself so fucking rich that everyone wants to give you more money... borrow more money and call it growth
LOL! That sucks.... they told me the reason I was banned is because I admitted to "not being a conservative"! I think you were charged with the same crime :). Any difference in opinion will not be tolerated! 
Fox news is turning against Trump? Since when? 
Sure... I get that Clinton voters are pissed and such. Thats besides the point for me.\n\nBut you do not believe he is profiting off his presence at Mar-a-Lago? All the facts says he obviously is, and  those are your taxpayer dollars he is putting into his own bank account. 
Booker has an amazing offensive game. I can see him dominating the league in that department a few years from now. Ultimately, what will matter is who turns out to be the better defensive player. 
How do you know who was and wasn't instrumental ?
I just got banned from r/conservative for trying to ask folks how they are OK with this. I genuinely wanted to know. It flies in the face of every principle of fiscal conservatism. 
I dont trust Jeanie to be a good GM. Shes not at all a basketball person, and I always think back to the time when she ran that PR campaign to keep Dwight Howard in town.... that was really pathetic. I did not like seeing the "STAY" posters all over town, and it irks me to this day. \n\nThat said... her biggest asset might be that she isnt a basketball person, and she knows that and will defer to the opinion of someone wiser than her. Although Jim and Mitch have drafted reasonably well, they have obviously not kept the franchise relevant, and if it is time for a change... maybe a very hands off Jeanie will be fine. 
Through history, the question of left/right/center has often been referred to as the "social question". The reason is that the interests of "capital" or "ownership" and "labor" or "working class people" are often diametrically opposed. \n\nNeo liberalism was an ideology wherein the working class were told that the democrats could serve their interests as well as those of the ownership (wall st, Silicon Valley...) at the same time. It led to the TPP and NAFTA and gutted worker rights across the country. And while average wage earners saw a decline in their quality of life, they saw Wall Street wreck the economy and get bail outs and bonuses. This is what I perceive as being centrist and what led to the trump victory . The crazy thing is ... trump was to the left of Clinton on so many economic issues.
Sadly, you can say that about Obama as well... 
They kind of screwed up their political analysis this year... well, I guess everyone did. \n\nEdit: GUYS.. can I keep my footie and my politics rants on separate subreddits. Thanks. Love you. PS: we can all agree that we are pleased Steven Gerrard had an illustrious career with ~~many~~ no league trophies. 
Mortgage rates need to go up as far as I understand... fed needs to raise rates. The question is m, will they do it quick enough and risk a recession in the next 12 months.

Please don't do this... I'm not a trump supporter, but these broad generalizations will not lead to constructive discussion. \n\nLabeling everyone who voted trump a deplorable just serves as a rallying call for them. Engage them on issues, and listen to what they have to say. Don't dismiss them outright by assuming you're better than them. Please. 
It's not like he's ever going to need Walcott in a title winning game ... 
I agree with everything you just said.... the only cause for optimism is this : Magic has personality and NBA cred like no other, and that means something the next time we are throwing a free agent pitch. \n\nAlso, the current FO was running low on ideas. Maybe a breath of fresh air will help. 
People are saying it ?
It's crazy that he didn't win the California primary... I know it's time to let go of the past, but that was just as unexpected for me as the election of trump. 
It's just such a cynical world where you vote for the lesser of two evils instead of beliefs you hold dear. Sadly, Clinton did not embody the beliefs of many people. Why should the people be held to blame for that ? \nPeople who voted third party believe in libertarian and Green Party ideals, and I have a sense of respect for them. 
Don't bring back coal jobs! 
Your explanation came across as somewhat self contradictory to me... maybe I misunderstood. Here is what I have surmised:\n1- You are not in favor of elected officials using government office to enrich themselves at the expense of tax payers. \n2- You know that President Trump visits his resort, where he has hiked the fees of entrance and membership, given that now members of Mar-a-Lago get to dine with the president.\n3- You believe that the sum of wealth he stands to gain in fashion is minimal compared to his net worth, and are willing to forgive these actions. \n\nThat to me sounds like you're rationalizing corruption to yourself. I asked you, because, I assumed you're smarter than that, and I probably misunderstood you.
She's also been fairly amenable to the idea of war and has fed into the Russia propaganda. I'm just skeptical of any scaremongering, from the left or the right. 
Hahaha... that's actually what I was upset about... these reports about how he is increasing the prices of membership at mar a lago basically amounts to selling access to the president. \n\nThe response I got was : "he is worth 3.7 billion, I don't think he gives a fuck about the money" 
Washington Post is killing it...good for you WaPo!

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825936326264360961\n\nHe started off by saying that the ban is "not as bad as it seems". And thats his opinion, and hes totally entitled to it. \n\nI just dislike the fact that tech CEOs should not go around labelling themselves as champions of a progressive movement, unlike say, the CEOs of Halliburton or Exxon, who, in contrast, come from "dirty money". Its pulling wool over everyones eyes with suave PR campaigns. 
totally... my particular comments actually had a handful of upvotes, and the dude who was offended by my questions was being downvoted (not by me)... so I'm pretty sure there are level headed folks I can see eye to eye with.
Hey... I have a recommendation to make here: a book called Listen, Liberal by Thomas Frank.\n\nIt was a well written summary of the neo liberal movement, and it helped broaden my perspective. It was also released before the elections, so it all sounds very sagacious.
I dont like to aggravate people on purpose, but it is quite a sight when you say that to their face. They've been pooping on SJW for so long (and I get that to an extent), it really irks them when you put them in the same basket as "those precious snowflakes". I would say this is more true for r/t_d than the conservative sub... 
Yeah.. I was bummed. I'm happy to share the exchange if you want. 
Pathetic is continuing to ask a girl out even when she's told you she hates you. 'Pathological' is probably a better word for what America has become.
Yes! My own cancer doctor fired me after I lost my job and had no insurance. So Yes!\n\nI'm so sick of the tyranny of the "positive attitude." Take yours and shove it. My attitude isn't positive and too bad if you don't like it. I offer you no apologies.\n\nIf you're so "positive" you should be able to handle that with a sunny smile remaining intact on your insincere face.
Can somebody give me a good link for watching free. I don't have Bravo and want to see this!!!
Thank you. I feel so miserable. I tried to make a nice thanksgiving for my family but it all came crashing down at the end and my daughter and her boyfriend flew out in a huff right after dinner. \n\nEvery fucking holiday, somebody always flies off in a huff. Since I was a little girl. \n\nI'm so sick of my dysfunctional family. All I want to do is love them and be loved but does that ever happen, no? It's just always fighting and saying the worst things to each other and even when I'm justified in being angry, whenever I get angry they all slash me up to bits so much that my anger soon leaves and I just feel like I do right now....wanting to crawl into a long dark hole and die.
I'm so broke, sorry I can't help, but I shared it on my Facebook page. Good luck.
Oh they all say that. But then they turn around and say and do the most awful things. And when I admit to being depressed and suicidal, like I am now, they just avoid me. Nobody wants to be around someone who is depressed and nobody wants to help. You know what people do? They kick you when you're down. The only nice people in my life are animals. Like most people, I can count on my animals more than any person I've ever met.\n\nI think people miss you in the abstract. But when you're miserable to their face. They don't want you around.
I was most saddened by how Carrie Fisher refused to take care of her physical health despite having every incentive available to her. Including the hunky personal trainer sent by Lucas Films for an entire year to get her in shape. She does the bare minimum with nothing but complaining, lights up a cigarette as soon as her half hour exercise machine is done, and then replaces the Coke he pours out so her hand is never without one of those, either. It all made me ache for her poor cardiovascular muscle. Isn't it sad that someone who had so many people who loved her couldn't take better care of her heart? I hope it doesn't sound like I'm blaming her for her death, but then again after watching her health habits, including insomnia that she says is caused by mania (but which surely couldn't be helped by all that caffeine) she wasn't helping herself. 
I faced this issue when I moved here with insurance which didn't cover this area. I thought I was out of luck. But I spoke to an expert with the state that said my insurer MUST cover me, even if they don't cover this area, as long as I live here. I discussed this with someone from SHINE, an agency that helps the elderly deal with health insurance. You might not be elderly but their service is free so call them and discuss it. You might discover a way to force your insurer to pay an out of network podiatrist here without charging you an arm and leg....and foot. haha, sorry.
Let me come on Reddit to see how many dipshits in the world there are based on asinine comments trying to dispute the simple facts of this post....ah, not disappointed.....
A sacrifice? Does the military not give them paychecks to do their jobs? What "sacrifice" exactly??\n\nYou don't even know what life I live or what I do or don't do, but you automatically assume a military family is making more "sacrifices" than me?\n\nAnd for what? What are they sacrificing for, precisely? \n\nOh wait, it's to keep America great again, right??
I missed Richard Lawson recaps so much. What is he doing now?
Thank you! It's all over a little quadrant of my backyard that I haven't cleared yet. I was wondering whether to leave it and let that part be natural. 
They gave her the power at her last reboot or whatever. The two techs who are terrified of her.
Honestly, I think this would help so much with my depression and anxiety and insomnia. But I'm afraid they won't approve it for that. Any time I've tried to talk to psychiatrists about it they won't even discuss it. But I've heard from a friend in another state who has bipolar disorder that it was prescribed for her and works wonders.\n\nDo you think Florida will allow it to be prescribed for anything other than life-threatening illnesses? Mental health may not be AIDS or cancer, but it can be every bit as life-threatening.
Agreed! His scene is even more amazing now, in context. He was coming alive and quoting Shakespeare. 
No, I did need to get on a soapbox on it. Are we robots or are we human beings with consciousness and minds that can think for themselves? Because that long line of people weren't thinking, they were just being "patriotic robots" who weren't doing anything for military families, just making Dollar Tree richer, but it sure felt so special and patriotic, didn't it? It was a LIE and yes, public lies require people who think to go on soapboxes! And then RANT!\n\nI swear, brains in this country have turned to mush.
I read this comment in Effie Trinket's voice. 
Yep. They say they care. Even if you tell them you're going to therapy and taking meds, do you know what they say in your darkest moments? They yell at you "Adjust your meds!" Like, even when you're complying and doing everything they say you're supposed to do, if it's still not working it's your fault because you need to "adjust your meds."\n\nIf you admit you have mental illness they just use it as another weapon against you.\n\nThe only safe thing to be is neutral. Never show emotions. Never express anything you truly are passionate about. Which is the OPPOSITE of what every mental health professional will tell you to do.\n\nIt's maddening. This world was built to drive all of us crazy.\n\nI read some text messages I shouldn't have between my daughter and my ex-husband on Thanksgiving. My daughter, who always acts concerned and encouraging to my face.\n\nDaughter: Mom's depressed again. I'm avoiding her. I don't want to hear about it anymore.\n\nEx: I don't blame you. That's why we're not married anymore. (NOT TRUE. It's because he was abusive and finally tried to STRANGLE me so I got the courage to leave him after 21 years...but whatever, let's go on....)\n\nDaughter: Yeah. One day she's going to kill herself and then XXX (my one son who actually seems to love and support me) will blame us.\n\nOH GEE, I WONDER WHY ANYONE WOULD BLAME YOU FOR THE SUICIDE OF SOMEONE YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT???? SMH\n\nI feel your pain, mate. (I like that word.)\n\nPeople will stab you in the fucking back, all the time. It's the rare one who won't.\n\nAnd there's always such wonderment when people are concerned for animals, or mourn the death of the gorilla who was shot.\n\nIt's because animals are GOOD! They don't talk shit behind your back!
After all that WTF I'm sort of enjoying the simple stupidity of 'Divorce.' For at least another minute or so...
Thank you so much for responding and offering such good insights. It really helped me through a tough day. My son and I went hiking and then shopping for some shorts for him and I we talked a little about what happened, just enough for me to express some things and him to reassure me, and then it was over and we didn't discuss it anymore and just enjoyed each other's company. I think I will be able to rise above this and work through it. Being able to vent on here and have you respond so kindly made a world of difference. THANK YOU!! <3\n
I'm giving you a virtual bear hug too {{{}}}\nWe're in this together, all alone. lol.\n\nPeople are vicious. I wish I could do without them entirely. I live by myself with my dogs and I wish that were enough. But I miss them. I crave love, still, even after all the decades of betrayals and people showing me, as Maya Angelou said, who they are. \n\nPeople love "winners." They want to be around you if they consider you a "success." \n\nEven Robin Williams who killed himself. Oh sure, there was all this lamenting. But I wonder, were they there to help before he did it? Seems like no, or maybe he wouldn't have been so despondent.\n\nPeople suck. We have to survive despite them.\n\nThe worst thing, the thing that has me worried right now, is that I somehow CAUSE this. That maybe I'm not as nice and compassionate as I think I am. That maybe I'm evil inside and people treat me the way I treat them.\n\nI hate that thought because it leads me to self-loathing and we know where that goes.\n\nBut I'm no different, how am I now and from the times in my life when people have been clapping for me. It's all based on outside appearances.\n\nI'm so sick of people and their bullshit.\n\nAnd fuck that false drama queen friend. Her concern for you seemed like just trying to make herself seem compassionate.\n\nAnd fuck my family when they're mean. Sometimes, most times, I think the only reason I stick around is I know I will get a "win" one day and they will all rally to me. And I hope I have the oomph to tell them to fuck off.\n\nBut I know I wouldn't. If I won the Lottery I would share it with them and forget all the disses and meanness.\n\nSigh. Lots to talk about with the therapist lol.\n\nYou do need to be selfish. All the time, man. 
I love you for posting this and am enjoying giving down votes to all sexists on here who think women should be defined by who they fuck. 
He used his hands to make a snake move away from him and the boy.
There's absolutely nothing beautiful about killing yourself slowly with Coke and cigarettes. If an addict has the strength to overcome addiction to heroin, shouldn't they also then contain the strength to overcome Coca Cola and Winstons? Yes, the answer is yes. No excuses for killing yourself slowly. It was sad to watch and not beautiful at all, not even a little bit. Be honest. That's the first thing they teach you in addiction counseling, is brutal honesty. Just replacing your addictions with others is not overcoming anything.\n\nAnd now you're going to say she wasn't addicted to heroin, she was bipolar. Whatever. She wasn't helping her mental state by sucking down Coke after Coke and smoking cigarette after cigarette and then staying up all night. You even do that for a week and you're going to display bipolar symptoms, even if you're not quote unquote bipolar.\n\nShe created her own problems in life, like most humans do. 
Oh yeah, children are really going to go without Christmas because I told a Dollar Tree employee where to shove his stupid ploy to make money off the backs of "military families."
In this case, that's a blessing. Thanks for the thoughts for peace. It gets a little easier, each year. Time helps. Winning the lottery or falling in love again might help more, but I'm learning not to be greedy.
I'm glad you understand yourself. Good for you, killer.
We need to change the conversation. Stop normalizing everything they do, like it's two sides of a coin. Having an EPA and not having an EPA are not two sides of an issue! The fucking media needs to get on board too. This is going to take a national transformation. \n
What's the dirt that the rat is supposedly spilling? How could you write that blind item and not mention what the dirt is??
THANK YOU! to everyone who participated in this March, from all of us who couldn't because of work or other obstacles. Please know that your actions are SO APPRECIATED by SO MANY OF US who couldn't be there.\n\nAnd thanks for angering the trolls on this thread, too. Anything that angers disruptive trolls is a force for GOOD. Keep up the great work, Tallahassee Good People!!!!
DAE hear "impressario" and [think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4PK0uLI6kU)?
Don't forget fighting any controls on guns. Until the nukes or tidal waves kill us, we will all continue to be sitting ducks picked off by rampant guns while Congress, bought and paid for by the NRA, does LESS THAN NOTHING about it.
Thank you. There's work to keep me warm. And doggies. And my son is driving up to see me tonight so it's fine. Part of me is really thrilled that they're doing a traditional Christmas around a tree again all together. It just hurts to see myself left out in a photo. I feel erased. And it's just a social media construct and not reality. Another danger of being online. But there are dangers everywhere, it's a dangerous world. We weather on most days, don't we? \n\nSorry you're in an empty apartment instead of blasting away with your family. I hope you have doggies.
I'm a liberal and I just wanted to clarify that we're not sociopaths and we don't support landlords evicting disabled tenants. You must have confused us with Republicans.
But judging by this thread sarcasm will outlast everything. I wish I got as much comfort from it as so many of y'all jackholes.
I'm going to go find Pat and her empanadas to talk this out. She'll understand.
It's an element, man. Fire, water, air, earth can all rule you if you're in their domain and they decide to.
Yeah after they won the Lottery it got bizarro.
Maybe you need a shot in the nuts.
Oh gee. Where's your positivity? Paper-thin, if it exists at all.
Why is everything EVERYTHING always wanting its hand in my pocket to "save" whatever it is. The Rainforest. The Democratic Party. The Internet.\n\nGO ASK THE 1%! I'M BROKE!!
Jane Espenson. Her contributions to Buffy's smart humor deserve the top nod. No surprise that Espenson has gone on to do other groundbreaking TV like BSG and GOT.
You forget that in her eyes Buffy was a very troubled teenager who refused to take school seriously and burnt down the gymnasium. This forced Joyce to flee the city with no job! By the time we meet them Joyce had had just about enough of Buffy's disruptive actions. And they weren't about to end but just get worse. Joyce is a saint. So say we all.
Correction. Under Obamacare -- which Republicans have, are, and will be doing their utmost to undermine and destroy -- you are required to have insurance. \n\nBefore that, cancer could be treated as a pre-existing condition and NOT COVERED.\n\nSigned, a cancer patient who is still alive by the grace of God. \n\nWhy are we making this fight about me wanting your mother dead? That's ridiculous and makes me wonder what your real agenda is. Work for an insurance agency, do we?
Thank you. Usually on a nice day like today I would garden. But the backyards all around me will be filled with the sounds of families, kids playing with presents, adults drinking and laughing and lighting bonfires. Being all alone and not a part of any of it, with my own family hundreds of miles away? Nope. Staying inside today. Maybe I'll go to the gym for some endorphins.\n\nMerry Christmas and strength back to you.
I hate Republicans. Everything bad that ever happens in this country, you will find a Republican behind it. Don't you wish we could divide the country? I would LOVE to never deal with another Republican as long as I live. I'm sure I'm not alone. Let's do it, already, America. Split the fucking country in half and let all the Republicans go doom themselves together.
I was going to say this. Mr. Robot is an awesome show, but the Mr. Robot sub enhanced it to the nth degree.
I'm looking for jobs right now. Even if I could afford weed, which I can't, I know that every job will drug test. So I can't turn to it.\n\nI'm glad Seroquel has helped you. I have an endocrine disorder so am very sensitive to meds. I've tried most every antidepressant and mood stabilizer you can imagine. Latuda, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Tramodol, Trileptal, yadda yadda.\n\nThe ones that worked the best, that felt like they were helping? They made blisters all over my body, on even my lips and genitals.\n\nThe others, the ones that don't work so well, either gorp me out or make me feel like I have the flu. \n\nI just don't tolerate pills well. I take Excedrin for migraines and even the caffeine in those makes me so shaky I just have to suffer through a migraine sometimes.\n\nWeed helps, but I can't use it. And when I try, guess what my family beats up on me for? Being so broke that I can't afford to feed myself in the last two weeks of the month.\n\nEverything I try, fails. My life has failed. \n\nBut I don't give up. I get up every day, like I will tomorrow, and I try to keep going.\n\nBut inside, I just want to die. I'm so tired of being sad, and ill, and finding no cures. \n\nI see a new talk therapist next week. That might help, for a few days. But then it's back to living with myself.\n\nI think of myself as a good person. I'm vegan, I love animals, I fight for righteous causes. I know I'm smart and I have talents.\n\nBut everyone in my life, from the time I was a little girl, leaves. There must be something damaged and ugly inside of me, and I can't get it out. I just have to live with it until I die.\n\nI'm getting really tired of it. One day I don't think I will be able to get back up.\n\nThank you for caring. I appreciate you talking to me.
You show me a child whose holiday is brightened by a cheap Dollar Tree toy. Yeah, I'm sure that's at the top of every kid's wishlist.
Ever since the divorce 6 years ago they just prefer to go to his house on Christmas. It's nice, and all decorated, and full of delicious food, and random family members, and presents. I'd go there, too.\n\nDo I matter? I think I mattered two decades ago when I had to push them out. I feel like that's all I was needed for and I can run along now. But don't mind me, I'm just having my holiday pity party.
Yes yes, wimmen, smile and be polite! 
If you don't want to have a discussion, then don't respond next time, easy as that. Like everyone else in this country these days, you want to talk and not listen. 
I feel like you are wrong and it is more than that.\n\nI think William is trying to "save" the hosts somehow by putting them through trauma. Maybe that's one of the levels of the bicameral mind that leads to consciousness, is fear of one's mortality? 
How rich is the church? And what does it do with its money? Aren't members required to tithe huge portions of whatever income they happen to make?
Maybe all that backtracking helped Rinna's daughter [make her modeling debut in Gigi's runway show](http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/new-york-fashion-week-lisa-rinna-daughter-walked-tommy-hilfiger-fashion-show), hmm?
"I want you to break into hell with me and rob the gods blind." My new OKCupid intro!
Wrong. I'm not embarrassed one bit. \n\nMaybe maybe maybe....maybe you need to take your jingoism and bad logic and go thump it, jerk.
Yikes. I had a friend who was allergic to water like that so I totally get it.\n\nWhat about, just be really nice to yourself. Feed yourself the way you would an honored guest. Do your nails or rub your feet with lotion, or just something really pampering. Just be kind to you, the way you would treat someone you really love? Indulge yourself. Read to yourself aloud from your favorite book. Watch your favorite show. Go get something at the store that you really like, just because you like it. \n\nWe don't treat ourselves nearly as well as we should most of the time, don't you think? It's so much easier to focus on others that we can get lost ourselves. And god knows there aren't armies of people lining up to treat us well.
I've talked to so many professionals and been on so many medications. None of them fix the broken family that I always return to. They're not my parens and siblings anymore, they're my ex husband and my own children. I can't leave my children, even though they drive me to the brink. I suppose I could, but I haven't found one mental health professional who said that is a good idea.\n\nAnd the meds? None of them help. The only think that helps me feel less suicidal is weed, and I haven't met any mental health professional who will recommend that. They will give you Seroquel until you're in a stupor, but a few tokes of weed that lift your spirit? Oh noooo, that could be dangeroussss.....
Yes and they will in a few days. It's just hard today. There's no way around the sadness today. Just distraction.....If you had told me, when I was giving birth to those children, that I would be spending most of their Christmases for the rest of our lives without them, it would have broken my heart. Guess it's good we can't see our futures.
Yeah, forget all the slave labor and inhuman treatment of human beings. That's the perfect Bravo show.
Very cool, thanks for the recommendation.  Yiff stuff, lol, great.  Do you happen to know of any stuff with orcs?
I think Taylor was definitely a victim of domestic abuse. But she is also an extremely shallow and manipulative person, so that's why it's difficult to cling to any pity when observing her. That's probably why Bravo ditched her as well. Who can ever forget her tagline after Russell's suicide "I fought too hard for this zip code to go home now." Yikes.\n\nSo in summation I believe Taylor was a victim of abuse and have much sympathy for her on that score but I also wouldn't invite her for dinner because I'd be afraid she'd steal the silverware.
You see headlines about the need for quality mental health care. But here comes Op just trying to get in the door to see a doctor, any doctor, and nope. You've got this small town with a limited pool of specialists who can just refuse to see new residents. You probably have to know someone and then they can call the doctor on your behalf and get you in. That's how it works in a society set up for the Haves. \n\nSorry, Op. I'm a new resident on a waiting list myself to see an endocrinologist. Sitting with you in the waiting room of the broken U.S. healthcare system.
I'm with you, man. Thyroid cancer here and I almost died because my crappy employer let me go while I was battling it. That was before Obamacare and it was impossible to get health coverage myself after I lost my employers' coverage. Nearly died. The ONLY thing that saved my life was then qualifying for Social Security Disability. Which Republicans call an "entitlement" and want to take away from me, too.\n\nWhy are you trying to kill poor people with cancer, you sick fucking politicians?
Because he has more money and a new insta-family in a fabulous house? Sure. Who wouldn't want to hang out with that as opposed to a single woman in her 50s. Yuck. And your point is?
Agree with you 110%. If you were visiting here from another country and only had Bravo to go by, you'd believe there are none, zero housewives of color in Beverly Hills, New York City, Orange County, Miami or New Jersey, and also no white housewives in Atlanta. Why is that? I would love to ask Andy Cohen that and get a good, long, forthright answer, not that he seems capable of that. I don't have much respect for him or his network. Although I enjoy these shows, they are as shallow as a Trump administration. And probably just as dangerous in their own way, because they do paint a skewed portrait of life and they condone and encourage behavior that even the participants themselves agree is usually staged and over the top. Why do we even watch this crap? I guess it's like playing with a bad tooth, honestly. I can't help it although I know better. 
And I'm having a bad day knowing my ex-husband is having a happy joyous Christmas with his new wife and her 3 kids and the 3 kids that I gave birth to out of my body and raised into adulthood (and carried all the health insurance for everyone, but that didn't buy me a beautiful new home, did it?) \n\nDivorce sucks and the holidays make it suck more. My condolences and empathy to you.
Your mind will be blown by episode 4, have no fear.
Money is what you need to save a life. Without money, you can die. So while philosophically I agree with you -- life should be more valuable than money -- under the U.S. healthcare system, where insurance companies rule everything, money is valued more than life. 
And it is a job, for which you are compensated for, correct? So why does Dollar Tree of all places need to collect money and/or cheap toys for your children? Why not needy children, who have no parents or whose parents have no jobs, why not collect toys for them? I don't understand why they're for you and your children, and why you think you need and or deserve them when there are children whose parents don't have jobs and who might need them more? That is all.
It really doesn't matter what you believe. One gun can end all that nonsense. Argument over.\n\nYou believe what you want. But I KNOW that guns kill people, and there are no controls on them, and that's the end of the human race. Enjoy your guns.
Are you serious? The NYT fawns over the rich and famous, especially those who live in NY. It loves trend stories, especially quirky trends. And it's new "standards" are to be short with photos. This is the perfect modern NYT story. Not saying it's great journalism, not in the least. But it's what they do now.
No, actually, I've fought cancer and now that I'm in remission I'm supposed to get regular sonograms and other tests to insure it doesn't come back and I can no longer afford those tests, so I skip them and only get them every other year, when I can afford it. \n\nSo no, you're wrong. Having cancer doesn't magically make you unconcerned about money. Op is fricking right on target.
I think it's brilliant and hope you're right! 
Caprica had angry bots galore. \n\nAnd I don't know anymore about Westworld. I'm not sure who's human or who's not and whether it matters (it does).\n\n
They're basically grownups now. 24, 23 and 19.
Gasp! Maeve is controlling Bernard now! YES!
I think all of the Housewives shows pretend to celebrate women but then do everything to undermine and ridicule the women. Nobody but nobody comes out of these shows looking like an admirable and reliable human being. Is it because the show only attracts drama queens or does it turn everyone into a caricature? Probably both. It's just sad that shows featuring "real" women can't actually allow anyone to be real.
Hate to break it to you, but if you don't have money you can't even get in to many hospitals or doctors. You think you get a choice between being poor or being alive?
I have watched Y&R my whole life but hadn't watched in months. Today I decided to tune in and Erika just happened to have her screen time start today! What are the odds?!\n\nShe's playing a got-get-er type Realtor who bumps into Ashley coming out of the coffee shop and Ashley accidentally spills coffee on her "couture outfit." lol. They get into it a little and call her each other "What a bitch" and walk away, but then Ashley later approaches Erika and apologizes and offers to pay for her dry cleaning. They get into a conversation and Erika ends up trying to sell Ashley a house and finding out she co-owns a family business and she gets a gleam in her eye. That's it so far. And no, her name isn't Erika but I can't remember what she called herself.
You keep calling me a troll. I think you're wrong. A troll, as I see it, is someone who provokes people just for fun. I'm not provoking you for enjoyment. I don't even enjoy conflict, actually. But what I refuse to do, in all situations, including Reddit, is to pretend or lie. I am not "positive" about the shitty healthcare situation in America. I'm not even a "positive" person in general. I feel pretty dismayed about any number of things, and I see no reason to look on a bright side which isn't there.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, there is no enjoyment in misery. But I'm not exactly miserable, either. Just painfully realistic.\n\nEnjoy your positivity. Try not to become so unnerved by someone who refuses to buy into it.
Really? Here I am amazed at Op's creativity and thinking "Well that's something nobody would expect" and now to hear your husband was ASKING FOR one? People amaze me.
I have been watching Y&R since day one. I even remember the day Ashley had her first scene, coming off the tennis court. I think she was coming home from college. So yes, I can't help but think about Ashley when I see Eileen. And yet I've been surprised at how different Eileen is from Ashley. Ashley is this self-assured, genius chemist and businesswoman. Eileen seems more shy and less boss-like and less entitled. While I love Ashley like a family member after watching her for 40 years, I think I'd rather have Eileen over for tea, y'know? \n\nIt will be sad when the last soap opera ends. Most of them already have. It's nice to have Y&R still running and be able to turn it on especially during the holidays, when all the sets are decorated so beautifully and they usually have everybody from families you've been watching for decades getting together just like families in real life. Watching a story for 40 years it really becomes a part of your life in a great way. 
Oh, like other people in other jobs don't make the same sacrifices?\n\n
Thank you so much for your prayer and kind words. I think I will be able to get through this. I feel a little empowered even, at least I know the score now. Being able to vent on here when I had nowhere else to go made a world of difference. Thank you SO MUCH for responding. I pray that you get blessings in return. <3
I feel you. My family says they want me to stop talking about how I want to end it, but then every other week they do something new to make me want to. If they really didn't want me to get suicidal, you'd think they'd stop pushing me to the brink.\n\nI'm sorry that was all about me. I was trying to reach out to you. I get very selfish and narcissistic when I'm depressed though, and it's hard to care about anyone else, really.\n\nI've been drinking champagne while taking benzos tonight, which I know is a very bad thing. But I'm just so over it, y'know?\n\n
People cheat. Especially men. It's just what they do. \n\nI'd concentrate on my pregnancy at the moment. You're about to give birth and like it or not, that new little adorable human is going to need and want and deserve most of your energy, all day every day. See a therapist to process your feelings because you don't want them to harm you or the baby right now and pregnancy is no time to be feeling what you must be right now. They can also give you a safe place to plan what to do about your marriage. Good luck, be safe.
Y'know what, my father served in World War II. So that makes me a "sacrificing military family." \n\nSo I get all the soapbox I want.\n\nAnd if military families truly are sacrificing? They deserve a helluva lot more than some crappy Dollar Tree toy.\n\nWhy you cannot see behind this shabby ploy at making money off the backs of military families is beyond me. But my soapbox remains intact.
And I hate to break it to you, champ, but your "sacrifices" aren't any greater than anyone else's in life. You're not a hero because you can hold a gun and have been trained to kill people. In fact, you're sort of the opposite. You're a warmonger who is paid to kill. You destroy societies. Chew on that.
An old Selectric typewriter my mom brought home from work. I must have typed hundreds of millions, probably billions?, of words since then and it just never stops...
I was just thinking that. She has the loveliest skin!
Can you get your hands on some weed? I'm going to assume no, you can't or that doesn't help. That's the thing that I will do, illegalities be damned, rather than off myself.\n\nWhat about swimming? Believe it or not, swimming will do it too. If you don't have access to a pool, what about a bath? Just sit in there forever until you turn into a prune and let the world soak out of you??
BIG CLAPS for Police Chief Tyrone Oliver!!! In other cities cops can kill people and keep their jobs. This one was clearly a loose rage cannon and it's nice to know there are other cops on the force who won't tolerate inappropriate harassment of civilians. 
Wow, quite the load!
That's what I noticed.  Don't think it's ALL surgery, she works hard.
She's holding up real well :)
And I'm saying it doesn't matter what she had or did in the past, she wasn't helping anything by willfully refusing to exercise, swigging down Cokes and chainsmoking. I DO fault her for that. She knew better and certainly CERTAINLY had people telling her better. She chose poorly. It wasn't a disease that made her do that, it was her own free will. And I'm calling her on it, because it was inconsiderate and self-indulgent. The fact that you want to excuse her bad choices and forgive it all is your business. 
He's so angry at me for crying and being hurt. I wish I could stop feeling those things. I guess I can put on a false face today and pretend, right? Is that the best thing to do? I just dont' even know how to act or feel anymore.
I love her ink
Looks more real than her lips, which I also love ;)
Getting ready :)
Have to ask the admins, but if you scroll down you should see plenty of removed posts 
Agreed, we're living in an overly PC world.  Some people are into this kind of bimbofication, some aren't.  No one is being hurt, nor is any idea being silenced (well, no feminist or liberal idea, this guy is being forced to apologize).  
How you gonna do a monster hunter comic, without any monsters? :/
I like the tree, did you make that too?
Sloppy is good :)
Hopefully you find it, she looks like she could be anything from innocent to abused ;)
doesn't look too consensual ;)
Agreed, but remember, that 'backlash' is a wildly over used word.  A few upset loud SJW get way too much attention at times.  This guy shouldn't have to apologize, because he didn't do anything wrong.  And for what it's worth, being honest and realistic about the myriad of lifestyles a woman can lead, is a good thing.  Some are bimbos, some find erotic desire in the wanting to be and revel in the release of fantasizing about these transformations.  Even if this is a statement, political, social or otherwise, it's not a bad one, and in a freedom of speech country, he or she should be free to do this.  
Who cares, I certainly like it :)\n\nThe X-ray and the taboo, heck yeah :)
I can't believe how small she is compared to Giana Michaels
I think that 'feminism' and liberal ideas about women need to take into account the history and they myriad of roles women can take.  Including, bimbo, gold digger, slut, and etc.  I wouldn't apologize for making art that shows a a smart woman transforming into a bimbo, there is already enough shame in our culture around sex, one voice to the contrary isn't bad, in fact it's good.  People are free to do and say what they want, and this doesn't hurt anyone. 
Oh is she a cam girl or something? 
Soooo pretty
Wow, impregnated AND treated like a dog?  This guy has his shit figured out!
Which one?
I think there's something thrilling about seeing women, the 'persued' sexual gender, actually indulging in carnal lust.  ;)\n\nPlus, this particular woman has like, PERFECT tits.  
Not falling to your death once, is the biggest achievement here ;)  Good work!\n\n(crouch walk!)
I love this kind of content, great post :)
I love all these people with patreon accounts committing wild copyright infringement.  
metroid is a nice touch
I like the idea of wallpapers, I wonder if /b/ has a thread on this....
Hey, I've got a follow up question.  \n\nThe hotel room booking is from the 8th to the 13th.  But as I look at the schedule here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bA4mjG9orwJxVw-hP02ZDK-o8pFwUgaayxw0_iGCDSk/edit#gid=0 it's hard to see what is going on the whole time.  Is it worth while to be there for the full five days?  Or should I go for shorter amount of time?
Who does their first facial on camera, surely she tried this in her private life first. 
Not complaining, but how is this western?
lol\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the downvote
What a lucky lady!
Keeps his eyes on the clothed girl?  Men :/
Very interesting.  Do you know what kind of play you can get up to with that thing on?  Seems to small to fit a cock through it.  
I've played lvl 8 towers at level 4
Love it, really fun
How do you drop down or go back to prior arenas? Couldn't figure it out, thought it was impossible.
I've had some luck on etsy and ebay.  I found one company that will put whatever words you want on ebay, and I have a similar pink on from etsy.  Can't recall suppliers though, sorry.
What's happening here?
When the courts look at the parody argument they guage a few things, one of which is trying to make profit.  Another of which is the supposed 'value' of the criticism, comment, teaching, scholarship etc. like you or the Egoraptor said.  As far as I know, pornography is looked as having little value from that aforementioned list.  When you combine that with the fact that this is actually an enterprise for profit, then I think your odds of surviving via a parody argument are low.  \n\nPersonally I'm not that big of a fan of copyright law as it stands, but that's how I think it plays out currently.  That's my two cents.  I didn't downvote you :)
I think you mean "blue"
Which happens to me at least 7 times a day.  
More like her cheeks...  Let's hope she can do more than suck the head.
Sometimes I think having a dick would be the best thing ever.
It's Siri
Daily Basis, ahmen!\n\nWhite people aren't allowed to complain about anything.  Affirmative Action?  Fuck you white people.  "Diversity hire?"  Fuck you more qualified white person.  \n\nNo one is trying to say that some minorities don't have it bad.  But why do you got to hate on and discriminate against white people.  We're good people, and for the record many of us have tried very hard toward inclusion and equality amongst the races, and some of those very people have reacted with backlash and discrimination.  Women Buisness Owners Association?  Mexican Business Owners Organization?  And when we say something we get attacked, called 'delicate snowflakes' by ignorant SJWs who only want to silence whites.  It's sad.  
This is probably why they are FINALLY going to offer their product for ala carte subscription. \n\nSorry assholes, too late.  You can't wait until your death grip is no longer effective, and then hope that'll be friends.  
I love the split screen, that's fun.  And the way she tries to reach behind her as he picks up speed, but then realizes that she's not in control and just getting fucked :)
Yeash, look at the size of her tits, can't blame him for being distracted. 
You realize that even if something benefits me personally, that doesn't make it a fair or just idea.  Hiring should be based on most qualified, we should work to make education better, but not employ unskilled and disenfranchise the skilled.  
Ah, college :)
how cute :)
Oh I see this maked as deleted, I was just goofing around, I like the post, I hope i didn't get you in trouble!>
I don't know what I like more, the title or her face ;)
Very pretty
Almost as much as I like that shirt, your piercing and your hair... Dayum bitch, leave some for the rest of us!! ;)
Ah, yes, the giginox armor ;)
Yeah!  PUll on it!
At least she's staying warm ;)
That's simply not true.  We are seeing the pendulum has swung the other way.  From Affirmative Action to the Oscar, we are now seeing in our society a discrimination against whites and males, they now have to take a back seat to less skilled and talented minorities, at times, because there is a preference for minorities.  That upsets whites and males, and reasonably so.  Trying to call them racists for wanting fair treatment is just pushing them towards republicanism, conservatism and people like Trump.  You act like that, this is what you get.  
These girls have mindbroken, now that they've accepted their roles as breeding stock, they can let go and enjoy it.
The graffiti is pretty fun :)
Happen to know of a good video downloader?
These places wouldn't be considered industry, nor would they be considered centers of commodity production. Homes are first and foremost determined by use-value; shelter from the elements, a place to keep your things, a place to raise a family, a place to have sex, and so on. Therefore, if you live in a home it is now your home, and the need to sell your labor to a capitalist to maintain access would be dissolved, which includes dissolving the landlord/tenant relationship, and the creditor/debtor relationship. We'll dig into the latter a little later. As for the former, basically all absentee ownership of land and property would be abolished, and they would either become owned by the people using it, in the case of homes and small to medium non-socially necessary businesses, or if socially necessary, reconstituted at the national, state, or municipal level to guarantee access debt-free and free at the point of delivery. \n\nA newly formed socialist society would first and foremost be concerned with the relationship of the mass of people to their governing bodies. These would be reconstituted around consensus democracy, and would include mechanisms for instant-recall of representatives, as well as direct access at the community level. There are a bunch of ideas for this so I'm intentionally leaving it open-ended. \n\nSecond, they would be concerned with finance, particularly the creditor/debtor relationship. A socialist society would guarantee debt-free, and free at the point of delivery, access to the socially necessary resources the mass of people require to reproduce their existence, namely; housing, food and water, healthcare, and education. How this takes shape will be determined on a variety of factors, but the way I see it the Federal Reserve would be made a wholly public and transparent institution subject to democratic accountability, the largest financial firms on Wall Street would be broken up and reconstituted into public state banks along the lines of North Dakota's, and the remainder would be reformed into small, local, depositor-owned and managed institutions. The depositor-owned credit unions would collaborate with their public counterparts to provide debt-free access to the socially necessary resources the mass of people require to survive, as well as directing capital to create and grow worker-owned cooperatives and tenant-owned collectives in their communities. Money would basically become a means to grease the wheels of production and distribution, as well as to provide a way for the exchange of non-socially necessary items. Like pizza restaurants, breweries and pubs, and so on. These would become worker-owned and managed. \n\nThird, a socialist society would reconstitute hospitals, clinics, schools, and colleges and universities into socialist models. For instance, the hospital would be managed by the doctors, nurses, administrative staff, maintenance staff, janitorial staff, cafeteria staff, and so on, themselves through consensus decision making, and they would collaborate with their political counterparts to guarantee debt-free and free at the point of delivery access to every man, woman, and child in the community the hospital serves. \n\nSame with schools. Teachers, students, parents, administrative staff, and so on, would manage the school themselves through consensus decision making and collaborate with their political counterparts to guarantee debt-free and free at the point of delivery access to every man, woman, and child in the community the schools serves. \n\nInfrastructure. All systems of infrastructure would be held and managed by the municipality they are located in. Therefore water, electricity, internet, waste-water removal, garbage removal, and so on, would be freely distributed and provided at the municipal level, with the members of a community managing these systems themselves through consensus decision making. \n\nFood production. The largest farms and basic food producers would be broken up and reconstituted at the municipal level, with production being managed by the workers themselves through consensus decision making, who would collaborate with their political counterparts to guarantee basic access free-at-the-point of delivery, and, at a nominal fee to non-essential worker-owned food stores and restaurants. The largest essential food stores and distribution channels (Walmart, and the like) would be seized and reconstituted at the local, state, and federal level to guarantee free and fair access. \n\nEvery major industry would be seized and either nationalized or reconstituted at the municipal level and networked together with other municipalities. \n\nThere's a lot of weird, and somewhat unformed, ideas here. Part of that is because there are things we (and I) just don't know, and partly because I wanted to leave things open-ended in the interest of collaboration and discussion. \n\nIt should also be noted I don't really consider money, banks, and markets as intrinsically capitalist, and the degree to which they exist they should be subservient to providing socially necessary resources to the mass of people, and prevented from threatening the ability of society to accomplish these things. Therefore debt is removed from money and capital accumulation is strictly contained, banks are small and owned and managed by the people utilizing them, and markets are left for non-socially necessary frivolities, and kept in check from creeping into socially necessary resource allocation. 
I really like her work, it seems well designed.  Like there is skin where there should be and ink along with it.  
Unlikely
omg, I love his tattoo
College is the best, good for you for making the most of it!
No kidding?  Would you mind if I inquire what kind of money you guys make doing that?  
Wow, this is just a movie huh?  Not a playable game?
That's how life works
This is why I could never understand why people like cam girls.  They seem so clearly to be 'whores', people who will do anything for money, and never really express a shared interest or real sexual attraction.  
Well first of all:  Japan!\n\nSecondly, how is this wrestling?
I've never played any of the 3d games.  Any good ones?  \n\nI usually go for interracial stuff or fantasy.  
I love this tattoo
The chain is fun :)
yeash, that guy cums forever in such thin streams.  
Oh I don't judge the girls for doing it.  I'm more talking about how it's not sexy for the customer.  
Congrats!  She looks like she's well built for some heavy riding ;)
Where's the devil?  I want to make a deal, to look this good!
Love the writing
Not bad, but at that age you gotta be good at what you do as well ;)
Gosh I hate that people and companies announce things through Twitter :/  Good thing people in here have a nice summary so I don't have to sit through it.  Thanks all !\n\nEDIT:  People are so into twitter they gotta hate and downvote?  lol, whatever.  Twitter is incredibly stupid, for so many reasons.  
not bad, but shoulda been Bones !!
That was really good, aggressive work... right up to the end ;)
I guess her clothes are....
Mmmmm.... that's pretty disingenuous consider that there was a media 'outcry' on the very issue prior to nominations and then there was a sudden shift to compensate for the very thing being complained about. And that's before we even get into the statistical probability of such a thing happening.  \n\nWhile the opinion on art performance is indeed subjective, the position you're taking here, as though it was just mere 'coincidence' is, well disingenuous and you know it ;)  We can hold ourselves to better standards than this.  
I figured something like this had to have gone down.  While all the angst? 
She's a brick shit house, so she has a few good interracial scenes ;)
This is not a phenomenon limited to Japan, I see Americans do this constantly.  \n\nBut for what it's worth, having been to Japan, I can tell you that the food preparation over there is taken WAAAY more seriously, especially presentation.  
I like how much she complained
wifeysworld?  Are you sure?  I thought that site was just her and her husband.  
No opinions?  I see I got a downvote, but am genuinely curious and trying to learn
She'll be back ;)
There are 3 sequels, one of which is more a side piece.  I highly recommend you read them all. 
This artist has a lot of good work, you'll have to google it though because some bot nazi sent by the admins is removing any links. 
I think that's also where the Koopa Kids come from ;)
How is that relevant?\n\nedit: On NYE in germany they didn't they didn't release perpetrators back into the streets after catching them which is the part I was saying is unlikely.\n
Is there a point in watching a Youtube video of a random guy which is obviously biased. Seems like he started with a theory to make liberals look bad and worked backwards.
It honestly seemed to be his argument. \n\nSo that article and those organizations are fake? You keep dodging what the tweet said?\n\nHow about this,  find me an article that was critical of Trump that he said he was okay with. 
Yea that's exactly what happened, just replace soviet union with /r/conservative. \n\nThe point is that pointing out someone else doing something isn't a defense of that something. \n\nStop protecting. Good day
Not what a anyone was saying... 
If you actually want an answer to the question here is a good article on it.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/17/islam-reformation-extremism-muslim-martin-luther-europe\n\nThe reality is ACT argues a simple and uninformed view of Islam that just promotes fear and hatred.
But do those militaries want to do it? 
That's not true, some subs that are often filtered on all and nsfw subs are blacklisted.
That's not even true though 
The problem is he specifically calls out only news organizations critical of him. But not ones just as if not more culpable like fox news and Breitbart. He isn't making social commentary on the state of news organizations, he is saying don't listen to these people everything they say is lies. Which is a gross exaggeration.  
Some states in the US as well.
Thats the point I'm making. When people say "wrong side of history" they think the people of the future will look at things differently than the majority of the people in the present.\n\nThere were always people who thought slavery were wrong for instance. You pretty much have to be the winning position in order for someone to say you are the wrong side of history\n\nedit: Majority of the people in the present
Context is everything. Dumping everything to wikileaks without concern isn't okay but there are things the people should know that the government tries to hide. Like illegal spying.
where do you live?
Read this article. \n\nAuthor goes to an ACT meeting.\n\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/love-lives-in-whitefish-but-so-do-neo-nazis?utm_term=.bgWAROZYx#.yvdNq6bPz
Can you source this stuff?\n\nHow can illegals be on welfare? Their children? But the children are legal in many cases.
Seems super unlikely...\n\nedit: The releasing people back onto the streets after 48 hours seems unlikely.
I mean WAPO is quoting criminologists and people that study that data you saw on google for a living. \n\nIt seems like a decent article, they aren't saying there aren't issues but that Trump mischaracterized the problem.
I completely agree. But also he shouldn't have been trying to convince others how they look at sex with children is wrong. Big difference between here's how I feel and why I feel that way and here's how I feel and why you are wrong. 
What is?
The video opens with complaining about Obama and liberals. So yea I'm not wasting my time precisely for the reasons you \nmentioned. Basically if someone starts an argument with all liberals or all conservatives do this then I can pretty sure I'm not interested. He is just trying to insult liberals instead of defending an actual position. \n\nAnd really the saying isn't that complicated, it's just a way of saying you believe their position to be morally wrong. The defense should be to defend the position, not attack the statement. \n\nYou are using the political science definition of liberal but the US political definition differs. Both conservatives and liberals in the US are offshoots of classical liberalism. The Republican party is actually more American neoconservative now though. A lot more intervention. \n\n\nhttp://m.sparknotes.com/us-government-and-politics/political-science/political-ideologies-and-styles/section4.rhtml\n
No, I'm responding to the point you were attempting to make in comparing Muslims to Nazis.
> Your criticism of someone else's behavior is not justified if you are also engaging in that behavior\n\nFalse.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque
By what measure? 
She has a chronic illness, she definitely would have hit the out of pocket max. Really the only thing Obamacare changed for her is that if she went off her insurance for a day she would still be able to get insurance. She is just mad she wasn't eligible for assistance that didn't even exist before.
Well not strictly true, approval rating of congress is less than the media.
That's fine. I can just see how politics is different in that way so may be less filtering 
Then I have  no idea what your point is. You make ridiculous claims and provide no proof and just call people liars despite the written evidence to the contrary. \n\nYou just ignore the things people say and attack them. \n\nGood luck with that going forward. 
I wasn't antagonizing.  /r/asktrumpsupporters has the same rule but even more strict.\n\nThere is nowhere you are allowed to argue against specific posts or comments made in the_donald.\n\nMany other subreddits are the same way but to say it's not a safe space because these other subreddits exist isn't true.
Yea CNN reported its existence but didn't print it like Buzzfeed did. Nothing CNN reported was fake at all.
Did you read the tweet? He called them all fake and enemies of the American people. \n\nHere is a specific article he ranted about in the press conference. His logic was nobody called him so it must be fake. \n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/spies-keep-intelligence-from-donald-trump-1487209351\n
Well he did say they had a problem with Muslims rapists but his source didn't say anything about muslims.
23% of the world is Muslim if that helps. You could also look at Jordan and Kuwait. \n\n
He said it only targets terrorists, which is clearly false. So the question is what is his motive? Seems like it's to keep people in Syria.
You are really comparing 23% of the world to Nazis?
\n\nLol. You asked me to it and I did.  \n\nAlso your entire argument was that he didn't say that,  so thanks for admitting you were wrong 
Great post.\n\nIt also shows how the situation in Sweden really has no parallels to the US, where there is still a lot of entry level jobs in many areas.
I don't think that is true based on the announcement 
How was this person getting healthcare before Obamacare? She is mad because the new financial help (that didn't exist before) doesn't apply to her because they make too much money?\n\nIn the past if she let her insurance slip for a day she wouldn't be able to get it at all.\n\nShe was ignorant from the start.
Of course it's an opinion 
But anything he doesn't like he calls fake so... 
People keep saying this, with no actual quotes.
The last paragraph seems to be the best pont\n\n>“Sweden definitely, like other countries, [faces] challenges when it comes to integration of immigrants into Swedish society, with lower levels of employment, tendencies of exclusion and also crime-related problems,” Selin said. There is little evidence, however, that Sweden has turned into the lawless country it is at times being described as abroad.\n\nThis is super complicated of course, and I haven't read any articles from the media that large scale immigration is easy. But Trump certainly mischaracterized it. Not everything worth doing is easy.
there wasn't a group arguing to do it.
You made something up, got called on it, and then changed the subject.\n\nHow is it bullshit to say a group who argues to discriminate against entire classes of people is a hate group?
Anything about Russia, Immigration or Muslims will be brigades without fail.
It could be a million times more likely, of course it's hateful to target a group of people because of the actions of a few.
I hope he gets the help he needs but saying older men preying on children is okay shouldn't be accepted regardless 
He can't mention the NYT without saying "failing New York Times". What is the point? 
Yea so you are making a moral argument, not a logical one.\n\n>Perhaps you should climb back up this thread and tell that to the guy who has in no way shown that r/conservative behaves the way he accuses them of behaving.\n\nThats what you should have done instead of making or moral or fallacious argument maybe?\n\nGood day for real this time, good luck in the future being a dick.
They are arguing they are evil and can't be a legit US citizen.
Maybe, every headline and article is going to be somewhat misleading. Fully understanding this super complicated issue would be very difficult. I like that this article quoted criminologists and people that have studied the issue at least instead of putting up charts with no context.
Nobody is saying it is.\n\nBut even if that stat is true if you start arguing against every single Muslim or to discriminate against them it's a hate group. 
I think you don't know what those terms mean. Sorry but what you are saying makes no sense from a political science perspective. 
Wow, did you even read the article. Bigfoot knew she was sleeping with the loch ness monster and was fine with it but now he's using that as an excuse to not take care of the baby!\n\nMy mom does ultrasounds and she says thats fur!
Yea, also titles that end in "lets see this in /r/all!!!!" probably make people filter lol
Always good to find the best source. \n\nI think it's tough when Fox aired a clip of a super biased "documentary" without fact checking or any context from the Swedish government and then the President quoted it with no real knowledge of what he was talking about. 
It's hard to find any "official ACT position." Just because they said they don't think all Muslims "must be stopped" doesn't mean they don't disparage every Muslim.\n\nMuch of their messaging is convincing people that Muslims and Islam are bad.\n\nedit: Changed "goal" to "messaging"\n\n
Haha. Yea maybe that would work. I stopped going there after seeing upvoted posts and comments after the election on how global warming isn't a problem when before they election they all claimed trump was good for the environment.\n
Lol, the first 10 seconds he just bashes Obama and liberals for using the term. Because no conservative have ever used it.
Even if factually correct seems like a poor comparison. One is a long term solution and one is not. 
Yup totally agree
He literally won't mention the nytimes without saying failing. It's like a fun catch phrase! 
Because anti liberal does not equal conservative. I can hear view points whose point isn't to simply make the other side sound bad 
Well it is the question because we don't have enough power, other than military, to make them. And if our military is getting involved more, which I don't think it should, we would protect safe zones ourselves.\n\nWell not every refugee is fleeing ISIS or other terrorist groups, Syria's civil war is mainly not ISIL although they are involved.  \n\nI don't think it's nearly as simple of a problem to solve as drafting all the young men to fight ISIS or they are somehow to blame for the conflict.
Well even if that is true, which really depends on how you define terrorist, if you are arguing to discriminate against an entire group of people (23% of the world actually) because of the actions of a few then I would say you are a hate group.
You are incredibly rude first of all.\n\nSecond of all, justified means legitimate reasoning. It's a legitimate criticism regardless of anyone else's actions.\n\nMaybe you mean it isn't moral for them to accuse them of something they are doing? Which by the way you have in no way shown, because there have been plenty of news articles showing things were false flags that were upvoted.\n\n\n
I wouldn't accept that as a source either. Would you?
Yup agreed 
It seems to me they didn't have a photo of the criminal in that case? Or it is some sort of standardized public announcement template.\n\nWhy do you have a cache of this stuff lol.
In the US you certainly are expected to become a legal permanent resident. Not sure about other countries but I bet it's way more likely to not move back to the country they fled from 
What, it's pretty clear they are saying that they think history will look back at these people as mistakes.\n\nLots of people won things but history frowns upon them. So you are saying Hitler was on the right side of history until he lost or what?
They didn't release perpetrators back into the streets after catching them. 
Some tabloid supposedly editing photos means its more likely they are releasing rapists?\n\n
Someones legacy is certainly not locked in when they die.
According to Felipe Estrada Dörner, a criminology professor at Stockholm University it is not a lie.
If you are arguing to discriminate, it's a hate group.
If you would actually like to know the issue is that you are hearing that they don't count. But what people are saying is that these stats don't point to the narrative that people are using them for. \n\nSo of course every rape is a tragedy and we should try to prevent them and prosecute offenders but at the same time don't try to twist every tragedy to fear monger about immigrants. \n\nThe crime and immigration issue in Sweden,  and everywhere, is super complicated so don't get caught up in either of the extremes. \n\nTry to find what the actual criminologists in Sweden are saying 
Picture that represents above commenter. It's a picture of a projector 
https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065\n\nSo your defense is that every article critical of Trump from the organizations on that list is fake? \n\nYea that isn't true.  
Wtf those comments 
They aren't arguing an entire group of people is evil
I think the political subs that get filtered is because people see a dumb meme or a post that ends in "shame if this hits all!!!!" and instantly filter.
If they make a habit of purposefully making stuff up and twisting facts you can't really trust anything they do.
Exactly, but there were clearly points where he was winning. Saying someone is on the wrong side of history is saying that even though they are winning now they will be viewed as a failure by history. Winning doesn't mean you can't be on the wrong side of history, it's practically a prerequisite.
It's crazy how much this sub changed after the election.
Those can both be true.
Sweden is a ton different than the US job market wise. \n\nWent so hostile? 
If he can't see that a man preyed on him using a power advantage then not sure what you can say.\n\nJust because he looks back on it fondly doesn't mean what that man did is okay. He is defending what the man did.\n\nIt's really not super complicated.
Again I don't know where you are even getting that fact but even if true it's not relevant.\n\nYour logic is the same as every white supremacist is a fan of trump, why would you also be fan of Trump.\n\nOr you could just say most terrorists believed in any god, so we should discriminate against all religions.\n\nTerrorists are ridiculously rare, its no reason to discriminate against most of the worlds population (or about a quarter of the world if you are talking about Muslims)
If you don't see a group arguing another group is bad as a hate group I think we are just disagreeing on semantics.
If you are attempting to defend an assertion by pointing out a similar issue in something else that is whataboutism because you didn't actually answer the original assertion. \n\nLook it up \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism \n\n
You may have more issue with OPs summary in the title than the actual article.
Not sure why people on reddit get all worked up when I use the word seems like this.\n\nWould saying "seems to me" or "in my opinion" be better? It is there to make it clear that it is my opinion. But I guess in context it would be clear regardless so maybe its not necessary. But not sure why anyone would care.
Yea they probably didn't use his exact recipe regardless.
Can you post a news source that isn't founded by a PAC?
BLM doesn't want dead cops man, come on.
Or whataboutism is getting real old so down voted 
I feel like there needs to be a saying for every start used to justify prejudice. It's the poverty. 
Just look on  human rights watch. Look at the government. They have their issues,  as does the US. The point is most are just normal people not very different from anyone else. Also I was just mentioning middle east countries. Clearly a ton of Muslims around the world, including in the US.\n\n If you want context on those numbers, which are from 2013.\n\nhttp://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#_ftn5\n\n 
I'm sharing my own conclusions, and attempting to raise some class consciousness in the process. All I ask is that you view developments in the Democratic Party first with skepticism, with an understanding they have a long history of appealing to working people with leftist rhetoric only to abandon us when it's economically or politically convenient to do so. \n\nThe institutional memory of the organization is decidedly anti-working person, and airing a debate between people the rank and file have no direct vote for on a corporate television channel is only barely a development in the right direction, if one at all. \n\nEdit; why was your other comment deleted? I didn't notice anything delete-worthy in it. 
Hey I answered this earlier in a different thread, I'll just share what I wrote there,\n\n>Then you'll be lazy. A small home fit for human habitation big enough just for you would be provided, including utilities, access to food would be guaranteed either through a free-access food store or a guaranteed minimum income, healthcare will be there if you need it, and education will be there if you want it. I can't guarantee you'll have a lot of friends, nor can I guarantee the people in the community will put up with your bullshit, so you'd be ostracized and isolated for the duration of your temper tantrum. But access to the resources you need to reproduce your existence would never be stripped from you. 
Now *that's* a fucking wrench! 
Direct democracy focused on consensus decision making in the workplace (including schools and hospitals) and in your local municipal government, and representative consensus democracy in state and federal governing bodies (minus the Senate, get rid of that shit), in your local depositor-owned financial institution, and in state and federal public banks (similar to North Dakota's state public bank) would limit antagonistic relations considerably.  \n\nMajoritarian democracy breeds antagonism and perpetuates class division. 
I love my credit union. It's the same one my dad used for 25 years, so the oldest people that work there have known me since I was a child. I highly recommend to anyone to use a credit union instead of a private bank, even if it's a little less convenient for you. 
~sniff~
You're so close, comrade. The solution to the common problems of poor and working people are in their own heads and their own hands, not in a system that produced those problems in the first place. It is the goal of any true [red republican](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/first-red-scare-civil-war-european-socialists-bornstein-republicanism/) to create organizations modeled on the society we wish to create that help poor and working communities organize together and [fashion their own solutions](http://imgur.com/ukM0J08) to their common problems. There are some [interesting ideas](https://www.hourworld.org/bank/?hw=1434) already along these lines being fashioned in some of the communities you mentioned. \n\nFurther, one must understand that a quantitative change in a system leads to a qualitative change of that system. Imagine applying heat to a jar of liquid water, if the quantitative change of that heat is sufficient enough it will lead to a qualitative change of the liquid water, namely, the liquid water will transform into steam. This same concept can be applied to society; If a quantitatively sufficient level of class consciousness is held by the mass of people (ideas), and they are organized into revolutionary organizations modeled on the society they wish to bring about (material conditions), they can agitate for change to bring about a qualitative change of that society (transformation).\n\nThis agitation is organizing together to fashion solutions to our common problems, outside of, and counter, to the system that produced those problems. 
I'm not the biggest fan of the Founding Fathers, but Washington deserves a degree of respect. Dude walked away from absolute power, twice. 
Direct and representative democracy *are* different, but there is also majoritarian and consensus democracy. The way I see it direct consensus democracy would be best applied in workplaces and neighborhoods, with representative consensus democracy best applied in depositor-owned financial institutions, and municipal, state, and federal governing bodies. \n\nThe main differences I see between majoritarian and consensus democracy is majoritarian democracy produces antagonism, and perpetuates class divisions, while consensus democracy produces collaboration, and would significantly inhibit, or even prevent, a ruling class from unilaterally dictating policy. 
Lmao crescent wrenches are the worst! They never have enough play for what you're trying to fasten and they break down after only a little bit of use. At least with a wooden axe you can bash the fash, the crescent wrench is just designed obsolescence incarnate. 
It's one of my favorite podcasts, hope you enjoy it. 
I don't think it's necessarily anti-capitalist, but Hillary supporters, or just moderate liberals in general, in their resistance to Trump, are scratching up against class consciousness, and in the act of them resisting, in the form of protests and demonstrations, puts them in direct proximity to anti-capitalist leftists who then have the opportunity to educate them and turn-over like an engine in their head an understanding of class. \n\nWhich I think we all can recognize as being the first and most important step on the road to actual leftist thought. 
I've made no such argument, I'm simply sharing the conclusions I've come to as it regards the Democratic Party, and hopefully raising some class consciousness in the process. \n\nThe solutions to the common problems of working people is in their own heads and their own hands, not in a system that produced those problems in the first place. \n\n
Repetition produces understanding. How about instead of bitching about me you present some of your own ideas. 
I've been thinking of a nesting doll structure, where neighborhoods, apartment buildings, workplaces, hospitals, schools, farms, and so on, are at the center and managed through consensus decision making by the people actually doing the work, and then each layer out are just systems of support composed of delegates subject to instant recall sent from the interior layers. Still kind of an unformed idea though. 
It's pretty great. I also recommend checking out Richard Wolff's [Economic Update](http://www.democracyatwork.info/tags/economic_update) podcast. It's a weekly podcast, about an hour long, and it's pretty great. The first part is him going through the news of the week while applying a socialist analysis, and the second part is usually a conversation or interview with someone about a particular topic. Last weeks was about journalism. Great stuff. 
Yeah, huh. Ok. 
Oh, well of course. I think social norms and customs would included in the material conditions, but it's important to explicitly state them. So thanks for that. 
Exactly. Although I would rather a collaborative relationship between the people and their governing bodies than an antagonistic one. There are ways to do this, and they're rather simple and straightforward.  
I think opening up the leadership to direct rank and file vote subject to instant recall is a perfectly valid idea, and would be a necessary step for any party who wants to be considered the party of working people. If they're not willing to do this, they're not a party for working people, and should be abandoned. 
For anyone interested in a new book in between rereadings of Harry Potter check out the Bread Book. 
So which is it, was Bernie awesome, energetic, and inspiring or was he inarticulate, stammering and bumbling, and "sad?" \n\nYou do realize you sound like a Trump sycophant, yes? 
This is a value judgement on your part, and completely devoid of any counter-arguments, so I'll be disregarding it. 
Your mother is anecdotal, and clearly in need of some psychological attention if all she does is sit in front of a tv. \n\n>Look kid,\n\nYeah, you can fuck right off with that bullshit. I'm through with you. \n\n>Let me in turn ask you, my friend, shall we punish the man whom nature has not endowed as generously as his stronger or more talented neighbor? Shall we add injustice to the handicap nature has put upon him? All we can reasonably expect from any man is that he do his best-can any one do more? And if John’s best is not as good as his brother Jim’s, it is his misfortune, but in no case a fault to be punished.\n\n>There is nothing more dangerous than discrimination. The moment you begin discriminating against the less capable, you establish conditions that breed dissatisfaction and resentment: you invite envy, discord, and strife. You would think it brutal to withhold from the less capable the air or water they need. Should not the same principle apply to the other wants of man? After all, the matter of food, clothing, and shelter is the smallest item in the world’s economy.\n\n>The surest way to get one to do his best is not by discriminating against him, but by treating him on an equal footing with others. That is the most effective encouragement and stimulus. It is just and human.\n\n>“But what will you do with the lazy man, the man who does not want to work?” inquires your friend.\n\n>That is an interesting question, and you will probably be very much surprised when I say that there is really no such thing as laziness. What we call a lazy man is generally a square man in a round hole. That is, the right man in the wrong place. And you will always find that when a fellow is in the wrong place, he will be inefficient or shiftless. For so-called laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely unfitness, misplacement. If you are compelled to do the thing you are unfitted for by your inclinations or temperament, you will be inefficient at it; if you are forced to do work you are not interested in, you will be lazy at it.\n\n>Every one who has managed affairs in which large numbers of men were employed can substantiate this. Life in prison is a particularly convincing proof of the truth of it and, after all, present-day existence for most people is but that of a larger jail. Every prison warden will tell you that inmates put to tasks for which they have no ability or interest are always lazy and subject to continuous punishment. But as soon as these “refractory convicts” are assigned to work that appeals to their leanings, they become “model men,” as the jailers term them."\n\n--Alexander Berkman
The only way to get concessions is by shaking the foundations, but without changing the present order of things those concessions will be constructed such that class division and inequality are simply reinforced.  
I mentioned to the other commenter about having state and Federal area-specific congress' focused on managing and guaranteeing debt-free access to socially necessary resources, which I consider to be; housing, food and water, healthcare, education, infrastructure, and R&D. \n\nThoughts? 
I prefer consensus to majoritarian, even if it's more difficult, because majoritarian produces antagonisms and fractionalization of the mass of people. I think direct consensus on the workplace, neighborhood, apartment building, and so on, level is best, with representative consensus with instant recall at levels beyond that. \n\nAs far as instant recall, perhaps having timed votes-of-confidence (perhaps yearly) would be sufficient to trigger a recall vote. \n\nI think having issue-based congresses focused around managing socially necessary resources are interesting. I consider socially necessary resources to be; housing, food and water, healthcare, education, infrastructure, and basic R&D. Each one of these areas should have its own state and federal congress focused solely in that specific area, with a more decentralized multi-person "executive branch" that sits laterally to the congress' and that's charged with managing inter-congress communication and collaboration. \n\nObviously much of this is unformed, and I'm not wedded to any of it. 
I would rather the debate be produced by an independent non-profit organization and the leadership voted on by the rank and file of the party.  
People are so alienated from the fruits of their labor and each other, and their material conditions so unstable, that they will join almost any group that makes them feel like they're engaging in something meaningful and a part of something bigger than themselves. Even if that group advocates for the genocide of entire groups of people. 
Because being a doctor fulfills you on a personal level. For me, I'd rather have a doctor that's passionate about their work than one simply there for the money. Further, with debt-free and free at the point of delivery access to education, we'd have a hell of a lot more doctors and nurses than we currently do, so you being a little butthead wouldn't be a big deal. \n\nIf the existence of poverty, homelessness, and food insecurity is necessary for you to feel good about the labor you're doing then I think the problem is with you, and not socialism. A socialist society would publicly shame this behavior and ostracize individuals who act like petulant children.  
Define how you're using the word productive. 
The only things we can reasonably regard as "human nature" is our creation and use of tools, our thinking and communicating in language, and our ability to express ourselves creatively. Beyond that is just value judgments reverse engineered to justify the existence and perpetuation of poverty and food insecurity. \n\nThe behaviors that emerge in a given population are a result of the selection pressures imposed by their material conditions. 
By "practical policy" you mean toothless policy completely evacuated of class understanding, and belies a willingness to capitulate to capitalist hegemony. \n\nThe differences that arise between the capitalist parties are a matter of spoils, not principles. Both parties are political manifestations of concentrated private power that position themselves between the People and their legislatures to reduce them to mere spectators of their own governing bodies. \n\nIf the capitalist Democratic Party is unwilling to purge themselves of corporate financial backing, open their leadership to direct rank and file vote subject to instant recall, and supportive of policies that first guarantee open and debt-free access to socially necessary resources, then they are to be considered merely snake-oil salesmen, and are not to be trusted or supported. \n
Political parties aren't the only means by which to engage the political process. That you think this reveals the level of indoctrination the political parties have manifested in the mass of people. 
Perhaps there could be regular votes-of-confidence that, perhaps by a simple majority or other threshold, could trigger a recall vote. Let's say leadership positions are limited to two-year terms, with votes-of-confidence every six months. I'm open to discussing more and varied suggestions. 
Consensus follows [this flow](http://imgur.com/73TBjbb), and is predicated on discussion, collaboration, and building towards the best possible solution agreeable to all people involved.  \n\nThe reason majoritarian democracy has the problems it does is class society itself, manifested in the unequal distribution of wealth and income, and the state being organized not to service and meet the needs of the mass of people, but in managing the competing and conflicting interests of the ruling class while *protecting* their privileged position *from* the mass of people. \n\nThe solution to this is abolishing class divisions; by dissolving conditioned access to the socially necessary resources required for the mass of people to reproduce their existence, or put another way, dissolving the conditioned access to housing, food and water, healthcare, and education upon participating in the employer/employee relationship, the landlord/tenant relationship, and the creditor/debtor relationship. 
At least three periods of intense Red Scare propaganda, and heavy indoctrination through a school system modeled on the factory floor to produce docile and obedient workers. 
Capitalism works by threatening people with homelessness and starvation if they don't conform to the whims and wishes of the ruling class. You bourgeois sycophants view humans as cattle or dogs who need to be beaten with a stick or tempted with a carrot to direct their labors to build and maintain society. Socialism sees society as something humans just do, it's as natural to us as falling in love, or making friends, or thinking in language, or creating art and music is. The difference between the two is socialism recognizes the humanity in the individual, and trusts them to autonomously direct their own labor in ways that builds and maintains a just and free society, as well as enriching and fulfilling them on a personal level. We don't use the threat of death, you do, we'll just isolate you assholes to prevent you from fucking it up for the rest of us. 
What are your thoughts on dismantling the Senate and reconstituting the House into multiple and specific bodies with representatives operating on consensus decision making and subject to instant recall? \n\n(Pie in the sky nonsense, I know. Just curious)
As it regards "human nature" I'll share what I wrote in a different sub,\n\n>The only things we can reasonably regard as "human nature" is our creation and use of tools, our thinking and communicating in language, and our ability to express ourselves creatively. Beyond that is just value judgments reverse engineered to justify the existence and perpetuation of poverty and food insecurity. \n\n>The behaviors that emerge in a given population are a result of the selection pressures imposed by their material conditions. 
What did your interests shift to? 
A working person has about as much of a chance of becoming "successful" as a high school football player has of playing in the NFL. 
I'm not terribly familiar with Third Worldism, so I'm not confident to speak on it. I can say that I think arguing over who is *more* exploited is reductive, and ultimately, useless. More than that, the working class isn't exploited in just the context of the employer/employee relationship, but also the landlord/tenant, and creditor/debtor relationships. 
Exactly. *That* its on CNN should alone be enough to find this suspect. 
I think a significant portion of us have already abandoned the Dems. That their leadership isn't chosen by the rank and file, and subject to instant recall, is enough to not get my support. 
Reductionist. 
It should be noted the DAR is a bourgeois organization. Not to suggest they deserve to be insulted because they are women of course. 
I didn't mean to suggest you said they were the same, apologies. I was using direct and representative democracy to set-up majoritarian and consensus democracy. \n\nMajoritarian democracy produces antagonism so long as the distribution of wealth is concentrated into few hands and class society persists. This condition, paired with representative democracy, produces political parties that are manifestations of concentrated private power that position themselves between the People and their legislatures and reduces the mass of people to spectators. \n\n[Consensus democracy](http://imgur.com/WgsRjb3) follows this flow chart. There are variations but that is the basic gist. Consensus democracy is premised on discussion and collaboration among freely associated people of equal power relations. Which is why I think direct consensus democracy is best applied to worker-owned workplaces and tenant-owned apartment buildings and neighborhoods, with representative consensus democracy best applied to depositor-owned financial institutions, public banks (along the lines of North Dakota's), and legislative governing bodies. \n\nEdit; fixed some things 
Are we talking about Bernie's bourgeois "political revolution" or an actual class conscious mass movement of the proletariat?  
I haven't heard of those, I'll give them a look. Have you heard of the [Bread Book](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread). 
That a person who, on the surface, appears to be small and unimportant, can, through great and bitter work, affect change that betters the lives of millions. 
Fantastic video, I very much enjoyed it. I generally stray away from identifying as a particular leaning, but based on this video it seems I'd be Democratic Socialist with Anarchist tendencies. Thanks for making it, looking forward to future videos. 
>Jesus man cmon, again with the ideal human behavior. How do you expect every human to do this?\n\nIn organizations of free association around consensus decision making, with societal mechanisms that inhibits the ability to individually amass wealth such that someone can unilaterally impose their will on others or legislative bodies. \n\nThe main mechanism to accomplish this is a maximum income tied to a multiplier of the median income (say, 50x), with a guaranteed minimum income determined by, and regularly adjusted to, regional cost-of-living rates. Once you've reached the cap you're taxed at 100%, the majority of which would go to the public coffers of your closest governing body. \n\nThrough a minimum income, and other ways, to guarantee access to housing, food and water, healthcare, and education no-one would have to sacrifice their principles to make money to survive, so an individual or institution would have no carrot and no stick to capitalize on the desperation of poverty to service their own ends (because there would be no poverty). Under these conditions employment would be allowed, because the employer and employee would exist in a state of equal power relations; the worker doesn't *need* the job just to survive, and has the freedom to quit at any time if the conditions of said employment aren't acceptable to them. Over time this would transform the economy by applying to it selection pressures from the individual workers. They wouldn't deal with shit bosses, under shit conditions, so these shit jobs would gradually be phased out as they go out of business and are eventually replaced by worker-owned cooperatives (that could still employ people for a wage). All socially necessary labor (that which provides housing, food and water, healthcare, and education) would be publicly owned and funded by the closest governing body and managed around consensus decision making by the workers performing those tasks. \n\nBy eliminating private banks and moving to depositor-owned credit unions connected to public state banks similar to North Dakota's. These institutions would be tasked with prioritizing the allocation of capital to worker-owned cooperatives, and tenant-owned apartments buildings, mobile home parks, and neighborhoods, and would collaborate with each other around consensus decision making to provide debt-free access to socially necessary resources required by the mass of people to reproduce their existence. \n\nBy abolishing absentee ownership, preventing people from gaining passive income from the labors of other. All property would revert back to the most local governing body, who would fill the vacancy based on the conditions the community has determined. \n\n>Do you really think this is where humanity is at, that everyone just knows how to be a perfect functioning human without laziness or any other negative trait?\n\nOf course not, nor would they be required to be perfect. The only requirement is the willingness to work with equals in collaboration. Also, laziness isn't a thing. What you call laziness I call misplacement, unfitness. People laboring on work that fulfills them and that which they enjoy are far more productive than people forced into drudgery and toil for money just to gain access to socially necessary resources. That you keep coming back to laziness is telling. \n\n>That's what you are telling me that you are, and that anyone who is not advanced as you will be...what did you say? cast into isolation? nice, that sounds like a morally thing to do.\n\nSays the person who seems perfectly fine with poverty, homelessness, food insecurity, and death as a threat to noncompliance with capitalist demands. Compared to that my solution seems downright generous. Ostracization and public shaming of socially detrimental behavior, while guaranteeing access to socially necessary resources, is the humane way of dealing with petulant children. If they want access to the finer things in life beyond just the most basic resources required to reproduce their existence they'll have to end their temper tantrum and collaborate with their peers in groups of equal power relations to do so. \n\nThe rest of what you wrote is a bunch of bullshit, actually everything you wrote is nonsense inference. 
"Middle class" is more of a description of a particular lifestyle, rather than a component of class analysis of bourgeois society. Characteristics of this lifestyle would be  one or more of the following; owning your own home, owning multiple vehicles, being married, having multiple children, living in the suburbs, having a savings, a personal lawyer, and so on. The degree to which someone is to be considered working class, petit-bourgeois, or bourgeoisie is with whom their interests align. Thus, although some who would be technically working class, but live a middle class lifestyle and have access to the privileges that come with it, would be better considered as petit-bourgeois, as in their interests lay with reproduction and perpetuation of class society, and who would side with the bourgeoisie when revolutionary agitation emerges. 
You're annoying. 
Does not realizing value exist in a relationship with producing value? Is the person who puts the product on the shelf and rotates perishable stock, or the person who helps customers find what they are looking for, or the person who helps check people out (I know automated tellers exist, go with me) not necessary in the process of commodity production, distribution, and sale? \n\nWhat's the question behind the question? More pointedly, what exactly are you trying figure out by establishing what is productive and unproductive labor in the service industry? 
What advice was given by that comment? 
Yes. Meaning this debate is just smoke and mirrors, a show, a production put on to convince people they're involved in the decision making process. \n\nAmong other things, a condition of my support for the Democratic Party is them opening up the leadership to rank and file vote. 
Socialism is about dismantling unequal power relations, including the asymmetric landlord/tenant power relation. Owning property you're not actively using to extract from it passive income would be abolished. 
I was watching the first season of Superman the Animated Series and all I could think while watching is why couldn't they build the movies off *that* Superman? Well-adjusted, has fun with his powers, gets into trouble sometimes, and is just all around a bright and positive show, if a little absurd at times. 
Then you'll be lazy. A small home fit for human habitation big enough just for you would be provided, including utilities, access to food would be guaranteed either through a free-access food store or a guaranteed minimum income, healthcare will be there if you need it, and education will be there if you want it. I can't guarantee you'll have a lot of friends, nor can I guarantee the people in the community will put up with your bullshit, so you'd be ostracized and isolated for the duration of your temper tantrum. But access to the resources you need to reproduce your existence would never be stripped from you. 
I think soup kitchens and food banks are fine, and I'm actually in the process of getting involved with a couple in my area, but where I have reservations is their inability or unwillingness to help people organize together and fashion solutions to their common problems. I see this ultimately as a result of hyper-individualism, where we're willing to give out food and clothes and whatnot to people but we're not willing to help organize them. 
I pretty much do the same. I call myself "Just Socialist," in that I'm just a socialist, and don't want to get bogged down in a particular tendency, and I'm a Just Socialist, in that my main concerned is justice for poor and working people, and the most marginalized and disenfranchised peoples in class society. 
>I'm sorry but you hit a nerve of my personal life. Which is landlording, but I don't use a management company to support my building. For I maintain all needed upkeep. I any work I do comes from the rent I charge. \n\nYou're very much the exception to the rule. You may very well be a good person who treats your tenants well, and that's great, but it doesn't make the unequal power relation suddenly disappear. More than that, for equality, and thus freedom, to be realized the tenants themselves should own and manage the building, who would probably contract out your services for the maintenance of said building. You're just an unnecessary middle-man that siphons profits from the rents of working people. \n\nFrom a class perspective it sounds like you're what socialists call petit-bourgeois; your material interests lay with the working class (proletariat), but your capital interests lay with the ruling class (bourgeoisie). That you're siding with the ruling class out of capital interest makes you a class traitor, and explains why you vehemently defend the ideology of capital, as well as how the system perpetuates itself.  \n\n>Why can't I make a profit on my labors or taking a chance in the market? \n\nThere is nothing explicitly wrong with making money, the issue in this regard is the unequal power relations between you and your tenants. The ability for them to protect themselves from you legally (not saying they would need to, you seem like good people) is very much dependent on them being able to afford a lawyer, and thus access to the legal system. Poor and working people are generally barred from this protection, which many landlords (not saying you do) use to shirk their responsibilities to maximize profit, and thus accumulate capital. \n\n>My comment that move the conversion into this was. Us all in a democratic country have the right to voice our personal issues. Given them power no matter if such view to harmful to the greater good or not. Is this good or is it just away to exploit the system. \n\nNot quite sure what you're saying here. Exploiting people and extracting profits from the labors of others isn't freedom of speech, why you would frame it in such a way boggles the mind. 
"The time" would be referring to a specific time, like 11:35 pm. "A time" is referring to a period of time characterized by a set of circumstances, in this case; rampant wealth and income inequality, crushing debt on the mass of people in the form of mortgages, student loans, credit cards, title loans, and the transition to a financial and services based economy that has gutted the middle class. 
>But upset of the few that gain so much power. Power within society is the crushing force that we fear. The tenant needs more power so he can stand up to a landlord.\n\nI'm not upset with the few who gained power, I'm upset with the mechanisms that allowed for power to be concentrated in such a way in the first place, as well as with the lack of internal mechanisms of democratic accountability within those concentrations of power. Socialists call a concentration of power without internal mechanisms of democratic accountability tyranny. [Noam Chomsky](https://youtu.be/FVt7U2YIgZs) talks a lot about this. \n\nTo further this conversation (which I'm thoroughly enjoying, by the way) we need to understand what power is and how it reproduces itself. \n\nPower is the control of land and the control of productive capacity. If you control land and control productive capacity you have power. So the next question is what does that power look like? In class society that power takes the form of the employer/employee relationship, the landlord/tenant relationship, and the creditor/debtor relationship. These are relationships of domination; one has power and can impose that power unilaterally, and the other doesn't, and must submit themselves to the former to maintain access to socially necessary resources required to reproduce their existence (housing, food and water, healthcare, education). This is the basis of class, and a contradiction that conflicts to produce crises. That employees, tenants, and debtors have a degree of state protection is because they organized together and fought for concessions from the ruling class, not something intrinsic to the mode of production. That there are protections though doesn't mean the contradiction has been resolved. We'll get into contradiction later. \n\n>The tenant needs more power so he can stand up to a landlord. \n\nTo go further we must understand contradiction. Capitalist society is built on what socialists call contradictions; institutions, norms, and relationships that produce conflict that emerge as crises. To better understand contradictions in the capitalist mode of production check out David Harvey's [17 Contradictions and the End of Capitalism](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bih/lcts/summer-school-2014/reading-materials-1/harvey-readings/Seventeen%20Contradictions%20FIRST%20PROOFS.pdf/at_download/file). It's an easy read, but I advise taking your time. It can be somewhat difficult if you're unfamiliar with Marxist terminology. \n\nThe basic example of contradiction in capitalist society is that of use-value and exchange-value (Harvey details this in part one, chapter one). To explain it a little bit I'll use the example Harvey uses, that of housing. Homes have many use-values (shelter from the elements, a place to keep your stuff, a place to raise your family, a private corner of the world to have sex, and so on), but they have only one exchange-value (profit). In capitalist society we don't build homes for people to live in and use to raise their families, we build homes to generate profits for a minority ruling class and organize access to that housing to reinforce and perpetuate class division (itself a contradiction). So we've come to understand that power reproduces itself by organizing access to socially necessary resources the mass of people require to reproduce their existence. Essentially, the capitalist positions themselves between the People and that which they need to survive, and charges them for privileged access. \n\nAn example of crises that emerges from the contradiction of use-value and exchange-value is the financial collapse in 2007. Starting in the 80's the various institutions of the ruling class (legislatures, banks, the media) coalesced around building homes to produce exchange-values. These exchange-values primarily took the form mortgage backed securities, with banks bundling millions of mortgages together and selling them back and forth to each other increasing profit for themselves with each exchange, which eventually produced a crises that almost brought down the global economy. That the state was able to manage this crises (to a degree), doesn't mean the underlying contradictions that produced the crises were resolved. In fact they were reinforced. \n\nSo to resolve the landlord/tenant contradiction we must dissolve the landlord/tenant relationship, with tenants owning and managing their owning living spaces through processes of consensus decision making. \n\n>Democracy works best when power is spreaded out.\n\nSo now that we know what power is and how it reproduces itself, how do we organize society such that democracy is allowed to flourish? One part of the socialist answer is to guarantee by right access to socially necessary resources the mass of people require to reproduce their existence (housing, food and water, healthcare, and education). The way to do this *is* democracy, specifically consensus democracy. But we can get into that later. \n\n>Why is selling ownership a bad thing? Are rental companies bad? What about renting tools or cars? What if laws were made to make it child's play for tenants to exploit landlords? Would you change your views on who was being exploited?\n\nOwnership isn't in and of itself "bad." What I have a problem with is absentee ownership, which I've already somewhat explained but can go into further if you'd like. \n\n>Defending and supporting your interest with ones freedom of speech can sometimes be detrimental to the society at large. So my is question is how can we not exploit others if we are given the power and right to do so?\n\nWe do that by not doing that, instead we organize together and build power around consensus decision making that sits counter to private tyranny. We can dig into what this consensus counter-power looks like if you want. 
If you require the existence poverty, homelessness, starvation, food insecurity, and death to make you feel good about your labors then the problem is with your own head, and you need to figure that shit out. You seem like a bad person. 
What are some of these titles owned by industrial groups? 
Lol
Your premise is faulty. Socialism is merely the organization of society around the free association of equal power relations engaged in consensus decision-making that flows from the abolition of conditioned access (employment, rents, debt) to socially necessary resources required for the mass of people to reproduce their existence (housing, food and water, healthcare, education). \n\nSo what would a socialist hospital in a socialist society look like? The doctors, nurses, administrative staff, maintenance staff, janitorial staff, cafeteria staff, and so on, would manage the hospital themselves through consensus decision making and collaborate with their political counter-parts to guarantee debt-free access to every man, woman, and child in the community the hospital serves. \n\nThe individual departments would determine, among other things, the pay-scale for their department, and would collaborate with the other departments to manage and maintain the operations of the hospital. 
I'm not wedded to any single precondition, and those that you suggest seem reasonable. Perhaps being a member for a defined period of time, maybe a year or so, would be necessary. I'm open to discussing more and varied suggestions. 
The process of them finding the restaurant to eat at *is* [consensus decision making](http://imgur.com/73TBjbb). It's something we all already know how to do. \n\nA government built around this would have mechanisms of facilitating the reaching of consensus, namely, the instant recall of representatives.
Best wishes, pal. Let me know what you think when you're finished. If you like it there are others you may enjoy. 
Mercantilism was just proto-capitalism, and the bourgeois class that emerged from it were able to build a base of power (control of land and productive capacity) from which to agitate against the crown for revolution. After capturing the state they reconstituted it in their own image, and established a government to direct the power of that state to manage the competing and conflicting interests of their class and protect them from democratic forces from below. 
I'll take that as the compliment I know that it is. Thoughts on the subsequent ideas? 
Are we talking about like a wooden axe or a crescent wrench? 
"Globalization" is a dog-whistle for Jews. Whether you meant it that way or not, just know you're carrying water for the alt-Reich. \n\nThe cause of the common problems facing poor and working people is capitalism, particularly the neoliberal expression of it. Therefore the solutions to the common problems facing poor and working people is in their own heads and their own hands, not in a system that produced those problems in the first place. 
I actually really enjoy Jersey Girl, it's a sweet little film. 
Socialism only requires free associations of equal power relations. \n\n>Let me in turn ask you, my friend, shall we punish the man whom nature has not endowed as generously as his stronger or more talented neighbor? Shall we add injustice to the handicap nature has put upon him? All we can reasonably expect from any man is that he do his best-can any one do more? And if John’s best is not as good as his brother Jim’s, it is his misfortune, but in no case a fault to be punished.\n\n>There is nothing more dangerous than discrimination. The moment you begin discriminating against the less capable, you establish conditions that breed dissatisfaction and resentment: you invite envy, discord, and strife. You would think it brutal to withhold from the less capable the air or water they need. Should not the same principle apply to the other wants of man? After all, the matter of food, clothing, and shelter is the smallest item in the world’s economy.\n\n>**The surest way to get one to do his best is not by discriminating against him, but by treating him on an equal footing with others. That is the most effective encouragement and stimulus. It is just and human**.\n\n>“But what will you do with the lazy man, the man who does not want to work?” inquires your friend.\n\n>That is an interesting question, and you will probably be very much surprised when I say that there is really no such thing as laziness. What we call a lazy man is generally a square man in a round hole. That is, the right man in the wrong place. And you will always find that when a fellow is in the wrong place, he will be inefficient or shiftless. For so-called laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely unfitness, misplacement. If you are compelled to do the thing you are unfitted for by your inclinations or temperament, you will be inefficient at it; if you are forced to do work you are not interested in, you will be lazy at it.\n\n>Every one who has managed affairs in which large numbers of men were employed can substantiate this. Life in prison is a particularly convincing proof of the truth of it and, after all, present-day existence for most people is but that of a larger jail. Every prison warden will tell you that inmates put to tasks for which they have no ability or interest are always lazy and subject to continuous punishment. But as soon as these “refractory convicts” are assigned to work that appeals to their leanings, they become “model men,” as the jailers term them."\n\n--Alexander Berkman

It's very difficult to find common ground with a group of people who've constructed their own reality. To be sure, this isn't all people who voted for Trump, many can be reasoned with and common ground can be found, even if they ultimately disagree with "the left," but for the most ardent and sycophantic Trump followers finding common ground is a useless endeavor. 
All revolutions, regardless of tone or timber, by nature of seeking to change the present order of things, are violent. You invoking "Marxist revolution" is either from a frame of ignorance or the signaling of a counter-worker agenda. 
This question comes up a lot, so I'll share what I wrote the last time, as well as detailing what is and isn't private or personal based on the instances the OP I was replying to established (someone's kidney, a tree, and an asteroid). \n\n>I think for the most part capitalist "ownership" norms developed and iterated upon over the past couple of hundred years is in many ways sufficient i.e. If you have something in your possession that wasn't forcefully taken from another (purchased or gifted) then it's yours, so society as a whole will protect that claim on your behalf. \n\n>Where socialist conceptions of "ownership" differs in terms of what is personal and what is (what capitalist property norms consider) private is largely dependent on use. So for example your home, the land it sits on, and all the stuff that are in it are your personal property. Land used for commodity production, the enterprises that built your home and manufactured the stuff in it, and the store where you purchased your stuff would be (what capitalist property norms consider) private property. The difference between the two being this "private" property in a socialist society would be based on relationships in free association of equal power relations and consensus decision making of those involved. \n\n>Another difference in a socialist society would be an individual or enterprise couldn't own land they're not actively using to extract from it rents from another person. \n\n>In large part, the reason why socialist conceptions of ownership varies depending on the socialist has a lot to do with socialist conceptions of ownership being the non-dominant form of ownership over the past couple of hundred years. Capitalist property relations have been constructed into a legal framework that has been iterated upon in many instances on a case-by-case basis that establish precedence that is then enforced through the varying arms of the state, and thus become social norms accepted by most people. \n\n>So your example of a kidney would be personal property because the DNA given (or gifted) to you by your parents allowed for you to grow it. So if you wanted to give one of your kidneys to another then it's up to you, provided of course that force or coercion wasn't applied to influence your decision. \n\n>Your example of an oak tree would be dependent on where it sits. Does it sit on the (modest) plot of land the house you're actively using is on? Then it's your personal property. Although your neighbors (if you have them) might take issue with you chopping it down because of the potential for it to land on their home. So your community would most likely have a framework in place to establish conditions and requirements for removing said tree. Does it sit on "unclaimed" land (what capitalist property norms would call public lands)? Then it belongs to the community that has "jurisdiction" (in the parlance of capitalist property norms) over it, and subject to the rules and norms established by that community. \n\n>In the case of an asteroid, I don't know. Capitalist property norms, as far as I'm aware, have yet to establish precedent over private ownership of non-Earth objects other then that nation-states can't claim them as sovereign territory. \n\n>That having been said, assuming a socialist state based on these conceptions of personal and "private" property, and thus ownership, was established, they would create a legal framework that would be iterated upon over time on a case-by-case basis where conflict between two or more parties arise. 
Anything by Cornel West. He's kind of the resident spiritualist of the anti-capitalist left. \n\nHis notion of [catastrophic love](https://youtu.be/3EYK4p0Byfw) I find fascinating, even though I'm not particularly religious myself. 
"Vulnerable party." Yeah, ok. 
I'm really excited to see how the whole infield matures this year, especially Baez, as he's my favorite. 
Bernie's personal life doesn't prove or disprove anything, you trying to use that as a cudgel is disingenuous and dishonest of you.  \n\nRelying on "the market" to build, maintain, and provide socially necessary resources force the mass of people into asymmetric power relations to gain access. Conditioning access in this way to these vital things we all rely on to survive empowers and enriches a tiny fraction of the population and allows them to wax fat from passive income generated through the labor of others. 
That's cool. Like I said, so long as you're approaching this with skepticism, then we're all good. In the interim I would recommend you check out the [Bread Book](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread), and work to develop your class consciousness so as to create a shield against ruling class machinations. 
You make a good point, which is why I consider short, medium, and long-term actions. In the short-term I think more people getting involved in volunteering and working at food banks and the like are important and necessary. In the medium-term, we should be using this volunteer work to raise class consciousness of the people we're serving (edit; and those we're working alongside) and connect them to leftist groups, unions and other political arms to begin building a base of support that is class conscious and focused on organizing communities together to fashion solutions to their own problems. And in the long-term, network these local organizations together to more effectively agitate for change. \n\nI think a component of this is certainly strikes, protests, and demonstrations, but we must also be working on rebuilding a working class press, and building counter-power to capitalism. This means community farming, community housing, community "employment" (for lack of a better word) that focuses on abandoning participation in the capitalist economy and creating neighborhoods and the like that are community owned and managed, and who are able to produce most of their own food, clothes, and so on. This means connecting, perhaps through crowdfunding and the like, communities to debt-free capital that allows them to purchase their own land, homes, and workplaces communally. \n\nThere are probably several things I'm not considering, so please help flesh out this idea, as well as any criticisms, ideas, or suggestions you may have. Socialism is nothing if not collaboration. 
Assuming the solution to the common problems of working people is in a system that produced those problems in the first place.

Faulty premise. \n\n>Capitalism's high priests have been generally more secular than their predecessors. Instead of churches and religions, colleges and universities comprise their institutional framework. Capitalism's high priests are likely professors, including especially the "mainstream economists." They justify and rationalize capitalism's very unequal distributions of wealth and income (and also of power and access to culture). Mainstream economics professors have mostly replicated the efforts of the earlier high priests of slavery and feudalism. **Thus the "mastery" of the slave-master and the "lordship" of the feudal lord reappear as the "entrepreneurship" that mainstream economists believe they observe as a contribution to production made exclusively by capitalists. The exclusion of workers from almost all design, initiation, directorial and management functions within capitalist production (and from learning or becoming credentialed in them) keeps fostering such observations**.\n\n>The professors use entrepreneurship to explain and justify the capitalists' great wealth and incomes relative to that of their employees. Entrepreneurship is "more productive" than the mere labor of employees. **Over time, mainstream economists and the journalists, politicians and general public they reach have also reasoned in the reverse direction. That is, they infer entrepreneurship and its productivity from their observations of the huge shares capitalists take from outputs**. Either way, mainstream economists reaffirm the desired link: capitalists' incomes and wealth are determined by their particular, unique and superior contributions to production. In mainstream economic theory, capitalists are not just ripping off their employees.\n\n[Economic Theorists: The High Priests of Capitalism](http://www.rdwolff.com/economic_theorists_the_high_priests_of_capitalism)

1) The extent of the collusion revealed by Wikileaks wasn't fully apparent until after the convention is decided, and 2) What do you expect him to do about it? Go on TV and rail about a rigged system? The same TV media whose slanted coverage was 100% backing Hillary?\n\nIt would have just ended in more accusations of him being "selfish" and refusing to "unite the party" and all the old people who know fuck all about Wikileaks would eat it up. All they had to do was run a few stories *claiming* he "went negative" and there are *still* people I know who think he was "mean and nasty" during the primary. \n\nBesides that, he has no real legal recourse against the DNC... they literally argued in court that their charter's mention of neutrality is a "political promise" and therefore not enforceable. \n\nNote: I don't "think Bernie is going to save me," but that doesn't change that he is one of the few politicians we actually have who are working for our common good. 
It seems to be a psychological side effect of our two party duopoly. I don't know what to do about it. 
>ingratiation... Clinton first term  \n\nHohoho what a freudian slip
Huxley wrote Brave New World before trying hallucinogenics, and I'm pretty sure he had a negative image of drug use prior to his trying mescaline. After The Doors of Perception he wrote The Island, Brave New World's sequel. On the titular island people used hallucinogenics in a more positive way than soma was depicted. 
Capitalism is the new feudalism, only land ownership is replaced with stocks and obscene levels of generational wealth. There's little difference between a king and a billionaire when the decisions of the latter has as much of an impact on the lives of the common men as those of the former. \n\nAside from that, I'm not sure what else you'd call it, since it's certainly not socialist for the enforcers of a capitalist nation to overthrow a socialist one to protect the profits of a corporation beloning to the former. And were the U.S. not to have intervened at all, if there were some hypothetical situation where government did not exist, there is nothing stopping IT&T from hiring mercenaries to solidify their control of Chile if they are powerful enough to control the nation's economy already.\n\nAlso I would like to point out that, you know how everybody blames every single death under Stalin/Mao/Pol Pot et al on communism, because their horrific actions were ostensibly done in communism's name? Well, the same logic can be applied to these coups, since they were carried out in the name of capitalism (even if you were to argue that it's "not real capitalism").
1) Revealing information about secret collusion within our ruling class is the opposite of "anti-Democratic," unless you meant anti-Democratic ***Party***.\n\n2) This is literally just your first point, repeated, asserting that he's a stooge with nothing to back it up.\n\n3) This is the exact same logic behind the media having "both sides" represented no matter what. I hope you realize that you share this in common with climate change deniers who think the media is biased if they don't air equal amount of time to "skeptics"\n\n4) So fucking what? There is plenty of reason to hate the US government, and there is absolutely reason to extend this hatred beyond simply "The Republicans." Democrats and Republicans both operate to serve the oligarchy, you stupid fuck. \n\n5) Comey "handed the election to Trump" about as much as "Russia hacked the election," which is not at all. Hillary lost because she pivoted to the right and alienated Sanders supporters and progressives who, unlike you, actually understand the corruption revealed by Wikileaks.\n\n6) Where have I said fucking ***anything at all*** about Trump/Russia or "the intelligence community fabricating information"? Hint: I didn't. I totally believe that there are ties between Russia and Trump. I am denying ties between Russia and ***Wikileaks***. \n\n7) I don't fucking know, but again, acting like Assange is some hypocrite over not willingly entering a prison cell has fuck all to do with what I said about the trustworthiness of the fucking CIA. Jesus fucking Christ. \n\n>I dislike Clinton and Trump pretty equally, but that doesn't mean I have to trust some 2-bit clown like Assange at his word. It's just sad that Wikileaks apparently is his propaganda machine, and not the release organ of hacked info it once was. \n\n8) If you actually do hate both "pretty equally" as you claim, you are one stupid motherfucker for believing this simply because Wikileaks has not *yet* released anything on his administration when he literally took office a month ago. \n\nFurthermore, ***unlike Hillary*** we can actually rely on the media to alert us to Trump's misdeeds. We don't ***need*** Wikileaks to know that Trump is fucking corrupt. Jesus fuck. What do you even think Wikileaks could ever release that would destroy Trump's support? He's already reneged on pretty much all of his campaign promises except for all the racist shit. He's literally said that he doesn't care about draining the swamp anymore. He says and does abhorrent things literally all the time! And it actually gets reported on!\n\nIt's not like CNN/MSNBC/ABC et al where they actively hide, downplay, or spin events to benefit the neoliberal/neoconservative establishment. 
Oliver Stone's documentary The Untold History of the United States was where I learned about IT&T's involvement and Allende's desire to nationalize them. [Here's the Wiki article on the Chilean coup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27état), but I'm not sure if it mentions the IT&T stuff since I'm at work and can't really read the whole thing at the moment. \n\n[Here's the wiki article on the 1954 Guatemalan coup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d'état). \n\nOh and how could I forget the CIA backed 1953 Iranian coup which is directly to blame for the rise of religious authoritarianism there. [Here's the wiki on that, although in this case the British are more to blame, but we supported their efforts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27état).\n\nThese are just the coups I'm somewhat familiar with off the top of my head, but I know there are more. Anywhere a leftist government has threatened US profits, the CIA has either overthrown them or tried.
>what exactly was revealed?  \n\nThat the investigation was a fucking farce? Every major player who could have been charged with anything was given immunity, seemingly for no reason whatsoever. Combetta was outed as being /u/StoneTear and was found to have solicited advice on modifying emails on an exchange server, and subsequently went and deleted everything (on his Reddit account) as knowledge of this came out. That alone is enough to void his immunity, but woops, he's still walking free despite acknowledging he knew of the preservation orders for Hillary's emails yet deleted them anyway. \n\nCoincidentally he did so after a conference call with Heather Samuelson and Cheryl Mills, the contents of which are unknown because they're all citing attorney-client privilege (saying that the call was about Hillary and that Combetta was just "servicing" it as their IT guy). Both of whom were also given immunity in exchange for the contents of their laptops, which the FBI could have very easily subpoenaed and seized. \n\nMills's story to the FBI is that she had no idea that the server even existed until news of it became public... but there's an email she sent to Cooper where she literally says "HRC email getting bounced back, is the server okay?" to which he responded "Silly, we're on the same server." When asked in testimony before Congress how this did not constitute evidence that she did, in fact, know of the server and therefore lied to the FBI, James Comey answered that he did not recall. \n\nAnd then there's, you know, the fact that Comey made up the requirement for mens rea to prosecute for espionage, and on top of that Hillary's numerous false exculpatory statements which were shown time and again to be lies (I only used two devices! It was for convenience! Nothing was classified, nothing was *marked* classified!) can be used to fucking impute mens rea.\n\nThat's just off the top of my head and only about 5% of the fucking bullshit that came out of this investigation. And before you start, I already think Trump should be in prison so don't fucking accuse me of partisanship. Only partisan hacks think that their side's shit doesn't stink, and that includes Democrats and Republicans. 
I'm pretty sure the mods of all the socialist/communist/etc subs are compromised in an effort to discredit their respective ideologies. These are the same people who take "inclusiveness" to such a hyperbolic extreme that they've auto-modded away a huge list of words that they (the unelected, unaccountable mods) have deemed "ableist hate speech." You can't say crazy, insane, obese, ***nuts***, or any of a number of other incredibly common words. You can't say idiot. What's ironic, though, is that the stupid fucking blog post that they link to explain ableism says that "fat" and "ignoramus" are perfectly acceptable, despite having the same fucking negative (and ableist, in the case of the latter) connotations!\n\nThe worst part is that the bot obviously does not parse for context, so if you have a 10000 word post on how capitalism sucks but you use the word nuts one time (even "I had some mixed nuts as a snack") the whole thing gets removed instantly. Complaining to the mods yields holier-than-thou "fuck you" responses. I've been told that I "really really want to disparage the differently abled" when trying to convey to these fucking cocksucks that there are better ways to deal with hate speech than to ban fucking words. For mods of a sub devoted to an ideology centered around bringing democracy to the workplace, it's ironic that their policies are so opaque and devoid of democratic input. 
not cool
>The point of posts like these are to keep everyone aware of the fact that we need to wipe the Democratic party clean of every politician who takes money from corporations, every politician who refuses to be transparent, and every politician who lied through their fucking teeth during the election to help Hillary.  \n\nToo many witless rubes unintentionally shill for the establishment by trying to equate this with infighting. "Oh but we need to unite, we need these moderate democrats!" when nobody is talking about left or moderate or conservative, we're talking about removing from the party those beholden to corporate interests because they are beholden to their donors and not the electorate. We cannot continue to straddle the ideals of progressivism and corporate neoliberalism and naively continue acting as though both can coexist when one actively operates to sabotage the other. \n\nPeople keep fucking crying about "purity tests," but it's a really simple question. Do you want elected representatives who will vote with corporate concerns, for example *against single payer healthcare*, or do you want elected representatives who will represent the people. You can't have both, and we shouldn't have to suffer under the former in any capacity, no matter how foolishly you believe those Democrats will "help" us against the Republicans. 
They're not *government* propaganda, they're *corporate* propaganda. But tell me, what's the difference when those same corporations, through campaign contributions and lobbyist influence, effectively dictate our legislation and governance? \n\nWe're living in an oligarchy, and Trump *isn't the only oligarch*. 
Ughhhhhh if you think Trump is on our side, you are almost certainly incorrect. There is potential for good from his presidency purely from the destabilization caused by fighting between his faction of the oligarchy and the establishment, but there is no reason to believe that if he manages to consolidates power that the new establishment would be any better than the old one. He's still a fucking oligarch.\n\n[You might want to read this and see if there are any parallels in the movements which brought Hitler and Mussolini to power and the "alt-right" today](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm).\n\n>At the moment that the "normal" police and military resources of the bourgeois dictatorship, together with their parliamentary screens, no longer suffice to hold society in a state of equilibrium -- the turn of the fascist regime arrives. Through the fascist agency, capitalism sets in motion the masses of the crazed petty bourgeoisie and the bands of declassed and demoralized lumpenproletariat -- all the countless human beings whom finance capital itself has brought to desperation and frenzy.\n\n>From fascism the bourgeoisie demands a thorough job; once it has resorted to methods of civil war, it insists on having peace for a period of years. And the fascist agency, by utilizing the petty bourgeoisie as a battering ram, by overwhelming all obstacles in its path, does a thorough job. After fascism is victorious, finance capital directly and immediately gathers into its hands, as in a vise of steel, all the organs and institutions of sovereignty, the executive administrative, and educational powers of the state: the entire state apparatus together with the army, the municipalities, the universities, the schools, the press, the trade unions, and the co-operatives. When a state turns fascist, it does not mean only that the forms and methods of government are changed in accordance the patterns set by Mussolini -- the changes in this sphere ultimately play a minor role -- but it means first of all for the most part that the workers' organizations are annihilated; that the proletariat is reduced to an amorphous state; and that a system of administration is created which penetrates deeply into the masses and which serves to frustrate the independent crystallization of the proletariat. Therein precisely is the gist of fascism....  \n\nSo once again as capitalism fails an authoritarian leader rises, distracts reactionary working class members with calls to returning to greatness, blaming a foreign "Other" for our problems, and directs his supporters in resistance to *a faction within the oligarchy* but *not the oligarchy itself*. No workers are being united, except Under Trump and Against Trump's Enemies. His cabinet is full of literal white supremacists, privatization warriors, and other members of his class. Maybe I'll be wrong, but I seriously doubt it, and regardless you should still look at historical parallels to similar societies rather than tell yourself "No, no, he's totally on our side," especially when he lies literally as much as Hillary does. 
My prediction: literally no matter what happens, Perez will win. It doesn't matter how much we donate or how many calls are made, power will not be yielded to the people.

So people only have value if they are capable of procreation. Better kill all sterile people then, they're just a drain on society! Better wipe out the infirm and mentally ill as well, because on a "survival of mankind basis" they are almost worthless.\n\n>Why do you wish to decay the morals of entire nations that have been standing for decades or longer, over identity politics that affect less than 1% of people?  \n\nLiterally the same logic used by ISIS and other right wing extremists.

Yeah, like fomenting right wing rebellion in Chile (even going as far to green light assassination plans for a general who vowed to defend democracy to the death) because Allende wanted to nationalize IT&T, which had a stranglehold on the national economy. Fun fact, it is in fact the same IT&T behind the ITT Technical Institute...\n\nI don't understand how anybody can think we're the good guys or that socialism is bad when we've gone around installing dozens of brutal right wing dictatorships just so American companies can make a buck
Ding ding ding, that's why corporate media hosted the debate in the first place. 
>I'm non religious and I don't support divisive bigotry.  \n\nOh, then you're just an idiot supporting extremist ideology for nothing.\n\n>I also don't support quack science or feminist mothers telling their kid they are gay when they are five years old or saying it's okay to play with barbie dolls.  \n\nI never said I find it acceptable to "tell their kid they are gay" or begin intersex therapy at fucking 5 years old. I am arguing that adult transgendered people are human and deserve compassion rather than fear that they'll "whip out their dong" on you, as if something about identifying as trans somehow makes someone a flasher/pervert/rapist.  \n\n>I don't believe in religion, so I ultimately don't care if gay people get married. The same as how I don't care about anything else they do, since only a pathetic loser would base their identity on their sexuality.  \n\nThen why don't you just fucking acknowledge that they have that right, instead of derisively saying "LGBT 'RIGHTS'" like they don't deserve them? Jesus fuck. \n\n>Do you know what I do believe in though? Pedophiles, sexual deviants, and people who scam the system.  \n\nThis is why I am calling you a bigot, you are referring to LGBT persons like this and you are literally lumping them in with pedophiles. Hint: that is bigotry, that is transphobia\n\n>Let me guess, the transgender community is nothing but a bunch of innocent law abiding victims and disproportionately they commit less sex crimes than non-transgender people right!???  \n\nWhat a fucking stupid statement, I don't even know how to respond to this. No, I'm not saying "every trans person is innocent of every crime," I'm saying that you are a bigoted assfuck for insinuating that they are more predisposed to crime and will whip out their dong and rape you if they're allowed into "the wrong bathroom."\n\n>CAIS individuals are allowed to poop in the gender specific bathroom that matches their fucking genitals.  \n\nYou said there are two genders. CAIS individuals are biologically XY, but have female genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics. \n\nSo you're saying these biologically male individuals can poop in the ladies' room because they have vaginas. But trans-women with vaginas can't be extended the same right, because it makes you uncomfortable? What if the CAIS person decided that they wanted to be male after all and they undergo intersex surgery to acquire a penis... do they still poop in the ladies' room? Please, elucidate for me where your non-religious super important morals dictate they poop in this instance, and how it differs in any way from other trans-women. \n\nP.s. the point of this is that you consider CAIS to be different because "it's a disorder," so to you receiving a penis is "correcting" that disorder, but introduces literally the same problem as any other female-to-male trans person would face. \n\nedit:\n\n>I have no problem with a gay man using the same washroom as me, I have a problem with a woman using it and mostly because of the vice versa, men who can easily abuse this to be predators toward women.  \n\nWhy would someone wait until it's legal to enter a restroom by claiming to identify as female only to then commit an illegal act and rape them in it? This argument is ridiculous, like, what the fuck. Like who the fuck is going to think to themselves "Wow, you know, I really want to rape that woman who just entered the restroom, but the sign says "Women" so I can't go in!" -_-
> CNN ops,  \n\nI'm pretty sure he's using CNN when he means "the media in general," [here's Carl Bernstein (Watergate reporter)](http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php) on the matter. \n\n>syndicate \n\nWhat else do you call it but a cabal when you have a group of politicians beholden to corporate interests, the vast majority of media outlets in the country are owned by those same interests, and all three groups work intimately together to further their own power? There's a reason there was a media blackout on Bernie, bro.\n\n>I know that Clinton/podesta are pretty horrid but what you replied really sounds like contrived /r/t_d propaganda.  \n\nI agree about the guy you're responding to, by the way, so it's not all crazy T_D people who believe this.

I got banned for angrily challenging this bullshit for the 4th or 5th time because I could no longer resist telling the cocksuck mods to go fuck themselves. A long message on  how they are literally taking it upon themselves without any democratic input to both define and prosecute thoughtcrime and I get responses like "WOW YOU REALLY REALLY REALLY WANT TO DISPARAGE THE MENTALLY ILL!" \n\nNo, I just don't think a fucking ***bot*** should exist to censor a list of words a cadre of elites thought up in their free time without any regards to context or content of the post. \n\n"Nuts" is ableist hate speech apparently, so now posts that contain phrases such as "nuts are a good source of protein" get instantly removed. What the fucking fuck? \n\nNot to mention the horribly inconsistent logic applied in making this list. \n\nObese = bad, fat = okay? \n\nIdiot = horrible ableist hate speech, yet ignoramus is somehow okay despite having the same fucking connotations? Ignorant is somehow okay despite being a word rooted in educational/economic privilege? \n\nThe worst is the fucking asshole mods acting like I'm devoted to fucking bigotry when I'm simply sick and tired of having long posts ***criticizing capitalism*** removed without warning because I included a word somewhere that is on their asinine naughty list.\n\nThe problem is these lazy fucking mods want to ban hate speech and they think banning speech itself is a good enough substitute when in reality it makes them come off as petty dictators taking censorship to a hyperbolic extreme. 
It matters because, to quote Roosevelt ([excerpts of his letter to the 1940 DNC, wherein he threatened to relinquish the nomination if corrupt party bosses colluded to block his VP pick of progressive Henry Wallace (whom they would successfully replace with Truman in '45](http://www.opednews.com/articles/Franklin-D-Roosevelt-Lett-by-Michael-Moore-121112-817.html)):\n\n>the Democratic Party has received the support of the electorate only when the party, with absolute clarity, has been the champion of progressive and liberal policies and principles of government.\n\n>The party has failed consistently when through political trading and chicanery it has fallen into the control of those interests, personal and financial, which think in terms of dollars instead of in terms of human values.  \n\n>Until the Democratic Party through this convention makes overwhelmingly clear its stand in favor of social progress and liberalism, and shakes off all the shackles of control fastened upon it by the forces of conservatism, reaction, and appeasement, it will not continue its march of victory.\n\n"Bernie would have won" matters because the intimate collusion between the DNC, media, and Hillary campaign make it clear that the party believes it can achieve victory *without* making such a stand against the wealthy and conservative elements which have infected it. Their actions *since* the election are a clarion call that the establishment wishes to continue business as usual. 
I'm saying that the circumstances are incredibly suspicious and it is very likely that Guccifer 2.0 isn't real and existed for the sole purpose of driving the entire Russian Hacker narrative and discrediting Wikileaks in doing so.\n\nA nameless nobody shows up out of nowhere purporting to have real dirt on the Democrats just after Wikileaks announces its upcoming releases. They release their dirt, which ends up having nothing at all of value in it, but which has Russian language traces in it and quotes by the founder of the FSB and evidence of use of a Russian IP. When pressed on being Romanian they couldn't speak the language. \n\nI'd like to point out\n\n1) This evidence of Russian involvement with 2ccifer is far from conclusive, but nevertheless is the sole basis by which the media has sought to link Wikileaks to Russia despite their being unaffiliated with him\n\n2) The evidence is so, so, so sloppy that it beggars belief that we are expected to believe it could come from the same GRU which is apparently so professional and good at their jobs that Russia poses an existential threat to us\n\n3) You'd think the super duper ~~Soviet~~ Russian Intelligence would have access to at least *one* fluent Romanian speaker who could aid the appearance of 2ccifer being Romanian\n\n4) ***If*** Wikileaks is a Russian front as the media has been wont to portray them as, then it makes 0 sense for Russia to establish *another* front with 0 credibility run through a fucking Wordpress blog, especially when that second front ends up doing nothing but resulting in the questioning of the other, more reputable one. \n\nIf you're not suspicious of all this when the media spent a month and a half blaring on all frequencies that Wikileaks is a Russian pawn when the only evidence of Russian involvement links to 2ccifer, which again isn't very strong evidence in itself, then I don't know what to tell you. \n\nOn top of that, James Clapper (Director of National Intelligence, literally oversees all of our intelligence gathering) testified before congress on Nov. 17th that the evidence linking Wikileaks to Russia is "not strong" and that they do not have clear insight as to how the data was obtained. That didn't stop the media from saying otherwise, and people STILL bring up the "17 agencies said!" bit apparently unaware of how Clapper's own testimony contradicts it (coming over a month after the report). 
Motherfucker are you really going to go on about how dumb Republicans are when that's all you have to say in response to things that fucking happened? Go ahead and believe your fucking alternative facts. Comey is a Republican so therefore none of the suspicious circumstances I delineated happened, yup. It's not like he invented the requirement for mens rea to prosecute while simultaneously ignoring Hillary's numerous false exculpatory statements to the media (you know, all of her excuses which were one by one proven to be lies?) which is sufficient to impute mens rea. Oh wait, that happened too. It's not like he was asked under oath why Mills emailing Cooper "HRC email getting bounced back, server okay?" wasn't sufficient evidence that she knew of the server to begin with, only to have him answer "I do not recall."\n\nYup Comey is a Republican and therefore he was just out to get her and none of these factual occurrences happened, yup! Jesus fucking christ.\n\nInstead of "well you're not the fbi therefore you know nothing" maybe you should accept that there are people who paid more attention to this than you because they actually fucking cared about the truth. 
Then please fucking elucidate your point with some examples you gibbering pile of human fucking garbage. Jesus fucking christ. Don't fucking call me daft when all ***you've*** done is go in circles saying "You're wrong, they're not *all* bad!" without giving a single fucking statement to support that. Which agencies in particular, and why the fuck do they matter more than the NSA/CIA/FBI, which collectively perform the bulk of both domestic and international intelligence activities? Are you going to tell me I'm wrong because the Coast Guard is good? Way to miss the forest for the trees, you stupid fucker.

Indeed. He probably would have honored agreements made with the Soviets rather than rush the bomb and use it as nuclear blackmail (setting the stage for numerous future presidents to do the same), which may have prevented the nuclear arms race altogether, or at least mitigated the extreme scale of potential destruction as well as of the development of the military-industrial complex. Maybe with an executive leadership willing to extend an olive branch to the Communists rather than engage in half a century of proxy-warfare the Soviet Union might not have become so despotic. Who knows.

Because gay marriage totally disrupts anyone's life. Oh, wait, it doesn't- it just pisses off the Christian right who ironically want to implement their own version of Sharia as they decry human rights violations in other countries. \n\nBecause you definitely ask people "hey what gender are you bro" when they're shitting in the stall next to you, and it definitely matters if they were born with a dick or acquired one. Oh, wait, you don't do that, and it doesn't. \n\nIt seems like reactionaries are afraid of "intellectualizing" in general. 
I agree mostly, but honestly there are a lot of parallels between Trump's election and Hitler's. Similar rhetoric, similar socioeconomic forces involved, etc. I am not basing this statement on anything the mainstream media has said, but rather my reading of history. I'm not saying he is literally Hitler, though, so please don't take me the wrong way. There is just a lot of cause to worry. \n\nBut yeah, it's ridiculous how willing people are to forget the incredible media bias we witnessed last year, how willing they are to forget previous CIA involvement with the media, how uncritical people are being of who owns what media, etc. It's fucking nuts. People are willing to fill their noses with Democrat shit and claim it smells like roses as long as they're more terrified of the alternative.
You can't fight moneyed interests while serving moneyed interests. Working for corporate America while proclaiming to serve the working class will only mean that the party will sell out the working class. Here's HARDCORE LEFTIST FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT on the matter:\n\n>***The party has failed consistently when through political trading and chicanery it has fallen into the control of those interests, personal and financial, which think in terms of dollars instead of in terms of human values.***\n\n>The Republican Party has made its nominations this year at the dictation of those who, we all know, always place money ahead of human progress.\n\n>The Democratic Convention, as appears clear from the events of today, is divided on this fundamental issue. ***Until the Democratic Party through this convention makes overwhelmingly clear its stand in favor of social progress and liberalism, and shakes off all the shackles of control fastened upon it by the forces of conservatism, reaction, and appeasement, it will not continue its march of victory.***\n\n>It is without question that certain political influences pledged to reaction in domestic affairs and to appeasement in foreign affairs have been busily engaged behind the scenes in the promotion of discord since this Convention convened.\n\n>Under these circumstances, I cannot, in all honor, and will not, merely for political expediency, go along with the cheap bargaining and political maneuvering which have brought about party dissension in this convention.\n\n>***It is best not to straddle ideals.***\n\n>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, July 18, 1940
Why the fuck anybody would ever in a million years see our intelligence community as "the good guys" is beyond me. The NSA are literally spying on the entire fucking world, or at least as much of it they can intrude upon. The CIA has overthrown democratically elected governments almost constantly since its inception. \n\nThey fomented civil unrest in Chile and supported far right wing guerrillas. Why? To save democracy? No, because socialist president Allende wanted to nationalize IT&T (fun fact: yes, they did establish ITT Technical Institute) because they controlled the majority of the nation's resources. They literally okayed the assassination of a general because he vowed to defend democracy and the constitution to the death. The end result was the establishment of the Pinochet regime and death and fear for hundreds of thousands of Chileans. All so IT&T's profits would be protected. \n\nSame with Guatemala, popular left wing government overthrown because they threatened the profits of United Fruit. Again and again and again the CIA has consistently acted as enforcers for the bourgeois establishment, for capitalism, no matter the cost in lives or how much suffering they have enabled. 
Depending on who's looking at it, apparently. Clintonites argued election theft in favor of Trump based on the same discrepancies seen favoring Hillary in the primary... but there's no WAY it coulda been stolen from Sanders.
Since you deleted your other comment, I'm responding here:\n\n(Note, this is in response to you acting like LGBT rights only extends to bathroom laws...) You're the one who derisively said "LGBT 'rights'" as though they are not, in fact, deserving of human rights. Now you're getting all obsessed about bathroom bill type shit, because building strawmen is apparently the extent of your argumentative faculties. \n\n>What does gay marriage have to do with taking your dick out in front of a bunch of women because you "identify" as the same gender as them\n\nSince you're apparently afraid of "over"-intellectualizing, let me confront you with your greatest fear and ask you to think about the following scenario: what if it's possible for trans-women to have their penises removed in some sort of magical operation known as "intersex surgery?" What if these people are completely indistinguishable physically from biologically XX women? Since you're obsessed with dicks, this seems to not have crossed your mind.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on hormonal disorders such as Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome? Or have you never, ever heard of such a thing? Just in case, let me clue you in. Some people are born biologically XY male, but have such incredible resistance to androgens (You know, testosterone, among others) that, to their cells, it is as if none were in their system.\n\nSince their bodies cannot detect these hormones, they develop physically as females, with a vagina and everything- the only difference being lack of a uterus and internal testes. Furthermore, since their bodies experience a "lack of testosterone," they produce *more and more of it*, and it ends up being converted into *estrogen* via the enzyme aromatase. Thus, individuals with CAIS typically develop *hyperfeminine characteristics*. \n\nI'm sure it's more easy to detect early on now, thanks to advances in science, but typically it's not noticed until puberty when the individual fails to begin menstruation. It is fully possible to be raised female, grow up female, and think you're female- right up until you find out that you are biologically XY.\n\nPlease tell me, what bathrooms should these people use? Male? They're biologically XY, just like all these trans-women you seem to be fucking ***terrified*** of, so I guess they have to use the male restroom. Except they are female for all intents and purposes, potentially not even being *aware* that they are biologically XY. \n\nI'm assuming you're going to come back with some idiotic "that's different! They didn't *choose* to be like that!" without even realizing that trans-people don't fucking choose to feel gender dysmorphia either.
Dumbfucks can't be fucked to understand that there can be more than one enemy to hate at a time. "Why are you talking about Hillary she lost!" or comments like his. I guess they lack either the awareness or the attention span to realize that we are opposed by both the far right as well as center right corporatists masquerading as progressives. 
>it was the fact that he didn't have broad appeal outside of his white, liberal, young demo  \n\nWhat's it like living in a fantasy-world where media coverage wasn't almost exclusively pushing the "Sanders supporters are all white, young, male college students" and similar messages? Where numerous articles tried to downplay his history of struggle fighting for civil rights? \n\nAnd where it literally doesn't matter that these same media outlets were outed for working intimately with the Hillary campaign and the DNC itself?\n\nI seriously don't know what the fuck is wrong with you and people like you where you are incapable of cross-referencing events and constructing context for things. Example:\n\n>these inconsistencies really don't change the fact that Sanders lost by a pretty wide margin (a larger margin than in 2008 for sure)  \n\nDude, I just fucking said that small things add up. How do you not get that? That these small things add up, over the course of the primary, to form that eventual large margin? How do you not understand that the end result does not justify the means taken to achieve it? That the "3 MILLION MORE VOTES!" talking point does not negate months of ridiculously dismissive and critical coverage of Bernie, of these outlets working directly with the fucking DNC on messaging? That maybe the consistent messaging I am talking about might have a little bit to do with him convincing minorities, which you seem to think is all that matters seemingly oblivious to the reality of what working against the media means.\n\nHere's a hint: working against the media means being crucified for nothing. Remember how Bernie was a horrible sexist because he said he wanted both sides to "stop shouting about gun control"? Maybe you don't. I remember at least three news cycles trying to make him out to be a misogynist, with Hillary saying things like "When a woman gets assertive, maybe some men think we're shouting."  \n\nHow many news cycles were devoted on Hillary's dismissal of a young black protester who paid to enter a posh fundraiser, demanding Hillary address Black Lives Matter? Oh, wait, none, if you didn't read about it on the internet *you didn't know it happened*. This was the ***day before the SC primary***, and there was literally booing, ***hissing from the crowd***, and some guy calling her a trespasser (again, she paid $500 to enter). As she was exiting Hillary literally said "Now let's get back ***to the real issues***."\n\nIf you tell me with a straight face that that would not have been THE END if it had happened to Bernie, if it wouldn't have been played nonstop on MSNBC/CNN/CBS/ABC et al, then you are a fucking liar, a deluded fool, or both. \n\nI'm not going to continue to respond to you after this, I've already downvoted you 30+ times over the course of the past year, and I already know that you are going to toe the establishment line no matter what. 
If only we could, like, fight both the corporate establishment *and* the wave of reactionaries. Too bad we apparently have to choose an evil to side with, since we don't have the attention span to devote to fighting conservatism on more than one front. 
But remember guys trust everything they're insinuating-without-evidence about Wikileaks being a Russian front, it is not at all suspicious that they don't allow unscripted content regarding Wikileaks to air. They're just journalists reporting the facts, yo!
Oh damn. Yeah. Id watch that
>You are dead wrong about the "MY GUY" v "YOUR GUY" thing.  \n\nI'm not sure how you are getting that I am dead wrong about it when we are saying essentially the same thing, only I don't think that the term "existentialism" really applies here and the Two Party Sports Team Effect didn't really contribute to the rise of Nazi Germany. But yeah, my use of "MY GUY" v "YOUR GUY" is the same as your mentioning pointing to an ethereal "THEM" who are responsible for all evil. Those who toe the establishment line, Republican *or* Democrat, hypocritically overlook their own parties' flaws even as they attack the opposing side for similar misdeeds. \n\nI recommend reading [Marxist explanations](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm) for the rise of fascism, as I think they explain very well the sociological and economic forces at play and their observations ring strikingly true today of Trump and the alt-right.
Why the fuck do you need Wikileaks for "leaks on trump and corruption"? Go to /r/politics and enjoy dozens of flagrant displays of corruption, daily. The day Wikileaks has secret information about Trump ***that other outlets won't publish*** is the day you'll get your Trump leak.  \n\nAnd to add, the reason any rational thinker is still "so concerned with hillary and the DNC" is because 2016 is merely yet another example of corporate interests within the DNC strangling a progressive movement in the crib. Corporate neoliberals are going to continue to sabotage progressives until people like you get it through your skulls that they are not on the side of the working class. 
1) it's laughable and also incredibly depressing that you believe leaking true information revealing how farcical our primary system is is even remotely comparable to the CIA consistently demolishing left wing governments in favor of brutal right wing dictatorships. Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n2) Wikileaks isn't "against leaks" impacting Trump, that's your own bias asserting that. \n\n3) The only sort-of positive thing Assange has *ever* said about a Trump presidency is that there is the potential for change, ***good and bad***, as a result of the chaos and unrest his presidency will bring. \n\n4) People like you who assume "Against MY GUY" means one is "for the OTHER GUY" are directly responsible for the dumbing down of American politics and the increase in partisanship. I guess that's not your fault, since it's a psychological side effect of our two party duopoly, but fuck. Grow a brain and you might understand that what is actually going on is infighting between two factions of the oligarchy, not fucking good vs evil. I wish you people would be capable of admitting the corruption of the Democratic party ***while still fighting the reactionaries on the right***, but I guess it's too much for you to hate two people at once. \n\n5) There is and has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Wikileaks's releases to Russia, no matter how many thousands of articles you've read insinuating that. The only evidence publicly released regarding any election leaks relates exclusively to Guccifer 2.0, who is completely unaffiliated with Wikileaks- and even then the evidence is *far* from conclusive. A Russian IP? Russian languages and references to the FSB? Stop the presses, because VPNs definitely aren't a thing\n\n5.b.) As a side note, part of the "proof" against 2ccifer is that he couldn't speak Romanian. You'd think the super duper Russian spymachine that is apparently out matching ours would have been able to supply at least one Romanian speaking agent. \n\n5.c.) Additionally, it makes *no sense whatsoever* for Russia to use Wikileaks as a front for leaks only to utilize a second front with no credibility at all, run through a Wordpress blog, and on top of that ***2ccifer never released anything of value*** while somehow managing to include all of those bread crumbs linking him to Russia.\n\nAnd lastly, your response is literally a deflection by whataboutism. You don't like Assange, that's cool, you're free to be misinformed if you want. But the history of the CIA acting as global police for the bourgeois is *fact*. Assange has nothing to do with the coups I've mentioned.  
>Well the fact that you veered a discussion about Trump and the IC into almost entirely a rant against Hillary shows you have some pretty clear bias.  \n\nYeah, hating both of them is totally biased, whatever dude. And I totally "veered into" this, and definitely didn't respond to shit ***you said*** that is factually inaccurate. \n\n>Umm.. no?\n>Who screamed for the previous Secretary of State's head, Colin Powell, when he was using a private email server? Or Condoleeza Rice? In fact, no secretary of state before Clinton had ever used a .gov address exclusively .\n>The entire "scandal" seems pretty laughable to me. The biggest concern the FBI had was that it was insecure. Guess what? ALL of the state dept's emails were hacked during her tenure, and the FBI openly admitted that. During the same time, NONE of her emails were hacked. So... how big a deal is it really? Republican or Democrat, I honestly really don't care about this made up scandal. And if you do care, you better go after Colin Powell too.... \n\nYou stupid fucker, I am saying that if the situation were literally 100% transposed, with Melania Trump meeting the attorney general and attempting to do so *in secret*, with the FBI giving out immunity like candy and being *unable to explain why* when questioned under oath, all of it, if that were the scenario he would be crucified for it. I'm all for investigating and prosecuting Powell if he broke the law. ***I would fucking love for officials to be held accountable***, and nothing I've said contradicts that. However, Powell didn't host a secret server in his fucking basement administered by an IT "professional" whose idea of protecting it from a hack in progress is to turn it off and back on. He didn't run for President and then spend his entire campaign provably *lying about it*.\n\nI don't know where the fuck you are getting "Hillary Clinton is the only person to ever commit a crime!" from anything that I've said. All I've done is lay out factual information that I know happened from following developments on this *daily* for two fucking years because I ***desperately*** hoped she would be forced to drop out and we could have Bernie, an actual trustworthy candidate who I can at least reliably know won't sell us out to the highest fucking bidder.\n\nNote how I'm not saying "WOWEE I'M GLAD TRUMP WON HE DEFINITELY WON'T LOOT OUR NATION YEEHAW!"?\n\n>Dude.. there is no "increasingly-fast collapse of capitalism". Thats like, if we're talking about the air conditioner and you claim the A/C leak is part of a vast global hurricane... Wow.  \n\nOkay then, the student loan bubble definitely isn't real, the vast majority of income gains since the end of the recession *haven't* gone to the top 1%, healthcare is affordable and people are making living wages. Oh... what's that? Things aren't like that, and are steadily getting worse and worse, and our viable political options are a party that wishes to stay the course of neoliberalism and another party of troglodytes who wish to burn it all down? Wow, that sounds like the collapse of an inherently unstable system to me!\n\n>And... no. WTF did wikileak ever "reveal" that wasn't boring, obvious bullshit? Are they even relevant at anything anymore?  \n\nLet's see, just off the top of my head: \n\nEnough bias at the DNC and enough officials working directly with the Clinton campaign on messaging and anti-Bernie narratives to force the resignation of ***five*** people, including the chair. Note: The DNC isn't even fucking claiming neutrality anymore! They have been sued by Sanders supporters, and they have literally made the following legal defenses in court: that they "knew" that the primary was biased, based on social media posts from the plaintiffs, and that "neutrality" is a "political promise" and therefore unenforceable in court. That doesn't sound like "We were definitely neutral, and we can reasonably argue it" to me.\n\nThen there's the intimate collusion between the Clinton campaign and the vast majority of non-News Corp affiliated media, the off-the-record dinner parties where reporters dined at Podestas and discussed talking points, the numerous emails with various reporters where they run attack stories by their handlers, etc. I'm assuming you're going to give me a canned talking point about how normal it is for journalists to slavishly toe the party line, and if so you are fucking retarded, end of story. \n\nThen there's the intimate collusion between the Clinton campaign and ***all*** of her SuperPACs, to the point where it's nearly impossible to tell where her campaign ended and the latter began. Which is, you know, actually illegal on top of being incredibly unethical, but the FEC will never do anything about it.\n\nYeah, totally nothing.\n\nFURTHERMORE, I would like for you to illustrate to me exactly how Russia "hacked the election" for Hillary if the associated corollary is *not* that they "provided emails to Wikileaks." What did they actually do, then? Hmm? What justifies the sanctions that were placed on Russia? Oh... nothing...?\n\n\nPeople like you truly disgust me, because you are getting butthurt and calling me biased because I am enumerating factual information as to why "YOUR GUY" sucks. That doesn't mean I support the other guy, you dumb motherfucker. Ever think maybe you're the one who's biased, given that you seem incapable of admitting Hillary's shit stinks? I literally referred to Trump as "the worst of the oligarchs" and that his rise disturbingly mirrors Hitler's, whereas you cannot seem to abide a single harsh word directed towards your Hilldawg. \n
They all seem so amazing in trailers and before/at release but then they all turn out to be clones or never get updated or the developers waste $70 million on a new office and then charge you for DLC. Survival games are a genre with so much potential for exciting innovation, but which commercially are filled with the laziest implementation imaginable. Demand is still high though, because people have fun with them.\n\nPersonally, I think Conan Exiles looks great, but it also looks like it's literally a texture pack for Ark, so...
Not really in and of itself, but if you get yourself a sizable following, absolutely. They don't teach you in school that when MLK Jr. was assassinated he wasn't advancing civil rights, he was organizing a Poor People's March on Washington to demand an economic bill of rights... \n\nBut unless you start organizing and actually threatening to cause real change, it seems that usually the FBI will just keep tabs on you or work to discredit you. 
Let's hope they do because I'm sure as fuck not paying for any more streaming services. 
Please tell me which branch of the intelligence community does not serve bourgeois interests.\n\nThe NSA is literally spying on all of us, all of the time. The CIA has overthrown dozens of democratically elected leftist governments throughout the world in order to protect American corporate profits. The FBI has *absolutely* investigated, discredited, and persecuted socialists and communists for decades, one notable example being MLK Jr... Please tell me where I'm wrong (except... I'm not, and this is factual information).  
Bbbbut purity tests! We need these "moderate" corporate neoliberals to continue sabotaging us or else something good night happen and we can't have that
You're right, it was Combetta, who was given immunity and then proceeded to offer nothing of value in return. He acknowledged that he knew there was a preservation order, that he knew it was illegal to delete the server, but did so anyway after having an "oh shit" moment where he realized he "forgot to do it" previously. \n\nOh and he was on a conference call *just before* with Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. Who also both received immunity. And Combetta claimed attorney-client privilege for the contents of the phone call, alleging that it was between Mills and Samuelson and concerned Hillary (with them acting as her attorneys).\n\nOh and he was later ***caught red handed*** asking on fucking Reddit of all places just prior to his deletions how one should go about editing the content of an exchange server. He was told it would be impossible or illegal and that it would be easier to just delete it. When this came out, he apparently had another OH SHIT MOMENT because he actively went through and deleted his entire post history, with people watching as it happened. \n\nBut yeah totally nothing fishy at all regarding the investigation right, just Republicans making stuff up, mhmm. 
If you can't distinguish between corporate neoliberals and "leftists" you should probably stop using the term
And they succeeded at not only rebuilding their entire industrial base in a couple years, but blunting and repelling the advance of one of the most capable armies in the world. They never tell you that in high school when they talk about the "efficiency of capitalism" or how we won the war all by ourselves.
Hillary being the better of two shitty choices and the investigation into her email server being a total shitshow are not mutually exclusive scenarios, you stupid motherfucker. People like you who think your side's shit doesn't stink because the other side is worse are fucking obnoxious and to blame for the deplorable state of politics in our country. \n\nInstead of blaming me for Trump's victory for having the gall to post about fucking factual occurrences, maybe you should direct a little bit of the blame towards Hillary and the DNC/media establishment for working to elevate his candidacy in the first place? Or for fucking Bernie out of the nomination, considering that he consistently polled better against Trump than anyone else while having none of Hillary's Wall Street/pharmaceutical/industrial ties in a year of unprecedented populist rage against the establishment? \n\nGo. Fuck. Yourself. 
I will try to be more civil in the future. Thank you for the polite warning/request rather than deleting my comment and/or banning me, as other subs would do. 
>I've been telling you and repeating yourself in a circular manner is daft  \n\nSays the person who keeps repeating "You're wrong! You don't know what you're talking about!" without offering any other statements as I offer historically based evidence that our IC organizations are 1) untrustworthy and 2) have consistently acted in the interest of the bourgeoisie.  
>There are no good guys in this  \n\nThere are "good guys" in this, they're just not 1) part of the establishment on the left or right and 2) not part of Trump's administration either, because Trump represents a reactionary counter-revolution spurred on by the increasingly-fast collapse of capitalism. Fascism is, as Trotsky puts it, the last resort of the bourgeois establishment to defend itself from revolution. \n\n >What is relevant, is that there is significant evidence that Trump’s entire team has inappropriate connections with Russia, and that Russia tampered with OUR election by hacking. \n\nI am not arguing against the former, but the election hack narrative was a fabrication to deflect from Wikileaks's revelations. If you'd like I can argue that further, but I've found that no matter what logical points are made people are seemingly bound to believe what the mainstream media has told them to believe. \n\n>So, if you really don’t like the intelligence agencies, then that is a fair issue to take up. But that is an entirely separate issue from Trump. You can attack the intelligence agencies based on a million proven things they have done, and try to push for reform.\n \nI am aware that they are a separate issue. But as you said, there are no good guys in this (I know this contradicts what I just said, but to me the "good guys" are the Berniecrats, and we lack political power currently), and there are a disturbing number of people who are lapping up everything the CIA says as if it's the gospel, like they are our champions in this fight against Trump, when they are still ultimately going to be aligned against the people and the working class. \n\n>The real issue we’re dealing with here has nothing to do with the IC. We have a Trump issue, and we just need to find out what sources we can trust as we try to deal with it. \n\nTrump is the most pressing issue, as there are a disturbing number of similarities between his election and the rise of fascism in Germany, but we still have an IC issue. We have an oligarchy issue, and our IC has consistently served the oligarchy. Trump may be the worst of the oligarchs, but that still holds true. \n\n>If you really think the IC is just “out to get Trump” then why the fuck did Come hand him the election on a silver platter?  \n\nOn this I would like to note that he could have recommended prosecution, but didn't, citing among other things the age of the 1917 Espionage act as well as lack of precedent for prosecution under gross negligence. Neither of those things mean she didn't break the law, they just declined to prosecute, effectively robbing a judge and jury the right to decide guilt. Flynn broke a law from 1799... I'm all for prosecuting those who break the law, but it should be consistently applied, and to anyone paying attention to Hillary's case it very clearly was not. Just a couple things in particular that stood out: \n\nCombetta was outed as /u/stonetear, and posted questions on Reddit asking about how to modify the content of an exchange server, both showing intent to do so as well as negating his immunity by contradicting his sworn testimony to the FBI (that being that he never consulted with anyone else on the matter of his deletions). Oh, and I'm *pretty sure* that deleting his Reddit posts one-by-one once found out constitutes destruction of evidence pertinent to a congressional investigation. This is the guy who, despite stating that he *was aware of the preservation orders* and that he should not delete anything, subsequently deleted everything (with BleachBit) after a 3 way conference call with Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. The contents of which is unknown, as all 3 are citing attorney client privilege (stating that the call was concerning Hillary in their capacity as her attorneys, and that Combetta was servicing the call as an IT tech). He deleted everything, admitted to doing so even after he knew that doing so would be illegal, voided his immunity by lying to the FBI, and then suffered no consequences.\n\nCheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson are incredibly fishy as well (on top of the aforementioned conference call). Both received immunity for no real reason whatsoever, it was given in exchange for their laptops, which the FBI could have simply subpoenaed. \n\nMills testified that she was unaware of the server's existence until it became public in the news, but there was an email from her to Justin Cooper where she said "HRC email getting bounced back, is the server okay?" and he said "you're silly, we're on the same server." When Comey was asked how that did not constitute evidence of her foreknowledge, and that she therefore lied to the FBI. He answered (under oath) that he could not (at that time) recall. \n\nThen there's, you know, Loretta Lynch's clandestine meeting on the tarmac with Bill Clinton, of which we only found out because of a local reporter sticking his nose in... \n\nOh, there's also the fact that Comey hemmed and hawed about having misgivings prosecuting without mens rea, when the law as it is written does not require mens rea ***and*** it can be imputed a number of ways, one of which is ***false exculpatory statements***. You know, like Hillary telling the media that she only had one device, that she used it for convenience, etc., innumerable statements were made which were then found to be false.\n\nI don't know how any reasonable person can look at even just these few events and conclude that the investigation was properly handled. If Trump were the subject, Democrats would rightfully be screaming for his head.
More like "Why is Wikileaks continuing to tweet cryptic garbage"
People mistakenly believe corporate neoliberalism = moderate, supporting the working class = far left, because politics and the history of class conflict are very poorly taught in our schools. 
I seriously doubt they had bunkers built and a doomsday scenario planned for a bomb that wasn't revealed until the day it had been tested and the Allies were already negotiating postwar Germany.
>Trump is a game show host. Hitler had a will to power. \n\nNot sure what you're trying to say with this\n\n>Trump wasn't hoisted in on the shoulders of a groundswell of nationalist rage  \n\nI agree that Hillary lost primarily because of how awful she is and that any candidate even slightly better than her would have beaten him (or even someone exactly the same, minus the DNC/Podesta leaks), but I don't know how you can claim the "Build a wall! Make America Great Again! Secure Our Borders!" crowd *isn't* nationalistic. \n\n>It's true that both Trump and Hitler are regarded as nonestablishment candidates, but that seems to be all some people need  \n\nI'm saying that they are similar because they both arose at a time of economic turmoil, both promised a return to greatness, both used incendiary, racist rhetoric, and both lead right-wing counter-revolutions coinciding with attempted left-wing revolutions (and both were victorious). Trump has a similarly loyal cult following, and a similar authoritarian bent. \n\nI'm not saying "TRUMP IS LITERALLY HITLER" like you seem to think I am, I am saying that there are a number of parallels to their respective elections, and in that light it is rather disturbing to see him surrounding himself with generals and with a literal white nationalist as his chief strategist. And further, it isn't encouraging that he removed white supremacists from the Countering Violent Extremism program. \n\nMaybe he won't end up a horrible dictator, but my point is that you would be incredibly foolish not to be vigilant to see that he does not. I think what is most likely to happen is 4-8 years of him looting the country before it's the Democrat's turn (to loot the country).
I wonder what the anti-Wikileaks narrative will be as they criticize Trump and his administration more and more often. 
> Ofcourse she didn't help the enemy \n\nFTFY\n\n
Dude did you not pay attention to all of the oversight hearings? Comey couldn't even answer when asked why they gave immunity to Mills instead of just seizing her laptop. He just dances around it. When asked how her "HRC email getting bounced back, server okay?" email to Justin Cooper did not serve as sufficient evidence that she knew if the server's existence and thereby perjured herself, he literally answered that he could not recall. \n\nComey hasn't even been trying to lock her up and anyone who thinks he is is naive. The oligarchs are going to defend the oligarchy. 
Because certainly we can't both prosecute child rapists *and* defend the human rights of LGBT people. It's impossible to do two good things at once, apparently. 
He talked to Russian ambassadors about lifting sanctions... that only exist because the media has falsely blamed Russia for Wikileaks... 
They show up just after Wikileaks announces upcoming Clinton related info and proceed to release nothing substantial while simultaneously sloppily leaving a trail of clues leading back to Russia which, despite being far from conclusive in itself and having no relation whatsoever with Wikileaks, has allowed the media to dismiss Wikileaks's revelations as being spooky Russian influence. \n\nYeah there's no waaaay Guccifer 2.0 is disinfo.
If you went by /r/politics you'd think the most damning thing in the leaks is a risotto recipe, yet simultaneously the leaks somehow constitute Russia taking Hillary down (even though there is and never has been any evidence at all tying ***Wikileaks's*** releases to Russia anyway).
[Remember when there were accounts of Hillary precinct captains fucking things up in the Iowa caucus?](https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/43sexj/cspan_stream_clinton_precinct_chair_lied_about/.compact) Which she won by a whopping .3%?\n\nThen the Des Moines Register ***which endorsed Hillary*** ran [articles questioning the authenticity of the election.](http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2016/02/03/editorial-something-smells-democratic-party/79777580/) Too bad primaries don't matter to all the millions of people protesting because Trump won...
Well, yeah, but that's what I mean by drug use in BNW not being depicted in a positive way. It's only ever shown as an escape from reality, and therefore a tool for the government in ensuring a compliant populace. After tripping Huxley was opened to the possibility of more constructive uses for drugs as tools for introspection as is shown in The Island.

I was referring to what he was saying about the media, but tbh I think that there is something to pizzagate as well. There is so much strange shit I have seen in the process of keeping up with it that I have a hard time believing that there is not, at the very least, some sort of human trafficking operation involved.\n\nHowever, since discussion was banned on Reddit, it's been forced onto Voat and /pol/ which are cesspools of actual Nazis, so now it's a chore to dig through hyperbolic claims of SMOKING GUN FOUND and shit like "FOURTH DIMENSIONAL TALMUDIC JEWS RUN PIZZAGATE!" and stupid shit like that. \n\n[Here's CBS's Ben Swann's piece on Pizzagate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSvUlkB61s) if you'd like something a little more... rational.
It looks like they're talking about identity politics which any actual marxist would tell you is a distraction from class.\n\nBut fuck I am sick of the status-quo defending liberals in /r/politics, and I'm equally sick of right wingers who think that corporatists are "the left" or that the biggest problem we have is globalism itself rather than an issue with who reaps the benefits of globalism. Divide and conquer all over, fuck.
"YOUR SIDE IS CORRUPT, NOT MINE!" \n\n-cheerleaders for two corrupt factions of the oligarchy
>and get the message they want across\n\nThis is the most important part. Too many idiots think that all the news cares about is ratings, when the ad revenue they get is piss in the wind in comparison to the value of their political influence. They care about ratings but only insofar as they care about the propagation of their self serving propaganda. Comcast/Time Warner/Disney et al didn't get into the news business to make money from ad revenue. 
It's apparently working since there are dipshits in every thread going "BBBBUT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO PRIMARY HIM WE NEED MODERATES" without realizing that ***corporate*** Democrats aren't politically moderate and they are hamstringing the fucking party. But woops, tears about purity tests from oblivious morons who don't understand that if we do not forcibly drag the party kicking and screaming back towards the left, we will never again have a party that actually represents the working class beyond the watered down version offered to us by corporate America. 
I am discussing their actions, which have consistently served the bourgeois since their inception. But okay buddy, apparently I'm being unfair for stating factual information. 
Implying conspiracies don't happen literally all the time. Any time two or more people collude in secret for secret aims, that is a conspiracy. I guess in your world people never plan anything in secret, since you're using *conspiracy theorist* as a pejorative like anyone who believes in any conspiracy is a lunatic by that fact alone.\n\nBut yeah, who cares that PNAC had been gunning for regime change in Iraq since, what, 1994? Who cares that their own manifesto states it would take a "pearl harbor like event" to achieve their aims, who cares that we went into Afghanistan and then Iraq based on lies overtly told to us by the CIA. Who cares that Bush's brother was in charge of security at both Dulles AND the WTC at the time of the attacks. Anyone who thinks there's something off about 9/11 is just nuts! /s\n\nNote: I'm not one of those people who rant about jet fuel and steel beams, or who think there was a controlled demolition or whatever. I am a rational person who looks at cause and effect and the geopolitical consequences of our foreign policy. There is absolutely a case to be made that Bush's administration, if not *directly responsible*, at the very least took advantage of the attack for political purposes. I don't know why *that's* so hard for you to believe, unless you're being wilfully blind. \n\nSince you seem to think any conspiracy theory is somehow inherently deserving of ridicule, you might want to like educate yourself on what our intelligence agencies have actually done. 
He represents another faction of the oligarchy, but he's still an oligarch
The issue with that is that you and those like you say "centrist" when the people to whom you refer are neoliberal corporatists. If (as merely *one* example) a Democrat collects hundreds of thousands of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry and then works against single payer healthcare, they're not a fucking moderate- they're a servant of the oligarchy.
Yeah, I'm backwards because I'm not advocating stripping people of basic human rights because they make me feel scared and I don't have some vague sense of "morals" from a 2000 year old book that have, ironically, morphed into a caricature of the actual teachings of the founder of that religion. Yup, you're totally right.\n\nAlso way to once again sidestep everything intellectually with some stupid throwaway nonsensical strawman (arguing that "the personin office was most definitely LEFT," which is 1) irrelevant to what is being said and 2) laughably incorrect on multiple counts). I said that the statement that you made on "the decay of morals" has logic consistent with that used by ISIS and other right-wing extremist groups, which is fucking true. \n\nIt's really funny how you say you are against identity politics, yet here you are defending divisive bigotry as if it were somehow easier to fight, in court, the progress of LGBT rights than to acquiesce and let people shit in peace and focus on "more important things."\n\nI guess I'm done here since you keep ignoring any questions that actually demand you to think. Still waiting on your verdict on where CAIS individuals are allowed to poop. \n\n>Please tell me more about transgender and homosexual rights in the middle east.\n>The Woman's March supports a woman who promotes Sharia Law.\n>SJWs lost their mind long ago. You may literally not have a single idea what you are talking about.\n\nI didn't say anything about LGBT rights in the middle east, you stupid fucker\n\nNo, it doesn't, but I do agree with you that the women's march is retarded- all of these people should have paid attention to politics when Bernie was getting fucked out of the nomination, but woops. \n\nI'm not a fucking SJW you dumbfuck.

Planned parenthood doesnt receive special funding. They are just elligible to be pid with medicare and medicaid. Abortions are not covered by medicaid. \n\nEvery regular doctors office, etc... Is elligible for this
> Trump is a symptom of the cancer of the right in America\n\n["The military ruin of German and Italian fascism in WWII convinced most people that fascism had been destroyed for good and was so utterly discredited that it could never again entice any followers. Events since then, particularly the emergence of new fascist groups and tendencies in almost every capitalist country,have dispelled such wishful thinking. The illusion that WWII was fought to make the world safe from fascism has gone the way of the earlier illusion that WWI was fought to make the world safe for democracy. The germ of fascism is endemic in capitalism; a crisis can raise it to epidemic proportions unless drastic countermeasures are applied."](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm)
When the fuck are you going to realize that you have more than one enemy? You have the Trumpists *and* the corporate neoliberals to worry about. It's not one or the other. Jesus fucking fuck. 
>There are bigger issues than what bathrooms people get to use.\n\nNo shit Sherlock, but maybe, just maybe, we are capable of justice in both instances rather than just fucking one. Jesus. I'm all for busting pedophilia rings but you might want to get off your high horse when you're literally saying it's okay to demolish human rights as long as "something more important" (*to you*) is being taken care of. 
Your inability to appropriately name and describe political ideologies is both intentional on the part of those in control as well as harmful in terms of our ever making progress against them. While you rail against "leftists," corporatists on "the left" *and* right are robbing us both blind, laughing all the way to the bank.
I bet if you asked him he wouldn't be able to recall
>Hillary being the better of two shitty choices and the investigation into her email server being a total shitshow ***are not mutually exclusive*** scenarios, you stupid motherfucker.\n\nLearn to read, dumbshit. Accept reality and then tell me exactly what the fuck business you have telling me off for mentioning factual occurrences regarding her investigation. Oh, wait, you haven't any because you're operating purely on an emotional response because your brain cannot process contempt for more than one political figure at a time, so you must defend Your Guy. \n\n
I don't know where he would have ever explicitly advised a government to use drugs to control their citizenry, but yes, that was a theme of BNW and soma's role in it. But that was 20 or so years before he first tried mescaline. If you read The Doors of Perception you will see that he acknowledges the constructive uses of psychedelics in terms of facilitating introspection and expanded awareness. There is more to drug use than escape, which is all he ever depicted it as in BNW.
Looooool
I understand how elections work, thanks. Apparently it's meaningless to you when an election is decided by a small margin *and there just happens to be documented fraud* and inconsistencies to the point where a newspaper which endorsed the victor called for scrutiny that never came. I assume it's also meaningless to you as well that the state party chair's license plate is literally HRC2016... "yup, nothing to see here, just a primary being a primary" -/u/Groomper \n\nJust in case you come back with some explanation as to how county/state delegates differ as though I'm unaware and some naive assertion that small inconsistencies don't matter, I'm just going to have stop you in advance and say that we disagree. Small inconsistencies here and there stack up eventually to something meaningful, *especially* if your naive belief that these issues are unintentional rather than willful subversions of democracy. 
Wow what a stunning rebuttal. Shill harder. 
So what part of what I said are you denying, specifically?
The media is failing universally because its blatant self serving political agendas, both on the "left" and "right," are becoming increasingly apparent. I don't think I need to mention Fox News's bias or Breitbart's, but I'm never going to forgive or forget the corporate media bias during the 2016 primaries. I'm not going to forget the Wikileaked emails showing CNN/ABC/WashPo/NYTimes/Politico/et al working directly with the Clinton campaign. I'm not going to forget the Pied Piper email where they expressly delineate a plan to elevate Trump's status in his own primary. \n\nI'm not going to forget how CNN in particular literally cut off their live feed as a congressman brought up Wikileaks in an unscripted context, complete with Cuomo almost sarcastically saying "oh no, how did that happen?" during the DNCLeaks. I'm not going to forget how he also literally told the public that it's illegal to view the emails on your own instead of through CNN. \n\nThe only real way to save CNN is to let it die the death it deserves and replace it with more objective journalism. Good fucking luck finding that, though. We *are* living in a post-truth society, unfortunately, because *everyone* is biased. The only thing you can do is consume a wide variety of sources and weigh the content against the bias, but that's impossible without consuming alternative media because the overwhelming majority of mainstream media is literally controlled by the same six companies. And too many people forget that outlets like The Washington Post *will* push corporate propaganda because they're owned by the same corporations that run our government. 
Cleveland because its cleveland

Posts like this are depressing. I should not read them. 
King Henry VIII had 2 wives beheaded. He claimed they cheat him which would be treason. Even though he was allowed to cheat on them any time he wanted.\n\n
Ezekiel Elliot gets cut due to domestic abuse Charges. Eagles trade Carson Wentz for Jarrod Goff. Redskins listen to Daniel Snyder and just keep doing what he says

You gotta go old school. Its Charlie Conerly.\n\nRookie of the year, mvp, 3 rings, Hall of Fame. You could put him ahead of eli if you factor in when he played
There numbers will go down. Not enough shots and balls to grab. If they play well together their shooting percentage should go up.
Liberal fascists for punching a nazi? Yeah this is a trumpster trash supporter. \n\nI wouldnt punch so one for being a nazi unless the guy says Im a fucking nazi. 
How were picks less valuable? There was no free agency.
You wouldnt know it from the foxnews website. They ignored that but have Wallaces interview with Rush Limbaugh highlighted
Chris wallace gave a pretty softball interview to rush limbaugh right after he ripped into trump. So he isnt a liberal press guy either. 
Who is in the dnc? This isnt entirely clear. Does obama get a vote? Just curren congressman?
Someone might grab Trump by the ass pussy. 
I expect Trump to change how economic growth is calculated and then show 4% growth. \n\n3-3.5% growth sustained would require "magic" or some SF / alien technology to be discovered. We are fully developed. We are not playing catchup like China who can grow faster to catchup.\n\nIf we coud get sustained and true 3.5% economic growth for a while, we coud balance the budget, cut taxes, and increase spending.\n\nAlso the US dollar would get so strong every job thst could be offshored would. 
2 playoff wins between them in the last 20 years
They really are sending rapists. Trump was right
Trump is too stupid to know how to be insulated
Go outside. You need vitamin D
McMahon disnt last. He was injured all the time after 1985. He also wasnt very good. One good year with a great team around him . He was out for the 1986 playoffs.\n\nThe bears were not good enough to beat the giants on the road on 1986 even wirh mcmahon. 
We didnt have google growing up. If i ask my mom anything she told me to look it up in the encyclopedia
Its worse than the travel costs. When trumps kids went latin america, the embassy spent money putting up staff in the hotel to support them. Support for what? Profiteering on the tax payer.\n\nThe costs are going to run into the billions a year for security and travel fr Trump and his family. I expect trump to continue to profiteer on his office. 
Minnesota needs t be banned from trading with nfc east teams not named the giants. Between herschel walker and the trade last year with the eagles
Fbi leader doesnt resign. He serves a fixed term. Trump cant fire him. The customary resignation letters are frim political appointees whose jobs end when administration ends. Its like the fed chair. The fbi director also serves terms

So basically atleast one top 5 bust every year.
They will never get released. We have to hope they leak. His returns are so huge getting the full ones out is not practical. Its also guaranteed that his tax returns at the IRS are closely guarded. I think they do that for all presidents. \n\nWe gotta hope that same employee at trump tower who leaked 1 page of trumps return leaks more.
Hos hard is it for trump to fudge the numbers so he can lie and say we got this level of growth? I expwct him to try that next.
He kept the guy with the sick daughter on the practice squad so he could have medical benefits. Most businesses dont care. That is a big positive
His prison will be nearby. Maybe work release?
He knows enough not to want him

Like most people, you are used to being able to step out to a movie, dinner, take a drive. You cant do that as president. On top of that his family isnt there so he is alone.\n\nAll presidents have issues with this. I beleive Michelle Obama said something about finally being able to open a window again. There was a video of obaa driving his own golf cart the day after hewas out of office. He supposed wasnt allowed to do that when in office. \n\nIts gotta be weird being president and have the secret service "go no you cant drive a golf cart"\n\nAnywhere you requires an entourage for security and your responsibilities.\n\nTrumps a dick, but this is something all presidents go through. Lis he is alone.
2000 giants. Worst team to make a superbowl.
Your getting way ahead of yourself. They would need a tremendous amount of evidenve to go there on a US president. Second, though Comey serves a term and cant be fired Trump,could tell him he wants him gone. Alot of democrats are still bitter about his bullshit from the election and some too stupid to realize that if Comey goes, trump will replace him with a loyalist and kill any investigation.\n\nI dont know if Comey would resign if Trump tells him too. 
Was it hot out? When I was a kid, we brought my dog to the park on a hit day. She jumped in the pond to cool off.

Jets started 10-1 in 1986. Loat their last 5 games. Made the playoffs. Won 1 game.\n\nTheir 4 best defensive players got injured. 2 were Joe Klecko and Mark Gastinesu. 2 best defensive linemen in the league thst year. They alo lost a pro boel lnebacker and their best corner.\n\nWe were talking about a subway superbowl before those injuries. 
Churches have no legal right to provide sanctuary. If she keeps speaking out Trump could send ICE in to arrest her.
Why?
He threatened to quit during the transition because Trump tried to put his yes men at DoD. If he isnt happy he will quit. He doesnt have to try to get fired.
Jimmy johnson trickrd them. The picks were tied to players being cut. If the cowboys cut all the players they got in the trade, they got the draft picks. The owner of the vikings was an idiot and thought the cowboys would keep them and not take the pick.
Any political appointee who attacks the boss gets fired. He either knew what he was doing would get him fired or he is an idiot. \n\nThat being sad, Id like to see an interview with him.\n\n
He fits in well with the giants if he will be reasonable on salary. Giants are desperate for a right tackle. 
We dont inow what he is worth. Most of his assets are real estate and fixed. He doesnt have billions in cash. 
So if I want to block the Trump Organization websites, I can pay a Russian bride $100 to marry me, divorce her, and slip in take down orders of all Trump websites?
Im not seeing trump impeached by republicans. They promised their constituents a right wing agenda. Impeachment and removal is a long process and brings that to a hault.\n\n
Conservative sub is now run by Trump fans. They took over /r/conspiracy. They only allow crazy anti left conspiracies. They dont allow any stupid conspiracies back.\n\nI would hope the liberal subs would be more reasonable with criticism. I would recommend that if libertarians want to post some critical stuff their to point out you are libertarians( say to check your post history) and you just want a discussion. There have been issues with Trumpys spamming and racists coming in as well.\n\nI have found libertarians in this sub to be reasonable to talk to. So you guys should be fine on the liberal subs ... Just piint out you want a discussion and your not a Trumpy.

Who is insulating trump and how? Trump is too stupid to know how to insulate himself. His personal lawyer who is totally unqualified worked with a Ukranian businessman. This dors insulate him. This makes it obvious its Trumps plan. \n\nThis shit is leaking like a salve. Imagine who had to leak this? I dont beleive the NYT sited a source. It had to be soneone high up and in the West wing right? Unless his lawyer is an idiot and he told staff at his law firm and they leaked. That is possible. They are totally unqualified and stupid.\n\nIf staff in the west wing are leaking, that means his own close staff doesnt trust him. Or it could be such a toxic environment that this was leaked due to infighting and they want Cohen gone. \n\n

Thank you!
BERNIE SAID NO!
No he is great. He does not take votes from Keith do not worry.\n\nHe is joining the vets at Standing Rock that is a great attitude. Yes i agree that people should be as much like BERNIE authentic and humble.
I'm far away. Is it the Vet cause? Which is the best? Phoning the white house okay. WHAT is the ACLU doing with all the money they just got. I want them there now!\nYou cannot just google express can you? Or can you? How can someone get supplies that are innocent. they need down comforters and jackets, coats, wool, water, canned goods. How can you get stuff to the right people. There is something for the vets . Do you know anything about that?
Because before he was Muslim he was Catholic. People that have been more than one thing in life can appreciate different perspectives. Rural white people voted for Obama and stood out in freezing weather to do so.\nHe has an entire army so who knows where he would go and where others would be sent. He has been through so much and up against it that he is really mature, smart and has a lot of grace. He is also humble which is what rural mid west likes. They like politeness. He is a real fighter which they will respect. He will not talk down to them. They know that the republicans and democrats do not care. They are worried about their drinking water, jobs , healthcare, farming, property taxes.\nHe has a record of fighting for workers rights. He stood up for Bernie and they like Bernie. He is a great person. People can see that. He will talk about nuts and bolts directly to them.Most will like him once they know him. 
The Army Corps of engineers are needed to work on environmental projects such as sustainable infrastructure. Many do not want this job\nand are being forced to do it. This crap is happening in this weather.
They just hate enthusiasm for their own party what idiots. \nI just donated to keith DNC chair in two different place.\n\n800,000 signatures for Keith and tons of endorsements.
Yeah at this point ck histories.
Win already I can't stand it.
Bernie already said no to this recently.
ewwwww the picture.
I am more tactful than you are. If you do not like Sam good for you.\n\nLove for Sam is dangerous... you are so hyperbolic and you use profanity while instructing someone to be tactful.  You get points for loving MLK and you do not like pantsuits. That is good. Right now all I want is for Keith Ellison to win. I can't stand that there will be yet another DNC debate on Wednesday. Maybe Sam will not be there because he is in Standing Rock. Or will he be there on national television? I do not know. Do you know?\n\n\n\n
Shit article pro perez who was pro TPP.
I can't stand it.
Keith Ellison for DNC chair. What if the Chair race was an actual chair race? Office chairs with wheels.
Pence whats him impeached so he can be president and the impeachment will help down ballot dem elections.
SEE???? Many Donald trump voters are great people. They just wanted jobs and would have voted for Bernie.
KEITH ELLISON NOW!!!!!
wait a second are you the guy that posted the video about how you do not like Sam? Are you that nice guy that is so humble in the video?
I did both crowd pac and keith for DNC
I do not care if you are a troll or a trump voter. YES YOU ARE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I once thought why are people still having babies and it could be destiny. Overpopulation is creating all of the problems. Immigrants who are environmental scientists  are the ones that I want. We do pay Mexicans to come over and help fight forest fires in Texas , California and do other environmental work.They live in Mexico and are heroes. \nImmigrants care about jobs and do not care about the environment . Next generation cares more. Then third generation cares. Also the millions of people that are already here should stop having so many kids. Millions of poor white people do not need to breed like rabbits either. China could not control its population even when they tried in humane one child policy. I value human life. Just stop having babies please. All over the world the pollution is horrible because of overpopulation. This could just be fate. The pollution factors could be the highest in Iran. Some people do not have access to birth control\nand are forced to have sex. So they are not at fault. Others want children because they want someone to take care of them in their old age.Selfish. There are some people who would make such good parents that they should have children. Also many white people are learning Spanish and moving to other countries to retire. Even people with great jobs cannot afford to retire in the United States.
Run for office please! Not just DNC chair but get back one of the 1000 seats that we lost. 
Great art!
Ellison or I will go nuts. I will non stop post cute animal photos. I will be relentless.
nice alt account coward.
Wait a second How come the GREAT RAY BUCKLEY is there when he dropped out of the race to endorse Keith Ellison? 
Yes he will. Yes he wants every county , every district in every state.\nHe will go to white rural America. He was raised Catholic. He will talk jobs , healthcare, property taxes, small farm rights, money for farmers to get tractors, small business, broadband, clean water, and poor struggling rural whites that can barely survive will enjoy someone doing something for once. He already has demographic reach out programs. 
HE IS ONE OF THE BIG SIX!!!!!!

The government has been killing Native Americans for hundreds of years. The Indian Removal Act. The walking purchase. The Indian boarding schools. Treachery, broken promises and genocide. What can we do?
Yes and also 800,000 signatures. I pledged 50 to crowd pac for Keith which only charges you if he becomes DNC chair. I also donated 10 For Keith for DNC chair. Right now Keith Ellison wants sheer numbers\nso If you can donate more great but if you can donate 1 dollar it increases the number of donors. 
from the article:\n"Just a year ago, on 03/01/16, the world's 6 richest men had $343 billion. They're the same men today, although slightly rearranged as they play "king of the hill": Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Amancio Ortega, Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Slim Helu (with Larry Ellison jockeying for position). The wealth of these six men increased by $69 billion in just one year. "
something in del rey florida which is in that county. I saw it.
Jesus Christ endorses Ellison. Zeus God of thunder endorses Ellison. Ganeshe Hindu God, lord of medicine and remover of obstacles endorses Ellison. Johnny Cash who died endorses Ellison. President Abe Lincoln endorses Ellison. Aliens from other planets endorse Ellison. He has so many endorsements a ton more then perez and there is a debate on Wednesday. This is going on forever.
And he started out with major endorsements.
don't mention her name.
He is getting more endorsements everyday. Contributions and pledged contributions to the DNC plus 800,000 signatures. He is a fighter because he can't please anyone because he is for everyone. :)
Thank you for this.\n\nread it.\nUp vote please!
from the article:\n"The 3,100km concrete wall Donald Trump plans to build along the US-Mexico border would be a disaster for the border zone's ecosystems, writes Shonil Bhagwat. Among the species at risk: ocelots, bears, Bighorn sheep, the US's last wild jaguars facing genetic isolation north of the border, and the Bald eagle, the US's national bird."
Check out the husband dressed in comfortable clothes while the wife is in a straight jacket of black material. A very personal call for comfortable clothing for everyone. Get the children somewhere safe please.
Don't forget he was once DNC chair!
"Faced with an imminent evacuation deadline, Indigenous opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline are vowing to stand their ground despite threats of arrest and possible violence.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday refused to extend the Wednesday 2pm GMT deadline for the few hundred remaining water protectors to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, claiming that the camp is at risk of flooding. Representatives have asked for an extension, saying they can clear out without the Corps' help, but need more time.\n\nMeanwhile, the activists say they are surrounded by law enforcement with reports of an increased presence of federal Bureau of Indian Affairs vehicles in the surrounding area.\n\n"We have 48 hours before militarized law enforcement raid Oceti Sakowin camp. Elders and children need protection," states a video that was distributed on Monday by women from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.\n\n"After the deadline for February 22 at 2pm, we are all at risk of facing arrest, police brutality, federal charges and prison time," declares one of the women.\n\n"In the history of colonization, they've always given us two options," said another. "Give up our land or go to jail, give up our rights or go to jail. And now, give up our water, or go to jail. We are not criminals."\n\nThe video concludes with a plea for other protectors and media to come to the camp before the forced evacuation, saying: "We need your help."\n\nThroughout the months-long resistance effort, pipeline opponents have protested through legal channels as well as peaceful civil disobedience. In return, they have faced dog attacks, water cannons in subzero temperatures, and tear gas, in addition to arrest and trumped up charges."
up vote this test post please. Just because.
He is just starting out and already people know him. He will do well!
Damn, you right 
baby boomers do care and many baby boomers are in terrible financial position as well.. Also baby boomers have children.\n\nMillenials  deserve so much it is crazy and many generations back this up. Their are people in their 50's, 60's committing suicide because they cannot afford to live anymore. You have to realize this . When I call for Bernie or other candidates I can reach people of all ages. 
great post and very insightful.
You are one of the greatest posters but Bernie already said no recently. I want to thank you for all of your great posts. 
ohhhh that is so cute!
I thought Bernie said no but he said wait. If Ellison does not get it. Maybe who knows. Ellison has got to win.
I did not see him talk. I am just happy that he called out the DNC and is going to Standing Rock. Fan boying is such a strange terminology. 
More party member came out it is posted on other site. YAY!
I do not agree with not stopping the movement. Anti trump is stupid and might as well go for r/ politics. Be for something, healthcare, workers rights, small farms, the environment, education, unions, regulating banks etc. I agree with you.
that is sometimes the only meal that they get.
He does not care if you contribute one dollar. He needs to show numbers.
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!
Yesterday I did both Crowd pac for Keith and pledged 50 if he becomes DNC chair I also donated 10 to Keith for DNC chair.
The roaches would live on and eventually form a utopian society.\n
Keith Ellison was great!
up vote please!
He started out with major endorsements as well.
Well nice to meet you.
all you do is troll and tell people how smart you are and how aggressive you are. What went wrong with your potty training?\nYou say that you are elite. I'm glad that you are published in biology\nand that you are more aggressive than females. Are you progressive and what issues do you care about? Does it bother you that trump is anti science and screwing us over?
her little dog timmy has got to go away.
From the article:\n"Veterans Unite for Second 'Deployment' Against Dakota Access Pipeline\n\nBy Sophie Lewis, CNN\n\n19 February 17\n\n \n\nhe troops are mobilizing for a second "deployment."\n\nThe Veterans Stand group is once again raising funds for protesters who have been fighting construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. So far, the GoFundMe effort for the new campaign has raised $186,767 of the $500,000 goal, according to the group's GoFundMe page. The funds will go toward supplies for the North Dakota protest camp, transportation of veterans to and from Standing Rock Indian Reservation and operations. The Facebook page sites increased "turmoil and uncertainty" as a motivation to continue efforts."\n
What I mean is that he was raised Catholic and then had a spiritual experience when he was young and became Muslim. Christians get mad at him. Other Muslims don't think he is Muslim enough. He supports LGBT community so he can't win. I love him. I donated to him and he better win or I am posting 10,000,000 cute animal photos on this Reddit.
Pete is great bur we want Keith. I just donated to Keith for DNC chair and also pledged to crowd pac for Keith.
Give more info, which election, district, office etc.
Ran Learns thanks to you and your efforts I donated \n10.00 to Keith for DNC chair\nand pledged 50 to crowd pac! I posted on each and showed receipts!\n
What happened to the two state solution?
You are great. I donated 10 to the Keith for DNC and pledged 50 to crowd pac yesterday. Thank you for letting us all know.
I don't think Ellison will go right. No way. I want an actual chair race\npreferably down hill. Sort of like a go cart race. Candidates will be allowed to modify office chairs. I want perez to have those shopping cart wheels where one does not work and he derails off to the side. I do want him to get hurt just upended in some brush.
No they will vote the way Bernie tells them to vote because people who care will help them. trump will be an impeached footnote.
HYPE
No it is not a dumb question since this is convoluted. DNC party chair s vote and there is what 447 of them. They vote once and if someone does not have the majority then then knock out the person with the least votes and vote again. They do rounds until someone has the majority.
Keith does not want us calling. You can twitter and facebank. You can donate 27 or even 1 dollar to Keith for DNC chair or you can pledge money for Keith through crowd pac and you only get charged if he gets elected.
But that is what Keith is best at organizing and mobilizing and he has an army behind him.
Well are you aware of the great legacy Obama created by making monuments of oceans, forests, deserts and so forth. It is a record breaker and we need to preserve it. Thank you for your take on things.
Sam will be joining the vets at Standing Rock as well. We may want Keith Ellison for DNC chair but we LOVE SAM RONAN!!!!
"“If Tom Perez were to win, the message that would send to the grassroots, to labor unions that endorsed Ellison before Tom Perez joined the race, [is] that their voices, their muscle, their enthusiasm and turnout doesn’t matter,” Lawson added.\n\nEllison backers acknowledge that the liberal protest movement that has taken shape since President Donald Trump’s inauguration ― not the DNC race ― has become the focus of grassroots energy. A loss for Ellison now could limit the party’s ability to tap into that enthusiasm, but it wouldn’t stop the movement."
BERNIE SAID NO TO THIS!!!!!! 
testing 1,2,3, 
Any other decent parents would be crazy proud of you. I am and keep going.
no.
BERNIE ALREADY SAID NO TO THIS!
What really? okay I'll stop saying no.
Thank you! 
We do not vote and thousans of people have endorsed the great KEITH ELLISON!!!

THIS SUCKS!
yeah I was wondering that as well.
actually someone told me he said no wait I'm working on something.\n\nIf he goes third party so will I.
I can't believe it without Keith Ellison.
That's no way to speak to this grandmotherly looking person.:)
"PUBLIC SAFETY?\nTaxpayer-Funded Horror at Standing Rock\nPolice brutality against protesters here for the past year is reminiscent of civil rights battles like Selma. Will it turn bloody when authorities tell protesters to leave this week?\nSandy Tolan\nSANDY TOLAN\n\n02.21.17 8:03 PM ET\nALONG THE CANNONBALL RIVER, North Dakota—The following story is brought to you by the taxpayers of North Dakota.\nIt was a bitter cold night on the Backwater Bridge when Efrain Montalvo got the desperate call from the front line.\n“The medics were screaming for help, because they were overwhelmed,” remembered Montalvo, 25, a member of the International Indigenous Youth Council at Standing Rock. He looked up through white mists of teargas, cut by screams and shouts on the bridge. Native elders stood motionless in front of barricades of razor wire, clutching feathers, burning prayer bundles of sage, holding their ground. They were unarmed, eyes shut tight against the clouds of pepper spray. Others held up plywood shields or the tops of plastic bins against the spray. “Disperse!” shouted police, who then unleashed a fire hose, soaking protestors in the sub-freezing temperatures. Icicles formed on their hair. Their winter jackets crunched.\n\nMontalvo moved swiftly toward the front line, carrying bottles of water and Milk of Magnesia (to relieve the teargas sting) toward the medics. Riot-clad police, ensconced behind concrete barriers and the looping wire, began firing rubber bullets. Montalvo watched an elder fall at his feet, his staff clattering to the pavement of the shut-down state highway. Then police launched a barrage of smoking teargas canisters from grenade launchers.\n“That’s when people started panicking,” Montalvo recalled.\nA tear gas canister hit Montalvo squarely in the chest. He inhaled its smoke deeply, then wandered aimlessly, hands over his eyes. Two minutes later he could see again. Another canister exploded at his feet. He saw a brilliant white light. Then everything went black and silent.\nMontalvo began shaking uncontrollably. For 10 minutes, “I couldn’t remember who I was, where I was.” Medics whisked him off the bridge. Days later, he could still taste the tear gas in his mouth.\nMontalvo was one of hundreds of unarmed “water protectors” facing down North Dakota police at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation on that evening of Nov. 20. The clashes had begun after protestors attempted to clear the bridge of two burned-out pickup trucks blocking highway passage since a day of mass arrests three weeks earlier.\nThroughout the fall and early winter, the 10-month showdown over the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) has been bitter and violent. At least 1,000 Standing Rock protestors, according to camp medics, have been treated for chemical poisoning, hypothermia, rubber bullet and “nonlethal” beanbag wounds, and many more serious injuries, all as a direct result of violence from militarized police, who sometimes arrive by the hundreds. On Nov. 20 at the Backwater Bridge, 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky nearly had hear arm blown off. Vanessa Dundon, a 32-year-old Navajo, was shot in the eye by a tear gas canister. In all, some 700 people have been arrested in dozens of confrontations with police. Many have been held in dog kennel-like metal cages, numbers scrawled on their arms."\n\n

I don't believe Bernie was pushing for anything at the same time Dr. Sanders was a Commissioner. I don't see any way for either of them to profit off of both of them being involved with TLLRWD's activities. \n\nAlso, whats with the downvoting of anything potentially critical of Bernie? Not cool people.

Two questions today.  \nFirst of the two is a staple of reddit. \nWould you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck sized horses.  \n\nSecondly, a more serious one.   \nAs a religious person, I constantly tire of hearing religious voters equated with the GOP. I believe this is, in part, their parties extensive outreach and work with evangelical communities. I don't see much of this on our  side. What should the Democratic party do to better engage religious voters on the left?\n\n
Why does everyone always think its her?

Hi
Shows how long I've been away from Verizon.
> Why on earth would Bernie set up his organization to be able to take large, anonymous donations? This seems against everything he stands for. There must be more to this. Anyone have insight?\n\nA 501(c)4 is completely different from a Super PAC, which is a 527 organisation. The issue people are concerned with is 501(C)4s being used to raise anonymous money for Super PACs

Based on my understanding, it's only real options are to be a PAC and/or 501(c)4. If they want to lobby politicians and mobilize grassroots action, the latter is probably the better choice. If they want to help fund various campaigns, a PAC is probably a better choice. In addition, numerous other similar groups have incorporated this way such as MoveOn, Organising for Action,  and Demand Progress.  \nYes, 501(c)4 organisations can fundraise for PACs which can make it harder to trace the money for campaigning activities and that's pretty concerning. However, I doubt the fact they chose to incorporate at a 501(c)4 means anything nefarious is afoot. 
I've never had this issue on QC. If you have noticed this with a lot of sites lately, you may want to run a malware scan.

AT&T and T-Mobile (which are gsm networks) use sims. Verizon and Sprint (CDMA networks) do not.
> You should take a look at how much Sanders got from "Big Pharma" last year.  \n\nLet see, the 2016 election cycle. Sanders for President raised a total of $228,171,330. Of that total $226M came from individual donations, representing ~99% of all contributions to the campaign.[1] He took almost 6k from PACs (less than 1%).[1] Even if all those PAC donations came from pharma pacs, it itsn't very much.  \nAlright, so maybe a ton of people who work in the pharmaceutical industry donated big. So, lets look at what companies employ these people and run the pacs that have donated. Clocking in at number 1 you have Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google and Nest. They do own a biotech startup named Calico, but thats about as close as you get. These donations linked to Alphabet total $392,543. [2][3]Looking at the rest, there aren't large amounts of money linked to pharma companies, even through their employees.   \nAlright, so all this big pharma money must not be actually going to the campaign. They must have been campaigning for him independently. This is actually where you get closest to having big pharma being involved, as National Nurses United, a major union of Nurses, spent $4.7Million campaigning for Sanders. [4][5] They were the only outside committee to spend more than 1 million dollars in support of Sanders through independent expenditures. The rest of the independent expenditures come from various other unions (none of which seem to represent workers working for big pharma), leftist orgs, and individuals.   [4][5] \n  \n[1] http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate?id=N00000528   \n[2] http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?cycle=2016&id=N00000528&type=f  \n[3] https://beta.fec.gov/data/committee/C00577130/?cycle=2016&tab=receipts\n[4] http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/outside-spending?id=N00000528  \n[5] https://beta.fec.gov/data/candidate/P60007168/?election_full=true&cycle=2016&tab=other-spending

Not immediately obvious. A passerby would never know that you take a ton of pills for something or often require a cane. People are often ignorant of illnesses and disabilities that aren't visually detectable. Fibromyalgia, for example, isn't visible. However, someone with it may require a handicap placard as it may be difficult at times to walk longer distances. Many people will quickly write someone like this off as being lazy when they don't see them using a wheelchair or walker after parking in an accessible parking space.
Your $3 would go towards funding the work we want to do through the political revolution,. backing progressive candidates and issues.

This is only the case for CDMA networks such as Verizon and Sprint. AT&T and T-Mobile use SIM cards.
I think you know what they meant.

I was thinking this the other day. I don't see Hillary leading it though, maybe we go with the second place contender from the primaries in that case? ;)
It evolved that way because it was once a straight, long fruit that was commonly consumed by snakes that swallowed them whole to digest the tough skin. Having a sharp bend made it difficult for theses snakes to swallow the fruit and continue moving around. Alternately, maybe there was a creature with a snout that produced a caustic substance to break through the fruit's skin, for a similar effect.

Wow, he is.
I've heard of that. Good community?
Independence party and the progressives don't have enough to form a government in their own though. So if the same people are to remain in power, they need to win support from another party, perhaps Revival.

They are funded by nationbuilder which is really in it to make some money.. but its still a neat tool with plenty of potential.

Clearly you do not know what the DSA is. First, it's not a party(Socialist Alternative and the PSL are). Second, it does not advocate for the elimination of private property (as some forms of socialism and communism do advocate for).  Most DSA members advocate for what would actually still be a mixed economy, like ours is already. \nRead up on them please and give us some better arguments.

Trump appoints Fox News analyst as deputy NatSec adviser\n\n
Apparently they are still working on that. You can volunteer to help them out if you want. Also, ballotpedia can be used to look up what offices may exist, though they don't have comprehensive coverage of municipal governments either.
I mean, the people in that thread are citing studies and talking about science tho.\n\nNot saying that other people in this thread aren't also citing 'science'. Both sides are referencing scientific studies, and then arguing over which are correct. But if you read even just the wikipedia article about this subject, you'll find that within the psychological community there is a great deal of contention surrounding the idea of sex differences in intelligence, with many modern researchers positing that the results of previous studies on the subject were biased or poorly designed. Either way, new studies are needed to check these results, and these new studies will, inevitably, based on design, have different results.
I mean, not allowing you to make your own character allowed them to tell a more powerful and personal story then they would have otherwise?
No, congressman are up for reelection every few years. There are just no limits on how many terms a congressman can remain in congress, and incumbents tend to have the advantage in the US
It's a Trump quote. \nhttp://www.snopes.com/trump-sends-unpresidented-tweet/
Pod Save America did an interview with Perez, it's worth a listen.
IMO do it anyway. It sends something of a message, at least, that you would call even though you know you'd be laughed at.
I mean he's already ignored a court order, which is explicitly not within the bounds of presidential authority. 
I always love it when oregon and california switch places, too
Most of cali's water comes from inside the state. About 55% of the water that's used in socal comes from the Colorado river, but large portions of that comes from the sections of the river that Cali controls. Not in favor of Cali succession but water wouldn't be our main problem.
I don't believe he was trying to attack you personally- that looks more like gentle ribbing to me. I think he was trying to make a joke there.
So, in the past month one Shareblue post has reached the top spot of this subreddit. Now, that's not great- it certainly isn't an unbiased source. But the headline of the post was a Stephen Miller quote (with some leftist editorializing surrounding it). I don't know if it's fair to insult the integrity of the subreddit for having shared to the top one Shareblue post when the post was factual, just heavily editorialized. I looked again for top posts on the past week, and could find only one other Shareblue post on that page. That one was definitely questionable- some 'anonymous sources' about 'chaos in the white House' but it definitely didn't reach the top upvoted post for that day. I get it: Shareblue definitely has a leftist leaning. But I don't think it's upvoted as much on this subreddit as people tend to think
Yep, you're just fulfilling the 'fully automated' portion of your Space Communism
Oh my god he actually demanded a safe space
Something very similar happened in Watson Hall at Carleton College, once.
Literally all of my players in my regular sci-fi game are women, and the majority of the wait-list are women too. Slightly over half of my players in my DnD game are women. I'd say over the course of all of the games I've run/played in about 75% of my players have been women. Not saying there isn't a gender divide but if there is I've never experienced it.
He said 'Hitler did nothing wrong'. At an earlier point someone came on the stream, said 1488, then began to recite 'the 14 words'.
From just a moment later in the interview: \n"STEPHANOPOULOS: You want to bring back policies like that? \n\nTRUMP:  No, I don't want to bring it back, George, at all. I don't like doing it at all. It's a temporary measure until our representatives, many of whom are grossly incompetent, until our representatives can figure out what's going on."\n\nSo despite saying that FDR was 'far worse', he followed that up by saying he'd hold his nose and implement comparable policies anyways. 
Yeah, control of the Colorado would be pretty contentious, but it is disingenuous to say that's 'out of state' water. It is in the state, it's just that half the river is out-of-state too. Anyhow, it is a bit ridiculous to say that the US government would recognize Cali's claims to the Colorado if they became independent, but the notion that they'd recognize their independence at all is ridiculous, TBH. I'm not pro secession, I just wanted to clear up our water usage habits- we don't heavily rely on other states for our water needs.
Horse may begin proliferating in the temperate lowlands and where ever roads are common, while goats, sheep, and dogs become more well known as ATVs, essentially.\n\nIf the dogs were bred for the size to be ridden, they would be fearsome war mounts- but they would also consume a terrifying amount of food. Perhaps wardogs eating the remains of enemy mounts would be a common sight on the battlefield.
Dude... I never said all trump supporters are racist. I never even implied it. I said that the dudes in question said really awful things. That's all.
That wasn't a ban, it slowed down visa processing and temporarily introduced new vetting procedures for one country in particular, and yes, it was criticized at the time, but it doesn't seemed to have gained as much attention because it was done without fanfare and the rollout of the temporary vetting procedures was relatively smooth afaik. No visa holders or green card holders were affected and I can't find anything about people not from Iraq being affected by the new Visa-processing measures.
Yeah my office is pretty liberal about pay info and all of my coworkers are very kind and trying to help me succeed- totally not what's i expected from my first Tech-related job. And probably the nicest thing they've done is that most of them let me know their salary, so that once I'm promoted I can negotiate from a position of knowledge. I'm only making 25k a year right now but with my coworker's help that should move up to 50k in January!\n\n
I don't see how it being a meme makes it less of a complete dick move to say that to a Jewish person or someone with Jewish family. And you really can't say that 1488 is a meme.
Don't know any specific location, but I could take a look for you, if you want.
Depending on how aware of this phenomenon people are, the deterioration of the soul might be assumed to correlate with the decay of the body, leading to a rise in mummification?
A podcast might work if it cuts out most of the dice-rolling and she can do something else at the same time. The Adventure Zone is hilarious and is generally cut down to 40min-1hr segments, aside from the first two episodes. If you or her like Monster Factory, or My Brother My Brother And Me, it's done by the same people (+ their dad).\n\nAlso for what it's worth it's not only funny but it becomes very emotional as it comes on. The DM also composes music to use as a soundtrack for parts of the game.
You mean a tl;dr?\n\ntl;dr: There was demonic invasion in the west that wiped out the western seaboard. Most of the western continent is desert. A big theocratic semi-rome conquered around that big inland sea, prosecuted a bunch of religions, then fell apart, leaving behind a semi-holy-roman-empire/league-of-nations. There's lots of land-based-trade and also dinosaurs because fuck it, I like dinosaurs. Also there are isolationist snow-elves in not-Tibet, some naga and selkies to the south, and a bunch of halfling and dwarven refugees. \n\n(Sorry if you didn't want a tl;dr, never heard the phrase 'gimme a Saitama' before so I just guessed.)
Well, here's an article addressing the amount that presidential visits have cost NYC in police overtime- that is to say, several hundred thousand per day. When the president visited NYC for three days to attend a UN General Assembly that cost approximately 1.27 million dollars in police overtime alone. It's somewhat safe to say that the costs of protecting the president-elects son and wife would go over that 400,000 mark rather quickly.\nhttp://observer.com/2012/11/campaign-and-fundraising-visits-cost-new-york-city-millions/\n\nFlying between NYC and DC on Airforce One costs somewhere around 300,000 dollars, and according to the New York Port Authority a presidential visit costs approximately 100,000 to prepare for. If Trump visits the city 'as often as possible' those costs do add up.\nhttp://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/14/donald-trump/trump-obama-fundraising-trip-cost-25-50-million/\n\nAnd of course, there's the difficult to ascertain number of how much is lost in productivity and inefficiency from traffic blocks and lost revenue, but that number would theoretically be a bit higher. Of course, security costs for the president's son and wife would be slightly lower, but not by much, and one does have to consider the high costs of adding additional security to Trump Tower. The building was not built with terrorist attacks or modern security in mind, and needs considerable work done.
When playing Mei, you want to be somewhat flanking, but not so much that you can't get to your team in a crisis (i.e. Winston Doing Murder On You). If you icewall, then heal yourself when you drop to 75%, you can usually buy enough time to get a teammember to help you burst him when he's frozen.
*COMMUNISM*
Well, this bill was introduced by a republican and had pretty wide bipartisan support. Efforts to repeal this regulation have been coming from both sides of the aisle over here for a while now.
Didn't trump at one point praise the japanese internment camps?\n\nJust looked it up. Not exactly praising it, but proposing a policy he says is comparable. http://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-defends-ban-on-muslims-no-different-from-how-fdr-treated-japanese/
To be fair, thousands, and in some cases millions are already coming out to say 'no'. Protesting is becoming a weekly activity for the friends I know, most of whom including myself never protested a day in our lives before. It's not much- though some protests like the Airport protests have already done good- but it's something. I'm not saying that protesting will necessarily do any good in the end, or that it won't fizzle out, but America does have a history of long, spirited protest against injustices. So that's a glimmer of hope, at least.
Obama specifically barred refugees from Iraq from entering the country, and that did meet with opposition at the time, especially for alienating Iraqi interpreters. Visa holders and green card holders we not effected? The two orders are different on both scale and scope.
The vast majority of California's water comes from inside the state. More if you consider the Colorado river part of the state, which it is; California has partial rights to the river.
Ah, gotcha, thanks.
I mean, it's also been unusually warm in Minnesota, at least. Unusually warm for Minnesota is still cold, though.
I think InADream was referring to clinton's transcripts, not trump's statements.
Perez doesn't seem that bad to me? Don't get me wrong, I'm really pro-Ellison (I live in his district, I kinda have to be) but so far I haven't seen anything about Perez that seems particularly poor on progressivism?
Robots can't sweat. #gotcha
I mostly only use PDFs, I like that I can ctrl+f through them, I like how many pages I can have up if I've got enough screen space, it's nice. The main problem is that I also use my computer to do a lot of other things, so sometimes it's difficult to juggle everything, which is where a physical book can help. There's benefits and downsides to each option.
I like it. Just curious: the river next to Enon, where's the moisture for that coming from? it looks like the mountain range it springs from is trapped between two deserts. Not a criticism, just curious. Also, what's the general scale?
You can't eat 'em and you can't make factories out of 'em.

There are two separate special types of marble one of my worlds. One absorbs light during the day and releases it at night, and the other 'absorbs darkness' at night and 'releases' it during the day. It's associated with the gods of the sun and the moon, and the form that releases light is used sometimes used for street lamps.\n\nThere's special oil associated with the god of the sun that causes any surface that is coated with it to softly glow for 2-3 hours. It's a byproduct of a large semi-religious weather-machine.
Tried to follow this guide for Caddo (https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/5ibbou/why_caddo_is_secretly_the_second_best_nation_in/) as Wichita. I messed up a whole bunch along the way, but I had a good time of it!
Of note, the Nazis targeted gay people as well. I wasn't taught about it when I learned about the holocaust in the states, but it's pretty horrifying the things that happened. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Holocaust
Ayyyyy\n\nYeah, most of the demons left but a decent amount stuck around, plus all of the banshees and malevolent ghosts they made from the spirits of the dead are still around. Fantasy-Western is exactly what I'm going for- we're doing a Kingmaker-style campaign. \n\nFor Sure, I wouldn't make a giant religion and not have heresies. Everyone claims to be the heir to theocratic-Rome and if someone disagrees with that, doesn't that make them heretical? Plus there's all the folks that worship the gods that not-rome didn't approve of, gods of generally-not-positive stuff like plagues and war, going off and being protestants and shit.\n\nThanks for the feedback! I'll definitely lean into those.
Huh. I honestly thought 40 was the floor. I mean, it still technically could be with a 3 percent margin of error, but that trend line is pretty harsh.
To be fair, that case had the highest views on any case presented before the court since that court started live-streaming it's hearings. Something like 100,000 people.
I mean honestly! It was so odd I thought I misheard at first, until the owner elaborated about how, to paraphrase, 'it wasn't a big deal or anything, girls just aren't as good at math as boys, so it's not as fun for them'. My brother uses it as a game for 3-5th graders at the afterschool program he works at! It's not that complex! \n\nI mean, the owner looked to be 60 at the very least, so maybe upbringing leaves a couple antiquated ideas, but *come on*, you run a game shop, just sell the damn game.
But... it's not the same thing? They slowed down the processing of refugee applicantions specifically in 2011. The language of Trump's ban is very specific on the subject of Visa holders, in direct contrast to Obama's policy which only dealt with individuals being resettled through refugee programs, and wasn't actually a universal ban? It was an introduction of additional vetting measures that slowed down the admission process- he didn't change visa policies, modify our long-term overall refugee programs, or include anything about providing preference based on religion. And Obama's policy only affected one state, not seven. 
That's fair. I thought think one of the other commenters here does make sense in positing it will likely reappear in a new form in several years if ISIS does end up collapsing, though.
Well, iirc the original Technocratic movement came about somewhere about 1900-1910 in America. It never really caught on but it was an idea that existed. And women's suffrage was a known concept at the time, it just hadn't ever reached critical mass.\n\nGot me on president of Somalia, though.
I agree! I prefer Ellison but that interview convinced me that Perez wouldn't be so bad. 
A few are, yes. Some aren't nearly this bad, but, y'know.
This would be the first politically motivated dismissal of an AG since Nixon.
Eh, GURPs isn't that bad. It's not elegant by any means, but it's a decent vehicle for Roleplaying if you don't intend to get into too much combat.
Oh yeah, fair. Probably wasn't necessary to point out the Women's Suffrage thing. I honestly don't know enough about the cultural history of the time to say anything regarding how much credit folks from that time ought to be given.
Ah, thanks
I don't know if this can be described as liberal tears considering that the host of the show agreed with her, and he was a republican politician. I mean I get if you also don't like him, just thought it was worth mentioning.
I mean to be fair I've been seeing an unprecedented level of rage and discontent and political discourse in pretty much every aspect of my daily life, including social media. It seems unlikely that won't translate to something, though how much 'something' would be is highly contentious. But most of my close friends are looking for ways to volunteer, where to donate, trying to figure out what they can do. Too little too late maybe, but it has implication for 2018.
Easiest way to get an idea of scale for yourself would be to decide what landmass you want to correlate to a real world landmass, and work from there. For example, if you want the western inland sea to be mediterranean sized, you can use that to judge the scale of the rest of the map.
Yeah, I was just wondering if anything looked too odd, out-of-place, or just not very aesthetically pleasing geographically. \n\nMy players are all new never-played-before and they're going off of the 5e manual, plus a couple of them have pretty pre-formed ideas of what their characters would be, so I hesitated to flesh the world out too much in case it contradicted their character concept. \n\nThat said, I do have some ideas about where the 'cool stuff' is, I was just away from my computer for a while after posting this.
I'm with you. I'm from California and I think that if we voted for an independent California it would be a disaster (though things would have to get a helluva lot worse before it came to that). And all of this 'the drought is over!' stuff is nonsense, we need to conserve until we've had multiple consecutive years of improved rainfall. 
Trying to westernize as natives or asian tech group isn't that bad compared to trying to get a decent Byzantine start. I would say getting a decent Byzantine start is much harder- usually during those playthroughs you're not playing a country that can't survive a loss. Byzantium can't survive a loss, early game.
(So uh, where did this meme start? i'm super out of the loop)
As I understand it, intent is important to determination of the legality of the law, and Rudy Guiliani is claiming that Trump asked him to help write a 'muslim ban'. That combined with Trump's statements on the campaign trail that he wants a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' (https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration) could inform the courts decisions on whether this is an illegal EO or not. The supreme court has determined that non-citizens do possess certain constitutional rights, such as the right to habeas corpus, but more specifically the law that Trump is likely drawing the power to enact this law from (the Immigration and Nationality Act) does have this specific provision: "no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence." I'm not sure whether any of these sticking points would lead to this EO being declared illegal or unconstitutional, but evidently AG Sally Yates had strong feelings on the manner. Trying to be relatively neutral on the matter and just explain why this is being opposed on legal grounds. Thanks. Let me know if I got anything wrong, I researched this for like 10 min tops.
The top ten least federally dependent states in the nation are all liberal (with the exception of Kansas). The top ten most federally dependent states are all conservative. Liberal states aren't sucking on the federal teat, they are the teat that conservative states suck on.
Two weeks ago a friend asked if I would run a game of DnD for them, I agreed but decided I wanted to use a new settings because my old ones had gotten a bit stale. Thus this: my first attempt at making a map using Photoshop! The goal was to include as many interesting geographic phenomena as I could fit. Not sure how well I succeeded in that sense. Everything's a bit vague about the actual world-building right now, because my players are making their characters today and I wanted to let them have as much input into what the world will turn out to be as possible. Still, I have a couple ideas what's going on.
That's actually not that accurate. While we do import some food, we export a whole lot more. We do import a large percentage of our energy (33%), but we import most  of our energy from pacific northwestern and southwestern states- not exactly flyover states, and we do pay for it, so we're not drawing anything away from their economies. We are taking steps to shore up that portion of our economy, and we're the nations lead investor in renewable energy aside from the federal government, by far. On top of that, we produce a tenth of the US's oil. Most of our water supplies come from within our borders; the Colorado river is obviously a point of contention, but it is technically on our border and Arizona, California and Nevada have multiple contracts regarding the division of water use between them- it would be dishonest to claim we're stealing that water away from another state. As for supplying and receiving goods, I don't see how that's not providing something to the union? I mean, it's a service done in California for other states and on behalf of other states. That's something that strengthens all economies involved. \n\nI mean, you're not entirely wrong in your theory. I can't find a good article on it, but I'd imagine that we important large amounts of metals and minerals from other states, seeing as we don't produce a ton ourselves. And if #calExit ever happened California's economy would be doomed for sure because of the inevitable trade war and the fact that would throw inter-state water compacts re: the colorado river into contention. But if you're arguing that California doesn't provide more for the union than it gets because it imports things, that's kind of a flawed argument because we pay for all of those things we're importing and that helps those economies that we import from as well. Buying minerals for high-tech manufacturing doesn't hurt the state we're buying the minerals from. So federal tax revenue is a pretty good way of assessing of how much we're giving vs getting because those resources from other states aren't gifts, they're purchases or transactions.\n\n(i mean i do object to the use of the term 'Dumbfuckistan'. imo that's condescending and not that useful to the discussion, though people can say what they want. just wanted to clear some things up about our resource usage.)
I was playing GURPs in a Space setting and for the finale session one of my players had to make a new character because her character had lost a leg the previous session and was out of commision. I basically said, "As long as your character is a soldier, they can be anything you want."\n\nShe forgot to name the character until five minutes before the session, and decided to call him 'Brad'. Brad proceeded to do nothing useful (damnit, Brad) until the very end, when he saved the day! ... by knowing how industrial air condition works.
There was a suggestion on Pod Save America that if your representative is refusing to hold a town hall, you should organize one yourself, publicize it to local media, and invite your representative to attend. Sounds like it might be tough to do, but pull it off and it's a potentially powerful image. Something to consider.
He literally said “What I’m doing is no different than FDR’s solution for German, Italian, Japanese, you know–”? I did not say they were comparable. I said that he said they were comparable, which he did.
The population of the west coast of the western continent was almost entirely killed off in an apocalyptic event 100 years before the game will be taking place. An army of demonic beasts and spellcasters crossed the sea, destroying cities and killing everyone within, raising some of those killed as malevolent banshees and other ghostly spirits. The western continent was already sparsely populated due to most of the inland area being desert, so at first the western countries stood alone, and isolated. It wasn't until the western countries had mostly fallen, and the army from across the sea continued eastward, that the nations of the eastern continent recognized the threat to their well-being. An coalition from many (though not all) of the nations of the west marched up the great rift  (where the brown-ish nation is) and faced down the army from across the sea. After a series of devastating battles, the army from across the sea was defeat, and its forces scattered. However, they left behind their warbeasts and the spirits of the dead, so most attempts to resettle the lands devastated by the invasion have ended in failure.\n

I mean the dude in question literally said 'hitler did nothing wrong'. That phrase is... pretty bad. And earlier people had been saying 1488 and reciting 'the 14 words'. 
A veteran black reporter asked him if he was intending to meet with the congressional black caucus regarding inner city crime, I believe? He responded in a way that indicated he didn't know what that was, then asked her, 'Are they friends of yours?' and suggested she set up the meeting herself.
The thing is, registering to vote already requires you to prove that you're eligible to vote. It requires access to the documents that you would use to acquire an ID- the main effect of requiring IDs is that it adds a new cost and time component to attempting to vote for populations where ID ownership is less common. Of note, many of the communities where ID ownership isn't common are the same areas where DMVs are either not present or understaffed, compounding the difficulty to vote for citizens in that position. It's a lot more difficulty for the voter with very little added security.
One off the top of my head that did it was the Fable series, and it wasn't particularly engaging then. Hopefully it'll be more engaging now.
The problem is that these restrictions on the office of the governor remove a lot of the tools that were supposed to be used against gerrymanderings.
That's fair. I wasn't really taught about that either. I'll do more research.
I'm with you there. Cali is in no way ideologically united enough on the concept of Secession to function as an independent nation, regardless of the logistics and politics of it all. Just wanted to clarify California water use trends.
sos?
You could have blood apple brewing be a very precise and controlled process- the less exposure to whatever compound in air that causes them to oxidize, the better. A truly fine blood apple wine would be mostly clear until it's opened, when it would rapidly turn red. Could be a plot point in a murder mystery.
Okay so! Rivers! It's extremely unlikely that the Maro river would split in that fashion. Rivers for the most part converge instead of diverge- when they do diverge it's usually at the edge of a delta, and the path of such a river is usually quite malleable. This is because a river will tend towards the lowest outlet possible, and over time, if two outlets of similar height are available, one will likely be eroded down to the point where it's lower, or the other will receive enough deposits to become too high. Deltas generally only have splitting because they are close enough to the shore and on a flat enough plain that these effects are mitigated- even then, deltas change shape and path relatively quickly. The only scenario from a real-world-geology standpoint that I can think of where this would make sense would be in the case of a major shift in a rivers path, and that would be extremely temporary. If you want Gento to have a strong geographic barrier around it, you can have the northern branch of the maro river be completely separate, flowing from the hills north of Maro lake- that way, you can use the hills as a natural barrier where there's no river. Alternatively, you could move Gento further out, and make it a proper island. \n\nI have no idea what the plate tectonics underneath all this are, so I can't say one way of the other whether these hills and mountains make sense. But they don't look awful.\n\nMy biggest problem is the lack of scale. My guess is that the area displayed is comparable to a map of Spain. Would that be accurate?\n\nEdit: Oh, one last thing. Human beings love water. Coasts, lakes, etc. But most of the human settlement seems to be inland, away from major water sources. Is there a reason for that?
Some good goofs and alternative history this part. Thanks for writing these AARs! Sad to see The FDR of post-civil-war America go, though.
Hey, just wanted to let you know that I absolutely love the Babel fish idea and I'm totally stealing that, thanks!
The setting's not that fleshed out but I can talk about cool weird shit.\n\n\nSince this is for dnd 5e, we've got to have an elven land. The northern portion of the east continent is going to be populated mostly by elves except on the forested portion on the west coast. That region is dominated by a massive plateau (and is already far north), so it's only got sparse forests, tundra, and glacial features. The small semi-circular lakes up there are massive sinkholes going deep down into the earth- far enough that it's somewhat warmer at the bottoms, so those lakes don't freeze as often as the surrounding water sources. Massive settlements are build around the edges and walls of these sinkholes. The three elven nations hold a pact of non-aggression- it is tradition (though not law) that it is not for elves to spill elven blood. But territorial disputes do occur, so on occasion these elves will hire the races of the lowlands to settle disputes among them.\n\n\nThe majority of dwarves and halfling resided in the west before great war (that I talked about above) took place. Refugees from these species have settled all over the lowlands. The orange, westfacing kingdom, 'Karascorum' took in many dwarves and gave them work in their mines, leading to the stereotype that dwarves are suited for mining work. \n\n\nThe lowlands- the areas surrounding that inland sea, the Sea of Averianis- are probably the most wealthy and prosperous lands in the world. The Sea of Averianis is shallow, with very few deep channels, which is bad for shipping but great for fishing. The land is fertile from dust blowing from the deserts of the west, and their eastern mountain ranges catch rain instead of blocking it. \n\n\nThe Averianis was named for a city-state-turned-empire that ruled much of it's shores, Averia. A theological oligarchy, Averia was founded on the belief that only some of the gods deserved the worship of the people. Gods of order, law, and prosperity were exalted, while gods of chaos, thievery, and death were cast down as unworthy. This belief caught fire, leading many to join Averian holy orders, and Averia used this international support to claim sovereignty over many states in the region, whose monarch generally either swore fealty, or fell. \n\n\nAveria as a multi-national empire only existed for about 150 years, but in that time Averian inquisitors ruthlessly prosecuted those who worshiped gods they deemed unworthy, causing mass exoduses from the region. Temples, monastaries, and monuments to these gods were melted down to fund the building roads and infrasture, or defaced/re-purposed to serve the worship of one of the gods the Averian priesthood approved of. \n\n\nThe Averian Empire was already crumbling as it reached it's 140th year. Infighting, bids from power from the nobility, and recurring droughts strained the region. That was when the city of Averia caught ablaze. The entire city burned down in a seemingly unnaturally swift and hot fire, leaving behind only the husks of the most resilient monuments. That signaled the end. While the Averian priesthood attempted to maintain their rule from a temple-city they had build in the western lowlands (the small light purple state with only one major city), there was no way for them to maintain control without the wealth of their capitol to support them. \n\n\nThe Averian empire existed several hundreds of years ago, but many kingdoms still call themselves the heirs to Averia. One kingdom, 'Grand Novani', has even gone so far as to reclaim the land that Averia was built on, and built a new city on it's ruins. In this age of relative balance between the various nations, many dream of conquest, so having such a political symbol is important, but has also made them many enemies.\n\n\nAveria also left behind a council of nations. Originally used as a forum for the leaders of the various subjugated nations to address the Averian priesthood, through chosen representatives (generally priests of their own nation), the forum remained after Averia fell. At first mostly defunct, the forum came back into power when the invasion of the west occurred, and it became necessary to coordinate the armies of many nations, as well as to form defensive pacts to prevent those who didn't commit to the war effort from attacking their weakened neighbors. The Forum of Velis is now a major element of the diplomatic interaction between the various nations, leading to the formation of complex alliances, and allowing the various leaders of the region to address the issue of pan-lowlands nationalism which became prevalent after the war. \n\n\nThe western continent is dominated by twin deserts, the Toroko and the Narani. The Narani, the eastern desert, is the more forgiving of the two. Somewhat fertile plains hug the coast, and one peninsula actually has year-round grasses and rivers. However, the ocean it borders is volatile, making for bad travel, and the peoples of that region do not have dealings with outsiders. The Torokoro recieves almost no rain year-round. High cliffs and rocky shores make good harbors extremely rare. The two lakes in the Torokoro have a very high salt content, and without any outflows have built up huge amounts of minerals and chemicals over the year. They're actually a very impressive sight- since they're populted mostly by bacteria, the water is colored a variety of bright hues. \n\n\nThis means that the best way to get to the fertile lands in the west is a long land voyage, up the Voroni Rift, a large valley between two mountain ranges which catches the few clouds that make it across the Torokoro, and along the ecological islands surrounding the Pari mountains, a chain of long-dead volcanoes. The journey is long, taking months before the veldt nearing the western ocean is reached. The lands of the Voroni Rift and the Pari mountains used to be quite wealthy, as the main trade route between the western coastal-facing nations and the Lowlands surrounding the Averian sea. However, after the nations of the western coast were all-but-wiped-out, very little trade has passed through, destroying the economies of these two countries. The rise of banditry as an alternative to poverty has only made those problems worse. \n\n\nAs far as general technological levels go, I'm thinking later 1500's europe in terms of weaponry- cannons and basic firearms exist, but haven't replaced plate and pike. However, naval technology is far behind the times- the seas of the region are very rough out in open ocean and many are quite shallow, so flat-bedded ships, galleys, and the like are much more common than vessels designed for deep water. \n\n\nUhhh, any other weird cool shit I've got. Selkies and Naga share a joint empire to the south- their outlying trading posts are those settlements out in the southern ocean.\n\n\nThe yellow-ish nation to the far south-west is populated by giants. Those circular-ish mountain regions are gigantic plateaus that form relatively lush ecological islands; the giants used to reside in all of these, but during the invasion of the west they lost most of these to the invading forces, leaving only the plateau they now reside on.\n\n\nThat large city in the purple nation, between the two continents, is actually under the mountains, populated mostly by dragonborn. It's an underground canal connecting the north to the south, and is generally much safer than the treacherous sound to it's east. Because there's not much wind within the canal, ships are pulled forward by teams of large trained animals and their dragonborn trainers. The legends say that it was originally hollowed out by the breath of a gigantic dragon. \n\nEdit: Sorry if a lot of this is very tropey, and the names are a bit wonky. This is all stuff I've come up with over the past day or so, and I don't want to go too far out there since my players are mostly first-timers.\n
So, about a year and a half ago, I was christmas shopping at a game near my grandma's house. I liked the place, they always had big war games set up, sample games running, that sort of thing. I was browsing their RPG manual selection when this guy comes in, walks up to the owner, and asks where he can find Catan, because his daughter wanted it. \n\nThe shop owner replied, "Oh, Catan's a bit complex for girls, let me direct you to something else." \n\nHe then directly the man to the store's selection of stuffed animals as a 'reasonable alternative'. I never went back to that store.
So! You can have you cake and eat it too, in regards to having the Artic and Desert environments nearby one another without making your scale too vast. Deserts relatively far north of the equator do occur- the Gobi,the Taklamakan, and the Atacama, for example. Deserts are entirely possible at any latitude, given a strong enough barrier to rainfall, like that mountain range you have in the west. So the bottom of the map doesn't have to be the equator. Alternatively, your planet can be smaller than earth- small planets actually work great for Fantasy. If gravity is lower, all these gigantic monsters and fantastic feats become even more plausible! \nEdit: Or, of course, you can shrink the rivers and add more features, that totally works too.\n
I mean, right now many people are protesting his cabinet picks, which is something you can legitimately protest.
But Keith Ellison hasn't mentioned the possibility that the primaries were rigged? I don't get how mentioning it and then retracting is worse than not mentioning it at all.\nDisclaimer: I prefer Ellison, but I don't mind Perez
Yeah I mean I had literally no experience coming into this and I'm getting promoted after three months so it's not so bad but I'd be the first to admit my current position isn't really that sustainable.
But didn't most of those arise in response to t_d? In the model of t_d?
This just really hammered home for me how corrupt Republicans are. I honestly don't believe this would've happened were it the other way around.
I'm sure that has happened on Tumblr- it's full of teenagers, things get twisted easily- but most of the rhetoric I've heard about truscum is basically saying that Disphoria exists, but isn't strictly necessary for someone to be trans. The frustration being that 'truscum' believe that there is a 'right' way to be trans. I think there's a conversation to be had there. Of course the idea that disphoria is fake is ludicrous, and I'm not denying that people have held that stance, but so far I haven't seen or met anyone of that opinion and that doesn't give me the impression it's that widespread. \n\nBut, of course, Tumblr is a highly factional social media service, so who knows what I'm missing.
She has a lot of experience with charter school advocacy but very little with general education. She failed to answer relatively basic questions about education policy and federal regulations during her hearings. Portions of her statements made as part of her confirmation hearings were plagiarized. And her plans for 'school choice', which she and Trump would project at 20 billion, would as I understand it require us to nearly completely gut current federal funding to pay for it. This plan would transfer more money to charter and online schools, which are unfortunately known for having difficulties with corruption and oversight in the US, while taking money away from public schools, particularly in rural areas where there aren't really any other options for a whole heckuvalot of Americans.\n\nNote: She doesn't have the authority to pursue these agendas entirely without oversight, to be fair, but it is a position from which to push these controversial and potentially very damaging proposals, which would, in my opinion, hurt the USA economy and potential for social advancement.
Great stuff! Good find.
Great post!\n\nTo add to it a bit, one should consider the possibility that nuclear devices may be used in the upper atmosphere to create an EMP that could seriously destabilize a massive region.\n\n> "... in July 1962 the Starfish Prime test damaged electronics in Honolulu and New Zealand (approximately 1,300 kilometers away), fused 300 street lights on Oahu (Hawaii), set off about 100 burglar alarms, and caused the failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai, which cut off the sturdy telephone system from the other Hawaiian islands. The radius for an effective satellite kill for the various prompt radiations produced by such a nuclear weapon in space was determined to be roughly 80 km. Further testing to this end was carried out, and embodied in a Department of Defense program, Program 437."\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion\n\nSo if the weapons they were testing back in the 60s were capable fusing electrical components 900 miles away from 20-30 miles up, imagine what a coordinated strike across an entire continent could do today. \n\nI don't know that there's a lot of precedent to make this claim, but if I were a nuclear power in the modern era, this is probably how I would conduct a nuclear strike against an adversary. Bringing down the power grid of a nation (or even a big city) will still cause a lot of death, confusion and suffering, but it will be the people who are unable to get clean water, people without refrigeration, people without means of communication and severely restricted travel capabilities that would be causing a great deal of the chaos on the ground, thus forcing the state to step in and assist - consuming their resources internally for what would likely be a significant amount of time. \n\nThe response of the state (which would almost certainly be in a state of emergency or possibly in some kind of martial law after being attacked like this) to this catastrophe could also potentially cause great dissent within the already suffering populace - as opposed to having them rally against an enemy that just attacked them overtly with hellish bombs. 
>People in rich neighborhoods on the other side of town, “they don’t have to think about water,” she added. “But for us it is something we think about all day, every day.” [....] Ms. Guzmán’s family earns $600 a month. They ultimately have to spend more than 10 percent of that income on water.\n\nNot only is it unsustainable and insanely wasteful - but the people that are going to suffer the most because of it are the people who can do the least to change anything about the situation ~~without resorting to revolution~~.
> How does it affect you psychologically?\n\nI'm just shy of 30 now, and I think I went through a few different phases of dealing with the reality of collapse when I started to realize just how overpopulated and resource-driven the planet (and more specifically modern society) is somewhere around age 20. I shifted from angry/sad that people wouldn't even attempt to slow down their consumption and procreation to come together and see themselves as a more collective entity sharing finite resources, to something like more akin to pessimism or apathy for the species, to eventually arrived at a place of general (if grudging) acceptance when I was able to internalize the fact that people are basically always going to look out for themselves and their immediate best interest even if it destroys everything around them and that there really isn't enough time left to actually 'fix' this problem or correct this mindset among our population. It's accepting that the world (at least a world fit for human survival) has terminal cancer, essentially. We all go through these stages of acceptance, I think. One way or another. \n\n> How have you changed your lifestyle, behavior and beliefs around the idea of collapse?\n\nMy wife and I definitely prep more and more as time goes on. We both actually ended up getting pretty decent jobs a couple years back now, and I feel like our lifestyles have become intertwined with that sort of 9-5 existence now. We don't necessarily like this fact, but having the resources to actually get out of debt while still having the ability to go camping and hiking and acquire tools and equipment while living relatively decently by our standards has been a really nice change compared to moving from shit job to shit job, city to city every year or so. I mention all that because I don't know that we'd appreciate all of this new-found 'luxury' as much as we might if we didn't accept that some day (likely not too terribly long from now) that those basic amenities won't be available to us. Today, I appreciate every hot shower, good meal and flush of the toilet. It reminds me of a quote from Achaan Chah that I'm pretty sure I've seen posted on here before, but I'll gladly share it again-\n\n>He motioned to a glass sitting to one side of him. “Do you see this glass?” he asked us. “I love this glass. It holds water admirably. When the sun shines on it, it reflects the light beautifully. When I tap it, it has a lovely ring. Yet for me, this glass is already broken. When the wind knocks it over or my elbow knocks it off the shelf and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‘Of course’. But when I understand that this glass is already broken, every minute with it is precious.”\n\nI also tend to lean on the stoic philosophers for gems of wisdom for dealing with hardships. I'd highly recommend Meditations by Marcus Aurelius to basically anyone who is struggling. (You can easily find a PDF copy online if you just search for it - the book is literally ancient but still so applicable to modern life - do yourself a favor and glance through it sometime, you won't regret it). \n\n> Do you talk with friends and family about it? What are their reactions?\n\nWith friends and coworkers, I tend to tread more lightly. I don't talk about prepping, though I do tend to interject collapse talk through the vector of pessimistic humor - the gentle reminder that humanity essentially dug its own grave in the 1970s when the rulers at the time opted to stay the course or rapid industrialization as opposed to radically restructuring society to allow it to survive long-term. But yeah, I don't want to be Debbie Downer to too many people when the reality is that I know that my telling them how shitty things could get (and how soon it could happen) will be tuned out so that they can go on living their normal lives. From my experience, people who genuinely seek the truth will come to this realization on their own - and that it's better to foster a community of support for people who have accepted this reality as opposed to trying to create that community by informing those around us of the reality of their situation. It's just too difficult of a pill for some people to swallow, and they don't appreciate having our 'bad vibes' thrust upon them. \n\n\nWith family I'm more candid. My elderly parents like to talk politics (and so do I) but I feel like they tend to be short-sighted with regard to the reality of climate disaster and economic collapse as well as the unnecessary suffering that can be caused by unfettered capitalism and human exploitation. Instead they get caught up in whatever the issue du jour is. As I mentioned, they're on the older side of their 60s, so their general tone regarding potential collapse is 'well at least we'll be dead by then'. I feel like they (and perhaps Boomers in general) can't quite accept the notion that things will inevitably get worse for everyone around them - because throughout their entire lives (at least for my folks) things have gotten (or at least felt like they've gotten) consistently better (jobs, houses, boats, finances, etc.) though for me and my wife and our friends it's been a constant struggle, and we're all still stuck paying off student loans for at least another year or two before we can really justify looking to buy a house and starting a homestead project.\n\nI've rambled enough for today though - thank you for starting this thread and providing an outlet for us to share a bit. I hope you all have a good day today.
I liked Escape from L.A. a bit more I think, but they're both good movies - and becoming more and more topical as the world gets more and more crazy. Fun fact - the protagonist from most of the Metal Gear video games is based largely off of Snake Plissken from these movies. Snake even uses the alias Iroquoi Plissken in MGS2.\n\nThough to the matter at hand, I think vanceco was trying to say that post-collapse aristocracy probably still wouldn't have the medical and technological means necessary to install and maintain a battalion's worth of small explosives wired to radio equipment surgically implanted in the skulls/bodies of their private security force. The comment that those things 'would have to be real' probably related less to the fact -as you rightly pointed out- that these devices (or something roughly equivalent) already exist and have existed for some time, and more to the point that these post-collapse monarchs would require skilled doctors, RF experts, someone decent at demolitions, and people capable of making medical-quality devices in order to see this idea though - and that's before we even talk about where the materials for this equipment would be coming from - assuming of course they aren't already stockpiling 'compliance collars' or something like that at their posh summer bunker compounds that klum was daydreaming about.
In my lab setup at home I run kali as a VM off a laptop using VMware Player. I have vulnerable VMs set up on an ESXI server.  The ability to do snapshots can save a TON of time depending on what you're working on.\n\nI haven't experienced anything about kali in a VM that would make me not recommend it. In fact I think Offensive Security recommends people to use the VM version of kali when they take OSCP, but I haven't checked out their site too recently, could have changed, but yeah, a VM is fine in my experience.\n\n
I do have to wonder how difficult it would be to determine where a device like that was launched from and what the immediate response would be. \n\nI would assume that there would be enough camera/radar-equipped satellites and facilities around the globe that one could feasibly track the missile's point of detonation back to wherever it originated, but I don't know the extent of what the world's powers are capable of within this context, given that these detonations (at least as far as the US and USSR test back in the day) were something like 20-30 miles up, and most commercial aircraft fly at around 6 miles or so - though given that they've tested the effects of this kind of attack before I would assume that there is some sort of anticipatory measure for an assault like this.\n\nThe point about rallying the population could play out quite differently as well if there really was no way to get outside information (i.e. radio towers are all screwed up, internet and data-center lines are fried, cellphones made useless) we'd only be getting information from sources that could somehow get information from communication devices that were still functional - in this case that would probably be government workers delivering aid to communities - but even then it's hard to say how much the people on the ground would really know. For most people it would probably just be the day that all the lights went out, and they probably wouldn't know much more about it for quite awhile. The more immediate things in life would end up taking precedence, I think.\n\nHistory.com actually has an interesting passage related to the largest recorded solar flare and the effect it had on telephone operations back in the day.\n\nhttp://www.history.com/news/a-perfect-solar-superstorm-the-1859-carrington-event\n\n>That night, telegraph communications around the world began to fail; there were reports of sparks showering from telegraph machines, shocking operators and setting papers ablaze. All over the planet, colorful auroras illuminated the nighttime skies, glowing so brightly that birds began to chirp and laborers started their daily chores, believing the sun had begun rising. Some thought the end of the world was at hand, but Carrington’s naked eyes had spotted the true cause for the bizarre happenings: a massive solar flare with the energy of 10 billion atomic bombs. The flare spewed electrified gas and subatomic particles toward Earth, and the resulting geomagnetic storm—dubbed the “Carrington Event”—was the largest on record to have struck the planet.\n\nEver since I learned about the Carrington event, I've wondered how well shielded places like datacenters are. \nIt's somewhat difficult to imagine the endless miles of cat5 and telephone wire packed into floors, ceilings and walls in buildings across the world that could potentially burn up in the event of a solar flare or large EM disbursal. \n\nIt's a tough event to prep for in any case, military or natural. I know I don't have anything packed away in Faraday cages that I could use after a significant EM event, and I doubt that very many among the prepped community do either.  
Agreed - it is unfortunate how large a role Facebook plays in the lives of so many people. The ability to manipulate what people see in their feeds, as well as track where else they're going online, what they're buying, who they're talking to, what they're talking about, their phone's location in real time and so many other things - is probably the largest blackmail discovery tool ever created. \n\nLike, if any government ever demanded that its citizens wear a tracking device complete with microphones, GPS and cameras on it that report everything they see and hear back to a govt. datacenter people would (at least I hope) freak out about how oppressive that is and avoid carrying the device whenever possible - but if you let people opt in with the shiny carrot of social media and instantaneous communication (things that in and of themselves are not necessarily bad) then suddenly everyone *needs* one in order to essentially participate in modern society.\n\nIt's scary how much of our personal information we can give up without even realizing it, and how absurdly valuable that information is. That information has made Zuckerberg a multi-billionaire (56B to be accurate - I just checked - Bill Gates has 85.3B by comparison) within, what, 10 years or so? \n\nDoes anyone else here think that perhaps oligarchs and plutocrats aren't the best rulers? I really wish our societies would start seeing that as a disqualifier for positions of power.  
This is actually a really good place to start. 
I'm not sure if you're being satirical or not... But on the chance that you aren't, there's a bunch more that klondike didn't mention... \n\nFrom Guatemala to Iran, banana republics to the Bay of Pigs incident, hell even Vietnam, hell, even Iraq - the US has an extensive history of 'meddling' in other countries affairs -usually by providing weapons, training and intel to manufactured rebel groups who will be more amicable to our interests than the current govt.- if it serves the interest of the government or a significantly powerful corporate entity within the US. \n\n >and none of it was even illegal. Immoral, sure, but that's called politics.  \n\nIt honestly isn't my intent to offend, but not only is the statement that it isn't illegal not true, even if it was, that's a pretty poor standard to hold nation states to... I mean, to the Russian govt. annexing Crimea was probably 'legal' to them, or easily made legal after the fact. Cutting gay people's heads off can be perfectly legal in Saudi Arabia, but that isn't a reason to just shrug and say it's just politics. \n\nThe horrible things that (presuming you're from the US) our country has done shouldn't be shrugged off so easily. If we can't acknowledge the unfortunate realities that our govt. has created for others around the globe than we're no different from Kellyanne Conway peddling our 'alternative facts'. \n\nI wanted to include a source with this reply that tries to make this point succinctly without coming off as propaganda from some media site. I think I've found that in the Wikipedia article that covers the assassination attempts made on Castro over the years.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro\n\nIn the article, they list the number of attempts made against Castro sorted by president and era.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower (1959–1961): 38\n\nJohn F. Kennedy (1961–1963): 42\n\nLyndon B. Johnson (1963–1969): 72\n\nRichard Nixon (1969–1974): 184\n\nJimmy Carter (1977–1981): 64\n\nRonald Reagan (1981–1989): 197\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush (1989–1993): 16\n\nBill Clinton (1993–2000): 21\n\nSome of these attempts are downright silly - stuff like exploding cigars and pens loaded with syringes containing some nicotine-based toxin called Blackleaf 40. Others are just contracted mafia hitmen and attempts made using more traditional methods, but all the same, you can read about it if you want. My point is that the US is far from an innocent nation - that's something I'd like to try to change, which is why I support a political revolution. I assume that you do as well, being that you're posting here. It benefits neither of us to underestimate the more unsavory elements/history within the American govt, and it certainly benefits those existing powers to be free of deeper scrutiny. \n\nIn any case, I hope this was somewhat informative, even if you were just being silly :P\n\nTake care!

I claim ignorance on most of what obama did because I wasn't paying too much attention. However I do believe that Trump has already gone above the law in multiple ways. I'm sure if you dig around you can make cases of this for Obama or any president really, but this after about a month of being in office.\n\nAlso Trump is fixing problems that don't exist he constantly makes outlandish claims such as like 3 million people voting illegal. There is no evidence of this this isn't a problem that needs to be fixed it's a distraction. This kind of governance worries me

I have the affinity, very nice guitar. Tuners kinda suck, but it plays really nicely and does not sound too bad either. 
Really depends on the college too. I would not have brought a nice amp and guitar to the dorms at the University of Florida, stick with a decent beater and an inexpensive solid state amp (vox, fender, blackstar all make good ones).
I have the same guitar. The finish is pretty thin, should sand off pretty quickly. Then the painting, idk. Personally, I would just use spray paint or roll some paint on, but there are many tutorials showing how to get all fancy. And consider Inverness Green, like surf green but not nearly as common. \n\nI have a fender strat, gibson sg, this one is still my main go-to guitar to practice on, feels great. 
Yes it does.

I've got the 1991 GMT version with the gold bezel and leather strap, I was thinking about selling it, let me know if you want some pics.

Because the universe and how it works implies, to me at least, a greater force, the glory of God is all around us. But human religions' attempts to define and codify the divine into a set of rules are no more than reflections of our humanity and our hubris  and human-centric beliefs (desire for ultimate justice and rewards, a sympathetic listener, an ultimate authority to appeal to, plus many others),  not actual messages from the creator.

Another lefty here, good luck with your search. Be patient and you will find what you are looking for. I bought a Gibson SG 70s Tribute this year on reverb, probably my nicest guitar. I am not sure about linking to auctions, so I will suggest you just go on there and look around. They have a nice worn natural finish (beautiful) 60s Tribute with P90s for around $700, for example. No white ones though.

Older lefty here, learned to play games on an AIM 6502 and later IBM XT (with mouse). If there was a way to make a mouse left-handed back then, I didn't know about it and my Dad certainly would not have let me messed around with the settings anyway, everyone in the house used that computer. So computing/gaming right-handed never an issue here.\n\n
Florida is a lot more old people and rednecks than hispanics. She will not win Florida. I do not want Trump to win Florida, but realistically, she had the South locked up for the primaries, but in an actual election, it is going Red.

I've enjoyed all of them, starting with the first one (although at the time played way more Colonization, loved and still love that game). I think Civ 5 is pretty darn good, but I have a special spot for that one where you could send a lawyer to hassle your enemies (maybe Call to Power or CtP II)? 
Exactly. I believe we have another Nixon scenario here. We will all be looking around after election night saying "How did Trump win when no one I know voted for him?"  I am mentally adding about ten points to polls.\n

Hi Fellow lefty, as "I only post here" said, you are likely\n buying online, site unseen. For punk at least, a humbucker is helpful. My usual recommendation for cheaper electrics is the squier affinity tele, $160-199. I play it, very nice. But no humbucker. I see you can get an Epiphone G-400 Pro with coil tap for a little over 350. Honestly, I would go with that. (edit: I see others are recommended\n the same thing...sorry I didn't notice).\n
I have the blackstar id core 10 as well, easy to dial in a decent tone, nice sound for a little box (have not tried the patching software).

Yes, this one's been on the roadmap since launch. And there are more on the roadmap after that.
Right now there are 700K coins. They generate 50 coins every ten minutes or 2.6 million coins per year, until their first halving after four years.\n\nSo a year from now there will be 3.3 million coins, or 4.7 times as many as now. The market cap has to increase more than 4.7X or you lose money. That means over $100 million a year from now, up from $21 million now. If they go up 10X you just double your money.\n\nThe market cap was under $8 million on Dec 1, and over $20 million now. But look at the coin price: $70 on Dec 1, $48 on Jan 1, $40 on Feb 1, $29 now. That's the inflation; each coin has a smaller and smaller share of the market cap.\n\nPersonally I'm waiting until there's less headwind; as time passes the inflation rate goes down. Coincidentally that probably also means waiting until after Metropolis, when it'll become possible to put the privacy tech from both monero and zcash on Ethereum; it'll be interesting to see if that changes the market.
The distributed, incentivized data storage layer is Swarm, which is independent of the Serenity release, and could be deployed today if it were ready. Right now there's a live proof of concept but they're still adding important pieces of it.\n\nSwarm has been part of the Ethereum vision since the early days. There are plenty of other projects with similar visions, like IPFS, which seems to be the furthest along at the moment.
I hesitate to nitpick something that good, but it'll scan perfectly if you remove "Shell."
I wonder if this would keep Europeans ICOs from blocking U.S. contributors.
Helium-3 fusion is aneutronic. If we manage that, it could end up being even cheaper than solar+storage. It certainly wouldn't take up as much space as large-scale utility solar.
Some of them already try to block U.S. contributors, to keep out of trouble with the SEC. It's not necessarily effective but they do what they can.  What I'm asking is whether they'll have to stop making the attempt, in which case they'll be at more risk of SEC action.
Just because something says there's a 70% chance of something happening, doesn't mean there's a 100% chance of it happening.
Holy crappamoly, thanks so very much, I have no idea what to do with the gold, but i'll find out!\n\nHave a great day and thanks!
In the latest Mauve paper, Vitalik had the minimum down to 32 ETH.\n\nAs for forks, I think the community strongly supports PoS, and the scalability it will enable. Miners might want to keep mining the old chain, but it seems more likely they'd just switch to another coin. Maybe ETC, I think a lot of PoW diehards went over there anyway.
Hah great video. At first I thought a big beefy guy wasn't the best to rebut that claim but he figured out a way.\n\nMy 95-lb elderly mother who walked with a cane used to shoot an AR-15.
So you're claiming that because of people's irrational biases, even though people think an ETF approval is unlikely, the Bitcoin price won't go up if it happens? I think that's an unlikely outcome.\n\nAnd I don't think Kahnemann's work suggests it at all. You're just assuming that everybody's thinking solely in terms of wealth, to such an extent that they completely discount the risk; there are probably lots of people worried about the risk of the ETF being rejected. If people were as optimistic as you say, the prediction markets would give much higher odds of approval.
Current location of every object and player, for starters.

I trust a licensed exchange more than I trust governments not to destroy digital currencies backed by gold/fiat, given that they've done that several times before.
Looking at their [white paper](https://www.boscoin.io:4433/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/boscoinwhitepaperv20170202.pdf), the smart contract language seems to be just a configuration of canned functionality. It's hard to imagine it working for arbitrary smart contracts, doing the sort of creative things people are doing on Ethereum. But they don't go into detail, they just give a couple examples.\n\nThe paper they link, [Modeling Bitcoin Contracts by Timed Automata](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.1861v2.pdf), might be interesting for the people working on formal verification of Ethereum contracts.\n\nWe could easily implement their voting scheme with an Ethereum contract; that's pretty much what TheDAO was. But crowdsourced automatic governance of the protocol itself is a hard problem...see Vlad Zamfir's comment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPQfWTizYpg&t=34m57s).
Ledger Nano S with MyEtherWallet for the interface. Make sure you don't mistype the URL (there are scam versions), and verify your transactions on the Nano's display.\n\nIf you want a software wallet/node, Parity is nice. Use --warp and you're up and running in about 30 seconds. On the Mac I'd recommend installing with homebrew instead of their installer, which makes it practically impossible to shut down.\n\nDon't store your whole stash in a software hot wallet, but Parity's fun to play with, and it gives you your own node instead of relying on MEW's. I don't think it supports Ledger yet but that's probably coming.
At the moment there's no good way.\n\n- You can use block hashes for small amounts, but if the payout is large then miners will manipulate the hashes.\n\n- You can use Oraclize, but then you're just relying on a centralized provider...also fine for small amounts but insiders might be too tempted by large payouts.\n\n- You can have everybody submit hashes, then submit preimages at the end and you xor them all together, but that's even easier for miners to manipulate just by blocking different combinations of hashes.\n\nA really good method would be Dfinity's random oracle using threshold signatures, but that's new crypto and nobody's implemented it on Ethereum yet. Maybe the new precompiles in Metropolis will help.
You too :)
I think fiat-backed currencies from banks are going to have all kinds of restrictions to keep them out of trouble with the government. 
I agree that using ether for just gas doesn't support any significant value, and I'm not a fan of ICOs that launch their own coins when they could just as well use ETH.\n\nHowever, ICOs are part of the ether GDP, so they contribute to ether value (see my top-level comment here). And to whatever extent they build things that attract new users to the platform, they also contribute indirectly.
Violates mass conservation at any given time but not across all of spacetime. If you travel from 2017 to 2001, then 2017 loses the same mass that 2001 gains.\n\nAnd that does satisfy mass conservation because there's no absolute time anyway, the current time depends on your reference frame.
It's harder to get net power from helium-3 fusion than it is from pure deuterium fusion.\n\nThe waste product of deuterium fusion is helium-3.\n\nInstead of sifting through millions of tons of lunar rock to harvest a little helium-3, we can just use the abundant deuterium in the oceans to make it, and produce energy in the process.\n\nFusion startup Helion is attempting a hybrid reactor using both fuels. They say their combination of D-D/D-He3 fusion would produce only 6% of its energy output as neutron radiation. 
Or on services that support it, a yubikey.
Why do you like high inflation? It just dilutes your share of the market cap.\n\nNot saying it's a bad investment necessarily, and I like zcash as a project, but figure out what market cap you think is likely in your time frame, and then divide it by the number of coins that will exist then and see whether that puts the coin price higher or lower.
I tend to agree overall. As far as inflation goes though, it's under 13% annually, which isn't all *that* high...if for example you thought that in the absence of inflation, ETH price would quadruple over the next year, then with inflation you take 4/1.13 = 3.5X higher a year from now. That's assuming linear inflation, not taking the "ice age" into account.\n
That's really interesting, thanks! I'm going to start measuring oral temp too. A 36F bath is definitely more than I could handle right now.\n\nHave you tried checking blood pressure? I'm curious what the effects of all that breath holding and muscle tensing would be.\n\n*What Doesn't Kill Us* talks about a meditation where you close your eyes, pay attention to the random colors you see, and visualize them extending all through your body. It says that's the key to immune system control. Is that covered in the 10-week course?
Sure if you run the game on servers that works. Then what do you plan on using Ethereum for?
Right now one of our problems is *deforestation*. We'll have to put a stop to that before we can even consider trees as a way to reduce CO2.\n\nAnother problem is that existing forests are dying of drought, disease, heat stress, and forest fires. Some are turning into net carbon emitters, and that's only going to get worse.\n\nAside from all that, we couldn't bring CO2 down to preindustrial levels by planting trees, unless we converted over a large portion of the land we currently use for agriculture. The carbon scrubbing machines being developed would use about a thousand times less space.\n\n
Specialized expertise. If I want to bet on the answer experiments will find to an unresolved scientific question, for example, I'd rather bet on what a small group of experts in the field thinks about it, than on what the general public thinks about it. The general public will base its views on media reports which are notoriously inaccurate on scientific issues.\n\nIf I want to bet on the outcome of an election, then there's no need for specialized judges.
I'd say there are plenty of examples: any corporation that has figured out how to make money by selling something that benefits the world in some way.\n\n
It just aggregates information from elsewhere. Any given article is as reliable as its sources. Most articles are pretty well sourced though.\n\nOne of the best things about NBF is its commenters, a fair number of whom have physics and engineering backgrounds and skeptical tendencies.
His [website](https://www.expii.com/) is already live, and has quite a bit of content. Mostly at high school level so far. I hope it expands into rapidly into more advanced math, it looks really cool.\n\nThe video reminded me of the AI tutor tablet in *Diamond Age*. But that one was supposed to be restricted to elites; this one gets better the more people use it.
Yep definitely. There *might* be staking pools so you don't have to keep a node online.
One idea I've seen is to have two keys, one that runs the protocol and the other that's needed to withdraw funds, which would be your hardware wallet. A successful attacker could still make you lose money but at least couldn't directly steal it.
> branched away \n\nI see what you did here.
You're not missing anything. It was [12 words](https://medium.com/dfinity-network-blog/a-guide-to-making-seed-contributions-to-dfinity-stiftung-and-generating-dfn-keys-d3dd702c4f4d#.l7a5u9z22). It's probably using BIP39. I googled and so far the best I've found is a reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4z0bb0/is_bip39_12word_seed_safe/d6rryux/) claiming that BIP39 with 12 words provides 128 bits of entropy, which is plenty to be safe. 
Verifying that votes are accurate *strengthens* democracy. It's the people who refuse recounts who weaken it.
How hard is it to put verified code on etherscan when using libraries?
Same coins. If you want to stake them, you'll have to lock them into the staking contract and keep a node online.
If you're familiar with Bitcoin, the easiest explanation is that it's like Bitcoin, except you can put scripts on the network which can hold money and data, and make updates and move money around according to whatever rules you programmed. A basic crowdfunding takes about a page of code. You can make your own coin by deploying a script that implements a ledger, build a voting system, whatever.\n\nIt's not so much about renting distributed computation on servers, though there are people attempting to build services like that on top of Ethereum.
The cap-and-refund looks like what I proposed [here](http://www.blunderingcode.com/fairtokensales/), with Solidity code. (And here's the reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/57cled/fair_token_sales_low_caps_no_lockouts/).)\n\nBranche made a slight [variant](https://github.com/DES-simeon/Fairsale/blob/master/fairsale.sol) of this for their token sale, so their version of the code was actually used live. (I think the sale didn't work out very well; hopefully that wasn't due to the crowdsale structure.)
The exponential drop in inflation is just a temporary measure to help along the move to proof of stake; if we don't get proof of stake soon enough, the drop will be postponed. So I don't think it's valid to project it out through the next century. We'll either give up on PoS and continue linear inflation, or we'll switch to PoS and have somewhere between zero and 2% inflation from then on.\n\nTypo: counterfit -> counterfeit\n\nAnd we've been calling it "the Flippening" :)
Also be sure to properly secure your Coinbase account: strong password, and 2FA with Google Authenticator rather than SMS.

Prediction markets are giving ETF approval a 30% chance. That suggests neither outcome is fully priced in. If a surprise ETF approval would have taken it up $100, right now it'd be up $30, so approval would take it another $70 and rejection down $30.
He's assuming a market cap of $1.8 trillion if Ethereum takes over, and multiplying that by his estimated 0.7% probability of it happening.
Cool, yep the chat api is what I was asking about. I actually didn't realize you also support regular websites!
On many sites it adds usability. I keep javascript blocked by default and I'm generally happier that way. For one thing it gets rid of a lot of annoying popups telling me to subscribe or turn off adblock. \n\nA surprising number of sites need javascript to display images, but if I really need to see them it's a couple clicks to whitelist.
I've yet to see a good description of how they plan to put medical records on a blockchain but keep them private.\n\nArticle's right that the industry is very conservative. In the early 2000s Tim Berners Lee wrote a big article about how the semantic web was going to make healthcare EDI obsolete. At the time, many health insurance companies were just starting to migrate *to* EDI. I was at a startup that worked with them on that.
And now Bayer lobbies for pesticides that are killing off bees, because who cares about mass starvation when quarterly profits are at stake.
We already have less harmful alternatives, and Europe already banned three neonicotinoids. I don't know whether Europe's efforts are sufficient, but we do know they're an improvement over what we're doing in the U.S.
I agree. There's a simple formula for the value of a currency: it's the value of goods and services traded for the currency (the GDP), divided by the [velocity of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money). The more people use ether as money, the more valuable it will be. \n\nSomething the Bitcoin people did really well in the early days is talk lots of merchants into accepting bitcoins, and it worked out really well for them. People also use bitcoins to store value but it's the commerce that builds the foundation of that value; without it, you're just storing meaningless numbers. \n\n(Stored bitcoins reduce the velocity of money, so they do contribute to the price if you have GDP. Price = GDP/velocity...increasing GDP and decreasing velocity both increase the price, but if there's no GDP then velocity is irrelevant.)\n\nOne project I'm messing around with is an [Ethereum shopping cart](http://www.blunderingcode.com/shopping-without-servers/) which, once we have Swarm and Whisper, will let you set up an online store without having any sort of server at all.
It definitely absorbs a huge amount of CO2, but also a lot of it gets eaten and converted back to CO2. It used to be all this was in balance so we had stable CO2 levels, but I don't know what the situation is now.
If all the transactions in a channel go one direction, it doesn't reduce their fees at all, since the total transfer happens when the channel closes. If funds move back and forth then there's only a fee on the net transfer.\n\nAnother problem is that it's easy to make a token contract which is backed by DGX, and lets you transfer tokens to anyone with no fee. Then there's no fee except when you move DGX in and out of this wrapper contract, and there's not much reason for anyone to move it out unless they want to actually redeem the gold.\n\nDGD holders will also get a demurrage fee, but last I checked that amounted to a lot less than what they were estimating from transaction fees.\n
Hmm, that's encouraging. I haven't done ice buckets on my feet yet, maybe I'll start with that and work my way up.
Yikes. We really need a better approve() function. Either the suggested version, or one that applies a delta. Luckily it probably wouldn't be a problem for interaction with other contracts; it'd just require a new UI.
It's unlikely that someone could access your Ledger after stealing it, especially if you use an 8-digit random PIN. They have three attempts then the Ledger wipes itself.\n\nIf someone gets into your safe deposit box with the seed words you might be in trouble, but you can add a passphrase to that. (Right now it's a bit techy, they're planning to make it easier.)\n\nAdding multisig might still be a good idea. One caveat though: the Ledger Nano S displays the recipient address and ether amount, but for interacting with contracts it just warns you that there's data. So you won't get verification on secure hardware of exactly what you're doing with your multisig wallet.
Having staked ETH is analogous to having hashpower. You're not actually looking for hashes.\n\nThere are different approaches but in Ethereum's, your node bets your stake on which blocks will be accepted, and the blocks which are bet on by the most stake are the ones accepted. So basically you're betting on what everybody else will do. \n\nYou start with low-confidence bets that don't lose much if you're wrong. Then you see what everybody else does, and switch to high-confidence bets that win more if you're right. Follow the protocol and you come out profitable on average. (It's not zero-sum because there's new money coming in from fees and inflation.)
Metropolis will provide the infrastructure to support post-quantum signatures. The actual signature algorithms will still need to be implemented, I don't know how complicated that will be.
VR: in my reality I own Excalibur and keep it in a castle on top of Mt. Fuji. In your reality you own Excalibur and keep it hidden in a cave on Mt. Everest.\n\nMetaverse: there's one consistent reality and only one of us gets to own Excalibur.\n\nBlockchains are really good at making reality consistent.
The wallet stores your private keys, which you use to sign transactions from your addresses. You can make as many copies of your wallet as you like, and should definitely back it up.\n\nA very safe noob-friendly storage method is to use a [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s) hardware wallet. You store a paper backup in a safe place, like a safe deposit box. The Ledger has a pin, and if some steals it and tries three wrong pins, it wipes itself. You can plug the Ledger into any computer and use [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) as a user interface. It doesn't matter if the computer is riddled with spyware because the Ledger never reveals the keys to the computer, and you verify transactions on the Ledger's own display.
So you're thinking, objects can have real-world value so ownership needs the extra consensus protection from the blockchain, while other data we're willing to rely on the servers? Seems like a decent tradeoff. 
Right, best to do that on a computer that never goes online. And as long as there are Ledgers available it's better to restore onto another of those.
A hacker can call the phone company and easily talk them into transferring your phone number to the hacker's phone. Kraken wrote a long scary [article](http://blog.kraken.com/post/153209105847/security-advisory-mobile-phones) about it. SMS is [also](https://securityintelligence.com/whats-wrong-with-sms-authentication-two-ibm-experts-weigh-in-on-the-nist-recommendation/) inherently insecure, and easily targeted by malware. [NIST](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/nist_is_no_long.html) no longer recommends using SMS for authentication.
That's true. But if people know it's coming for sure, then *that* will get priced in. A 100% chance of future gain is worth more than a 30% chance of future gain.
If you're going to have a metaverse, as opposed to a bunch of separate VR environments, you need a consistent reality that everybody agrees on. Getting everybody to agree on a consistent reality is exactly what blockchains are for.\n\nEthereum lets people agree on arbitrary things, instead of just monetary balances, so it'd be perfect for representing the underlying reality of a metaverse.\n\nYou'll probably have to wait for at least the first version of sharding before it's really practical, though.
I think they mainly differ in how they determine real-world events: Gnosis by chosen judges, Augur by REP holders. I think that gives them separate niches (with some overlap). The general public will be good at determining the truth of some propositions, while others really need specialized expertise.
Right now, due to our account balance system, Ethereum is arguably less private than Bitcoin with its UTXOs. After [Metropolis](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/02/14/ethereum-rnd-roundup-valentines-day-edition/), Ethereum will have the infrastructure for both monero-style ring signatures and the zksnarks in zcash. Then it's just a matter of developing and deploying the smart contracts for strong privacy features.
Ethereum is the blockchain, and ether is the native currency on Ethereum. So "Ethereum price" doesn't really make sense.
Maybe not much computation, but lots of state with lots of updates.
At Vitalik's age the mortality rate is about one in a thousand, so at worst that should only reduce your estimation of a fair price by a tenth of a percent.
Interesting, I hadn't really thought about applying it to pain in general. That's exactly how I deal with cold, and it does make it enjoyable.
If bitcoins aren't used in commerce, then this "store of value" amounts to little more than writing numbers on a piece of paper and sticking it in a vault. There has to be some actual GDP.
Interesting thought...maybe it's a measure of maneuverability or something. But it doesn't invalidate OP's point. However it works, it's clear that it's some kind of performance measure and lower numbers are better.\n\n(But personally I always just figured it wasn't "parsecs" but "par secs," the galactic standard second, as opposed to the various provincial "seconds" that vary depending on length of day and year :)
It doesn't just consider itself a "nonprofit," it literally is a nonprofit under Swiss law.\n\nETH may be many things but one thing it's not is a share in the Ethereum Foundation, which could run out of money and close its doors while ETH rolls merrily on.
Absolutely. Some people have heard the Javascript comparison and jumped to the conclusion that Solidity shares various weaknesses of Javascript; that happened a lot during the DAO mess. So it's worth pointing out the differences when it comes up, but you're right, it doesn't invalidate your point at all.
I really need to study more crypto...would [EIP198](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/198) help at all?\n\nIf not, how generally useful are the primitives it needs? There could always be more precompiles down the road...
There's no way the eth price will stay anywhere near the current level if all people do with it is pay transaction fees. Luckily for eth holders, it's also the dominant currency on Ethereum and we do all sorts of things with it besides pay transaction fees. The more we encourage eth usage in commerce, the better off holders will be.\n\nPlus in a year or so, we'll have proof of stake, and to mine blocks you'll need to pile up eth instead of gpu cards.
And what a champion of democracy the President is.
I really like them too, it's nice getting a quick update in one place with relevant links.\n\nThat's a good idea about the one-off write up...it could give a quick intro to the various major new features so people have some context, and the weeklies could just link to that.
Just like in 2002 I didn't invest in Amazon because they had absurdly high PE ratios. I didn't realize the reason earnings were so low was just that they were reinvesting so much of their revenue. Their stock price has gone up about 50X since then.
These ideas also reduce the chance of getting in trouble with the SEC, [according](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QxOV2dgxO3C_TyVE0-41ZwLlzPmB-EE1NNshJGuedCU/edit#gid=0) to Coinbase.
That's sorta true in proof of work, too...the miners have no incentive to mine since tETH has no value.
Enough to avoid losing a large percentage of pollinators, that's good enough. In general, trying to avoid being completely stupid about the things that keep us alive on this planet would be a nice start.
That doesn't contradict anything I said.
I use it, and most articles linked from reddit are fine, just less annoying. If I want something that's broken, I just whitelist it until I'm done.
Google is ending support for Chrome apps like the Ledger wallet app. But it doesn't matter, you can also use the Ledger with MyEtherWallet and Geth. Plus can import the 24-word phrase into MyEtherWallet if you lose the hardware.
You think that was doomsday-ish, look at what a lot of climate scientists are saying these days.
I'm sure all the trouble with the Euro has nothing to do with this.
It wouldn't take much effort to brute force two words. But the general principle is good, you can trade off whatever balance of protection vs. memorization you like.
I think one solution is just to outcompete them with open source dapps. Commercial software still exists but these days you can do pretty much whatever you need with free software. Dapps can extend that model to entire businesses, not just code. E.g. we don't need a for-profit uber that charges lower fees, we can have a free uber that charges zero fees.\n\nAlso, as long as the SEC prevents us from selling actual shares on the blockchain, we don't have to worry about "maximizing shareholder value" being a topic of discussion with ico-funded enterprises. But to whatever extent we do use corporations, maybe we should make them [benefit corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation).
Is there documentation yet for developers who want to write Status-enabled dapps?
Because the whole point is to convert us over to electric cars and solar and help us avoid catastrophic global warming.
Also there's [state-tree pruning](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/06/26/state-tree-pruning/).
I don't know, but I can say that you don't need the breathing exercises to improve your cold tolerance. I haven't done the breathing at all, but I've sat outside for an hour in 20F weather in just my shorts, held my hands in ice water for ten minutes, and swam in 56F ocean water for 20 minutes, all comfortably. And I'm a skinny guy. The key is to stay relaxed and stop yourself from shivering.\n\nThe ice water dunk hurts like crazy for the first couple minutes but if you power through that the pain goes away, and with practice the first couple minutes don't hurt much either.\n\nIn *Becoming the Iceman* they do the breathing, but generally not right before the cold exposure, and they spend most of their practice time just jumping into extreme cold and dealing with it.
The token itself tends to be just an ERC20, but the ICO that awards tokens usually has some kind of custom business rules, and the way the token interacts with the dapp is custom too...and sometimes requires modifications to the token, e.g. freezing transfers periodically while distributing profits.\n\nI don't know why everybody keeps comparing a class-based, non-garbage-collected, statically-typed language where all numbers are integers to Javascript, which is the opposite of all those things. The only things they have in common are (1) they're both fairly simple languages, and (2) they both have typical curly-brace syntax, just like all the languages you mention and many others. But it is true that this familiar syntax is a much lower barrier to entry than, say, dealing directly with Bitcoin opcodes.
Considering that the Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit while a lot of the Bitcoin Core developers are employed by a for-profit corporation with [$76 million](http://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-55-million-series-a/) in venture capital funding, maybe it's a diversionary tactic.
I was wondering about that. I read it years ago when it was significantly shorter, and it was a fairly tight story that didn't seem unfinished at all.
Fwiw, here are several ways ETH gets used as money so far....\n\n- Funding entrepreneurs\n\n- Gambling\n\n- Paying Solidity developers/auditors, at least some of whom like getting paid in ETH\n\n- And paying miners, of course\n\nI don't necessarily quibble with calling it "weak," since so far the ETH economy is pretty well contained among early adopters/enthusiasts.
Do we really have to wear condoms during the conference? It'd be a hassle when we have to pee.
Then read above. I quoted him. It's fairly clear that the only thing he feels is stopping him is bodies to go after them. Gee, I wonder who controls those resource purse strings. Your optimism is nice, but misplaced, at least in my opinion.
If Kaine wasn't voting FOR all of Trumps nominees, then I would give a shit what he said.\n\nFor a dem nominee for VP, he sure does like Trumps picks quite a bit. 
"We will see" how he does. \n\nI've replied several times in different posts about this. If I didn't put it in the one your are replying to, let me assure you: I am waiting to see how this one rolls out.\n\nI'm not saying it is right, or will be done the way it should. I'm just saying i'm cautiously optimistic this one will be okay. I'm also sure he will fuck it up badly, so "We will see".\n\nTrump, as much as I dislike him, is doing something "smart". He's tossing a fuckton of things out there all at once. He's basically sending this order after these people, and this one after those people......he's throwing a shit ton at the wall to basically divide the country on all these different issues.\n\nin other words, he's kind of tossing things to everyone, giving everyone a little something something that they want. \n\nIn this case, tech workers have been beat to shit by H1B's for years, and they all want it to stop or go away entirely because it's bullshit. There are plenty of highly skilled tech workers out there to fill these jobs. The problem is the companies can get H1B's much cheaper, 1/4 to a 1/3rd the cost of a US resource. \n\nSo, as a tech worker, THIS ONE makes my happy because I have seen the abuse destroy families by replacing US workers with lower skilled H1B's. So......."We will see" is my answer is right now.\n\nI hope he does it right, because I have seen it first hand, but I also bet he will manage to fuck it up a bit as well.\n\n"We will see"\n\n\nEDIT: a word
More realistically, the GOP very much likes Trump as cover for their own shenanigans right now. (Think of Ethics gutting last week)\n\nThey'll let him take the heat as long as possible while they work in the background, then, when it's way too much to take anymore.....boom, Trump is gone via the GOP themselves, and Pence takes over.\n\nWhen Pence takes over, they have about 3 weeks to maybe a month of still intense media scrutiny. Then it dies off, and they start really enacting their agenda, all without the close media scrutiny that is CURRENTLY there because of Trump.\n\nTrump is basically, at this point, a fall guy. The GOP, who didn't exactly want him in the first place so much as the Tea Party did. So it only makes sense that they are doing all they can to inflict as much pain on him while he is still useful. After that, they put fence post Pence in place, and just go balls deep wrecking everything they can. Then, they blame Dems and Trump for all the problems. \n\nWhy people think the GOP is going to keep Trump around any longer than they have to is beyond me. They have Patsy Pence ready, and my guess/bet is withing 60 days max, Trump is out.\n\nAnd don't forget, even when he is gone he will STILL provide plenty of cover with his endless prattle blaming everyone and suing everyone. He will sue the fuck out of them and make noise, giving more cover while they do more shitty things. \n\n
No, we want to give HRC a congress that can override her veto and FORCE change.\n\nIf you think for one minute that HRC will suddenly roll over and be truly progressive without being forced to be so, you are sadly mistaken.\n\nThe ONLY way to have HRC do what would have been done by Sanders is to make 100% sure that there is a congress in place that will not only hold her feet to the fire, but also one that will be able to undo any shenanigans she will get up to with executive orders.\n\nIn this scenario, I agree with republicans: We MUST have a system of checks and balances in place to stop Clinton from fucking everyone over. Which she will absolutely do for her cronies if we don't have the ability to ram that bullshit right back at her.\n\nEDIT: Spelling of two words.
That's when the best voters watch. I know people, great people by the way, and they tell me, ME, that 3 AM is when the best stuff for the best people, on the greatest stations air. THE BEST. Simply no way around it folks. You can have your 6 PM slot, because we got the prime time, the original power hour at 3 AM. I know. The best people told me.

I can partially explain, having been in the telecom industry. Basically, you sign a contract with a telecom, or another provider if one is available. Tell them you want the fattest pipe you can get, merge a few "dsl"(Or other connection type) lines together so to speak if they have to. In return, you sign a contract with them that they maintain it for that many years for xx amount of money. \n\nThink of it like signing up for DirecTV or Dish. You choose the package you want, in return, they provide the service you ask for, usually on a 2 year contract.\n\nIn this case, you are saying to the telecom (or whoever) that you will pay xxx amount per month and they agree to provide that service for 5 years. \n\nIf you REALLY want to get some discounts, offer to pay in full upfront. They may limit you to one year at a time, depending on their policies, but even paying a year upfront will get a discount. \n\nThat being said, IT WILL COST YOU. For a 10 Gig connection, your probably looking at an easy grand a month, more or less. On top of that, the other downside is that you will be contracted at that price. Even if during that 5 years the cost of a 10 gig pipe drops to $5 a month, you are still contracted at the original price. \n\nSince you just won the lottery, you may not give a shit, but if you do give a remote shit, then make sure there is a caveat in the contract about pricing reductions in case of lowered costs. You won't likely get that, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Worst case scenario, you get a lawyer, and renegotiate the 5 year cost as needed.\n\nBut hey, you just won the lottery, so if you are like a lot of people, you won't really give a shit, especially sitting on a 10 gig connection both ways. You'll just be the fastest redditor in town.
My guess is not long. The race is over. The neolibs lost. BIG. If they fight the progressives at this point, the party is toast within six months because the core of the dem party will go green permanently. 
Require it by law.\n\nIf you think anything else will do it, you're wrong.
So, what is your plan to capture the potential votes for people who don't use or have access to the internet?\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad idea, it's just not going to be universal, and your data will ALWAYS skew towards those that are A) On the internet, and B) The subset that will willingly give you information. \n\nYou will need some identifying information, even if only an assigned ID per voter. Which means you then have a massive skew towards basically younger people. Heck, i'm 46, and I wouldn't touch this thing unless I knew it was anonymous completely. Which presents an even bigger problem.\n\nAgain, good idea, but trying to design something for only a portion of the population that would use means your results will be wrong when it comes to the voting populace as a whole. At a guess, you would be much better served by getting ranked choice voting in place nationally. The sheer mathematics of trying to adjust for different demographics will be insane, and you would still likely get you what you already have out there: Online polls like on CNN/FOX/ETC/ETC.\n\nHow would you solve for that, and would it be accurate in any way compared to actual voters nationwide?\n\n\nEDIT: Some words for grammar.
Oh I get it. The flip side is that because of Trump, the GOP is effectively DOA anyway. Some would argue that anyone on the ticket with Trump is likely to get run out anyway.\n\nIt's really a double edged sword, and the albatross of Trump is going to stink up the party for a long time. Overall, the party effectively split in 2012, with Tea Party Republican, and Moderate Republicans on the other side. \n\n2016 is just the funeral and grieving. Like it or not, Trump did what he likely set out to do, which  is fuck things up.
For those that may ask: the reason it may be a grand a month is that nearly all systems are designed as a sort of "one drop per house" environment. For instance, cable companies will design a system to supply the "average" connection to a percentage of customers along the route. In the past, i've seen anywhere from 50 to 90 percent design penetration (HAH, Design penetration).\n\nSo if you are asking for something like a 10 GIG pipe, the cables and telco wires on the pole aren't likely to have that capacity at the "tap" so to speak. Telecom is a bit different, more to do with the router and central office tech, and that you can have 2 lines to your house in most cases because of twisted pair (Trying to keep this simple), but it still going to require a bit to get you that special connection. And special costs money.
EXACTLY. Every time this question is asked, I reply the same way as you.\n\nIf the media digs in, they will take BOTH Trump and Bill down. Suddenly, what seems like a no-brainer, destroy Trump hit piece takes out Bill, and Hillary by default. \n\nIt's so incredibly obvious "why" it isn't talked about by the media, and yet, people simply don't get it. The ones railing that this is outrageous are completely clueless that Epstein flew Bill multiple times to sex island via Lolita Express. \n\nThey go on and on and on about it, until you clue them in that Bill rode the bus as well, and then it finally dawns on them why the media isn't touching it.  
Huh. I most certainly did miss that, thought those references where part of the emails from Friday.
For those interested in reading the "Reasoning" of why it was not moved from Sch 1, link below to Federal Register:\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/drug-enforcement-administration\n
While banks should be held accountable for the problems, remember that millions of people are employed by them. \n\nSanctions and punishments MUST be targeted, and regulations must be introduced to protect the employees. If you fine banks a few billion dollars, they will cover that cost in multiple ways, and one of them is downsizing to cover the fines. \n\nBreaking them up is another thing people talk about. That's even more dangerous. Breaking banks up is thrown around a lot, yet what people don't seem to understand is that how that breakup is done means a lot of people are going to be out of work. \n\nIf you believe breaking them up won't hurt anyone, then you have no idea what you are talking about. Yes, banks and executives should be held accountable for problems. Very much so. Just be careful how you push it, because even though it will help consumers, it will most certainly hurt the financial sector employees a lot more. 
Oh, i'm all for it affecting his companies as well, don't get me wrong. \n\nH1B's should be eliminated. They are abused, not matter which company is doing the abuse.
I like the idea....but I also don't sign up for random sites I've never heard of. Mainly, I don't like giving out personal data like emails or whatever to random sites.\n\nAnyone else out there actually used this before?
Perfect example of how to do it just happened, although it was done badly, which has it's own issues. The legislation to allow 9/11 victims that Obama vetoed was just overturned by congress.\n\nIn that case, the congress was more about lip service to 9/11, but it will backfire because the legislation was bad to begin with. However, it also serves as a blueprint, but a cautionary tale. \n\nGiven a congress that would pursue Bernie's agenda, and not Clinton's would work because then there would be a congress that is not only willing to push things like a $15 an hour minimum wage, but also a congress that would override Clinton's likely veto of that kind of legislation. \n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that kind of check on her power could very well mimic what just happened with the 9/11 bill. Congress could get so caught up in just the idea of a bill for something or other that they may override a veto of Clinton's against bad legislation as well. As was just seen, a veto override can have unintended consequences.\n\nThat's why we need Sanders, and possibly Warren, exactly where they are, to help everyone understand what is good to pass/override, and what is bad. It's a tightrope.
Good for you, and your company. Nice to see one doing the right thing.\n\nSadly, you won't find that at 99.999% of other companies. Pure abuse to get cheaper labor.\n
Hey man, I agree wholeheartedly. It was the same for me. I got bored around the end of the first SRL but I was hooked until then for those same reasons. I'll still give destiny 2 a fair shake though. 
And you are if you believe he is actually in it to win it. But, being a Trump supporter, i'm going to hazard a guess that you and I won't see eye to eye on this one.\n\nHowever, I will say this: I've been around campaigns since the 70's. This is by far the most entertaining thing I have EVER seen in politics. By far. \n\nI honestly wish you the best, but please do take a step outside the echo chamber. Heck, i'll go one better. I can't fucking stand Hillary. Haven't liked her since I had the pleasure back in 84-85. Fuck that shit. I'll vote all the other races.
Huh. Well, you and I interpreted that a lot different. Leahy keyed it up and Sessions was really clear: he's against it, and it is against the law. 
ahem.....Episode 2: FBI Boogaloo\n\nIn the future, when you reference ANYTHING Episode 2, it must have an Electric Boogaloo reference attached. Failure to do so will result in ridicule for op.
Probably with cartoon pictures to explain what is going on.\n\n"See this doggy right here? He's pissing on Germany right now. Chancellor rick-rolled Obama"
You can read other replies for the long winded version.\n\nShort Version:\n\nMedical related: Takes time and clinical studies to prove, and a good share fail, or end up being cost prohibitive.\n\nElectronics (Like super batteries we hear about once a week): They either are found to not work as promised after further testing, be cost prohibitive, or worse, another company buys and sits on the patent because it would be too disruptive to their own business/product revenue. \n\n
I'm willing to bet you didn't have 2 kids to feed when you made your sacrifices. I won't stew on the comment, you sound exactly like the lot over there. No worries, i'll be just fine. \n\nBut again, good for you that you live in a nice neighborhood and made sacrifices. Good for you.
Think of how it would look if his statement came out the day after the election. The screams of "FIX WAS IN" would be extraordinarily louder than releasing the statement today.
Yes, HER veto. Let's dispel the myth Hillary is in this for anything other than power and money.\n\nIf some law comes across her desk for signature or veto, and that legislation will hurt her foundation contributors, she will veto it. Thinking she will do what is right is stupid and foolish on specific things like bank regulations and health care. Either of those will cost some of her major donation companies massive profits. OF COURSE she would veto them.\n\nThis is Clinton we are talking about, not someone who is trustworthy. Even people being queried in polls recognize how shifty she is, not matter how many people try to "correct" the facts.
Or hate it ironically.
YES, and ideally if you know nothing about this, the salesperson/expert you hire to deal with this stuff would steer you down that road.\n\nHonestly, what you said, that is pretty much exactly my "lottery dream" connection. I was more trying to keep it in as simple to explain as possible. \n\nPersonally, my ideal is this;I would pay a contractor to lay the fattest pipe from house to the box (Hell, to the CO if I had to), and say to them: "Max that fucker out, i'll take care of the equipment on my end."
Like I said, good for your company. \n\nNot the case in most of the larger ones.
From a tech worker point of view? No, H1B's should be completely trashed and companies need to justify on paper, publicly, why they need a foreign worker, instead of a US resident.\n\nThey need to demonstrate, with skills side by side, pay side by side, experience side by side, why they are 100% unable to find a US worker. \n\nAs in, they must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, why they must go outside the US for employees. \n\nThe problem, since you may not know, is that the H1B replacements tend to ALWAYS be lower skilled. They are most certainly cheaper, but if you have ever worked with those H1B's, you know almost immediately it had nothing to do with skillset and everything to do with salary.\n\nSee, this particular topic, most US tech workers have seen H1s' take US workers out for no other reason than pay. It's kind of like those other executive orders, he's targeting groups of Americans who have been impacted by these things with each different order. He's tossing shit out there left and right to divide us. \n\nAnd on this one, I can understand why. I'm a tech worker. H1B's and the reasons for them are bullshit. \n\nThe problem isn't that they aren't following the law, it's that the law is so fucking full of holes that it doesn't take much to follow the law. So they abuse it.\n\nYeah, i'm not fan of Trumpy baby, but on this one, I can understand his divide and conquer approach. I'm all for eliminating H1b's and have been since I saw them destroy workers a long time ago.\n\nSo, as in all other replies: "We will see". I'm not sure how he would approach this one, but on the surface, so far, i'm okay with upending H1B's. They are a MAJOR reason tech workers struggle to find work. 
You......you want to isolate the self-congratulating BS so that it doesn't even include the applause?\n\nWell, I suppose it would show how incredibly fucked up these people really are, so i'm all for that. However, I still won't watch them.
If you've ever been displaced by a MUCH CHEAPER H1B foreign worker, then you might not be so against this one.\n\nCompanies that are about to complain about this one......well, they abuse it the most. I don't have a lot of sympathy for them. \n\nIn this one particular case.......I actually think he MIGHT be doing the right thing if they force companies to prioritize American workers before hiring H1B. This has been a plague in tech for a LONG time. 
Oof. Well that certainly wasn't intentional. I'll just stick with 100% hatred, no exceptions, and leave it at that.
That's a misrepresentation and you know it. They aren't paying their fair share. 
This question is why I came to trees today. \n\nWhat are the chances he actually does legalize? The answer that is really needed would be: at what date does it become too late for Trump to do anything.\n\nYes, Trump COULD rescind it, but depending on HOW Obama does it presents the twist.\n\nThere are plenty of people/businesses out there that would like a piece of that pie. IF Obama does it soon, and says "Effective Immediately, Pot is off the schedule list and legal.", then that creates a huge problem for Trump. \n\nThe majority of Americans are pro-pot. That means that something that will immediately spur major investments and a fuck-ton of revenue very quickly will be jumped on. People will be pleased but worried. \n\nTrump is also a businessman, so when he sees, and I assume he would understand, his best bet would be to tax it, but NOT rescind it would be the right thing to do. Too much money, revenue, business investment, job creation, etc will be happening so fast that to stop it would be to crash an entire multi billion dollar mini economy OVERNIGHT. \n\nThat's a tough one. My bet is he might just do nothing and let it go on. \n\nPersonally, this is my opinion, but the likely scenario if Obama mic drops this one on America is optimistic. This idea/method/scenario SHOULD be getting a LOT of noise from supporters, across the internet and make SURE Obama gets the idea ASAP. Sadly, it seems no one is looking at it this way, which is an absurd shame considering the chances of it rolling out this way. \n\nIf I wasn't baked, i'd start a petition or something under my name.\n\nEDIT: Atrocious grammar.
And?\nWhat's the point of spending money on pesky things like employees and office space when you don't really have any interest in getting the job?
You've never been displaced by an H1B. If you had, and you got the glory to train your much cheaper, much less skilled, replacement, then you might not be so upset about this one.\n\nI fucking hate Trump. I think he's going to blow shit up in very bad ways. \n\nYet, this particular one? I'm fine with. Companies abuse this ALL THE FUCKING TIME to replace skilled US workers, with lesser skilled H1B's. 
In general, Tribes can do whatever they want with an "item" as long as it is legal at the state level.\n\nFor instance, as I understand it from an example in Iowa, the state legalized scratch off lottery tickets. The tribes in Iowa were then allowed to have gambling, but because of agreements, they could set it up how they like. Like the casino that opened after that in Tama. Scratch off gambling now legal for the state? Great, then the tribes can have gambling without restricting it to scratch off tickets. \n\nSo, that is my understanding overall. Once something is even a little legal, the tribes in that state can do what they want with it, within reason, and as long as it's not specifically outlawed at the federal level. \n\nSame would apply to pot. This ones a bit trickier though, because it's illegal at the federal level. So tribes can certainly open up shops where states have legalized, but they are VERY leary because of the fed laws. \n\nPlus, you know, they haven't exactly had great success as a people when it comes to white men laws.
Hi Frank, wrong account, I'm Gerald. You're calling Betty Gerald. Frankly, its bad, and you should feel bad.\n\nEdit for Hilarity
Partially, but make no mistake, Bush is the one that put the final nail in the coffin by allowing CLEC's to be fucked in the ass hard.
Bull. They said daily. NOT when the last one peters out in the media.\n\nSo far, DWS resigned. That is fallout from Day 1 release. However, no other fallout so far, and an almost silence from WikiLeaks. 
I rate it poorly. Ignoring the fact that you are piling one EO on top of another in a single EO, #5 (I believe) has already been done to a degree. \n\nThe rest effect more than just govt and govt workers/contractors, and are likely to fail on challenges in court. I'm not entirely clear on how that works, but I believe EO's in general are more or less restricted to pure govt. (Someone please clarify, it's too early, not enough coffee)\n\nIt's nice and all, but I doubt it would survive all the lawsuits that would happen about 2 seconds after it was signed. Toss on that you are combining different things within one, and it makes it even worse. Good luck\n
I find it very odd that Obama can talk like this, yet within his own power is a way to make sure offenses like this don't effect minorities. He could reschedule mmj, and take a HUGE fucking chunk out of the DEA and local law enforcement budgets for going after people with a gram of a flower.\n\nYes, I get that isn't the only solution. I just find it remarkable that Obama himself is using this as a soundbite instead of doing what he can to fix the problem with the stroke of a pen on an executive order.
Came here to say the same thing. I've seen entire divisions wiped out, and replaced overnight with H1B's. The companies don't give one shit, it's all about how much workers cost.\n\nThis one.....this one thing, I sincerely hope he executive orders this the right way, and doesn't cave to cheap non US workers. We will see.
Julian said yesterday that he is "waiting for the right time" or along those lines. Many many many people called him on it and said prior to nomination IS the right time to change the future course of the election.\n\nFor a guy that has every reason, and wants to bring down Hillary, he sure has a funny way of seeing the right time. If anytime is right, it's stopping her before the nomination.\n\nIt seems very much more that he WANTS her to be nominated so that he can release prior to the General, and hand it to Trump to teach her a lesson. That is what it reads like to me. He couldn't be more wrong.\n\nIf he wanted to make an impact, he would have already released the most damaging stuff. If he doesn't do it today, then it simply won't matter because the media will not pick it up down the road.
Wow. While Hillary in cuffs would be entertaining, I can't even imagine the boredom of a Kaine presidency. The guy is just.....dull. To be honest, although I think Kaine "won" his debate with Pence on content, he just came across as a little bit.....whiney? Meek-voiced? Boring? I'm not even sure how to describe him, other than those words. \n\n
TO BE FRANK I DO NOT THINK THAT WAS A PENALTY
Or you could just to Universal Health Care paid for like many other nations pay for it, and avoid the complicated mess altogether. \n\nIf you think businesses (not insurance companies, especially health insurance) wouldn't like to nix health care you're wrong. It's not just the cost employees pay for health insurance, and businesses know this. They have to have employees to manage it, and even if a lot of costs are passed to employees, there is still a large portion of overhead to go into it for the business itself. \n\nIf the US switched to Universal, a lot of businesses would be more than happy to stop having to deal with the overhead of providing health care. It's expensive, and removing those costs would improve bottom lines. \n\nYES, Universal will cost jobs. Health Insurance industry jobs. They are effectively middle men between client and doctor. It's an additional expense, including Health Insurance industry profits, that is just driving healthcare costs higher. A perfect example is those states who have moved medicare/medicaid handling to private industry instead of state managed. Costs in those states to provide the programs are failing across the board. Why? Because those managing companies are after profits, and deny claims to make those profits. \n\nLook at Iowa where it recently went private. Costs have gone up, care has become complicated because the companies managing the system (now private) are denying claims, delaying care, and providers are getting pinched because they can't get paid for even covered care.\n\nIt's inhuman, and only hurts people that need the care, and the end businesses that provide the care. The private companies are literally slow walking payments they do make and healthcare providers are complaining that they are having to take out loans to pay employees because the insurance companies simply aren't paying as agreed. Costs are going up, and in Iowa, the savings promised are being wiped out completely, the private health insurance companies are already gearing up to ask for more money from the state, effectively nixing the cost-savings the governor promised. That same governor gets lots of donations from those same companies. Do the math.\n\nHealth insurance, at a minimum, should be about health care, and not profits. As soon as profits enter into it, then cost cutting in the form of less care follows. \n\nsummary: Stop trying to overcomplicate how to solve healthcare at a business level. Remove it from the equation and suddenly employing full time people becomes a lot less of a barrier. Not just in costs, but in costly paperwork and scheduling limitations. If you talk to larger businesses (not the smaller exempt ones, but even some of them), then you will find those businesses would love to stop having to deal with the entire mess.
You're not in tech, nor have you been involved in the process. That's pretty clear. 
No, Trump likes to delegate to his managers. One of his new managers hates pot, and guess what? That shiney new manager isn't going to be nice about it.\n\nIf you think differently, then you are a Trump voter, just now starting to realize the bait and switch you voted for.
So....you want leaders of states that have exactly zero vested interest in changing voting laws (in essence, GOP makes stupid laws, and Dems campaign race after race against them), to suddenly roll over and do a Const Convention to make things better? \n\nYou want abortion outlawed? Because that's how you get abortion outlawed. These states will never get together and enact positive change with the politicians we currently have. You want change, permanent, const convention change? Vote progressives into office. Get out, make phone calls, make a difference. 
Stupid paywalll.....however, i'm pretty sure they are just talking enforcement dollars.\n\nMMJ is still illegal, but a new law makes the DEA not go after mmj where it is legal. HOWEVER, and you may have guessed already, that hasn't stopped them. 
Maybe it's just me, but that note actually goes out of it's way to NOT implicate DWS.\n\nDon't get me wrong, she is scum.
And so the inevitable impeachment of Trump quietly begins.\n\nRemember, they will push him out and put Pence in place. When they do that, which is likely soon, Trump will make A FUCK TON OF NOISE. He will be all over the media. He will sue everyone he can.\n\nAnd while he is providing that cover, which the GOP wants, the congress and Pence will proceed to do to the Nation what Brownback has done in Kansas.\n\nI'd like to see Trump gone. I'm also fully aware that Pence is not going to be any better for the nation.
Upvote for closest resemblance so far. How far? Folks, so very far that people tell me it's farther away than other things.
Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa has been there since 1981. That's working out well.
She is also, or at least hints at it, anti-vax. Something Sanders does not believe in. Toss on homeopathy, and a few other things, and you can see that the Green platform, unless SIGNIFICANTLY changed, simply isn't as good a fit as people like to think.\n\nSanders still has come clout, and some plays potentially, but at this point, we need to get Berniecrats that ARE on the ticket into office.\n\nPersonally, I won't do trump, I won't do Johnson or Stein, and I don't believe I can do Clinton. It will all depend on the polls right before the election. \n\nIf it isn't even close, then I will sit out the presidential race, and just vote all the down ticket races. If it is close, I will literally flip a coin in the booth. Heads, I still sit it out, and still vote down ballot. Tails, Hillary gets a vote. That is the best I can offer for those that scream about unity. #FlipACoinInTheBooth\n
Tax credits are complete bullshit if you don't have the money to buy it in the first place.\n\nGOP is great for Tax Credits for folks who have free cash flow.
Yes, and here's how: CBD, if this holds, will now have its own category, specifically CBD extracted, instead of flower.\n\nWhat this means is they are specifically setting it up so that CBD extract itself can be moved to a different level in the schedule, and allow pharma to just do that specific piece, without having to reschedule the rest.\n\nIn other words, this is step one of handing over parts of pot to pharma, by seperating non-psychoactive, but beneficial pain relief from the flower into other categories. This is step one. In about 6 months to a year, when pharma finalizes current cbd drug trials, DEA will then reschedule CBD lower. \n\nIf you think this won't happen, then you weren't watching the election. THC, the naughty part, is being left in the crosshairs as soon as Trump takes office.
Personally how do I feel? I think no company should be allowed to bring in even one H1B without PUBLICLY proving they can't find a comparable US worker. \n\nEvery single time, they should have to publicly submit for an H1B, and it should be a SLOW PAINFUL EXPENSIVE PROCESS.\n\nYou really want to see how H1B's work? Make one simple rule change: H1B's must pay 125% of the average US citizen salary. In other words, if you are replacing a US worker making $100K a year, you must pay, DIRECTLY, to the H1B, $125K a year. \n\nYou make that one change, H1B's will not be used anymore. That's how strongly tech workers feel about H1B's. They are abused, and they are bullshit.
I've seen it destroy workers lives first hand. I've also been a victim of it.\n\nFuck them. They like this program because they can abuse it. They will kill whole groups and replace them with H1B's, just because they are cheaper.\n\nRemember the workers at Disney? Yeah, all perfectly great, well trained US Tech workers. Fired, and forced to retrain, their H1B replacements. \n\nI'm not an ally of Trump, but in this particular case.......i'm 100% behind this one if it's done right. If it just leaves a bunch of loopholes, then fuck it. We will see.\n\nEDIT: a word
Between this and his other comment regarding lack of resources.....well, who now holds the purse strings for those resources?\n\nDo they \nA) Allow the Cole Memo to stand, even though they have MULTIPLE reasons not to, not the least of which is donations from Pharma, or\nB) Just increase his budget and watch while those very liberal leaning states get blasted in raids.\n\nNow, a lot of people would say "Logicaly, it makes more sense to let the states continue because states rights....."\n\nI say, "Bullshit, this is the party of Pharma. This is the party of Prison Industry. This is the party of Tough on Crime." Good luck to all people who want to see the nation allow Marijuana. \n\nIf this doesn't make you concerned, you haven't been paying attention. This isn't about states rights, it's about Morality control. The "Family Values" party does not think this is valuable.
The bird onstage and his podium. That video says it all.
No, he is making sure he gets paid back the money he put in himself. Once the GOP makes him whole, he will start spending THEIR money.\n\nHe's a businessman.\n\nOf course, the pesky obvious fact to anyone with a brain is that he has exactly zero interest in any of this, except for the ego cock stroking at the rallies. Aside from that, it's pretty clear he has no interest in actually winning. \n\nThere is no point in spending his own money on field offices for a job he has no intention of taking. If he hasn't dropped for one reason or another by mid Oct at the latest, I would be shocked. 
You are mistaken. There is NO shortage of VERY skilled tech workers.\n\nThere is, however, a lot of companies willing to pay a 1/3rd of an american salary to an H1B with lesser skills. They bring them in, train them up, and still end up cheaper, even if it takes a year to bring an H1B up to speed. \n\nIt's NOT ABOUT TALENT, it's about cost.\n\nFrom the outside, you just repeated the TALKING POINT these companies use to push for more H1B's. That talking point is bullshit.
I get your point. My guess is actually the same as yours....they will run someone. \n\nHowever, I don't think they will put a whole lot of effort or money into it. They will go through the motions, they will rally the crowds. In the end though, if Trump jumps, they won't go out of their way to try and win, because in the end, the money is better used elsewhere. Or really, their donors money will be used on better things than an obvious losing ticket.
I don't even know what team/product they are cheerleaders/spokesmodels for. Whoever that Team/Product owner is should hire this guy instead. 
bwahahahahahahah. as one tech worker replaced by an H1B to another who I am guessing has seen it as well.......yes, I hope he does the needful. \n\n
What? This is what was said:\nLeahy : “Regarding states rights. states have also voted on the issue of marijuana. Your own state of Alabama permits a derivative of marijuana known as CBD oil. Which is legal in Alabama, but illegal under federal law. If you are confirmed as the nation’s chief law enforcement official, you know we have very limited federal resources. Would you use our federal resources to investigate and prosecute sick people who are using marijuana in accordance with their state laws?”\n\nSessions answered: “I won’t commit to never enforcing federal law. But absolutely, it’s a problem of resources for the federal government. The Department of Justice under Lynch and Holder set forth some policies they thought were appropriate regarding states that have legalized in some fashion.” He added that there has been criticism of those policies, “some of them are truly valuable, but fundamentally the criticism that I find legitimate is that they [the Cole memo guidelines] may not have been followed. Using judgment in how to handle these cases will be mine, and I will do it in a fair and just way.”\n\nYes, you COULD optimistically read positive into it. However, bear in mind, this is GOP here. What he stated is that he might not be able to NOW, but if resources were made available, he will go after those states. But I like your optimism.
Considering the link doesn't work, i'd suggest you might want to revisit your promise of a link that works.
Well, the question is now answered. During a conversation with Leahy, he states Congress enacted laws, and he will enforce them. Specifically, MMJ and recreational are against federal law. \n\nGame over.
No. You stop that.
All the cool Goth kids will love it.

Sounds like a video id want to see!
I live in a very rural area. \n\nThe problem isn't contact with the party in general, it's that state level Dem Parties tend not to support candidates in rural districts BECAUSE they tend to lose to Repubs. (Vicious circular cycle)\n\nTake the Steve King/Weaver matchup. I'm on the ground. State level support for Weaver was practically non-existent. There are multiple reasons, but consider these: Spending ad dollars against King a very red district would be a bad bet, so they didn't help much. The other, MUCH LARGER REASON: King and other pols like him make VERY good poster children for the bad apples in the GOP. \n\nKing, the asshole, is probably one the largest bad apples, next to Cruz. \n\nIn this election, all assumed HRC and a lot of other dems would win. But still in districts like Kings' the party didn't help much. Why? Because the DNC was sure they would win, then leverage assholes like King still in office to get him out the next time. Meanwhile, he makes a perfectly good asshole to sit there and say outlandish things. They lambast him in the press, but let him stay in just to show how much better they are.\n\nWell, 2016 proved a lot of people wrong, most importantly, it should have finally proved once and for all to the DNC that their action plans suck. \n\nSo, out here, in bumfuck Iowa, the state and national party need to fully support rural candidates. That is what needs to happen. Don't you worry about the votes, we are all out here and aware, we just haven't had the best candidates. \n\nLet me say that again: We are all out here and aware. We are aware that the national party regards us as a nuisance area, but good for asshole quotes from guys like King.\n\nWhat do we need: NATIONAL PARTY SUPPORT FOR RURAL CANDIDATES. That's it. We don't need phone calls, we need advertising to let people know that the party will spend just as much on the non GOP as the GOP will happily spend on their rural candidates. We need to know that the state and national actually give a shit. \n\nYou know who does rural candidate support right? The GOP. You know who won these areas? The GOP. You know who completely failed to do either (Again)? A party that is not united and doesn't look likely to survive. Yes, from out here, it very much looks like the DNC is crumbling. Good luck.
Sigh, so many ways to pick it apart, but I will just go with this one.\n\nWhile $26 may sound like nothing to you, to a family of four stuck in an area where there are no jobs, and living off of $300 a month for food for that family of four......well, that $26 might be a few days of meals. Not good ones, but at least it's something to eat.\n\nIt's called a poll tax, and it isn't allowed. It's a barrier to the poor voting, which is explicitly by design.\n\nGood for you that $26 is nothing. To others, it's a metric ton, and deciding between feeding your kids and paying $26 for a piece of paper, most will choose to feed their kids. Thus, giving up their right to vote.\n\nIf none of that makes sense to you, there is a Trump forum that will welcome you with open arms. Just make sure to wear your white robe and hat.
"Missed it by THAT much"\n\nI'm honestly not sure why people keep tuning in. He's already released information that is really fucking horrible, and no dems blinked, they just ignored it and moved on.\n\nWhat could he have at this point that would even get people interested or sink the campaign? BEING REALISTIC: People already know HRC is corrupt to the core, and won't keep many of her promises unless forced to. Dem voters are going to vote for her, even republicans will, just to protect from Trump. \n\nHere's a fun game: Imagine a scenario in which something she did would sink her campaign. Now say it out loud by answering. I personally doubt that anyone could come up with something that would actually do it. At least, not this election. Many have tried, many of hated her and her policies and politics, and none of it is working to bring her even close to down.\n\nClinton's have always been teflon. Now people don't even give a shit, because you can't sink lower than Clintons.
Oh how I hate this president. Yet, i'm in tech. I've got exactly ZERO problem with this one. \n\nCompanies have been abusing this system for a LONG time, and it should have been stopped. If you've been in tech, you've seen workers that are great replaced with H1B's that aren't great, but are most certainly cheaper.\n\nif you've trained replacements that are clearly not as skilled as those they replaced, then you won't be against this one.\n\nRemember those US workers at Disney that were pushed out for H1B's? Yeah, that's what this is about. In this ONE particular case, go Trump. I hope he fucking kills the program. This is probably the only thing I would agree with him on, and I agree because i've seen the damage first hand. \n\n
Look, I get that is the standard pat answer right now. Heck, I even have hope that he will just do that.\n\nHowever, much like everything else he says......why on earth do you think this thing out of so many things would be the one thing he keeps his word on? I'm happy to go with the "chance" he will go on, but again....\n\nWhy this? Why this one thing in particular are folks willing to bet he will keep his word? To me? Wishful thinking.\n\nI'm reading tons of threads about will he, won't he, all on different topics. Heck, you can even call out Medicare and Medicaid, which he said he wouldn't touch, but now seems to be on the table for new laws. \n\nSo.....out of all the things he has said, all the ways legislation is gearing up on capital hill....why on earth are you betting he would keep his word on this particular issue. I'm genuinely curious whenever this particular topic comes up that people think he would keep his word. Why do you feel that way?\n\nEDIT: A word or two spelled incorrectly.
They would also be a lot better if it wasn't 99.99% self congratulations they heap upon themselves for being so smart/fiscally responsible/awesome.\n\nTed Talks are nothing more than rich people congratulating themselves the majority of the time. If they got rid of that 99% self congratulations, they would be worth spending time on every one. Instead, most are completely insufferable.
Well, there goes the MMJ industry. Too bad, it was starting to employ a metric ton of people and bring in revenue.
"We will see".\n\nOn this one, just this one, I am cautiously optimistic, but will wait to see what actually gets signed.
Feel free to don the golden bird
FUCK YES WE DO
This picture has been around for a while.
I need to see some points but the defense seems locked in and ready to go. Bodes well. I like getting the ball at the half too.
fair point. 
;)
I heard that too. terrifying. I wonder when the christian re education camps will open.
I'm of the same opinion on the speeches, they don't particularly scream that she wants to break them up, and read in certain ways, back up the whole "told them to cut it out" narrative. I don't think they are that damaging, \n\nI just happen to think they could have been seized on by the GOP, but Trump getting stuff released overshadowed them to the point that the Dems have plenty of time to spin them the way they want to be thought of.\n\nAlso, and again, my opinion, I don't see Clinton as pushing single-payer. She may give voice to it now, but by no means was she pushing it at the beginning of the primaries. I've not bothered to look (mainly because I think it is likely lip service with no follow through), but I'm guessing she is saying single payer now on her policy positions. However, I highly highly doubt she will push single payer if elected. Too much money for insurance companies is at stake, and they simply won't allow HER to do anything. Being forced by a liberal congress though? Yeah, that would be out of her control, especially if there is enough of them to override her likely veto of single payer. Just lip service for votes at this point. I wouldn't actually trust her to run for Treasurer of a town of 500 people, but that's just me.
Bwahahah, Trump voters. Sessions is VERY anti-mmj. Unless Obama or Trump deschedules or reschedules IMMEDIATELY, the "experiment" in the laboratories of democracy is over. Stock up, it's going to be a long, DRY, 4 years (at least).
Ah, my apologies on the confusion then.\n\nSo, I have also worked on the H1B for companies, and my experience is much different. It's highly abused, from what I have seen. That is both from a perspective a "line" person doing the training for offshore you spoke of, and, also, at a high level where the decisions were made about who to bring over to replace US workers.\n\nMy experience was ALWAYS that it was cost driven. Always. Like I said, very good for your company, they should be applauded. The ones I saw were clearly money driven. They most certainly could have brought in U.S. workers, with more experience for the jobs, or rather, just kept the ones already there. \n\nNope, what I saw was money saving, not job saving. Again, my apologies on the confusion. 
Married 15 now, and it's taken a long time to get it right.\n\nIt's not, at least for my wife, the gift. It's the presentation. I could get a diamond necklace, put it in front of her, with a single card, single rose, and have a nice dinner at home. THAT WOULD NOT GO WELL FOR ME.\n\nAlternatively, I could get her a pair of socks, accompany that with a dinner out, play darts at a bar, go to a park and twirl on the merry-go-round for 15 minutes. All while laughing and listening to her talk about different things. \n\nIt's not the socks, it's not the diamond, it's the PAYING ATTENTION TO HER that is what she wants. Not sidetracked with this or that, half paying attention to even hear what she orders for dinner. \n\nEven when we couldn't afford much, at least getting out of the house, even for a long walk, and paying 100% attention to everything she says, and 100% interaction on that conversation level will do it. Even if I only got a pair of socks. \n\nWe just had our valentines weekend. Sure, I spent a couple hundred on food and drinks and things. You know what my gift was? A dirty love letter. You know why she got that? Because i listened to her a few months back and started writing one. You know who had a fabulous Valentines day because of me paying attention to one off-hand comment 2 months ago? We BOTH DID. Because she saw I was paying attention.\n\nMe? Paying attention pays off. Put your phone away, don't turn on the tv. Turn to your SO, pay attention to them, and turn them on instead.\n\n\n\nEDIT: REDDIT Gold? Wow, thanks everyone for the replies. Wishing you all the best, and a whole lot of fun paying attention to your SO's!
Seems to me, he just made a nice GOP case to get more resources to renew the drug war. But hey, I like your optimism.
It is not impossible. Time consuming? Yes. Problematic in getting all the permits (right of way, railroad crossings, pole agreements)? Yes. \n\nEnough companies and contractors available to do the work? Problematic as a lot of the telecom contractors have not had luck finding work in the last decade, so many of them went to other lines of work......but still possible to gear up a new generation of people to do the mapping/design and labor.\n\nIt's possible, not impossible, but it would be strategically difficult to get all of infrastructure in place. If it was 2024, that would be an easy target. 2020 is doable, but it won't be easy or cheap.\n\nAnd that, then, is the heart of the problem. Telco and Cable companies will NOT want to spend the money, unless they are required to do so. \n\nAnd there is the rub. If you require them to do it, then taxpayers would foot the bill because the giants will not do it willingly. HOWEVER, if you open up the playing field to competition and seed funding, you would see a massive movement from a lot of places to get to work.\n\nThe giants don't want competition. It would mean less profits and shelling out a FUCK TON of money. The only way to make them do it is forced competition. \n\nIf it weren't for the obvious lawsuits from the giants, it is more than possible to get most if not all people connected. \n\ntl;dr: Possible, but you will never get the giants to agree to it unless they have competition from other companies in all areas that need the build out.
YES, and I personally am a bit awed at the ones who say they shouldn't. If your opponent is playing full contact, and you are playing flag football, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nListen, it's been 30 fucking years the GOP has been using this playbook and WINNING. Right now, they won the whole chimichanga.\n\nAnd the dems? Well, they just keep dusting off the same playbook and trotting it out every 2-4 years, just to be told (AGAIN) that those rules don't apply anymore.\n\nThe GOP is going to TOAST the US of A in the next few years, but meanwhile Dems are sitting there saying "Let's be all things to all people" and "We can be nice and win".\n\nYeah, that's worked so well these last 3 decades. Good luck to those that think we can win without getting our hands in the shit. 
Selective outrage. One of the "Clinton Standards" of a campaign.
Yea, no, email is free. This sounds more like a money grab. I'm all in for what they are doing, but saying they need funds to get this to dems on the floor TODAY? Who and what exactly do they need to pay for?
Basketball. I was poor as dirt growing up and that's what I often found myself doing.
*A T **L* I**
What, you think they haven't?\n\nSo, yes, there is so much major shit that is publicly known, but countered by Clinton propaganda machine. Most of us, and certainly all of Bernie supporters, along with the polled public.....what is it, something like only 26% believe she is honest? Yeah, so most of us wouldn't be remotely shocked at anything new. Just more irritated in what we as a united public have become: willing to vote in the best lizard.\n\nBasically, 74% of us believe she is a liar. Yet, she is allowed to get away with it, and the obvious theft of the primaries, (Go ahead CTR, do what you have to in the thread.) so what would it actually take for the public to NOT vote for her?\n\nIf 74% believe the crap already out there, then it isn't a huge leap to a point where she could have personally killed someone with a spoon, and we would give her a pass. Hell, she could just broadcast it on a Pay Per View, and not only would we pay to watch, we would still, overall at this point, vote her into office. \n\nThe GOP, on the flip side, has got it's own major problems. No, it IS NOT Trump. It's what created Trump. The GOP courted the Tea Party into their ranks, and now it is going to eat them alive. And there isn't fuck all the GOP moderates can do. They have no time to either dump Trump, o run an indy moderate.\n\nWhat does that leave them? Either plug their collective noses and vote Trump, stick their fingers in their ears and go Johnson, are protect what is left of the moderate arm of the party and vote Clinton. We've already seen plenty that are voting Clinton. The moderates would vote Clinton because it gives at least HOPE that they can semi-unite the party again in another Presidential Enemy of the Idiots. It won't work, the Tea Party Nut Bags are OVER-IT with the namby-pamby moderate GOP members, and will revolt completely after the election. The GOP is effectively dead. The DNC, has similar problems with the moderate centrists, versus the Bernie progressives.\n\nFor now, most people are resigned to just deal with Clinton for now, and go for the kill (Last Gasp for the GOP is likely), in the 2018 midterms. If nothing changes with how campaigns can be run, 2018 is going to suck for us, the general public, in terms of outrageous candidates.\n\nIt's a shame that the voters have given up this much. 
Bwahaha, NICE. I accept your fixing, because as much as I don't think it will roll out that way, I would love to see it.
There is another option, which, surprisingly to me, isn't being talked about: GOP does not run a Presidential candidate.\n\nTrump is a loser, at least in electability. Not to mention whether or not he ever intended to even get this far. That is very much up for debate, but seriously doesn't even matter.\n\nLet's say he drops. The GOP would then be backed into a corner, and would, in theory, put up another candidate. But they aren't REQUIRED to do so. In fact, it may be in their best interests to not put one up at all. \n\nRealistically, the only candidate they could get that would challenge HRC, IRONICALLY, would be Sanders. Yes, I typed that correctly. There is no one in the GOP that could start right now that would stand even a remote chance of winning against Hillary. For the GOP, there is simply no time to bring in someone new. The Dems would start on day one crushing that new person.\n\nSo, why would the GOP even want to spend the effort or money on something that is bound to lose? (Rhetorical question, I've seen them piss away more on less)\n\nThe answer is that the money that would be spent on a General Presidential candidate is going to be wasted money. They are already expecting to lose the Presidency (Yes, they are), so spending money that could be spent defending their other candidates down ballot would logically be a much better use of those funds. (Yes, I also understand the logic word comedy)\n\nIf it was me running the RNC, I would say "fuck it, this guys a poser. Let's make sure we protect what we have now." \n\nThe reason is simple, as Kansas showed yesterday, Tea Party and hard core GOP are now running for their lives. 2016 General election is going to be a bloodbath. The GOP has spent a metric fuck-ton of money for the Presidential race, which they don't have a serious candidate to run in. Sure they could pump McCain full of VItamin B and stand him up there, but aside from that, who are they gonna get? Cheney? hahahahahhahaha. They would be better off putting up Palin. But I digress.....\n\nBest case scenario, instead of waiting for Trump to back out (He will, he wasn't expecting to get this far, and is already giving soundbites for his out), they just withdraw support financially from Trump, and he will drop anyway. Then they use those funds to HOPE to keep what they have now. \n\nWhew.....that was a whole lot of wasted text characters for a party that really is going to get absolutely creamed in the General in Nov.
Everyone is completely overlooking the obvious, and I fail to see why. It's Eppstein. Who also happens to have links to BILL CLINTON. There are plenty of rumors floating around that not only Trump but also Bill flew the sex plane and played on Eppsteins sex island. \n\nThe REASON the media won't go after it is because it will bring down Bill Clinton, and thus Hillary at the same time. It's a complete white wash BECAUSE it isn't just Trump.\n\nWhy this connection is IGNORED when people ask why the media isn't going after Trump on this is beyond me. It's obvious.

I don't think it's an anomaly. I can name the RNC chair, but that's not relevant. Most people don't know who Bill Kristol is either, but that didn't prevent him from being one of the masterminds behind the Iraq war. The email leak proved how influential the DNC administration can be. It's not just DWS, it's Podesta, and Brazile, and all the others involved in regular coercion. I mean, we literally have an email of Podesta telling Gabbard she was getting cut off of funding because she supported Bernie. Gabbard is the one who followed all the rules and resigned her position to endorse a candidate, and they still tried to bully her into submission.\n\nIt's time for us to admit that this has been going on for a long time. Going back through people like Tim Kaine and Howard Dean, I don't see a time when the DNC staff wasn't abusing their authority. Just look at the budgets of state Democratic Parties - the DNC has been funneling money towards themselves for years, picking favorites, and blackballing dissidents. It's a systemic issue, and this race is, potentially, a critical turning point away from those practices. I don't think Keith will bully the party into becoming more progressive, and I don't want him to, but I do think he will make it tougher for malicious stakeholders to control the funding.
What tactic didn't work in 2016? The tactic I see that didn't work was trying to support Hillary despite the fact that she's the definition of unelectable. It's time to try something new, and if the DNC rejects progressives again, we'll have no choice but to leave.
They could lease the land for another use - but not residential. It's not zoned residential.
No, that isn't what happened. Antioch is not the result of forced integration. What a stupid narrative.
That's pretty much where I am, but I'm not going to stop Bernie. I'll still vote for him in 2020. I'm interested in seeing where he goes if Perez wins, though, because I don't know if he could keep telling his supporters that we can reform the party from within.
I've never even flogged.
> The issue, he argued, was not that Trump won the election “so much as the Democratic Party lost the election” by not answering the call of those workers.\n\nThat's funny, I'm pretty sure he called out Hillary specifically.
It's been hell to develop on. I can't rely on my system anymore, it's subject to updates at Microsoft's whim, and I no longer have control over my development environment. It might reboot while a server is running or while it's compiling, and when it comes back, the updates may have introduced new bugs. Active hours usually don't work, and even when they do, my work can't be easily scheduled and fit inside Microsoft's allowed work hours.\n\nI used to think the stability of Linux was overrated, Windows was a much more stable environment for me up through Win7, but now it's the most volatile OS on the market. I'll probably switch development to Linux as soon as Visual Studio runs reliably at full functionality, but I'm still going to need Windows for games and a number of third party utilities. I hate maintaining two computers, so I really think ReactOS would be a good fit for me. I just don't know if it will ever be completed.
It is my home pc, it'll be replacing professional edition. Near as I can tell, Education has all the useful features of professional, only with less telemetry. Work PC is already education.
He doesn't, at least, not among electors who are willing to say who they're voting for. If you count endorsements, I think he hits the triple digits, but most of those can't vote for him. And they don't seem to do much good, either. Googling for his endorsements will return several articles about David Duke endorsing Keith Ellison for DNC chair. A rational person can look at an ex-KKK member supporting a black man's bid for office and see something positive in it, but most won't think through that thoroughly. There's no one I want more than Keith Ellison to be DNC chair, but all the numbers are against him.

How many of those new rules are new regulatory measures? And how many of those new rules are deregulatory measures? You're implying that these are all new rules that didn't exist before, but that's a lie. Adding new laws is how deregulation happens. Congress doesn't have a delete key. Without that information, your graph is less than meaningless.\n\nNumerous articles exist (you can google for them) explaining how deregulation helps established business and hurts the would-be competitors. When you talk to the people closing small businesses, many of them will tell you how the protections that previously prevented bullying tactics from larger businesses have been stripped away (you can google for them, but I suggest going beyond blogspot next time).\n\nIt bothers me that you seem to be absolutely clueless about why I'm not taking you seriously. You made a bad argument and then expected me to provide "sources" when I didn't fall for it. Then you googled for the first thing you could find that appeared to agree with you - this is obvious from the blogspot image. Not only are blogspot and random spreadsheets completely unreliable, you didn't even bother to check what the numbers actually were, and ignorantly assumed that more numbers meant more restrictions.\n\nAccurate information on these issues is hard to find, because the majority of studies are paid for by political think tanks, who are clearly allied to one party or another. Most of the rest come from the CBO or similar, and they're not exactly unbiased either. But this isn't actually a partisan issue. Both Democrats and Republicans understand that deregulation occurred in the 80's and onward. Democrats are fighting against it, and Republicans want more of it, but no one's pretending it didn't happen but you.\n\nIf you're actually interested in learning, and not just copy/pasting blogspot links until the opposition gives up, here's a brief history of Reaganomic deregulation to get you started. But I'm not your professor, and I'm not going to sit here and explain it to you. It's not my obligation to make sure you're educated. I suggest next time you start off with the google search and refrain from posting until you've actually read the information.\n\nhttp://cepr.net/documents/publications/dereg-timeline-2009-07.pdf
You made a baseless accusation.
You forget how progressives were blackballed during the 2016 primaries already?
If Tom Perez wins, I don't think we'll get the chance to vote for progressives.
Well, like I said, in this thread or another, I'm really hoping that Tom Perez is lying about his numbers, and the list of endorsements does hint at that, but those are largely supporters with no voting power, so it's very hard for me to actually believe.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_and_best_use#Legally_permissible\n\nI suggest that next time you actually READ an article before attempting to use it in an argument. But, thanks for helping me out. I certainly wasn't going to look it up.
It depends on your definition of "work", of course, and my definition of working is protecting from residents from danger. I don't know if the man is actually a physical threat or just a scammer, but at this point, I don't care. He's a threat, and yes, jail excels at fixing that problem.\n\nYou seem to be trying to argue that he needs mental therapy or something instead of jail, but you're doing it extremely poorly (and arrogantly). That also has nothing to do with the perspective people are coming at this story from.
The Clintons didn't reinvent the Democratic Party, they just capitalized on the same corruption that had been there for decades. Look at the 1968 Democratic primary, it's a close parallel to 2016. A populist candidate (McGovern) lost against an establishment candidate (Humphrey) in an election that was heavily influenced by the party. The establishment candidate went on to lose to one of the worst candidates to ever come out of the Republican party (Nixon) in a landslide according to electoral votes, but an extremely narrow margin in the popular vote. Just like 2016, the party blamed the populist candidate, claiming he tarnished the image of the establishment candidate during the primary. This is the election that led the DNC to invent superdelegates, with the idea that next time around they'd be able to squash the populist candidate before they ever picked up steam.\n\nThis is what the Clintons took advantage of, but they aren't responsible. This corruption runs very deep. The 2016 election is actually an improvement by comparison, since people are actually questioning the validity of superdelegates, and the authority of anyone who defends them.
If it's not zoned industry, then what is it considered, commerce? There is no way it's zoned for residential purposes, or this would have never been an issue to begin with.
A good portion of my own problems with my commute would be fixed if roads like Old Hickory Blvd and Harding could be widened. It's actually faster to drive several miles around my destination on the interstate than it is to just get off on the road it's on. A lot of people take longer routes on the interstate to avoid the crowd, which then brings the crowd to the interstate, and makes it last much longer.
They're right there, next to the sources you cited when you said that regulations like this are the rule more than the exception. Can't you see them?
800k is a lot more than Tom Perez has.
Your entire argument could easily apply to the word "flow". In fact, I believe that is exactly what the guy you replied to was implying.
I don't think you understand what's happening right now. The Democratic party has been throwing elections because they refuse to actually help the voters they claim to represent. It's not about "ideological purity". If we want to beat Republicans, we have to make sure our party is BETTER than Republicans. And with Hillary Clinton, that wasn't a claim we could honestly make.\n\nWe are cleaning house in the Democratic party because it's the only way to improve things. You're so caught up in Republican vs Democrat that you're blinding yourself to all the evil shit Democrats are doing. I don't want to prop up the rotting body of the Democrats just so they can slide into a position they don't deserve. I want to reform Democrats so they actually deserve the position and serve their members, instead of working for Wall Street.\n\nPerez has been extremely successful at selling out to moneyed interests while staying low enough under the radar that he didn't attract any negative attention from the media. He should not be allowed near a leadership position.
so angry!
I love the idea of ReactOS, especially with the way Windows 10 has turned out, but I won't be willing to use it until it fully supports Visual Studio and Steam. I think that's going to be a long way off.
No, it isn't, at least, not normally. No one else deals with this. That's part of what zoning regulations are for. No one in a corner lot pays higher taxes just because it would be more valuable as a Starbucks.
I probably will, to be honest, but I was doing UWP development for a while, and I don't even know if that can be done on Windows 7 - it definitely can't be tested. Fortunately for me, UWP is a fucking trainwreck, so I won't be doing any more development on it. I will miss the FB Messenger app, but only a tiny bit. It doesn't work very well.\n\nI am a bit worried about support being dropped over the long term, for any software I run, or hardware I might buy in the future, but I can cross that bridge when I come to it a few years from now. That's much, much easier to handle than the headache Microsoft springs on me every 2-3 months right now.
This is a stupid attitude to take. Chrome's massive issues don't make Firefox's any smaller. Both are pretty flawed and I can't blame the man if Chrome works best for him.
Keith Ellison is basically our last hope. He can do a lot of good as DNC chair. It's strange to me how many people are attempting to minimize the importance of the chair after we saw how much influence DWS had over the last election. But if he doesn't win, then progressives have literally no influence in the party whatsoever.\n\nYeah, a third party sounds good, but there isn't a viable one now and there isn't likely to be any time in the next decade. Right now, the only person in the whole country with enough influence to start a progressive party is Bernie Sanders, and he isn't going to do it. We can say that a third party is our only option at that point, but that's really lying to ourselves. In reality, we have no option.
I think they're attacking you for attacking others.
> The issue, he argued, was not that Trump won the election “so much as the Democratic Party lost the election” by not answering the call of those workers.\n\nLove this man
Tom Perez is "progressive" in the same way Hillary is. He joins up with social movements as soon as it's politically convenient, and no sooner. He has no problem with taking money from rich investors who expect favors in return and was solidly behind Clinton. There's nothing remotely progressive about him.
No. I'm saying I'm not going to go out of my way to work up a list because this guy is too lazy to google.
I do work at home that's separate from my job, and I run servers on my home PC. To the best of my knowledge, Microsoft doesn't even sell Enterprise, just license, so I don't have any other options.\n\nEven outside of development, there are several reasons to leave my PC running. I've had my Plex server shut down in the middle of streaming a movie - I guess I was supposed to plan my movie watching around my active hours. I like to RDP into my home PC sometimes if I need some file or something off of there. It's not just development, I don't see how Windows 10 is suitable for anything more powerful than a netbook. It's probably great for the Surface.\n\nActive hours not working is actually a feature. Any update market "Security" gets pushed through. Group policy is ignored, and the update service is restarted automatically. This is all on actual releases. They also like to pull in drivers, even when you tell it not to, which means sometimes I wake up to find my PC unable to use its monitors, or some other absurdity. This is a problem with AMD drivers - but also with the update service that installed them without my permission. It's not common, but it's totally unpredictable, and that's something I just can't tolerate.\n\nI have dozens of other complaints, but this is what pisses me off the most as a developer. Windows used to be a stable development environment, and now, it's just not.
That's not all that funny, to be honest, Edge seems to be outperforming on every PC I try it on. I really don't know why Microsoft isn't improving their available features, they could potentially grab a lot of market share. A LOT of people are frustrated with Chrome.
Unfortunately, 180 of them already said they're going to vote for Perez.

It would be easier and faster to create a new party. If we can't change the party from within, eating at the edges is just delaying the inevitable.
It's not a matter of having "100% of your EXACT SAME BELIEFS ON EVERY ISSUE." That's an absurd straw man.

This is ignorant. I know plenty of Hillary supporters and none of them are paid. The problem is a lot deeper and more difficult to explain than just saying CTR, and we don't make any progress by denying the reality of her support.
There is a global setting to use rebase by default.
Honestly, the capital gains tax should be eliminated and it should be taxed as regular income instead. The only reason the capital gains tax is so low is that it encourages people to pour their savings into the stock market. It looks good in the short-term, but ultimately makes the familiar boom-bust scenarios of the market even more dramatic.
I had a similar problem, and I really thought I had all updates blocked successfully, this time. I'm going to try and update to Education edition to see if that gives me any more control over updates.
Great, he's a conspiracy theorist. That explains a few things.\n\nEven if you weren't making that up about Gabbard trying to get a job in the Trump administration (you are), and even if it were a bad thing (it's not), that would be wholly irrelevant, because Podesta stated exactly why he pulled her funding, and it was because she supported Sanders, and nothing else.\n\nHoly shit, what a ridiculous tangent. You can tell how clueless he is by how drastically he tries to change the subject.
No, it doesn't ignore that fact, it's just a different argument. The 2016 presidential election was lost by Hillary and her team. Her negative press bled over into several other senate and house races, causing a drop in Democratic polls across the board, likely causing candidates like Russ Feingold and Zephyr Teachout to lose their races as well. Yes, the Democratic party has systemic issues, but we won't even get to address them as long as they can successfully blame their loss on racists instead of themselves.
I don't really get what this has to do with productivity. What's with the totally non-descriptive title? There's actual content in the article, so I wouldn't call it clickbait.
I wouldn't even have a problem with obscene wealth if it weren't coming directly at the expense of the poorest in this country. If CEO salary had skyrocketed 50x or whatever the numbers are over the past 30 years, but so had the minimum wage, I don't think anyone would be complaining.
Sure, I could follow the majority, but why would I want to do that?\n\nOr are you assuming I don't vote? If so, fuck you.
No, it doesn't make me feel good at all. I'm not making a statement, I'm just not lying to myself. The DNC has all the control. They vote for their own interests. We tried to change things through the few avenues where we do have control, but the DNC made that impossible. Now we're basically just praying that the DNC makes the right decision going forward, but if they don't, we're totally shut out. There's nothing left we can do.\n\nThat is, within the DNC. A new party isn't going to win in 2020, but it might win in 2024 or 2028, and that's what we're going to have to accept if we ever want to move beyond the politics of the past several decades.
A flat hierarchy is probably best for handling changing requirements, but it's not the most elegant documentation. I'm personally more interested in having solid docs at the moment. Are there at least any good UML tools maybe?

Been here on campus since 730 this morning, didn't hear anything.
I know you're not the one making the argument, but Hillary is the one who lost the election. We can't let Hillary supporters forget that. It's their fault Democrats are in the bad situation they're in. Not us.
The mistake you're making is assuming you have to "go on" anything at all. You don't. Step back for a second and look at your posts. You singled this guy out, pretended he was making an argument based on only the information presented in the topic, and then attacked him for it. That is not how reasonable people act.
Yeah, it's incredibly clear that her terrible reputation was rubbing off on other Democrats. This election wasn't an acceptance of Republicans or their platform as much as it was a rejection of Hillary.\n\nWhenever people say Sanders would have performed worse after Republicans ran their smear campaign against him, I just remind them that Sanders ran against someone even better at smear campaigns than Republicans - he ran against the Clintons.
I'm out of ideas myself. I'm just praying Keith Ellison wins DNC chair and provides enough leadership for the progressives that we can take over the ideological narrative.
It's not my job to educate you. Find your own citation.
>  I don't know if the man is actually a **physical threat**  or just a scammer\n\nGonna need you to actually read the posts you respond to. Also gonna need you to read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing).
You're the one mistaken here. I do have only one job, and twisting around the definitions of words to try and make your point is only making your argument weaker.
I hope this works but I worry that the electors aren't going to care. What really bothers me is that there hasn't been any concerted effort to make the DNC understand that a rejection of Keith Ellison is a rejection of a very large portion of the party, and that we will leave if rejected.
I don't feel bad for PSC or anything, but if I'm reading this article correctly, they took property zoned for industry and appraised it as if it were residential, to squeeze more money out of industry. Exactly what was the legal justification for doing that?
It depends - sometimes you have good players, like the support singed everyone is talking about, who play enough legitimate roles that they maintain a high win rate, but on occasion just troll and play something completely unviable. If elo were capable of being calculated on a per-role or per-role-per-champion basis, then that support singed would have ended up megabronze and found some medium where he wasn't just throwing games for his teammates. But that's not how it works.
I don't know what you mean by a gag order. The candidates for DNC chair are certainly being careful in how they discuss the previous presidential election, but I'm pretty confident that Keith Ellison is against the rigging. He previously called to end superdelegates, though he no longer claims he would personally put an end to them. I'm also pretty confident Tom Perez would be a repeat of DWS. It doesn't bother me that Keith Ellison is being careful, he's trying to win an election.
Bernie brought in plenty of money, and supported more down ballot races than Hillary did
So they can't lease the land for another use, then. Looks like I was right. Why am I getting downvoted again? People in this reddit seem to have an allergy to facts.
We aren't likely to see an influx of progressive primary challenges no matter who gets DNC chair. The support just isn't there.\n\nDon't tell me I won't be able to vote if I unregister as a democrat. That's ignorant.\n\nNo, I"m not issuing an ultimatum. I'm just not lying to myself about the future of the party. We already tried literally everything we could to reform the party, and now we're on our last bet. That's not a threat, that's just the way things are.
But that doesn't appear to be what happened, and there doesn't appear to be any actual reasonable prospect. It's going to stay industrial in the near future and PSC Metals isn't going to use.\n\nYou got caught trying to use a wikipedia article that disagreed with your argument. Don't try to pretend otherwise, we can still see your posts.
This is an incredibly stupid rumor that somehow continues to get propagated. No, you are not required to file absurd litigation to protect your trademark. Losing trademarks over failing to properly protect them is very rare, and to my knowledge, has only happened in cases where owners of trademarks capitalized on their ubiquity and then later attempted to selectively and unfairly enforce trademark, i.e. Aspirin and Zipper. In other words, you can't encourage the use of your trademark to describe the generic version of your product. But there's nothing even remotely generic about the use of "Flow" as applied to the three different products mentioned in this topic.\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet
This is an extremely narrow view of the industry. Each programmer doesn't negotiate his salary relative to the current market rate. Instead, the market rate is determined from the collective of programmers negotiating their salary. It's not just the poor negotiators that are underpaid - it's everyone, and no individual can overcome that. It's a problem that should be addressed, and no amount of personal responsibility will overcome it.\n\nLearning to sell yourself will give you a slight edge over others in your industry. Far from being an "essential life skill".

You're being hostile and you're being met with hostility. There's absolutely nothing ironic or hypocritical about that. You're justifying the response you claim to have received in the past. Now THAT's hypocrisy.
You're talking to a group of people who actually took part in his campaign. Of course we know better than to fall for the "Bernie Bros" myth. People like you are exactly WHY progressives have to distinguish themselves from the establishment.
That's a pretty big assumption you're making. You've singled out this one complaint and now you're pretending it represents the entirety of the TC's knowledge. Many of us here are already familiar with Jim Cooper, his reputation, and many of his positions. If you're not - well, this is a discussion topic. You can ask questions if you're curious.\n\nEdit: Since you're bringing up specific logical fallacies, I'd like to point out that the one you made is called a "Straw man". The TC never argued that Jim Cooper is a bad politician or a bad Democrat based off of two specific issues, but you pretended he did make that argument, and then began to argue against it.
This is probably true, but just because the establishment is minimizing Keith Ellison's support doesn't mean you should too.
Grammar Andrea....grammar.
But if we can't convince Democrats of that fact, we won't make any progress. I do feel like a lot of swing voters and moderates are a bit miffed at Hillary now, but most of the hardline Democrats are steadfastly refusing to admit Hillary had any flaws at all.
You aren't a very comprehensive reader.
I suggest in the future you don't make things up in order to insult the visitors of the thread you're reading.
I think you're probably right. Keith has more support for sure. [A quick look at endorsements proves that.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_chairmanship_election,_2017) But DNC chair is elected by an extremely small and selective subgroup of members of the Democratic Party. It is both possible and profitable for them to push Tom Perez through and completely shut out progressives.\n\nAt this point, I'm just hoping that the several senators, representatives, and governors that have endorsed Ellison are putting more pressure on the DNC than we can see (which is very possible), and that Tom Perez is lying about how many votes he already has (this is much less likely).
Let me get out my shop checker
He's pretty bad, but more importantly is the fact that he's going to continue DNC business as usual, which is exactly what led us to Trump in the first place. That makes him one of the biggest obstacles to improving this country and the lives of the people in it.
Excuse me, but this reddit is down with OPP.
Introspection is fine, but I don't see any mistakes in his platform. It's true that some Bernie supporters took things too far, and we could improve that, but that wasn't a key factor in why they lost, which is clear when you look at how shitty the supporters of Trump and Hillary acted. It's no surprise to see Bernie supporters refusing to support Hillary in the general when you see how they were treated in the primary. Just look at the "Bernie Bros" myth, a continuation of the "Obama Boys" smear campaign in 2008. By comparison, Bernie and his supporters were downright noble. I would much sooner complain that Bernie refused to criticize Hillary's behavior, even when she deserved it, than complain about his supporters.
There's varying degrees of this - some people are just frustrated with the fact that they put in 60+ hours a week in the brutal finance industry to make 300-400k and have to choose between paying the mortgage on their second home and the tuition for their child's private school.\n\nI know how little sympathy that evokes in people who struggle to pay their one mortgage, or just to pay rent, but they're victims too, in a way. It's not just the poor and lower-middle class that's making less money than they should be. It's basically everyone who isn't in the uppermost tier, the ones Bernie refers to when he says "one tenth of one percent." I wouldn't ask you to try and sympathize with them, but we shouldn't try to make them our enemies when we're essentially on the same side.
Who exactly do you think he's talking about when he says that the Democratic Party failed to capture voters? Do you think he's talking about Donna Brazile?
I have, but sometimes you need to move items from parents to children, or vice versa, and that can be tedious, depending on the size of the domain.
That's not much of a consolation when we have no viable alternative and their only competition is the Republican party.
They have extremely heavy influence over things like budgets and elections. Did you not see how effectively DWS and Podesta were able to blackball progressives in their own party? Podesta successfully pulled funding from Tulsi Gabbard because she followed the rules and resigned her chair position before endorsing Bernie Sanders. The idea that the chair has no real power is a really stupid rumor and it needs to be laid to rest.
If Perez wins DNC chair, there will be no possibility to seek reform. This is our last chance. After this, there's nothing left.
We may see Ellison as the unity candidate, but Democrats do not. They're looking for someone to bridge a gap that can't be bridged, and that's the gap between moneyed interests and the progressives. They see Tom Perez as that person in much the same way Obama was and they believed Hillary would be. People like Podesta and Brazile and DWS would get to keep their privileged positions in the DNC, and they'd retain the ability to do things like deny funding to Tulsi Gabbard because she didn't follow the inner circle's plans.\n\nAs it stands, Ellison doesn't appear to have a chance. Tom Perez has roughly 3/4ths of the votes he needs to secure a win from just the voters who have publicly stated their vote. Ellison's endorsements are in the double digits, but he doesn't seem to have the votes needed.
I dunno if it will fracture the supporters. Fracture the party, sure.
Bernie's organizers were not downright hostile. They were literally the most well-behaved organizers of any presidential campaign in 2016. Now you're just trash-talking Bernie supporters for no reason. I can see exactly why someone might prevent you from working on a progressive campaign.
Wasn't talking to you. Dems are better, period. I'm personally in favor of globalism and capitalism. I just also believe in the Democratic Platform: equality, drug reform, criminal justice reform, cop body cams, affordable education, helping climate change, etc.

I've called my KY senators a couple times to object. Please program your senator's number in your phone 
And I quoted the counter augment. Which one is correct? Experts say both, neither, and/or a little of both. Fact: the bill was bipartisan, and Bill Clinton was the last Prez to balance to the budget.

Im not a trump supporter.  Im a bernie supporter.  The democratic establishment is on board with goldman sachs and so is trump.  :/\n\nYouve made my original point for me.  Thanks.
Did you read the entire wiki? How about this section:\nAccording to a 2009 policy report from the Cato Institute authored by one of the institute's directors, Mark A. Calabria, critics of the legislation feared that, with the allowance for mergers between investment and commercial banks, GLBA allowed the newly-merged banks to take on riskier investments while at the same time removing any requirements to maintain enough equity, exposing the assets of its banking customers.[33][non-primary source needed] Calabria claimed that, prior to the passage of GLBA in 1999, investment banks were already capable of holding and trading the very financial assets claimed to be the cause of the mortgage crisis, and were also already able to keep their books as they had.[33] He concluded that greater access to investment capital as many investment banks went public on the market explains the shift in their holdings to trading portfolios.[33] Calabria noted that after GLBA passed, most investment banks did not merge with depository commercial banks, and that in fact, the few banks that did merge weathered the crisis better than those that did not.[33]\n\nIn February 2009, one of the act's co-authors, former Senator Phil Gramm, also defended his bill:\n\n[I]f GLB was the problem, the crisis would have been expected to have originated in Europe where they never had Glass–Steagall requirements to begin with. Also, the financial firms that failed in this crisis, like Lehman, were the least diversified and the ones that survived, like J.P. Morgan, were the most diversified. Moreover, GLB did not deregulate anything. It established the Federal Reserve as a superregulator, overseeing all Financial Services Holding Companies. All activities of financial institutions continued to be regulated on a functional basis by the regulators that had regulated those activities prior to GLB.[34]\n\nBill Clinton, as well as economists Brad DeLong and Tyler Cowen have all argued that the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act softened the impact of the crisis.[35][36] Atlantic Monthly columnist Megan McArdle has argued that if the act was "part of the problem, it would be the commercial banks, not the investment banks, that were in trouble" and repeal would not have helped the situation.[37] An article in the conservative publication National Review has made the same argument, calling liberal allegations about the Act “folk economics.”[38] A New York Times financial columnist and occasional critic of GLBA stated that he believes GLBA had little to do with the failed institutions.[39]

Agreed. Especially for controllers that like to break. Had terrible luck with the Lunar White
First: if you support those achievement then mention that well flaying them alive. The way to help progressive laws to be passed is to support the party, as best possible, who actually introduce them. Shit talking non-stop about every party, even though Dems push a platform you prefer, does NOT help progress society in a more fair and equitable way. All shit talking does is turn people off to what you have to say next, to further perpetuate a feeling of powerlessness. Neither of those helps anyone.\n\nSecondly, I have a MBA (masters of business admin) and an undergrad degree in management. I've studied a lot. I've looked at the data. The data shows there is Value in SPECIALIZATION. Google that word. Basically that means that I would prefer work to be done in most efficient and effective way. We make great software, airplanes, and produce food in America. We do NOT make the best value manufacturing. So economist, and I, argue....let Mexico make the shirts, we make the planes. Now, I believe if we enforce international labor standards (let them get paid a decent wage, etc), them they can afford to fly and Mexican companies can buy our planes. Do Google the above word to learn more. \n\nThe system of specialization and globalism does create winners (we get cheap shit), but it also creates losers (we don't make that cheap shit), but from an economic stand point we are better off. The world as a whole is better off. I am NOT hyper nationalistic. I want the whole world to do well...China, Mexico, Brazil, etc. as well. All of US. Because Chinese folks make our shit now they can actually eat meat now (Google: Chinese meat consumption). Millions of Chinese have pulled themselves from the depths of famine. That means a lot to me. \n\nI could go on for hours, but I won't. \n\nCompetition between businesses leads to innovation...which leads to better lives for every human....as long as we regulate some of the inherent greed. Capitalism is the best form of gov in my book. It's why we are #1 in many world metrics for wealth. Problem, the GOP won't allow us to invest back in the people and I believe in a very strong social safety net. The GOP have controlled Congress (which actual makes the laws) for the last 6 years. No major investments in education, and Obama's JOBS programs were all killed (Google it). But, the vile vile Dems (lol) did get Net Neutrality passed to stem greed, yay, and we gave Eliz. Warren the CFPB, which just busted Wells Fargo greed, yay...and they've also done other great things. Dems passed Dodd-Frank Wallstreet Bill, yay. But, ALL that great shit is at risk. Because our progressive, liberal, and centrist Dem coalition NEEDS to do better. Unite, register voters, and turn them out. And volunteer, and donate.  \n\nI will shit talk Dems to, but I will ALWAY educate on why they are the best choice at the ballot box. Questions?
Devos is unqualified. I oppose as well
Also, refurbished Kinects are sold at GameStop. Will need adapter. Not sure if free anymore thru MS
I'm calling today. Thanks 
Hell yes we do. Trump IS the swamp. What did he promise Russia?

Terrible
Furthermore, and I don't know if you're even American, my education and healthcare came directly from Dems. My gay friends can get married because of them. I understand you don't have a party to call your own but you don't need to shit on mine. Thanks
Mid-term voting is in 2 years!!! Prepare to help put a check on his power. We HAVE to flip Congress to the Democrats. Donald is way worse than advertised.
Glad. They need to fix the "safety concerns" with the bill and pass it!
Hecks yes. Was apprehensive but the explaination is perfect. Hype!
He actually opposes repealing the ACA without a replacement because of the harms it causes. His assistant seems to listen. Call me up. I am too :)
Yes

Cool\n
Its not a strike, its a sick day.  
Im calling it right now.  ALL of the candidates except for ellison and sam ronan, ran to extract concessions from perez in exchange for their supporters votes.  \n\nthats how this fucked up party works.  Ellison doesnt stand a damn chance.  
 Rural whites are VERY receptive to bernies economic message.  We wouldnt know that though because the democrats have no economic message.  We should primary them with an economic progressive messenger then show them how social issues are interconnected with economic issues later in the campaign.  
Fuck trudeau.  Hes canadas barack obama.  A pretty boy fake to the core.  Just watch.

yup!
sweet summer child...

Trumps election kickstarted a revolution and woke people up to how bad our government is.
Im iranian american but look white.  You wouldnt believe how many white women told me to check my white male privilege and vote for clinton because trump would be bad fpr minorities.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Im voting for the feminist that doesnt want to bomb my home country!  Its better trump won because at least people will protest his decision to bomb innocent muslims and instigate war w iran.  Clinton wouldnt have had any resistance to bombing iran for the oil companies and banking cartels.  
Susan sarandon was right though. 
no no, we suck weiners in the infantry too, we just do it as a prank.  
You would think that but you would also be surprised at how popular bernie samders is there.  Class consciousness is how we appeal to rural whites.  They know the struggle to survive and we can use that to our advantage.  If we appeal to them with economics, we can eventually educate them on racial, gender, and sexual issues later.  
schumer, pelosi,dws, most of the democratic party, etc...

Based mods are based.
Share it if you want.  Im desperately trying to change the national conversation on the middle east.  Even liberals get caught up in the bullshit like bill maher.  
Are you sure thats what hes asking?  Is he upset because she had a fling on a cruise before the got together?  It would be weird to be upset by it, but ive seen weirder. 
Fuck this.  Shes right.  Answer me this, whats more racist banning innocent brown people or bombing innocent brown people amd calling it justified?  \n\nFuck these people that use civil rights and social justice to deflect criticism for all the corrupt shit the democrats do.  
I didnt say it was a conspiracy.  Just look at what happened to the progressive wave that elected obama and gave democrats both houses.  They got elected then betrayed the values they ran on.  That betrayal and the refusal to correct course kept them losing until 2016.  Democrats arent a progressive party to push progressive policies, their only function is to sheepdog left populism back into the fold of neoliberalism.  They would rather lose to a republican than win with a real progressive.  I dont want to see that happen again.  
Sanders IS more of a feminist than clinton.  Is it feminist to destroy the third world?  Fuck them all and their identity politics.  I hate identity politics but love social justice.  Social justice empowers those whose issues are being raised, identity politics exploits the oppressed and empowers the oppressors.  I wrote a letter to the dnc and sam ronan is giving it to the candidates in atlanta.  Its about this very topic:https://medium.com/@bijansharifi/a-letter-to-the-dnc-from-a-first-generation-iranian-american-and-u-s-7bfb558130eb\n\n
Only the ny times is out of touch enough to blame clintons loss on third parties (wtf is fourth parties?) and never me tion jill stein and gary johnson by name. \n\nThis is why the old media is trash.
i cant afford obamacare as it is.  Youre fighting for some bullshit republican plan in the short term and what susan sarandon is saying that trumps awfulness is better in the long term.  Trump is the death of both party establishments.  We need drastic reform if the planet is going to survive and trumps awfulness will wake enough people up to get us there.  Its a valid argument and calling it white privilege is stupid and actually hurts the cause of social justice when you attack people in that way.  \n\nClinton voters need to check their first world privilege and look at the damage neoliberals have done all over this planet.
I like it!  Why has our national union leadership not been kicking up a bigger fuss over her?  They should have called a national sick day or something before her confirmation.  :/\n\nThey need change at the top in our unions.  Theyre too inside the insiders club to be effective.
So submit a text post w the link inside?  Do i submit to mod team via "message the mods" or just submit to the subreddit? 
Yet they spent an entire segment asking why islam is dealing with fundamentalism but ignored how america has suppressed democracy and liberalism in the islamic world to further its imperialist agenda.  Its bullshit and bill maher should know better.  Fuck him, hes a liberal gatekeeper and i dont give one fuck about his orientalist white mans burden opinion.   
ITT kids that went to good schools and had involved parents.  Good on everyone all around!
The McResistance brought to you by the deep state, goldman sachs, and the establishment wing of the Democratic party. \n\nEdit: Weird. before when this post had only 50 upotes i had -15 downvotes for this comment.  Now its at +15.  I dont usually care about votes but that seems odd.
Wat?
democrats have been making this mistake for too long.  we lost working class whites in the first place by moving to the center.  they used to be pro union leftists but now theyre conservatives.  its time to bring them back into the fold.  we have the benefit of being right that will help us.
Im not a union bigwig and i thought of that.  How the hell did they not think of it?  Maybe they did but didnt want to rock the boat.  Maybe they are secretly on board with privatization like devos.  Look at corey booker: he was at devos's organization AFC a year ago saying how proud he was to have her support.  With democrats like these, who even needs republicans?
If you want to post the letter to the top, i would be extremely grateful.  
I like how i invented an academic term from Wikipedia. I think thats the best part of your comment.  Somebody submit this to r/bestof and r/depthhub real quick.  Your comment is a reddit goldmine. 
That music is disrespectful. 
That means he has broader appeal than what centrist dems have. 
She cant promise to vote against trumps Supreme Court nominee?  I already hated her, but this is too much.
ellison is there to sheepdog leftist populist anger back into the dnc and into irrelevance.  watch, he'll get elected then waffle on the reforms we want.  theyll change things around the perimeter to create the illusion of reform but in all actuality, no reform will happen.  
Either the writing is on the wall for establishment dems and theyre smart enough to see it, or keith is offering the illusion of reform.\n\nPossibly both.
This is the same mistake democrats have been making for too long.  Appeal to rural whites with a progressive economic message.  Educate them on social justice after getting their attention.  
Fuck bill maher.  He and sam harris had a typical orientalist and white mans burden conversation on islam two weeks ago that i found extremely offensive and regressive.  He should be shunned from the progressive movement.  He is no friend to our revolution comrades.  Lets boycott this fucker and all that go on his show.  Shut this bitch down and say NO MORE to the liberal gatekeepers!!!!
Mike lofgren was on bill moyers talking about it here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EYS647HTgks
You can demonstrate that?  Hmm.  I didnt know there was evidence saying that the cia didnt help start the arab spring there.  You have a link? 
Ahh.  My bad.  Ouch. 
Or blek le rat.  Or a shit ton of other artists.  Stencil art like this is more about the message than style/aesthetic.  Is it executed well and have a powerful message that makes the giewer think but is easily digestible?  Then its good art.
Well, why the hell is that the case?  There has been no focus on the democrats and their out of touch policies.  Thats a really bad thing because they need to get in touch really friggin quick if we want to keep our democracy.
theyre similar in the sense that they all used to be the same country under different historical empires.  I think egyptians and syrians would feel uncomfortable with your assessment though.  \n\nWe have tulsi gabbard out there saying the cia is arming the rebels (and by extension al nusra/qaeda). I dont think its a stretch to consider that the cia sent anti government instigators in during the arab spring.  
NO.\n\n
> This is a total waste and should not be protested. Barack Obama is out, and this is just something to argue over. Look at how Republicans do it. I thoroughly disagree with protesting this.\n\nThat attitude is problematic.  We MUST point out democratic hypocrisy because it is what allowed trump to happen.  Trump has been empowered by obamas actions and we must confront that.\n\nThis was the approach obama took on dealing with the crimes of the bush administration.  Trump can now advocate torture and murdering families of suspected terrorists because obama wanted to look forward. \n\nFurther, your dismissal of my point is emblematic of the patronizing approach liberals take when dealing with middle eastern issues.  "Shut up and focus on trump" isnt going to defeat trump.    \n\n
Democrats should be examining how this human clown shoe beat their "most qualified candidate ever".  Ill do the entire medias job on trump right now so you dont have to pay attention to his bullshit anymore: he is evil, his supporters are nazis, and we should impeach him asap.\n\nOk good, glad thats over.  Now lets clean up the corruption in the democratic party.
So far.  Bernie must have cut a deal w schumer.  
And obama was being funded by them too.  They were all over his administration.  What im saying is the real issue.  No matter who we elect, we still get the vampire squid.
the daughter of the kuwaiti ambassador giving false testimony about iraqi soldiers kiling babies... george bush sr should be in jail for that.  both bush's lied the country into war. people forget that.  
Hes hopefully not.  Hopefully ellison is thinking what this guy is saying.  Hopefully ellisons recent waffling on reform is him just playing the game.
yall should read this.  im spamming the same link probably in an annoying way, but i have something to say dammit.  lol: https://medium.com/@bijansharifi/a-letter-to-the-dnc-from-a-first-generation-iranian-american-and-u-s-7bfb558130eb#.t0cv6nov0
Yeah, why are they taking billionaires money then act like they're a peoples party?  The right has an honest point even though they are the kings of that.  The dems would change the entire narrative in politics if they swore off corporate dollars and billionaires money.  They could brand the republicans as the billionaire party and win.  Dollars dont vote.
This is actually funny here.  
I ate a pork chopra sandwhich.  
We need a peace movement in this fucked up country again.  I wrote this as a former infantryman and forst generation iranian american: https://medium.com/@bijansharifi/a-letter-to-the-dnc-from-a-first-generation-iranian-american-and-u-s-7bfb558130eb#.qk8ke6lta
You need to watch "untold history of the united states" on netflix.  Truman was the cory booker of his time.  Total corporate tool and enemy to progressivism.  Super racist too.
Mouth is off center. 
Stand up.  Have someone try to slide a pencil under your heel while you are standing.  If it fits under there, you need new boots. 
You get it.  Theres the real resistance and the fake one that helped trump happen in the first place.  
Thats a painting?
Youre awesome btw.  You dont understand how desperately i want to get this message out there.  I cant allow myself and other iranian americans to be exploited by the establishment democrats 
well, you have a point.  i never felt that in danger though.  mostly just betrayed my beliefs to avoid harassment.  i couldve been beat up at worst, but i was pretty outgoing so people liked me for the most part.  lets just say i didnt volunteer my ethnicity.  
I didnt downvote you.  As far as insults, i felt insulted by your comment.  It was not my intent to insult you, but reflect how your comment there made me feel.  
Hello from SA columbus!  Please read this article about dem hypocrisy on the muslim ban and war on terror.  Ive been feeling like dems have been exploiting my ethnicity for political points: https://medium.com/@bijansharifi/a-letter-to-the-dnc-from-a-first-generation-iranian-american-and-u-s-7bfb558130eb#.2omdmpo4k
God forbid the muslim world develop liberalism and a vision in which the muslim world wasn't explicitly protecting american corporate interests.  What you and bill maher ignore is that the middle east WAS developing progressive movements until the united states crushed them and installed dictators during the cold war.  Islamic fundamentalism is a response to democracy being suppressed and the people being oppressed.  God forbid we look critically at ourselves first.  Fuck off.
"... this unity scheme was successful in consolidating the shaky Syrian identity. In fact, once the Syrians lost their independence they suddenly realized that they did indeed possess a different identity than the Egyptians."
This is fucked up.  Whoa.  I wonder if you can be america in this game and fund al nusra and let saudi arabia fund and train isis.  
I will cheerlead democratic losses until they deserve to win.  FTW
This guy is still getting it wrong.  The media IS too focused on trump but only because it is heresy to point out democratic establishment corruption.  They cant defeat trump if their side of the street isnt clean.  The media spent the entire primaries and general elections shilling for clinton and theyre paying the price.  Fuck em.  Old media needs to die a quick painful death.
Establishment Democrats are guilty in this too: https://medium.com/@bijansharifi/a-letter-to-the-dnc-from-a-first-generation-iranian-american-and-u-s-7bfb558130eb#.2omdmpo4k
Yes.
The united states armed, trained, and funded, al qaeda to fight the russians in Afghanistan.  Yes, terrorism is Americas own damn fault.  Gtfo out with your bullshit.  \n\nThe cartels wouldnt exist without Americas drug war.  Thats a fact.  If we had legalized and regulated drugs instead of criminalizing, there would be no drug war violence.  \n
The same people slamming sarandon for white privilege are the same people supporting the imperialist way obama prosecuted the war on terror.  The establishment dems at all the muslim ban protests are fucking hypocrites.  Meanwhile you have civil rights groups prostituting their organizations out to telecoms to end net neutrality.  This culture at the dnc is hurting the causes of civil rights and social justice, not helping.  It was bullshit during the election to say that to stein supporters, and its bullshit now.  
"Helping the poor isnt a priority".  No duh.  Look at how greedy christians have become in the realm of politics.  The christian right elected a blasphemer because a liberal would have been a step too far.  SMH.  Its obvious that the loudest voices representing christianity are doing the most harm in becoming relevant to you g people.  What millenial wants to screw over working people to help the rich and hate gays?  
i think hes asking if there is racism and sexual harrassment in the mexican army.  EO is EQUAL OPPURTUNITY, I forget what SHARP means.  i got out in 2005. 
Man, youre not the sharpest spoon in the toolshed are you?  
not primarying the most conservative of the party.  we CAN appeal to rural white america if we push the economic message.  once we do that, we can show how its connected to issues of race, sexuality, and gender issues.  Establishment dems DONT have an economic message to run on, so they run on social issues alone.  it causes rural whites to tune out because they interpret it as hostile to their traditional conservative beliefs.  if we show that we are FOR them first, we win them back and then convert them to be more accepting and tolerant of others.  
So are trump supporters but nobody is telling them to check their privilege, instead of telling her to check her privilege and attacking befnie supporters clintonites should keep their eyes on the enemy and attack trump.\n\nSee how that dumbass argument works?
With fuckhead democrats like this, who even needs republicans 
We should all mail poop to the dnc.  
Who could blame me, but was it morally correct to take advantage of white supremacy culture?  No, its never right to do that.  :/
no, not at all.  im saying that the loudest voices within the resistance to trump are the same people that allowed trump to happen.  trumps election was a rejection of neoliberalism (and an embrace of nationalism and racism to be sure, but not 100%).  now we have the old power structure co-opting grassroots resistance to trump (like womens march, airport protests) and imposing their voices onto that grassroots.  the real left has two enemies right now: trump, and establishment democrats that are wall st servants.  we have to beat back those that would co-opt the grassroots resistance and sheepdog it back into business as usual, before we defeat trump.  if the berniecrats lose the fight on the left, we wont get the change we need, and it makes defeating trump less likely.  why would anyone go to a nancy pelosi or chuck schumer rally?  the same old bullshit from the dems isnt going to work.  we'll see what happens.  anyways, thats why i said McResistance.  
Democratic socialist yes.
Thanks! 
Makes my anxiety worse.  Try kratom instead.  r/kratom has a list of online vendors.  Mix it with orange juice and drink.
> Leave Manchin and Heidcamp alone\n\nclarifying in context to the original post in our comment chain. 
Did bernie sanders recently change his name and start dressing differently?
Sam Ronan FTW!!!  Ellison is waffling on reform. 
His presence gives voice to what the bernie movement is thinking.  He also keeps ellison from drifting too far into compromise w the establishment.  The voting members need to hear the truth of what hes saying.  Theyre still in their bubble and someone needs to pop it.  
that also means that we shouldnt condemn an entire religion with a billion people because we have suppressed liberalism in those regions.  \n\nfrom wiki:\n"Orientalism is an academic term, used in art history, literary studies, geography, and cultural studies, which is and describes a critical approach to representations of the Orient; of the Eastern cultures of the Middle East, North Africa, South West Asia, and South East Asia, represented as “European knowledge of the Orient”\n\nthe academic discourse of critical theorists featured the term Orientalism in applications particular to the variety of cultural imperialism imposed upon the societies of the Near East, which is the cultural hegemony that politically justifies Western imperialism. The praxis of cultural imperialism reduces (essentializes) those societies as culturally static and intellectually undeveloped; the fabrication of cultural superiority is that Oriental culture is a thing (an Other) that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit to the orientalist fabrication is the culturally opposite idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and thereby superior, whilst Oriental societies are inferior for being undeveloped, irrational, and inflexible."
So thats not happening to white people too?  Wtf? Anyways, america deserves trump for allowing obama to continue bush's imperialist wars.  
Tim black at the end of the article roasting them all.  Lol

No dedicated servers.\n\nThat right there is a huge indicator that they aren't going to invest much into it. Combine that with the knowledge that the ME3 multiplayer was rather popular, if they had something similar to it, they'd be using it as a major selling point already. It's about a month away and they're still using guerilla marketing strategies of only offering glimpses. All of this doesn't lead to confidence in the product. Once again, I really hope I'm wrong here.\n\nAnd I didn't know this was a downvote if you disagree sub. Guess I do now.
Oh wow, I was unaware! \n\nBut yeah, still not in the same league as the company I work for. By a significant magnitude.

Morality is the foundation of ethics. Morality is the understanding of right and wrong and the foundation of our ethical views, for both the individual and a group/society. \n\nAnd you're also confusing a full time job with someone who contributes full time to society. Ignoring the fact that society doesn't consider someone who isn't contributing to society full time as unethical. I'm not sure where you picked that concept up from, but it sounds like the sort of propaganda people use against automation. "If people don't work they're worthless!" It's just unfounded nonsense.

Maybe lay off the video games though.

No. Uber is not a multi-billion dollar company.
Like I said, I don't know if that was canon or not. It may have been my DMs interpretation of the setting. It always worked nicely for us though as it created a fairly safe place, as long as you stayed out of the lower quarters. It did bungle a few of my plans as I was the party wizard. \n\nIt made me feel like just another adventurer, if that makes sense. As an adventurer, you should feel different than the common NPCs, but in the grand scheme of things your level four character isn't anything spectacular. Sure, you're far more capable of dealing with the nasties in the world than Farmer MacFuckstick would be, but you're no Mordenkainen, Arnd, or Quaal.

John McCain wants to add $120 million to our military budget, but that's okay because we're going to cut $10 million from this arts program.
Personally was never sold on the whole "Russian Cyberattack" story. It seems silly and feels like they're trying to blow up this honestly really small scale thing into a big issue to distract or excuse themselves of wrongdoing (possibly restart an old rivalry that will help our war industry economy which usually the way we get out of a recession which may or not be coming).\n\nAlso I don't think Wikileaks is posting Pro-Russia/Trump stuff as much as being petty and smug that no one's really proving them wrong as much as shit talking them.

I really wish the Democrats would give up the "crossing the aisle" shtick. Its clear as day that it is never going to happen and it makes them look foolish/ sends the wrong message.

I'm not sure he's actually officially apart of the party yet and if he is he wasn't for that long. Bernie mainly got his boost in popularity because of his platform in the 2016 election compared to Clinton who was like part of the Democratic Brand. If he stays with the DNC till 2020 then he'll be able to carry more weight inside the party and wouldn't be seen as such an outsider stepping on toes. Then he'll be a co-worker stepping on toes.
I think you spelled petition wrong

How are they acting as though Perez is the front runner based on endorsements, when Keith Ellison has way more. They even put Ellison's picture on the top of the article and ended it with his quote. 
Alright this might take a while. "They tried. Some got outed. Others ignored." What kind of non-answer is that? I'll take it further, the only pushback we got from the Intel community on Iraq was Joe Wilson expressing serious doubt about the yellowcake story, other than that the IC went along and touted the lies of Bush and Cheney. The IC didn't leak even a quarter of what they leaking now, compared to their silence during the Iraq War. "There is not incentive to withhold during a normal presidency." What the hell is a "normal presidency"? Obama killed hundreds, possibly thousands including Americans, helped or attempted to overthrow at least 3 countries(Libya, Ukraine and Syria), expanded the Domestic Surveillance program to levels, Bush could have only dreamed of and people think Obama's presidency was some tranquil walk in the park. There is no such thing as a "normal presidency", whatever the fuck that means. You can talk about incentives all you want to, but the very real possibility still remains that the IC have been withholding and sharing only the intel that benefits that particular agency's agenda. Which leads me to your line about how they compete against each other which is true, but they don't compete over who can find the most truths and do it the fastest. They compete over who gets a larger share of the defense budget, so they conjure external threats(very few are real) and claim they are the agency to stop it. Secondly, Iraq isn't the first time that the IC has been caught lying to Americans, do I even have to bring up the former head of the NSA, James Clapper committing perjury on national television when he lied(terribly) to the Senate Intelligence Committee about whether the US government was spying millions of Americans? The IC didn't leak and warn us about that, it took someone who wasn't even employed with the government but instead employed with a contractor to warn us that the government with the help of the IC, was spying on us like the enemy. As far as Trump and his cabinet's Russia connections, the most I can tell though doing my own research and not just swallowing whatever the media tells me is that oligarchs like getting together and pillaging whatever country they can, in this case American oligarchs hooked up with Russian oligarchs, just like other American oligarchs hook up with European, Middle Eastern, Latin American and Asian oligarchs to pillage wherever they can. Now I do believe Putin has knocked off political enemies through various means(I'm referring to your "bodies in Moscow" line) but I don't believe every single person that dies who didn't like Putin was killed by him, that's ridiculous. As far as Ukraine, you do know that most of the fighting take place in Eastern Ukraine, you know the home of the separatists, so why would the separatists or Russia, be shelling their own citizens? Riddle me this Batman. So it's more likely that the Ukrainian Army, you know the one supported by the west, are the ones shelling those civilians but of course you'll never hear our media talk about that loudly. Finally these same news articles who insinuate that Trump and his cabinet are Russian plants will turn around in the very same articles say there is no evidence of Russian state corroboration, or that investigations have been on going so far nothing has been found. I shit you not, I saw a headline from a mainstream article say "Mattis says 'Russia did intervene in election'" then that same day in another mainstream article say that an Intel official said there is no evidence that Russia interfered in the election. They have no evidence to back up their lies and they can't even get their lies right. Look, all I can tell you is quit accepting everything the media and government says without question, both have been caught lying to you in the past and will lie to you in the future if it serves their interest. Now I have to go take a shower after spending 10 minutes defending Trump, though he is a slim ball, tool of the oligarchs, he ain't no Russian plant, so far as the evidence or lack of evidence suggest. Its all just insinuation but it seems that is enough for some people like the Dems, who look a lot like the Republicans during Benghazi.

Funny, my father was over today and we were talking about the company and I made some comment about this supervisor and his history and the very first thing my dad said was about the Catholic church. \n\nIt's exactly the same and it's horrid behavior. I'm looking for a new job, as I can't tacitly agree with this amoral practice. People of good conscious don't just continue on with their day like nothing is wrong.

Gillibrand wants to be the clone of Clinton and is pitching herself as such. (NY senator, friend of Wall-Street, woman, etc.) She went after Clinton's donors the minute she lost and the Dems want her because she a "fundraising superstar" since clearly that's what the failed billion dollar campaigns of Clinton and Jeb taught us. She's known to be kinda cold to people that she doesn't think will donate to her.

If I could manage that I'd be completely in. Unfortunately I'm in the very old category of mid thirties and staying up twenty-four hours is a near impossibility anymore. In my youth, so long ago, my record was seventy-five hours straight, and that included going out to parties, clubbing, and a funeral. Lots of booze, some heavy base-thumping music, and a few friends who just knew they weren't going to be keeping up.\n\nGood times. If you run across a time machine, hit me up fifteen years ago. We'll have a real blast I promise. :D

Yup.\n\nHammer, nail, on the head. 
Moral spiked after he was removed, that's for certain.\n\nI've no idea why they're protecting him.
Looks like the multi-player isn't going to be anywhere near as good as ME3. That's a HUGE negative. ME3 multiplayer was the bomb. \n\nOh well. Maybe they'll fix it, maybe they will pull their heads out of their asses for ME5.

I've noticed you guys have been sprucing things up in here.\n\nI like how the sub is still reminiscent of the anime opening's motifs, but as someone else said the place could do with a spot of color. Maybe something red at the top, even though things become more colorful as you scroll down the banner is the first thing you see. \n\nBTW I really like the new Yato-Setsu pic at the very bottom! I do miss seeing the trio smiling all happily there, but you get see them on the new welcome sign so I guess it balances out.\n\nBasically great job guys!

Like they pointed out in the video, and like that recently released transcript of a DNC meeting shows, they're okay losing to republicans. It doesn't matter if you're an R or a D, you're a corporate stooge first and foremost. 
I've never seen that.\n\nI need one.\n\nThank you so much! :D
If you can get your hands on any of the older Greyhawk stuff, that'd probably help you out a lot. Look for the Atlas of the Flanness I believe it was called. It's a 2nd edition guide to Greyhawk. It's fantastic, but it's more about the setting than the City in and of itself, but I do believe it has a fairly nice section in there. \n\nI'll see if I can scrounge up my copy here shortly. Kudos to you for playing in Greyhawk. There really isn't a better setting. It's where D&D was made to be played. :D 
It's okay to be scared of being hurt. It's okay to not want to feel the pain of embarrassment and disappointment. \n\nIt's not okay to belittle and browbeat yourself into not risking those things. \n\nMy honest advice to you is to tell him you're terrified of him not liking you and of being awkward around him. If he likes you he will understand. If he likes you he will be patient, supportive, and reassure you that when you're quiet and you don't know what to say, that he's just happy that you're being quiet and don't know what to say while sitting next to him.\n\nI know this is asking you to take a GIGANTIC step out of yourself and your comfort zone, and you might not be able to do it, but if I were in your shoes that's what I would push myself to do. You could write a note, give it to him, and run. \n\nAs someone who spends way too much time in my own head, I'm rooting for you girl. You deserve to be happy, even when it's you standing in the way of you being happy. Good luck! :D\n\nEdit: P.S.: I hate your username. You aren't dumb, you're human. You wrote in complete sentences with a clear grasp of the language, while conveying what you wanted to say with perfect clarity. This might seem completely unrelated but it's a big pet peeve of mine. You are the only person you'll have to live with for every moment of every day for the rest of your life. You need to learn to love yourself. Again, you've got this! It just takes a lot of effort and determination to face those fears and those horrible anxieties head on and not all of us can do it alone. Isn't that why you came here? \n\nSmart move, if you ask me.
This almost makes me forget that she finds male rape victims funny.
Someone should do a Derrick Rose pic photo shopped onto a Where's Waldo page. LOL.
It depends on what part of Oerth the necromancer was from. If he's in the Empire of Iuz, he's going to have to be a cut-throat type that's used to defending himself. It's an empire of the strong and, regardless of class, you had best be able to show your might. He would almost be required to have a small retainer of undead bodyguards. \n\nOtherwise though, a necromancer who starts amassing too much power is going to draw attention, and not the kind he wants. It's all about where this character had been located. If he was in anywhere relatively good, or anywhere that opposed Iuz and his army, more than likely the kingdom of Furyondy would get word of it and send out a small retainer of paladins to deal with the necromatic issue. \n\nOf course Oerth is a HUGE place and one little necromancer could easily slip through the cracks. But if he's waltzing into Greyhawk City proper with skeletons and zombies trailing along,  he's going to get screwed. \n\nUltimately it's up to your discretion. If I were DMing a game with a player that wanted to be a necromancer, I'd be a bit more lenient on a PC than I would an NPC. If that's what they want to play, let them have their fun,.. to a point. If it's clear he's trying to abuse swarm mechanics by filling a bag of holding with a legion of skeletal rats then I'd have Pentivel come looking for him.\n\nJust FYI, Pentivel was a paladin of Pelor. You don't tend to get a lot more smitey than that. He was a sword enemy to necromancers and Orcus himself. \n\nAnd yes, that's the same Orcus. Orcus, much like the Underdark, Lloth, Tiamat, and a slew of other characters, were all Greyhawk characters that Wizards of the Coast misappropriated to Forgotten Realms when they were building their cheese-factory, drow ranger fanboi haven.
Not anywhere near as repugnant. \n\nThink of the guy on South Park sitting at the filthy desk with the carpal tunnel brace.
Wow.\n
Basically Blacks. There are a number of other races that are pretty obvious racial references too. Personally I honestly never realized it until I saw articles on it, and then it becomes obvious to the point where I wondered how I could miss it. \n\nGoogling star wars racist characters probably turns up a few lists.
lol\n\nThat's funny but not really feasible. Besides, he just would have ate it.
When I read this, my knee-jerk reaction was to pick a character from the Dungeons and Dragons Dragonlance novels, Raistlin Majere. For those familiar it seems an odd choice, but if you take the character as he was in his last appearances in the novels, he was a compassionate and reflective individual. In his youth he showed compassion to the sick and weak quite a bit, and at the end of the character development he wasn't the power hungry god killing maniac he turned into.\n\nBut I was wrong. Mr. Rogers is the best answer. [He really was wonderful.](http://imgur.com/od32ygY)
Hindsight is 20/20, as they say. At the time I was unaware just how unethical this company was. I was naive and thought that we had decent people in our middle management. Since then I've been able to see that it isn't the case, unfortunately.
As someone who's traveled a lot, I'm surprised New Orleans is this far down. Paris France, okay I understand that. Gary Indiana, I understand that too. Cincinnati Ohio, yeah it's really rough. None of these are as awful as New Orleans. 
Bernie, c'mon man..\n\nGo with the Green Party in 2020. You got my vote already buddy.
Sorry to post twice, but I wasn't sure if you'd see if I just updated my last post. The boxed set is called From the Ashes, and it contains two books, one of which was called the Atlas of the Flaness, the other is all about the Free City of Greyhawk and it's history, etc. The whole point is that Greyhawk is a sprawling metropolis, mixed with all the denizens of the world represented in some small portion. It's a neutral town, meaning your Paladin of Pelor will have to put up with Clerics of Iuz sneering at him. \n\nAnd feel free to ignore the whole Rary the Traitor storyline. Lots of campaigns that I've been in seem to, since it was all just Wizards of the Coast being dickbags to Gary Gygax and crew. 
The system wouldn't be able to suppress anyone if we, the American people, would pull our heads out of our asses and face the fact that the system can't do anything to us unless we let it. \n\nAnd I went Green too. :D Aside from Sanders, Stein was the only one in it that was worthwhile.
People were saying Trump was going to ban Muslims before the election? \n\nNope, that was post election. Huh..
My asshat boss attempted to fire me just a couple weeks ago. Before someone above him to him to go fuck off, I had about eight hours of head-spinning to get through. I wouldn't have made it. In hindsight I know that. \n\nI somehow managed to get into a one shot 5e game a couple hours after they posted they were looking to do a quick game. It took a few hours. It really made all the difference. \n\nI've played D&D since before I could read. It's been the one constant in my entire life. I should really look to see if there's any way I could work with the company professionally. I think that'd be the pinnacle of achievement for me and I'd love to give something back to the game that's made my life livable. 
Bas himself was a part of a more scientific ( using that loosely here ) study on the power of MMA fighters. They had him knee a training dummy in the chest with some compression sensors and the like.\n\nThe amount of power in his knee was enough to move the ribcage of an adult male behind the heart. Granted on a living body, this explodes the heart... 
Yeah, you're right. Bernie should stick with the second party where they intentionally manipulate and flat our rig their own elections against him.\n\nThat'll turn out much better, right? \nEdit: Forgot that the downvote is the disagree button on this sub.
Tell me again why he wasn't the better choice for president?
The Kingdoms of Iuz and anywhere ruled by the Scarlet Brotherhood would be two places necromancers would be gladly accepted, just off the top of my head. The first would be somewhere a necromancer would thrive and be highly sought after. The second would depend on his connections, I believe. The Wild Coast and Pomarj would be accepting of a sensible necromancer, but would surely move swiftly to deal with an upstart trying to amass an undead army, I'd believe. \n\nI am not an expert on Greyhawk, just to say that, but I did play in it for a long time and have done a lot of reading. A necromancer who walks into Greyhawk proper with any undead is going to end up, at best, relieved of his minions and kicked out of the city permanently I'd imagine. At worst, he'll be imprisoned. \n\nBut, as long as he doesn't have any ghoulies with him, he'll be just fine. He would probably even freely be able to talk about his craft, become a member of the mages guild, and do all the research he wanted within town limits on being a necromancer without too much of an issue. Again, best of luck and have fun!
The mixed races in the crowds, the armed guards that patrol with a wary eye, and the occasional glimpse of one of the mage protectors of the city out of the corner of your eye as they slip into a shadow and vanish. And this is just right at the main entry points into Greyhawk proper. \n\nI don't know if it was core or not, but my DM in our game that lasted about fifteen years ( best DM I've ever heard of, let alone watched or played with ) played the guards as very effective with dealing with low level adventurers. You don't cast a light spell in city limits without the mage guards knowing about it. 
This is the only advice you need.\n\nAnd as you advance your relationship, remember this advice. It  has practical applications for the both of you for building a successful love life. \n\nCommunication is key in all aspects of relationships. 
You know there is trouble brewing in our government when the homeland protectors are persecuting the protectors of our interests abroad. I guess the corporations are more worried about the domestic issues at the moment.
Indiana is the epitome of one of those midwest states that votes against its own interests. 
Be sure to add that little sniveling shill John Oliver too.
Bernie was forced to endorse the corporate puppet. \n\nHe can't lead us as he's proven corruptible already. As much as it pains me to say so, we have to accept his vision while questioning his decisions.
I'm thirty-six years old.\n\nI told my parents that I needed psychological help when I was eighteen. Unfortunately we didn't have the money for it. I know this game made you feel a lot better but depression is an enemy that won't go away. Please, do yourself and yourself in twenty years a favor and go tell your parents. \n\nYou can't get over severe depression by making friends and playing D&D. Trust me, it's saved my life more than once but eventually the chemical imbalances in your brain will wear you down. \n\nTell your parents you need help. Insist to them that you go to therapy. Don't take it for granted that you're feeling better now because, as it's been my experience, the higher up your happiness goes, the longer swing that pendulum has to swing back. \n\nPlease, please get proper help. 
You know what they say, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it think. ;)
Mmn... I've no concept of how much tofu one would eat in a sitting, or how to pair it with anything but, I've wanted to try tofu forever. \n\nAnd he ends it by talking about meal prepping with it. :D\n\nDude's the bomb. :D\n\nI wonder how tofu heats up in a microwave after it's been cooked and chilled... 
You need to react appropriately to WHY you have to avoid contact. Did you do something awkward or uncomfortable that you don't want to face? Did you say something unseemly to her? Does she act inappropriately toward you? Is she making lewd advances that you aren't interested in? Have you tried telling her that you aren't interested in her and you'd prefer to focus on the classwork? \n\nYour options are probably either to be rude to her, have a civil discussion with her, or have a talk with your teacher in private and see if they can assist.\n\nEdit: Talking with the teacher might be able to bail you out of any bad discussion and might lead to you being able to move. Ask your teacher if they will pay attention, and next time she's chatting with you in class the teacher can  yell at YOU and move you to a new chair under the pretext that you were the one at fault. This way you can pass on future conversations by being mildly upset that it happened and she won't be the wiser. Sure you might hurt her feelings a little, and I'd much rather you act like a mature person and talk to her, but this seems possibly the least amoral choice. 
I don't think you meant to say you're going to run a fifteen hour game...
Evidence of what? That NAFTA was horrible for minorities? That the TPP was against the will of the people? \n\nJesus fuck, it's just not worth it anymore. It's really not. Let the dumb be dumb. Enjoy your existence. 
I got you man. I was joking too about that whole time machine thing. Heh,.. I mean, c'mon.. ^seriously ^if ^you ^have ^one, ^hit ^me ^up.
This is why this sub rocks. :D
Every single one of them needs to be asked what they're going to do to remove the corruption from the DNC and ensure that the elections won't be tampered with in the future.
I grew up watching [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZneHuluv3gs), I think I know what you're talking about. That'd be really uncomfortable to work in though.
No, it's just the most apt one. Bigly.
No dedicated servers means lag will be a major issue, if I'm not mistaken. Plus, how can you tell how good it looks? They released a five second clip in their Pre-order trailer, nothing that shows you anything enough to get excited about. If I'm wrong, and I really hope I am because again, the ME3 multiplayer is probably my favorite thing to play ever, please show me. I'd love to be wrong here. \n\nSorry if pre-order clips don't get me hot. I'm one of those daft people that resolutely shun pre-orders, since they're a plague on the industry.
DNC doesn't care about progressive views, just trying to guilt everyone into voting for their picks through guilt and "because Trump".\n\n
I just heard a report on a morning radio talk show that Lucas recently confirmed that Jar-Jar was in fact the villain for the Phantom Menace movies but they ended up rewriting it all because he was a racist caricature that everyone hated in pre-screenings of the first in the three. \n\nIt's a damn shame, because that would have been phenomenal. They rewrote the good shit and left all the racist portrayals in it.
No lie, looking at the results from previous drawings I'd spend 100% on it on a new gaming PC setup. 
hrc and co were setting up for war in Syria, as well as being supporters of the terrorist actions of Israel. \n\nAgain, she wasn't going to usher in an age of peace. They were already gearing up for war on the premise that her cheating was going to award her with the white house.
Nothing too extreme that was caught. \n\nUnfortunately, what I didn't have any substantial proof of was his habit of rubbing his gut against people. He did it a lot and always had a perverse smile on his face. \n\nAll of this really makes me question the company, especially since they have been protected him for over twenty years. 
That's not a rebuttal. If they were wanting to put quality into it, they would have made dedicated servers. ME3 multiplayer was almost a sort of after though addition, hence why there wasn't more to it.\n\nThe fact that they know it was popular and they're not adding on more leads you to the conclusion that I already stated. They aren't putting much effort into this multiplayer and, since they're being very tight lipped about what the multiplayer WILL be, there's no reason to have much confidence in it. They're hiding instead of showcasing. \n\nBelieve what you want, but guerilla marketing rarely, if ever, is used by good products. Be sure to preorder though!
I have to defend the second movie. Spoilers below, so you know, if you haven't seen the second or third Matrix movie, stop reading. K, done. \n\nI know it gets a lot of flak, but it set up a sort of infinite regress scenario where Neo could feel the squids because they were all still in the Matrix. The third movie would have been all about how to actually get out of the matrix, and how to know that you're no longer connected to it, sort of a, "what really is reality?" question in a movie that was already questioning reality. Philosophically it probably would have been really interesting.\n\nThere's no defending the third movie. "Neo is machine Jesus. The End." \n\nHorrid writing. They literally just gave the fuck up on that one.
I agree with practically everything you said, with some minor caveats. A ranger doesn't have to be cruel, neglectful, or unkind in any way to be visited by a druid who doesn't like them throwing off the natural behavior of their companions by turning them into pets. \n\nThe second is a little bit odd to have listed following the first, but I felt it needed mentioned. I am in no way, shape, or form a fan of interparty conflict because one player wants to be a dick to the rest because it's "in character/a part of the characters nature". \n\nTo explain, I'm playing in a game right now running Out of the Abyss. My character has some madness issues, one of which being if someone disagrees with him he will get violent. Up until last weeks session, it hadn't been a major issue. It was minor things he got all pissed off over or commanding about and the party followed suit without trouble, but in that session my characters madness conflicted with another characters. \n\nAs soon as my DM looked like he was moving toward PVP, I flat out stated that I will have no part of any game with player verses player combat because I feel it goes against the spirit of the game.\n\nI think we're going to have to agree to disagree on the whole though, as I would be very worried about playing with a DM who sees characters the way that I'm perceiving you do. End of the day, all that matters is that everyone is having fun. Best of luck to you and your party. May your games always be filled with the best of times.
I understand what you're saying and the differences. \n\nI don't see it as being relevant to the conversation. In a realm where semantics are very important, you're arguing a pointless and unnecessary stance all because I said "not having a full time job says nothing about your moral character".\n\nYou see the absurdity in your argument, right? It's completely without substance, but just arguing to argue. 
HR is there to protect the company from lawsuits. End of story.
USA.
LOL eeew
Grew up next to a corn field right smack dab in the middle of nowhere to go and ain't nothin' comin'. Hoosier, born and raised. We're the epitome of a flyover state and the majority of our population is just passing through. We've got more greasy spoon diners in my town than you'd ever care to eat at and all because people need to stop to grab a bite before they get the hell out of Indiana. In all my life, I can count the number of people I've met that admitted they wanted to stay in Indiana forever on one hand. \n\n
C'mon Senator Sanders, it's well past time to pull away from the DNC. \n\nThis is beyond asinine now. 
Yes he is. It's too bad our country doesn't want integrity.
The problem is that the powder keg you mention is our home. \n\nSanders would have at least done his earnest to help the common citizens of the US. \n\nI'll take Trump over hrc any day of the week, any week of any month of any year. If she runs again I might vote for him just to stand as firmly against her as I can, but man that's a hard pill to swallow. It's worth it to get rid of the clintons, but fuck.. Why can't we have Bernie and other candidates who deserve to be there? Why do we have these people who think the Kardashians are interesting casting their votes like they're placing bets?\n\n"Bernie won't win. I won't vote for him."\n\nBITCH THIS ISN'T HORSE RACING, IT'S THE FATE OF OUR COUNTRY!\n\nCapitalism doesn't need a band-aid. It needs put down. We need to value people, their lives and well being. Not money and corporations.
It would almost certainly have to be unintentional. It's a possibility, but ignoring people is one of my pet peeves. I was about five or six when I went with my aunt to my grandfathers apartment. The old landlord cornered her and was griping up a storm, but she smiled and talked to him and was very polite. After she walked away, she was visibly frustrated and I remember telling her to just ignore him. She told me that it was rude to treat someone like that and she wouldn't behave in that manner. It's stuck with me through my life, so hopefully I'm prepped to deal with angsty time travelers. ;)
One of my professors always prefaced Kant by saying that you had to take his later works, and the latter parts of the Critique, with a grain of salt because Kant started to lose his intellectual capacity as he entered his twilight years. 
All that and not even an upvote. :(\n\nI can't help you there. I haven't much looked at rogues. \n\nAt the end of the day play what makes you happy. I'm in a game with a DM who puts in a lot of effort but shows a lot of favoritism and has some truly retarded views of the game. \n\nAs an example, Tieflings, Draconians, and several other races were banned for some vague reason of "distracts from the..." I think he said game. It was muttered and not really elaborated on. Some of which I understand. Flying elves create a headache for DMs because now you have a character that has a lot more mobility than the rest of the party. I get that. I might not particularly like it, but I definitely understand. But Tieflings? They're a fucking core PHB race now. \n\nBest of luck to you. I hope you have a great campaign, I really do. D&D should be enjoyed and at the end of the day if everyone is having fun then it's a good game.
Ties to foreign nations - See hrcs top donator Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee hrcs top private donator, also one of the top financial backers of the 9/11 attack. \n\nThis is why it's infuriating to try to educate people. Our corporate media is constantly yammering about all the awful things associated with the current moron in the oval office and refuse to acknowledge the hypocrisy that is their backing of hrc. \n\nEvery single thing the corporate media was trying to say trump would do if he became elected was nothing compared to what hrc has already done. 
Nice! Just please don't use the Rary the Traitor bullshit. It was an intentional slap in the face to the creators and developers of the game. Rary was a PC who never took a single offensive spell, in fact he never was on the Circle of Eight, never was powerful enough to cast any of the spells with his name as he didn't even make it past level three! Lord Robilar was always a good character too.\n\nResearch pause. Edit! Sorry, I posted spoilers for a seven year old module. Just the same, you are warned. End Edit.\n\nDid a little bit of digging and found that WotC at least had the decency to say that Robilar did not in fact attack the Council, but it was his twin brother pretending to be him while Robilar himself was on another plane of existence adventuring. That makes me smile a little bit. They published that as a 3.5 return to Castle Greyhawk kind of adventure. Huh.. Good for them.\n
Because I looked at who her supporters are, and who her ties are, and how she conducts herself and her history of government work. Every horrible thing they said Trump might do during the election were things that hrc had already done worse. \n\nBecause I'm a rational human being with a memory who knows how awful NAFTA ( a bill she helped create with her husband while he was President ) was for people as well as the TPP, which she helped draft a bunch of while Secretary.\n\nIt's called not having your head in the sand and/or not being a sheep. I'm sorry if that comes off insulting, it's not my intention, or jaded. 
This exactly. Are you trying to Superboy over a wall or Jackie Chan-ing it? 
Recovering Catholic. Not only did I hear, "Body of Christ" in my head when I saw these, I also muttered amen. -.-\n\n
My sentiments exactly. I don't blame the second movie, I blame the third. That's where the writers got intellectually lazy.
I was completely unaware. I guess the fall was even farther than I had known. Thanks.
Congratulations, you just summed up lesson one of modern Capitalism.\n\nAs the wholly corrupt LBJ said, "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."\n
Thank you so much! I really don't want to leave my company, as they're a five hundred billion dollar a year entity, but given the ethical climate of my immediate area, and the fact that my building is notorious for denying transfer requests, I think it might be in my best interest to get as many feelers out as possible. Much appreciated! :D
First off, I'm talking about people who play a monk from level 1 on, not people who start level 20. I don't understand that fascination or why people think balancing a D&D character at level 20 is appropriate. It's fucking retarded, but just more bad writing by WotC. \n\nOne thing that is a problem with all monk traditions is their extremely limited ki pool. It should be at least doubled at every level, if not increased more so, unless you have a DM that cut short rest down to a half hour or ten minutes, you're going to be out of ki pretty much all the time. \n\nOpen Hand- It's extremely limiting in the sense that you have to be in melee. You have to have yourself exposed. And when you're playing with the horrid point buy system that limits your stats so your max AC will be 16 unarmored, you miss out on a lot of what the class can do if you want to armor up and be able to survive past level 5. \nTheir Wis+Dex armor ability needs to be added on to using light or medium armor as well to make them viable at higher levels. \n\nWay of the Shadow- Benefits from adding a cantrip. Why is this the only monk tradition that gets a cantrip? This tradition in and of itself really doesn't add much to a monk. I'm not sure what you consider insane, but compared to other classes, monks don't have the DPS the rest of the damage builds do. Nowhere near. I'm not sure what you're playing, what other classes you're playing with, or how your DM runs, but standard by the book way of the shadow isn't going to outpace a fighter, warlock, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard for damage. You aren't going to come close if they're being played right in a proper rules game.\n\nFour Elements - Ki. You don't have anywhere near enough. I know this is the overarching problem, but it's so significant for this tradition that it has to be listed twice. \n\nWhich brings us to..\n\nSun Soul- Same thing. It needs it's ki totals at least tripled or quadrupled. It's just so ki starved that it's virtually non-playable.\n\nWhich brings us to.... \n\nLong Death - There's nothing to see here. Just move on. It's 100% garbage that should only be used by people who are playing games devoid of combat. \n\nKensei and Tranquility - Neither of these add anything beyond RP aspects to the class. Kensei is just an excuse to play weeaboo D&D. Tranquility is for people who want to play a healer that isn't one of the healers already in the game, but they're subpar healers in comparison and don't offer anything positive enough to make them a better pick than a cleric or even a druid.\n\nAll in all, Monk is a class suited much better for low combat, high RP games. They're a support class with some minor quirks, but lacking any real ( wait for it ) punch. \n\nI love playing my monk, but I've been playing dungeons and dragons for thirty years, so new stuff always piques my interests. It's just a very poorly written/designed class. It's borderline whelming / underwhelmed. 
I've already answered this clear attempt at obfuscation. \n\nMan, people are coming out of the woodwork to defend this. Kinda funny.
It's outrageous that your full credit history and score is not freely available to you in the most comprehensive and official capacity
You're free to think whatever you want, but when you crunch the numbers, they don't usually even appear on DPR charts for 5e because they're not relevant. Sorc-Lock and Totem Barbs are the high end. Monks are the low end.
If your elf ranger collects too many animal friends, are you going to send a pissed off druid to strike them down for corrupting nature? \n\nIf your fighter delights in slaughtering Goblins, is the avatar of Maglubiyet going to show up and smite them? \n\nI think a lot of DMs unfairly target evil PCs just for the alignment and not for their play. I played an evil wizard for over a decade. My party never had a clue he was evil because he wasn't an idiot and my DM never punished me for just my alignment. \n\nI'm not saying that's what you're doing but I thought it necessary to point out that you might be jumping into a bad DM habit. Let evil characters be evil, but don't just punish them for it without merit. They should still be able to play their characters as those characters are. \n\nThis is probably one of the few things that I don't agree with Gygax on. From my understanding he was very against evil PCs. I could be wrong on that. 
Direct hire/temp to perm. Does that mean you're working for a shorter period as a temp and being hired by the company sooner rather than the usual stuff you'd get through an agency?
I work for a multi-billion dollar company and was physically abused by my superior. After they went through some pretend firing of the guy, they brought him back and moved him to a different building.\n\nI was directly told that he's been moved so much over his career, never staying in any one building longer than a year or two, because he continually abuses employees. \n\nThe lack of ethics is a plague in this country, and it's coursing strongly through the corporate bodies. 
I've been wondering about this myself. Seems like the more attention Ronan gets, the more people are endorsing Ellison. It's a bit confusing.
Stay away from the justice democrats website with that opinion. They push the Russia narrative with a fervor over there.
Better than her! No question about it what so ever.
For me, on PS4, I've usually got almost 4000 people playing. I didn't see enough out of campaign mode to feel it was all that engaging. I've played multiplayer almost exclusively since like the second day of having it. I've regened my pilot once. Don't really see much of a reason to do it again.\n\nFrankly I thought they were going to have a lot more content. It's enjoyable, but playing it as a solo player, there really isn't a whole lot of longevity.
Unfortunately these arguments are going to be drummed up more and more as corporations fight having to pay taxes for automated production machines and moving the populous to a universal basic income. I've a very intelligent friend who works for a company that is in the business of automation, among other things, and even he still has a knee-jerk resistance to UBI, despite having admitted the logic behind it is sound. \n\nIt's sometimes just uncomfortable for people to accept something that they are unfamiliar with. 
I agree, and I think to do so we need to get rid of the DNC.\n\nThere's an extreme lack of ethics in this country, political, economically, and socially. 
Voter fraud is where Bob the janitor takes his dead brothers ID down to the polling station and casts a vote.\n\nElection fraud is when parties are mass tampering with votes to slant the election in a particular way.\n\nYou're not talking about voter fraud. 
That's possibly the most moronic thing I've heard all week. \n\nNot having a full time job says nothing about your moral character.
I fear it's already too late. \nNo one seems concerned about her taking foreign money for her campaign. No one seems to care that she was taking campaign donations before officially declaring she was running. \n\nLong story short,.. no one seems to care. 
OP's awesome. 
Preach!! Dodd-Frank was weak sauce and even when the banks presented their living wills, which weren't good at all, that was enough grounds to break them up, instead what did Obama do? He just told the banks to try again, I'm willing to bet my paycheck, that the banks will never produce adequate living wills, they'll just keep stalling and kicking the can down the road until the next crash, so they'll bailed out instead of breaking themselves up. I'm still waiting for the government to present the report on the bank's last attempt to craft living wills. As weak as Dodd-Frank is, even when there is a chance to enforce it, they don't because they are doing bidding of the banks. I agree, Glass-Steiegel is our only hope, also I believe the big banks need to be broken up.
Look, Tulsi isn't trying to be Assad's BFF and she isn't claiming that he is some modern day MLK. All Tulsi is asking is that our government stop sending arms and support to these rebels who are extremists themselves or they hand off the weapons to groups like ISIS and JFS(Al Qaeda). Remember the US funded Al Zinki group who beheaded that 12 year old Palestinian? Yeah, that's where your tax dollars are going to, but keep talking shit about Tulsi. Smh. She isn't swallowing the media narrative that Assad is Hitler and we need to keep helping the "moderate rebels", she is actually going on the ground talking to people, seeing everything closer you or me ever will so I think I'll listen to what she has to say. I thought progressives were supposed to be well informed. To reiterate, yes, Assad is an authoritarian but ISIS or JSF, who are strongest of the rebel groups, taking over Syria is much worse for the Syrian people and the world. 
I'd mention how the last time the US had a 90% tax rate, was during Eisenhower's presidency one of our best economic times, and I'd also mention that FDR was also a socialist.
 Well, firstly if Mass Surveillance stopped an attack the US government would parade that shit like the Bin Laden raid. It would be the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that Mass Surveillance isn't aimed against American citizens but is for our protection, that is yet to happen. Secondly, according to the government, Mass Surveillance has stopped some attacks but officials won't say when or where or who were stopped, we have to just take their word for it cause the government would never lie to us. /s   Except for that one time when the government said it wasn't spying on millions of American and it turned out that they were. Also I got into this same debate with another group of people and not a single one could produce a shred of evidence that it has stopped an attack, the closest they could get was some guy sending $500 to Al-Shabaab in Somalia. I don't know what meets your criteria for "stopping a terrorist attack" but that doesn't meet mine. Think about it, the anthrax attacks, the underwear bomber, the shoe bomber, the DC sniper, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston Marathon bombers, The Time Square Bombers, the San Bernardino shootings, the Orlando nightclub shootings, the NY/NJ 2016 bombings, the Fort Lauderdale airport attacks 2 months ago, is my point getting across about Mass Surveillance and it's failure to stop terrorism since 2002? There was a bunch of other attacks and attempts that I didn't mention, not mention the mass shootings like Aurora. You have the internet, search for a single instance that Mass Surveillance stopped an attack. Believe I wish it was for stopping terrorism but the attacks I listed and it's unceasing nature tells me otherwise.
You mean the same Intel agencies that told us that Iraq had WMD? Those ones? The same ones that said they weren't spying on millions of Americans and it turned out that was a lie. Those 17 agencies? Get your head out of your ass.
Hear! Hear! I wish I could give you a hundred up votes.
The fuck was the West thinking? There is no way in hell Russia was gonna sit and let the West install a puppet government in Ukraine and put another NATO country on it's border. NATO's whole purpose was to eventually fight Soviet Russia, after the USSR dissolved, NATO stayed so it obvious the West still planned to keep a knife in form of NATO at Russia's neck. People are pissed that Russia didn't let it happen.
I love how the people who responded to you claimed there is all sort of evidence, yet none of them have provided any evidence or links to the evidence so it can be looked at and judged.
You know, at first I thought it would be interesting to see what Cheney has to say about his past positions but then I thought about Rumsfeld's documentary, "Known Unknowns" I believe that is what it's called, could be backwards. I couldn't get past 15 minutes of hearing Rumsfeld's bullshit. McNamara at least in this film seems remorseful and he can tell that he has made some terrible decisions that helped led to the death of millions of people. Rumsfeld wasn't remorseful at all, he was still drinking the kool-aid they served during the Bush Administration and was trying to past it out.. still. I'm sure Cheney will likely be more staunch in his past positions, judging by most recent interviews. He deserves your hate, believe me he has mine and the lack of empathy he shows over the lives he has helped destroy makes me hate him more. He is a despicable human being. Just talking about Dick Cheney is pissing me off, that's how terrible this dude is.
" Russia started to flex it muscles again (in Georgia, 2008)" To be honest, a couple of days ago I couldn't tell you a thing about the Russo-Georgian 2008 war, as it seems to be named. But I decided to do a little research and the "Russia invaded Georgia" narrative fell apart pretty fast. In fact, Georgia started that war when it invaded South Ossetia, they even fired on civilians then Russia went into S.Ossetia pushed the Georgians out at the same time another Russian force smashed their military infrastructure, my guess is to prevent or to delay Georgia from making that kind of move again(Many in the West were upset by that). The Europeans even admitted that the Georgians started the war: http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article130791.ece  The report even states Over 100 US military advisers were "reportedly" in Georgia on 7 August and "an even larger number of US specialists and advisors are thought to have been active in different branches of the Georgian power structures and administration,". What are all those Americans doing in Georgian power structures  the day before Georgia launches a military attack on South Ossetia? Here's a fun fact the Prime Minister of Georgia at the time, Mikheil Saakashvili is currently wanted by Georgia on charges of embezzlement, he fled Georgia and then popped up in Ukraine, where is was the mayor of the Odessa region of Ukraine(2015-16). Ironically, he resigned due to the Western backed Kiev government being too corrupt, in his words: "This is going on quite openly. Odessa region is being handed over not only to corrupt people, but also to enemies of Ukraine,"  he said this also: “Odessa can only develop once Kiev will be freed from these bribe takers" https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/world/europe/mikheil-saakashvili-resigns-ukraine.html?_r=0       http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37895588
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7F8RfnDhkA I hope this helps.
I beg to differ, not the justify attacks on civilians part. But I voted for Obama in 08' and he took the drone program to a whole new level, along with other things. Every time I heard about a drone strike or a night raid that killed civilians, I felt partly responsible as if I pulled that trigger or pressed that button myself, as I should have. Voting for him is one of my biggest regrets, more people ought to feel responsible for the people they elect and their political actions, if they did, America and for that matter, the world wouldn't be in the position that it is now. So I don't think its out of the question to hold Trump's voters responsible for his political actions, at least Obama lied to me, Trump told them the horrible things he planned to do and they voted for him anyway. So yes, I hold them responsible for Trump just as I hold myself for Obama 08'-12'.
Very true and I believe this whole Flynn scandal and other upcoming scandals is just encouraging the Dems to not change their ways, they likely think all they have to do is wait for Trump and the GOP to fuck up so bad that the voters will have no choice but to come to the Dems so there is no need stop the gravy train and corruption. Smh.
Yeah and notice she only talked about getting rid of citizen's united, not getting money out of politics. There are at least like four or five other decisions that have to overturned to for sure get money out of politics. You're doing a lot of mental gymnastics to say "I told you so" with of all people: Hillary Clinton. And it's not working. You talk like she was going to usher in some new progressive era or out left lean Obama or some shit. She wasn't gonna get money out of politics, she wasn't break up the too big to fail banks, and she wasn't gonna break up the media(which is something that's not talked about very much) in order to stop the disaster that we're heading for. She was a very crappy candidate who ran an arrogant campaign, if she didn't have the media carry water for her she would not have made it far in this election and it was ultimately the media bubble of "Hillary is the greatest and unbeatable" that led to her arrogance, like this from the NYT: "Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was so confident in her victory that her aides popped open Champagne on the campaign plane early Tuesday" And if you can't see this after all this time, then there is nothing else for us to talk about.
The fuck are you talking about? You didn't refute what I said with any real substance. I can tell you're one of those "root for team blue, no matter what" motherfuckers. And seeing another comment you posted above confirms it, just stick your head in the sand and wish upon a star that the Dems through the kindness of their hearts will stop doing the bidding of their corporate and super rich donors. Let's hold hands and hate Trump together and the corruption in the DNC will work itself out, they promise. /s LOL.
If you think Valentine's has anything to do with love then you are lost, my friend. It's a corporate cash grab between Christmas and Easter and they convinced idiots that if your significant other didn't buy any of their product for you then they must not love you. Morons keep rushing to fill those corporate coffers. Westerners are pissed because Pakistan didn't buy the bullshit, like they did.
Truthdig.org, theintercept.com and there are of course youtube channels, like TYT politics, The Jimmy Dore show, The Tim Black Show, The Sane Progressive, Redacted Tonight with Lee Camp, Secular Talk, The Humanist report, there are others that I really don't watch but other people seem to enjoy like The Dave Pakman Show, Thom Hartmann and others.
I don't know.. Hillary did say during one of the debates that Barack Obama took more money from the financial industry than any candidate in history. Barack is pretty up there with selling out as much as Hillary, he was practically a Citigroup president. Maybe Cory is trying to outdo both of them.
Oh,oh, I see what you did there.
You mean like Judge Dredd? That's probably the best way to explain it to someone.
Oh shit, not saying I don't believe you but do you have some sources so I can read up on him?
Finally, someone who get its. If people actually did their own research, no amount of disinformation can sway you because you already have a good amount knowledge on whatever subject is being reported on. But the problem is most people are too lazy to do their own research and just take whatever is being reported as the truth because someone on TV said so or because such and such who works for a government agency said it, so it must be true. In the west, particularly in America, the big news outlets know they have lost a lot of credibility over their terrible and biased coverage during the last election cycle and are trying to sway people from the smaller new outlets who tell the truth way more often then the bigger news outlets, as you eluded to.
Actually that was never proven, word has it that it was the Turks that either gave it the rebels to use or they used it themselves to draw the US in to bomb Assad. Though that too is hard to prove, the fact that Obama still wouldn't go after Assad even after that speaks volumes, this was after Libya, so it wasn't like Obama was squeamish on intervention. Come on, Obama says the "red line" comment then coincidentally Assad decides to use chemical weapons to do what? Try to call Obama's bluff, I don't buy that for 2 seconds. Bahrain has had protest after protest against the monarchy and the protesters have been killed, beaten, jailed and tortured, why don't we start flowing weapons there? Oh, that's right because the dictators there let us station our 5th fleet in their country. As much as I wish all countries were fledging democracies, the world isn't that black and white as we hope it was and we as Americans can't even talk about democracy because our government has been co-opted by the large corporations and super rich, that drug importation bill was another shining example of that. Yet, we want to topple other people's governments.
Whatever the original ideas of most of the holidays in the west have looonnnngggg been forgotten. Its all about how much you buy and If Muslims aren't careful their holidays will be taken over too, by corporations and turned into a cash grabs. It's that simple.
I do recall during the Republican primary, Trump gave glowing reviews about the Kurds and their fighting prowess. He basically said something along the lines of "They are the only force the US can really depend on in Syria/Iraq." I'm paraphrasing, of course.
Oh, my feelings are hurt. The emails are the proof and there is the fact, Podesta, Brazile, DWS, Mook and others have never disputed or came out and said "I never sent that email" or "That's not my email." You'll of course ignore that, but you'll push that Russia lie, which no proof has ever been put forth, not even the ODNI report proved it. But since it helps you and your fellow hill bots explain away your shitty candidate, you'll peddle that garbage. Shut the fuck up, Carlos. You're embarrassing yourself. Stop writing me, there is nothing more for us to discuss.
I swear on everything I just said on reddit, someone should do this. This is fucking hilarious, this is going on my wallpaper right now.
He is right and wrong, independent media can and has been very informative. Mainstream media on the other hand, has not. The MSM is largely the reason the country is in the shape that it is in by not keeping the US citizenry informed. Instead the MSM serves only the interest of it's corporate parent owners(like the lack of TPP coverage) and carries water for the state like it did in run up to Iraq war. This same MSM showed an empty podium, waiting for Trump instead of showing Bernie Sanders speaking before thousands in Phoenix, not to mention they gave Trump $4 billion in free coverage. It shouldn't come as a shock that the public trust in the media is in the single digits. If our electorate were more informed, the majority of these politicians would not have careers, the more recent, most consequential laws and rules we have, would not exist or would be vastly different. Though philosophically and politically, me and Donald Trump couldn't be farther apart, there is truth in what he says about the media. He likely means it in the way that the media is adversarial to him, therefore it is adversarial to the American people, which I disagree with. The only way the media particularly the news media can gain back trust and become credible again is for big media to be broken up, media consolidation is the death of an informed public and democracy. Media consolidation is largely the core reason of why we're in the condition that we're in, an informed public could have prevented a lot of this. Just my two cents. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, the gift that keeps on giving, thanks Bill. /s
I just thought about this today, last year the Warriors were about "Strength in numbers", ball movement and team chemistry and the Cavs overpowered them with their stars. The Warriors blew the team up for KD along with the chemistry, its about star power for them. And now the Cavs are about team chemistry and ball movement. The irony of it is crazy.
I'm pretty new too, I'll join up with you. Oedipus_Racks is my psn username.
Oh yes, the CIA are in the top 3 most evil organizations to ever exist. When it comes to terrorism, Hezbollah are amateurs compared to the CIA.
Where was the Intel Community in the run up to the Iraq War? They could have leaked that Bush and his cohorts were lying and stopped the Iraq War, instead what did they do? They sat on their fucking hands and helped sell that lie. And now you're acting like they are some benevolent force, looking out for us. The only reason they are leaking this shit is because the Intel community doesn't want peace with Russia, it wants another cold war, it's pretty obvious. And if it's true that the IC have been withholding intel from Trump then that should scare you because it's plausible that Trump isn't the first president they have done this to. Even worse, it's also plausible that the IC have been shaping foreign policy of the US this whole time by withholding and revealing whatever intel they want.
To be honest, I was not very knowledgeable about politics at the time, which means I was very susceptible to anything, in fact Obama was my first foray into politics. I drank the kool-aid of "hope" and "change" heavily but there is a silver lining, Obama taught me my most valuable lesson about politics, 1) Always check their voting record, 2) Find out who they are taking money from. If I would have known those two things, I would have very likely made a different choice, but that was my fuck up. It brings to my mind a quote by Malcolm X, when he was talking about his days in the Nation of Islam: "I was a zombie then—​​like all [Black] Muslims—​​I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years."
http://usuncut.com/resistance/bernie-sanders-supporters-are-suing-dnc/ Oh shit, they are being sued. You were saying? Here is another gem about Tom Perez telling Podesta that their campaign should paint Bernie as the candidate for whites to turn off minorities: http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/10/11/labor-secretary-advised-clinton-cast-sanders-candidate-whites-turn-minorities  I loved how you jumped on the DNC collusion bit but totally bypassed the part about the DNC tipping the scales in Hillary's favor. Nice deflection. But.... since you focused on the DNC collusion part, what is this in my pocket? Oh, its a link about how the DNC tried to hide that the Hillary Victory Fund was really funding Hillary's campaign and not state parties as she claimed. Sounds like she broke campaign finance laws:  http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dnc-leak-clinton-team-deflected-state-cash-concerns-226191   You seem like your head is pretty deep in the sand, so I saved the best for last. Here is one about Donna Brazile leaking debate questions to Hillary's camp: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/07/donna-brazile-is-totally-not-sorry-for-leaking-cnn-debate-questions-to-hillary-clinton/?utm_term=.a460d5a4fbe2   Since you need your hand held. If I, a party official, leaked debate questions to your campaign and you use that information to whatever means, then that would set the grounds for collusion. This was from the Washington Post, a paper that endorsed Hillary. My guess is when these stories broke, you buried your head in the sand and didn't bother to find out if any of this was true, it took me five minutes to deconstruct your argument. Now since I proved I'm not ignorant or a liar, this must mean you're either a liar or you are willfully ignorant, its one thing to mislead another person, its another to mislead yourself. "She resigned for optics." that's a euphemism, if I ever heard one.
That's ironic, most of those countries we're currently bombing. I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
Exactly, as someone who is extremely left wing, I know this is false, cause he(Obama) had Lindsey Graham and John McCain, two very powerful Republicans screaming at Obama to bomb the Syrian Army. Obama's limited approach(if we want to call it that) is a result of what happened in Libya and him not really wanting to get involved in Syria in the first place, he was talked into by members of his cabinet, especially Hillary Clinton. On a side note, the only intervention that I ever heard Obama advocated for was Ukraine, that was all his idea.
Oh ok, I see what you mean.
Also the means to an end of what you're talking about is a pipeline and installation of a Sunni leader who is not friendly to Iran, they don't even care if that Sunni leader is an extremist as long as he is Sunni and does their bidding.
The fuck are you talking about? Assad is Muslim and so is most of the Syrian Army. You talk as if they(Assad and the SAA) are some other religious group going after Muslims. GTFO. Are you calling the rebel groups devout Muslims?
Very true, but being a little better than those two doesn't make him a prize. Which is what kills me about the Dems, they believe all they have to do is be a little better than their Republican opponents and that will suffice, they feel they have no need to go any further than that.
Rand Paul came out and said "That when it comes to foreign policy, John McCain has been wrong every time. He supported going into Iraq, if you look at a world map, there are at least 6 countries Senator McCain has advocated for putting American boots in those countries. He is usually complaining that we're either not in some war that we should be or that we left a conflict too fast." Hilariously spot on description of McCain, I would know, he is my state's senator. Sadly.
Erik Prince?
Warren is out of the question unless we can unseat Charlie Baker in 2018.
Bernie needs to leave this shit alone and focus on changing the corrupt Democratic party, who are trying to distract everyone with this red baiting. The Dems look a lot like the GOP during their Benghazi hearings and like the GOP have no evidence to back up their claims other than Trump's cabinet of oligarchs doing what oligarchs do, economically pillaging countries. They can economically pillage The US, Latin America, South America, Africa, the Middle East, China, SE Asia and even Europe but if you take your oligarchic practices to Russia then it means you must be a turncoat and a right hand of Putin. /s. Smh. Unless some hard evidence surfaces validating all this Russia hysteria, Bernie should just stay away from this as far as possible cause he is playing right into the corporate Dems and MIC's hand. The Dems have been pushing this shit since the convention, to cover up why they lost and to keep the gravy train of donor money coming into the party so they won't have to make any real change. The military industrial complex is already looking to the newest "threat" to justify our over-bloated military budget, the standing army we have had since WW2 and our 800 bases around the world. ISIS has lost half of Mosul and Al-Bab, Raqqa is surrounded, the SAA is moving on Palmyra again. The curtains are starting to close on ISIS, time to look for a new threat to keep the tax payer funded gravy train going. In the words of William Blum: "Do you know what one year of the US military budget is equal to? One year. It's equal to more than $20,000 per hour for every hour since Jesus Christ was born."
I supported him from the start of the primary because I knew him from Brunch with Bernie, on Thom Hartmann's show. I thought he was just gonna try to bring some more attention to his ideas, run out of campaign money quickly (cause elections are expensive) then drop out after a couple of months. Boy, was I wrong.
You mean all the Intel agencies who haven't shown any real evidence? Oh they said they have hard evidence but they can't show us, we just have to take their word for it. smh. Deflection is a western tactic.
Who? You mean like CNN? Or MSNBC? The question shouldn't be is Sputnik, Russian state media. The question should be is it telling the truth and in this case, it is. Unfortunately with the sorry state of our corporate media who a lot of times doesn't want to tell us the truth especially in regards to our foreign policy, one has to look to other places that speak on it. If you think this is bad, just google, United States and death squads, you'll see state sponsored terrorism on a whole different level.
Look up Dora Farms at the beginning of the Iraq War. Even American precision bombs miss every now and then. I agree, they are more accurate than the Russian ones but they are far from flawless. This is off the top of my head too, when you said this: "They hit the target every single time." I immediately thought of Dora Farms.
I'm from Arizona. He never gets a real challenger, AZ is a light red state. And the GOP never challenges McCain in AZ, that likely is the only way to get him out until AZ turns purple. Plus he's a vet and a lot like Florida, we have a huge retirement community and retired vets, they vote in large numbers and they like McCain. Also he just won re-election in AZ, during the election he wouldn't dare say anything negative about Trump cause he was afraid of Trump voters in AZ, that should show how spineless and calculated McCain is. We'll see if they remember next election.
See that's where you're wrong. The things you mentioned like holding hands or cooking a meal, it shouldn't take a holiday to come around for people to do shit like that. That's everyday shit and likely it takes a little creativity to keep pulling that off in different ways. A lot of people have been convinced that amount spent on them during Valentine's equals to how much that person loves them, unless your partner is understanding, frugal or both then your partner is likely to feel slighted because corporations have high jacked it or they are likely the inventors of said holiday. Look at Christmas, its more about what gifts you gave, how nice is your tree, and my favorite: Secret Santa, /s. I hardly hear anything about Christ, who the holiday is supposed to originally commemorate, I don't know anyone who went to a place of worship or has gone to one during Christmas and I come from a conservative background and culture. Now, I know there are people who partake in these holidays in the spirit of the original concept of them but those people are few and far between, most are hung up on the material parts. I can go on and on about the crappy holidays that we have here in the west, particularly in the US. Mark my words, Black Friday will eventually become a holiday. I can guarantee that the corporations will push harder for that they did for Martin Luther King Day, not because of racism but because they haven't figured out how to make money off of it yet.
And yet you believe it was the Russians who feed it to his source because you "think" so? My God, the internet never fails to amaze me. You know the CIA said there was WMD in Iraq and they didn't "think" about it, George Tenet(CIA Director at the time)said it was a "slam dunk" that WMD was in Iraq. So much for the CIA's credibility, now its plausible that the Russians fed it to his source but neither you or I nor anyone else has any proof, you know that stuff you need to prove something happened or is happening. Lack of proof doesn't mean you make up your own narrative, its alright to say you don't know what happened because you have no proof.
I actually with agree you on this part. This would squash all of the she is getting the "Assad approved" tour. But I sure as hell wouldn't go anywhere controlled by the rebels, those jihadists would love to get their hands on an American politician, a female and she fought in Iraq. Shit, I wouldn't take that risk. Maybe visit some refugees in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan as well and the Kurds in Syria. But she need doesn't take that tour to establish that Assad is an authoritarian ruler, she has stated that he was one, its doesn't change the situation on the ground. If Assad falls then JSF and ISIS will become the most powerful entities in Syria and will likely take over the country. The west and gulf allies exasperated the situation for their own motives and continue to do so by funding and arming these jihadist groups. Go read about what is happening in Idlib right now, JFS(Al Qaeda) are swallowing up all the other rebel groups, soon its just gonna be JSF and ISIS only. I don't know about you, but I would rather live under Assad than those head choppers.
The fuck are you talking about? The sites I sent you, you know, the ones that you didn't bother reading has links to the emails from WikiLeaks and quotes from the emails, which none of the people involved has ever disputed their authenticity. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/  https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/ Either read the emails and the links I sent you eariler or shut up. Otherwise, as I have stated twice, stop writing me cause there is nothing more for us to discuss.
Fuck no, he is grade A war criminal, he was a Citigroup stand-in. Wall Street suck-up. He had a couple of bright moments but it was outdone by his many terrible moments. I, 100% regret voting for him in 2008, what a let-down.
Yes, he should bow down and accept the government and MSM narrative. How dare he question the powerful and the media, its not like have lied or covered up anything. Those two institutions(US gov & MSM) are beacons of truth, they have never lied, does Greenwald not knows? Yes, I'm being sarcastic, if you don't know.
I agree, this has been an interesting read between us, I also thank you for your replies. South Ossetia broke away from Georgia long before the war, as matter of fact they broke away while they and Georgia were still part of the USSR. So far I haven't found anything on what was the USSR's official view of S.Ossetia's break from Georgia. Apparently, the USSR tried to stayed out of it even after war broke out in the early 90's between the two. " any normal country would have used diplomatic pressure and get their own citizens out of the area." So you're suggesting that Russia should have evacuated most if not all of South Ossetia? Also, one could argue that Russia was being just as diplomatic as Georgia. I read the OSEC report, most of the European's criticism of Russia's conduct was about them destroying Georgia's military capabilities. "Georgia 'attacked' a part of it's own country (which does of course had a lot of Russian inhabitants). " Call it what you want, it doesn't change the fact that Georgia started the war. Another thing is, if so many Americans were embedded with the Georgians, why didn't the Americans warn anyone? Or why didn't the Americans try to convince the Georgians to use diplomacy, as you suggested that Russia should have done? Due to the inactions of the Americans to do either of those things, it leaves one possibility: The Americans supported and likely encouraged the Georgians to attack/invade S.Ossetia. One side note, I ran across an interview of Putin, where he was asked where was he when the war started. He said he was in China, he said turned to western media outlets and said none of them were reporting Georgia's attack/invasion on S.Ossetia, he said "It was like nothing was going on.." Imagine someone who lives in a western country, all the sudden you see reports of Russia attacking Georgia, but just the day before Georgia went as you said "gun blazing" into South Ossetia but that was not reported or under reported so it's not a shock that the "Russia initiated the Georgian war" narrative is still alive and well. NATO's only mission is to threaten Russia and spread western hegemony, look at the NATO countries conduct in the Middle East, that will give you an idea of NATO's mindset. Montenegro's claim of the assassination plot or the WikiLeaks of DNC emails, there is not any credible proof or evidence beyond anonymous sources and claims of proof, which is never shown. The ODNI report was a joke, then US government said "We have hard proof but we can never show you, just trust us." What kind of shit is that? Even that dossier about the Russian oil company story, which I believed. Come to find out the FBI has been investigating it for months and they still haven't found anything. It's crazy how any kind of report, claim or article (past and present) about Russia is automatically swallowed up without any critical thinking, push back or research from anyone. I thought Iraq would have thought us a lesson about excepting claims regarding other countries and their conduct from our governments without questioning them. I have to go to work soon, but I'll respond to the Ukraine part, when I come back. Thanks for the discussion though, I'm enjoying it.
Ok, firstly Obama didn't need to congressional authority to bomb Syria. A US president hasn't gone to congress for war authorization since like WW2, all the sudden he goes to congress for permission, he didn't asked their permission for Libya. It was a cop out by Obama, he didn't want to go into Syria but he was backed into a corner over his red line comment. He knew the American people had no appetite for another big war and he knew that Republicans knew this too, so he handed it off to the Republicans in congress knowing they would likely say no and if they said yes, he can drag them down with him if Syria got ugly for the US. Also, I don't believe Assad did that gas attack and a few things led me to this conclusion. Obama says the red line comment then a few weeks later Assad use sarin, for what? To call Obama's bluff? Also military wise, gas isn't very effective anyway. Also Obama's apprehension was telling, here he had all the "rationale" to start bombing Syria but he doesn't take it. Why? Rumor has it, that the CIA told Obama that it was the Turks either did the gas attack themselves or they gave the gas to the rebels to draw the US into the Syrian conflict. Who's knows. But Obama's refusal to go into Syria after the "redline" is telling to me and Obama isn't scare to kill or intervene as he has shown. Assad handing the WMD over was smart for both parties, Obama can save face and Assad can rid of the WMD, so any future gas attack can't be blamed on him and used for some other power to go into Syria. Lastly your comment on Ukraine: "Well, the U.S. scarcely intervened in the Ukraine at all." That's false. Here listen to this and tell me how the US scarcely intervened in Ukraine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9J6sxCs5k
Yeah, I remember when she was polled against all the republicans, Kasich was the only one she couldn't get ahead of. When Bernie polled against them, he beat them all by a mile, only Kasich got close to him, like 3 points or some shit. If I voted republican, Kasich or Rand Paul would have been my choices. I read an article recently about that 19% of Rosneft being sold off to some unknown buyer and something about how a while ago Putin had offered to sell 19% of the company to Trump for lifting of sanctions and trade deals(which I think is what you're referring to.), very suspicious indeed. Oh yeah, the media was kissing Clinton's ass hard, they slandered other candidates or gave them very little coverage. Where they fucked up is that they made it too obvious, which I think made some people reject her even more.
Yes, they are fighting but they are fucked. Key word "Pocket" as in surrounded holding a small swath of land. Are you suggesting that those pockets can turn the tide of the war, at least in the south? Cause if you think they can then you aren't paying attention. The SAA is already assaulting East Ghouta, they'll last a few months at the most. Yarmouk/Beit Saham is ISIS, so its out of the question to arm them. Once those two go, the smaller pockets will give up without a fight. The southern pockets fates are sealed, so there goes your bright idea of arming and funding those groups.
I remember hearing about him when he played at St. Mary's in high school. Years later started to hear about another kid at St. Mary's named Jerryd Bayless, wonder whatever happened to him? /s
But who do you replace Assad with? An American puppet government? a UK puppet government? The so called "moderate rebels" who haven't existed for years? They held election a couple of years ago and Assad won like 70 something percent of the vote, so who the hell is the US government to say that he has to go? Especially when the West have no replacement in mind, not to mention they are the ones along with the gulf countries like Qatar and KSA who helped start this conflict and have the nerve to try call some shots.
Yeah, I was toiling over that word "intervention" because when one says that word, you think of tanks, planes and boots. A physical intervention, I guess coup would be a better word. My guess is that knew if he sent weapons to Ukraine that there would be a possibility that they could be used against Russian troops. Listen to this and tell me that US had little to do with what happened in Ukraine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9J6sxCs5k
I don't think it's suspicious at all. Everyone knew she was on her way out, She knew she wasn't gonna enforce the ban, Trump knew she wasn't gonna enforce it either. Hell, even if Obama handed down those orders I would hope that she would have done the same thing. It was pretty much a throwaway fire, Trump likes firing people and she didn't follow his orders, which makes him look weak(which he hates) so he gets to look powerful and send a message to the rest of the government, particularly any Obama leftovers "if you don't do what I say for the reminder of time that you're here, I'll fire you.". I wouldn't doubt that he called her and told she was fired, like it was his old show.
Mines would have to be seeing Bill Clinton shaking the hand of what I would say, was an albino alien or sightings of Batboy. Can't remember what the headline said, forgive the 90's were a while ago.
I think he could do more good as Illinois governor. Get rid of Rauner
You couldn't be more wrong. The left doesn't control the MSM, the corporations control it. You sound like a goof, spilling that "its liberal media" garbage. The MSM will favor whoever is willing to do their corporate master's bidding and they will highlight only what their corporate master's approve of. Those corporations don't care about left or right, they only care about profits. If the media was controlled by the left they wouldn't even give any republican or Donald Trump ANY air time. What did the head of CBS say about giving Donald so much air time? "It may not be good for America but its damn good for CBS" And the media favoritism of Hillary was because she was a centrist who was willing to do their bidding. Any real lefty would have never give those corporations the time or day and just incase you haven't noticed the GOP does the corporations bidding as well just like Hillary and the corporate Dems. I'm convinced that Hillary would have put a Goldman Sachs stooge as head of treasury, just like her husband, just like Bush Jr., just like Obama and look.. the Donald appointed a Goldman Sachs stooge as is tradition so don't think he is not doing the corporations bidding as well. Righties are missing the forest for the trees, real lefties see their enemy in the oligarchs and corporations who control our politicians(right and left) but right wingers fail to see this, maybe they refuse to or maybe they don't know. Immigrants can't affect you the way Citigroup can, immigrants can't affect you the Exxon Mobile can, immigrants can't affect you the way Viacom can. You righties, need to wake the fuck up. You have been had, you have been took, You have been hoodwinked. Wake up.
Fucccckkkk them. If they don't like it, they got two choices either get more informed than me about the topic or kick fucking rocks. This is one thing that kills me about this sub, these are the same people who say they are more informed than Clinton people(which is true), who argue about how the HRC, the DNC also the MEDIA colluded, lied and spread misinformation about Bernie(which is true), some even say that the DNC and media are propagating that Russia gave WikiLeaks the emails, and that no real evidence has ever been released so that the Dems can shift blame and the media can save face(which is also true.). Then they will turn around and whole heartily swallow anything the media and government says about our conduct and the conduct of other countries and their leaders. Because if you question it or say otherwise, you must be a turncoat. I get on this sub and start to think I am around others who are, maybe not totally liked minded to me but at least critical thinkers, then a post like this happens and I start to think otherwise. Its mostly that they are afraid of being seen as unpatriotic if they are critical of our foreign policy especially one that is as complex and hard to follow as Syria, so they just go along. I understand the MSM's narrative on Syria can be pretty convincing, but just a little studying on the topic their narrative falls apart pretty fast. Staying silent as your government slips to the dark side is the most unpatriotic thing you can do. Sorry for the novel. :)
Break them up, then we can let the ones that need to "die", to "die", isn't that the point of capitalism? Them being this big means they will keep taking risk because we can't let them fall also separate commercial banking from investment banking, if they want to gamble, let them gamble with their own money.
According to Woodward, Tenet reassured the president that "it's a slam dunk case" that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn his CBS interview, Woodward said he "asked the president about this, and he said it was very important to have the CIA director, 'slam-dunk' is as I interpreted it, a sure thing, guaranteed." You were saying? Here's the link:\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/18/woodward.book/  From CNN even, they had no problem lying for Bush during the run up to the war. Did Cheney try to pressure them to lie? Yes. Whether it was because of Cheney is irrelevant because the CIA went along with the lie and professed it as the truth. Hell, Tenet even sat behind Powell when he showed off the yellow cake to the UN to show the CIA backed the lie 100%. Also to paint anyone that questions the government or doesn't out of hand accept whatever the intelligence community says without proof as Russian puppets doesn't help your case at all. Matter of fact, you sound a lot like those who accused anyone who questioned Bush after 9/11 as terrorist sympathizers. One more note, a lot of those intel agencies you so whole heartedly believe have been caught peddling lies, for example, the NSA, who told us time and time again that they weren't spying on Americans. James Clapper, who was the NSA director, now head of the DNI went in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, lied to their faces about domestic surveillance.. on camera. Keep believing everything they say without proof if helps you sleep better. You have Stockholm Syndrome, my friend, get away from your captors.
I'll bite and assume you're telling the truth. So they chanted death to Americans as you say because Bernie told them to and he speaks/understands fluent Spanish right? And if you knew our history in South America and Latin America particularly the violent coups, military juntas and death squads we supported, if I was South American, I would probably hold a bitter grudge against the US government too. Last I check, Hillary's time as Sec of State, her decisions and avocation of multiple inventions(Syria in particular) led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people around the world.. just so we're clear about who has dirt.
What I would love is to not have to worry that two nuclear powers are going to go to war because one of them want to remain the sole superpower and dominate the world in every corner, I'm talking the west, particularly the US. The US has over 800 bases around the world and there are only 200 something countries. Maybe all those Eastern European countries joining NATO is scaring the shit out of Russia, ever think that? Since NATO's whole existence has been to go war with Russia since the 40's. How many countries has Russia invaded or help overthrow in the last 30 or 40 years? Whatever it is, it's breadcrumbs compare to the number that we(The US) have invaded and overthrown. And then we turn around and claim that they(Russia) are the threat to the world's peace and stability. The US lied to everyone to get into a war with Iraq, we and our European allies turned Libya in a hell hole. We're trying to do the same in Syria, which is largely the reason for the migration crisis Europe is experiening but yeah Russia is the problem. GTFOOH
Should be preaching love not hate
There's a nice little sidewalk path called Cooper Trail, I think, in the Windsor/Sherman/Locust area. Not fancy, but clean and easy to walk. Some very small wooded areas to explore, too.
Yes, ignore the massive character flaws of the candidate your party put forth. What they thought was his(Trump) flaws were deeper than Clinton's flaw, So the DNC and the Clinton camp thought they don't really have to promise to do anything concrete because people would never vote for the t.v. show host over her, Hillary Clinton. The media carried water for her, painted her in every positive light they could. They tore at the Donald after they propped him during the primary for ratings at the encouragement of the Clinton camp because they thought he would easier to beat. Now they're blaming Russia because they sense that the American people(right and left) are sick of the business as usual, politicians and the government doing the bidding of the rich and powerful. "Quick, quick.. give them something to focus their ire on. Hey, lets dust off this old trick, Russia, Russia, it was them!" Democrats are determined to lose again, I see. Glad, I left that sorry ass party last year.
Thanks, damn well I'm not shocked. If anything at least he will have his uses in that he will bring up topics that the other candidates won't go near.
Rest in peace, Tupac...
I have motion blur set to off in my settings and every time when I get on, I have to turn motion blur on, apply and save & exit, pause, turn motion blur back off again, apply, save & exit. I hope they have a patch for this coming up, cause having to do that same song and dance every time I join, is tedious.
You're deflecting, why did DWS resign? To feed poor children in Calcutta? Or because the DNC under her leadership were tipping the scales in Clinton's favor? http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/damaging-emails-dnc-wikileaks-dump/story?id=40852448  I don't even need to bring up the media collusion with the Hillary camp/DNC. Did you ignore that too? Cause I can give you links.
I don't know anything about that, but I see your username, so I'll take your word for it. LOL.
Couldn't have said this any better. Every time I see Donald, I think about the "piped piper strategy" and the rigged primary. Hillary and the DNC knew the climate of the country called for a drastically different candidate like Bernie, but instead her blind ambition was put before the good of the country. Now we have to show them what real progressivism is, either they join us or get the fuck out of the way.
Lol, I remember watching wrestling years ago and this wrestler who's gimmick was he was a porn star, his name was Val Venus. I remember the film he was supposedly "making" was called "Saving Ryan's Privates". I love when pornos sexualizes pop culture titles, "Metal Rear Solid" that is too hilarious..
Wow, you shot down everything I said out of hand, didn't even read anything. OK, I see I'm dealing with a VERY staunch Hillary believer, you just basically covered ears and shut your eyes and said "Lalalalalalalala", you are probably the most deluded Hillary supporter I ever seen, that's saying something. Talk about lack of critical thinking. You know what, there is no need for this discussion to go any further. Good luck with life.
Uhhhh... someone beat me to it. https://i.reddituploads.com/6fd27f38fbb540afa64b8a9bb9a46d73?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=9d196db91af4af29a069dc3a97ed7da5
Well let's see, Ukraine is set by a coup started by the West. Who wants Ukraine to unofficially/officially join NATO through that economic deal which is what this is all about. Yeah, I don't see Russia having a problem with a group who's whole existence is to go to war with Russia being on Russia's border. /s  Would you allow someone who is openly hostile to your existence forcefully expel your neighbor and move right next door to you? I know wouldn't. Hell, I wouldn't even let them move in.
I don't know man, Underground 2 was sick but it had a lot of comp, Most Wanted and Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition were up there. In Underground 2 though, I had a black Celica with red door mirrors, red brakes and red under glow, I nicknamed it "The Red Baron".
If you know anyone who works for a government agency, ask them to keep a private server at home and for them do all of their government work on said server, watch the reaction you'll get from them. I asked my mom who works for DES, if she did that, what would happen to her? She quickly said "I would go to jail." What you guys seem to ignore is that people that high up the "food chain" don't go to jail. There are war criminals from the previous administrations who walk around freely like they did nothing wrong or the bankers who committed mass fraud and crashed the economy, none of the top people went to jail, they weren't even investigated. James Clapper committed perjury in front of the entire country, when he lied about Domestic Surveillance, what happened to him? Oh he got promoted. The laws of this country don't apply to the elites and their cohorts in the government, its only applies to us, small fries. The fact that Clinton got away with something that me or you would be jailed for, isn't a example of her innocence but an example of the double standard that we have allowed to take hold.
Can we post bounties? I don't need to at the moment but I thought about that the other day. I may need someone rubbed out in the future who is lets say at a way higher level than me.
I disagree, because all we end up doing is let Trump solidify control over the country.  If anything we should push DemEnter even more strongly, because even if Perez wins, he'll have no choice but to play ball if he is surrounded by progressives running all the state parties
I do have experience as a deputy field organizer from the 2012 elections
Don't forget that the Tea Party took over the Republican party after Bush Jr.'s failure, we can do the same to the Dems
You are a better person than me then, I do respect your desire to hear them out and see what is their perspective on the decisions they made. The only thing I disagree with you on is whether they made decisions or not, they did, I'm not sure how learned you are on the run up to the Iraq War and the conduct of these men during it, its been well documented. Which pisses me off more because these two act like no one was paying attention or like no one knows what part they played in the war. Cheney and Rumsfeld were the main pushers of the WMD accusation on which was the basis for the invasion and occupation of Iraq was built on, which turned to be a lie, at least they named it Operation Iraqi Freedom to make everyone feel better.(sorry, now I'm being a smart ass.) Not mention Rumsfeld's avocation for torture among US armed forces and the CIA, which that also is a war crime, of course like "Iraq Freedom", they named it "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques", politicians love euphemisms. My hate for those two is well earned, as for McNamara, he was a cog in the machine not a decision maker during WW2, he couldn't influence the bombing of Japan either way, Lemay could. Even though by all accounts he didn't care for civilian lives, even Lemay as McNamara stated knew what they were doing could be constituted as war crimes. Now Vietnam is where McNamara's feet could be held to fire, you could tell he was dreading when they would bring up Vietnam, which was the main reason I watched it but the rest of it like his first memory of people celebrating the end of WW1 was some fascinating stuff. Good film regardless.
Part 2, Ukraine. Ukraine from what I understand is heavily, trade and energy wise dependent on Russia and has been for a long time. You make it sound like all Ukrainians wanted that economic deal with the West and that wasn't the case. Another thing is in the trade deal with the EU/US deal, there is a clause in it where it states that Ukraine would be seen and treated like a NATO ally even if it doesn't ever officially join NATO, that likely was very alarming to the Russians. The Ukrainian PM at the time didn't go with the EU deal, so then it turned to a coup, supported by the geniuses in the West. You have heard the recorded phone call between Assistant Sec. of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador to Ukraine, where they were deciding who they wanted to install in the new Ukrainian government? And they were installed. The Western media only reported on the part of the conversation where Nuland says "Fuck the EU." If I recall correctly she had to apologize... for saying "Fuck the EU" not for helping plot a coup in another country. Here's the audio, hear it for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9J6sxCs5k  Its been well known that western powers have wanted Ukraine in it's orbit for a while. Ukraine shares a huge border with Russia and had a decent size army before the war. NATO's march eastward since the 90's display how Ukraine would be a natural choice to flip into NATO's orbit or sphere of influence as they like to call it. "However if they join the NATO they are more or less doing what the US and the EU want them to do, but that is their choice to make." But taking part in a coup, NATO didn't give Ukraine a choice. They made the choice for them. Hell, I told you earlier a former Prime Minister of Georgia who fled his country to avoid charges became Governor of a region in Ukraine. A country that he is not even from and didn't live in until 2014. That doesn't strike you in the least bit suspicious about the Kiev government? He resigned cause he said they were too corrupt, the guy who is wanted for embezzlement! Please don't mistake those dudes in the Ukraine government as some sort of "good guys". They are not.
These are people who reconciled with the Syrian government and aren't fighting anymore, where are the "moderate rebels" that I assume that you think we should keep supporting with arms and funds? Name these groups so they can be researched. And as far as the southern rebels, lets say for your argument they are moderate, the war is lost for them, they should reconcile with the Government. It is foolish to keep funding them, plus they don't have enough men to turn the tide of war so what is the point? All the funds and arms in the world ain't gonna bring them victory. Now if they were larger than I could kind of see your point. We're just prolonging the war at this point. I will be signing this.
I made a thatch house recently I plan to only put a bed, stove maybe mortar and pastle in it. I put a small crate hidden in the woods nearby with anything I consider valuable or hard to get in it, so if my house gets raided there is nothing of real value and if they destroy it, it can be easily replaced and on my character I only carry the basic stuff when I'm logging off, again things I can easily replace. Hiding my crate away from my house is best idea I have had so far.
"Assad isn't Hitler, but his ticket to hell is only a few rows behind him." Not even close, let's see.. one helped start the largest and most destructive war in human history, tried to wipe out an entire ethnic group along with others via death camps and gas chambers and the other has imprisoned, tortured, and killed political dissidents, though both are terrible, one is a whole worse than the other. On the dictator scale, Assad is on freshmen team, He is not Hitler or Stalin, he is not Pol Pot or Suharto, he isn't even Saddam Hussein. I would put him around the Hosni Mubarak level, unfortunately for Assad since he isn't a western-backed authoritarian, he doesn't enjoy the more fluffy public image (at least in the west) that Mubarak does. Instead he is painted as the devil's right hand man. The "moderate rebels" are so few and inept that they might as well not exist. No, most either left the fight or joined with jihadist groups like ISIS and JFS. The White Helmets are a jihadists propaganda group, many of them have been spotted in other videos firing weapons, posing with dead Syrian soldiers etc. You do know this right? Look, notice in every video the people they are "rescuing" place all blame on the SAA and Assad. With all the fighting going why hardly no scene they respond to is one where the rebels blew something up? This is every video! Those videos are staged, there are videos where its the same victim(actor) from another video. You never noticed this? When the rebels lost East Aleppo, instead of staying in Aleppo where their skills would still be needed, where did the white helmets go? They went with their fellow jihadists to Idlib. As we speak the JFS(Al Qaeda) are smashing and absorbing most of the other rebel groups who aren't direct allies, in Idlib(the largest enclave of rebels besides ISIS). So after that, no one can ever claim that there are any "moderate rebels". "Many Syrians wanted Assad gone." Yes but not most of the country, otherwise he would have been gone. A few of the protesters wanted a new leader, most just wanted reform, sadly the gulf states and the west used the protest to fans the flames for a coup that turned in all out war, over a pipeline. "Our window for helpful assistance was very early in the game" We did give "assistance", we flooded the place with weapons and we paid off and armed any who would fight, they turned out to be jihadists, again over a pipeline. "they have a warm water naval port friendly to them" Assad got desperate, its permanent and free to the Russians. Russia is never going to give up that warm water port. That's a dream come for them. I thought my government learned it's lesson after Iraq about toppling governments in the middle east, I hope after Libya and Syria, we FINALLY learn our lesson.
I agree with you that Ukraine has had a culture of corruption for many years now and the new government is corrupt just like the last one was. But the truth is that the Kiev government knows that EU/US threats of stopping loans to them if they don't get their corruption under control, is just that... only threats. They know that the EU/US care more about keeping Ukraine in it's orbit than it cares about Ukraine's ridding itself of the corruption and serving the interest of it's people. Russia likely had the same attitude with Ukraine. "the EU is not a holy institution but in comparison to Russia the EU went for a democratic change of government instead of using force like Russia."  Supporting and helping plot a coup to expel the former government is not a "Democratic change of government" not matter how you slice it. Beating someone in an election is democratic change, which is not what happened in Ukraine. When a new government is installed, instead of winning in democratic elections then there is no way anyone can claim a "majority of people" support it, when they were never given a chance to choose. Honestly, it doesn't matter what you or I think, because it the people who live there, The Ukrainians who have to live with the consequences of others. Hopefully, they'll get to the point where they don't have to have their lives and country being played with like a chess game between two sides.
If I didn't work today, I would have went to watch them beat up on my Suns. Last time I saw Bron play here was during his first run in Cleveland, he had like 30 something points but Nash and the boys won the game, got to leave early to beat traffic. Good times, got to see my favorite player against my favorite team.
They were probably thinking airstrikes like in Libya, but the populaces of those countries particularly in the US were/are weary of war and a big air campaign larger than Libya was would definitely be a huge turn off for the citizenry. That's why the Brits wouldn't give Cameron the go ahead. Hell, Obama passed the buck to Republicans, who can't wait for the next war and even they didn't want another conflict on the US's hands. I guess we can boil it down to timing, had the conflict started before Libya or maybe a few years after Libya then they probably would have gotten that air support, Also, IS wouldn't have had the Syrian conflict to regroup and refit, they would have been stuck in Iraq where things weren't going well for them. At least in my opinion.
According to Woodward, Bush, himself told him this. He also said Bush didn't even consult Cheney, Powell or Rumsfeld when he made his final decision, only Tenet. My guess is Bush thought that if anyone knew for sure it was the CIA, he probably didn't know about Cheney visits to the CIA. I saw an interview recently someone stated that the CIA doesn't do things on its own(assassinations, coups, espionage etc, etc), that they take their orders directly from the Executive Branch, they'll do whatever the White House says. Apparently they'll even lie for the White House, if ordered to. Though I will say this for Tenet, he didn't want to cave to Cheney's pressure because he knew that the CIA already had a crappy reputation, they are known for doing a lot of shitty things but at least telling crazy ass lies wasn't one of them. Iraq/WMD blew that up, along with the last strains of credibility the CIA had left and now the CIA has no ground to stand on. The CIA needs to be abolished immediately and replaced in my opinion but that's another conversation altogether.
"that there's no point to repealing Citizens United?" I never said that. What I'm saying as far as Hillary goes is that getting rid of CU was just scratching the surface and that is all that Hillary was going to do as far as money out of politics. Full stop. Just in case you didn't know, money in politics has been a problem way before CU. Corporate bought politicians leads to distrust of said politicians and the system itself. Does Corey Booker who takes all that money from Big Pharma then votes in line with their interest come as a shock? Or Obama taking all that money from Citigroup then he chooses something like 93% of the people, Citigroup told him to pick for his cabinet? I can go on and on with these kinds of examples, Bernie Sanders showed that if you serve the voters, they'll financially back you and he did it with the deck stacked against him. Also Hillary spent more money than anyone in this election and she still lost. There, I just showed you two examples of how you don't need corporate money to compete and taking all the corporate money in the world doesn't guarantee a win, it's actually a liability. Don't you see that?\n
Wow, what a great argument. You should be a scholar. /s
Well what people don't know is that there other laws along with mass surveillance of citizens. For example, the NDAA, which there are sentences that state that under the AUMF, the military/government has the right to detain any US citizen who is considered a "terrorist" indefinitely, without trial. And there is one thing I have learned when reading about The US government is that they manipulate the English language like a motherfucker. Like the word "Imminent", a google search at 2 least sites say "about to happen" "close at hand", according to the US government their definition of "Imminent" can be any length of time, in their view the word is subjective. Smh. I'm eluding to Eric Holder's White Paper: https://www.aclu.org/blog/justice-departments-white-paper-targeted-killing   The way they play with words is crazy. The point is all these things coupled with Mass Surveillance enhances these horrifying laws and their effectiveness. The lack of oversight makes it prone to abuse and the killing apparatus of the US military against US citizens is something I don't think Americans would like to see abused, I know I don't. Here's the cherry on top, Stopping terrorism is the justification for Mass Surveillance's existence and it hasn't stopped a single terrorist since it's origins in 2002, Not one. So it's begs the question: Who is Mass Surveillance's real target?
Because that "old white male" has done a lot more for women then the woman actually running for president
Honestly even though I dislike Hilary, i'm willing to hold my nose and vote for her over any of the Republican clown car. 
so then lets make sure the electors aren't so establishment next time.  We already took over the democratic parties in CA, MI and NC.  I'm sure Perez would listen if his job is on the line
The main thing Bernie is pushing for is closing the gun show loophole.  Where people can sell guns at conventions without background checks, and for tighter checks when it comes to buying guns online
Not sure, i just posed a little P.S. message at the end of the message.\n\nP.S. I apologize if you have been reached already, i'm sure you can understand the importance of turnout in this upcoming primary/caucus
Welcome to the movement!
FDR no question
No one is perfect, but his message is on point with Bernie, and the establishment might be realizing that their methods aren't working, we just need to shape things from the ground up to help him stay the course
Hell i'd vote for a blind monkey with down syndrome over Trump or the rest of the GOP clown car
good luck!
Take over, its not even a question, the Tea Party succeeded with corporate help and lies, why can't we do the same with the truth and a mandate?  We need a unified front to stop Trump at all costs.  Hilary won with the deck stacked against Bernie, but he did keep it close with the current party infrastructure, and after the election berniecrats have won seats in several elections (some even unseating blue dog democrats), plus they also took over the democratic party of California, took control of the leadership of the democratic party of Michigan and gained some leadership roles in North Carolina's democratic party as well.  We are already making several inroads which could open up more doors if we keep pressing.
There will be a rally in Austin 2/27 at 9AM\nand there will be one in Dallas at 12:15PM

Here's a list of potentials according to Wikipedia, feel free to sort through them...\n\nDaniel Biss, State Senator\n\nCheri Bustos, U.S. Representative\nTom Dart, Cook County Sheriff\n\nMike Frerichs, Illinois Treasurer\n\nValerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to the President\n\nChristopher Kennedy, former Chairman of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees\n\nDan Kotowski, former State Senator\n\nLisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney General\n\nAndy Manar, State Senator\n\nBarack Obama, President of the United States\n\nMichelle Obama, First Lady of the United States\n\nPenny Pritzker, United States Secretary of Commerce\n\nPat Quinn, former Governor\n\nKwame Raoul, State Senator\n\nHeather Steans, State Senator\n\nKurt Summers, Jr., Chicago Treasurer\n\nI think its safe to say that Quinn is out for obvious reasons, and Lisa Madigan won't be running as long as her dad is in charge of the assembly.\n\nI think it would be interesting if Barack Obama runs, since he is pretty popular here, and he won't have to worry about compromising with the other.
Also Warren can not run for president unless the GOP governor of Massachusetts is defeated since if she wins he would replace her with a republican senator
He's already made it on Rhode Island a few hours ago
I was there, the line was so long I couldn't even see the front!
What kind of liberties do you have when your working more than 40+ hours a week and still don't have enough money to be over the poverty line?  Is there any liberty when a business can cut wages and benefits, and threaten to move jobs over to China if the workers have a problem with it?  Is there any liberty when lifesaving drugs prices are jacked up for no reason by a greedy corrupt pharma industry?  Or what about is there liberty when large corporate entities use their influence to stifle any new entrepreneurs in starting their own businesses?  And what kind of liberty do we have, when politicians only serve their financial backers instead of their own constituents?\n\nWe support Bernie because we believe education and healthcare should be a right to all American citizens, and shouldn't capitalism mean a fair and equal game where everyone has a chance to succeed?\n\nKeep in mind what Bernie is asking for isn't radical, during Eisenhower's administration the tax rate was as high as 90% and the rich still thrived and made more money despite paying the most taxes.  Besides, wouldn't the rich still benefit if the extra money the spend on taxes leads to more people being able to afford the goods and services they offer?
Less poverty means more customers.  Sure you may end up paying more, but with less people saving money for education and healthcare, better infrastructure bringing more customers to more businesses, and higher wages for working Americans, means a larger number of people have more disposable income.  I don't think you need a degree in economics to know that more customers is always a good thing.\n\nPlus if you look back to the 1950's, the tax rate was at 90% and rich people still remained rich, and that was when Eisenhower was president.
Most black people don't know about Bernie Sanders.  They just see him as a white male senator from the north, taking on a much more visible figure who has had their support for years.  I'm sure once they know more about Bernie they'll cross over to our side.
yes
You can delete the Illinois 10th, Democrat Brad Schneider beat the incumbent Republican. He is a moderate, but he should be receptive to us
They are probably at work or class, 
We need to engage those voters, and not just dismiss them
He better win Bern because someone needs to post #BernFeelstheBern
Agreed, Its reasons like this why I barely have any confidence in this movement.  Sure they talk big, but they don't show up, just like the 2016 primaries.  You need to make the change happen yourself and stop bitching about the problem, be part of the solution.

I never thought i'd see the day where Muslims actually support a Jewish presidential candidate.
would you rather i vote Trump? 
One man isn't the solution to our problems, he's just someone who can do a lot of good.  If people don't organize and mobilize then Trump pretty much takes full power
He is a citizen of Illinois, and since he is no longer president he wouldn't have any obligations in 2018, plus he is only 55, hell even Michelle is qualified too.  Though I think if anyone can beat Rauner it would probably be him.\n\nPlus I think republicans would probably vote for him since most Illinois governors go to jail lol
I just messaged 35 people!  Hopefully we'll get some more votes from them
Is there any offices coming to the North Suburbs?  Because the nearest office is still about an hour away, and I think Bernie could make a lot of inroads with the northeast part of Illinois
They are all voting bernie, in fact two of them voted in the MN caucus
Plus he already declined to run according to wikipedia
If he wins it doesn't matter, what matters is taking over the party at the state level and force our way up the leadership chain.  He'll have no choice but to play ball if all his subordinates are replaced by progressives
I have been trying to look for ways to help in illinois, but for some reason there just isn't any info on how to be part of the party infrastructure here. 
Even if he loses, we need to keep pressing and taking over the state parties.  Even if we have to deal with Tom Perez, he'll have no choice but to go along if he has progressives running things at the state level
The only way to win the game is to change the rules.  The main problem with Obama is that after having a massive coalition of support, he turned his back on them and when laws needed to be passed he went straight to congress, compromising away any reforms with the republicans there.  And Hilary plans to do the same.  Bernie isn't planning on going to the opposition in congress to get bills passed, he will go to their constituents and let them know what they are being denied by their congressman.  It worked for FDR in the 1940s, why wouldn't it work today?
Blade Runner. It's a light-hearted movie about how corporations have taken over the world, and created a race of post-human organic robot gods. It ends well for everyone.

I always interpreted the "red skinned" npcs in 7 as poor people, honestly. Like farmers and lower class folks who are in the sun a lot. I feel like that's a trope in Japanese media, too.

Ah, probably because I was viewing on mobile. I mean, how plausible is this? Are you a political scientist? (not being confrontational, just curious. Sometimes people make grandiose declarations, but they end up being way overblown.)

Man, this movie is going to be terrible. I'm not trying to be cynical, I just don't really see how it can be good. I mean, Hampton Fancher's original screenplay for Blade Runner was ridiculous and terrible, and it took like a million rewrites to get something worthwhile. \n\nBlade Runner was one big mess of happy accidents and compromise. \n\nBlade Runner 2049 is going to be like pretty much every sequel/reboot movie of the last 15 years: Gorgeous, but showing almost no restraint, and hyperactive AF. 
All joking aside.. That last view of the headsets really looked like underwear.

> Socioeconomic factors don't drive anyone into crime?\n> \n> \n> No, they don't.\n\nAs defined by the UN, “poverty is fundamentally a denial of choices and opportunities, and a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one’s food or a job to earn one’s living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living on marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation”\n\nAll of those socioeconomic factors can be traced to negatively impacting African Americans, Latinos and poor whites. The areas suffering these calamities the most are also the hardest hit by crime. \n\nThe *Handbook of Crime Correlates* states that higher SES or Socioeconomic status has a inverse relationship with crime rates:\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=eD0ttBXoMvQC\n\n>A 1921 race riot is the reason why blacks are disproportionately engaging in crime in 2017?\n\nMy point is that organizations that African Americans created by themselves and for themselves in order to create and engender:\n\n- Financial independence and solvency for their community\n- Community togetherness and protection\n- Political cohesion and influence\n\nWere systematically infiltrated and destroyed. Maybe you need to read into COINTELPRO with Nixon and Regan feeding crack into the black communities. \n\nNot many other minority groups in the US have faced the kind of enduring systemic and endemic disenfranchisement that African Americans have.\n\nYou don't think *any* of that might relate to disproportionate crime rates in a particular minority community? Come on.\n\n> they have cultures that emphasised hard work, following the rules and frugality, so they made it. \n\nThat's bullshit - working hard is *absolutely ingrained* in the black community.\n\nBlacks have been stereotyped as being lazy ever since they stopped working for free.\n\nGTFOH
He's trying - true, but look objectively: he's not really succeeding, is he? 
...I don't think he was disputing that.
Can someone explain how this can plausibly be reconciled with Trump's stance re: Israel? \n\nIt seems like his administration will be giving Israel unfettered support in their building of settlements and likely to shield that country from international scrutiny in that regard.\n\nYet - he does this. \n\nWhy?
Who do you think the DOJ reports to man?
Seriously. OP can go fuck themselves imo
I was going to thank you for your post, but your ending absolutely ruins it. \n\nIs /r/uncensorednews ok with racism so long as it's dog whistled?\n\n>Test it. Ask black people who built the pyramids. As always with projection. They accuse us of 'cultural appropriation'. Aaaand it is them that are guilty of it.\n\nEven "experts" disagree about the racial and ethnic makeup of ancient Africa - so your point is a wash. The proper retort to cultural appropriation is that America is a melting pot, and so long as due appreciation is given, mixing of 2 things to create something new is one of great benefits of living in this nation. \n\n> It is an underlying ideology, which now is integrated into cultural marxism. And since blacks are high in the oppression pyramid their views will be accepted if we accept cultural marxism, identity politics. So if they decide, as evidently they have, that white people need to be killed and or enslaved/ forced to pay, work for black people, since they are evil oppressors, then that is what will happen.\n\nThis is more 'us vs them' rationality espoused by the nutjob in the OP. I repudiate it.\n\nAs an African American I think you're both racist.
> Even so, where the leaks came from doesn't matter at all.\n\nHuh? How doesn't it matter? If it didn't matter - why would you spew false, made-up bullshit about it being some Bernie insider?\n\nTrump / Ryan have both seen the classified *evidence*. Yes - their corroboration to the belief that Russians hacked the election serves as a source. So does the Director of National Intelligence and the 17 intelligence agencies who signed the letter I linked. \n\n>What's important is what's in them and here you are defending them. \n\nWhat's in them is far less damaging than the potential collusion that took place between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence. \n\n> Also, what did your precious NYT publish today on it? That they have no substantive evidence of Russian involvement?\n\nAs of "recent weeks" **AND** they're still going through all of the treasure trove of information gleaned from the NSA surveillance. If you think that this is where the buck stops, set up a !RemindMe for a month or even a week and let's see where we are then.\n\n> Again, who leaked doesn't fucking matter. What matters is the content of those leaks. \n\nFunny how 45 and you and the rest of his dim supporters parrot this bullshit - but then you turn around and say leaks coming out of his administration are Un-American. \n\nIt's quite sad that you'll never see just how hypocritical this man has made you, the Republican party and millions of other Americans.
In what way are they lying?
What do you mean they let Orlando happen? 
The world is being saved, by a BLACK WOMAN! 
I wasn't attempting to make one. I was asking you to.
Underrated comment.
You're allowed to think Hillary's infraction was grounds for disqualification (which it was) **and** still be horrified by what Trump has done. 
What kind of nonsense are you talking about? Should none of our government institutions be filled with people who choose to make it their career working there?
What part are you having trouble comprehending?
Due to be paroled in August. He didn't go to jail for molestation - but I think for the way he covered up the payments covering up the molestation.\n\nKind of a fucked up example of "It's not the crime, it's the cover-up"
No I'm comparing how a group (Trump supporters) handled 2 different comments. \n\nOne of these comments came from a man who's been married 3x, regular guest on pedophile Jeffrey Eipstein's plane / private island, reported to have routinely walked into changing rooms while women were in the midst of changing, embroiled in rape allegations from multiple women (one of whom was his own wife) and was even caught on video admitting to sexually assaulting women. The other comment came from a chief advisor to multiple Presidents and who had founded a non-profit in order to make Catholicism a more progressive religion.\n\nOne of those men made incredibly graphic, sexual comments in regards to his own daughter. On more than one occasion.\n\nThe other made an off-hand, innocuous remark about pizza. \n\nWhich one of these men did 45's retarded supporters go after for unsubstantiated claims of pedophilia? Which of these men did 45's retarded supporters attack? Which of these men did 45's retarded supporters **BELIEVE?**
Yeah, like our President being compromised by Russia.
What about his overseeing a massive expansion of the domestic spying apparatus?\n\nHe may have been boring but the man was hardly a saint.
How about you actually click on the link brah. She lays out all of the links right in there. 
I am not going to play this game with you.\n\nIt's called Google.

Well Trump's campaign gives frequent nods to racists and far right fringe groups, so your false equivalency is actually a non sequitur. 
Treason in the presidency should be punished first.
Who the hell still uses a flip phone? 😂
I'm a fellow American?\n\nI'm not removing their agency, I'm stating my opinion.
Point granted, but I would no more respect the Afgani culture of raping little boys than I would a woman being forced to cover herself.\n\nSorry.
The import tax is his proposed "penalty for Mexico" - the only thing is he's starting a trade war that's going to negatively affect you and I.\n\nFurthermore, you should know how the market works:\n\nThis isn't just going to affect products from Mexico, it'll also affect competitors products. If, due to this 20% tax, a product from Mexico used to cost $1.00 will now cost $1.20 - it'll also put pressure on the competitors to raise their prices.\n\nWhy? Because they know that they can raise their comparable product to $1.10 or $1.15 and you'll still buy it because it's still cheaper than the alternative. \n\nYou elected him to create jobs and put more money into your pocket but his policies are already starting to backfire and it's only Day 7.
I hadn't heard about that. It sickens me.\n\nThey need to be stopped. I don't think ISIS is an existential threat to the US - but that doesn't mean I don't think every last one of them shouldn't be shot. 
No, that would be the electoral college and a distinct lack of critical thinking skills. 
Yes, very deVostating.
So...all the Republican Secretaries of State who've investigated this, all of the independent election analysts, all of the watch dog organizations who have investigated this deeply and found nothing are wrong?\n\nBut your one debunked study, against all odds, shows the truth? Yeah ok.\n\nThese are unsubstantiated allegations. If you're not going to believe your President is a Russian puppet without hard evidence, you shouldn't be rushing to believe this nonsense when **ALL EVIDENCE** points towards it being bullshit.
Except....the only ones doing the lying have absolutely no evidence to prop up that assertion, while the ones you say are attempting a coup have troves of it. \n\nSeems like the WH and compatriots are full of shit. 
How about the Holocaust statement that quite blatantly omitted Jews? How about the White House then refusing amend their statement:\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-defends-holocaust-statement-mention-jews/story?id=45148112
So how would you say he's doing so far?
Thank you. 
All the more reason people like you and I need to post here, to make sure their bullshit isn't the only vote that gets seen. 
Yes, it was disqualifying worthy, for more than one reason. \n\nAs Comey stated, if she was still a government employee she'd have faced a slew of punitive actions. The only reasons she didn't is because she wasn't one at the time of the investigation and her massive political clout. \n\nFurthermore, she should have been shamed out of her candidacy, even thinking to run under FBI investigation. It was merely her notorious hubris, that as Colin Powell stated, ruins everything. Any real patriot that puts their country above themselves could see that having a party head run with such scandal would seriously endanger not only their own candidacy, but the candidacies of those running down-ticket as well.\n\nFrom the investigation, to the lower poll numbers, to an primary election strategy that relied on nursing homes, to emaciated looking rallies (the ones that they didn't cancel), to the hacked emails and endless scandals = Hillary faced sign after sign that she wasn't the answer to the country in 2016 and she still refused to drop out.\n\nAway with her, them, and those like her.
So a coup.
It hasn't become America yet. 
Sure. Right after you show us the evidence of "Treason in the intelligence community"?\n\nYou won't be able to, not without doing a sufficient investigation as to why they would be looking to subvert this administration. Such an investigation would lead to Trump's collusion with Russia. \n\nEssentially I made a salacious unsubstantiated declarative to mimic the OP's. \n\nShould also be noted that government officials swear allegiance to the constitution, not the President.
Anyone have a source on if the Senate's opened a likewise investigation and it's authors? 
Hey, in less than 24 hours since we went back & forth - it's now become apparent that not only is Mexico not going to pay for the wall - Americans will be paying for it in double with a proposed 20% import tax.\n\nThat tax will be passed along to the end consumer, meaning you and I. That is in addition to our taxes being used to pay for the wall. \n\nSo in effect, Americans are getting doubly taxed for this ineffective 'meme policy' that is eroding relations with an ally that we share a 2,000 mile border with. \n\nHelp me out here bud. Is this not making things worse?
And? I'm not a resident of Utah either but I still think Jason Gaffetz is a piece of shit and express that view freely.\n\nI'm *allowed* to express my opinions on elected representatives, even if am not involved in their election! I am also able to *campaign* against them - regardless of their locality - so long as I don't commit voter fraud.\n\nYou are completely missing the point.
No, we aren't the ones needing a refresher on the facts. 
I'm with you. They all need to go the way of the DoDo (politically speaking)
What DNC info was leaked by a Bernie insider?
Why are they an idiot?
Socioeconomic factors don't drive anyone into crime?\n\nWhat? Black community and financial organizations like the Black Panthers & Black Wallstreet were systematically infiltrated and dismantled by the government. \n\nMaybe you need to recall the Tulsa race riots where Black Wallstreet was destroyed and hundreds of blacks were massacred by whites.\n\nHere, do some reading:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot
That doesn't disprove the entire document, as we've said intelligence has already been able to corroborate other elements. \n\nAnd that article doesn't talk about the NSA but it was the NSA that tapped the phone of the Russian ambassador that Flynn was talking to, that's why they started monitoring the calls.
Up voted you to get to 1233. Someone be a sport
Holy shit. That blog is a gold mine. Holy fuck. The massive scale of it all. Jesus. What a mind fuck if it's true.

I'm pretty sure he was dead and they retconned him somehow surviving being cut in half.
Things are to the point where pedes are trying to justify this man sexualizing his own daughter. \n\nHe didn't call her beautiful (normal).\n\nHe specifically related to her in a crude, sexual way. \n\nThese are the same people who want to crucify Hillary over some pizza shit conspiracy? 
Your post is utter **horseshit.**\n\nYou have absolutely no evidence to back up your assertion, so how can you say there's "no doubt"?
Yeah other rich white people completely fine with enabling a political dynasty so long as they get their cut.\n\nBarf
Because Clinton was a *horrible* choice!\n\nShe never should have been the candidate! End of discussion! The party didn't just read the room incorrectly, they actively worked to ignore the very loud voices of American voters.\n\nAnd yeah, blah blah 3MM more votes in the primary, done on the back of reducing debates, shutting candidates out of their databases, fundraising money laundering, scheduling ridiculous voter registration deadlines and super delegates. \n\nAll of which Hillary was complicit in.\n\nI don't care about the downvotes but the truth needs to be said. Donald Trump was a piece of shit, but that doesn't make Hillary a diamond in comparison.
I didn't see the Rule 4. If it did I certainly would have posted a discussion starter. My apologies.
You're pathetic
He was a vocal Trump supporter and an early one at that. \n\nHe was a registered Democrat as much as Donald is going to make America great again.
"Sexism and misogyny are not exactly the same things. Sexism, to me, refers to the systemic ways in which women are excluded, degraded, and oppressed, and generally to the ways in which gender is used as an excuse for women's inequality. Misogyny refers specifically to hatred of women."\n-Fredrik deBoer\n\n**Think prejudice vs racism.**
Respect for a people =/= blind adherence to their religious or cultural protocols. 
I don't think Carter Page has been fired. Yet.
I think you can find it in yourself to respond to this person's racist allegations without reducing yourself to racism in turn. \n\nDo you honestly think white people in America haven't been imparted with false senses of accomplishments? This country is what it is today due to the hundreds of years of free labor that slavery provided. Or the millions of acres that was stolen from the Native Americans. Or the billions of dollars saved by / tens of thousands of businesses that rely on undocumented workers from Mexico and other LATAM countries.\n\nThe fundamental misunderstanding of America / western civilization is that, yes - white people were the dominant / leading race during its inception, **BUT** it was never by themselves alone. \n\n*Couldn't someone with your thinking state:* With the election of Trump in America, including the 53% of white women who voted for it, it would seem that whites are on a rampage to destroy humanity and civilization and progress just for the sake of remaining the dominant race (rather than there being **no** dominant race).
> That guy **probably** shouldn't be a cop if that is going to set him off.\n\nAfter all this, and you think he *probably* shouldn't be a cop?

I can provide [evidence](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement) from [credible sources](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trumps-press-conference-highlights-russia.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2Frussian-election-hacking&_r=0&mtrref=undefined&gwh=18CA1EBE440824BB57DBB11D3BC778FD&gwt=pay) to support my assertion that it was the Russians. \n\n["There's no secret here — Russia tried to meddle with our elections," Ryan said. "This is why I'm a fan of the sanctions. This is why I'm a Russia hawk and a Russia skeptic, because their interests don't convene with our interests."- Paul Ryan](http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-trump-russia-flynn-2017-2)\n\nYou have no credible sources to backup your bullshit.
Cool.\n\nAnyone who calls someone an idiot without explaining why is the greatest idiot of all.
At some point politics stop being politics and become human rights. \n\nDisagreements on human rights are absolutely worth ending friendships over.
Despite being blown out of proportion by the Republicans, ISIS isn't an existential threat to anyone outside of countries in the ME.
I'm for respecting cultures, but not when the roots of whatever cultural tradition you're adhering to is based in misogyny and sexism.
> but of which elements that concern Trump have been disproven.\n\nDisproven by whom? There's been no formal investigation. \n\n> Yes, and? I'm sure they had communications with Saudis, Chinese and Indians as well. The content of said communications might constitute treason, the fact that they happened obviously doesn't\n\nWhich is exactly why it wasn't just the phonecall but the frequency of communications that caused the alarm at the NSA. 
Someone being a fiscal conservative, or thinking that abortion should be illegal - is not a point of view I'm willing to end friendships over. \n\nEndorsing policies that disproportionately and discriminately affect minorities, their livelihoods, their health and their families and their security absolutely encroaches on human rights. 
You're ignoring several key distinctions:\n\n* Comey was hired as the FBI director in September 2013, well before the 2016 election cycle\n* Comey had a bipartisan and very respectable past\n* Comey acted in accord to whatever his own motivations, either to personally hurt Clinton or preempt a rogue NY office \n* Flynn was fired by a previous administration due to serious allegations\n* Sally Yates warned the WH almost a month ago Flynn had lied\n* Flynn was being protected by the WH and Republicans until the expose` from the WaPo
:)
I agree with your sentiment....but let's be honest: Obama never gave any inkling of plausibility for those concerns. They were completely unfounded.\n\nTrump on the other hand...
This was such an informative piece.\n\nThank you for sharing.
You have to account for the risk involved. 
How does getting rid of the progressive wing, assist in those returning on any way? \n\nFurthermore, you should examine the costs of corporatism and supporting the military industrial complex more closely. There are always costs. \n\nCorporate hegemony will subsist with either the neoliberal Democrats or the Republicans. The neoliberal Democrats' support for the military industrial complex always causes regression, violence, injustice and suffering. \n\nJust because it isn't happening in America doesn't mean it isn't happening. 
I don't understand, why would a wolrdnews mod think someone trying to corroborate Trump's claims would be an Obama supporter? \n\nSomething is fishy
I'm not condoning this nut case. \n\nMy point is /u/jordansgay states that the left states extremists like this BLM leader doesn't rep their agenda but David Duke does for Trump. \n\nI retorted that the essential difference is that Trump's campaign makes nascent overtures to white supremacists while the left immediately distances themselves from their crazies.
What about the Christopher Steele dossier? That both Obama and Trump were both briefed on?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/world/europe/christopher-steele-trump-russia-dossier.html\n\nOr how the FBI got clued into the Trump campaign's communications with Russians back before the election, and sought 4 FISA warrants against them:\n\nhttp://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/01/guardian-fbi-asked-warrant-monitor-trump-aides
We don't know that. 
Do you fuck bareback? 
"So called" president.
Unsurprising. \n\nI suggest looking into Betsy Devos' remedial English class.
Did you miss gerrymandering? 
Stop what? Mr. Terrific, who's the 3rd smartest man in the world, has theorized there are only 2 people more intelligent then him. \n\nIt was strongly implied those 2 people were Luthor and Batman respectively. 
Isn't evolution just a series of mutations?
Probably in for a reduction of your pell grant, is my guess
This is the retort you provide after calling those in a socially conscious movement idiots?\n\nWould you like to try again?
I trust the front office to do what's right for the Cowboys. Tony has been paid millions he will be fine no matter where they trade him if they trade him. 
That's a Romo pass if I've ever seen one
The only thing dumber than this post would be one that asks " are the patriots better without Brady".
If he's healthy next year him and Lee could be the best LBer duo in the NFL. I so want him to be a stud. I am going to go order a jersey right now. 
Nothing like removing comments you don't like. This might as well be r/the_donald
Church, either Carr or Claiborne. That's it. The rest can go. Williams maybe if we can't get better in the draft. I would love to see a veteran WR here opposite Dez. 
No we are not. Tony has lost plenty of games just like that. In fact Tony has been pretty average in the postseason his whole career. In fact didn't Tony lose to the same packers 2 years ago. 
He 2-4 in playoff games. He also has cost us many games with horrible ints. I can remember one pass he threw right to a redskin on the last play of the season that cost us a playoff spot. I'm tired of sticking up for the loser. The best thing that has come out of this season is the fact that we will finally be able to get rid of him. 
Sorry the dudes dead but the fact is I was extremely tired of his act on the field. Baseball is better off with him out of it. 
Hey moron Daks played pretty good. It's the stupid mistakes and a below average defense that's costing us today. 
That's freaking funny
The bum Jeff Heath made a play holy crap!!!!!!!!
Sorry not even close to being a hall of famer. Sad they've lowered the standards so much. 
Tom Brady might even make the hall way of fame if he could somehow get a good WR...... Maybe.
You know who hasn't made one play this game..... David Irving. Shocking. I mean he only plays good in 1 out 4 games but still. 
GET TO THE CHOPPA!!!!
Irving sucks. Fuck him
That's my owner!!!!!
"Goodbye zeke" has to be the best call this season. I've watched that play dozens of times and it still makes me smile. 
Romo would've stopped that penalty
Bye Romo don't let the door hit you on the way out. 
My only wish for the offense next season is a new right tackle. Free has got to go. 
Romos had plenty of playoff loses worse than this. Romo would've thrown 4 picks in this game. I'm done with Romo I hope we trade his broken ass. 
A second rounder for a player coming off his second acl tear. Pass. I would maybe take him in the 5th round maybe. 
Why don't we resign Leary and move him to martins spot and then move Martin to RT. Wasn't he a tackle in college. I'm thinking he'd be a great RT. 
Dak doesn't have it today? Are you even watching this game. The defense and the stupid penalties are killing us. Moron
I'm not going to give them the clicks. I understand it's probably clickbait I'm still not gonna do it. 
Don't let uncle Joey take you to kindergarten tomorrow. 
I saw the video. I'm not lying. 
Oh I understand but the window for winning in the NFL is open for only so long and you have to have a quality qb in order to win. Romo gives them at least 3 years and a chance to win it all. 
Yep he did do everything he could for this team and he still lost in the second round. It's time to move on from him and let him be the Texans problem. \n
It will never happen but if I'm Houston I would do this trade in a heartbeat. JJ Watt is damaged goods right now. He might never be the player he was before this injury. It would also clear a ton of cap room. 
Dude Romo would've lost this game too. Take your Romo love and shove it up your ass. Go and root for him on the Texans next year. I'm tired of listening to you fools. 
Shut up Daks playing good. Our defense and stupid players are costing us. 
Question did 2014 Tony Romo win the super bowl? How about making it to the super bowl? How about making it to the NFC championship? No so I guess we didn't miss much from him then. 
Dak didn't struggle mightily. He played pretty good in almost every game except the Giants game. GTFO here with that crap. 
As a lifelong cardinals fan this makes me happy!!!!
I guess we didn't finish this fight!!!
Yeah I remember that coach that won those 2 Super Bowls went on to win a dozen more with the Dolphins. Oh wait no that's not right he washed out of the NFL after 3 seasons. Barely finishing over .500. I do believe that Jerry went on to win another super bowl with that great coach. Jerry is one of the best owners in NFL history. Fact end of discussion. 
Why would the Deadskins take another te. Don't they have like 40 already. 
Any answer other than bob Lilly is wrong!
No it's a shit post
I'm sorry I'm not gonna support a party that puts a anti Semite into power. He shouldn't be anywhere near the leadership of the DNC. 
Elliot 
Once again when it counts Romo went to shit. That's a fact. You can state all the stats when the games don't matter but when it truly matters Romo didn't produce. Look at his playoff numbers. Avg 220 yards 1.3 touchdowns a game. That's very Brock osweiler like. 
So if they predicted no ice and a huge ice storm hit then you'd be bitching about why they didn't postpone the game. Stupid people complain about the weatherman being wrong and tv commentators. 
Romo would've stopped that FB run
How many people here would kill themselves if Romo ended up on the redskins. Lol
Guys this defense isn't good enough. We are a young team. We need more playmakers on here. See ya next year. 
Ken Norton Jr. When he left for the 49ers after the Cowboys won the super bowl in '93. I loved that guy and he went and left us for our biggest rival. Then that bastard won it all the next year. Holy crap I was pissed. 
We will never know but I don know that Romo DID shit his pants on that team. 
Yeah our receivers didn't drop any passes yesterday....... Oh wait butler dropped one in the end zone and Williams dropped a first down too. Let's not forget all the mistakes that the other players made yesterday. Dak played as good a playoff game yesterday as Tony has ever played. I'm sorry Tony didn't get the chance to play with this team but that's how football works sometimes. 
Romo would've made our defense better. 
Trump would like that answer!
Go root for Romo on the Texans next year then 
I don't know why everyone hates the logo. I kinda like it. 
This answer wins the thread

Did win, let's face it. The primary was fraudulent.

Rick remarried when he went back in time, he loved Glen so much he had only daughters.
Religious indoctrination is not thought crime, it is brainwashing children and the weak minded to practice cognitive dissonance. You could easily ban the practice and indoctrination of superstition and still have philosophical differences and political discourse.
That's fair, but instead of people going crazy and crying end of the world, we could try to get trump to spell his name in solar panels across Texas or something. Quit crying and go to work.
Draw a cock on them. Watch how fast they get fixed.
Not after they knowingly sold medical supplies infected with HIV. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785997 When I think about it I have to relax in my Tempur-Pedic bed with my Disney stuffed animals.
How about the current slaves in wealthy Middle Eastern countries? No one wants to talk about them or the fact that the refugees don't go there because they would likely get the same treatment.
And the incest.
It's better than no one talking about it. We must remind ourselves of the wolves still roaming free.
Ugh, how retarded does an adult have to be to write that?
Stop trying to win with opinion then. How about pitching some good ideas his way that would benefit everyone and make him think he gets rich in the deal. Giant aqueducts, solar panel fields, electric car plants, and other socially responsible projects. 
I have like 10 Ricks to call.
You are missing the point that instead of the employer just paying for health care, the employer is deciding what healthcare to provide their employees based on religious beliefs. The employer's religious beliefs are being held higher than the employee's beliefs. 
If the premise of the show was to be satire, there should be at least one funny thing in the trailer.
It really helps to not be a corrupt and vile group of lizards wearing a trench cloak. 
So many people forgetting that there is a legal immigration process that these scum are dodging. These are law breaking scum that deserve to be sent back. 
You can when it ignores easily obtained information.
Eat a salad and have some pineapple.

Holy shit. I don't care about politics. Devine worship and prophecy is banned. It's not fucking complex.
Mmm, tastes just like raisins.
Unless an agenda is being pushed.
One side has a lot more guns.
Can't we cut to Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea in chains yet?
Careful, she might eat it.
They are corporatists.
He meant Maggy not Judith. 
You da real VIP.
Well there are damn good reasons to not want immigrants from certain areas. I think the travel ban could use some additional countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE ect. 
Why not both?
Again, ICE is due process. They aren't being gunned down. They are staying in the US illegally, and being removed by due process. Remember that Obama removed more illegal aliens than Bush Jr.
No. The employees should get a health care plan that covers 100% medical care. Employers should pay for said health care. Health care should include dental and eye care as well. There is no reason an employer should know the details of an employees health care unless it prevents them from working.
I just imagine you building an actual trigger.
That poor hundred millionaire. I can't wait to watch her trial.
The retard is actually trying to say it was just a smear campaign, like Clinton wasn't the most corrupt and treasonous cunt to walk the earth.
Unless it's video of their trial.
I can not see this without wanting to hit the idiot who thinks it's a good idea to clap at people in the most patronising way to get a point across. Go👏 back 👏to 👏sesame👏 street.
Corruption, treason, fraud... take your pick.
So you won't watch the content, but you want to give your opinion on those who did watch the content? Why are you here?
Isn't it funny that people who cry sexism always care more about what is between someone's legs than the content of their character?
There is no room, I just call their god a lazy and mean child after that until they stop trying to share their fairytale.
An employee deserves their wages and healthcare regardless of their employers superstition of choice. You are giving an employer control over their employees freedom of/from religion.
I am an anti theist. I do think religion is evil and I do think religious institutions should be eradicated. Superstition should not have the same protection as free speech. Religious indoctrination should be seen as hate speech or inciting violence.
1. The pic shows a dollar in change. 2. Current statistics are at 93 cents to the dollar, and the 7 cents is due to part time, job type ect. The feminists can't even use current numbers to sell their lies. 
It is hilarious how many people can't see that ICE is due process. 
Now I feel bad with my 75-100$
She reminded me of a Stepford wife.
The trailer left out that it is supposed to be satire, and the writer makes it seem like genuinely self hating racism.
I really hope Putin and trump skip through the middle east bombing shit and installing Shitty colleges
You aren't paying teachers to entertain you. You are paying them for the exchange of knowledge. For them to say you can't reuse said knowledge is asinine.
We should set up a mental hospital for his guests.
I was trying to point out that the racists on the left will try to use the satire excuse even though they will take the movie deadly serious. The writer is literally tweeting "Fuck white people" and he is a white guy. This regressive left BS has to go.
There was a great Noam Chomsky quote earlier about controlling people by allowing limited discussion that seems appropriate.
Facts are not attacks. 😂
Or Malcolm in the middle.
Why did that article end in superstition? WTF, now I can't be sure if anything else in it is credible. 
Asking for identification is not unreasonable search.
Don't be stupid. Anything with a creation myth and claims of knowing the will of god or gods through divine spectacle is not allowed to indoctrinate children or collect money without tax.
Why don't we just stop giving the leader of a cult media attention?
Stopping someone to check their ID is fine with me.
The Dems also broke the economy when they killed Glass/Steagall 
😂I wish, if I was Musk I would build a giant city in the ocean that eventually becomes a space station/ second moon.
We ended up with Trump because the DNC was too corrupt.
Bernie lost because of fraud and election rigging.
None of which is in the trailer. IF..., IF this is satire, it's poorly done.
And why didn't he correct her ridiculous definition of fascism? She is a teacher, he should have made her read from a book.
This is why we can't have nice things.
What is wrong with starting an intellectual war on religion? And why is it acceptable to believe in nonsensical superstition in a time where you have a vast network of information online? Why shouldn't I judge someone by the faith they lead their lives with? Religion should not be above discussion or beyond questioning. I personally feel it is immoral to teach children religion as fact because it undermines their world view and strips them of empathy for other philosophy and cultures.  
Kek
I'm cuntfused, can you blackucate me? See how racist and sexist that sounds?
Cops can absolutely search you if they have probable cause. Crossing borders is probable cause. If you don't want to be caught with tons of cocaine then you shouldn't traffic cocaine. A cop asking for Identification is not unreasonable search.
Stop trying to save a dying animal, let's create a replacement single payer system.
Looks cleaned up, but that's just how sexy those birds are.
I was adding my own version. Yes I was referring to that meme.
"DO YOU THINK I'M PRETTY?!? YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING AT ME!"
Treat money as a foreign power and you will see that it isn't that big of a deal if our temporary leader to be on good terms with another world leader, but it is disturbing how many bankers and corporate stooges are in being promoted or hired. 
Prove it.
Why there isn't a less lethal blunderbuss that is intended to knock down someone like this is beyond me. Every police car should have a riot gun that shoots rubber.
Ideologies are not race. Calling someone a foolish Muslim is about their world view not their skin color. It's not even bigotry, secularism is objectively better than theocracy.
"It has turned racial, but it's not racist."
My go to is the instructions on how to treat slaves in the Bible, or the 7 headed dragon that is to be expected. What childish moron believes in dragons?
You are right, maybe then less people would have voted for Hillary.

Oh no, it's retarded. How would we all be outlaws? Citizens or legal migrants shouldn't have anything to be worried about. People who dodge the legal process and are here illegally deserve to be sent back until they can stay here by legal means. 
Dudes leg was totally tapping "help, he rapes us with bamboo" in Morse code.
How about the simple federal crime of storing classified information on personal hardware? How about accepting bribes for political favors? How about rigging a primary?
Do you think an employer has the right to push their religious beliefs on their employees?
Should have been Bernie. The left is so toxic now because Hillary played identity politics. Where is the leadership on the left denouncing the violence? I'm waiting...
You are taking hyperbole as a literal statement. I think trump is benign when you get a feel for his lingo. The man is simple, his ego drives him and he talks in hyperbole. This could be used to great advantage of anyone was to shame him into great action.
REEEEE!
You said cops can't search with probable cause. Maybe a typo, but that seems to be your argument. Cops can absolutely ask for ID. 
Yeah... it's a stupid question for real world implementations.  If you ever have a real subnet of that size then the broadcasts alone would kill it.
Block her back.  Assert dominance.
But my Roy score is off the charts man.
Bernie has enough integrity to not roll over and say you should vote for anyone.  That would be against his message that we need money out of politics.\n
Yeah that was the second part of the first paragraph.  You could just add a subnet to that vlan and get your DHCP to hand out both groups of addresses.  I didn't know if you wanted them to all be adjacent but if you really don't care about breaking them up like that then you should be fine.
You're saying this like Trump won't have them thrown in some black site for making fun of him before.
Why does someone have to put a label on something to discount the things that they're saying?  I don't need to know who you are to realize that you're a person who has feelings/problems/life that's different than mine.  I respect you as a person with an idea and I expect the same in return.  Unfortunately you have to try to boil me down into a gender/race/class/sexual orientation.  That's mighty big of you /s.  You should be ashamed but of course you'll discount that idea because I'm privileged somehow in your eyes.\n\nFuck you and all the people that want to divide a country with labels.  That's exactly what the Republican's are doing.  You sure you're not one?
Usually you can do this but before you reboot you have to make sure you fdisk /mbr.  This will remove grub from the MBR and let it boot just Windows.  This may have changed since Windows 7 and you might have to use the EasyUEFI tool that is mentioned below.

Well it'd be self-assertion of dominance since you're showing yourself that you don't need to seek anything from her anymore.  Usually the submissive one is the one that wants approval.  Just change now so hopefully your future relationships will be better by you realizing that you're not putting up with being walked all over.
Yup it is.  I know that full well.  I just see it slowly getting worse under Hillary and getting drastically worse under any republican.  I want a revolution sooner rather than later because all I see is big money continuing to control our government until they democratically vote them out or have a real revolution.  I hope it's the first but all of the republicans and Hillary get their money from the same people.  They hedge their bets well.
Since it's un-win-able then why not vote no?  They intentionally waited to put forward these people.  We know they're going to get confirmed but you think the other side would just vote yes?  It's a whole charade anyways.  I want a party to come out and be like 300: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHxIssSROjk
Yeah man... well maybe my incident was back when there was only one teacher that actually could understand what I did and I was told that I disrupted printing in some other room by port scanning.  So obviously they had some idiot IT person say something against me.  It's probably better to do everything in the cloud and not mess with the local computers (if you get full access back).  You can fight all this but they make all the rules so it's almost better to just let them think they're right and just recover your backups from your home.  Fighting with idiots that make the rules never gets things changed from my experiences.  Especially when you're under-aged and have little to no power.  
Yeah... honestly I'm tempted to watch the country implode by voting for republican.  My vote for Hillary would be for Republican lite.  If Trump was president then it would just crash and burn and hopefully something great would come out of the ashes.  There's always more choices than Bernie and Hillary.
Obviously the other side has to resort to call mods in to cry about it.  I don't really care about it that much to run to a mod.
Don't take any of this seriously.  Just fly under the radar at school from now on.  High school is a joke for Comp Sci kids.  Unfortunately you have to play by their rules while they're as antiquated as most most institutions go.  I don't know how much time you have left (oh sophomore... well you learned your lesson early and it looks like you'll have a target on your back for another two years) in school but it's not worth rocking the boat since usually teachers are stuck there too and don't want to stick their neck out for you.\n\nSource: I port scanned the gateway of a high school because I was in CCNA class back in 2000 (Just for lulz of course).  Something set off an alarm somewhere but they didn't even know it was me until I was naive enough to just confess to it as I'd never been to the principal's office ever.  The police liaison threatened me with jail time and shit.  They ended up trying to throw the book at me and ended up giving me two weeks out of school suspension.  It was my senior year end so I ended up failing a class or two but I had already gotten into college so I didn't get affected much by it.  One of the IT teachers apologized to me after that she never spoke up and defended me.  It was a nice two week vacation but my parents didn't like it so much.  
Sorry for the potato quality but as an ISP this is all we need at 1 Wilshire.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/9QUTF
I'd go with netgear or asus.  Of course the more you pay the better it's going to be so YMMV.  I'd probably look for a 2.4ghz/5ghz router.  Probably find better deals online if you can wait.

How about surprise blowjob?  Like when you're awoke by one.
Real world you'd hope that you plan ahead and put a big enough subnet there for the possible expansion... but yes if you already have devices in a subnet like servers then you can just add another subnet and let dhcp/vlan sort it out.\n\nSubnetting is super important as a network admin.  I currently work as a Network Admin for an ISP so I work with VLSM on a daily basis.  When working with private IP addresses I wouldn't tend to be so strict in how many IP's you're "wasting".  By allocating a /22 or /21 or /20 to a subnet you're not really "wasting" real IP addresses.  The odds are that you'll never run out of private space.  Broadcasts don't get too crazy over that size (or you can limit the ports to eliminate broadcast storms).  You can keep adding and adding and adding subnets do a vlan but then it gets hairy trying to track people down if you're trying to identify computers by IP and in separate physical locations.  It's just easier to put all the servers on one subnet and then leave the DHCP clients on another just in case you feel the need to grow the subnet later.\n\nOnce you start working every day with /21-/30 subnets then it'll become second nature.  The only issue is to make sure you're not overlapping another subnet.
You forgot the bacon... must never forget that.
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE.... I paid for <something> and everyone else should have to pay for it too.  I wish people weren't so close minded before reading what someone or something is all about.\n\nFree public tuition is far from the government paying for an ivy league education for everyone.  When the country gets free public school then we get a smarter work force and can produce/consume/invent more.  Do you think free public K-12 school is bad too?  There are private schools but everyone deserves to be able to reach their full potential.  
Welp, I'm done.  Good luck to you in the coming business year.
Well it's not a big deal but she's running on the position that she's going to rein in wall street, fix the system, and hold people accountable.  She then turns around and thinks that the rules don't apply.  I was with Bernie when he said there are more important things to talk about than the e-mails but the underlying aspect is that she thinks she's above the law.  With how much effort is being spent to pour over the e-mails already there has to be some blatant evidence that she was careless and reckless with sensitive data.  Snowden exposes that mass surveillance is happening to US citizens and Hillary says that he's a traitor.  She, irresponsibly, miss handles the same data and thinks it's nothing.
Too bad our future is intrinsically connected.  I'll just be doing what average americans have been doing for years... voting against their best interests.  If things have to get worse to get better then I'd rather that worse being drastic than the slow decline of the middle class how it has been going.  Hillary has supported Republican ideals.  While Bernie was getting arrested for sit-ins against segregated housing she was trying to help Barry Goldwater get into office.  While Barry might not have been super conservative you can't say it's not supporting the other side if you want to clearly define republicans are bad and democrats are good.

Unfortunately her career is not solid.  Poor judgement on Iraq, supporting the TPP by voting 45 times for it, and even working on the campaigns of republicans for office.  If you don't trust what someone is saying to you then how can you even vote for them?  I want someone who has conviction.  Not someone that blows with the prevailing winds.  If we never fought any battles that we didn't think we could win then we wouldn't have black rights, women's rights, gay rights, along with most of the other progressive policies out there.  Let's just have this broken system some more because it'd be hard enough to fix it and make it better?  I've waited 33 years knowing that the system is broken.  I'm done waiting.

You can probably now get the same flash drive for $20.  Sometimes the fight isn't worth it.  Maybe it's just best to deny it's even yours now.  Since they've had it in their hands then you can say you're not responsible for the contents on it now.  I bet if you went to these "attorneys" they'd laugh at you because it's not worth their time as well.

Well honestly I'm excited that people are getting into politics.  If you're not excited about that then that's sad because we need more young people to get excited.  When there's high voter turnout then democrats win.  Considering that reddit is a younger demographic I'm not surprised that it's 90% of the articles.  84% under 30 voted for Bernie in Iowa.  Maybe there's something to that?  He's not the next coming of Jesus.  He's just an honest man that wouldn't have run if Elizabeth Warren had run.  He's trying to unite everyone and get money out of politics.  Is that such a hard premise to get behind?  I'd like to think that it isn't.  30+ years of fighting for the middle class in office and he just wants to leave the US better off than we are now.

Are you so quick to realize that NAFTA was a bad free trade agreement?  The TPP will just allow more countries to set up shops overseas and use their low wage workers to produce goods.  Then they'll just sell it back to american's at a lower cost than anyone could produce it in america.  They'll also keep more and more profits overseas.  That's why so many jobs were lost to NAFTA.  \n\nIraq was a mistake?  Tell that to the 500k+ families that lost someone over there.  Pretty big mistake.  Is she going to use the same reasoning skills on future issues?  I don't see Bernie having that kind of short sighted reasoning when it comes to huge issues like the lives of our military.\n\nHer knowledge of foreign policy is great.  That says nothing of her poor judgement.  Bernie gives her credit where credit is due and that's the sign of a humble person.  After Iowa, even while the votes were not in, Bernie congratulated Hillary and Martin for running a good campaign and discussing issues.  I saw no mention of anyone from Hillary in her "I'm pretty much the winner" speech.  While Hillary does know more about foreign affairs, I would think that Bernie knows more about US affairs.  He's had more experience in government than her.  He knows what we need to do here.  Honestly I'd rather someone know what we need locally then worry about inserting ourselves into foreign issues.  There's people that he can surround himself with to give him advice on issues.\n\nShould we not have elected Barack then?  We all knew that the Republican's were going to block him at every chance they had to minimize his impact.  We wanted change.  We still need change and Hillary will be more of Bill than Barack.  Bernie is all about first getting money out of politics that will continue with a huge push in the midterms to vote for democrats that will promote his changes.  If that happens I believe we will finally be able to change our broken system and hold people accountable for crashing our economy.  Maybe we can be like Iceland.  They jailed their bankers for causing the collapse and forgave a good portion of mortgage debt.  I don't see anything like that happening on Hillary's watch.
Where the fuck have you been?!?! Welcome to the Rock.
What if Hillary changes her mind back to pre-2013 about marriage between a man and a woman?  She was so progressive in 2013... Never know if she gets enough money she could change her mind.\n\nHere is what real progressive looks like so... you're welcome?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFlQ6fU4GM
I work for Webpass (Now Google Fiber(ish)) but we've always over deliver on speeds.  Most people are hooked up saying we'll bring 200mbit and we bring 500mbit.  We also do gig speeds to buildings for 60 a month.  Best thing IMO is that we don't require a modem.  No modem rental fee or FCC fee or anything like that.

There should be a good bar to go to.  Drinking games like everytime Benghazi is mentioned? =D
Unfortunately a lot like myself think that Hillary will be another 8 years of Bill.  While Bill did help he also installed people that could undermine the middle class and give more handouts to the rich.  Yes he was better than the Republican choice but they're all in bed with big money.  To think that any true policy will be made to make the middle class back into the real middle class when it was first invented is a blatant lie.
The event doesn't start until 8.  Be prepared to stand around.

Yes... I'll concede that he probably will.  I know that I wouldn't but I'm not a politician because I'm sure the backlash from not supporting her would resonate throughout the establishment to kick him out of politics.  I believe that despite what animosity he has for her and the establishment that he would make nice to be able to continue to fight for the middle class.  Beyond the politician he's a humble person and just wants the best for us.\n\nLuckily this won't have to happen.  You can keep your money.  You can donate it to veterans.  You can donate it to Bernie after he wins.  It doesn't matter since this country is waking up to the fact that he is more trustworthy than her.

Unfortunately the lesser of two evils is how this country has operated for a long time.  I don't think it should be that way.  When I see someone honest that has fought for the rights of the people while not taking huge donations and saying "oh the money they gave me won't affect the way I lean at all" tends to make me not believe them.\n\nI really don't see Clinton vowing to put anyone in that will overturn Citizen's United.  Bernie said he won't appoint anyone that doesn't come out as against it.  When she's changed her mind (or evolved whatever) I just don't trust it.  When I say I'm going to do something I keep my word.  I think reputation is all that we have as people and she's shown time and time again that she changes her stances magically as they become popular.  \n\nI'm tired of settling.  I want all of us not to settle.  This is our country.  The rich have run it for a long time now.  When I see someone that has less in his savings than their opponent that gets that money for an hour of speaking fees then it tells me who's side they're on. 
Sanders has been in political office for 30+ years and marched with Dr King in the civil rights movement.  He's been talking about all the things he supports now for the last twenty years.  You can see all this by looking on youtube.  He's cared about the people of Vermont and I doubt you'll hear a bad word about him from anyone there.  All this while not taking any form of private money, not running any negative campaign ad against his opponents, and being an independent from no political party.  He stands up for all the citizens that don't make millions of dollars a year no matter what they believe in.

What if Clinton flip flops on issues that her big super PAC donors wanted her to support after she gets in office?  The head lobbyist for the TPP already said he thinks she'll change her mind if she's elected.  She's so disingenuous.

I could care less if you want to warn/ban me for being "uncivil".  I gave the other person ample opportunity to discuss the issue without taking it outside of political discourse.  As the other party decided to try to label me based on gender/sexual orientation/race then I don't feel bad using such super bad words as "fuck".  Have fun being high and mighty.  I'll be sure to unsubscribe to this reddit and remind myself that this reddit is only for sanitized political conversation... while others get to attack personally. 
Well with such independent websites like isidewith.com that take into account your positions and tell you what politician you align closely with it's easier now than before to find out what side you fall on.  You shouldn't believe or trust anything until you read it and decide for yourself.  Reddit is just a place where you can see pointers to articles.  At least Reddit is MOSTLY not co-opted by the wealthiest people jamming their version of the "news" down your throat.  I'd take Reddit to be more independent of money but I still read shit for myself and take my own conclusions.  Hillary just seems to switch positions when it is convenient for her and she takes millions in speaking fees from the rich and tells us that she won't feel like she'll owe them anything when she's in office.  She has a tendency to favor the companies that have given money to the Clinton foundation before and I wouldn't trust her to not give her financial buddies favorable deals while as President.
You killed it?  You monster!
Does the 172.16.0.0/22 have servers in it that are static?  Usually I'd just take the next 172.16.4.0/21 and assign it to that network and then have the DHCP start handing out new addresses until everyone is moved over to the new subnet (assuming you want the whole subnet to have adjacent IP's).  If not, then just add another /24 or /23 to your /22 and put them on the same vlan.\n\nFor your new department you can just keep going with your 172.16.3.100 but of course you'll need to make sure not to overlap subnets.  
That's the price they quoted me at when I signed up. I would go in and talk to them. It's at 1835 market street

When these articles start off by labeling Bernie as a socialist without putting "democratic" anywhere near the word, I immediately stop reading.  Why?  If you're going to attack someone's policies at least get the term democratic socialist right.  He's far from extreme socialism where the government controls the means of production or the socialism that states that people have no right to their own land.\n\nWhere these articles set out to bash someone without being at least honest about what form of socialism he ascribes to then it's all just fluff since the next part of the article will inherently be about more attacks without substance.

I do want us all to come together and push toward goals.  I'm skeptical when people say goals are out of our reach.  We're a nation of doing things that others haven't but for the last 30 years we've let our education/poverty/middle class/society slip into a coma.  Why can't we do what many other nations have proved can be done and done successfully like health care, livable wage, free public college, and a thriving middle class.  To say that these goals are out of reach is a lie.  I hope for the first time that Americans don't vote against their interests and elect someone that's fine with the current state we're in.

By trying to marginalize me you're doing the same thing.  You're discriminating on the premise that you've already built in your head of who your enemies are.  Don't you look in the mirror?  I'm sorry that I chose my race right?  I should be sorry?  I should be sorry that I wasn't born into the minorities.  The reason that movements are successful is because the minorities realize that there are people that want basic human rights and dignities for EVERYONE.  People that don't realize that disgust me.\n\nRevolution happens one of two ways.  We can either have a democratic revolution where the people rise up and vote their power or things get so bad that there's a physical revolution.  We need someone that will drastically change things the former way or I think the latter way will have to be taken.  With eight years of Hillary the middle class will shrink more.  The banks will keep doing what they've always done.  There will be more TPP and more offshore migration of jobs.  Someday the middle class will get fed up.  Would you rather me rip the bandaid off fast or slow?  Both are painful.   I'm tired of everyone saying everything is fine and that we're the greatest country.  We're not.  If we go by people in jail then we're the greatest at that.  That's it.\n\nYou're false about your time machine.  There have been societies throughout history that have honored differences in their population.  It depends on also where you go in history.  Just because the history of this country is racist, bigoted, and sexist doesn't mean I'm at fault for your poor treatment.  I'm sorry to burst your narrative that everyone not like you is against you.

This could be a question for askhistorians but can someone explain why Berlin was such an important place for the the allies to control after ww2? Does it have any real strategic significance besides being the capital of Germany? To simplify my question: Was Berlin actually important to control or was it just just a shiny trophy that everyone wanted on their mantelpiece?
On the latest common sense podcast, dan Carlin and James Burke have a pretty interesting discussion on this kind of thing. Anyone who is interested in what the future of politics could look like might enjoy it.
Agreed. I was just asking because it really is the mark of a leader to lead even after they lose an election - to keep fighting for what they believe. It's the mark of a strong leader to fight even when the outcome looks bleak.  Hillary is showing she didn't deserve the top job.
What is the point of him doing rallies still? Shouldn't he be focused on becoming the president?
The statement is pretty misleading from her. Correct me if I'm wrong but Prussia is still a state in Germany and was the main force behind German unification in the 1800s...so saying they no longer exist is like saying the 13 colonies no longer exist...technically true but extremely misleading.

If anyone here also likes reading, David Simon was a reporter for the Baltimore sun and wrote two books that kind of form the ground work for the wire: Homicide, a year on the killing streets and The Corner. In homicide he observed the baltimore homicide unit for a year. In the corner he followed drug dealers and addicts (basically the other side of the law) for a year. They're both pretty interesting.

I don't ever want to see the last name "Clinton" in regards to politics again from here on out
It's not just liberals...would republicans not be on board with the idea of ranked voting? Choosing the candidate they like the most rather the candidate the hate less? 
Is there a way to send a message to republican congressmen that we'd support them more if they put the country before the party and did something in this case?
 I'll give my two cents. I'm not a huge Hillary fan by any means. But between the two, so much of what I read about trump points to the fact that he is running purely for himself. There are numerous stories that he stiffed contractors working for him and other people who do business with him. He's declared bankruptcy 4 times. Trump university was a sham that ripped off a decent amount of people. Hillary has her flaws of course, but She knows the political system at least. I'm not excited about her presidency but at least I feel at some level she cares about people. So many things trump has done (mostly ripping off contractors and small businesses) show me there is some fundamental flaw with him. 
This is great advice, thank you. 
Wanting to know more about her, I watched this speech: \n\n[Betsy DeVos speech](https://youtu.be/fFSn9GzT8OI) \n\nI went in with a fair and open mind but when she implied that Prussia is no longer a country because they had a bad public school system, I couldn't believe she'll be heading the department of education. \n\n
That's the original version of the song 
I don't get this though...the only people in his cabinet are billionaire globalist elites. How are they going to take on the system? Why doesnt the_donald see this?

I'm agnostic because I can't honestly say we know a god doesn't exist.  I'm atheist because I don't believe a god exists due to lack of convincing evidence.

First, I commend your open-mindedness and your desire to understand all sides.  If more believers were like you I doubt we'd have a problem at all.  I'm also heartened that you have reached out to better understand your son's point of view.  My own parents have made no such attempt at all.\r\rSecond, I was a Southern Baptist for 20 years, and while I don't know the specific sources your citing I'm sure I was repeatedly convinced by the same kind of claims as you are for the majority of my life.  Trust me when I tell you my faith was strong.  However when I was in my late 20s I was forced to take an honest look at my beliefs, and quickly found that I had been persuaded to believe because a) most of the people I knew believed it and either parroted the same "evidence" to back up their beliefs or believed in faith alone, b) all of the authority figures in my life not only assured me they were correct but also told me unbelief was a sin punishable by hell(because only an unsaved person can truly doubt and unsaved=hell), and c) these things led to confirmation bias consistently reaffirming my belief.  After all, wouldn't i rather be wrong about god and lose nothing than to risk eternity in hell by not believing.  This mindset undoubtedly leads to seeing evidence where there is none.\r\rI understand that as a believer, knowing your son doesn't believe scares you to death.  But if you truly and critically examine the evidence that convinces you that god exists I'm almost sure you'll find it doesn't add up.
All magic is evil unless it comes from an invisible wizard who lives in space.
I'm afraid not.  Atheist who claim to know god doesn't exist are gnostic atheists.  They are also referred to as "strong atheists".  You can be agnostic about more than just a god's existence.  For instance I'm also agnostic about the existence of Bigfoot.  Agnosticism simply means that you don't claim to know 100%.
How do you know he's not ironically making the presuppositional argument as a joke?  That's how I read it.

I did ACE from 7th grade thru "graduation"(GED), and yes it is horrible, especially concerning history and science.  I've had to teach myself in those subjects in the past few years.  Plus in every book are these comics shoving Christian ideals down your throat.  I feel like i would been better off learning nothing than learning this pathetic drivel. 
In my experience it's much more common for two young people to rush into marriage because they want to fuck each other.  I attended a Baptist College where the "urban legend" was the campus lake was full of engagement or wedding rings from these failed brief marriages.  I personally knew several couples who got married after 1-2 months of knowing each other, only to see them get divorced soon after or have to stop hanging out with them because they hate each other now and they're just intolerable even when they're apart because they just can't understand what God is trying to teach them.  More often you'd just hear about some kids making a huge mistake and "now they have to get married".  
I absolutely agree that the needs of the many should always outweigh the needs of the few.  Our(my) problem is that the most vocal believers seem to think it is best for all to convert to their belief, and that because of that belief they should be allowed to discriminate against those who don't share that belief.\r\rEdit(additional comment):  If you have evidence that your god exists then where is it?  If you believe the laws of this country should be based on your ideologies alone then you better come correct with the evidence.

I will concede that many, especially those who "deconvert" from religion to atheism, will go through a period of agnosticism only before arriving at atheism.  It happened to me and I believe it to be only natural.  It's difficult to go from strict belief to strict disbelief, so a period of saying "I don't know" or "I don't know if I believe or not" only serves to soften the transition.  Again this is only my opinion based on my own experience but hopefully it will clear up this misunderstanding you seem so keen on.

Oh yeah he's definitely in the master race.
The realization that my faith(Christianity) offered nothing that wasn't offered by other faiths.  Every faith has holy scripture; every faith has a central figure; every faith claims special knowledge given directly to them by their own god(s); every faith claims their own miracles; every faith claims to be the absolute truth while dismissing all other strictly because "they can't all be true and it's not possible that I am wrong".  I lost my faith after telling a coworker that I couldn't offer any tangible evidence that my beliefs were true yet still believed because I thought I'd had a personal experience, and only then did I realize that meant there really was no reason to continue believing. 
Thanks a fucking lot then because you helped do this to us.
This post is so nuts my teeth are talking to me now.

At the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist, it's due to a smear campaign by the Church.  When I was young growing up in a fundamentalist household, I was taught that Atheists were in open rebellion against God, capable of any immoral action and therefore not to be trusted.  My best friend's dad wad an atheist and I was essentially taught that he was an immoral person even though he was very nice and decent.  In my opinion this is done to discredit anyone who doesn't believe so the faithful wouldn't even consider anything they had to say.
My son is 8 and my daughter is 7.  I appreciate the response.
"Home pickup only."
This definitely isn't endearing me to Nickelback.  They're one of the most (inexplicably)successful acts of the past 20 years, no matter what any of us think about their music.  They also apparently have zero sense of humor about themselves.  What entitled little assholes.
*whisper* You said Fuckabees.
I'm down.  
Kids born of women young enough to graduate in the 90s are old enough to put pictures of that on Reddit.  Crazy.
It's a compliment either way.  May his reign last a thousand dark years. 
Apologies.
Came here specifically to upvote this inevitable comment.
What YouTube channel is this?  My daughter loves those videos :/.
Truly sorry man I was upset.  My apologies.
I would object that it's lazy, but also that if Luke is Rey's father then that means he abandoned her on Jakku to live in abject poverty as a scavenger dependent on what Unkar Plutt feels like giving her for her trouble.   That just might ruin Luke for me, and he's my favorite character. 
Is that you, Hillary?
Or maybe don't play with women's emotions just to pass the time.  I don't want to be a buzzkill but this is one of the things that has to change.  It's not a joke to make anyone feel bad about themselves especially when all they did was pose for a picture with their friends.  Oh BTW I'm a 33 year old man. 
Dude check out Frank Howarth.  He's an awesome woodworker and his videos are incredibly high quality.
Same here.
No, Scott is a weird asshole.
Yeah it was degrading and I regret having said it.  
Ummm... where are the mods?
Oh definitely message me when you get a place because I am very interested. I wish I could help you out more but I just moved here.
Fucking quiet AF I can hear the blood in my damn veins
He would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those meddling younglings and their stupid Tauntaun.
Should have mentioned I don't have a car atm so it's gonna have to be in Boulder.  Appreciate the response though.
Peace be upon him(followed by jerking off gesture).
Came here for some Kool-aid but it looks like you guys drank it all.
Thanks everyone for the response, but to really get this going we'll need you all to tweet him and others like him directly.  But seriously thanks for the upvotes I just broke 2000 karma :).
I would if I could but I'm living in poverty(American) myself.
I enjoyed the Iowa Caucus because, as a Floridian, it's nice to feel less backward than somewhere else for a change.
My Christian(SoBap) faith wasn't based on any solid arguments at all, but rather on the fact that everyone I knew during my childhood, teens and early 20s believed it so it must be true.  Atheists were described as knowing that god existed but openly mocked him thru their rebellion against "His Word".  My parents did everything in their power to shelter me from any opposing worldview, and discredit the ones they couldn't keep from me.  In the end all it took was an honest look at what I believed to see it was all complete nonsense, and I've never looked back.
Wooooo
Yeah I dunno this sounds like bullshit to me.
I told my paleontology/archaeology nerd girlfriend(now wife) that I didn't believe dinosaurs ever existed.  I was brainwashed by Kent Hovind.  It feels so awesome to be on this side now.
Love how he tries to get the boob pic toward the end.  That takes moxie.
A truly worthy ally for America.   
And I suppose you think you're not an animal?
Agnosticism can also refer to a a view that we cannot know something for sure.  Again I'm atheist because I've never been provided convincing evidence that any god exists, but I fully believe we could never demonstrate that no god of any kind exists.  Therefore, I am an agnostic atheist.\r\rSeriously you picked the wrong sub to come pick a fight based on definitions of terms.
Because if I'm tired of seeing women casually insulted on a daily basis and tired of its continuing normalization in our culture I must be some kind of SJW Feminazi with a stick up my ass, right?
Golf needs tons more of this.

>Why aren't we seeing more activity here for the Greg Cava\n\na lot of special elections going on, we need users to bring them to our attention to see what can be done.  So thank you for bringing it to our attention.\n\nfirst, i'd ask you go here https://political-revolution.com/volunteer/ to get started in our volunteer slack to we can coordinate better.\n\nsecond, probably the most readily apparent reason why this isn't the focus of the democrat party or much else, is because the republicans have a pretty firm grasp on that district as seen by his 67-32 defeat...(i hate that they view things like this personally because that means it should get MORE attention...but whatever)\n\nthird, taking a brief look [he has a volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwkzqwgueOaiowkcbmk8mg3J8VcLapzDU-s2DMqbNmKrFOpw/viewform) to sign up for gotv efforts the weekend of election.  I'd assume they'll have a phone bank, we'll have to reach out and see if we can get in touch on if they want out-of-state help with this.

out-of-state financial support is always helpful because it goes directly to campaign coffers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on volunteer efforts for out-of-state people such as phone banking, do you think its an effective tool?

Hi arturo.  One thing bernie told us was that we all need to be politically active.  I know a lot of us here are interested in making phone calls for you.  How do you feel about outside-of-state help for state elections?
what are you doing to increase activism
and since there isn't a tool to keep track of your calls....i'll assume all 200k of us are calling to make a difference...[because](http://m5.paperblog.com/i/126/1262197/quote-of-the-day-senator-bernie-sanders-L-2Fgn_1.gif)

and really this should be emphasized but i didn't want to start a debate of yaargh we shouldn't just vote blue but our morals.  since it's first to 50% we really can't afford to split our progressive/democrat vote among the other 4 or so candidates, its gotta be a concerted effort and he really does look like a good piece.
It's *Mona Lisa*.
i can start you off by saying http://www.revolutionkit.us/ is a good resource for picking up some apps you may want.\n\n5calls.org might be the app you were thinking of.
I'm in the camp of over discussed.  If the article has some meat to it like say "the dnc's treatment of Bernie Sanders and his supporters was terrible, but here's how we can change it" then I find that acceptable.\n\nHowever if it's \\#neverforget how horrible they treated us,  then that isn't constructive. 
didn't you say you voted for the libertarian? or would have or something...talk about serving the working class...

[Just sayin](http://imgur.com/ivH4kbU)
kivish, you defended a trump supporter because of the context of what was said....i could say the democratic party eats a big pile of shit and are not in it for progressives too, but that helps no one.  How certain are you that you can weed out people who cause division and people who want to help?
>Jon Ossoff's candidate page is conspicuously silent as to where he stood on Bernie in 2016.\n\nthis does not matter.\n\ndo you want a candidate who:\n\n\n    * supports equal wage for equal pay, minimum wage should be a living wage indexed to cost of living.\n\n    * is against actions that undermine americans' access to private communication and strong encryption.\n\n    * will work on reducing incarceration for nonviolent offenders.\n\n    * opposes citizens united\n\nif so, then that is what matters.  If not congratulations, you just awarded georgia a conservative who will blindly follow trumps lead.
Accountability time :)\n\nWhats something you've done "grassrooty" since you've been a mod?\n\nIt can't be "mod".
Thanks I think?
and for real, if you have a question thats holding you back from phonebanking...just ask, i'd rather try to answer a question for someone than have that person not be active.
did you even read the letter from bernie before commenting? he citing more than just possible subversion with the general election.

any plans to ban newslogue?
smfh \n\n>His foreign policy is where he is least progressive\n\n>90th percentile for foreign\n\n>links to more articles by this trash writer.
at least its a text post and not a direct donation link
doesn't fall into the category of progressive
We know the next 2-4 years is going to be hell trying to pass progressive legislation in congress with conservatives holding all 3 branches.  what are your plans to "get stuff done"?  What can we do?
i would call or look at your counties board of elections site to find out
i prefer this one http://ncase.me/ballot/
What are you talking about?
How so? I mean endorsements are just saying something, not doing something.
Hope no one gets questions in advance. \n\nEdit: Beware the pointless semantic battle below.
I'm not doubting there is a lot of bipartisan support for universal healthcare, but just because it's a town hall for a Republican congressperson doesn't mean only Republicans were there. 
>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday forced a nearly party-line 230-188 vote to overturn President Obama’s attempt to safeguard federal funding for family planning clinics, including Planned Parenthood affiliates, allowing them to seamlessly continue serving people with low incomes.\n\nThat's *exactly* what Jesus would do.
A greater percentage of Bernie primary voters (82-85 percent) said they planned to vote for Hillary in 2016 than the percentage of Hillary primary voters who said they planned to vote for Obama in 2008.\n\nStop spreading this myth.  
Yeah what are we, a democracy? America always has been and always will be about giving total power to the right group of chosen elites.
>if we found a way to keep public servants honest... lower pay, enforce conflict of interest rules, full transparency on financial dealings, whatever controls we can come up with as a society... we'd attract fewer narcissists and more people of principle.\n\nhttps://represent.us/ 
>We certainly should question biases coming from reporters but creating these broad sweeping terms to put all journalists in one group and then blame them all every time something bad happens that you don't like is the problem.  \n\nThis could also be said of all of the journalists who were accused of being Putin's puppets by establishment pundits.
How would this work? In our current system it seems impossible for another major left-leaning part to do anything other than just split the vote and ensure Republicans many more wins. 
Exactly. It's a matter of ideology, not "messaging."
What a pointless and absurd argument you have chosen to dig in on.
Are you responding to the right post?  That seemed weirdly non sequitur.
Yeah he certainly has at least 1 personality disorder that itself should be disqualifying for the office. Whether he is actually "insane", ie psychotic or truly detached from reality, is another question. 
That's how we reach them. By calling them retards.
Okay. Well mine is still there.  Do you really think I'm a Trump supporter?  Do you really think *Glenn* is a Trump supporter? Why would he call his administration dangerous?
>The ISSUES are more important now than ever, the issues Bernie Sanders stood against the beltway on time & time again and THAT hasn't changed one bit.\n\nYes, and these issues also still have enormous support from almost all liberals/progressives, and for some issues even a healthy portion of conservatives. There is so much bitterness and hostility in our political discourse right now that that often gets lost. But when we have leaders who speak the truth in an authentic, unifying way, people really aren't as divided on the issues you list as it sometimes seems. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, don't get too discouraged by Democrats who appear to be resentful of progressives. It's mostly superficial white noise and false divisions that have been imposed on us from above, not a true ideological battle arising from within the people (apart from a vocal minority of true believers).  There are real opportunities to rise above that and get to the heart of the matter.         
Another problem is that the Washington Post slandered a litany of legitimate alternative media outlets by implicating them as Kremlin-controlled "fake news" based on the unsubstantiated word of a completely non-credible and anonymous organization (PropOrNot).   It seems very likely that what /u/__add__ said about preserving gatekeeper status is correct.    \n\nIn short - yes, there is such a thing as fake news. The reaction to it was totally inappropriate, misguided and cynical.  
Presumably that demographic would support McCain more than Clinton. But this is besides the point anyways.  All the data I've seen shows that your claim about the prevalence of BoBers is wrong.
I think Claire McCaskill.
Very true. I was accused a few days ago in /r/politics of being "an account that exists for no reason other than to troll left wing subreddits," and of secretly helping to wage "an information and propaganda war instigated by a hostile enemy, and the attacks are coming here every bit as much as they are from our own government. We are UNDER ATTACK and most of the country doesn't even realize it. This is an emergency situation that requires an emergency response."\n\nWhat thought crime did I commit to warrant this response?  I suggested that the corporatization of the news media may have contributed to people's dissatisfaction with it that Trump is taking advantage of.\n\nSo yes. The political discourse is very disturbing. It feels like the kind of atmosphere that precedes war.\n   
>Tell yourself that while many people here are happy about Trump winning \n\nThis is anecdotal evidence and also not consistent with what I've observed, which is that Bernie supporters make up some of the most passionate anti-Trump people.\n\n>Sure. BoBs don't deserve the full brunt of responsibly. But they played a part. Hillary's campaign strat (didn't even go to Wisconsin), Comey's letter, whatever this Russian interference thing was, and being seen as a status quo candidate all added up as well to a larger extent.  \n\n>BoBs doing what they didn't doesn't reflect on all Bernie supporters.   \n\nYour argument was that "many" Bernie supporters voted Stein "to prove a point." Even if I'm being charitable and expanding this to "voting anyone other than Clinton, or not voting," your claim is still false, per all the evidence I've presented, unless you change the word "many" to "few."   \n\nWe were never talking about whether BoBs simply "played a part" at all. You were attempting to generalize. Don't move the goalposts.  
That or the 25th amendment.
>If we split the party we gauruntee the GOP full control for years. \n\nSounds like powerful leverage. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.
>We're not going to conventional or nuclear war.  \n\nThat's not guaranteed.  American military strategists are increasingly discussing how best to go about [limited nuclear war](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/could-america-really-win-limited-nuclear-war-19503). Combine that with our massive [military build-up surrounding Russia's borders](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1033243.shtml) and top it all of with a commander in chief with absurdly terrible diplomacy skills.\n\n[A little more](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/26/worried-about-nato-here-are-three-things-to-watch/) on our buildup on the border of Russia, which hasn't been covered nearly enough:\n\n>In response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the Obama administration unveiled several programs to reassure our European allies and partners. In June 2014, the White House asked Congress for up to $1 billion to fund the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), a measure to bolster support for NATO allies.\n\n>Originally intended as a one-year emergency response measure, **ERI got a fourfold increase in funding for FY2017** (which runs from October 1, 2016, until September 30, 2017). \n\n>The Obama White House also laid the groundwork for a military buildup in Eastern Europe... At the July 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, leaders announced the formation of four multinational battalions to be stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland beginning in early 2017. Elements belonging to the four multinational battalions have already begun deploying – **the biggest NATO buildup in Europe since the 1980s.**\n\n>National rotations are expected to last between six to nine months on a staggered basis, to ensure a continued presence. In Estonia, 800 British troops will be joined later this year by several hundred more from France and Denmark. The United Kingdom and Romania are also contributing to the U.S.-led battalion stationed in Poland. Canada and Germany will lead the remaining two multinational battalions in Latvia and Lithuania, with additional troops coming from Albania, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg, Norway and the Netherlands.\n\n>The U.S. 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division based out of Fort Carson, Colo., began arriving in Poland earlier this month. The Obama administration intended the U.S. deployment “to be **a continual, year-round presence of an armored brigade in Europe.”**\n\nIn spite of Trump's apparent affinity for Putin, the people who will be making decisions on his behalf (ie Tillerson & Mattis) overwhelmingly agree with these measures. \n\nI am not saying none of this is warranted, because I'm honestly not that informed on the issue, but it seems incredibly dangerous and like something the American public should at least know about. This is essentially equivalent to Russia and its allies spending $3-4 billion to militarize the Mexican-American border. It's incredibly provocative and most of have no idea what's happening or why.               
Because he listens and is a progressive who gets things done.  And big tent.
Prefers to focus on policy? Talks about numbers a lot? Sounds like another populist I know...   
Am I missing something? What is the connection to Otpor? 
This part is very telling.\n\n>The leftish leanings of Trump’s staff underscores how blurred the lines between Democrats and Republicans have become when it comes to economic policy.
The point is that he would've won and that your argument about him losing the primaries suggests you haven't thought very deeply about the different voter motivations and different categories of voters in primaries vs general elections. I'm not going to discuss this further because you are kind of a troll and I'm not interested in being repeatedly straw-manned, but think about this if you want to present a stronger argument in the future. 
Something that has been missing from this conversation is, when should words be considered actions? Milo wasn't just "presenting controversial views." He outed a transgender student at one show, and was planning to out undocumented students at the one that was cancelled. That's not a "viewpoint," it's an action that hurts people.  I don't believe anyone is really an absolutist, to be honest.  Would you want a convicted rapist to be allowed to come on a campus and teach students how to get away with date rape? Would you allow someone to come and tell students to murder one another, or teach them how to build a bomb? Those are words too.  The reason they wouldn't be allowed is because they are likely to have harmful consequences.
What is their position? And why? And why is this such a crucial issue when compared to things that DNC chair actually has a say in? 
>Beyond conventional warfare, US think tank strategists are discussing what it would take to “win” a nuclear war. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) recently put out a 140-page report, “Preserving the Balance: A US Eurasia Defense Strategy,” which discusses this issue in detail. The CSBA is headed by Andrew Krepinevich, the report’s author, and includes on its Board of Directors figures such as former Under Secretary of the Army Nelson Ford, former CIA Director James Woolsey and retired general Jack Keane.\n\n>“There is a need to rethink the problem of limited nuclear war in which the United States is a direct participant, or between other parties where the United States has a major security interest,” Krepinevich writes. “As opposed to the global apocalypse envisioned in the wake of a superpower nuclear exchange during the Cold War, there will very likely be a functioning world after a war between minor nuclear powers, or even between the United States and a nuclear-armed Iran or North Korea. US forces must, therefore, be prepared to respond to a range of strategic warfare contingencies along the Eurasian periphery.”\n\n>In an earlier report entitled “Rethinking Armageddon,” Krepinevich argued that the use of a “small number” of battlefield nuclear weapons should be included among the appropriate responses by a US president to conventional threats from Russia.\n\n>During the Cold War, the “limited” use of nuclear weapons was seen as an invitation for a full-scale nuclear exchange and the destruction of the planet. Now such discussions are considered “respectable” and prudent.\n\n\n\nDisgusting. Terrifying.\n\nCan we have a preemptive march against war with Russia/Iran/China? Before it's too late? It seems blindingly obvious we are heading in that direction and we hear so little about it from the media and even activists.     
Keep acting like you don't know the difference between primaries and general elections. It becomes more convincing every time it's repeated.
>I'm not saying that as an endorsement of the strategy -- I'm saying that as purely observation of the reality of the situation. This isn't something you can argue away on the internet, or manipulate to change in the media. Progressives grow in number with every new voter, grow more emboldened about progressive issues with every day.\n\nCrucial point.  Pointing out that Ellison is the unity candidate and Perez is the division candidate is simply a description of reality.  When reactionaries blame the messenger for communicating that fact they are missing the point. It's true and will continue to be true regardless of whether or not we argue about it on Reddit.  
I agree with that. I always support candidates running with no real shot just to refocus the conversation. I just don't think we should be turning against Ellison.
We can go back on forth about who "started it." There is strong evidence that the US was instrumental in regime change in Ukraine (ie state department officials discussing who to replace the president with before the coup happened), possibly due to Ukraine backing out of a trade deal with our allies and entering into one with Russia. That can certainly be seen as an initial act of provocation on our part (overthrowing a Russia-friendly regime on their border and replacing it with a Western-friendly regime). And I think the American public should know we are spending over $3 billion to militarize Russia's border in response to them annexing part of a country most of us know nothing about. It's hard to say that that's not aggressive.  \n\nEdit: I don't know what's going on with this comment thread or if I responded to the right person. It looks all kinds of wonky.
That's a bigger problem IMO than whether the chair supports open primaries.
>If these folks were Canadians, British, folks, you'd have no problem deporting them.  \n\nWhat are you basing that completely false assertion on?
The important thing here is the precedent that this sets. It's hard for people to generalize what's happening to situations outside of the immediate context, but it's important to do so.\n\nConsider this stand out quote:\n\n>One of the main priorities of the CIA for the last five years has been a proxy war in Syria, designed to achieve regime change with the Assad regime. Hillary Clinton was not only for that, she was critical of Obama for not allowing it to go further, and wanted to impose a no-fly zone in Syria and confront the Russians. Donald Trump took exactly the opposite view. He said we shouldn’t care who rules Syria; we should allow the Russians, and even help the Russians, kill ISIS and al-Qaeda and other people in Syria. So, Trump’s agenda that he ran on was completely antithetical to what the CIA wanted.\n\nGlenn is saying that the reason Trump is being subverted by the deep state is not because he's actually a threat to national security, but because he wouldn't authorize something they wanted to do. I don't know whether that's accurate, but for the sake of argument let's say it is.  \n\nI hope everyone can see how that is profoundly undemocratic.  I keep returning to this thought experiment - imagine if Bernie Sanders had been elected president. Based on his history of speaking out against things the intelligence community has wanted, I think there is a chance that he also would be resisting some things that they wanted to do.  They would almost definitely go after Sanders in the way that they are now going after Trump, and based on the primaries, I imagine the press would be happy to oblige their anonymous sources by being their mouthpieces. And we would be very disheartened to see our fellow citizens uncritically believe whatever "Sanders-Russia" narrative that agents chose to plant directly in the Washington Post.\n\nWhether or not Trump has pure or noble motives for refusing to confront Russia is irrelevant to this point - allowing these agencies to deligitimize the president for not going along with their plan is dangerous.  I'm **not** saying this is a reason not to pursue the Trump-Russia connection. I think there is likely something sketchy/illegal going on, but that doesn't seem to be the real basis for the IC's actions. Does it make sense to deligitimize the president because of what we speculate without evidence to be the cause of his affinity for Russia? Because I personally could think of a few reasons other than "blackmail."\n\nAlso, from a strategic political perspective, imagine how this galvanizes and alienates Trump supporters and divides the country even further.  I know it's hard for people to believe since Trump seems like such a self-evident sociopathic fraud, but it's important to know that for a lot of people, he is "their guy" in the same way a lot of us see Sanders as being "our guy.". They see him as being attacked by the establishment in the same way that we saw Sanders as being attacked by the establishment.  Imagine how you would see an attempt to undermine Sanders after he had already "beaten the odds" and ascended to the presidency.  Might that be a recipe for making people even angrier, even more resentful of the establishment, and even more susceptible to scapegoating and authoritarianism?             
Okay, we also shouldn't be placing all journalists **who express skepticism** in one group and label them Putin agents. And yes, that was happening. 
They also have nukes. I don't like the odds.
Her platform calls for:\n\n>Supporting a living wage for all Americans and Equal Pay for women and minorities; Expanding Medicaid and reducing the costs for prescription drugs; Fully funding public education and improving the quality of public schools; Fair Policing and Criminal Justice Reform; Eliminating the school to prison pipeline; Tax relief for blue collar workers and small businesses; Eliminating loopholes for corporate tax breaks; Reversing the damage done by Citizens United; Grassroots funding for political campaigns; Stabilizing Social Security for future generations; Mental Health reform aimed at reducing gun violence; Supporting veterans transitioning from deployment to the workforce.
I don't feel like watching this. Can someone tell me if this is legitimate or just trolling/fear-mongering?
The belief is now pretty widespread among the general left-leaning population. We are being manipulated into a second cold war.
You know what would be a good compromise? Having closed primaries but having the deadline to register closer to the date of the vote. It's insane how many people weren't allowed to vote in the primaries because they didn't register several months in advance.\n\nAlthough there are many states with open primaries already, including mine, and I don't know whether it's really wrought havoc. Sort of seems like a non-issue a la voter fraud. 
Anthony Atamanuik I believe. From the Trump vs Bernie debates.
So? We're not talking about 3rd party support. In 2008 Clinton supporters crossed over to McCain, not 3rd party. I don't know what the story was in 2012. But all of that is a less direct indicator of support than asking people "who will you support" or "who did you support."
How does one start an AM talk radio show? What's stopping someone from starting an angry, firebrand, anti-establishment show that speaks to rural economic anxieties but from a leftist perspective?
I believe it's on ballotpedia. This is compounded by the fact that during his AMA he appeared to have no real understanding of what he was talking about, and repeatedly falsely claimed he was the "only" candidate talking about certain issues.  He also responds with hostility to criticism and has poor spelling and grammar.\n\nThough all that said, if he is in fact going to be there, I'm glad he will be up there forcing the candidates to talk publicly about difficult things.   
I dunno. I still like Keith, because of his ideas, the actions he wants to take, the way he communicates, and the way he treats people. I think a lot of people here feel that way.
\nTheir motivations sound reasonable.\n\n>Democratic officials in Republican-dominated Washington view the entire subject as a trap, a premature discussion that could backfire in spectacular fashion by making the party appear too overzealous in its opposition to Trump. Worse, they fear, it could harden Republican support for the president by handing his party significant fundraising and political ammunition when the chances of success for an early impeachment push are remote, at best. \n\nImpeachment requires 2/3 of the senate. It's not going to happen until a larger portion of the population wants it. That's not impossible *ever*, but it's impossible now.
Those states plus the states endorsing Keith only add up to 28...
How isn't he? What moral justification can there possibly be for the things he wants to do?  "Freedom to fail" >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> compassion, kindness, health, safety, fairness, or literally any other moral principle you could possibly think of?
This is my question as well. If none of the candidates are supporting this, then I guess the DNC doesn't really have a choice, do they? I mean what exactly are we talking about?\n\nI'd also like to see the evidence that Keith, or any of the other candidates for that matter, have actually expressed opposition to electoral reform. \n\nIt's also laughable to imply that this issue alone is what was wrong with DWS. 
He seems excruciatingly uncomfortable even appearing on camera.
I think that's kind of the point.
By being active and producing high quality discussion and content.
BBC actually has a good one called The Documentary! I have a feeling you'd like it.
Good interview, and pretty well argued. The only thing I am not sure about is his claim about the potential popular support that would exist for this. The idea that we have to "unite, not divide" is pretty prevalent right now even among people who share these values (ie the majority of Democrats), and many leaders in the party have cynically taken advantage of this "unifying" anti-Trump sentiment now that he is president, just as they did during the election. But if Ellison isn't elected chair I personally would be open to this.  Or even if, like the interviewee says, Ellison is elected and then does a complete 180 on everything that makes him good.    
But who cares what they think, right? Good leadership is about being in perpetual conflict with the entire organization you are leading.
Barber is an incredible person. We are very lucky to have him in NC. 
Yes, this is a major part of what I was saying. I'm not sure how that got twisted into me being a sinister disinformation agent by /u/jbwmac. I'd also add that I think many people feel a disconnect with the media not just because they *lie*, but because of the things they just *don't cover*. I think there's a sense that something is fundamentally broken and decaying in our society, and the media (specifically television media) are incentivized not to cover the reasons in any substantive way.  Presumably several decades ago, human nature was the same as it is now, and yet people at that time consumed media that was much less partisan and better at keeping them informed on important issues.\n\nI remember right after the election, top posts throughout /r/politics were literally blaming the media for Trump winning. Hating the media was cool, and people acted like they hoped CNN would go bankrupt.  At that time I remember repeatedly warning people that, even though the media is flawed and in need of reform, we need them now more than ever, as Trump **will** be attacking freedom of the press and we shouldn't be enabling that. But apparently now, 2 months later, that is too nuanced of a message. You either defend the media thoughtlessly and pretend they are wholly blameless, or you are a Kremlin stooge.  \n\nI think that's an alarming trend. What will it be like 2 more months from now?    /u/jbwmac, how do you plan to contribute to the continued decline in the quality of political discourse? I'd like a heads up.   
Who knows where towed cars go? One of the great mysteries of nature.
So two people. Also, the Washington Times is a right-wing paper published by a cult. I don't think we need to be too alarmed. Their skew is obvious - the activists who interrupted Perez didn't in reality say anything about Ellison.
This Is Hell\n\nBelabored by Dissent Magazine\n\nThe Ralph Nader Radio Hour\n\nIntercepted\n\nCongressional Dish\n\nWhoWhatWhy\n\n\nFavorites from NPR are On The Media and The Brian Lehrer Show. Although they're not strictly progressive, I find them often to be lone voices of reason.   
I already said that.
One solution that avoids the need for heavy-handed regulation is making the airwaves public, and codifying into law that they will always receive a certain budget. This removes any structural incentives for media outlets to distort reality for certain agendas, because there would be no strings attached to their funding.\n\nI believe this was the case for television news a few decades ago.  
There are a few names I see over and over again who derail just about every thread that they can. The best thing to do is to call them out by name when you see them, particularly when you see someone getting dragged into an argument with them.  I don't know whether they are paid, or just bizarrely passionate about hating progressivism.  
But it's not Russia's job to respond when we overthrow a regime on their border that's friendly to them and replace it with an unfriendly regime?   That seems unrealistic. It's hard to pretend we follow some kind of high-minded moral principles when we are overthrowing democratically elected governments.\n\nI'm not saying they were right to annex Crimea. But we aren't at all blameless and continuing to provoke Russia and blame them for everything is dangerous.\n\nI don't know what a BCT is. According to the articles this is the largest NATO buildup since the 1980s. 
Sleeping next to u/Damn_DirtyApe as he stays up on Reddit all night\n\n-my girlfriend
Trump himself called it a Muslim ban thank you very much. It actually was a huge deal for the countries involved. Iraq even considered revoking US troop access.
I am conflicted about this. What do these activists mean when they say "resist Trump's agenda"? Do they mean never voting for *any* of his nominees and refusing to ever entertain the possibility of working with him on *anything*?  \n\nI agree with primarying incumbents who support the worst of Trump's appointees and fail to speak out against the administration's actions, and who just lie down when they should be as oppositional as possible (ie, the confirmation of Jeff Sessions). \n\nBut I think the entire party could benefit from Sanders' approach of voting only for the nominees who are acceptable and speaking out loudly against the rest. Likewise, calling Trump's bluff by promising to work with him on things that help the American people (knowing full well he is a con artist and won't do those things), and speak out loudly against the administration's actual actions.\n\nIn other words these activists would be more compelling if they were more specific.  Speaking against ideas and actions is more persuasive than speaking against a person.  
>Not on election day. In 2008, either Clinton voters ended up going Obama or didn't vote at all. McCain got 10% of Dems which is the same numbers that Romney and Trump got. \n\nYes, [on election day](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-were-those-clinton-mccain-crossover-voters/).\n\n>16 percent of McCain voters said they would have voted for Clinton, the Democrat, if she had been her party's nominee. \n\nIf you're saying that's "normal" crossover, I don't disagree with you. The same can be said for Sanders-notClinton crossover.\n\n>PUMAs were a non-factor post August. Obama got 69 million votes and Nader got like half of a percent. My claim was that BoBs voted Stein or didn't bother to show up at all. Not that they voted Trump. \n\nYour claim is wrong based on all the evidence I just presented to you.
That was an absolutely brilliant response. The guy is very quick witted.
Can't find the poll right now but in October or November it was 82%. Higher than the percentage of non-Trump supporting Republicans planning to vote Trump.\n\nYes, it is a false narrative. Your gish gallop of mostly irrelevant data doesn't change that. \n\nEdit: [here](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/beneath-close-election-contest-lie-deep-rifts-groups/story?id=43253122)   \n\nEdit 2: And after the convention in the end of August 2008, [81%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/109957/obama-gains-among-former-clinton-supporters.aspx) of Hillary supporters said they planned to vote for Obama.\n\nAnd [moreover](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-were-those-clinton-mccain-crossover-voters/), from exit polls:\n\n>While 85% of Obama voters said they would have voted for Clinton had she been the Democratic candidate, 13% would not have supported her including 6% who said they would have backed McCain and 7% who said they would not have voted.\n\nSo all of this suggests the amount of support for Hillary by Bernie supporters was basically in the normal range. Which is actually pretty remarkable loyalty considering the circumstances. \n\nCan you stop lying now?    
He's always been one of the most progressive members of Congress.
>Proof of us "overthrowing" the "regime" in Ukraine? \n\n[This](http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/05/chronology-of-the-ukrainian-coup/) is a pretty thorough write-up.\n\n>We don't have "high-minded" moral principles. We do what is in the interest of our country and what is in the interest of our national security.\n\nI don't see how risking nuclear war is in the interest of the American population.\n\n>Also which is it, a democratically elected government or a regime? \n\nRegime change just means "the replacement of one administration or government by another, especially by means of military force."\n\n>A BCT is a brigade combat team. The one in Poland is from the 4th infantry division and is an armored brigade combat team. Again, don't know what the significance of it being the "largest NATO buildup since the 1980s" because it still doesn't make a difference.\n \nHow does it not make a difference that we are entering into a new cold war?\n   
https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/125395/well-donate-to-the-dnc-if-keith-ellison-becomes-chairman\n\nIn case anyone else is interested. It's at ~~$28,122~~ $28,159 out of a $30,000 goal.   
What one must never do is learn, understand, or reform. To do so is treason. \n\nThat line of thinking is the problem.
No, I'm saying I don't trust CNN for that exact reason. I'm not sure how you got that from my post.
Don't worry though- from what I understand, Sam has zero votes, and anyways you need a majority of votes to be elected chair. This means there will be multiple rounds, with people being eliminated each time. So I don't think there's any danger of the vote being split.
Agreed completely.  It's frustrating how vigorous and well-organized activists are in basically wasting their time on this.  It drives me totally insane how much energy is directed by the American population into the wrong things. Why don't we see this kind of outcry against political corruption, illegal wars, unchecked government power, and economic exploitation? People always respond that you can focus on both Trump being bad **and** these other issues, but the reality is that we don't.   
The vice chair in North Carolina was a former Bernie staffer, for whatever that's worth.
Because knowing how other people are going to vote is different than knowing the opinions of people who don't get a vote.
They do both. Go away.
I look at this story in the context of the [35 page dossier](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html) published last year. Everything in it continues to verify. I think more explosive news is coming as the IC tries to build a case. That's why Trump has been so busy now trying to delegitimize the media. They're trying to get ahead of it.
>If an administration is being corrupt or is doing things behind the scenes that it shouldn't be doing, shouldn't leaks be encouraged?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n>Wasn't everyone here angry that Obama persecuted leakers? Wasn't everyone here happy with Wikileaks during the election?\n\n>Why the sudden change of tune when it's hurting Trump now, in a subreddit supporting Bernie Sanders?  \n\nI'm not upset about the leaks. The point is that we should be vigilant about what the FBI and CIA are doing and remember that they're unelected, unaccountable, and have a history of being deeply irresponsible and anti-democratic.   \n\n  The problem is there are two competing dangerous power centers working in opposition here - the Trump administration and his opponents in intelligence agencies.  Neither are on our side.
> notice how legislation that benefits the military industrial complex pretty much always gets through? 🤔\n\nIn spite of often being disliked by bipartisan majorities. If Democrats really wanted to win they would campaign against destructive and wasteful military interventionism. This presents a major opportunity for the Justice Democrats.
From the article:\n\n>Ellison, a frontrunner in the race along with former Labor Sec. Tom Perez, is expected to give Buckley, who is running for reelection as the chairman of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, his ear on state party operations if Ellison wins next Saturday's election.\n\n>"When we have a successful outcome in Atlanta next week, I have asked him to lead our effort to provide the support and resources the state parties need in a new and innovative 57 state strategy," Ellison said in a statement.\n\n
**Human civilization 
According to the article, up to 4,000,000,000. \n\n>More contemporary studies have shown similarly disastrous outcomes. A 2007 report by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War suggested that a “limited” nuclear exchange could lead to the deaths of over a billion people, mostly as a result of widespread climate disruption. The US National Academy of Sciences concluded that a “large-scale nuclear war” would lead directly to the deaths of up to four billion people.
No, but if you want to argue with something that I didn't say, I can't stop you. Have fun.
I was kidding. That's what I predict his response would be: something with zero substance.
It's an unfortunate reality. But these are the only people who've shown a likelihood of changing it.
Disclaimer? I meant there's hopefully a good chance she will vote for Keith, even though apparently no one in our state party has made public endorsements yet. \n\nBut yes, it's definitely a good thing. From what I understand there was a major infusion of progressives into our state DNC.  
Thank you for explaining, I wasn't aware of that.
Also note that 82℅ of Sanders primary voters said they would vote for Hillary in the general. This is higher than the percentage of non-Trump Republican primary voters who said they would vote for Trump in the general. So the argument is condescending *and* unfounded. 
This is ridiculous. Good people do shitty things sometimes. That shouldn't be that much of a surprise. I'm not saying he is or isn't a "real progressive" - I honestly don't even know his voting record. But to act like his entire life's work is overshadowed by one regrettable decision is wrong.     
6.Nominating less disliked candidates. \n\nNot saying that's the only thing. All of your points are good too. Just adding to your list.       
Endorsements are by definition lip service. Schumer doesn't vote on chair.
I have to wonder... I think what Trump is saying is despicable, but, could this have been avoided if the media had actually told us the truth consistently, instead of consistently and transparently trying to manipulate us for several decades? Is it a coincidence that decline in faith in the media went along with increasing corporatization and partisanship of the press? It's so sad. I feel like this all could have been avoided. And now we get this fucker who is able to point out the accurate fact that, sometimes, the media kind of sucks, and this feels true enough to many Americans that he can use it to deligitimize all criticism of him in the eyes of his supporters.          \n\nEdit: What the hell, /u/jbwmac?\n\n>EDIT: Replied to this comment is an assertion by an account that exists for no reason other than to troll left wing subreddits.\n\nWhy don't you check my post history? Not everyone has the same perspective as you. I have trouble understanding this puritanical, hateful dogmatism. Are you unable to tolerate ever feeling doubt or ambivalence? You are the problem then. People like you have gotten us where we are.\n\n>We are in the midst of an information and propaganda war instigated by a hostile enemy, and the attacks are coming here every bit as much as they are from our own government. We are UNDER ATTACK and most of the country doesn't even realize it.

That is despicable and you should be ashamed of yourself.  You are actively making the world a worse place.  How do you respond? By being a coward and making another edit to attack me without accountability? 
Amen. I'm actually Hispanic and sick of all the identity politics and pandering. Establishment dems think they can stay in bed with Wall Street/big banks/Walmart/etc and just throw out the race/gender/sexual identity card every four years.

I heard he wrote a paper in college on Bernie so I just searched for a story about it to link to you as a reply....  but, it turns out he wrote the paper in high school (in 2000) and the whole thing is [available online](https://www.jfklibrary.org/Education/Profile-in-Courage-Essay-Contest/~/media/32A849B1D0E6446B9BCAFCCDF90B2BB8.pdf).\n\n>Sanders’ courage is evident in the first word he uses to describe himself: “Socialist”. In a\ncountry where Communism is still the dirtiest of ideological dirty words, in a climate where even\nliberalism is considered radical, and Socialism is immediately and perhaps willfully confused\nwith Communism, a politician dares to call himself a socialist? He does indeed. Here is\nsomeone who has “looked into his own soul” and expressed an ideology, the endorsement of\nwhich, in today’s political atmosphere, is analogous to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Even\nthough he has lived through a time in which an admitted socialist could not act in a film, let\nalone hold a Congressional seat, Sanders is not afraid to be candid about his political persuasion. 
Hey thanks man! I would never have flipped this on. 
A TL,DR of the article: surveying ALL ADULTS instead of REGISTERED VOTERS yields lower approval for Trump. Citing the "all adults" surveys is more accurate when making historical comparisons, but RVs and LVs is more useful/predictive for elections.\n\nIt underscores the importance of voter registration, motivation, and turnout. Something Bernie tweeted about recently. Democrats left tons of votes on the shelf last November, as this community knows.
The stay was already denied.
We need to organize locally and register voters. The same groups that are organizing anti-Trump marches and such should also be registering voters now. We should have a goal for next year's midterms of at least matching last November's presidential election year turnout. That would be enough to win a majority in the House and then some.
*May* face a primary? She's even more out to lunch than we thought.
I see what you're saying and I agree. But Bannon is in charge and he did let go of the leash yesterday for a reason. Bannon does have a plan.
So you're saying it was a different Michael Cohen who secretly met with Russian intelligence officials on behalf of Trump? Ok.
Yeah, he was having an amazing season until that thing happened. That thing...  I don't feel he ever played the same again.

I don't think unconditional unification is acceptable. But I do think Hillary voters, and even Trump voters are there for the taking for us.

They'll say this was a draft and they never intended to do this. Notice the date of the memo. This was back when he still thought he was king.

We're not gonna go 41-Okaro in the second half of the season. It's gonna have to happen at some point. The Nets match up with us well. \n\nBut I'm seeing that this team REALLY cares about continuing this streak and winning. There has been no lack of effort in these games that you would see with a team like the 2012-2013 Heat.

39% is pretty low. Bush's popularity dipped below that only because his base thought he wasn't being strong enough on immigration and Iraq turned into a mess. I'd say 35% is about as low as the support goes. What we need to do is make sure the 60 to 65% of us who disapprove do so loudly and visibly, amplify it when moderate Republicans speak out. The Republicans in Congress need to see and feel the wave that's gonna wash them away next November if they don't impeach him.
So your position is that Saudi Arabia is not considered a place that sponsors terrorism by the USA because they are, in fact, NOT a sponsor of terrorism?

Actually I don't know that we differ much. I think when I say Hillary voters, I really just mean people like my friend's dad, who I was speaking with earlier today. A lifelong democrat blue collar guy in his 60s...  a "yeah universal health care would be great but it's not realistic cuz we have more people than Denmark here" and blah blah blah type of guy. I feel like by the end of the long argument, in which I mainly said that our negotiating position should have begun in 2009 with a Medicare for all universal health care bill, and not with Obama's watered down giveaway to the insurance companies, and that yeah Bernie isn't gonna get everything he wants through congress...  but shouldn't his proposals be our starting point for negotiations instead of the centrist crap? I feel like he was finally getting what I was saying and breaking the narrative Clinton/Brock/etc have been pushing for the last few years. That's the guy I wanna convince. Not DWS, who is my congresswoman btw. The actual establishment dems who are brainwashing guys like that. That's who I wanna fight and get rid of. But we have to get off Reddit and talk to people you know? So many Clinton people I've talked to after the election have told me we were right about Bernie. Average normal people...  but you do make a good point about timing. Now is the time to TAKE the party from them. Not next year.
I'm in my late 30s. I was definitely a late bloomer too. At least you've had the courage to ask girls out at your age. I just started getting ballsier later in life, and trust me, it's the way to go. Screw it if that one girl doesn't like you. Or the next. There are always more. Things change. I've been with a lot of women later in life, not that this should define your happiness. It's also come with a lot of misery and heartbreak. Things go up and down and it'll continue to be that way always.\n \nThe good news for a guy is things really do get better with age. You will get experience. Your looks will improve. There's a long time between now and when you're 60, and technology is changing medicine all the time. Also, you're only very slightly shorter than the average. \n\nI'm glad you're sharing. We're listening.\n
Top team in r/NBA, baby. You other weak ass subs will never rival the greatness of the magnitude of the Miami Heat. Miami all day you under 10,000 weakling subs who wanna talk shit bla bla bla i'm tired now.
This is actually a [post](http://www.officiallytrumped.com/labor-secretary-nominee-gave-sweetheart-deal-child-rape-charges-trumps-miami-billionaire-buddy/) I wrote on my site. It's heavily sourced and easier to read with links there, but I don't know if it's frowned upon to link to your own thing. \n\nAcosta is the Dean of my alma mater's law school :(\n\n
You may or may not be right. We are doing a lot of assuming here. Either way, all the stats I mentioned are from this year, so even if he's 42, that's what he would contribute to us right now.
Lol good night man
I made one too with my friend! Officiallytrumped.com, I'm not trying to track him because it's too much. Just analysis and activism. I wrote a [piece](http://www.officiallytrumped.com/fake-news-gets-real/) the other day about what John Oliver talks about here, including a crazy Alex Jones clip and how this propaganda strategy was actually exported from Russia.
He can give them the list or not. If the DNC doesn't elect Keith as chair, doesn't stop taking money from lobbyists, doesn't encourage fresh new candidates and a level playing field in primaries, I'll just unsubscribe from the first e-mail I receive. \n\nIf the status quo continues at the DNC, Our Revolution can sell it to them for millions for all I care and use the money to run primary candidates against them. \n\nThey still will never get a dime from me until they're under new management.
No downvotes. Appreciate the first hand info.
the little negative sign (-) next to each comment's score. \n\nwait, you've been a redditor for 4 years...  
[Someone](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN15X0OE) is working on it. We'll all just have to be patient I guess.\n\nIf I were guilty of doing this and the IC was conducting multiple investigations, a good strategy in the meantime might be to try to de-legitimize the media so that when it's finally reported no one will believe it.
I probably sound like I'm campaigning for the guy. You actually made me do some research here. Here's [his platform for the DNC](https://petefordnc.com/platform/). It's pretty comprehensive. 
[pretty great explanation here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mUP0tx7Ib2w)
The gerrymandered map makes things hard but not impossible. We will need dramatic victories in the next two elections. Something that is going to actually be achievable because of Trump. If we survive the next few years, we have an excellent shot at making fundamental changes like these.
Dude, I appreciate your passion. No need to be defensive. You are probably a little younger than me. You don't need to be offended by me recognizing this. I don't say it condescendingly. I was younger too once. We need passion from you. We need you to fight. Now more than ever. But I'm not your enemy.
They can produce a video of Trump and Putin naked in a bed with 12 hookers urinating on them as they chat about their plans to genetically clone a Stalin DNA to overthrow America, but it is still the decision of spineless Congressional Republicans like Chaffetz, Ryan, and McConnell to investigate, impeach, and remove.
No, but I do think they are a state-sponsor of terrorism because [their government funds ISIS and the U.S. State Department knows about it](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html).
Not necessarily. He attacked the judicial branch publicly. Don't assume Roberts and Kennedy will side with him. Even Gorsuch took exception to his comments.
I think we've all been there at one point or another over the last maddening 12 months or so.
Prince Bandar wasn't just a government official, and KSA is not structured like American government. You're talking like he's an El Paso city councilman. Also, we invaded Iraq on much weaker connections.
I was going for you guys then. Reggie Is probably my favorite non-Heat player of all time. But the championships make me kind of not care about the Knicks. Dallas on the other hand...
Classic case of accidentally speaking the truth, then backpedaling.
So disturbing yet so hilarious. 
[Forgot someone.](http://i52.tinypic.com/fvwn45.jpg)
I'm not trying to be mean or single you out. On the contrary, if this administration is encouraging you to participate for the first time, good.\n\nBut you only have two senators in your state. You could have found this information out through a Google search in the time it took you to type the first four words of your comment. \n\nThe answer though: If your senators are Dem, they voted against her. If they're Republicans not named Lisa Murkoski or Susan Collins, they voted for her. \n\n
I believe it was, "There's no way that toupee is real"
It's not an easy thing to build a case. Even when you know the person' guilty, you need irrefutable proof. I imagine that's what's going on right now.
I'm having trouble figuring out why every one of my comments in this thread that simply offers links to instances of the KSA supporting terrorism is being downvoted.\n\nI understand why the U.S. doesn't designate them as terrorists. They're strategic allies. But you guys are doing some interesting mental gymnastics to defend who? The Saudi Royals? Islam? Hillary? Obama? Prince Bandar? W. Bush? Trump? I can't even tell anymore. \n\nTry to move past whatever your narrative is. The KSA is a brutal dictatorship, oppressive of women's rights, and yes a state-sponsor of international terrorism. 
It's a madhouse...  [A MADHOUSE!!!](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/679/586/836.gif)
You're right about dancing around the rules. I guess downvoting is the way to go.
... to be impeached 
The same kind of people who think it was harder to be a white male in Obama's America than a black slave in the 1800s...\n\nI feel so bad for you. Keep your head up buddy. One day conservative white men will rise up and have power in this world.
Did you bother to check the context of that comment? It was clearly sarcasm. You won't meet very many people who are more pro-Bernie than me. I don't wanna be insulting to you because I have a lot of faith in you younger guys n gals but you need to grow up a bit and fast. The people who voted for Clinton aren't our enemies. The Clinton *machine* is. They use those people and all this infighting is great for them and the status quo.\n\n
The most wonderful thing about all this is that their ["fake news" propaganda is powerless here.] (http://www.officiallytrumped.com/flynnsanity/) Trump blinked and there's blood in the water now.
Except for just that one time [the Saudi prince's family helped fund the 9/11 hijackers](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/05/politics/28-pages-saudi-prince-bandar-9-11/).
Absolutely proves it, you're right. There's no way a man taking a trip on behalf of Vladimir Putin and the FSB as part of an international criminal enterprise to interfere in another country's election could possibly get around without using his own passport.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
It's hard to imagine messing with a team that's on a roll like the Heat are on right now.\n\nStill, good luck getting a shot past a Whiteside/Ibaka wall. Shooting 54% from the field, 15 points per game, 1.5 threes per game. Dude is still 27 and I think would fit in well with the Heat's culture. If we can do it without disrupting our core I'd be intrigued. Babbitt is probably our weakest link right now.
What has been the consensus on this sub regarding Mayor Pete? I like him. Even if Keith wins, I would hope he is at least somewhere in the picture. Maybe Vice-Chair? (Tulsi's role before the primaries last year.)\n\nI think he is someone who would be on our side and could be a strong figure for national office in the future.
All held together somehow by a giant douche.
As an old Heat fan, awesome to see Steve Smith on there. I used to try Smith's little head fake thing on the court when I was a kid. Takes me back to the first time we made the playoffs. He was the best player we had until the Timmy/Zo era. 
Urine.
People are finally rising up against Trump. What were you talking about and why are you downvoting me?
The Republicans told me Obama screwed up Iraq.
Because you're a sophisticated organic robot.
The Patriots would have to inflate their footballs with 90° air for the Ideal Gas Law to explain deflategate. That's just as bad as having staff members physically deflate footballs.\n\nSo Bill Nye was technically correct.
If x isn't likely or possible, getting worked up about x makes little sense. I'm more worried about his EPA pick while you're already accusing him of war crimes.\n\nAlso I don't recall calling you melodramatic...
It was on C-SPAN.
That's what I did. Good luck.
Even a crack baby is special.
They're both cooler than you dude.
Elizabeth Warren is consumer protection advocate. Your comparison doesn't make any sense. 
Ugly or bigly?
u/samurai00110 said it best.
Nobody is paying Nye to believe in climate change. That's legit science.
What do you have against C-SPAN? They broadcast directly from Congress most of the time. The rest of the time is filled with lectures and panel discussions with academics and military officers.
Or the government could buy the companies and keep the people employed. That would be a pretty new sort of deal though.
Good habits start now.
Still, that doesn't change what Trump says...
Girl told me she missed her therapy session; never saw such an independent outgoing person become submissive and child-like so fast.\n\nOffered to drive her next week. 
You keep telling yourself that buddy.
You shouldn't be put in charge of that if you didn't meet the family.\n\n~ Captain Obvious
I have a problem with you trying to attach 'value' to human life. If it lives off of life support you legally can't end their life.\n\nNow what's your problem?
That's still insulting and ignores the fakeness of the current POTUS. \n\nThe only thing that can heal this country is honesty and respect and I don't get that vibe from you.
It's neither of our position to judge that. You definitely wouldn't want me judging your value and vice versa.
I don't agree. It's not your call. That's what samurai00110 said.\n\n
Allow me to clarify this issue for you:\n\nA Muslim ban doesn't hinge on what percentage of Muslims in the world it affects. That's ridiculous.\n\nIt hinges on being a test of religion. This was so repugnant that the administration tweaked it affect nationality. *But the countries singled out are Muslim*.\n\nImagine if China wanted a *Christian* ban. Then when people became outraged, they tweaked it to affect people from United States, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain.
A TV movie every year or so would have been cool. As the actors dropped out they could be replaced by new characters. They could duplicate some people's teleporter signatures on Earth. There's so much they could do.
He automated his competitor's wife's job!
If you don't know what you're talking about, don't repeat rumors dude.
*But you can't know that.*
She lost.
If you have noticed Trump is incompetent. An ass-clown perhaps, but super incompetent.
But we have, like, laws man.
You feel entitled to blame people for what other people say?
All you're saying is that it's important to focus on beating Trump in 2020 and to put up the candidate that can best accomplish this feat, correct?
Went there yesterday and it was beautiful. Definitely some mud to watch out for, old shoes would come in handy.\n\nI'm not a directions expert but it seems to be towards the center. We always park by the cabins and head past the teepees. If you follow the creek you'll definitely find it.\n\nThere's a spot at the top of the waterfall, right below an observation deck actually, that's covered in ice and it was really cool. It's not a tall water fall by any means but super fun! 
I wasn't speaking in metaphor. From a materialist point of view your distinctions are meaningless.
Haha yea-wait did you say flamethrower?
Great! Totally worth the drive.
Yah but she could take you.
Sounds like you appointed yourself god. Good for you.
Wow that's ridiculous. Other countries are allowed to have incidents too, obviously. People need to stop treating him like he's psychic.
So you still don't know what a Muslim ban is? It's not the number of people, it's the *criteria* used to ban people.
Did they do it on purpose?
Only if you threaten people. You're not, like, psycho right?
FELLOW HUMAN ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT YOU SLEEP IN A CLOSET? DOES NOT ~~COMPUTE~~ ER COMPREHEND.
Nobody's forcing you...
Magic school bus 
Meanwhile in Nebraska we've got Fischer and Sasse. At least Sasse has principles, Fischer goes with the wind. She defended Trump's pussy comments.\n\nMerkley and Wyden would be awesome.
You're a special kind of stupid:\n\n"Neither President Obama nor the State Department banned or stopped those applications entirely"\n\n
That's still a bizarre division of labor. 
And then there were riots...
I'm just suspicious of your argument because it was also leveraged against Bernie Sanders circa July 2015. They claimed he had no mass appeal.\n\nUltimately people were inspired by what he said. But we'll see.
Can the mods quit deleting EVERYTHING?
I didn't call you melodramatic and it didn't save you time or make sense to include that.
Actually they get a massive return. In return for letting somebody else provide their funding they get to be published. It goes on their resume, bolsters them in their field, which usually is parlayed into a tenured position or work for a large corporation.\n\nEdit: Downvotes for pointing out facts? Y'all retarded. Public research is a great thing, quit acting like it's not.
Uh no they don't.
I'd send Bob Ross back.
Maybe this is good?
Dude you're bizarre. You're badmouthing these people anonymously. You give then free stuff when they don't need it. You let *somebody else* who you don't know pick the people *you don't know*.\n\nThat is the shittiest Christmas story ever. How hard is it to find an actual charity or local food pantry? Every year we load tons of food and toys **to actual needy kids**. \n\nYou're browsing r/political_revolution and you can't even find poor people. Sad!
Came here for this.
I doubt your point ever stands firm.
It's not slave labor but mining corporations are scrimp on safety all the time.
I also find the idea of justifying human life offensive.
Their pizza sucked...
A black Neil Degrasse Tyson?
Platte River state park is epic.
You'd think Trump supporters and detractors could find common ground on at least this.
Well it appeared so good one W.
What's a *mid-term* election?
This title is offensive. We don't own otters nor do we 'deserve' them.
Because we all know being under oath is magic.
Republicans love her almost as much as Eric Holder.
There was six months where they wanted to stop her from running the consumer protection bureau. Then she ran for senate. \n\nWhat do they have on her?\n
There's nothing wrong with TPP. It increases trade and influence. Tired of this isolationist crap.
Finally seen it all can quit reddit in peace.
Punching Harper in the face became such a common occurrence he was actually forced to hire private security - the first Canadian PM to do so.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harper

Not with Clinton that's for damn sure.
Jews can do science? Still better than Hillary.
Nixon would know. He had an enemies list and hated the media. 
I really don't care what you're talking about. If they live outside of life support you can't kill them. 
If the green party isn't on the ballot I don't really care. Both parties are whack.
The Mr Rogers President?
I like our Mayor, he really pushed Measure M and I appreciate that as someone without a car who takes the Blue Line to school everyday 
Los Angeles homies do what's right!
Do I make the NVSE folder in the data folder for New Vegas and then the Plugin folder in it? Also am I supposed to put things into those folders before I install NVAC? Do I leave the NVSE contents in the new vegas data folder or do I put it in the new NVSE folder? \n\nSorry, pls excuse my ignorance
What a dick move, David
South Bay and the Port are pretty underrepresented, It'd be nice to have my neighborhood(Harbor City) painted by you 
Bullshit, there are like 50 buildings to climb up on and shoot the walkers. The bad guys are retarded
Figueroa Street because I always lived at least a block away from it as a child and I enjoy the drive from Carson to Downtown
Uhhh at least San Jose didn't make the playoffs 
Bradley's Olympico against Panama at StubHub Center 
at least we can all take solace over the fact San Jose didn't make the playoffs 
The commentary on ESPN and ESPN Deportes is so dead, it's like they don't have any notes on anybody 
I thought this was a new glorious generation, what the absolute fuck?
the copyright trolls can see me using this? just curious
I want Villarreal and Jamieson to be integrated into the first team. Maybe keep keane but only on a new non DP contact. I'd keep Gio, but our midfield needs a revamp 
Carly Fiorina wasn't even close to getting near the Oval Office and even at a state level you're wrong, Meg Whitman lost the California governor's election
Yikes that was brutal 
There's a second leg too for the 6th place team? Or is it only one game?
After all those years of mediocrity, Toronto finally has the strength to bully the new kid 
Rain Dance is OP, pls nerf it Nintendo 
I doubt he stomped the man on purpose, I wouldn't wish injury if it was the other way around 
excuse my ignorance but what is the residency team and how do they differ from their A team? I know their A team is supposed to be the best possible squad but what's the residency team and how do they compare to the A team?
[his Wikipedia page seems different](http://i.imgur.com/9JuuPGB.jpg)
Why? I thought that he was good in Toronto 
Wow those jerseys look... Mad Decent 
Newt, Palin, Cruz, Christie?? I thought he was trying to drain the ducking swamp not but the deepest entities of it into power 
I know my family shouldn't but they're really angry at white people for making Trump president, like it's a personal attack on us 
I still don't think Seattle are underdogs, they could field a bunch of paraplegics and I'd still wouldn't underestimate them. They've always been a scary team even when they get blown out
So uhhh #WeTheNorth? Drake Care-package incoming 
Wow he was decent for me in Football Manager. Signed him to the Galaxy and after 2 years he transferred to a mid table Portuguese club and became a Canada regular 
I'd rather have more AMC Drama shows than 90 minutes of Talking Dead
I'm about to cry looking at the numbers right now. Clinton or Stein please please. I'm about to be embarrassed of being an American. I'm Hispanic and I truly love this country but seeing this racist fuck top the charts is making me lose faith in a huge chunk of this nation. Do these people really hate us that much? Why is there still a fuck ton of them. It's 2016 stop putting us down for fucks sake you had it since the beginning \n\nYeah I wish it was Bernie but at this point I want anybody but Trump, this man shits on us so much and to have this rich racist dickhead as the face and leader of our country makes me want leave and never come back
Apparently nobody hates Pappa more than my dad, he thought he would be the next Carlos Ruiz or something even bigger in Europe so Guatemala could be thinked of as decent for once but then he came back to MLS to score against the Galaxy and did fuck all in the 2015 Gold Cup. I don't agree with most of what he said but he truly hates when he suits up for Guatemala 
At this point I'd rather have Jamieson and Villarreal play over Keane 
ok dis ignorant 
Bred 1s , Fragment 1s , black ultra boost 
Maybe don't sub out your best player 
I don't really ever get to watch SKC, is Benny usually that big of a hothead?
Ok dis racist 
what's a neo nazi brand? Someone told me my Doc Martens were neo nazi boots and I didn't understand
Pescadito Hat Trick incoming 
Why did they sub out Giovinco, he looked like he still had some gas in the tank
Honestly as much I hate Hilary, not voting her in set us back to be more progressive by years. I felt if we had Hilary in we could still have a piece of Bernie's influence. Now it's for nothing 
There's no Spanish broadcast of this game? Nothing on ESPN/FOX Deportes and Univision 
Are the sounders giving out rain ponchos to the fans?
My dad followed the Galaxy since the beginning, before I was born and I grew up with the Galaxy memorabilia the wall and a game was never missed in my house while we were at home. I'm 18 now and looking back, the team really grew up with me especially since I live right by the Stadium in Carson
I could believe NYCFC being dominated by either of the 3 Canadian teams tbf 
The raccoon gods don't like being made a mockery of 
That is the most glorious thing I ever seen 
Freedom Boner
My dad has been following the Galaxy since they were formed, years before I was born and he still doesn't get how in-league transfers work. Every time he sees a decent MLS player he's like "Giovinco is good, Galaxy should offer a couple million for him" or "We should buy that Dallas defender" or "how much money you think the Galaxy can offer for him"
Uhhh I hope this confidence lets Howard do some god level shit against Mexico. If he doesn't fuck Soccer :(
Who cares if we have money? If all we're doing is wasting it on old benchwarmers then what's the point
We have that in California, no? I remember the 2 finalists for Senator were Democrats 
Why are there fans dressed in white making a huge T Mobile logo in the stands? 
wasn't he the guy who said he regretted being cap-tied to Canada
inb4 Drake tries to coach Toronto FC from the sidelines at their next home game 
There's the Bradley we know best!
OKC had/have an MLS team?
Who could replace Bradley for us in the future? Just curious 
2016 is bullshit
I put the NVSE contents in "common\\fallout new vegas" and left Data alone like the instructions said because it said it wasn't a regular mod. In my data folder there isn't an "NVSE" folder. 
We really wasted that 3rd DP spot on Gerrard, holy fuck we could be overpaying some decent European player in his 20's to sit in our midfield with the amount we pay Gerrard 
I may have not agreed with his methods but I never question his love of our country and the national team. He truly cared about the team and I thank him for his dedication 
Being Guatemalan sucks :(

Leave Bradley in Canada
Seattle has a bigger online presence than us
The real loser here is Vancouver 
Isn't Monaco one of the most successful teams in Ligue 1? Why is the stadium so small and not full
I like Will Johnson for some reason, why did he have to lose, HE DOESNT DESERVE TO SUFFER 
Everyone is blowing out everybody 
That's a goal of the year for fucks sake
It's okay Montreal, you guys still have the coolest accents in Canada 
We look like the most villainous team on earth ffs \n\nMexico has the storyline and motivation to give us a beating especially in our Fortress\n\n
We can't say the obvious shit call was shit because we don't have the authority to do so?
Stop turning everything into a fucking meme, dos a cero will bite us in the ass
I know it looks so cool, I think they're releasing it on PC too, I hope so 
Holy fuck, MLS got fucking Keke Palmer, were definitely Major League now
I don't want to go back the Philippines, we have Trump Jr in power. I have never been so ashamed to be American or Filipino 
Isn't this the stadium where USA played Los Ticos in deep snow?
honestly do you think it will ever go back to being cheap again? $70+ for last generation's RAM is unreasonable imo
Benny hasn't scored a hat trick yet? How disappointing. Jurgen was right not to call him up
Congratulations Seattle, you can finally justify your smug tomfoolery 
I wish we could have a place for all the guys at the Galaxy. It's like a giant family that keeps breaking apart     :(

Yeah yeah I know it's horrible, I wish Bernie was president. Hilary is scum but I'd rather have her than Trump who shits on people with the same color as me every second he gets
ok dis cringe
What do you mean 
The goal look offside to me
That Rojas guy is pretty good, he couldn't find a club in Europe after Stuttgart?
It's okay. As much as I love this band, their merch is pretty subpar. 
One of the better Season Finales in the whole tv franchise imo. Action packed and the pacing was way better than usual, was glued to the screen the whole time
Instead of going to extra time, we should just have Edson the Eagle and Cosmo have a streetfight in the parking lot outside the stadium 
The real loser here is Vancouver 
If we don't beat them back at the Azteca then I'll be disappointed 
wow Bradley even admitted he was too soft, great guy for speaking out against this
He was way old by the time he transferred here. He wasn't 30 or 32. We're overpaying him and wasting a DP spot. He was horrid for Liverpool his final season, we could've put the spot to better use at the time. Im talking Gerrard of course.
Basketball? 
What I found awesome is that he took a character who is genuinely the stereotypical dumb token personality and turned him into something so much more through his emotions and energy. If you want a bad example think of Chris Hemsworth in the new ghostbusters film, he's just such a 2-Dimensional character because of the way he was written. Sure the character of Troy had actual opportunity to show more emotion than his did in the film but it's the portrayal in even the dumbest of jokes in scenes which makes Donald a fantastic fit for the role. I hope he keeps his acting career up because I've been really happy to see him stick to his roots and never abandon acting and comedy

I'll check it out. Thanks for sharing your work man! 
Mix vaporware and the Beatles cause this is dope 
I honestly don't think so, the people who designed them don't really seem like comedy fans
Cheers buddy and nice sunny reference 
What type of writing? Comedy? Drama? Please let me know thank ya 
I'm not sure exactly what number it was but around Harmontown 150-160ish they talk about how Schrab is going to vancouver for several months to work on the Lego movie sequel. I remember Dan mentioning how Rob send him a picture of a lego figure posed like he was taking a poop and during a podcast when Rob gets his phone out for a bit, Dan mentions how his case is a lego case. I just googled it and saw an article from two days ago that says Rob left because of creative differences but a quick google search will fill you in on the full story.
Can we get some pics of the shelter and the hole and maybe even possibly the koi pond if you're feeling like showing off because I'm very intrigued of what the shelter looks like 
Two broke girls
My schools dance committee did but they're oblivious to the anus 
I may be mistaken but I believe he left to Vancouver to work of the sequel to the lego movie. They talked about it on older podcasts 
I like this theory too
Thanks for sharing mate!
No way you use this subreddit. I discovered your music about a week ago and my god you've got some good stuff. Keep the great tunes coming!
I could see it. The heavier Jim and Pam focus in the later seasons could be explained by the producers seeing it as a much more healthy and compelling story than Ryan and Kelly and the way Pam and Jims relationship is more between the lines stuff in the first season due to Pam and Roy could explain why they did not see it helping the show by focusing on Jim and Pams nonexistant relationship.
Hey man I've been a fan of your work for years and really respect the work you've put into the industry. \n\nMy question is what would you suggest to someone who is interesting in writing comedy in today market which is oversaturated to say the least? \n\nThanks for years of laughs dude

Get wes Anderson to make a Netflix exclusive project. He made am ex commercials so I could see it 
That could work if done right, nice idea 
Glad to see Schrab back from vancouver
Like greendale, our school budget is exceptionally low. Hence the moistening flesh coloured poster board
I'm begging you to be gay dean for the school boaaa-oaaarrrd!
Totally thought this was a reply to a comment. I'm using the app so I'm not very smooth with it
Canadian residential school system anyone?

The castles in the sky lyrics are probably just a reference to the song Just the Two of Us. Its referenced in a few other rap songs 
I'm interested is there still space? 
Man this isn't even a lack of knowledge it's a mistake that could be fixed with a google search. This is just some dude trying to cut corners 
I have a few friends who grew up in Scarborough so I know it's a considerably different atmosphere than downtown but even the downtown atmosphere of Toronto at its worst has never made me feel as unnerved as this story, and that's only from me reading it. I can only imagine the thoughts going through your head while it's actually happening 
Im placing my bets in this

I would love the world if that occured\n
Having family and friends in Toronto and visiting the city quite frequently this is a horrifying concept. Glad you made it away from that weirdo though!
I hope the bullies feel a deep sickening guilt. Bullying is bad enough when you bully the kid down the block for having red hair but bullying a fucking cancer survivor on her appearance from having cancer is a disgusting inhumane act. Shame on the bullies.
I forgot about that but nice memory. I can see it being weaved into a plot like that 
It looks like a red ballpoint pen has gently caressed your cats ear lining

I'm on the episode of Harmon town where Erin is on her month long trip to Ireland. Seems like she enjoyed it a lot more than just any vacation spot
Thank you! I'll check them out 
Disgusted and shocked by this attack happening on our home soil. Thoughts and prayers go to the friends and families of the victims as they mourn the loss of their loved ones
Rest in peace to a great man who was dedicated to his team like no other. He fought for this team and we will keep the fight for them alive in spirit

Trust me, universities aren't as caring for my nude acrobatics as you may think 
Yea I agree, the shows humour seems too sophisticated to make constant Trump jabs. Thats a bit ironic for a show where an elderly bald man talks about a young girls "rash on her pussy" but the comedy delivered is definitely too witty for low blow Trump jokes.
It's not so much as a matter of taste as it is fans expecting a dead rising game. This game felt generic and strapped together without the little intricate details that make the series great. Every change from the complete dissociation with the original frank west as a character to the changed gameplay made this game feel like a generic game meant to be played through once and left on the shelf. The beauty of the original Dead Rising was lost and it's a shame too because the map was great, it was only a few small additions that would've made the difference between a great game and this clusterfuck of ADHD appeasing. The removal of the over time mode so Capcom could milk more money out of it is honestly just disappointing to the series and the company. It feels like capcom would prefer to make a quick buck and piss off committed fans rather making an actual fantastic game and retaining the series fan base.

Hey man I'm a senior in high school who's interested in writing cooperatively so let me know if you're still looking 
Forgot what episode it is exactly but pretty sure it's in season 2. There's a montage of how much of a dick Pierce is and the group is all sitting in the cafeteria eating lunch. Pierce reaches towards someones fries and every time he steals one he says "Cacaw" like a bird. Such a stupid little scene but makes me burst out in laughter every time.
