neasy with this sub's treatment of Venezuela?\n\nJust a few months ago we were all praising Venezuela. Then when things fell to shit, we abandoned the whole project, sat back and exclaimed "It was doomed from the start!" \n\nLet's face it: The majority of us are white kids who haven't been to Venezuela in our lives. It was easy for us to look down and praise Chavez, praise the missions, and give our solidarity to the PSUV\n\nAnd now we're doing the same thing. We sit back in our arm chairs and say "Actually, it's not real socialism. It was just a corrupt dictatorship". It's easy to flip positions when you're half a world away.\n\nI think we need to own up to the fact we completely misjudged Venezuela. We didn't study it and we didn't develop links with people involved in the Bolivarian revolution. We still don't know what the fuck is going on. Some people say there is food hoarding, others say its a massive plot by the US government\n\nOf course Venezuela needs real socialism, just like the rest of the world does, but maybe we can be a bit humbler with our treatment of Venezuela's problems? We should acknowledge our mistakes, give our solidarity with the people suffering, and actually study the situation instead of making grandiose claims that don't help anyone. \n\n\n
Especially anything to do with sexual assault, rape, child abduction etc. 40 years ago these things were very hush hush. It was considered a "private family matter" and rarely reported to the police. People think that neighbourhoods are way less safe for kids nowadays, but we've probably improved a lot since the last generation
How did the Americans murder Hugo Chavez?
It sucks because people usually know what's up when you say "I'm just tired." It's become code word for "I'm having personal issues"... which sucks because sometimes I'm having a bad day and I don't want other people to worry about me. Now I have to get creative about it
Yeah, it seems like India has a lot of really cool progressive policies, but its such a large, incredibly diverse country that they can't be enforced. \n\nFor example, a couple years ago I saw an Indian mayor bragging about how high the minimum wage in his city was, and how he was so concerned with the plight of the workers. Then at the bottom of the article, it mentions only 15% of the population works in the formal sector (mostly bureaucrats). The other 85% are street vendors, taxi drivers, middlemen, and shit that live outside of the government regulated economy. The minimum wage hike meant nothing to them. \n
Sweet, I'll look into it 
Same for me. I live in a lovely small university city, awesome history, architecture, culture etc. It's got all the big city amenities while having the vibe of a quaint east coast town. \n\nIf the weather was any warmer, people would flock here like its the new Portland or Seattle. It would drive the rental prices up way too high and the city wouldn't have the same vibe. \n\nSo yeah, I have to deal with frigid weather for about 6 months of the year, but it keeps all the yuppies out. Bittersweet I guess. 
[Jacobin](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/sweden-social-democracy-olaf-palme-assasination-reforms/) did an article on it:\n\n>In 1976 the LO called for the establishment of wage-earner funds. Under the proposal, every year a proportion of a company’s profits — in the form of shares — would be transferred to union-controlled funds. After anywhere from twenty to seventy-five years, workers would control a majority of shares in most companies.\n\n>Palme spent several years killing the proposal’s radical elements. His reaction demonstrated that, for all his reform accomplishments, he was not prepared to step beyond the boundaries of capitalism.\n\nThe LO was the Swedish Trade Union Federation. This bill, called the  [Meidner Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehn%E2%80%93Meidner_model) proposed a gradual transition to worker control over the means of production. Whether that alone constitutes democratic socialism - or a trend towards it - I am not sure. It's the closest a nation has ever come without being viciously attacked or blocked by the CIA
Worth mentioning that *a lot* of indigenous groups in Ecuador hate this guy. He's paid lip service to them, and apparently included "environmental rights" in the country's constitution, but he's also in bed with mining and logging companies big time. No respect for indigenous sovereignty over their land.

Yeah, corruption is huge, and there's a lot of people who are just in it for profit, but still, they are the world's largest producer of renewable energy technology. \n\nI think it just comes down to the fact that in the West we're just waiting around until renewable energy becomes profitable, but fuck, the hand of the free market aint going to speed up just because of climate catastrophe. \n\nMeanwhile, China has the ability to say 'fuck it' and pour massive investments into the sector. Totally, I agree that corruption and self interest are at play, but they really have potential and we don't 
>Lenin tried to implement a system similar to today’s Scandinavian countries - John Bachtell, Chairman, CPUSA\n\nHahahahaha
You're riding high in April
They certainly would if they could 
There's a distinct Clif bar theme in this article. I don't read The Village Voice, but I wonder if they take money from corporate sponsors. 
> Its when you used the term "newsreader" to describe Rachel Barnhart\n\nI don't have a single opinion on the Rochester Mayoral race (nor can I vote in said election), but the use of "newsreader" definitely stuck out like a major red flag for me.  Really seemed off-kilter.
>The government has regularly cracked down on private businesses that flourish and compete with Cuba's chronically inefficient state monopolies.\n\nLet's think about what they mean by inefficient. In financial terms, efficiency is just the amount of labour power put into something vs the profit it generates. They are considered inefficient because they cannot compete with the profit generating abilities of American or European workers.\n\nBut Cuba's planned economy has never been about profit. The point is to produce products according to factors outside of profit - like genuine human need, local environment, and worker satisfaction. Of course if you measure them just based on profit they will not perform well. You can not judge this model using the same yard stick that you would a capitalist American enterprise. \n\nBut again and again, in almost every news article, nationalized industries are described as either "inefficient", "outdated", "unproductive" or a myriad of other unflattering words. The point is to make you think of them as dinosaurs - relegated to a past epoch in history that's far behind the times. We get the impression that they are decaying, the workers sit idle, and nothing is produced. \n\nIn reality, the word 'inefficient' is just a way of measuring capitalist economies that can't even be translated to Cuba's planned model. It's pure ideology. It purposely gives no context behind the facts and distorts our way of looking at Cuba\n
Oh yes, there's a lot of hardship and death that capitalism is allowed to escape blame from\n\n-When businesses fail under capitalism, thousands are left unemployed but nobody is blamed because its the way the system works. IF this happens under proclaimed socialist regimes, its the government's fault that people are unemployed.\n\n-Under planned economies, when there is a shortage of goods, people have to ration or wait in lines. Again, the system is blamed. Under capitalism, there are shortages all the time, but the laws of the free market means the prices just go up, so the poor cannot afford the product and go hungry. Again, the capitalist system is not blamed. \n\n
Cool. Simple, and probably effective. I do understand why you want to limit it to the "committed" user-base. They are the ones who have something at stake, whereas casual users (and brigaders, trolls etc) could really mess things up if they wanted. \n\nThat being said, it would be cool to experiment with more participatory democracy on reddit. r/anarchism is the first I've heard of any sort of elections though  
>A brexit weakens imperialism\n\n...and then what? Are we just going to weaken imperialism for the sake of weakening imperialism? What's the next step after Britain breaks off? What's the strategy we're using? What's the end goal? 
>As Venezuela’s political and economic crisis has worsened in recent years, most regional leaders have been reluctant to criticize Mr. Maduro publicly and Venezuela has managed to maintain significant diplomatic clout, largely by giving neighbors subsidized oil.\n\n>But that is likely to change. Venezuela has been forced to curtail its oil subsidies as it has run out of money\n\nSo Venezuela has won so many allies because it bribes them with oil, eh? Come on - even the most conservative historian or political analyst wouldn't argue that. It's just flat out wrong. I have never heard any public figure or media outlet make that accusation before. I really think they just made it up 
I have a friend who always does this. He's so casual about asking girls out that he's never quite sure if its a date or not. And he's too awkward to make a move or something. The last couple times they didn't call him back and he *still* doesn't know if it was a date or not\n\nLike, I get it if you're awkward, but being vague about your intentions isn't the way to handle it. That will just create more awkwardness down the road. Bite the bullet when you first ask them out and clarify if its a date or not! \n\nGlad this one worked out though! 
> The Government cannot go full Communist, because they are in power in a bourgeois democracy, so they have to pass a bill in order to establish Socialism, one which the opposition would vote against, and it probably wouldn't get enough votes to be passed.\n\nWhy didn't they pass the bill when they controlled the National Assemby then? They used to control the presidency, the parliament and the judiciary
This is why they say war is hell\n\nFuckin' camel spiders man 
I know some humans who legitimately wouldn't be able to figure that out 
This is why I'm jealous of medieval peasants. They never stayed up at night wondering what they were put on this earth for. They knew, because if they didn't get up at 5am to till the fields, their family would starve. Add a healthy dose of religious hierarchy, and a "natural order of things" mentality, and everyone was quite content. \n\nIn the last 150 years, however, we have to find this thing called a 'job' that we define ourselves by. Every time you hand out a resume, you 'sell yourself' to another business for this purpose in life. And for the first time in human history, unemployment is a thing, meaning you don't have a defined role or function. It's a very anxious and unfulfilling set-up. \n\nBut then again, being a peasant probably sucked ass. So maybe its a good trade off. 
Highway blockades aren't obstructing for the sake of obstructing. Their roots lie in the labour movement of the early 20th century. They were used during a general strike to shut down transportation and the delivery of goods. \n\nIt's particularly effective because cities depend on the transportation of materials from outside, and every hour it goes on, the economy loses millions of dollars. If you shut down ports and airports as well, the damage is magnified tenfold. \n\nThe idea isn't to inconvenience people. It's to cause enough economic damage that it forces the government to pay attention to you or come to the bargaining table. \n\n
I've always found that hard to believe. He just saw sparrows eating grain, and personally ordered a massive agricultural campaign that affected all of China? \n\nI mean, even Hitler had tons of eugenic "scientists" giving him justification for why Jews were subhuman. A lot of people believed them because it was just "rational science"\n\nOf course Mao was guilty of innumerable deaths, but I'm willing to bet there were a shit ton of misinformed officials alongside him who share the blame. 
[The Dispossessed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed), by Ursula Leguin is the most detailed blueprint of a communist society I've heard of. But that comes from an anarchist perspective. \n\nIf your friend is more concerned with building socialism, I would suggest looking at how various socialist revolutions were waged in the past. The traditional Marxist-Leninist model believes in the nationalizing of a countries top companies, and the seizure of political power by a vanguard party (The Communist Manifesto itself has a similar transitional scheme). Slowly, companies would be nationalized and a dictatorship of the proletariat would be formed to prevent capitalism from re-emerging. Eventually, the system would spread across the globe, the state withers away etc etc. \n\nThere's a shit ton of regional variants to this. Besides Russia and Cuba, I would suggest looking at the Burkinebe Revolution under Thomas Sankara, the Naxalite Insurgency in India, and the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. \n\nMaoist literature will give you the most comprehensive definition of what to do to build socialism. From what I understand, a protracted people's war basically starts now. You begin as a small revolutionary organization, and directly challenge state power from the get-go. As you gain followers, you educate them with Marxist theory, and keep gaining 'liberated territory' from which you build socialism within. It basically argues that you build socialism, and convince people of its necessity *through* the process of armed struggle. One of the regional variants I find really interesting is in some Canadian Maoist circles, in which they begin the revolutionary struggle by first liberating first nations territory, challenging the Canadian government head-on, and moving in from there. 
Hi there, thanks for doing this! \n\nI'm a Development Studies student in Canada, and I think what you're doing is really cool. For me, development is ideal when both sides are sharing knowledge as equal partners, instead of it being one-sided. So here's my question: \n\nWhat's the most important thing that Canadians can learn from Ghana? ie. Is there something that makes you say "Wow, I wish we had this is Canada!"? This could relate to the program, or just the country in general. \n\nThanks! 
We have a tendency to think animals are more like humans than they are. Cats aren't capable of complex thought. They can't contemplate their own captivity. They can't look back at what 'might have been'. They just exist for the present: Food, water, shelter, bonding and amusement. \n\nYou can wonder what a cat would be like in a more 'natural' environment but domesticated cats aren't really natural to begin with, so its kind of useless. \n\nJust give them good food, a warm bed, and plenty of cuddles. If they are happy in the moment then that's the best you can do. \n
One of the French [Presidential candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/29/french-socialists-leftwing-rebel-benoit-hamon-elysee-manuel-valls-francois-hollande-presidency) is running on a platform that includes taxing robots. The future is now! 
I wonder if he's actually smart enough to know he's driving it, or if he just gets stuck bumping into a wall for 4 hours. 
How is Corbyn better than Bernie? Corbyn claims he's a real socialist, but I don't think he's running a socialist platform
Has Nova Scotia been cut off from their line of credit? Is the province unable to pay its employees, or service its loans? No? Because that is what "dead broke" means, and our government isn't close to it. \n\nI'm sick of the whole "Nova Scotia is broke" narrative, because its vague, unhelpful, and always used by some party to justify bad policies. \n\nOpportunist politicians make our situation out to be a binary: we either crack down on these teachers or we go broke. But do you realize how much other wasteful shit the government spends its money on? They have *consciously* made the decision to go after teachers. Don't let anyone convince you this is the way it *has to be*
Or you could just save 30 mins on election day and not vote. You're not weird if you don't like any of the parties to choose from. There's a lot of people like you.\n\nI voided my ballot last provincial election. I suppose you could do that if you want to "send a message" 
Agreed. I bring this sort of thing up, because while I'm really amazed at the growth of socialist movements in North America right now, I think we are very desperate for any kind of win. Most comrades are around the age where they grew up dealing with the hellhole that 90s neo-liberalism produced on the left. It can create a certain mindset of "we should build ANY left movement, as long as the word socialism is attached to it!" If you look at socialist parties of the 20th century, however, you see the hardest part of the struggle only begins *after* the party "makes it big"\n\nWe don't want the party to "sell out" right after we makes it big. We should learn from past mistakes, and start talking about it right now. \n
Hey, maybe your grandma is a revolutionary Marxist who believes that feminists should be armed. You know, to take on the capitalist-patriarchal machine \n\n
Eh, it was a brief surge for social democratic parties, which is an exciting prospect, but the Marxists aren't  rushing into a revolutionary era yet. Our job should be to analyze the way history is changing. If we do think this is a trend, then what can we do to upset this trend? For example, Corbyn may be on his way out, but you can't deny as a Eurosceptic himself, his lacklustre campaign changed the outcome. What sort of blow does the Brexit give to neoliberal capitalism and how will it open new opportunities for Marxists to enter the fore? This is what we should be asking
This is so true. The thought "Why don't I just move somewhere else" was completely foreign to most people living in pre modern Asia, or even Europe. The whole idea of 'freedom of movement' didn't come until the end of feudalism in Europe, and the beginning of industrial capitalism, when people had to move in search of wage labour\n\nBesides, even if you were of low caste or class, you probably believed in a god/diety that had a perfectly good reason for putting you there. It was something almost pre-determined. You were given a set of social expectations, rules and customs to live out your days, and that was that. 
>isn't the overall idea of the US's economy a state run by the working class?\n\nNo, not by a long shot. I'm not even saying this subjectively. Liberal Democracy was an idea fought for by lawyers, merchants and industrialists, not working people\n\nIt was the dawn of Western Capitalism, and these men were getting extremely rich. They wanted political power to lobby for their own interests. The problem was that at this time in Europe, all power was controlled by a monarch, aristocrats or the church. It was a closed political system. \n\nSo they fought for their own right to enter the arena, and won. Of course they immediately put up property requirements for voting to keep the riff raff out and all that. And it worked quite well for them. After the French Revolution, for example, they made trade unions illegal, and sold off state land to the highest bidder. \n\nUniversal suffrage was fought for tooth and nail by the working class. The system wasn't intended to represent all of us. We fought for that right, and we still have a long way to go. 
Go chronologically. Start with first international, Marx and Bakunin. Then the rise of the SPD in Germany. Read Rosa Luxembourg and learn about the crisis during wwII. Also read Lenin, Trotsky and Mao. Don't forget Mao.
If you think you can actually make it under this system, then by all means try. \n\nIf you get a good job, support socialist movements with money and volunteer your time. We all need funding, and will for some time now. Subscribe to socialist publications, and if you're in a party with a sliding scale of dues, let them know you can afford to pay more. 
Include some women! How about Angela Davis? She's not a democratic socialist but she brings a feminist analysis in that would attract many more people to the brochure imo
I feel like there's a difference between being happy and being fulfilled. I know lots of people who are happy working minimum wage jobs, smoking tons of pot and partying on the weekends. But I also know my dad, who probably works 80+ hours a week trying to push through projects in the civil service. He's always stressed out, sleeps little, and doesn't have time for hobbies, but you can tell he's super proud of what he does. \n\nI'm like my dad. I don't think I could ever be "happy" working 25 hours a week and doing whatever I wanted in my free time. I need something to devote myself to wholeheartedly. And I know it's going to be shit sometimes. There's going to be a lot of stress and pain, emotional turmoil etc - but fuck, it's worth it if you can look back at your life and be proud of what you've done 
Do you think most other Germans feel the same way as you? I live in Canada, and we think we are absolute *saints* for taking in Syrian families, but we seem to forget that its only a small fraction of what European countries are dealing with. \n\nI'm generally very pro immigration, but I also know my history, and I understand that mass migration can have a big effect on the social fabric of any society. \n\nSo I'm curious, what events have made you take on this view? And do you know many people who have changed their views to be more hardline on immigration? 
Thanks for all the suggestions. Risen 1 and Two Worlds 2 look amazing. I really liked TES and Fable series, and these look similar
Yeah, to be fair I now know what I did wrong. It's much easier to go east-west than North-South. And the West coast is generally more laid back about it \n\nBut yeah, I could just tell by people's reaction in Boston and NYC when I told them I hitchhiked. Some people in their 20s didn't even know what hitchhiking was! Or they thought I was really weird. I had to constantly be like "No, I'm normal! Its chill where I come from!" \n\n
You don't necessarily need the media to win an election. I think Trump proves that. Or at least, you don't need the media to like you. Trump played off of all the negative attention he got through mainstream media, and somehow got even more popular. \n\nI don't know if that strategy would work with a radical left candidate, or if the media would find some new way to shut them down. Either way, I don't think Corbyn has the right personality to pull it off. It's unfortunate 
I would agree with them from a tactical perspective, but I would specify independent poor people's organizations instead of charities. If they were well funded, I would prefer the people autonomously controlling welfare rather than a neoliberal bureaucracy
My first thought for Trotsky was [Jay Baruchel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Baruchel) he was actually in a movie called *The Trotsky* based entirely around the fact that he looks like Trotsky. I don't know if he could pull off the persona though
Labels are for soup cans. I don't like the idea of labeling myself anything, because in a healthy mind, your ideas are always changing. \n\nYou'll notice many Marxists bounce between tendencies throughout their lifetimes, and that's fine. Marxism is a science, so it doesn't accept absolutes. Our views change depending on historical events, and time-tested experience. 
Or that free speech is a bourgeois construct that's never existed at all. \n\nThe capitalist parties are content to maintain the 'equal platform, fair shake' pluralism in times of peace and prosperity when they aren't threatened. When shit goes down, however, you begin to see the true colours of the bourgeois parliament. \n\nThey will dredge up old rules, make new ones, or blatantly disregard all of them, opting instead to just force through their will with violence and bloodshed. This has been happening since radicals were imprisoned during McCarthyism, up until the present day with the War on Iraq, Drone strikes and torturing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. \n\n'Free Speech' is just a facade that even Hitler maintained until the Reichstag fire. It wasn't his election to power that signaled a turn to tyranny. It was the Reichstag fire. That single event rolled decades of progressivism, and liberal democracy under its bootheel. 
Enlighten us how it is not
Fellow Atlantic Canadian here. \n\nPeople here just don't like work. It's not just EI. It's people showing up late for work, abusing alcohol and drugs at work, calling in sick frequently for work etc. Most of my friends do at least one of these things regularly.\n\nI don't think we're lazy though. I think we're cynical. We don't get paid nearly as much as the rest of Canada, there's not much mobility, and the jobs we do have suck. You could work your ass off, but if you don't have education, you end up half crippled at 60, still poor and even more cynical. It's kind of like workers in the last days of the Soviet Union. We have no motivation and we're cynical as fuck. \n\nYou could go out West and work your ass off. At least then you can afford a new truck, maybe a down payment on a house. But working your ass off out here? At a manual labour job? A lot of people figure it's just not worth it. Much better to smoke a shitload of weed and put in your bare minimum at Tim Hortons, or go on EI or w/e\n\n\n\n
You know why they were so quick to report you to the police? Because that shit happens all the time with people in debt. They will hunt you down to get that money. In most places you can't even declare bankruptcy to escape it. No wonder people commit suicide. \n\nFunny how they forced you to go to a paid psychiatrist as well - which probably costs a shit ton of money. Damn, I live in Canada and I'm pissed off at our healthcare and higher education systems fucking us over, but seriously, your country sounds so much worse. So glad I don't live there. 
IMO there's a big difference between working class and middle class. \n\nWhile many in the middle classes still sell their labour power for a wage, their positions are inherently tied to the profitability of the employer. Anyone in the developed world who: \n\n-works in middle management or up, including managers, CEOs and partners\n\n-self employed or entrepreneurs\n\n-working in the inflated financial sector who's profits are tied to global imperialism. \n\n-Those who have significant investment in stocks, bonds or securities (More than just a pension plan or RESP)\n\nGranted, most of these would be considered 'upper middle class', and there certainly are middle class professions who aren't co-opted or bought into capitalist accumulation, but we must be aware that the middle class is an *ideological mixed bag*, especially in the West. And that's not to mention the power of ideology that hides the existence of actual class exploitation. If class war spiraled into violence right now, it would be the poor vs the middle classes. The bourgeoisie would sit back and pull the strings without stepping into the fray. 
Look up from your screen and take a look around you. Four walls, tables, clothing, books, food. Everything we take for granted was built by someone. The things we're using to type on are more than just products - sweat and blood was put into these. The working class makes up the majority of the world's population. The working class is what makes modern civilized, technologically advanced life possible. \n\nAnd being 'working class' is more than having a moustache and wearing suspenders. The world is divided into two classes: those who own and those who have to work to survive. Most of us fall under the latter, even if we're pushing papers 9-5 at an office job. 
Hey, if you really want to know something interesting -\n\nWe didn't really know how the Sun had been burning for as long as it had been (well, at least as long as the age of the rocks we'd been finding on Earth) until someone was able to explain nuclear fusion in **1929.**\n\nThat means there are people alive today who existed at a time when you could look up at the Sun, ask "How does it make heat and light?" and there wasn't really a satisfactory answer.\n\nThis giant ball of gas that is the source of all life on Earth, that we've been staring at since before we came* down from the trees and we didn't know how in the actual fuck it worked until 87 years ago.  \n\nMy grandmother was 6 when Atkinson and Houtermans first figured that shit out.  She's still alive.\n\n1951, five years before my parents were born, was the first time we actually did it.\n\nThat's some pretty wild shit.
Interlocks have gotten a bit more complicated.  As they currently stand, the the device not only requires blowing at random intervals while the vehicle is in operation, but it also takes a photo of the operator while they're blowing.  The idea being that they check for operator sobriety, not that the owner is also the operator.\n\nThat may explain why the other person drove her car around for a little while before trading spots.  Start it -> Drive until the check pings -> Pass the test -> Trade it with the judge -> Go about rest of your day.  I don't know how extensive the interval is or how often it kicks in during operation cycles, but I'm willing to bet the judge does.\n\nSource:  Work with a guy who got caught.  Got an interlock installed on his car.
I voted for single-payer.  Now you can tell all the people who can't make enough to feed themselves, their families, or pay their rent why exactly the same as what they have now is their best bet.\n\nYou don't get it - this isn't a race to the bottom.  It isn't about who's losing more.  It's that all those people are already in a shit position and you're telling them to keep endorsing their shit position because it's better for someone else.  At some point you're asking for blood from a stone.\n\nI'm glad your wife is alive.  Consider how many people have nothing because of all the other policies that have gotten us to this place in the first place.\n\nNevermind - you won't.  That's fine.  I'm done with this anyway.  Back to work.\n\nGood luck in what you do.  Hopefully you can find someone who progressives can tolerate voting for.
President Bernie Sanders
Let's not even begin to discuss the scientific advancements required to wirelessly transmit voice at around a continent, regardless of how full of shit that voice is. 
Jesus, I had this *exact* same thing happen to me on the Wednesday after Columbine.  Guess who\n\n - Was suspended the rest of the year\n - Had their house searched by the cops\n - Had to get psych eval'd\n - Go through a scared-straight ("This is totes not a scared straight program.  Now, see what getting booked and locked up is like at the county jail!") program\n - Had to get a lawyer and take it to the district to be allowed to start 10th grade that Fall?\n\nAll that for responding to "Are you going to blow up the school?" with an emphatic, "Fuck no."  Yeah, being 13 was fucking great.
> Bernie voters are actually happy about Trump being elected\n\nI'm a Bernie voter.  I'm not at all happy about Trump winning.  The same goes for my Bernie-voting friends and my Bernie-voting family.  We were out marching yesterday to reflect that.  It's very important for the Democratic party to realize why they lost - and it isn't solely because middle America is full of asshats like yourself.  It's because they were given a choice between Donald Trump and a Republican whom has already been the cause of their decline.\n\nI'm still waiting for you to point out where I stated millions of people went to Bernie rallies or Hillary didn't win the nomination.  I doubt you'll respond to any of the points that I raised (and sourced) with any modicum of discourse.  I expect you'll just continue to throw insults, baseless assumptions and insinuations because rather than make an effort to understand why the Democrats lost to the worst (well, by way of election, second worst) candidate for president, you'd rather just call everyone else the problem.\n\nYou should take a deep breath and a long look in the mirror, because, sadly, the only person being a child here is you.  I do sincerely pity you and despite the fact that you're unable to act like an adult in society, I will continue to fight to preserve the rights, freedoms and hard-won protections that we have been working towards for at least the decades that I have been politically active.  \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.  When you're done hurling childish insults and sulking about how you put up the only person who could lose to Trump, feel free to join the adults who will be fighting to hold his balls to the flame and cleaning up your mess.\n\nGood luck.

Perhaps your community college can help you out with that - just make sure it'll transfer in (I don't see why it wouldn't; Physics II is pretty consistent).\n\nMy local CC offers plenty of 100-200 level courses that transfer to most every SUNY school as is (I'm in NY).  I took a few math courses there during summer sessions to lighten my semester load.  Made a big difference walking into my Math Methods of Physics class having already taken Linear Algebra and Diff. Eq.
Going to need peer-reviewed sources on both those claims.\n\nEDIT:  So, instead of responding, you decided to downvote and move on.  That's fine.  Your claim is then dismissed with the same amount of evidence with which it was substantiated; None at all.

Try:\n\nchicks-ooo-luhb\n\nI'll admit, I haven't heard it pronounced in a long time, but if I were speaking at my usual Northeast US city dweller rate, I'd probably say it as "chickslub."
I'm an American F1 fan who cut the cord 12 years back.  Once in a while there are races I can watch live over broadcast TV (Monaco, CoTA).  Even then I *still* fire up a Sky stream because the picture-in-picture commercials they put up every five minutes are horrifically annoying.  I tried for one race and was about to tear my hair out if I had to see Jensen Button doing squats for Vodaphone once more.\n\nI swear to god I know more about English betting websites than anything they're trying to push on American TV at this point.  I give money to the streamer each race as well.  I'm willing to bet the money he gets from more is a lot more than the ROI per captia coming off attacking me with ads for the entirety of the race.
Well, to be honest, the first violation is usually met with by a warning from the actual office responsible for these kinds of violations:  The Office of Governmental Ethics (OGE).  It would likely be exactly the same regardless of administration.\n\nIf she does it again, however...
Wait, this is happening in May now?  I'm so confused.
Well, Angelo is the guy that bought the Medley Center for $100k.  I'm fairly certain Mama's not around anymore.

No kidding. I mean, none of the Bond villains were dumb. 
That's what I was thinking.  More white space -> longer page -> more space to slap adverts.\n\nThat entire page, not counting breaks for quotes, would be about two paragraphs in length.
Catholicism IS Christianity. Or are you telling me that the Vatican isn't Christian? It's going to be a long time before I'm willing to think that the Pope isn't Christian. 
Perhaps you don't understand that people are sick of the already-stained republic with Clinton.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump is so hated, millions of people still could not hold their nose and vote for a candidate that they felt was equally (or at least on the same order of magnitude of) as destructive.  That's the point that you "literally cannot fathom."  Learn to digest that and perhaps you'll understand why the Democrats will need to *actually* run people who *actually* embody the principles that the Democratic party once professed to *actually* fight for.\n\nThis is a simple thread to follow.  The Democrats just had a massive number of failed elections to which the common root cause is their neoliberal policy which are embodied by the Clinton politic.  They have been destructive and disillusioning to the point that people were willing to sit out this election because they were given no actual choice.\n\nThe point here is that instead of shouting about how bad Trump is, you should consider how **bad things have to be** for people to sit on their hands when given a choice between him and more of the same.  You can't fathom people NOT voting against Trump because you can't fathom how bad it has been as a result of the neoliberal policy.
At the Bernie rallies.
Wow.  You doubled down on being wrong.  Mustard gas *and* World War **2**?
I'm not defending Islam.  I've not made a single claim on for/against the immigration ban.  My point was that the argument\n> The only ones that are problematic are the ones who believe sharia law should be the norm. There are plenty of Muslims who denounce radical islam.\n\nis very easily applied to other Abrahamic religions, including the fundamentalist Christians in the United States.  And that the fundamentalist Christians have already been successful in legislating the Christian version of "Sharia law."  My experience has been that all the religions of the book are violent and restrictive and the vast majority of their followers can claim the position of righteousness by pointing to their version of the book and saying, "That's what God says."\n\nYour question has nothing to do with this thread.
Pump the angry brakes.  I just said the analogy isn't all that great.  I didn't make a single comment on the legality of it.\n\nFor the record, I have no qualms with making the intentional connection to a known private network without the consent of an owner/operator illegal.
> maybe even entertaining.\n\nDidn't we just go through a Presidential election where this was the problem?  "Entertaining" elections rarely contribute anything of substance or useful policy.
From 2010, Frontline followed a terminally ill man and his wife who had to travel overseas to pass with dignity.  It's a pretty emotionally intense program, but it's very, *very* good.  The episode was titled "[The Suicide Tourist](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/)."  You can watch it for free on their website.\n\nWhere he traveled, the final act was required to be taken by the person themselves.\n\n
> So I'd say both upstate and western NY would be accurate descriptions of buffalo\n\nI understand your reasoning here, but to the people *of* Buffalo you are wrong.  And frankly they're the ones that get to choose the acceptable name of the region they live in.  It doesn't matter how many people want to call it Upstate if those people don't live in Western New York.  All it does is prove how ignorant those people are.\n\nI've lived in both places at varying times in my life.  If people in Buffalo referred to Queens as "Long Island" because it's factually geographically located ON Long Island, that doesn't mean it's the correct name for Queens.  It means those people referring to Queens as Long Island are ignorant of the area's name.\n\nIf, after learning what the people in that area generally agree on as the proper title for the place in which they live, someone *still* insisted on calling Queens, "Long Island," that person would no longer be ignorant, but simply, factually wrong.
Hey, I'm sorry things have been tough lately.  All I can say is that I understand what that's like.  And that I'm glad to know that you're still around.
They actually do the foot race in the reverse direction of the track.  That said, there are two big drops.  By my GPS track up there:\n\n 1. Turn 7 at the toe of the Boot followed by climbing the hill toward turn 6\n 2.  The descent from turn 4 off the back straight going into turn 3.
Well, it sort of does if I can reach the inside of that house without stepping foot outside of mine.\n\nThe house analogy doesn't really work for broadcast spectrum.
And you keep missing the point that for millions of Americans, they lost either way.  You're upset because they didn't vote for *your* candidate - under which they'd still lose.  You're asking people with nothing to toss themselves upon your pyre and got all pissy when they told you to go blow.
It's not the law, but it's certainly the standard operating procedure in an airplane.  Use the autopilot for as much as possible.  The machine can fly a heading and altitude better than a human.  Use the human to keep an eye on everything else, recognize and handle situations the machine can't.  It's a billion times safer.\n\nDriverless cars, so far, are an order of magnitude less likely to get in an accident than a human.  I'm all for it.  Fifty years from now, they'll be far more normalized.  You and I are in complete agreement.

A more apt metaphor would be a choice between a cook who might poison people or a cook who is the reason everyone's starving in the first place.\n\nI have the ability to chose neither.  Which is what the pragmatic person would do.  The country is going to bleed either way.  I'm still in a position where I don't have any blood on my hands.  \n\nFrankly, as a person who voted for Bernie twice last year, I can say I made a shit ton more effort to stop Trump compared to the candidate who actively pushed for him to be her competition.\n\n> We need to be elevating the Pied\tPiper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to them seriously\n\n[Source](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/1120/251).  The people responsible for Trump being taken seriously are the ones who lost to him, the same ones that delegitimized themselves in the primary process and disenfranchised the progressive base.  They lost because they coronated a candidate.\n\n> Edit: and maybe you children will discover pragmatism when you grow up\n\nI'm glad you used your edit opportunity to "nah-uh" me.  It's a very Trump thing to do.  ["No puppet.   No puppet.  *You're* the puppet."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVWRetR4jg) Perhaps you deserve each other.
No joke on the not listening to the radio anymore. I put a Bluetooth stereo in my car and just end up putting on podcasts or a playlist. If I do flip to the radio it's *to listen to NPR. \n\nOther than NPR, they could shut down every local radio station and I'd be completely ignorant of it. 
Should put in perspective exactly how on edge administration was after Columbine.  They suspended a bunch of people that year.\n\nA kid I knew asked if I was going to bomb the school while we were on the bus that morning.  I responded as indicated.  He either decided he didn't believe me, or lied when he went to them, but he went to administration and told them about the discussion he initiated and I ended.  Third or fourth period (or whichever period I had Spanish) I was called in, given the maximum suspension the principal was authorized to give without further board approval (a week out of school, pending hearing with district administration).\n\nMy mother was called and had to leave work to come get me.  The police were called and escorted us out.  My older sister (by a year) was home sick that day and all she knew was that I was in trouble.  My mother had to go back to work and didn't go into details.  I wasn't particularly interested in talking.  My sister answered the phone when the guidance counselor from my school called and told her to "keep an eye on me so that he doesn't harm himself or anyone else."  So, of course, my sister figured i was going to kill myself now that Mrs. King - that horrendous guidance counselor - just told a 14 year old girl to put her brother on suicide watch.\n\nI should add that I was about 5 feet tall and hadn't yet broken 100 lbs.  I had zero history of violence.  No fights.  No previous suspensions.  I was, however, a person who kept to myself and this was well known by the staff.  The district has 9th grade separate from middle/high schools as a result of the way the town expanded so the people who work in that school literally deal with one grade and one grade of students only.  They are hyper involved with students and in a town where extreme extroversion is expected to be the norm, those that are not are deemed 'at risk' and watched with wary eyes.\n\nSo, of course, rumors flew whichever way they could, hyped by the game of telephone and people seeking attention in a crisis.  My sisters still had to go to school and our ages span ~4 years, so it wasn't like this happened in a bubble limited only to me.  The splash damage of this falling over onto them hung heavy on my head for a while, too.  Everyone talks and they had to not only hear it, but be associated with it.  I've never spoken in depth about it to them, but there was no way they weren't affected.\n\nAdmin wanted to show everyone they were tough and found the first person they could to prove that.  Out of everyone, they came down on me hardest (I was the first they went after).  The district was pushing to have me completely expelled.\n\nIt was a tough fight considering I'd generally kept to myself.  The list of character references a 13 year kid has isn't exactly long in the first place.  Plus, they're just *other* 13 year old kids - and I didn't blame anyone who didn't want to get near this dumpster fire of a crisis (or their parents for not allowing it).  The lawyer was able to get a 'voluntary suspension' until the end of the year and, pending the scared straight program and multiple sessions being evaluated by a child psychologist (all out of pocket of course, and his final comments to the district was something like, 'Well adjusted despite the malicious actions of the administration'), I was allowed to return in the Fall to start 10th grade.  The district had to pay for tutors through the end of the year and I was required to take my finals separate from the rest of the student body - with the dozen or so other kids who'd been suspended that year.\n\nTook me a few years to really accept that I hadn't actually done anything wrong and that people can be pretty severely punished for having been completely innocent. \n\nEDIT:  I should add that the town is very Columbine-esque in demographic.  I say that because whenever something bad happens, they *love* to say, "It could happen here."  When 9/11 happened (my senior year) I was sitting in TV/Electronic Media class in our media lab.  The TV was on in the other room so the dozen of us in that class were watching when the 2nd plane hit live.  Later that day in gym class one of the coaches remarked that "It could happen here."  No, Coach, terrorists aren't going to fly a plane into a high school in a suburb of Rochester.  It just isn't going to happen.  Period.
To piggy back on this, Monroe County alone has an enormous amount of trailway.  Along with the Erie Canal Path and Genesee River Trail, individual park maps can be found on \n\nhttps://www2.monroecounty.gov/parks-trailmaps\n\nand many parks connect into each other.\n\nAlso, because I'm most familiar with the East side, it's worth nothing that Perinton's Crescent Trail is one of the most extensive - if not *the* most extensive - systems in the county with spurs and branches all over the place and covering, effectively, the entire footprint of the town.  PDF maps are available at \n\nhttp://www.perinton.org/Departments/Parks/hikingctha\n\nThe terrain ranges from steep hills to flat meadows to everything in between.\n\nThe #trailsroc running group is an invaluable resource for anyone even cursorily interested in trail running pretty much anywhere within a day's round-trip drive including Letchworth State Park (the Genesee River canyon) and the Finger Lakes.\n\nhttps://trailsroc.org/\n\nEDIT:  Also, welcome!
I feel like this is a question that can be asked of *every* part of the car, though.  For example:\n\n> The steering wheel should probably be eliminated because it's a protrusion into the cockpit and that's dangerous for the driver.\n\nMoreover, the steering wheels on old cars were slightly notorious for being a great way to get impaled.\n\nI mean, are airbags an unreasonable consideration for an F1 car?  I get they won't prevent Massi/Bianchi accidents, but they sure as hell do a great job at dispersing the energy of the driver, which is desirable in incidents like Alonso's.  I'm not a racecar engineer/driver, so I sincerely don't have an answer to that.
> Plus, one of my cousins that works in a private school would much prefer to work in the public school system because the benefits and pay is much better than private.\n\nThis is likely because the public school has a union and private school does not.  It's certainly the case around where I've lived.\n
For what its worth, in civilian courts, lie detectors which do not meet scientific standard (error rates, peer-review) are inadmissible and even if they do, they're still only allowed on the judge's discretion.\n\nMilitary courts outright ban them entirely.\n\nNot criticizing, just pointing out that polygraph tests, etc, are not really all that reliable.\n\nhttp://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2013/01/are-lie-detectors-admissible-in-court.html\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-02/will-lie-detectors-ever-get-their-day-in-court-again-
I don't think it was so much Pro Hillary as much as it was Anti-Trump.\n\nI very sincerely believe that Vermont Jesus hates Donald Trump more than anyone else in that level of government.  And I love that he's going to be taking Trump to task for the next four years by using Trump's own words.\n\nThere isn't any dirt on Bernie.  He's beloved by millions.  He was screwed by the DEM machine.  The man is unassailable and he's holding Trump's balls to the fire.  And if there's one thing we know about Bernie its that he spits hot fire.
Man, I completely forgot about Vinnie and Angelo.
The notion of flipped and not flipped might be lost in the future when hourglasses become obsolete.
I voted for Bernie in the primary.  I wrote him in on the general.  I worked my ass off to get everyone I knew to vote for him.  Got people registered.  Participating.\n\nBefore the country completely crumbles and everyone's 401k evaporates in the morning, I'm to take this opportunity to warn everyone I know that for the next few days, and every time Trump does something shitty (like put Kim Davis on the Supreme Court):\n\nTHE SMUG FUCKING FACE MACHINE IS GOING TO BE HITTING ON ALL 12 FUCKING CYLINDERS, RUNNING NITROMETHANE AND SCREAMING THE TURBO  WITH THE WASTEGATE FULLY CLOSED.  YOU DUMBFUCKS GAVE THIS ELECTION AWAY. \n\nI'm going to be that smug son of a bitch for the next few days and I've fucking earned it.
You ever been to a Catholic church? I grew up Catholic. They absolutely consider the Bible to be the direct word of God. 
Just venturing a guess:\n\nThey specifically said the satellite feed was sending only that frame as the satellite feed was on top of the North tower.  So I figure the satellite feed - when its source cut - just keep sending the last frame in the buffer downstream until it ping an update as sort of a default.  Since it didn't get any updates, it just sat in an indefinite loop on that last frame and thus everyone who subscribed to that feed only saw that last frame.\n\nI have no idea what the local OTA coverage was doing.
It would also be tacit admission that this caricature of them has some basis in reality.  Trump, at least, cannot abide by anyone thinking any less than the best of him.  It's why he gilds every lily he gets near and claims himself Midas.  It's why he slaps his name on every last thing and denies the (factual, repeat) failures.\n\nIn the end, he's a sad little boy that the cool kids won't let into their treehouse.  Everything he does is motivated by getting back at the cool kids - to show them he's better than them.  That he's beat them.\n\nHe's slapped his name on a pile of wet sand, called it an "Empire" and proclaimed himself a success.  They didn't care.  He's achieved the highest office in the last in an attempt to command their respect - and no one does.  He doesn't understand that people respect the office and respect the man separately - of which he commands none.  Between Trump (President Bannon) and Bush II (President Cheney), people aren't even willing to lend him the credibility which generally comes with it.  And with good reason.\n\nHe thought the power of the office of the President would rub off on him and finally earn him the respect of the cool kids, but instead the adults in the room understand that letting the Trump name be synonymous with the Office of the President would only tarnish the office.\n\nHe's the try-hard "nice guy" at the bar who can't seem to get a date because, frankly, he's a giant piece of shit.  He's the acting out bully who only embarrasses everyone else with his antics.\n\n> He may be rich, but he'll always be *Queens* rich.\n\n> -Anthony Atamanuik\n\n  He's never going to get the one thing he wants above all else, which is precisely why he'll never get it; He'll never have the respect of the people he believes are actually important.  He may have won the public contest, but he knows in his heart that he's still lost because even with the prestigious title of POTUS, no one who matters actually respects *him.*\n\nHe'll always be Queens rich.  That's fine for a lot of us, but Trump knows it'll never be good enough for him.  Since he can't accept that, it will always hold him back.  He will forever look into a mirror and see a loser.\n\nI'd pity him if he wasn't tearing the country apart because of his own insecurities.

> the infrastructure just isn't there. And it's in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe two biggest reasons F1 won't come back to the Glenn.  It's a shame, because that track is absolutely awesome.  I get to do a [foot race on it during the spring](http://i.imgur.com/1nfj4JK.png) and it makes me feel like the F1 drivers who jog the track on race weekend.  God damn that course has some hills.  It really would be phenomenal to watch modern F1 cars on it.\n\nEDIT:  Should put the race info up, as it's a charity run and it's for a good cause.  It's on April 8th this year.  That's  73 days away.  Plenty of time to get yourself in a position to jog 3.4 miles.  http://arcgrandprixrun.org/ $25 fee includes the shirt.

What's FBS?  Sincerely.\n\nNVM.  Just looked it up.  I think you are greatly overestimating the number of people who care about college football.
I'm going to open with the fact that I absolutely agree with you.\n\nHowever, I'm also going to point out that many states had already long established the legal framework to prevent someone like Bernie from being elected in the primary.\n\nFor example:  The State of New York requires every person already registered to vote to affiliate with a party by the beginning of **October the year previous** to vote in said party's primary in **April.**  It's ridiculous that the affiliation date was before even the first democratic debate.\n\nIn conjunction with facts like the DNC colluding news organizations to ignore primary challengers in favor of their pre-coronated choice - and that those major news outlets played along - I'm not surprised that many people didn't know of other options before it was too late.\n\nJust as much an issue with people not being directly active in the political process 13 months before the actual election is that we have a political process which takes over a year out of every 4 to run an election.\n\nI don't expect Americans to start researching viable candidates beyond "normal" news outlets (i.e. broadcast media, newspapers, etc) in March of 2015 for a November 2016 election.\n\nThe single biggest failure that came out of the 2015-2016 election season is the evidence that our system of elections fails to accurately represent the demographic make up of the persons casting ballots and, in fact, actively discourages taking part in that process in the first place.\n\nThe US - nay, the world - lost this election because a system legally empowered to discourage people from voting for the purposes of monopolizing political power into a market controlled explicitly by two parties (which is then battled over by said parties) was able to effectively do just that.\n\nDismantle a system which makes voters register before the *first fucking debate* and watch the numbers of people taking active part in the political conversation skyrocket.  This election was proof that when Americans actually WANT to take part in that conversation, they are gridlocked by framework designed expressly to prevent all but the most dyed-in-the-wool follower of the two major parties from doing so.
Make one yourself.  That way you'll have original research and you can be certain your sources are peer-reviewed and unbiased.  Post it here when you're done and others can check to ensure it's factual/complete (i.e. peer review it).
Oh, sorry, I wasn't calling you out explicitly.  I just thought it was funny.  I can see how that could be taken as mean spirited - It certainly wasn't intended to be.  Sorry.

I've read what you've written and none of it is new to me.  However, I'm long willing to bet that if you go into any evangelical church on Sunday and poll those attending service you will come out FAR ahead with, "The Bible is the literal word of God" and "The word of God is perfect."
You're right.  You win.  Just like Hillary did.

To supply the other two.\n\n - [He Mocked POW's](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317)\n - [and Gold Star families](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/us/politics/donald-trump-khizr-khan-wife-ghazala.html)\n\nThose are, of course, just the initial point.  As with all things, when people called him on it he'd dig deeper until the next verbal crisis.  These two, specifically, were pretty famous events and widely publicized.  Especially because the POWs one started as him going after John McCain very early in the race.

1.  Buffalo isn't Upstate.  It's Western New York.  Gotta be North of Central NY to be in Upstate.  If you're in Western New York and you try to go north you just end up in Lake Ontario.  It just simply isn't in Upstate.  It's like telling people who live in Madrid that they live in France.  They don't.\n\n2.  Buffalo is a major metropolitan area.  The idea of raising the minimum wage in an isolated part of the state and lumping the other major cities in with "farm country" is one of the reasons the other major cities are struggling.\n\nThe cost of living in Whitney Point and the cost of living in Downtown Buffalo *are as different as Whitney Point and Long Island, yet Buffalo is effectively subject to the same state policy as Whitney Point.  Despite being substantially different.\n\n2 1/2 million people live between the Buffalo and Rochester areas, yet the get lumped in with minimum wage, development and investment policy designed to get a farm tractor down the road and that's about it.  Only in recent years has there been much focus on the rest of the state and it's in some pretty rough shape as a result.\n\n**EDIT**:  Also, Buffalo is home to the **ONLY** NFL team that plays in the great state of New York.  Don't let New Jersey fool you.
I don't know.  I hear Chicago is pretty rough...
The President doesn't have legal authority over fiscal policy. Congress has the power of the purse. \n\nAlso, that may violate NAFTA. The President doesn't have the authority to violate international treaties. Congress would have to nullify NAFTA, first. 
Both the context of the time and the condition will make it pretty clear as to why it is/was referred to as "Suicide Tourism."  A lot has changed since 2010.  Then again, a lot has stayed the same.
Magic Hat and Genesee are owned by the same parent company (North American Breweries).  Same with Seagrams Escapes.  For those two, it's not contract brewing - it's an in house product.
Just ask the Flight Engineers how well it worked out.\n\nAutomation, as a whole, is going to either require a fundamental shift in our economic system or we're going to be talking about food riots.\n\nFor those who think they're safe, keep in mind that I don't need to automate your job.  I only need to automate 1/3rd of your job and that'll cut the number of people needed in that position in half.  The rest will grind themselves into dust just trying to beat the next round of layoffs.\n\nHere's the thing:  The machine doesn't sleep.  It doesn't eat.  It doesn't need health care and it doesn't want a retirement.  One person can maintain millions at the click of a button.  Engineering will always get better.  The computer will always get smarter - and it doesn't have to learn all the foundation first when I make a new one.  I simply copy and paste the old information into it and it instantly contains all the previous knowledge and experience.\n\nAny time you put a human against a machine, the machine will win.  Maybe not immediately, but it will absolutely long run win.
I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. \n\nAlso, I'm probably safe - his tiny hands can't push the button down far enough to make the connection to launch.
Especially because that would imply that Obama lowered the rate and, as Trump is a fan of taking credit for things that happened before he sat down, that means the rate went UP under his 'law and order' watch.\n\nBig no-no.
http://www.pewforum.org/2013/12/30/publics-views-on-human-evolution/\n\nThat's a good place to start.  While the only groups that believed less in evolution than the Catholics were the Protestants, it's worth nothing that both groups came out at least 50/50 on God driving the evolutionary process.\n\nSo, if what you're claiming is that most Catholics believe in Evolution by means of Natural Selection (in the form of the current consensus-model, not the one attributed to Darwin), then that's incorrect.\n\nAnd to be honest, people don't so easily change their fundamental beliefs because "the Pope said so."  This guy is very new compared to living memory (inclusive of at least John Paul II and Benedict, who resigned).

I am from the East Coast.  That is true.\n\n[Also, it's third most at 11 percent and it's a long third from the NFL, which is at 35 percent.  MLB takes second at 14 percent.](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/10354114/harris-poll-nfl-most-popular-mlb-2nd)
And yet Hillary still lost because the best she could do was "I'm not Trump!"  Turns out that wasn't enough.\n\n> Anyone who calls themselves a leftist who failed to vote against Trump is a hypocrite.\n\nI could make the same argument that anyone who calls themselves a leftist and votes for Republican economics is much the same.  The fact that Obama - a moderate - was able to blow her out of the water and an unknown progressive was able to mount such a challenge that they had to spin up the DNC machine to beat him should indicate that the *actual* left base didn't want to vote for a Republican Clinton.\n\nOr you can keep blaming everyone else.  All it's doing is putting people like Trump in power.  As evident. \n\n >  if everyone who hates that he's president had showed up to vote for his opponent.\n\n"If only everyone voted for the person *I* wanted, we wouldn't be in this mess."\n\nIt's important to remember that voting against Trump is not the same as voting *for* Hillary.  At some point you'll need to accept that Trump is the fault of the Democratic Party.  They're the Buffalo Bills of political parties - constantly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\n> ...it pushed Hillary, ostensibly, further to the left.\n\nIt pushed a few sentences out of her mouth, but no one actually believed her.  Her credibility with the left was spent in the primary.  The best part about Hillary Clinton is that she believes whatever I believe.
> I did try and fuck her, even though she was married.  I moved on her like a bitch.  When you're a star, they let you do it.  You can do anything.  Grab them by the pussy.  You can do anything.\n\nWe've come a long way.
When I did the full here a couple years back I did most of my training on the Erie Canal path and the River trail on the weekends.  Worked nights during the week so I'd do things like run the Flower City Half route after work, or break apart spurs of it.\n\nHill training was usually done by doing sprints up and down Alpine at the Highland Park reservoir or that one big ass hill at the entrance of Mt. Hope cemetery.\n\nErie Canal is easy and flat enough, but if you're doing the Rochester Marathon you'd be better off going on the Riverway Trail north of the city since it just does two loops of that.  I'd usually start at the lake, run south to the Genesee Brewhouse, refill my water bottle there and then run back to the lake.  ~18 miles.
Haha. You can already get them with Tesla. Also, Uber in Pittsburgh uses driverless cars. And California's self-driving car regulatory framework is very mature, as well is the reason the substantial developments in self-driving tech was possible. 
[Here's the link](http://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A09284&term=2015&Summary=Y&Actions=Y) to his previous sponsorship around the same time last year (11 Feb 2016)\n\nThis legislation would be a major amendment to the state constitution.  The justification given on the parent link states:\n\n> JUSTIFICATION:\n\n> By creating a unicameral legislature New York State would save fifty\npercent of the current cost via administration, pensions, and salary. A\nunicameral legislature would set an example on real reform, streamline\nour state government, and end go nowhere bills that are not carried in\nboth houses.\n\nI haven't had the time to dig through the proposed amended constitution to see how the redistricting/representative process would work under this system, however the word "senate" would tend to indicate something which would likely over-represent smaller population groups rather than reflect the population's demographic (which is usually the intent of having two separate houses, regardless of whether they're *actually* composed in the intended fashion).\n\nBut, hey, half-off the price of representative government...apparently.
Imagine you had a bag full of fruit, but it's special.  It's a quantum mechanical bag of fruit so it has rules.\n\n1.  You can't see, feel, smell, or tell what's inside the bag\n2.  You can only pull out one piece of fruit at a time to look at it.\n3.  You gotta put it back in the bag afterwards.\n4.  There is not necessarily any promise that when you pull the fruit out of the bag again, it will be the same as before except for the very special condition that I'll cover first.\n\nYou'd like to know what kind of fruit you have.  So you reach into the bag and you pull out one.\n\n    red apple\n\nCool.  So you know there's at least one red apple in there.  You put it back in the bag (because the quantum mechanical bag has rules like this) and repeat.\n\n    red apple\n\nCool.  Got another red apple.  You repeat this a bunch of times and every single time, you pull out a red apple.  In fact, you look closer at the bag and it turns out it's actually labeled "red apples ONLY" so you can be certain that you'll only ever get a red apple out of it.\n\nIn Quantum Mechanics (and more generally, linear algebra) this is analogous to a condition known as an 'eigenstate,' or that it is in a 'definite state' of red apples.  What it means is that *every* time you reach into the bag, you will *definitely* get a red apple.\n\nLet's change up what happens.  Let's say you reach in and get your red apple the first time.  But the second time, it's different.\n\n    orange\n\nAnd successive times\n\n    lemon\n    green apple\n    cherry\n    watermelon (nice)\n    orange\n    orange\n    green apple\n    .\n    .\n    .\n\nThe bag of fruit is no longer in an eigenstate of red apples.  It's in a *superposition* of many different types (states) of fruit.  However, you can only reach into the bag and pull out one at a time.  If you do this a lot, you may notice a proclivity toward (highest probability of) oranges, but you can't promise that each time it'll be an orange.  Some grapes might come up once in a while.  People like grapes.\n\nSo, in quantum, we'd call the oranges in this case an *expectation value.*  The bag can return all these different types of fruit, but you're most likely to pull out oranges.  If I pulled out a fruit a bunch of times (always putting it back after), the distribution would always be highest on the expectation value, but never guaranteed to be.  It's not the "orange ONLY" bag.  It's the "orange-ish" bag.\n\nCompare this with the first bag, the one in a *definite* state of red apples - as long as no one changed the bag (like, by putting in new fruit when you aren't looking, sneaky sneaky), you'd *always* and *only* ever get out a red apple.\n\nTyping this up to quantum itself, the bag represents a wavefunction.  The fruit represents a measurement OF the wavefunction (say, its energy).  The wavefunction can be in a definite state of energy (red apple bag), so I'd only ever get one value out of it when I measured.  Every time I measured, it would be that value of energy.\n\nHowever, if it is not in a definite state (orange-ish bag), every time I measure the energy I'll get back one of any number of values.  Over time, the distribution of these measurements will center on some value called the Expectation Value (the oranges of before), but there is no guarantee that it would be this value every time.  It's MOST LIKELY to be this value, but that doesn't mean it will be every time, or even that the likelihood is very high.\n\nSo the orange-ish bag contains all these different states at all times, but when I actually measure (observe, reach into the bag, whatever) it, it only exhibits one of the entirety of possibilities.  The wave-bag-function is in a "superposition" of all these states it can take on, but upon observation it, it collapses into one value of the infinite number of possible states it CAN exhibit.\n\nSo, wavefunction x is composed of states a, b, c, d...etc, but when measured, you only get ONE of those states back.  It's a superposition of states which, on observation, collapses into ONE state.  If it's in an eigenstate of "a", you'll only ever get "a" back.  If not, you'll only get "a", "b",...etc at a time, but it can be any of them.  Where did the rest go when you made that observation?  Maybe they disappeared.  Maybe they branched and created the infinite other many worlds?  Physics doesn't have the answer for this (yet, maybe never?  idk).\n\nSo, Heisenberg...\n\nWell, as I recall the idea has been around longer than his name was attached to it, but I'm not well versed in that side of history.  So, basically is says there are certain pairs of variables that can't get perfectly nailed down.  The easiest one is momentum and position.\n\n    sigma_x * sigma_p >= h_bar / 2\n\nSo uncertainty of position (sigma_x) multiplied by uncertainty of momentum (sigma_p) is always greater than 1/2 of the reduced Planck constant (h_bar, or h divided by 2pi).  So if you're getting REALLY REALLY precise with position, you're getting (at best) less and less precise with momentum.  You can't get exact values for both at the same time.\n\nImagine you're watching a car drive down a road.  You want to know exactly where it is, so you get a really high speed camera, snap a photo and see the car freeze-framed right on a spot.  Looking at that photo, can you see how fast it was going?  Maybe, if it was a little blurry and you knew the shutter speed you could figure it out, but that blurriness is just uncertainty in position.  If there's zero blur, there's no way to get speed.  If there's nothing BUT blur, there's no way to get position.  This principle kind of just says, "there's a maximum shutter speed to your camera."\n\nBasically, the whole "superposition" thing about many possible worlds doesn't really have anything to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n\nI'll also note that one of my old professors used to drive home the GREATER THAN part of the the >= hbar/2 because while the very BEST I can get is hbar/2 of accuracy, there is "No upper bound to my ignorance."\n\nSorry for the wall of text.  I hope that made sense.  It's 4:15 am here and I need to get some sleep for the day tomorrow.  There are likely MANY typos.  Rest assured, all the words are in a superposition of states that include the correct spelling.  Somewhere.
And yet at every mass the priest holds up the Gospel and states, "This is the word of the Lord" and every theology class I had to go to up until Confirmation drilled in my head that the Bible is the literal word of God, transcribed through his chosen people full stop. \n\nIf the divinity scholars feel differently, that's fine, but that is not at all what the church is telling their flock come Sunday. 
Nothing is to bigly.
I don't think it is a waste to point out that the thing that so many Americans are afraid of occurring is *already* occurring in America by their own hand using the same call to divinity as justification.
The WristWatchMonthly FAQ can't figure out the difference between plural and possessive forms of the word "fee."\n\nWhy would I give them $30/month for a watch?  Also, who the fuck needs to spend $360 a year on 12 cheap ass watches?  For $40 more (read: 13.3 months vs 12 months), you can buy a Garmin Triathlon GPS watch with a heart rate strap off Amazon.  It's waterproof, acts as a bluetooth watch to your phone and is substantially more durable than a $20 watch. \n\nThat's just idiotic.
First, you really need to learn what words are and are not capitalized when writing a heading or title.\n\nSecondly, and I say this with completely non-partisan intent, I'm going to need quite a few peer-reviewed sources to substantiate the statement\n\n> Clinton is the Biggest Criminal in US Political History...\n\nFeel free to post them in the comments.  The US has some pretty shady characters in its political history including Jackson invading Florida without formal declaration of war through Reagan committing treason with the Iran-Contra scandal, but forcing Oliver North to take the fall.\n\nAnd who could forget all those WMDs Dick Cheney found in Iraq...\n\nI'll add that I voted against Hillary twice in 2016.  Still going to need to see some citations.
This same argument can be applied to Christians who want to enact laws by citing Biblical motivations.  Mike Pence comes to mind.

Exactly... There are many many more forms of AI/ML than just neural nets or genetic algorithms.  Things like random forest decision tress are simply statical models applied by a computer with many thousands of iterations to find (in some cases) most significant features that would be able to indicate what stocks or bonds have the most influence on a market and to watch those specifically
Haha what are the odds!?  I climb at ABP bc it's easier to get there for me but love crux 
Can confirm
This can be extended to motor vehicles:\n\n - Electric vehicles require different safety standard (don't have a gas tank to protect, do have a giant source of electrical potential that that can ground through the passengers and other vehicles)\n\n - Self driving cars.  Kind of explains itself.\n\n - Extending self-driving cars to commercial operations such as buses, trucks and taxis.\n\nOr moving away from transportation:\n\n - Financial instruments such as derivatives (the lack of regulation over them is what caused the '08 collapse)\n\n - Voter ID laws require not only mass regulation, but generally a federal mandate of standardization\n\nand these are just off the top of my head.\n\nRegulations exist because when the status quo changes, it doesn't leave the past behind.  Old things are still on the books precisely because people still do them.  Old actions are not superseded by new ones.\n\nHeavy regulation doesn't mean "lots" of regulation - I can very easily split up long lines in to singular regulatory numbers.  Just as well, I can take three or four regulations, combine them into one and call it "reduced" regulation.\n\nThe idea that we need to impose some arbitrary one-half limit is a statement without merit or standing.  A requirement to streamline regulation as practicable is completely reasonable and absolutely should be undertaken, but the idea that there's some kind of hard numerical limit shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how administrative law actually works.\n\nBesides, we've already half a dozen new regulations along with your first one:\n\n    I. For every new regulation, two must be removed.\n        1. Except airplanes.\n                a. Also space.\n                b. Also UAVs (these aren't airplanes).\n        2. Except cars.\n                a. Mandated safety features like airbags and seatbelts cannot be done away with.\n                b. Moving to SMART traffic control devices mean we need to have a minimum legal standard to be met\n                        i. For things like court admissibility and insurance\n                        ii. That these exist doesn't mean old devices suddenly don't and their regs can disappear\n                c. And the self driving ones cause they crazy.\n        3.  Now we gotta talk about self-driving **commercial** vehicles.\n                a. Buses operate way differently than trucks\n                b. Trucks are also way different than cars and cabs.\n          .\n          .\n          .\n        105. Better hold off until we get standardized Voter ID figured out\n                a. Otherwise, gotta make a list twice the length of these new Voter ID regulations to scrap before we can implement them
> A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated\n\nFrom an Aviation perspective alone, this is nonsensical.  Commercial space exploration, light high powered aircraft and civilian UAVs *alone* mandate entire new segments of regulation.\n\nThese are massively different from the "normal" operations of both General Aviation and Commercial transport.  The advent of these new technologies require a very different set of operating rules than those current set for, say, fixed-wing flight instruction under 14 CFR 91.  The idea that we should, then, eliminate two of the already standing regulations simply to address the rise of SpaceX and an RC drone seems completely beyond the pale to me.\n\nThat in itself doesn't preclude the fact that the "normal" aircraft operations aren't themselves in a constant state of technological advancement.  Ten years ago the idea of flying a GPS-ONLY (without the aid of ground based equipment such as an ILS or baro-aided RNAV) approach down to precision minimums was insane.  However, by developing the regulatory framework which made these safe and reliable has not only substantially increased the number of airports which can be accessed in poor weather conditions (required for most commercial operations, thus revenue bearing), but has done so for little more than the cost of a sheet of paper.  Compare that to installing, aligning and maintaining a set of high precision ground based radio NAVAIDS such as localizers and glide slopes.\n\nWhile GA aircraft continue to develop, getting glass cockpits with full moving maps and satellite weather, that doesn't mean that 1974 Cardinal RG with the standard 6-pack and a couple of fuzzy radios I got my Flight Instructor Certificate in should no longer be subject to already effective regulation.  Nor that the insanely different systems we are installing are able to fit within the current regulatory framework.
Hillary both won my district and didn't want my help to do it.\n\nKeep blaming everyone else.  See how far that gets you.

> The right shows up and votes for their team, basically no matter what.\n\nAnd the Dems put up a candidate that Reagan would be proud to endorse.  No wonder the left stays home.\n\n
Nothing made at Genesee is made in Costa Rica.  What are you talking about?\n\nNot only is all Genesee branded beer made at High Falls (and several other contract brands) or at the pilot brewery in the restaurant, but the can would have to be labeled as "imported" if it was made out of the country.\n\nThere's a reason why Labatt Blue is labeled imported and Labatt Max Ice, Labatt Blue Light Lime and Labatt Brewers Collection aren't labeled as imported - because they're made by Genesee in Rochester.  Labatt USA (the import company) and Genesee are both under the same parent company: North American Breweries.  *That's* what's owned by Costa Rica.
Something to keep in mind is that a lot of the overseas electronics/textiles we get - particularly TVs - are assembled in Mexico specifically to get around tariffs by invoking NAFTA.  The parts are made overseas, shipped into to Mexico with little to no import tariff, pushed through final assembly, and dropped onto a truck.\n\nIf we repealed NAFTA (unlikely) and put a tariff on Mexico, we wouldn't really have much competition to turn to.  They'd have to be pretty astronomical for people to buy US electronics at a competitive level - not to mention that we don't have the infrastructure to produce those parts en masse in the first place - which is another cost the consumer would have to pay.\n\nNot picking sides - just pointing out that we don't really have much competition in a lot of major places.  Stuff that comes in from Mexico very often does just to skirt the US tariffs in the first place.
> There weren't millions of people at Bernie rallies.\n\nShow me where I said millions of people were at Bernie rallies - despite the fact that he was objectively pulling in more people than his pre-ordained competition.  You asked where the marches were before the election.  The Bernie rallies were doing just that.  I know, because I marched with them,\n\n> Hillary won the nomination.\n\nHmm.  I don't see anything regarding Hillary not winning the nomination either in the sentence, "At the Bernie rallies."  Please point that out as well.\n\nYou may need to realize that Trump won because people were given a choice between a Republican and Donald Trump.  I can't rationalize why anyone would vote for Trump considering all the baggage he brings along, however, I absolutely understand why many people wouldn't hold their nose for Hillary, either (for much the same reason).\n\nWhen you grow up you'll learn that adults understand things like that.

The point of this is to enhance their search and AI recommendations... It's simple really you give each app a set of features (which is what they are called ironically in AL/ML) and they are voted on how good they are so when people search or install apps with say a high finance tracking attribute you can get recommendations for better version or other apps people download in addition to those.  This enhances search so you get more and better results when searching for keywords in addition to app names.  It's good stuff really... Look at google map reviews it's the same shit

I don't understand, what does this have to do with Trump?
But you could learn how to talk backwards, then it's double backwards and people can understand you.  [And everything will be like this all the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0YI_eHg3Aw).
But they're not a big truck, they're a series of tube.
Are you crazy?  It's the weekend, he goes to Florida for the weekend, every weekend apparently.  And gets his ego stroked by people who pay $200,000 to get into the door of his resort.  And now, apparently, holds rallies for no reason at all other than an ego boost.
I just...  what?  What planet are these people on?  \n\n> of those who support it, 51 percent thought Conway’s remarks about the massacre showed good reason to pursue the Jan. 27 order\n\nWhat?  I still don't get it.  Do these people know it didn't happen?  If they know that and still think that's a justification for the ban...  I just...  what?  I don't even know how to respond to that.
Greasy shits.
I'm getting too old for this shit.
How could you possibly tax robots?  How do you determine what to tax them?  What do you call a robot and what do you call a machine?  Telephone operators were replaced with machines, are those machines robots?  They automated a task that was done by hand for years up to that point, should teleophone switches be taxed?  This is a ridiculous concept.  Our economy will change the more automation takes hold, we're just going to figure out how to deal with it.
> The dossier claimed it.\n\nIf I recall the dossier claimed a lot of outlandish things though.  And honestly I'm still skeptical about most of it as all we have to go with is the word of the intelligence community.  The "intelligence community" are our spies, they're by necessity shady as fuck and often have their own self-serving agenda.  Trump openly despises them and thinks he doesn't need them.  As much as I don't trust Trump and Flynn I also don't trust the intelligence community at their word on this either.\n\nI know it's easy to get carried away trying to douse the dumpster fire that is the Trump administration, and I'm not saying that this is necessarily false, but slinging _false_ accusations at the Trump administration may end up bolstering them.
Says the president who came after Obama who really _did_ inherit a mess and was able to turn it around without losing his shit.  In 2009 Obama inherited 2 wars that were going badly, the financial crisis, auto industry on the brink and we were still dealing with an overreaching CIA running black sites, extraordinary rendition and torture.  Disagree with Obama all you want on politics, but he led us out of these messes and they're likely things you don't even think about anymore.
I don't understand how the sport can be so infected with this bullshit.  Shouldn't the refs or the league or something just smack the shit out of players who try this?  WTF.
I think objects with a CanvasRenderer component have to be a child object of a canvas to be rendered.
> she would definitely get the Darwin award here\n\nI don't think you know what Darwin awards are.
That is bad-ass.
Well what do we know about that?  We know FISA warrants were applied for and denied and there are unconfirmed reports that they were eventually approved, but they're _unconfirmed reports_.  You really don't know anything either, none of us do, but you're pretending to anyway.  TYPING IN ALL CAPS doesn't make statements more true.\n\nWe should be caring about what is actually true, not finding things that support what we think is true and never questioning them.
*survived a catastrohpic mechanical failure of an antique fighter plane that's extremely difficult to land under normal conditions, let alone with no power on a golf course.
Wow, that's shocking.  Is there _no_ strain relief on this cord?  Normally a cord like this will be soldered to the board then routed around 2 posts molded into the plastic in a kind of S pattern so that if the cord is yanked this takes the strain instead of the solder joints.  This is like product design 101, even cheap, budget stuff gets strain relief and this mouse cost $80?  This really shouldn't have happened.\n\nBut anyway, the pins are labeled on the PCB and it appears that the image /u/imhotep4 is correct.  You should probably use solider wick or a solder sucker to clean up the pads and get them ready for solder again.  At that point it's just a matter of soldering them back to the pads.  However, if you haven't soldered before then you may want to find something to practice on.  Soldering isn't something most people just figure out how to do correctly on the first try.  There are a lot of counter-intuitive things when it comes to soldering that can really mess you up.  You might want to look around for someone to do this for you.  Look for hacker spaces in your area, colleges or technical schools that do electrical engineering, HAM radio guys, etc.  It's not impossible, I don't want to discourage you, but if you know someone who can solder this is literally a 2 minute fix and it'll just be way easier for them to do it.
No, absolutely not.
Staring at about:blank wondering what to do now.
Because no one was talking about Trump's conflicts of interest in this thread?
I remember hearing about these in the 90's and, having no way to actually investigate, was reasonably convinced they were real.
The camera _was_ on the lander, it was taken with a camera in one of the equipment storage bays on the side of the lunar descent module.  It could be extended and turned on from inside the lunar module specifically to get this shot.\n\nAs for how they recovered the footage of the lander taking off, there is this thing called "television" that works by the magic of "radio."  That was actually a servo-controlled camera on the lunar rover being controlled remotely from someone at mission control.\n\nYou might think these are clever "gotchas" but no...  they're really not.
Everyone there looks badass.  And then there's Britain.
You can't possibly think that $600,000 for a 20 minute speech (or whatever it was) to someone who is at this time a private citizen but was surely about to be the president of the united states is a completely normal thing.  Nope, nothing to see here, perfectly normal transaction between private citizens.  They certainly didn't want anything in return for that money at all.\n\nClinton's ties with people who have paid her large sums of money as well as large donors to her charity would have colored all her actions as president.  We would have always wondered if every little action was repaying some donor or whether every minor appointment is someone's nephew.  So while they weren't "I give you money and you do this specific thing for me" bribes...  yeah, they kind of were bribes, at least enough where I wouldn't be comfortable saying "they weren't bribes."\n\nThough a minorly flawed candidate is better than a dumpster fire used car salesman we have now.
RAM was very expensive, you didn't put it in the cartridge or else games would have cost $150 each.  _Some_ games had extra RAM in the cartridge along with the ROM.
It appears that's exactly what's happening.  Also, he appears to be tweeting _during_ the briefing.
I don't think Trump brought the term "fake news" into the modern lexicon, it was used by the media itself to describe the actual fake news being spread on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Stuff like the pope endorsing Trump that was just blatantly false.  Trump just uses the word when he has no response to an article.  "Oh, you criticized me?  You are fake news."  It's about as effective as delegitimizing the press as a fly swatter is at repelling bears.  Everyone can see him flailing and lashing out in childish and ridiculous ways, only his most hardcore and deluded supporters actually put stock into most of the media being "fake news."
[No it isn't](https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trump-National-Securi_Hera-1.jpg).
Yeah, that's the start I picked first as well.  Sounded cool, but you apparently live in blackreach and cannot leave your house or you will be killed.  Great...  I think they could have thought that start out a bit better.
He's right though, the _fake news_ media is a problem.  The amount of actual fake news we say on Reddit and Facebook during the election almost certainly skewed the votes in his favor.  That's not what he meant but he's unintentionally correct, the second best type of correct.
Oh yeah, third+ hand information channeled through Moby is a reliable source.  We really don't need more speculation right now.
I've been reading this subreddit nearly every day for a long time now.  You can't help but gawk at a trainwreck.
Was giant Obama busy?  Why is he meeting with regular Obama?
I thought retailers loved self-checkouts?  One cashier can watch all 6, people are a bit slow at them but it's still like 3 register lines for the price of 1.\n\nAs for the huge amount of closed checkout lines, they're only there for the really busy days.  It's a huge waste of space, but if on your busiest day you need 15 lines open you kind of need all 15 there all the time.
not gonna lie I just felt my dick twitch just a little bit
who are these people? I need to make some phone calls
Jesus, calm down man, that's not even remotely what I'm saying.  It looks like this is possibly true, but _I care about what is actually true_ and so should other people.  Almost every article I read on any of this is based on unconfirmed reports, unnamed sources, etc.  In other words, the media doesn't know either.  If you read past the headlines they straight up tell you "we don't know either."  But this is Reddit, people don't read past the headlines.\n\nI'm also not saying the media are liars.  _If you read past the headlines_ they detail what they know and how they know it.  When talking about the FISA warrants the articles I read were careful to point out that while they have reliable sources that tell them the FISA warrants were applied for an denies, they have _unconfirmed reports_ that they were eventually approved.  They don't know, I don't know, you don't know, none of us know.  TYPING IN ALL CAPS doesn't make what you're saying any more true.  So what did the BBC confirm and where did they confirm it?\n\nAlso, what?  Who is "we people?"
Hmm..  you're right.  Enjoy your downvote.
You seem to be reading an awfully lot into a glance at a piece of paper.  Maybe he's thinking "oh shit, did I just say his name wrong?" and after a glace at the paper thinks "phew, nope, got that right."  It could be anything, yet here you are assuming he can't remember the name of the position he's appointing him to and has to look it up?  How do you come to that conclusion?
Oh wow, I have a couple that were flickering.  I think I still actually have them, I never even thought of trying to exchange them.
He was a 64 year old man in a stressful job.  The life expectancy for Russian males is 65.9 years.  There's nothing that could lead any of us to conclude at this point that he was murdered.  Can we stop pretending like we have a finger on the pulse of a grand Russian conspiracy and start taking stock of what we actually know?  Comments like this are counterproductive.\n\nThis is kind of a disturbing trend in Reddit.  Reddit has always been very much a hive-mind, but with serious issues facing us it seems that so many people are drinking the kool-aid virtually turning the entire site into conspiracy theories and is a bit worrying.  I get it, most redditors are headline readers, gif viewers and video watchers, but this is important shit.\n\nAll I'm saying is we should look at what we know and not what we suspect.  It's not outside the realm of possibility that Putin had him killed, though I see no reason why he would do that.  But we don't know, so how about we stop pretending that we do?  /r/conspiracy is that way, they're experts at drinking kool-aid.
I must have been in the 7th or 8th grade when someone asked a question in science class.  She said something like "if it gets hotter the closer you are to the equator, shouldn't it be like 400 or 500 degrees there?  How do people live there?"  This is someone who would go on vacation of the Caribbean multiple times throughout the school year, it's not like she hadn't been _to_ the tropics.
Wow, there's a meme I haven't heard in a very long time.
No no no, this one goes there, that one goes there, right?
Reddit is partially funded by Reddit gold.  I can't find any recent info, but until recently Reddit wasn't even profitable.
Ow, my brain.
Lies, the 2600 has 128 bytes of memory, plenty to do all kinds of stuff.
Did he hit the ball twice?  Is that legal?
Hey look, an actual use for a 3D TV.  You know...  one person watching TV and someone else playing a game on the same display is pretty cool. Anyone else in the room is kinda screwed and at least one of you will need headphones, but can you actually use a 3D TV for this?
Is this...  a slaughterhouse five reference?
Yeah, but when do we get holodecks?
All cell phones are actually required to have them.  FM radio is one of the most important ways to distribute emergency information.  As cell phones replaced FM radios in homes and cars, the FCC required all phones to have FM radios, I don't think you can pass FCC spec without an FM radio.  However, because the FCC and lawmakers are idiots or corrupt there's nothing that says they have to be enabled.  Cell companies straight up don't want a competing content platform on their devices so they're doing everything they can to prevent the FM radios from being enabled.
He did better when his raft was made of luggage.
Yeah, well, I still can't find that.  There are two FISA warrants being talked about.  One that originated in June/July and finally approved in October targeting Russian banks and another targeting international communications to Trump campaign staffers that was denied and _rumored to_ have been later approved.  Things get confused here as there's little information about any of this and these _may_ refer to the same warrants.  However all we have are rumors that was was a warrant, we don't know if it even targets Trump staffers directly, we don't know the findings of that warrant and a warrant is smoke, not fire.  This is the _rumor_ of smoke, that is not even remotely close to _knowing_ anything.\n\nTrump's ties to Russia likely true in my opinion but _we don't know_.  Attacking Trump with false accusations that don't stick is probably going to have the opposite of the intended effect.  Circlejerking on reddit thinking the whole thing is cracked open and ranting and raving that anyone who dares question it thinks the media are "liberal jew run liars" as you put it does absolutely nothing, and it seems as if virtually everyone on Reddit does this.\n\nI'm just asking what we _know_ and how do we know it?  Is this really true?  I don't know, you don't know, I'm waiting for more information.
> Is it theoretically possible to see a creature walking on a planet in another galaxy?\n\nAbsolutely not.  The number of photons reflecting from that creature are minute, the number that reflect in the precise direction to hit the telescope lens over the exposure time is likely 0.  Even if you could focus on something that small, somehow, things would be too dim to see.
> What the fuck is wrong with your President?\n\nNot much in this particular instance.  He could take a hard stance and veto the bill, but it already passed both the house and the senate with a pretty big margin.
And how much did that just cost us?  There are so many private planes in Florida, how often is this going to happen?
This is what happens when you make huge, sweeping changes without understanding the implications or have a plan to clean up your own mess.
You forgot the stacks of cash being thrown away.
Trump does this on purpose, I'm sure.  If there's an appointment to be made, find the worst person for the job.  Either someone so incredibly unqualified that you're left scratching your head why he's appoint that person, or someone with such incredible conflicts of interest that you're left dumbfounded.  Has he made a single sensible appointment?
When Flynn resigned I headed over to T\\_D and...  nothing.  Nothing on the front page at all.  A few hours later, still nothing.  If you head over to the new page you see things being posted, but they get removed as quickly as they are posted.  It wasn't until the next day that anything showed up, and of course it was nonsensical.  They were _laughing_ at the situation because Flynn was a democrat, they were saying that the media forced him out and they accidentally "ate one of their own."  Haha, what incompetent fools.  Well, in T\\_D-ese that's "what a bunch of cucks."  That was their response to Flynn resigning, so yeah, they're not going to set a little thing like golf get in their way.
They're still on about this too.  Every day, every piece of news that has to do with pedophilia at all is related and "the story is about to crack wide open."
Why are these things only working from the perspective of the camera and not the person?  Maybe because..  they don't exist?
HTTP responses include a header called Content-Disposition that tells the browser what the server intends the file to be used for.  The default value is **inline**, meaning the file is intended to be consumed inside the browser.  If this header is changed to **attachment** it indicates the browser should download the file instead.  Flickr likely has a download link which generates a header like this, and this is what was linked to.
I thought she was obnoxious and got rid of her.  She was added in the enhanced edition anyway, she's not part of the original game.
This is completely unrelated rant but fuck these autoplaying videos.  I've already scrolled down by the time it actually plays, it scared the _shit_ out of me because I was watching a movie and had the headphones up loud and to top it off the video isn't anything.  It's a slideshow with a few quotes, why is it even there?  I hate sites that do this, _why do you do this?_
USPS takes theft very seriously though.  Stealing mail is a federal crime as well, it would be a big risk stealing that box.  Again, I'm sure it's possible that it was stolen, but theft sounds highly unlikely here.  Especially since it's a "giant 22lb box."\n\nI just don't see how you're jumping to that conclusion.  And also assuming that the USPS is lying to you and manufacturing plausible deniability?  That's just paranoid.  I know you're pissed off but you're not thinking clearly here.\n\nFirst off, why would someone risk stealing a bigass box of SNES games?  They're valuable to a rather small market and to everyone else they're worthless pieces of plastic.  There are electronics and jewelry and much more valuable and salable things being shipped, not to mention smaller things.  Who in their right mind would steal a box of SNES games?\n\nSecond, if they stole the box why would they leave the label?  Getting that box off the floor is going to be hard enough, taking the extra time to rip half the box off, potentially spilling the contents since they have no idea how it's packed is just silly.  Then they have to get out of the building with the box, and I'm sure no one is going to notice them walking around with a bigass box of SNES games.\n\nIsn't it just much more likely that a machine ate the box?  Who packed the box?  Was it properly packed is a good, solid box with lots of tape?  I've gotten things that were pretty mangled and they're smaller, easier to ship boxes before.  Shipping is not a gentle process, packages get tumbled down conveyor belts, shoved through, jostled, crammed together, tossed into piles, tossed into trucks, etc.  _Packages get damaged every day_, jumping to the conclusion that it was stolen isn't reasonable.  It's a remote possibility at best.
He was referring to a different poll.  There is no one official number for approval ratings, it's all based on surveys and there are multiple companies doing these surveys.
I read that 3 times and didn't catch the word "hat."  I thought you were trying to super-glue your rabbit back together.
Until you put it on a piece of paper and now it's a cock.
You should try Spunow.
It's worse than that, the piece was about Sweden's ongoing problem with migrants.  It wasn't about an event happening _right now_, yet he said it was happening "last night."  It's entirely possible he not only swallowed what he saw on Fox News whole with absolutely zero effort to fact check, but he also didn't even understand what he was watching.
Yes, there probably would be enough light reflecting off that grapefruit to be able to see it but to focus on something that small that close to us you'd need a ridiculously large telescope.  Something with a lens or mirror tens of meters across.  Most telescopes aren't designed to focus on something so close, this telescope's only real purpose would be to observe the moon and, ironically, probes like the LRO would be cheaper.\n\nThe telescope in this article is a radio telescope though, it doesn't "see" visible light.  The grapefruit on the moon part was to demonstrate the smallest area of the sky it could focus on, 50 microarcseconds.
It's not like congress just _stops_ if something else is going on.  Many bills get introduced all the time, there's nothing unusual about this.
I did search for it, I couldn't find it.  The only ones I could find were talking about the FISA warrants in October said they applied for the warrant, were denied and and there were unconfirmed reports that they were approved later.  That's all I could find.  This is the same information I'm seeing repeated in every article about this.\n\n> The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The FISA court turned down the application, asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation.\n\nSo where is the article where the BBC actually confirms this?  If that's true, I'd really like to see it.
Those aren't real religions though.  This is christianity so it's a good thing, nothing bad could possibly come of it.
The plot of The Time Machine was actually the complete opposite of our situation.  There society split into two very distinct groups, the upper class and the working class.  The upper class lived in luxury and the working class lived underground and did everything.  It went on so long the lower class became subterranean monsters that ate the upper class for food or something, I dunno, after the social commentary it goes off the rails a bit.\n\nBut then there's Star Trek where no one needs to work.  Not only is everything automated, there are replicators that can give you anything you want for free.  That's closer to what we're seeing today with automation, though taken to an extreme.
It comes in a box?  I'm confused.
We had an old couch in our basement that was the dog's couch.  Every morning we'd give the dog a handful of these multi-colored dog biscuits, but he'd take them into the basement and eat them.  We didn't find out until years later that he was hiding the green ones in the couch, there must have been 200 green dog biscuits in there.  I don't think he liked the green ones.
> Larry the Cable Guy's minimum speaking fee\n\nLarry the Cable Guy isn't in government, his decisions don't effect the lives of millions.  He doesn't disburse taxpayer money, he doesn't decide on policy for the entire nation.  I don't want public officials taking $200,000 _per speech_ fees, it isn't appropriate.  And yes, she wasn't a public official then but she knew she was running and she chose to continue taking the money anyway.  It was her choice to taint herself this way.
Trump plays olympic level mental gymnastics.  Unfortunately for us he's a limbo player but he's supposed to be competing in the high jump.
If it's a cheap door it may be cheaper to get a new one than hire someone to fix it.  Or fix it yourself.
I don't know, that's not necessarily bullshit.  Machines do eat packages and if there was an inner box is may be sitting in a bin somewhere with all the other lost and undeliverable mail.  And it may not be sitting right next to the box, the box could be way, way down the line and the label was stuck in a machine and not even pulled out for hours or days later.  I just wouldn't jump straight to theft here is all.  It could be, but probably not.
Sshh, this is Reddit, you don't point out things like that.  When I point out that the only people confirming this is the intelligence community and all we have is their word to go on at this point, I get downvoted viciously.  The "intelligence community" are our spies, they're shady as fuck because that's what spies are.  Trump openly despises them, they have 100 reasons to not want Trump and I wouldn't put it past them to lie, tell half-truths and put forward raw unverified intelligence to try to get rid of Trump.  I'm going to have to see a little more evidence than "the intelligence community says so" or in this case even less than that.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm also not a Trump supporter, I'm the furthest thing from it but I care about what is actually true, something it seems virtually none of Reddit does.  Anti-trump?  Get this to the front page!  Read the article?  Naw, I read the headline, it supports my views so I just upvote.  In a way a lot of Reddit is as bad as T\\_D in how easily they'l delude themselves and just swallow anything that supports their views.\n\nWe also can't afford to go after Trump with _false_ accusations.  What if this Russia connection was a single conversation between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and there was no _actual_ wrongdoing?  Going after Trump with that will only strengthen him if he survives it.  I have no idea if this is the case but neither does anyone else here _or_ the press and I'm not just going to jump down the rabbit hole with everyone else.
For awhile I liked FNM but who ever I was using at the time seemed like their animations were slow. Right now I use toty Cameron Wake but I kinda want to get JPP and Haley and Dareus to get the pass rusher chems going
Hey asshole I can vote for whoever the fuck I want to in Texas, my vote doesn't matter where I live. Your condescension towards people who are to the left of you and more progressive than you isn't doing anybody any favors except making you feel good about yourself.
I am :)
I can't stop reading T\\_D, I still go there every day even though I filtered it from /r/all.  I was genuinely curious as to how they'd react to this, but I didn't see much.  Threads were being deleted left and right, for _hours_ after the news broke there was just absolutely nothing, completely silence.  Today I took a peek and say only two posts on the front page.\n\n* One called the Flynn disaster "the media eating its own" because Flynn is a democrat.  The media forced him out, he did nothing wrong, it's all the media, the media, the media.  And how hilarious is it that the media forced a Democrat out of the white house?  Top kek, what a bunch of cucks, that sort of thing.  That is just...  what?  These people are on a different planet.\n* The other is just a picture of Flynn calling him a patriot.  Again, doublespeak from another planet.\n\nThey're obviously handling this in what they see is a controlled manner, but as far as I can see the trumpets are still eating it up.  Either no one is saying anything different or they have people working 24/7 to check _every single comment_ and delete the ones they don't like.
Why the fuck don't we just move president's day to election day and call it democracy day or something?
He specifically referenced [the Rasmussen poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_feb16).\n\n> The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Thursday shows that 55% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance. Forty-five percent (45%) disapprove.\n\n
So basically if you're a potato then you're just fucked, better give up now.  So motivational.
But where does the magic blue smoke come from?
I solved this using a double linked list using a single pointer member variable.  This is a more compact way of doing a double linked list that I suppose was useful at some point in history, now I don't think the extra 4 or 8 bytes are really worth it unless you're dealing with lists millions or billions of items long.\n\nVisualizing what's going on here is a bit counter-intuitive at first.  Every node N has a pointer called **links** which is equivalent to **prev ^ next**.  If you're iterating forward, to get the pointer to the next node you simply say **links ^ prev**.  But you can just as easily do the same and say **links ^ next** to get the prev pointer.  This is a symmetrical action, so iterating a list in the reverse direction is the same exact operation.  To reverse the list just iterate from the tail using the same exact function.\n\nThe problem with linked list code is it just gets so...  confusing.  It's like this awkward whack-a-mole of pointers when it comes to doing things like reversing.  Using this solution which, again, is a double linked list so maybe it's "cheating" the code to reverse the list is the same as the code to iterate the list.\n\n\t#include <iostream>\n\t#include <string>\n\t#include <functional>\n\t#include <cstdint>\n\t#include <cassert>\n\tusing namespace std;\n\n\tstruct Node\n\t{\n\t\tint data;\n\t\tNode* links;\n\t};\n\n\tNode* push_node(Node* n, int i)\n\t{\n\t\tassert(n);\n\n\t\tauto newNode = new Node{ i, n };\n\t\tn->links = (Node*)((uintptr_t)n->links ^ (uintptr_t)newNode);\n\t\treturn newNode;\n\t}\n\n\tNode* create_linked_list(size_t size)\n\t{\n\t\tauto n = new Node{ (int)--size, nullptr };\n\t\twhile (size != 0)  n = push_node(n, --size);\n\t\treturn n;\n\t}\n\n\tNode* next_node(Node* p, Node* n)\n\t{\n\t\treturn (Node*)((uintptr_t)n->links ^ (uintptr_t)p);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid iterate_linked_list(Node* n, std::function<void(Node*)> f)\n\t{\n\t\tNode* p = 0;\n\n\t\twhile (n)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tf(n);\n\t\t\tauto tmp = next_node(p, n);\n\t\t\tp = n;\n\t\t\tn = tmp;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tvoid print_linked_list(Node* n, ostream& out = cout)\n\t{\n\t\titerate_linked_list(n, [&out](Node* n)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tout << n->data;\n\t\t});\n\t\tout << endl;\n\t}\n\n\tNode* reverse_list(Node* n)\n\t{\n\t\tNode* newN;\n\t\titerate_linked_list(n, [&newN](Node* n)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tnewN = n;\n\t\t});\n\n\t\treturn newN;\n\t}\n\n\tint main()\n\t{\n\t\tNode* n = create_linked_list(10);\n\t\tprint_linked_list(n);\n\n\t\tn = reverse_list(n);\n\t\tprint_linked_list(n);\n\n\t\treturn 0;\n\t}
> Care to take a guess as to why it's suddenly this hugely inappropriate thing to do?\n\nNone of those people apart from Hillary Clinton went _back_ into politics.  Paying a former president or first lady huge speaking fees is fine, the issue is that Clinton took the fees and didn't leave politics, she became a senator, secretary of state and presidential candidate.  It's inappropriate for anyone in those positions (or between those positions) to be taking huge speaking fees.  How can anyone reasonably not expect any sort of quid pro quo?  Like I said it's not a straight up bribe, but it colors everything should would have done as president, we would have always been left wondering if this executive action or that appointment was influenced by money.
That's what I did.  I didn't play Morrowind back in the day (I still had a 486 at that time, something tells me I wouldn't be able to run it) and recently played it in 2016.  If you ignore the graphics and the frustrating dice rolling combat, it's a way better game.  You feel much more interested in the world, the quests seem to be much more designed.\n\nBeing forced to actually read the dialog and not blindly follow quest markers is a _huge_ boon.  It sounds like it would be terrible, but you get used to it quickly and it really does add a lot to the game.  "Follow the road south, then climb over the mountains to get to the swamp.  There, find me 4 specific mushrooms."  It's just a fetch quest, but not having a quest marker and the 10 lines of dialog you read to get to that add so much.  Now, because every line of dialog has to be voiced they're not going to put in 10 lines about how some cat person in the basement needs some mushrooms.  You end up not caring, following the quest marker to the thing and doing something, I usually forget why I'm even there, and going back for your reward.  It's just...  nothing, I could pay more attention but Skyrim doesn't really reward me for it.\n\nAnother thing that was really great about Morrowind is that you can't win ever encounter.  Skyrim is level scaled, you basically can't lose.  You can't wander into a dungeon (except a few hidden away) and encounter enemies that will absolutely trash you.  There's no real sense of danger, you don't have to think your way around any situations.  For example, in Morrowind there's a spell that locks doors.  I needed something from a crypt that had ghosts way too powerful for me to fight, but they're kind of slow.  So I lure it into a chamber, run out and lock the door behind me.  I can't think of a single instance where I could have even solved something like that, everything is just murder murder murder and everything is just your level.\n\nAnd the spells...  that lock spell?  I thought it would be fun to roleplay locking the inn door behind me while I slept.  So I lock the door, save the game and go to bed.  I can't unlock the door.  I'm stuck, I don't have an unlock spell.  I can cast levitate and fly all over the place, but I don't have any way of landing safely if it runs out.  Magic is actually interesting, magic in Skyrim is just..  95% attack spells and a few illusion, armor or healing spells.  It was _boring_.  Magic in Morrowind might be imbalanced, possibly game-breaking, but it's so much more interesting.\n\nNo, I think Morrowind is an objectively better game and it's not just nostalgia talking.
Not going to happen.  The F-35 is replacing the A-10, F-16, F/A-18 and the AV-8B.  We don't have next gen planes to replace those, canceling the F-35 now and extending the life of those planes will put our military back 20 years.  Should there be a war with a major power we'll be at a serious technological disadvantage and that definitely matters.
In February?  Nope.
Well I am currently poor with only 20k in coins to spend so I'll just have to wait on the freebies I suppose. I guess that will mean I wont' be able to turn as good of a profit as that but I hope I make at least 100k from it
I really like McCaffrey, I've got him fully chem'd at 95 ovr and he is awesome. It's almost a guaranteed touchdown every time if he runs a corner route and the defense is in man coverage
> Politicians can’t have it both ways. Either big money is off-limits, or it’s not. Right now, it’s not, so it’s hypocritical for people like Rove to say “stop” to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees and “go” to money from the same source for his political action committee.\n\nCan't I say stop to both?  But the speaking fees aren't a PAC, that's personal profit directly to her bank account.  It's her money, this is not a campaign finance or PAC issue.  And you keep bringing up that she was a private citizen, yet she was planning to run for president.  All I'm saying is it's inappropriate for her to be taking so much money in that position.  Getting paid $225,000 for a 20 minute speech _3 times_ from Goldman Sachs is excessive, collectively taking in something like $50 million in speaking fees is excessive.\n\n> Also, Hillary was never President to begin with, and first lady isn't "in politics" in the normal sense\n\nShe was a senator and secretary of the state after that, and again _she knew she was going to run and accepted unusually large sums of money for 20 minute speeches_.  This is very, very suspicious.  What if she pushed for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, can any of us say she wasn't influenced?  What about the millions of dollars she collectively made speaking for virtually every large industry we have?  Would any of those have influenced her?  What about the millions of dollars donated to the Clinton Foundation, would that influence her?  All I'm saying is that's a problem, it is (or was) an issue.  I don't think we've had a presidential candidate before 2016 that personally took so much from so many groups.  It's a problem, I don't trust that that wouldn't influence her.  And it's her choice, she didn't need to take all that money.\n\n> What you're doing is twisting anything you can to try and not be wrong, but you are, so just admit it and move on, that's how adults behave.\n\nNo, I'm not.  Name one thing I have twisted.  Seriously, because someone disagrees with you they're twisting things and just won't admit they're wrong?  Is that how adults behave?
> This is propaganda now.\n\nNo, this is incompetence.  Propaganda has a purpose, propaganda knows it's false and intentionally misrepresents reality to warp public perception on an issue.  What this is is Trump being an idiot and not even being able to understand what he sees on cable news then shooting his mouth off about how informed he is.  
The front fell off.
Last time I want to K-Mart I bought one thing and was given 7 receipts.  I don't know if it was exactly 7, but it was an excessive amount of long receipts.  I thought the machine was broken but nope, everyone gets 7 receipts.  Because we all need 7 receipts.

what kind of bird is that?
Holy shit he must have tendons and ligaments made of military grade rubber. I thought for sure he would have torn something.
Elections don't matter when corporations like Raytheon, Halliburton, Boeing, General Electric and Lockheed can just buy all of the politicians to keep the war machine chugging along. Obama didnt get us out of any wars, in fact he expanded our wars. Hillary would have escalated what we were already doing in Syria and possibly escalate with Russia as well. Get money out of politics and you fix the problem.
that's that red raider spirit coming through
Hey knucklehead we've been the baddies since the end of World War II. Remember how we invaded Vietnam on a lie? Remember when we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan on a lie? Death Squads in South America? Overthrowing the Shaw of Iran? Have you seen how we are aiding and abetting Saudi Arabia in war crimes against Yemen? You gotta start paying attention, Donny TinyHands simply ripped the papered over imperialistic rot that is our government.
I can't tell if you're to the left of him or if you're a Blair-ite... How has he ruined the party exactly?
"worth it"-that guy, probably
I wish I knew a place to get something like this in the middle of BFE Texas, I need to go back to England soon so I can indulge in this delicious breakfast
it's definitely worth, it takes a little more time to set up with this madden compared to last year but ive already made 140k by transferring my 92 ovr team over, selling off the season stars items and doing 2/3 of the December gauntlet yesterday
Is this going to be the full length version of [Pigman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tVOqZIC8qU)
THERE WAS A CONTRACT SALE?!
how long did you allow this to continue?
It would have been better under Bernie because he would have had zero incentive to keep the war machine going because he wasn't taking legal bribes from the military industrial complex.
the advantage of transferring the whole squad over is to get the free 36k and packs for increasing your ovr.
That is unless the next incoming president is Barack Obama who doesn't want to prosecute crimes that "happened in the past" (In reference to CIA torturers). I bet all of the people in jail right now feel so stupid for committing their crimes in the future!
Oh yeah I read the mothman book a couple times actually, that was spooky
oh i thought he was talking about something recent
With the lack of solos available I think Im just gonna do farm accounts that way I can keep making coins and always have solos to grind. Its a pain in the ass to switch all of your players over but its worth it
Thats excellent news
I like making elite playbooks with the badges I get, those can net you a good amount of coins really quick
RIP didn't get anything good, gonna condense all of the non-elites into elite badges for QS packs to try and make my coins back lmao
but it's golf... not exactly bone crunching, hard hitting action
"H-he's just trying to do a fancy no-look snap catch, no need for concussion protocol here!"- Coach, probably
132k on 15 QS packs RIP
It's back at the Gaylord??? When are tickets supposed to go on sale?
they are always the 4 toughest games of your online madden career
thanks for sharing this, now I can really cheese the AI when I'm trying to grind solos in mut
toty Hill is great, super fast
damn I love Jeremy Corbyn, that guy is a fighter. I would love to know what he said there.
Ohhh so you mean like neoliberals? The people that smeared the most progressive senator in the country and his supporters as sexist "Bros" and racists? That makes sense, I should use alt-left in that context more often. I got called an alt-left dudebro once by this jagoff who thinks he's gonna primary Bernie in 2018. Didn't really make sense when he called me that.
good, well hopefully they will be able to at least double the number of BYOC tickets they can sell since theyre moving to the new venue. I havent been in a few years due to missing the day to buy tickets/people not able/wanting to go.
I havent played this game in a long time but the memes on this sub are always A1
If you want to learn more about Syria, the Jimmy Dore Show and Secular Talk have great videos that explain what's really going on over there. The TV news outlets lie and distort what's really going on all the time.
that's too bad, I thought the draft format made it more fun
3 more pro packs from mut tips, 55 bronze player turn in packs, 35 silver player turn in packs, 20 gold player turn in packs, 19 team item turn in packs.
That part you mentioned about stability is so damn true and that goes for any football coach at any level. When you start messing with that you're just asking for mediocrity. That's why the Browns will never be good until they keep a coach for longer than 1 season.
Probably wasn't the best idea for democratic operatives to blame the election loss on fake news? Donny TinyHands can now just say whatever makes him look bad is fake news.
Same, sent messages to mods and never got an answer back even after the election. Ended up making a new reddit account just so I could post again in all of the "lefty" subs I was banned from for not bending the knee to The Queen.
This is a tragedy, he was my favorite play-by-play guy across all sports. He IS the voice of college football for me, I would watch games he would call even if I had no interest in the game that was being played.

I would buy one if I were you, they just recently upgraded the chrome player after it had been broken for what seemed like years. I havent used it much recently but it seems to have fixed a lot of problems that I was having with even the fire fox player.
I've been thinking about getting that same exact D-line, how has that been working out for you? Do you feel like they get good pressure on their own or do you have to user one of them?
don't blame "the left" on Hillary losing to a maternal orangutan on cocaine. That's all on her, not Jill Stein voters whom she made no effort to court.
That would be my hope that they increase the number of available seats, the Gaylord is freakin huge with tons of ballrooms that can be utilized.
Trump drained the swamp and by God he found his cabinet at the bottom of it
I want a 99 ovr Randy Gregory with 2x puff puff pass rush chem
"The" and "the sole" are not the same statement. It's a little ambiguous but nobody likes a pedant.
Doesn't matter how much money it was. If I gave you $2,000 for anything I'd expect you to at least think twice before crossing me. And I refuse to take your defeatist position that, "welp gotta be bought by the same special interests as Republicans cuz money =  win." Wrong. Money does not equal win. Hillary Clinton outspent Donny Tinyhands 2-1 and she STILL lost. A lady in my state of Texas got 49% of the vote against a Republican who was running in a district that is gerrymandered 60-40 Republican. If you have the right message and raise money from the people, you have a chance no matter where you are.
Hopefully this means they have a chance at beating those right-wing nutjobs in the the national front
>4 years from now\n\nI dont think he makes it past year 2, if they dont nail him with these Russia investigations I'm sure he'll find some other way to get impeached. He's a serial bungler, no way he lasts the full term.
yeah I'm not saying it isn't, but the people that normally read Breitbart were never going to vote for a democrat anyway. There wasn't some guy in Ohio that was like on the fence between the two and decided his vote based on some Breitbart article.
I voted Green because I am against war. I did not vote for HRC.
This is where neoliberalism has left us... blue collar working guys like him worshiping cardboard cutouts of a fake billionaire fascist conman
Nah, moms are way worse about that stuff
I want it just for the dumb Manning face he's making lmao
Dez throwing up the X
what the hell is the alt-left? thats not even a thing
I think it's getting better, my mom just got a new iPhone 7 and her voice on that phone is a night and day difference from her old iphone 4 she had previously.
well that part is free it just takes hard work and a shovel
No, but it created zero enthusiasm for his opponent which allowed him to win. Think it through.
good things come to those who wait, patience my young padawan learner
Where did I say we were better off with Donny TinyHands? I'm just pointing out that Hillary was no prize either as far as foreign policy goes, which is more war and more funding of terrorist groups and countries that sponsor terrorism.

It's not a quid pro quo because we didnt catch it on film that Mnuchin personally gave her a briefcase with 2 grand in it, but anybody with 2 brain cells can see that there is influence being bought here. Why is it that none of the bankers on Wall Street went to jail after committing fraud on a massive scale and crashed our economy? It is because they have bought the politicians on both sides, even your little favorite Kamala Harris. I only support democrats that don't take corporate donations. justicedemocrats.com
>moderate rebels\n\nHow does one "moderately rebel?" The CIA is aiding Al Qaeda and other terror groups to fight the Assad government. People in Syria hate the Assad government, but they hate the "moderate rebels" even worse because they're radical outsiders who aren't even Syrian in many cases. Civilians don't want to live under control of these "moderate rebels" who in reality are jihadists. Learn more about Syria by following Rania Khalek on twitter, a journalist that has actually been on the ground in Syria.
I think that was my last one too, I barely got my tickets in time
>I just can't stand the people on the left\n\nI feel you dude, I'm as left as they come but I hate all the PC identity politics crap. People that buy into the faux outrage crap are dupes. It's used as a distraction from all the bullshit our government is doing to fuck us all over.
They ran 5 negative articles on Bernie for every positive article they ran. They are not liberal, they are not progressive, they are the establishment. They were bordering on fake news status during the primary. I take any criticism they have of a progressive and throw it directly in the sewer where it belongs.
It looks like Spaceman Spiff
Perhaps the NFL has a tight relationship with the pharmaceutical industry as well as the alcohol industry. Both of those lobbies hate pot and try everything in their power to keep the laws the same.
You get money out of politics by getting a Constitutional Amendment to clean up our elections. wolf-pac.com. The Supreme Court is the entity that has allowed our politicians to become bought, the only thing that is above the Supreme Court is amending the constitution. And I bring up Hillary because she literally said she wanted a no-fly-zone in Syria which means military escalation that would require shooting down Russian/Syrian planes. Not to mention her track record with Iraq and Libya. I bring up Hillary because she is supposed to be a democrat, you know, the party that is supposed to be against war?
any defensive tips you'd like to share? I feel like I'd actually have a shot at winning a super bowl if I could just get stops/turnovers more often
Yeah right now I've got totw sean lee toty paul p and milestone barron but I never see him actually on the field because I use the cowboys 4-3. And when you say make adjustments do you mean like pick different defensive plays or like actual adjustments at the line? I've tried watching youtube vids of people setting up blitzes and stuff but with all the steps involved it seems impossible to do before the opponent snaps the ball
Yeah I'm glad its later too, I think my graduation date is August 18th so I should be able to make it this year
yeah if I had to bet money I'd say we would get swept, but hey we've seen some crazy stuff happen in sports over the last 365 days so I guess anything is possible.
I figured this out pretty quickly when I was a freshman at a catholic high school, I was like hmmm interesting how they only serve fish/shrimp on Fridays at school and now all of the fast food places are serving fish sandwiches too
I live in Texas so not really. I'm just saying that lack of enthusiasm for HRC and neoliberal policies are what lead to Trump. People were sick of the shit.
I really don't want to make the playoffs... but man wouldn't it be fun if we got revenge on Golden State for what happened in 2007?
Part of the issue is that the drone bombing campaigns [kill the 90% the wrong people.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilian-deaths-drone-strikes_us_561fafe2e4b028dd7ea6c4ff) This causes survivors of the strike to become vulnerable to radicalization. Let's say you're a young man in your late teens or early 20's and you're walking home from the store. You are about a block away and you see a missile hit your house instantly killing everyone inside. Your mother, your father, your siblings, your cousin and both of your grandparents are now dead. You sort through the rubble and you find a fragment of the missile casing and it says, "made in the USA." This fills you with anger, you wish to seek revenge but you don't know how to go about it. You had always heard about ISIS and thought they were crazy and evil, but now you have nothing to live for except revenge so you decide to join them anyway to get back at those who killed your family. 
So we need to invade every country that has a bad dictator? So when are we going to invade Saudi Arabia? Are you sure you aren't mixing this sub up with the neocon sub? We can't get clean water to Flint or healthcare for everyone or pay every worker a living wage, but we can afford to stay at war for 15+ years? And tell me, who rose up in place of Saddam Ghadafi once we killed them? ISIS.
chills just thinkin about it
"less punitive"? Shit, they shouldn't even test for it in the first place. I could give a fuck if a player smokes weed, I wanna see guys like Josh Gordon, Martavis Bryant and Randy Gregory play. It is so ridiculous and unscientific to punish players for using a mind altering substance that is safer than alcohol and has no positive impact on player performance (that we know of, anyway).
that was literally a millimeter away from being incomplete just like the Tyree helmet catch 10 years ago
The problem is that she never talked about those policy positions, she never ran ads about that stuff or really was able to talk about that in debates (no thanks to shitty moderators). If she had better messaging than "This guy is an asshole, vote for me" then she could have eeked out the win.
you're not that dumb, the guy who won our league had him on his bench for weeks. But he also had zero players get injured until week 17 when David Johnson went down.

There are so many great things about season 1 and thus so many reasons to have enjoyed it, a lot of these things are replicated in season 2 and in some cases surpassed in season 2 but overall I think season 2 did not succeed to the same degree as season 1.\n\nIf you loved the oppressive and dense atmosphere of season 1, you will find that in season 2, and even more so. If you aren't so much a  fan of True Detective as you are a fan of Rust then maybe skip it.

Could be. 2mg is a LOT of xanax if you aren't tolerant. Anxiety disorders usually start with a prescription of 0.25 mg so that is 8 doses. I've had breakdowns on xanax that once I sobered up I realized were about nothing. It's your body though so IDK just pointing out it could be possible.
No. If they don't give out black belts for stupid things then they only give out black belts for not-stupid things, let's call those smart things. If he never got a black belt, then he never did a smart thing, or at least a smart thing that awards black belts.
I don't think the game is as "split secondy" as you think. In this case the protoss player made a mistake by clumping his probes. If he hadn't reacted AT ALL he would have lost maybe 5-8 probes. That is hardly game losing, and if you are playing at a level where that is game losing then you would have the reaction time to negate it.\n\nBrood War had Lurkers, Reavers, Storms, Irradiate, Plague, OG Tanks, Spider Mines, etc This mechanic is nothing new.

I don't think Starcraft is on the decline so much as it's viewership didn't explode like the rest of the e-sports when watching professional gaming became more of a commonplace pastime. \n\nI think the main reason that Starcraft has not gained viewers as quickly as other games has to do with the difficulty of the game, even at a casual level.

I'm currently playing my 12th season in the Masters league, and if I may I will give you the best advice I can:\n\nChange your mindset. The point of playing on the ladder is NOT to win. It is to improve. If you can approach ladder with this mentality then every game is a success because you will always improve the more you play. If you approach the ladder thinking "I am here to win" you will have anxiety about accomplishing your goal and it is likely you will become frustrated as well. The path is calm, manners, and personal growth. The rest will come naturally.

A little about me. I played masters in WoL, I think for a total of 12 seasons, I'm too lazy to check, and then one additional season on HoTS. I want to get back into masters, I think it is a compelling enough distraction to keep me from IV drug use. However I have nobody to keep me accountable. If people are on my stream telling me to keep playing. I will! All help is appreciated!\n\nI will adapt the style of my stream as people give advice and recommendations :)
Probably don't need the word astonishing in there...
> I'm sorry, I just can't accept that there are people who would purposely seek either of these things out when alternatives are available.\n\nyeah but then there'd be no one to fuck yr mum

I think SC2 is the death rattle of this generation of RTS. RTS hasn't really changed in a long time. SC2, while being way different than Brood War is still essentially an iterative departure from Brood War, it doesn't really have anything new gameplay-wise.\n\nOnce upon a time RTS was the crown jewel of gaming. The thing is, back then gaming was a niche activity and most PC gamers were what today would be looked at as "hardcore gamers" or nerds or something. So the mechanical difficulty of RTS was a selling point not a detractor. Fast forward to current day and we have a genre that is very inaccessible to the vast majority of gamers. While the tenants of strategy, tactics and economy are something most players can understand and enjoy, the 150 apm and heavy practice required to even interact with those aspects of the gameplay turn a lot of people off to it.\n\nI think we need a paradigm shifting game. Imagine if starcraft 2 had a full set of automation tools built in. Once you made a barracks you could tell it to always make a marine if you were over 100 minerals, queens auto inject, creep spread across the map automatically. With a few simple commands your base ran itself then all you had to do was make high level strategic and economic decisions, and engage in tactical interactions with your opponent. \n\nAll of a sudden the game becomes purely about the parts of RTS we enjoy and really takes the not fun aspects and condenses them to a small fun component of play ie. setting up how your base would automate
Hey Mama
Did those games have the micro oppurtunities that sc2 does with things like disruptors, drops etc.?
I don't think you could safely buff lurkers, they are already very strong.

tldr: \n\n> Dr Luke – real name Lukasz Gottwald – wrote: “We were having a discussion on how she can be more disciplined with her diet. there have been many times we have all witnessed her breaking her diet plan. this perticular [sic] time – it happened to be diet coke and turkey while on an all-juice fast.”\n\n> Dr Luke dismissed Kesha’s request to change the words by saying: “I don’t give a shit what you want. If you were smart you would go in and sing.”\n\n> “Rather than agree to a thorough disclosure, Kesha and her representatives improperly publicised, without court permission, three out-of-context emails which do not present the full picture regarding the events they concern. For example, these emails do not show that the lyrics of Crazy Kids were, in fact, rewritten at Kesha’s request. \n\ni dunno. this case has been going on forever and I wonder if Kesha will recover from it\n\nfunny enough, regarding her weight, she's pretty chunky nowadays.  she went back to live in Nashville\n\nshrug.

The argument doesn't exist to help seniors, or veterans, or trafficking victims, of abuse victims, or the mentally ill, or whatever. The argument exists to have an excuse to deny each of these groups help by pointing somewhere else. Its the race to the bottom in action.

*ahem*\n\nSavage Oppress.
I don't see her being successful and I won't vote for her, but good luck I guess.
Oh look, there's some rocks at the edge of the map there.
They could team up. Become a dynamic dual, perhaps...
Obstructionist, needlessly micromanaging, and anti-intellectual? Yup, that's a big R.\n\nHer saving grace is that she cares about animals.
Definitely an o8 though, really.
If you're going to make claims like this I'm going to need sources.
I'm not surprised. The Jedi were known to force their child "padawans" to pair up with adults. I can only imagine what sick things the Jedi were "teaching" those poor children.
The luftwaffles can be substituted with panzercakes if desired.
She's known for being somewhat anti-intilectual. She seems to feel a need to "prove herself" against her peers who have higher levels of education. I don't think level of education disqualifies her since she has a lot of experience, but she seems to feel like that's the perception.\n\nThe problem here is that she has set herself at odds with the "East End Elites" and is generally antagonistic toward that perceived demographic. The way I see it, she'd enter a debate with that "prove herself" complex and get overshadowed by others who are more confident and frankly more knowledgeable on a number of issues. I also don't see her being well liked by much of the mayoral departments, many of which she has personally ripped into at council meetings.\n\nHer tendency to be very pointed in her lines of questioning may carry over into her responses as well, which may turn away some voters.
Yup, you're talking about Incorporated and unincorporated areas. In most states in the east coast especially in the Northeast, there are no unincorporated areas. All land is incorporated into some form of municipality. However, in a lot of the western Midwestern and larger States across the country there are unincorporated areas that are administered at the county level. If I'm not in correct, that's how things are in California.\n\nPennsylvania is a special kind of demon because consolidating municipalities is a difficult thing to do here after legislation was passed at the state level around a hundred years ago. The result is many small municipalities clinging to their power as local governing agencies in a way that makes it difficult to work across levels. There are 130 municipalities in Allegheny County alone. To complicate this further, school districts are administered at a separate level and can overlap with municipalities and even cross county lines.
Again, UPMC? Didn't this same thing happen a year or two ago?
The T is what many call the parts of the state that aren't Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. If you remove the two largest metro area the rest of the land shapes a T.

I'll urge you not to vote for her because she's "not Peduto". Review her policies, her history on council, and her demeanor throughout the years and decide on her merits if she deserves your vote. Voting for someone, not against someone else.
You're drawing a lot of false equivalencies here.
Well friend, you're thinking of A Long-Expected Party. Those are less fun. Last one I was at, the Sackville-Bagginses made off with half of the silverware! And then the host just vanished, almost like magic! 
Plugging my city: [Pittsburgh's Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Flag_of_Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania.svg) isn't too bad. 24th best (of 150) in 2004 as rated by the North American Vexillological Association. It's mostly pretty simple. \nThe tricolor is black and gold (official city colors) and the emblem is the City's coat of arms. The "Black and Gold" color scheme is shared by the City's sports teams and the official color that several of the City's iconic bridges bears is "Aztec Gold" per the City's official hues. \n\nThe coat of arms itself is a little busy, where the problems lie. The crest itself is based on that of William Pitt, First Earl of Chatham, who that city was name for. \n\nThe [variant/merchant flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Ensign_of_Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania.svg) is *way* better, imo. It preserves the blue from William Pitt's COA but drops the other very busy details of the crest.\n\nA much better flag would drop the castle entirely, which isn't based on the historic Fort Pitt as far as anyone knows, in favor of *anything* else. The tricolor is great, the problem lies in the emblem.\n
Depends on a lot of factors where I live. Newer homes, most likely. Apartments, probably. Housekeeping like mine? Not necessary. I don't have AC, even window units. My house dates to the late 1800s. The way it's built, with high cielings and tall windows, even the worst temperatures in PA are manageable by getting the air to cycle through properly. It's a bitch to heat in the winter though.
That's no neighbor. That's a rebel sympathizer. it is very important that you report this to the ISB immediately. Don't let on that you've reported him. He may already be radicalized. I'd hate to see the rebel attack a loyal citizen such as yourself with illegal improvised thermal detonators just to cover his escape. Stay vigilant and stay safe.

Technically, Helm's Deep IS the box canyon and everything inside. And I agree, looks more like Gondor on the Pelennor. 
I don't live in Hazelwood and that's interesting. I'd like to speak to more people from there about this. He's responsive where I live, but it's worrying if he's not some much for others.
An older /r/askhistorians [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2r1teh/was_there_any_international_outcry_over_the/) touches on this. The top poster cites Japan and Russia as Pacific rivals. Also consider that European countries did have possessions in the Pacific. Spain had the Philippines up until America acquired it right before the Hawaiian annexation. Britain had Australia, new Zealand, Hong Kong, and many others. France was influential in Vietnam, Cambodia, French Polynesia, and others.\n\nAfter the acquisition of the Philippines, a mid-pacific port would be valuable as a stopping point for trade and military movements. There was a lot of strategic value to Hawaii.
>The 61-year old York County trash, trucking and recycling magnet\n\nNot sure if clever pun, or misspelling of magnate.
> pre-revolution British history is also American history\n\nIn a twist, our history here in Western Pennsylvania is also French history. Although never heavily colonized, the region was part of New France until the British officially acquired it in 1762. Of course, they acquired it by beating the French...
I guarantee they've already seen this holonet discussion and will be on their way to your neighbors house soon. Don't worry, your neighbor will won't be harmed if he chooses to attend mandatory re-education classes. The Empire has always been about strengthening communities, not tearing them down.
I'm not actually disagreeing with you in any way. I was just using this as an excuse to make a French losses joke.
Skywalker was pawn in the games of others. That traitor Mon Mothma or the rogue Jedi Kenobi are certainly worse. If not for their intervention, Skywalker would have joined the Imperial Academy and likely joined his father enforcing peace for our great Emperor. It's sad to see such a life squandered.
Then we disagree. Have a nice day.
You mean to say the Hornburg. Helm's Deep is the name of the whole collection of defenses inside the valley (called the Deeping-Coomb) below the tallest northern peaks of the Ered Nimrais. At the back of the valley was the Aglarond, the glittering Caves. Around and before the Algarond was built the fortress called the Hornburg. In front of and around the Hornburg were the massive Helm's Dike (a big ditch) and the Deeping Wall, through which the Seeping-stream flowed. Helm's Deep refers to all of these things together, not just the fortress.\n\nTl'dr: You're missing a big ditch, a big wall, a stream, and the sides of a valley. Nice Hornburg though.
It think this shows a lack of understanding of familial names and their origins. In nations of immigrants (like America) it gets muddied by mixing backgrounds. While some names have roots in the (presumably male) profession of an ancestor, like Smith, Zimmerman, or Sanders, not all names are like that. I know people with surnames like Cornish (from Cornwall), Scott (from Scottland, presumably), or Deutschlander (yes, I have a friend whose name means German Person). While those names were passed on through their fathers, its likely most of those names would apply to both mother and father in a pre-American society. Here in America, surnames have lost their meanings through the mixing of our different backgrounds. I approve of neither patronymic or matronymic naming schemes, but for legal and administrative purposes, a surname has to exist.
Also some people call him Froggie and the people who say Froggy really hate the people who say Froggie.
I tell people Cincy and Pittsburgh have similarities and they think I'm crazy. Come visit, the Burgh is like that on steroids. More six-way intersections than you can shake a steel beam at.
Ah, ok. Last I heard was with the initial outbreak. I'm really surprised they didn't lock it down sooner, but at least it it's an ongoing thing right now, so far as we know.
The signature blend is the totenkopfee, served black.
Again, something I blame on Kenobi. He hid the poor boy from his own father, isolating him from that love a child deserves. Kenobi kept close watch on him to make sure he would eventually join the rebel scum. Jedi are masters of manipulation.
He's nothing more than a pirate. Rebels harrass shipping lines, gang-press Imperial citizens into fighting their unlawful insurgency, and even commandeer Imperial ships. A stolen ship flying under false flag was used to infiltrate Scarif. Rebels have no honor, and this "Admiral" is no better than a backwater pirate lord. 
I suppose you're right it's semantics.\n\nWolf's goal here appears to be finding a way to plug our budget holes, which is important since the GA doesn't want to do it. I think I'd have to see more on this issue to make a decision on how I feel.
Well, it's possible for them to be one and the same. An executioner is the executor who executes an execution. The difference though is that an executor carries out an action, while an executioner carries out a specific action. Lord Vader is the executor of our great Emperor's will. That will happens to include the execution of Rebel scum. It's a fitting name for his new flagship.
You're pretty much right on for the state, but not the county.. Allegheny's charter specifically says it "shall not limit in any way the jurisdiction, rights, powers, or autonomy of the municipal governments in the County". So If Allegheny said "everyone must wear sweaters" and Pittsburgh said "we don't have to wear sweaters", Allegheny would likely lose any court battle because the law violates their charter by limiting the powers of Pittsburgh. The county level powers exist to facilitate things between the municipalities, like Port Authority, AlcoSAN, etc. If the county consolidated, most of those things could be handled at the same level as municipal government.\n\nAs for following the state, that's pretty spot on. The [Second Class City Code](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/HTM/1901/0/0014..HTM) defines a lot of things about how the city government is formed. The [City Clerk's Office](http://pittsburghpa.gov/cityclerk/homerule) has a nice summary of Pittsburgh's Charter and defines the powers of home rule as follows:\n\n>The City of Pittsburgh has all home rule powers and may perform any function and exercise any power not denied by the Constitution, the laws of Pennsylvania, or this charter whether such powers or functions are presently available to the City or may in the future become available. The powers of the City shall be construed liberally in favor of the City, and the specific mention of particular powers in this charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general power stated in this article. All possible powers of the City, except as limited above, are to be considered as if expressly set forth in this article whether such powers are presently available to the City, or may in the future become available.\n\nThe short version: "We reserve the right to have all of the rights that we want to have except for the rights we've already been told that we don't have. Just in case, we're also including a bunch we haven't thought of yet but might think of later on because we can do that."
Weird. They wrote [the march](https://youtu.be/uDCzf-Nx9xI) for Cincinnati. 
They probably don't remember that first flood. The second and third floods may have washed away their memories.
It's a great flag, but there's no historical evidence supporting that the castle is drawn from Fort Pitt. The three gold circles are directly from William Pitt's coat of arms. The birds are a result of someone misunderstanding the word "bezant" (the gold circles) as "pheasants".
Ah yes, Bloomfield, Friendship, Squirrel Hill, Oakland, Shadyside, Swisshelm Park, Park Place, and Point Breeze, known for their high populations of non-white citizens.\n\nJK, you're an idiot.
I've never found trimming to be necessary. Cats naturally shed their old claw sheaths every couple of months. As long as they have a good scratching post, they'll have naturally healthy claws. Thing is that people declaw cats because they scratch things instead of just getting them something to scratch and training them to use it instead of the sofa, the doorjamb, etc.

Piggybacking: in many cases, it all boils down to how the municipality is chartered. The charter is the legal document that defines the municipality and it's authority as granted by the state. This can differ by state. In PA, for example, a municipality is chartered as a city, a borough, a township, or a town (there's only one town). Not all charters grant an entity home rule, however. A municipality with a home rule charter has complete control over local laws *except* where specifically defined in state law.\n\nThe cities and townships are further broken down into "classes" based on population and local government type. State law then defines what each class of municipality is allowed to self-govern. For example, only a city of the first class (there's only one, Philly) may do certain things, so second and third class cities can't do those things. Some charters may have special things that are individual to the municipality. In PA, seven counties also have home rule charters, which creates a weird tier of governments. For example, Pittsburgh is a second class home rule city within the County of Allegheny, which *also* has its own home rule charter.  \n\nSmall edit: since OP asked, PA government types vary and aren't dependent upon home rule. Example: DuBois is a City of the third class. It has a mayor-council government, but has an optional plan instead of a home rule charter.
I'm just poking fun because I love the march. Charlotte's definitely got the fairer weather right now and is on my visiting list.
You certainly are not dumb, noble citizen. Any loyal Imperial citizens are smartly on the right side in this unfortunate conflict.
I don't know myself, I play with friends. There's a couple of older threads here about groups though.
We'll have to agree to disagree that the video is good.
That's really interesting. I have to admit I'm very lacking inn education on Spanish cultures, both new and old world alike.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only reason to have a "Person the Xth" is to establish a legacy. The person is valued not for their own skills, but for those of their line. Making a person "Human Mother-Father (or Father-Mother) makes them more individual, in my opinion, while removing the male-female bias in naming. Of course, many legal systems couldn't cope with such a change.
Well, anyone with a brain (but maybe not anyone with a master in geography) might guess that those are the areas that are served by water from the Highland Park reservoir. It's almost like that is a thing that is *strongly implied by the article*.\n\nBut anyway, tell me more about your useless master's degree.
Still more qualified than Betsy DeVos.
He's my councilperson and I can say he's very responsive to the community. He's also sponsored or cosponsored several bills that I'm in favor of and consistently votes in council along my interests. \n\nMy only concern is how he seems to be groomed for the position. He's definitely following along in his father's footprints with politics. As I understand it, Bob O'Connor was pretty well liked though, so that's not really a negative. As long as he continues to take action I agree with on council, I'll await the day he runs. It'll be a bit though, probably after Peduto's done. I could see him up against Acklin in a hypothetical primary 4-10 years down.
That's the Coney in Indiana PA. It has to be.
A popularity contest? How silly. I'm very thankful Imperial commanders are promoted on merit, not "votes". Can you imagine how ineffective it would be to enforce law and order if everyone was jockeying for political gain? It'd be like the Old Republic all over again. Pointlessness like that is why our great Emperor disolved the bickering Senate.
Immigrants tend to move to immigrant communities. Pittsburgh is a great example of this. Why is Bloomfield so Italian? Italians kept moving there. Why is the North Side (and Mt. Washington) traditionally German? Why is Polish Hill... well, called Polish Hill? Why was Rusyn Valley (Or, Four-Mile Run in Greenfield) a community of Rusyn immigrants? How did Squirrel hill become a Jewish center after the second world war? Why does Carriage Park Apartments in Carnegie have such a large Indian community?\n\nImmigrants tend to move to where other immigrants already are.
I'd have preferred a video criticizing the film fortress then comparing it to the book fortress, then criticizing that one as well. He could have made three videos out of one and each of them would be a better video.
A correct observation, however I also observe that surnames in America have largely lost their meaning. Our current patronymic system is a byproduct of a patriarchal society. I wish there was a better middle ground. I also admire those (mostly, Spanish-speaking) new-world cultures who preserve both family names by hyphenating them. Oddly, I knew a man by the surname "Gonzales-Gonzales" because his parents happened to have the same name.
I mean, unless your kid is immunocompromised. But fuck them, right?
Probably because ANH and TPM aren't the second installment in a trilogy.
It makes me very sad to hear that.
Probably not a real Jedi, just a copy-cat, like those two rebels Admiral Thrawn has been pursuing. Unfortunately, some people learn of the acts of those violent religious fanatics and are inspired to imitate them.
People may attack your flag for its terribleness, but at least you aren't the only unoriginal bastards to use "O Christmas Tree" as your state song.\n\nFlorida, Michigan, and Iowa (and the city of Albany, NY) were also too boring to come up with something other than the tune of a Christmas song. Hooray!
To my knowledge, none of the things you claim are unique to PA are actually unique to PA, and certainly have absolutely nothing to do with being a Commonwealth.\n\nI'll use the state of New York as an example, specifically the County of Chautauqua. Chautauqua is a chartered county, meaning it has been granted a Home Rule charter under NY state laws. That means the county has local power over certain things.  They have a county executive and a county legislature. So far, so good, right?\n\nWithin Chautauqua, there are many municipalities. Let's focus on the largest, Jamestown. Contrary to what you've said about county level administration of school districts outside of PA, Jamestown runs their own school district which also covers a few border towns. Jamestown has their own board of public utilities, which manages utilities at the municipal level. They also have their own police department and fire department administered at the municipal level.\n\nNow, let's compare their neighbor, the Village of Lakewood. Lakewood is part of Southwestern School District. Like in PA, this district covers multiple municipalities. Lakewood has its own zoning code. Their police department is the Lakewood-Busti Police. They have a VFD, the Lakewood Volunteer  Fire Department. Lakewood even determines their own property taxes.\n\nStarting to sound a lot like PA? Probably because being a Commonwealth doesn't make us unique in these things. We aren't the only ones to grant home rule charters and have complicated municipal systems.\n\nEditted because Chautauqua is hard to spell.

Have you seen my state? The [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_and_coat_of_arms_of_Pennsylvania#/media/File:Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg) is literally the Commonwealth Seal on a blue field. God it's horrible.
Ah, how times have changed! Now I can just use incognito mode instead of robbing a homeless man.
>Pitt and Philly\n\nBut what about the rest of Pittsburgh?
Agree with you, It's a damn good fortress. The Deeping-Coomb is a natural bottleneck. This means anyone besieging the fortress would be trapped by a reinforcing army. The Deeping-Wall was thick enough for four mean to walk abreast. Nothing was going to bring it down. Even Saruman knew that he had to blow the culvert as they'd never penetrate the wall. The caves behind were packed with supplies. A siege would have gone on for a long enough time for reinforcements to arrive. In fact, that's exactly what happened when Gandalf showed up with Erkenbrand's scattered riders. The fortress did what it was supposed to do.\n\nWe know for sure it was at least 250 years old (Helm Hammerhand took refuge there in TA 2758) so that's a pretty good run. It took explosives to bring it down, and even then Saruman still lost the battle. Edit: just reread the passage in TLotR and Tolkien describes the fortress as haven't been built by the men of Gondor in their earlier glory so it is certainly much, much older. Maybe even Second Age old.
The Wizard Saruman would have created those explosives for his army. Uruk-Hai weren't really known for their chemists.
Yeah but those aren't the *real* Christians! Only (insert religious sect here) are real Christians, the others are wrong!
Slugthrowers (modern firearms) still exist in canon.
I think I'm not understanding it properly. Are all five deaths from the original outbreak or from separate incidents? They go into detail about the linen facility, so I think I was thinking it was recurring incidents and five to date?
I always recommend [Race and Renaissance](https://librarycatalog.einetwork.net/Record/.b29302511/Home?searchId=47654098&recordIndex=9&page=1#) for a great history of African Americans in Pittsburgh written by CMU professor Joe Trotter and [Before renaissance : planning in Pittsburgh, 1889-1943](https://librarycatalog.einetwork.net/Record/.b2670111x/Home?searchId=47654064&recordIndex=11&page=1) for some history of the city's early development and politics. Also, it's more of a photo catalog than a book, but [Pittsburgh's bridges](https://librarycatalog.einetwork.net/Record/.b35828821/Home?searchId=47654278&recordIndex=3&page=1) has some great photos of bridges that no longer stand and a little history about the ones still here.

Considering he took around $370,000 in donations from the oil and gas sector last year, at least then he'd be near some people he'll actually listen to.
I actually love coming in from the East.  You round the bend over the Run and downtown just starts to peek around the corner until it's framed by the Hill and Birmingham Bridge.
One could say invert this whole thing. Communities that DON'T use PSP should pay less and then pay ala carte out of their public safety budgets for PSP services like those you've mentioned.\n\nBut then they wouldn't be able to bring in more revenue for our massive budget holes. We do need that revenue, what with the massive debt we're running as a state.
I'm going with Gifford Pinchot for Pennsylvania. He was the governor who gave us our messed up liqour systwm. As he put it, the purpose of the Pennsylvania Liqour Control Board is to "discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and expensive as possible".
Is the answer yes? It is. Isn't it.
>Queen City\n\nCincinnati?
For someone who claims to love LotR, that guy knows nothing about how Tolkien described the Rohirrim. It's actually pretty disappointing how he attempts to break down Edoras while ignoring everything Tolkien tells us about that people. Edoras is a seat of government, yes, but the government of the Rohirrim is largely decentralized. The King is in charge, but his Mashalls handle much of the real work abroad. Also, not all real-world centers of government are highly populated, especially if those capitols were relocated from other places. Compare to Philadelphia (1.5m people plus suburbs) and Harrisburg (just under 50,000 people plus suburbs) in my state of Pennsylvania. The original capital of Rohan was at Aldburg, which may be a much larger settlement for all we know. We never get to see it and Tolkien doesn't tell us how big it is.\n\nFurther, the Riddermark is separated into four sections: The Eastfold, Westfold, Westemnet, and Eastemnet. Most of Rohan's larger settlements are in the Westemnet against the White Mountains. We're told there are a number of holdings there, including Dunharrow, Aldburg, and (of course) Helm's Deep. On the plains, the Rohirrim are described as semi-nomadic, driving their herds and making temporary camps. Otherwise they live in small villages and farms. Just like Mordor has a fertile plain in the south that the films never showed, Rohan has farms. We just don't see them and they aren't at Edoras. Maybe they're at Aldburg, or Dunharrow?\n\nAs for Helm's Deep, this is all fair criticism of the horrid film version of the fortress. In the fortress's defense, the film version terribly misses the mark on what it should be. The crenelations, for example. Tolkien describes the top of the Deeping Wall as "sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could look." He doesn't say that's only on the outward-facing side. He also says immediately after that "Here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot." That sounds like a description of crenelations intended for the average reader. Tall parapet, regular gaps. As for towers along the wall, he doesn't say, but his sketches seem to show rough towers rising from the Deeping Wall, although they don't protrude from it.\n\nAs for the cliffside/rock slide thing, the Hornburg stood for several centuries at least and several millenia at most, so we can assume that's not a problem. Also, while the walls of the inner courtyard DO connect to the mountain, the tower of the Hornburg isn't built into the mountain, or so Professor Tolkien's sketches would have us believe. The tower appears surrounded by an an inner wall and and then an outer wall, the outer wall connecting to the Deeping Wall. Also, he tells us the Deeping Wall is twenty feet tall. If that's so, the sketches make the cliffsides look to be at least 200ft tall. Aiming a bow accurately into what is effectively a 200ft tall wind tunnel probably isn't going to work. The effort of moving and supplying enough troops up there to rain hell on the Hornburg would be even more unrealistic.\n\nThere isn't much excuse for the ramp. It's like that in the books and sketches as well. Probably because men of Gondor built it and men of Gondor reeaally like stone. Like, a lot. Gondor means Stone Land, after all. It's kinda their thing.\n\nAs for the black powder, it's "magical" to some extent, although Tolkien's magic isn't really what we'd think of as magic. Saruman is one of the Maiar (like demi-gods of sorts), and not a weak one either. He's also a Maia of Aule, the Smith (so was Sauron, initially, and look at the shit he pulled), so he probably knows a thing or two that men of that day didn't. His name was Curumo, which means The Skillful. He ain't some average dude. Gandalf is also a Maiar and he makes some crazy explosive fireworks.
Should I call people and shout nice things at them to balance this out?
Separate comment: I'd love to hear the (civil) for/against arguments for all candidates here and over the campaign season. Tell me what each candidate has done that you like, and what they've done that you don't like.\n\nFor me, i think Peduto has helped advance a lot of causes I agree with. For the most part, he has balanced the public needs and business needs fairly well and worked to make the city more inviting to newcomers while preserving much of what makes Pittsburgh great. I don't fully agree with how he's invited certain companies that I view as predatory to have somewhat free reign here, but I understand our needs for industry. Some call him a progressive mayor, but I see him as more standard local Dem.\n\nFor Harris, I can only look at her council record. Whenever council votes on something I agree with, I can often guess who will vote against, and it is often Harris. She has advance legislation agree with (like animal rights) but to be honest, she's more purple to my deep blue.\n\nI'm just holding out for when Corey O'Connor runs.
Our Troopers are explicitly trained not to shoot at a Jedi center mass, because the murderous Jedi will deflect blaster bolts and endanger our troopers with the ricocheting bolts. Imagine the trauma of knowing your own blaster fire was used to murder one of your brothers-in-arms. This sort of psychological abuse is the "Jedi Way".\n\nInstead, providing suppressive fire is preferred. That's what Rebel propaganda misconstrues as Troopers "always missing". They aren't missing, they're suppressing.
That doesn't excuse his criticism of Edoras or the very flawed assumption that an administrative center will be the largest settlement. He disects the culture of the Rohirrim in a way that shows a complete lack of understanding of that culture within the setting. Those things are the same about the horse-lords, book and film.\n\nHis argument against Helm's Deep could be rephrased as "The director took liberties that are unrealistic" and saved as all a half hour.
And Jesus wouldn't care if you didn't help pedal.
You could safely say the last two hundred years. The Indian Wars, Civil War, Spanish War, etc were all to acquire or keep territory.

No the CPU is your processor (crunches numbers) while the GPU is the Graphics Card (A conduit to proccess visuals.)  \n\nA good program to check cou temps would be cpuz or speedfan.

Try doing it diffrently then.  Pick a goal, and then make a list of everything you need to learn to be able to do that specific task.

Youll be like cool I need to search for this, whats that bash command?  Better get familer with the linux terminal.\n\nOr I need to make a brute force script?

I would say start a hacking project to start and research what needs done to.  For instance in one of the overthewire.org bandits you need to brute force a SSH password, had to learn some Python.  Really you have to learn how a hack works before you go farther.\n\nFor example you wanna crack Wifi.  Do some research and get a plan going what you need to learn.  Break it down to small chunks.  Instead of needing to know ALL of python you can learn basic Python and how make a program to connect to the SSH server.\n\nDont overwhelm yourself to master a language right away.  :)
So thats what that is!

Hype is cancer.  Go outside.
But you said my "hypocrisy" was was not being religious and posting a religious quote. I posted the quote to *point out hypocrisy*, of OP. I already informed you of that. The reason OP is a hypocrite is because they claim to be a "christian", therefore this quote (which is believed by christians to be said by Jesus Christ), directly contradicts OP's beliefs, which therefore makes them a hypocrite. Do you really not understand?

You're right, JEB IS A MESS
I don't know, I really don't think he's a J. He's pretty well known for his aloofness and unkempt appearance which are pretty good signs of being a P (especially INTP). Plus, he's very open to new/unconventional ideas but my understanding of this whole system is pretty basic so I don't know.

Actually, I'm non-religious and feel quite welcome to speak as I see fit. But 'Jesus' did have this to say: \n\nMark 10:21-22 Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”

Not a big fisherman, but I went fishing at Camp Roberts (about an hour north of Paso Robles) and caught 21 rainbow trout in about 6 hours. It was crazy.
We've had the same party all these years and it doesn't seem to be getting better. Maybe its time we try something different instead of letting a broken system run itself?
"Grind it out" is an incredibly vague answer, so I'll take "canvassing" instead. But how will canvassing help if they just ignore our votes and steal election from us like they have been thus far?

Germans believe that laziness+intelligence=efficiency
Assuming they have good credit or at least 20% down. Working a full-time at $15 an hour balances out to $1800 a month before taxes (maybe $1450 after), seeing as they don't own a home yet you can assume they are paying rent. \n\nYou would be hard pressed to find a house for less than $900 a month rent where I live (many parts much more expensive). If you are paying $900 in rent, making $1450 after taxes, that leaves you with $550 dollars a month. You can imagine at least $200 in other bills, and assuming you are feeding yourself (no dependents) you're going to be spending probably at least $150 in food a month. That leaves about $200 dollars per month, which while possible to save, chances are you are going to have other expenses like clothes, car/gas, leisure, and emergency expenses.\n\nSo, saving 20% of 30,000 (*at least $6000*) can be very hard or almost impossible for most Americans living on minimum wage. I guess we could *assume* our hypothetical person has really good credit, but most people living paycheck-to-paycheck do not.
What exactly is your point? Are you trying to tell me I'm religious? Wow, thank you for giving me such amazing insight about myself, internet stranger.\n\nI posted the quote about the bible to point out the hypocrisy of OP, who claims to be a christian. It's clear that went right over your head, and I apologize.
> There is a little of P-ness\n\nlol
She is.
> but it's not a single-issue campaign. she differs drastically on gun rights, healthcare, immigration, military expansion, privatization of social security, environmental regulation, economic policy, education, gender/minority rights, international diplomacy\n\nFirst off, I don't agree with her stance on gun rights. I believe our gun problem is the result of our mental-health system and mass-media hysteria. Bernie is more in favor of universal health/mental health than Hillary. She didn't even mention the issue until it became clear it would cost her the nomination if she didn't. When it comes to military expansion I hope you're kidding, Hillary is a notorious warhawk. Have you forgotten about the Iraq war already? Benghazi? How about the billions in arms deals she has done while SOS? Her economic policy favors the wealthy and corporations and always has. I *strongly* disagree with her interntional diplomacy, especially with her close friendship with Israel (who I feel have no right to involve themselves in American politics to the level they do). I could go on and on, but I think Hillary has shown her true colors time and time again. If you still trust her, I don't really know what to tell you.
We think it's weird you can't! People are weird\n\n
hahaha TYT are the people not being 'classy'? Are you serious?\n\nThis species is doomed. Good fuckin' riddance!
Speak fer yerself! I been sayin' it since 'nam
I hope you're being sarcastic
How will sitting around not doing anything while the political system blatantly fucks all of us do anything? They only listen to two things: money and violence, and they have all the money.
I never said I wouldn't vote. I'll probably vote for Jill Stein if Bernie doesn't run as an independent.\n\nI don't see a huge difference between voting for Trump or Clinton; both are greedy, self-serving crooks who love nothing but themselves and power. Clinton has been "working against my interests" for decades, I don't think she's suddenly going to change. Clinton might be a bit more "socially progressive" but on the things that have an actual impact she tends to be as conservative as anybody on the right.\n\nYou can vote for Hillary all day, that's your prerogative. But I don't 'have to' and I won't.
Most churches are full of these people unfortunately :/
Maybe they're wrong?\n\nEdit: "If you want to know who owns you, find out who you can't criticise"\n\nWhy can't we have a debate about this? Any attempt at debate is "I'm being attacked!!"
Hmm I'll have to check the library. but honestly the fact that I have to read an entire (and admittedly unflattering) book to understand some of the choices she's made isn't a good sign...
True, but he's running for office now.
So you think the oligarchy has gotten to point where it is so progressive it will just give in if enough people peacefully protest?\n\nThat's incredibly naive at best.
You don't think the Republicans and Democrats have conspired together against Bernie Sanders? Hillary, Cruz and Rubio would do anything to keep Sanders or Trump out of the white house.
Mine got stolen just earlier today from my work parking lot, take care of yours :/
Wasn't she a lawyer whose husband gave her power after he was elected president?
The game of Capitalism isn't fun if you can't punish the losers, you silly goose.
But what about all the people who can't pay? They shouldn't get to go?
Yeah, it's probably hard to hear this, but your dad seems FAR more concerned with his personal wants rather than the happiness and needs of his family. In short, he's a piece of shit. Sorry, OP. There's nothing you can do to change him. You *CAN* however choose to stand up for yourself and get the fuck out of there.
Neither is this.
Though I seriously doubt her time with ISIS was fun, this whole thing reeks of propaganda and the only source is one woman who says she knows her.
I think we're all here.
What do you propose we do instead? What do you think they'll listen to? How do you intend to get them to play fair?\n\nI'm really curious.
Partly in due to Mr. Fish here.
I, like many people I know, don't care what positions Hillary adopts, as she will adopt whatever positions are most expedient for her. We don't trust her, and we have every right to not trust her. She will always favor the elite, as she always has.\n\nAnd how could it not be any more obvious that "peaceful" isn't working? Have you been watching the same election as me? Bernie could get every damn vote in the world and they would NEVER give him the nomination.
That's what they want. Trump will be far more profitable for the elite than Sanders...
OP sounds like a scared child. Literally no spine.
Is that incorrect? I know she worked for a few different companies (She was a boardmember of Wal-Mart) and worked with some non-profits. \n\nIt doesn't sound that remarkable to me, but maybe I'm a bit choosy.
I have lived in Texas and California and every theater I've ever been to has had refillable popcorn, but normally only if you buy a Large.

But how can you know that for sure?
Could I ask where you're from? Because I'm from California and not once in my 23 years have I ever seen somebody order a salad from a pizza place. I've seen pizzerias with salad bars, and Italian places that serve both pizza *and* salads, but yeah, who the fuck orders a salad?
Because of logistics. Be a horrible way of spending tax dollars.
No, I would not want either Trump or Hillary. I think they are equally terrible candidates. If Trump wins he wins. If Hillary wins she wins. Either way I lose. Trump will never get his wall built, the same way Hillary will never actually fight for healthcare. They both know this.\n\nAny other candidate but Bernie is just another part of the problem.\n\nThough, Trump probably *would* be better than Hillary. I'm confident a Trump presidency wouldn't last more than one term, and would weaken Hillary's hold on the current system and possibly make room for someone who isn't a complete psycho next time.
Wow. What a bitch. You clearly haven't been reading your bible very well in church...
Alright, this clearly isn't going anywhere. You win. Have a great night.
I'm a "Berniebro" and I *WILL NOT* vote for Clinton. All of my friends feel the same way. It's Bernie of Bust. I will not be forced to choose between a douchebag and a turd sandwich again. I have morals and they won't be changing anytime soon.

Get any metal stick (I use the mflb dabbing rod) and heat it up with a lighter. Once it's warm just stick it in the hole and scrape it against one side and you'll see  the oil collect on the tip of the rod. Repeat this a few times and you'll clear out your stem and end up with a clump of nice oil. A paper clip might work as well but be careful.

The thing is that the PDF is embedded inside the sites "PDF viewer" similar to Adobe reader where it shows the chapters and bookmarks. \n\nSo I'm thinking of just using a Python tool to scan the pages into a picture or PDF then use another program for PDF sorting to align, cut and order the long page scan. \n\nI'm not familiar at all with useful tools, the only one I know of that can capture a web screen is selenium but I'm not even 100% sure on its capabilities.

Cool thanks for providing the video and not just downvoting for asking. 
Influencing a primary within a neutral party is rigging. To what degree is debatable.
She lost to a TV celebrity. The D's were set to win it, R's were in shambles. Only Hillary could've lost to Trump, and the elite pushed her through, because in their mind Trump was a better option than Bernie. 
Is this Wiccan? How would you categorize this mindset?
If this was just another wing, your comment wouldn't be here. It would be downvoted. What logic are you using?
CAN IT BE BOTH?
This isn't a team support. An echo chamber, is an echo chamber.
Trump is a liar is the problem. Which most politicians are. I guess I will believe it when I see it. I am not looking at him without partisan goggles, he could win me over. I am hoping you're right and I am wrong.
the gg ez jerks is far worse in my mind.
When the old guard dies off, this will change.
And with this line of reasoning, the media has been able to shape whatever narrative they choose. I think Trump, as always, is full of shit, but we really need to restructure how our media operates. Starting with the government having all the access. If they do not report how they're instructed, they lose access. This is a horrible system.
Pisses me off seeing this get downvoted. Like the D party is all rainbows and sunshine. We need major reform, and that includes the D's.
You really believe that? Trump has been a part of the same elite insider class as all the politicians before him.
Not a single scene, but over the course of years? Anything related to behavior is typically the result of years. It's subtle.
Why not ban them? Why tolerate sub bashing on any level. They are not forced to be here, they can troll elsewhere. If I come here and say HAHA conspiracy sub is full of fucking morons, I wouldn't be shocked to get banned. People like this are just plain toxic, and provide no kind of discourse. 
What attacks?
That energy can be focused via group prayer to manipulate an outcome? Is this direct? As in the influencing of 1 individual? This seems to be much more general, as in I want it to happen bad enough, so it will? I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. I can understand this thought process, if say you're thinking you're invoking a deity or spirit that makes the change you want, but where is the logic on this?
Agreed. More than just 2. Shilling has been going on ever since social media has been a tool for information.
I am more concerned with a false flag attack.
It is Donald. The question is. Are you willing to against your own class?
Cognitive dissonance is a powerful drug.
uh, yes.
If this is true then why is comments like this one the most upvoted? You're providing fuck all to the conversation.\nAnd after reading the same damn comment for the umpteenth time, it gets old. Why are you even here?
We're social creatures. We require the acceptance of our thoughts and ideals. Many studies have been done on just how easily we are able to be influenced and manipulated, even on topics we're confident about being correct on.
Fuck you, Donald Trump.
Depends on his opposition. Likely it wont matter. Politicians like Manchin never lose. Family name means a whole lot in this state.
Well, he will not be getting my vote. I am hoping there is an alternative.
The only constitutional convention I want to hear about is getting money out of our political process.\nWhat is so difficult to understand about this, without throwing religious bigotry in the process? Are gay Americans, citizens? Well then they can get fucking married, get over it.\n

There is a whole lot of manufactured partisan loyalist on reddit. They will muddy the waters, as is their directive.
"Taking the high road" is nothing more than passive aggressive these days.
I despise Hillary, I came here after CTR took over politics. I do not think I am alone in that regard. You can despise Hillary and despise Trump. The problem is if you're against one the mentality is you're for the other. Is it so hard to  criticize both sides?
>  It's more that they are trapped in "Us vs. Themism"\n\nThen they're stupid where it counts the most.\n\n
So it's Trump shills, that are slamming the sub? I got the opposite feel through my observation. It's the same corporate shills on politics doing the sub bashing. Coincidentally the timing lines up, all this happened when CTR went into full effect.
>the people probably don't want me anywhere near politics anymore. \n\nSince when has Clinton gave a crap about what the people wanted.
Use the revenue for UBI.
How I view pretty much all religions. They prey on the poor and desperate. I wish there were more laws in place to prevent outright frauds and cons, hidden behind the veil of religion.
Nothing will come to it. Kind of similar to how partisan D's reacted to DWS. Partisan will be partisans.
>Several high profile legal experts, including George W Bush's ethics adviser.\n\nSomehow this doesn't convince me.
If she renounced her methods during the primary, and voiced real change and backed Ellison. She could be a figure to fight for equality. The thing is she has, and always will be another self serving politician. She works for the elite and peddles influence.
With the way our government works, there is every reason to believe that everyone has ulterior motives, but you do make some good points. My biggest concern is wall street and the stranglehold grip they've had.
That makes no sense at all.
Yes, but he isn't the entire media. I think criticism of Trump is warranted, but what we're seeing is an all out war.
She got more votes, due to the manipulation. Why is this such a massive leap?
Are there any direct connections to the people getting busted to the Clinton foundation? This is way too vague and seems click baity.
If that's the case why are you sitting at a 140 comment score? Wouldn't that fact alone prove how wrong that claim is.
I just got back from a crowd of over 2k watching Bernie Sanders speak. It is corruption that the state despises the most. The state can turn blue. The D's just need to prove they actually care, and not just give it lip service.
That's a good point as well. We are getting proper dialog fortunately in the thread. The impact/ or not that Sessions will have.
I think the scared generation is dying off though. I think our future will be much brighter in 20 years, if it isn't too late by then.
Varies, atheist have no doctrine. The only thing that word entails is they're without belief. This usually applies to organized religion. You can still be an extremely spiritual atheist.
Played it once for the free loot box. Hated the experience.
I get to see this man speak on Sunday. He is a hero in my eyes.
I would say this is an accurate prediction. The D's have lost the trust of the state, no question about that.
More authentic. It is hilarious at times.
Of course it is. She failed to reach out to them. The state doesn't even want her there, in any capacity. If your mentality is, oh well they're just R's and a red state, then you're missing the entire point.
Nah, R's are a bit different. They're a lot more up front about their motivations, not that I care much for their positions.
If you do not mind. I would appreciate it. 
At one point in time the top comment(stickied I am assuming, because it wasn't the top by vote count) had a reply that said nothing but "lol pizzagate" it had more upvotes than the main comment actually providing resouces on the subject. A post with over 500 upvotes saying the sub has been taken over by t_d, and this is just another wing of it. Hardcore brigading IMO, not via t_d, but from the same shills that took over /politics. Their methods are almost identical.
Ok thank you. I didn't think there was a way via windows to check it, ty for confirming. I will look up the specs on my mouse.
My money is on disenfranchised Bernie Sanders supporter.
Quick question, does the timer on the graviton surge start after it hits the ground or target, or does it start after it is fired? Also with Mei and her ult?
It's relevant. Corruption is out of control, and our president is claiming to drain the swamp. Who the attorney general is, and the fact of having one, intertwines with many of the modern conspiracy theories. 
Stop with the litmus test of WHO is American. We all are. R's pull this BS. Isn't there enough divide as it is?
What does the DNC stand for? They seem to go against it when it's convenient.
I was there. Was an honor to see and hear him speak.
ok pal
Because if everyone is engaging in a logical discussion, it cannot be an echo chamber.
I lean left, and have seen the opposite. Look at the votes in this thread. Anyone with a Pro Trump comment is downvoted. This is the case in most of the threads. And like the OP has stated the top comment is bashing the thread itself. In the style of politics.
Not sure, I saw him in Charleston, the day before that event. He was complaining about it, and said that they were not going to stop him. I wouldn;t be surprised if this was the case. Sounds exactly how Bernie would respond. How main stream media does not want to focus on income inequality, and that town hall would have surely addressed it.
I think in this kind of exercise, spirituality is irrelevant. It's the idea that willpower can change or influence the world around you. I would like to think of this as a possibility, but calling me a skeptic is putting it mildly.
Listing SD's at the beginning of the process, was enough. Let alone all the other BS that came with it. The DNC shair got fired, there was direct collusion. So are they just incompetent?
Well I didn't know who Tana Mongeau was before this. Why would anyone pay money to hear someone vent their drama BS? I agree with the guy who made this, we empower words way too much. I like how honest he was with himself on telling everyone what the proper retort should've been, to just make him look like a douche.
How can you determine what dpi your mouse is currently set for?
It's the state that is the problem. I live in West Va. The coal barons bought out our legislation long ago. Many are convinced that coal is the only future of the state. How dos one get a job in the field, or better yet, start a small business in installation? 
The source of said content is important as well.
Yes, but his last name is Manchin. 
If this source isn't banned by politics, I would be shocked. The majority of clickbait articles I see on FB, is from this site. This is literally fake news.
> their egos so bad that they can't act like mature adults\n\nThe problem is, the majority are not this at all.\n
At times with zenyatta I get so frustrated that ill pop my ult and use it as a carrot for my team to get off its ass and push for the objective.
Nobody is talking about how he unethically held onto information until after Hillary won the primary. Why isn't that discussed? I think both instances are inexcusable, but the criticism is always the same note.
On choke points it's nice. Toss down one when Rein's shield is about to break. 
Think of it as a promoter, and a team, more so than a single protester. Many times it only needs a push. 
The D's lost me during the primary. You will not see me defending Hillary, but I am not "happy" Trump won. I think he is divisive, and using that division in the same manner as R's before him. I believe in the acceptance and equality of all Americans, no matter the religion or culture. His base is extremely religious, and he is surrounding himself with many who have extreme views. This worries me.
I support neither Trump, nor D's, but the left is just as guilty at doing this. It is the standard goto when you run out of facts.
Wouldn't be a hard job. The man practically writes it himself.
State is racist, but not solid red. We have one of the lowest, if not lowest minority percentages in the country. The northern blueish side of the state has been growing though. The baby boomers children, do not have the same mentality as their parents. All signs point to a more left leaning growth. 
>An August 2007 Pew poll found that 68 percent of Americans believe that "angels and demons are active in the world"\n\nYou sure about that?
The Clintons. That's what happened. Most of the state cannot stand them. The D's have to earn their trust. Sanders has done that, if the primary voting data is a judge.
I just started browsing, but this thread is filled with folks just bashing the sub, and that's it. So if that isn't brigading, I do not know what is.
t_d has a presence here, no doubt. Saying it's just another wing is an exaggeration. I lean left, and have encountered more leftist/libertarians than hardcore Donald supporters. They do not represent even the majority, let alone calling it a wing.
Democrat politicians in general are wolves in sheep skin.
Difference being is t_d is a circle jerk sub, and claims to be. Politics claims to be a neutral sub, and is anything but.\nI lean left, but this crap about if you support Trump, then you do not belong here rhetoric is getting old. Ideally who you support should be completely irrelevant, and we use the facts and speculations at hand to form our own conclusions. Seeing someone's retort as, oh you posted in t_d, so therefore your opinion is null, it's lazy and counterproductive.
Correct me if I am wrong here, but aren't many libertarians quite the opposite? I thought many wanted to shutdown the World police effort via the US. Shut our bases down and focus on our own problems.
I am sick of hearing this man's BS. We know where your loyalty lies, with the party. Let us see some action.
Not feasible in WV. Not even close.
If they cant have someone under their control, then they just cut the funding.
Just died in the witcher by attacking a couple goats, and misjudging my distance of the cliff.
No before AND after shots?
I believe it should be.  I don't think we should censor hate speech, but instead speak louder and to more people than it.  Hate speech comes from hatred and if hatred festers unexpressed and/or challenged it rears its ugly head in ways that are even worse (e.g. President Trump).
Let's keep reminding ourselves that we're just looking at possibilities and there's no hard evidence for our suspicions; now that that's out of the way, it certainly sounds like he's running away from something if this is a pattern.
Thanks for the info.  I've been doing the tea thing for a few days and I seem to be having bad crashes at the end of the day.   I'll give it a little more time.
Splashtop is the cheapest and easiest to use that I've found; $100 flat rate for their SOS/Ad Hoc and I believe $199 for their yearly.  I had a logmein subscription last year for $600.\n\nNote:  I have found Splashtop to be a little less reliable (more disconnects) and they had an issue with connection errors that seems to be resolved now.
I'm not suggesting it's scripted.  I think Ronnie was completely talking "off the top off his cuff" (as bobo would say).  When I was 16, I took part in a cruise ship "hypnosis" show.  The brought anyone who wanted to participate from the audience and asked them to close their eyes and listen to the the sound of the voice speaking blah blah blah.  They then said, "your hand feels lighter, as if it's floating."  At one point they said, if you're hand isn't feeling lighter you can go back down to your seat (i.e. If you're not willing to go with the flow and participate then we don't need you).  They then proceeded to have a show while "making" us do all kinds of crazy shit.  At one point I was draped all over a much older woman, dancing sexually while taking my belt off etc.  I was aware the entire time and knew exactly what I was doing but I had a chance to be funny and do ridiculous shit while having an excuse that I was hypnotized so no residual embarrassment afterwards.\n\nI had several people approach me afterwards and ask me if i was really hypnotized, to which I (even surprising myself) said YES.  For some reason I wanted to maintain the illusion, unconsciously.  If I admitted that I wasn't hypnotized then all of the embarrassing shit I did would then be embarrassing.\n\nI know this is just an anecdotal example but hypnosis does not work this way.  It's a very subtle form of suggestion that is quite effective in therapy to re-learn some poorly adapted thought patterns.  It has NOTHING to do with being able to control peoples actions in the short term or enable the "hypnotist" to cause someone to do something without them knowing or remembering.\n\nRonnie LOVES attention (just like Sal the turtle).  He was given an excuse to act like an idiot and get some attention and deny that he remembered it (saving face).  He certainly isn't going to admit to it being bullshit.\n\nI just can't believe that Howard (who judges anyone that might believe in something dubious) believes in this bullshit.  I guess that's why I wrote an entire treatise about it.  Ugh.
Not a non-answer, you're experience :-)  Exactly what I'm looking for.  I realize that anecdotal evidence doesn't necessarily apply to me.
I guess you got downvoted because this post is probably sponsored by "Juicir" or whatever they fuck the name is.  BUT you're absolutely right, no pulp = sugar water.
I mean i know it's a bit unrelated but how friggin tall is James Comey?
Trump...err I mean...this hypothetical president would resign.
"A great many Negroes" haha.  SLAVES!
Yeah, they're pretty much dead and dashboard can be turned off in settings.  I do use one feature:  The web clip is cool as I can keep a particular section of a web page on dashboard that I want to reference regularly.
Yes, good point.
I heard it's going to have anti-gravity capabilities and will also fold laundry, or so it's rumored.
Make sure your devices (e.g. Iphone/ipad) running the remote app are connected to the 2.4GHz band NOT the 5.
Hey, all he did was take nude pictures of a 14 y/o boy!  Since when is that inappropriate???? Oh wait, you're talking about the character he played....
Haha...yes.
I don't think the op-ed excuse holds much water.  If you're writing in a paper, most reasonable people would assume that that paper supports your opinion.
Probably a 15 year sentence, lifetime sex offender registration and likely a 30 year stint in a civil commitment center (another prison) until he can prove he's cured.

I can't WAIT for the Oliver Stone movie.
She didn't rape him, she had an AFFAIR with him, right?
The hypnosis bits are complete bullshit.  Hypnosis does not MAKE people do things they don't want to do or not allow them to remember the things they did.  The type of "hypnosis" on the show is cruise ship hypnosis meant to entertain, where the person who is being "hypnotized" has a nice excuse to act like an idiot and then claim plausible deniability that he was "hypnotized."  That is not, nor has it ever been how real hypnotherapy works.  The fact that Howard and Robin buy into it is ludicrous and I honestly doubt that they do.
LOL.
This study brought to you by Starbucks.
Wow, only 4 hours before 70mg is ineffective for you?  That's a bummer.\n\nI understand what you're saying about having to sit and CTFO when taking adderall.  I would describe my experience similarly.
Got it, thanks.
The boot chime has been eliminated on the new Macbook Pros.  Oh, I see that you tried to re-enable, ignore what I previously said.
How much less could they care? 
You're right, I am kinda mad I guess.  Actually I think I'm more frustrated.  I've been listening since I was 12 (34 now) and I just feel like the show has become a very plain vanilla version of itself.  One of the most endearing elements to me was Howard's lampooning of Hollywood; he just seems desperate to be a part of it now.  I'm not sure why I still listen.  Maybe because there are still a few good laughs for me every show.  I think having strong feelings about the trajectory of the show is part of being a long-time listener.  It's like a family member you care about starting to make poor life choices.
Exactly.  Sounds a bit 1984; ministry of peace (war ministry), ministry of truth (propaganda ministry).  We shouldn't censor these idiots but talk louder and challenge them when they do.
Holy shit this is hilarious.
She even uses the word "relentless" in the explanation of why the funds are being returned.  I'm not detective but it's not THAT common of a word.
Took care of those cankles for her too.
Went to camp in the mid 90s in upstate NY.  This is Action Park I believe, unless there's another one.  I remember walking by it and thinking "nope."

OMG...just realized Donald Trump is spider man.
You're right, Ingesting sugar without the pulp to moderate absorption is as bad for you as drinking soda.
There's a really great one for an Apple Consulting Biz in Denver called "Once You Go Mac" but it's MINE and you can't have it 😝
Hillary was always most concerned with Hillary.  If speaking out isn't going to benefit her in some way, politically, you get silence.
I've been playing with Trello recently too but got sidetracked with Omnifocus.  Does anyone have experience with Omni?
SWEEEEET!  Just need to free up $879 more dollars a month and I'm set.
Yes, my mistake...haha.  Good catch.\n\nOne other thing about hypnosis.  Pay attention to when Ronnie starts cracking up.  He's cracking up because he is aware of how ridiculous what he's doing is and can't help not laughing.  In order for this not to give him up, that he's completely aware, he keeps laughing as if it's some part of the "hypnosis".  \n\nBtw, do you think I have too much time on my hands?
not to mention ADIDAS is named after the german founder Adi Das.  Figures a guy like this would tattoo something that he doesn't know the meaning of.
In reality, if someone wins a lottery that makes a difference in their life, the back money owed on public assistance would probably pale in comparison.
I agree, I kinda prefer these as I never carry cash anymore.
Good advice. Thanks.

If they are credentialed and/or board certified you can file a complaint with their licensing board.

I don't think he's continuing lies, I think he's speaking to what all of the intelligence agencies have concluded.  In what other way would one be able to conclude with any degree of certainty than by a consensus among many different agencies?
This chart looks like a way of saying "some of these services are antiquated and you should use these other ones."  Someone paying you to make this?

Okay, I'll give that a try.  Thanks.  I'm ADHD and I really need something that lays things out visually.  Collapsible folder structures are not good as for me it's "out of sight out of mind."
That is a very good analogy.  RAM is best understood as working memory in humans (resource for what's happening right now, in the moment).  We suck at that.
Gotta be careful when the Anti's start looking like the thugs.  There's a PR war too.
BTW, we have to be very careful about just accepting declarations of "Truth" just because a site calls themselves factual.  Politifact is just an offshoot of The Tampa Bay Times.  They don't have anything unique or special about their staff than other news organizations.  I would be skeptical of any site that uses "pants on fire" or "pinnochios" (e.g. Washington Post) telling me something is factual.
I was making a facetious comment about how ridiculous the media is when they regularly call Woman/Boy interactions "Affairs" and Man/Girl interactions "Rape."  They're not the same thing, is the point.  
That's not interracial, but certainly multicultural.  
I saw his videos posted about 6 months ago on here and it absolutely changed my understanding of ADHD AND my life for that matter.  
Because it's sexier when they say it that way.  Media gotta sell the sex.
IIIFFF you get bored, haha, that's a good one. 
Did the girlfriend get charged for production of CP?
Pretty sure we just caught live stream of Trump launching against North Korea.
TBH I alway cringe when I see group conversations of people who try to out-funny one another; it seems sad to me.  I prefer watching these guys individually.
I think "against their consent" is a given considering it was a fatal disease.
Ya know I'd be happy with the "Be a little gay" recommendation; 50s or current definition.
Could these click-bait-y articles posed as questions be any more annoying?
Understood, but the article specifically talks about a "ticket to riches."  Seems to imply a pretty big lottery win
The speaker was effectively silenced.  Where does his viewpoint go when that happens?  It doesn't just disappear.  Where do the likeminded go when the event is cancelled?  Their feelings and opinions don't just dissolve into the ether.  They feel even more validated in their beliefs, even more resolute to find an outlet for their expression.  They are then forced into echo chambers of their own opinions until everything they believe and say goes, not only unchallenged, but encouraged and supported.\n\nAlternatively, the protestors should have protested when the event was CANCELLED.\n\nThey should have critiqued, criticized and challenged every hateful and ridiculous thought spewed out of that event; they should have stood up for the opportunity to hear and respond to the bullshit.\n\nYou don't kill cancer by pretending it doesn't exist.  
I've signed.  Let's get this plastered over reddit!
I was playing with omnifocus and they have a mac extension as well as iOS that adds "omnifocus" send to inbox to the share menu.  I also see recurring setting for tasks in omnifocus as well.  Is there are a different reason you stick with Apple Reminders app instead?  (Oh also there is a siri integration for omni)
She DESERVES to be treated how she treats others.
THIS would get me excited about politics again!\n\nThe website to participate is DRAFTBERNIE.ORG
This doesn't solve the problem of how to remember that you already made a list however.
I've had US Bank for the last 1.5 years since I started; I HATE U.S. bank.  Had I to do it over I would have gone local credit union or Amalgamated Bank (A not for profit that invests only in renewable energy and other green and progressive industries)
😂
If GDP is a good measure of the value of an economy, Hawaii is worth 61 Billion (2007).  According to Forbes Mark Zuckerberg is ONLY worth 53.6 Billion (poor schmuck).  Poor guy can't afford Hawaii.
Love is a battlefield.  Don't hate the player, hate the game.
I made a previous comment that the search should continue, of course, and that this is purely speculation.  The conversation was meant to be a discussion on all possibilities, as the parent being involved is statistically the most likely scenario.  Suppressing critical thinking for fear of being insensitive or rude, doesn't really serve anyone.
Yikes, throw it away.
That dog is high as f*ck.
Are you fucking kidding me with this shit?  I can't even paint my walls.
I would hope he learned a little something extra from the Freudian Psychoanalyst he sees 9 days a week.
Not crazy about all of it, but some of the icons are really pretty.
That exact project is on my to-do list, wait what was I doing?
Yes, I am your husband.  Where's dinner damnit! I'm scratching in inappropriate places, too.
This is a repost, but cute nonetheless.  The dog was kinda slacking on the car wash hose.
Let's not get complacent, however.  There are still a lot of establishment Dems that are NOT happy with Bernie's presence as the voice of the party at the moment.  They are busy behind the scenes actively working to undermine him, just you wait.
I love you kid, you're like a brother to me you understand....uhhhh....you cheap muthafucker.
I just booked.  Thanks for posting.
Very true.  Child kidnappings by STRANGERS are just so incredibly rare that it's hard to believe.  One wouldn't think so by how the media loves to cover the stories, but it's VERY rare according to the DOJ statistics.
Wow, this would be amazing.  Maybe the U.S. will intern and interrogate him and keep him in prison, with access to a phone of course.
I disagree, I think taking statistical probability into account is important in discussion of these issues.  Yes, I agree that evaluating body language is pure speculation.
Would you not agree that the "how" is somewhat important?  You can certainly kill cancer by shooting yourself in the head.  
You're forgetting the Avalon. 
But it does have that bastard of an exhaust manifold. The CVT comment was said just in case he was considering other Nissans. 
Have you sat in that generation Sentra? It's like sitting in a Rubbermaid tote.\n\nI'd look at some of the suggestions above... Cheaper than an Si, but still fun to drive. 
Yup yup. Rock Springs Run at Kelly Park is astoundingly beautiful. 
Just as an alternative... You could get a 10-11 Ranger with less than 100k for about $5k (or less). The 2.3/5 speed is no speed demon, but bulletproof, and will get mid-upper 20s MPG highway. 
Plus it's "against the rules" in the US to put an older engine in a car. Doubt anything would come of it, but it's technically against EPA rules to install a 01 engine in a 05 vehicle. 
Finally some eyes. :) Adorable. 
This is really simple to do... \n\nActiontec ScreenBeam Mini2 Wireless Display Receiver(SBWD60A01) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O14JG2Y/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_1uDPybYT3SH9A\n\nStick that in an HDMI port. Swipe down the notification menu, hit "quick connect", and then click on the ScreenBeam. \n\nAbout 10 seconds later... Voila... Anything on your phone's screen is now on the TV. It uses WiFi Direct, so you don't have to be connected to a WiFi network. 
Cut it shorter. It looks like a helmet currently. 
The one in Savannah? Been meaning to try them. 
Don't know where you're taking cab rides, but the ones I've ridden in are usually 200k+ mile clapped out Vics with no brakes and bald tires. That shit doesn't fly with Uber. 
Here's a behind the scenes video of the making of the "city" intro:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wqzihgR_-SI
Those people are morons, but it's often caused by dashboards that are constantly illuminated in modern cars. 
Heh... Just like a Chevette. 
To me, that'd be awesome. 
I'd imagine it's easier nowadays for a Focus. Everything from a $10 Autozone cone filter to something fancy like a K&N. 
Just looked it up... An 8 oz container. 
I'm the same. Average about 150gb/month with my unlimited plan. \n\nWonder what the difference is between yours and mine aside from the form factor. 
That is a 120v 20a outlet, *or* 240v. This is why you always test the circuit before any modification. 
Like others have said, pay down your debt first. \n\nIf you have to have a new car... Lease a Volt (IIRC they're $250-300/month) and get a Model 3 when your lease is up. 
No no... Making 6-8 quarts of pasta **sauce** costs about $10.\n\nWater for cooking pasta? I use about a quart to do a single serving of fettuccine in a medium saucepan. 
Yeah, around town it's a bit sluggish (but considering 150hp in a 5000lb wagon...), but the tradeoff is worth it. I get vastly better mileage now too. Jumped from 17-18 to 22-23mpg on the highway, even with a 3.55 rear end. 
Personal opinion, but I think it looked better before. The after pic looks like dirty grout. 
IIRC that model has an exhaust manifold with an integrated catalytic converter. The latter is prone to failure, and the cat's honeycomb is sucked into the engine, trashing the cylinders. \n\nI'd avoid. I'd also avoid any Nissan with a CVT. 
That reasoning applies to all cars. \n\n4WD will not help you stop or turn any better than a FWD car. Keep the Hyundai and buy some proper dedicated winter tires for it. It costs you zero extra in the long run, and they make an insane difference in ice and snow. \n\nIdeally you would have the Elantra paid off after 3 years, especially if you have the cash to consider a fancier car. 
Put the bearing in the freezer. Arm in a 170 degree oven. 
Even easier... $3 worth of dry ice from the grocery store. 
Google somewhere... Did it to my mother's '14 Altima a ways back. 
So freaking long... Plenty of room for activities! 
If you think that, you don't understand how winter tires work. 
I wish they had a category for unique cars. I've got an 88 Country Squire wagon (same as the wagon in Lampoon's Vacation)... Perfect condition, seats 8, and people could ride in the wayback. 
Let reviewbrah explain... \n\nhttps://youtu.be/IravU6BH1-w
Shame you're being downvoted for your opinion. \n\nFor me, the E39, E38, and the Z3 were the most attractive modern BMWs, and they've gone downhill from there. \n\nI'm not exactly a fan of Chris Bangle's designs. 
Shame that he hasn't posted in months. 
That's gotta be understeer city. Those engines weigh about the same as the moon. 
I love these when I can find them on sale:\n\nhttp://www.readypac.com/our-brands/bistro/\n\nFilling and tasty, and they don't seem to mind being unrefrigerated for a few hours. 
Mine's an old 5.0, but yes, the low end suffered when I went to mustang headers and 2.5" true duals. It used to fall flat after 3000rpm but now pulls much better up to redline. 
And it would also require WiFi from a home broadband connection. Devices like these use WiFi direct, so there's no need to have a router in between the phone and TV, or home internet. 
You absolutely do not want a TT, unless you HAVE to have it for the bauhaus styling (which I personally love). It's basically a MK4 VW (Golf, Jetta, Beetle), and is a tragically unreliable vehicle platform. Parts are also expensive, and it's a pain in the ass to work on. \n\nOn the reliable end, an Accord Coupe would be a great buy. Want something fancier? Volvo C70. Something more obscure? Toyota MR2. 
Bar Keepers friend and a damp sponge. Rub in a circular motion and rinse off. 
Uber drivers have to have a less than 10 year old car, have to have it inspected (even in states that don't require vehicle inspection), and need to maintain a 4.5 star rating. Drivers using cars that aren't clean or maintained get fired pretty quickly. \n\nI've used the service a couple dozen times and the worst I've seen was a Camry with a dent in the rear bumper cover. \n\nNot sure what you consider a "civilized country", but I've been in some really shitty cabs in the USA and several EU countries. Uber is always nicer, cleaner, faster, and cheaper. 
The tees hanging on the racks ;) 
You have a ton of options in your $7k range... \n\nIf you like Nissan, an Altima or Maxima with the VQ V6 and manual are a hoot to drive. A Cobalt or HHR SS (yeah, polarizing styling) with the 260hp LNF will destroy any SE-R or Si in acceleration. Mazdaspeed 3 has some motor mount issues, but is otherwise a great car... As is the MS6. Focus SVT is a bit older, but they're a hoot to drive as well. \n\nOr... You could just buy a Miata. :) 
Gloves. 
Meh... The 2.3 was an engineering marvel at the time, but if it overheated, even slightly, it was fucked. 
Poor money management... Heck even being destitute, is not a justification for theft.  There really isn't a justifiable "side" other than "don't steal". 
For $1000, if it starts, goes, and stops reliably, it's a great deal. Doesn't matter the make or model. \n\nLike any car, check the body in the engine bay and trunk for evidence of bodywork, check out fluids, belts, etc., and do a thorough test drive. 
You've just seen this a long time ago
"My rear differential blew up because of the mismatched spare. Please pay for the $4500 repair on my Audi/Volvo/BMW". 
At least with a Previa you can say you've ridden in a mid engine car... 
After they stuff it with fillings, isn't it at least a pound? \n\nI have Chalupas fairly regularly. One (with about 5 packets of diablo sauce) is a fulfilling meal. I don't think this would be any less. 
RIP spicy chicken crunchwrap and BLT chalupa. :(
It's Thailand. East Asian countries love them some 7 Eleven. 
Consider making your own in large batches. You can make Ragu quality sauce for cheaper than the jarred stuff, or make sauce that is much, much better for not much more. 6-8 quarts costs me about $10, with a decent sliced sausage, ground beef, peppers, onions, etc. \n\nI freeze mine in ziploc bags that are just enough for a single meal... Make pasta, drain, throw the frozen sauce in the pan, and add pasta back when it's unfrozen. 
Driver's door pocket is your best bet. 
I'm talking about the 2nd pic. If you look, you have clogged pores on your nose, cheeks, and chin. \n\nYou don't have to be all fancy with skincare products... Just soap and a wash cloth and focus on scrubbing a bit in the shower. \n\nI dealt with acne, oily skin, and clogged pores big time as a teen. The otc clearasil crap, Proactiv, etc did nothing. Regular face washing, and shaving daily (even if I didn't need it) finally did the trick. 
Volvo C30, Mazdaspeed 3, BMW 135i.
Only thing you forgot was bacon and banana peppers.
I've made that recipe for 10+ years over and over again. It's always a hit. Was a receiving manager at a Lowe's and brought it in once, and we had customers trying to get in the back because of the smell lol. \n\nIt's freaking awesome spread cold on turkey sandwiches the day after Thanksgiving. \n\nGarlic haters will not like it (fuck 'em). 
How many 2-3" thick walled cast iron cement mixers have you seen? 
Panama City Beach, FL. Says it on the tourist tee shirts. 
Heh... I cut my hair myself with clippers and wash it with a bar of soap. Props. 
At least for me, this stopped working a while back. Got a message from TMo saying to cut it out. 
You need to wash your face better. I can see dirt in the pores on your nose. 
Betcha $10 one of your wheel speed sensors is bad, or has a loose connection. Each wheel has one behind the brake rotor. Take each front wheel off and wiggle the connector if it happens again. 
Just like a cab, an Uber driver can mistreat their vehicle well after an inspection. 
Glad you made the best of your situation for you and your son. You mention that you both were free to do as you pleased, but what about school for him? 
Lilac Mall, Belknap Mall, Mountain Valley Mall... 
I've gotten a few ditched coffee mugs because of this, including one of those fancy Yeti ones. 
If the car doesn't roll in neutral, it's engaged. 
They still have the concrete one. Ober Gatlinburg is a complete rip off and run by assholes though. 
I'm totally confused as well. I figured I was pretty clear. 
I believe it's modeled after a Bricklin SV1. 
If you have Schwans up there, they have 'em. 
Stop talking to the family. 
There are no spark plugs in a diesel engine. 
Sort of... \n\nGotta drain that chopped spinach  (just thaw and squeeze the box). Then add... \n\n1. 2 bricks cream cheese \n\n2. 8oz shredded parmesan (this can't be omitted, and it's so much better if you grate it fresh)\n\n3. 1 can quartered artichoke hearts, diced up \n\n4. 1 small tub sour cream \n\n5. Heaping tbsp of minced garlic\n \n6. 2tsp pepper \n\nMix, dump in crock pot. Cover with 8oz shredded mozzarella, or even better, thinly sliced fresh mozzarella. Cook til melted. Good shake-a shake-a of cayenne (per Chef John) helps set off the flavors too.

From a mechanical standpoint, the temperature going up to 3/4 isn't what did the engine in.

Honestly, that perspective should be the *default*.   I mean, what's the point of saying a $1200 chip is faster than a $400 chip??  That comparison just doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nWhen I say "X chip is faster than competition", we should all be *presuming* the comparison is in the same price bracket.  \n\nA buyer shouldn't GAF if it's 4c or 20c, 3.2GHz or 5GHz, etc.etc.etc.  What difference does all that make if, when comparing the offering at the same price, company A's chip runs the things the user runs faster than company B's?  I mean, sure, those numbers can help us figure out which will do things faster, but over and over we've seen that the end result is a mix of architecture, speed, core count, and software optimization bias.  It's too complex an interaction for people to get hung up on any specific number other than "which runs better in my apps."

> AMD ~~has made~~ *appears to be making* a miracle comeback\n\nI'm with you, it looks pretty solid, but still doesn't hurt to be a little bit cautious :)
Can I make a counter-suggestion?  Stop acting like *well-corroborated* leaks (such as the posting of the same skus, at similar pricing, on multiple distributor sites) and *actual benchmarks* (videocardz ryzen bench and fire strike physics) constitute unreliable info.  \n\nI mean really, almost all of the actual excitement I've seen here has been based on those.  I'm trying to understand why so many people think that's not justified.
The current common guess is that the X's will be binned higher, so if anyone's doing ~~benchmarking~~overclocking that'll be a significant boon ... and if they're not, XFR could give much of the benefit of overclocking *without* overclocking.\n\nWho knows how much of a diff that'll actually make though :)\n\n*edit* I don't know why my brain substituted "benchmarking" for "Overclocking" :)
AMD previously said there would be a full lineup available at launch, but so far all the models that have shown up in distributor pages have been the 7's...  so at this point it seems like there's going to be some sort of multi-stage launch.  Given we know their intent was to launch the full lineup at once, it's very hopeful that the lag between availability of 7's/5's/3's will be short.
DX12 is much more efficient at utilizing GPU power without CPU overhead.  Also, DX12 includes a dramatically improved mechanism for threaded CPU operations interacting with the GPU.  So not only does it reduce the need for CPU power, it also leverages the power that it uses much more effectively across multiple cores/threads.\n
It's almost as if /r/amd contains *people with different perspectives*!!  Crazy, I know.

I bet they nearly all scale to high thread counts just fine.

I agree with you that the distinction between 'confirmed' and 'unconfirmed' is important, but the way you stated it initially implied that there was no further distinction in the subset of 'unconfirmed'; that anything without confirmation cannot be relied upon (actually, more than implied, by outright claiming much of it was made up/falsified).  In fact, information can be unconfirmed, yet with enough backing info and/or corroboration to become reliable, and much of what we're talking about here meets that threshold.  \n\nApologies, though, you're right, I'm not being reasonable with my tone - It just gets tiresome that every time something valid and positive gets posted, numerous people come out of the woodwork griping about rumormongering and hype trains and shit.  Yes, please, let's be cautious about what we give validity to, I'm with you.  But when something's valid, reliable, and positive, let's not throw crap on that :)\n

Quick commentary on crossfire from someone who loves it: \n\nPersonally, I'm happy with my CF - BUT - only because I went into it treating it as a curiosity that might sometimes to cool stuff.  \n\nA good 30%-ish of games I end up just disabling the second card for one reason or another - some just not compatible, some have minor visual anomalies or flickering, etc.\n\nIt's great when it works, and I'm happy :)  But if you do it, just be sure to temper your expectations :D

>  line it up with a shady cpu list\n\nNot really a "shady" cpu list, since it came out a month ago, was immediately dismissed, then just happened to exactly correlate with skus in numerous distributors.  That takes it out of "shady" (which carries the connotation that we have reason to believe it is false) territory and into "unconfirmed" (where the connotation is that it could still be wrong, but we don't have reason to disbelieve yet, other than lack of confirmation).\n
It is maybe a little backward, but it's also industry standard.  Slightly disappointing that AMD didn't buck the trend and lift the NDA at the same time as the announcement, but I don't think it's all that bad given that reviewers have ahd the chip for quite some time already - they'll have had PLENTY of time to form solid opinions prior to the Mar 2 street date.  \n\nSo long as reviews are out when people actually are able to buy the chip, everyone has the opportunity to make an informed decision.\n\nyes, some absolute idiots (like me :) ) will stupidly decide that they're misguided enough that they're convinced by all the leaked details and initial benches, and decide that the risk is low enough that it's worth ensuring you get stock, and will preorder.  But we're doing so knowing it's a risk, and that there's really no good reason (given rumors about plenty of stock).\n\n\nIMO review embargoes become a problem only when reviewers don't have early samples, thus can't have immediate in-depth testing *at* actual launch date.  Doesn't look like that's going to be a problem here.
So... Just to clarify, you propose that when I see another person commit vandalism, I should one-up him with assault?  I know it's a crazy idea, but maybe if we want mayday protests to be more legal, we should do *less* breaking of laws...
I'm responding to the existing conversation, which was about hillary.  \n\nJust like you just did.  \n\nNo need to get hostile.\n\nDo you need a hug?
I'm not worried about me or you.  I'm worried about the fact that the Burke Gilman trail is a *recreational trail* intended to support users ranging from experienced and crash-proof expert commuters like yourself to 5-year-olds trying their first bike.  What's there now is absolutely *not that*.
Certainly!  But you're still dead wrong when you use words like "fabricated" to describe the benchmarks on early samples we've seen.  If you'd have said, "The results are still early, production models may be different" - or something like that, I'd have upvoted you and moved on.  Instead, you claimed they were fabricated.  That's a serious claim.  Show some proof that those benchmarks were fabricated, or stop making false claims yourself.\n
Card-to-card variances mean my answer won't necessarily be the same as yours. \n\nFor *my* card, it's 1415/2190.  I've seen others go into the high 14's, and others that couldn't hit 14.  Similarly, I think most OC's I've seen can hit 22 on memory, but I can't; 2190 works fine though.  I'm on water, so thermal isn't an issue, just avoiding crashes and artifacts; even if you can hit this, if you're running air you'll probably have to consider whether it can keep it up under load without thermal issues, too.  There's just not a simple answer.\n\nThe only way you'll know what's stable for your card is to set it there and test it.  
Failure is inevitable; in the end we must all learn to love big Cheeto.
If I need a legal education to know that falsified documents shouldn't be used to convict (or otherwise justify punitive actions) against me, we have officially failed.
> fabricated from rumors\n\nYou talk about fabrication and rumors, STOP.\n\nSeriously though, you're right to call out that these benchmarks we have are not final, and show only a slice of the full product lineup, so there could be additional surprises we're not aware of.  But to use the term "fabrication" is entirely disingenuous; we have factual benchmarks of early product samples in limited circumstances.  That's neither "fabricated" nor "rumor".\n\nYes, overhype is bad.  So is throwing shit at every positive development being discussed, though.
That or they put the date way out to avoid issues...  who knows
Nope.\n\nBut honestly, if you're set on getting a full cover waterblock, why worry about saving $10 or $20 on a deal?  Just get a reference.  Example: XFX reference 480 8gb on amazon are $220-ish, and they work just fine with the ekwb blocks.  They have samsung mem, and both of mine went to 1415/2190 rock stable and fit those blocks just fine.\n\n
Ok, next kid learning to ride I see on the burke gilman heading that direction, I'll make sure to tell him to take the lane.  No problem!
I'd use caution -- Bandwidth wise you might lose a little bit, but not much; probably not even measurable -- but on the other hand, even though it officially should work, I don't trust it.\n\nThe reason why: I've got 2x 480's in crossfire right now, on an M5A99FX r2.0 motherboard.  When I first built the config, I looked at my mobo layout and came to a dubious decision :)  There are two pcie slots that work in x16 mode, but they're 3 spaces apart.  However, there's also another x16 slot (that only supports x4 mode) immediately adjacent to the first x16-mode slot.  So, I decided I'd accept the reduced bandwidth for the cleaner look of having both cards adjacent with a nice waterblock bridge (I'm using the ekwb 1-slot water cooling blocks).  \n\nBut with them in that config, I absolutely could not enable crossfire.  I could see both cards in the crimson panel, but the second showed disabled.\n\nAfter trying numerous things to get it working, I moved the second card to the x16 slot and it worked, no issue at all.\n\nI don't know if there was an issue with my config, with my motherboard, or if there was a driver issue that could since have been resolved.\n\nI just wanted to toss that out there as a fair warning.  By published specs, it *SHOULD* work fine... but I couldn't get it working, and I've not actually found anyone that's running xf in x16/x4 on a pair of 480s with recent drivers - so caution is advised.\n\n\n*having said that* - I'll be the counterpoint to those saying it's not worth it -- I love doing xf configs.  Quick guestimate, I get good crossfire functionality in maybe 70% of the actual demanding things I play, and the dx12 mGPU stuff I've tried has worked really well too (hitman, for example, I get about 48fps with max detail 1440p in single-card; but high 70's with dual-card)\n\nIf you go in with the expectation that it's won't work all the time - and it sounds like you are - it can be pretty impressive.  But definitely remember that it's especially a problem for newly released games, xf/mgpu implementation is much less likely to work for just-released games, LOTS of them are 'fixed' post-launch with game/driver/profile updates.  So if you're going to be playing newly-released games more often, you'll be able to use it a lot less often.
I noticed that with a lot of them, but the reviews for the mydigitalssds didn't seem to be quite as pronounced... But it was hard to tell because none of the reviews I found had both sizes side by side; I had to search out different reviews and compare the results.  It seemed like the 240s in raid looked like they'd be just a bit faster than the 512, but I waffled back & forth several times before finally settling on the two :)\n\nIt does make sense that the same effect as raid zero could be handled on a single SSD controller, but oh well I'm committed now ...  Worst case scenario, I have a slightly slower blazing fast boot drive :D\n\n
Oh, I thought you were saying that they weren't controlled independently :)  Yes, agreed that at some point you'll start doing damage, so it can only go so far.\n\n(edited to change phrasing - we know they're independent, but we don't know if the independent voltages are under user control)
Before I started drawing I knew I wanted to do a distinctive hairstyle that I could have bounce and sway with the motion of the character, and I too noticed the resemblance when I was done drawing! It kind of makes me want to watch the movies again.
Pretty smart since the only known way to avoid the threatened cuts is not viable (I'm not even going to get into whether it's right or not, local population would never allow us to fall in line with the feds' direction, so right/wrong is irrelevant).  Best we can do is make sure the brightest light possible shines on any punitive actions taken against the city by the federal gvt.  
I think waaaay too damn many people are concerned about why other people buy a product.  If a guy wants to ignore branding, company rep, etc. and buy exclusively based on price/performance, that's cool.  If a person wants to buy only the best product out there, who cares how expensive it is?  cool.  If a dude wants to buy from a company he believes in regardless of competitive positioning?  Cool.\n\nIf you want to know why I choose a product, we can talk about that.  And you can disagree, that's fine.  But as soon as someone start asserting that people who value some criteria are wrong/stupid/whatever, they dive headfirst into "being a dick" territory.
Nice attempt, and technically correct (best correct!), but your stats misrepresents the facts... I'm sure that was accidental.  Yes, she got 55.9% in 2015 - Which was 30% more votes than her nearest competitor (17,170 compared to 13,427), which is the only election where she ran in the 3rd.  The 2015 was not district specific, so that 50.9% has no relation whatsoever to the statement you quoted.  If you were to look at the detailed results and focus on district 3, you can pretty easily see that, yes, it was overwhelming, at least in all of the densest portions of the district.\n\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Kshama_Sawant\n\nhttp://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/interactive-2013-seattle-city-council-pos-2-election-results-by-precinct/\n
> How the hell can CanardPC do 5 Ghz on a single core if design is not capable of doing this?\n\nLots of possible reasons: Because in addition to needing hellacious board power supplie vrms (which will be available to us, yay! :D) , the chip itself has  vrms internally, which may not be able to support the necessary throughput to all cores simultaneously.  Or because the thermal transfer from the cores to the heat spreader may be good enough to dissipate that level of heat coming from one core, but not good enough to do so with 8.  Or because the chip cpc had was a silicon lottery jackpot winner.  or . or . or .... we just don't know at all.\n\nThe testing we've seen at 3.4 is enough to justify excitement, and that's performance we can fairly reliably expect.  I'm just going to stay excited about what's almost certain at this point, then if we get something more (like putting it on a good chipset gets the xfr & boost working properly, so scores go up - or massive overclocking capability - or . or . or ...), then those things will be awesome surprises - but there's really no reason to *expect* those things yet.
You know what might be a sane, reliable, and objective measure of gang activity?  How about, maybe - and I know this is crazy, but - maybe we look at criminal history.

I seem to recall there was this weird thing where once DDR3 became the de facto standard and very little ddr2 stuff was made anymore, ddr2 prices actually went up.  I had an old pc that just needed a bit more ram to be OK for its purpose, and ended up having to pay WAY too much for it.  \n\nNo idea if that'll happen again, but just saying sometimes the price trends don't do what you'd reasonably expect.\n\nThen again, those were new prices; no idea if the impact carried over to the used market.

If you mean the "concentrate or crash" bit, given the extreme frequency of hospitalizations in that specific locale, I don't see that as hyperbole at all.
The ones I'm guessing you should watch for benchmarks, based on what you've mentioned so far, are:\n\n1200x - $150, most similar config to that 7500, but $50 less\n\n1400x - $200, closest in price to that 7500, but has double threads, higher clocks, xfr\n\n1600x -$260, max out your budget and throw in another $10 :) for the best you can get in the price bracket\n\nwe'll see how they actually shape up once benchmarks are here, but I recommend watching those three.
Admittedly, the reason for slow dx12 is speculation on my part, but your own statement is why: as you said, even 20% may be important to some developers, and right now win7/8 is still pretty significant.  Everybody has DX11, but only win10 users have 12, so choosing 12 excludes some potential users.\n\nI didn't realize it had stopped falling, I figured we'd reached the critical mass point where win7/8 would fade away entirely.  quick google confirms you're right - my bad.\n\nhrm...\n\nStill, I hope to see increasing dx12 adoption, but I'll stop using that argument for Ryzen.
"Overclocking" works just like it always has - users push the clocks past standard built-in limits using bios settings or utilities.\n\n"XFR" is an *alternative* to overclocking that seems, based on the little we know, to push the clock past normal boost if the cooling solution can handle it. \n\nWe really have no good info on how well XFR works, though - it's one of the factors AMD has kept an extremely tight lid on.  Some recent info has implied it might even be limited to 0.1GHz over boost, but we won't really know until someone releases more detail.
I heard that too, and it really never made sense to me, unless there's something I'm missing.  Why call something out as a "boost clock" if it is no different from the base clock?  
This is really fantastic. I love the color palette and the perspective!\n\nHow are you doing the glow around the candles? Is this done with simple transparency?
The idea that no (or even the minority) of games can utilize threads is a bit absurd.  If it were true everyone should just buy 7100's and be done with it; anything more is pointless in gaming.  Maybe the 7350k for a little extra boost.  Those are still good performers, but every time you see a game perform better on a 7600k than a 7100, you know more than single-thread matters.\n\nEvery dx12 game I've played makes use of all of my current 8 cores, and every actually demanding dx11 game I've played that was released this year.  Sure, it's far from 100% scaling, but it's a lot more than it was 2-3 years ago.  \n\nSingle threaded performance used to be a good indicator for gaming performance, but that time has passed.  Now it's a *component* of good game performance -and ryzen's disadvantage in that one metric is more than offset by its superior performance across the board.
*based on what we know now* - if early tests are accurate - Spending the same $200 on a Ryzen chip would get you a 1400x.  Compared to the i5:\n-Ryzen has higher thread count (4/4 intel vs. 4/8 ryzen)\n-Ryzen has higher clock speed (3.4-3.8 intel vs. 3.5-3.9 ryzen)\n-Ryzen has XFR, which is >boost speeds if cooling keeps up\n-Intel has slight advantage at like clocks in single-thread (guessing because we haven't really seen like-clock comparisons, but maybe 5ish%?) -But that advantage disappears if the process is math-heavy because of Ryzen's huge int/float calculation speed advantages.\n\nAlternatively, the 1200x is *likely* to be a more similar performer: same clocks & threads; 7500 would probably be faster in low-math applications while the amd chip would probably be faster *at like clocks* if math is involved - and the ryzen in this comparison would be about $50 cheaper... AND the ryzen will have XFR, which could give you better boost, depending on cooling.\n\nSo - If everything is as it appears, you ***MAY*** get to choose from closest similar performance for $50 less OR higher-clocks and double the thread count for a similar price.\n\nAt this point you'd be crazy not to at least wait a week and see the reviews and benches :)\n\n(or add in $60 and get what looks to be the future king of the gaming price/perf hill, the 1600x :D)
Well, since:\n\n(a) the president has already promised he will cut funding unless we capitulate\n\n(b) congressional support means he can execute the threat\n\n(c) there's no way in hell Seattle's population is going to be convinced to go along\n\nThat leaves only the judicial branch and popular pressure at our disposal.

Having just played this game, with a pair of RX480's in crossfire --- I disabled it.\n\nThere's a strange lighting issue that only shows up in certain locations, usually where average light is low but there's a well-lit section (like a lamp in a dark room).  when you Look toward, then transition to away from the light, the change in lighting lags a bit and flickers, sorta strobe-light-ey.  Most of the time it wasn't noticeable, and I actually played through quite a bit of the early game with it enabled.  But when you get to some sections, it happens a LOT, and became a huge irritant for me.\n\ndisable crossfire, goes away, re-enable, comes back.  \n\nBut oh well - I was only playing at 1440p, so I could max out almost everything even with just one card :)
> and the performance is only fabricated from rumors\n\nNo, this is simply factually incorrect.  Benchmarks are not rumors.  Yes, the benchmarks we have now are samples.  Yes, they could be cherry picked.  But that is factually NOT RUMOR.  And to use the word "fabricated" is even further incorrect.\n\nI completely agree that this OP's "... they turned out to be both better and lot more competitively priced ..." is WAY premature.  I'm with you on that.\n\nBut when you call actual benchmarks that are out there "fabricated" or "rumor", you're being just as wrong as he is.\n\n

No idea :)
Oh yeah, good results for your card on graphics.  For comparison, my 1415/2190 oc'd 480, when running one (I have 2 in cf), gets a graphics score just under 12k - http://www.3dmark.com/fs/11489358 -  (22k in cf though :D - http://www.3dmark.com/fs/11526416 ), and you're a touch up from that.  I'm on an fx8370, and can't make out what CPU you're using, but clearly it's a better one :) so it's hard to compare total scores, but that's a reasonable graphics score for that card.  \n\n*edit to add: Huh, I just realized my single-card score didn't have OC on.  Oh well, still, that does make sense; it explains why you have a bit better gfx score :) 
> "Cyclists on Ballard's stretch of the Burke-Gilman Trail...say it is concentrate or crash"\n> LOL, uh yeah, that's like riding a bike in general. If you ride in the city and have your head in the clouds, you're probably going to crash regardless of railroad tracks or not.\n\nThis is the Burke Gilman Trail, one of the most extensive multi-use recreational trails in the country.  This one segment, however, sends people to the hospital (which means not including serious-but-not-hospitalizing crashes) at least once a month over the near-decade the city has been fighting in courts to complete the link.\n\nMarginalizing an overwhelmingly unacceptable injury rate in what is otherwise a world-class trail used by people of all ages and abilities is not helpful.
I think you're confused, that *was* my first post.  I have no opinion on the 1080ti, I just thought your insult-fail was funny :)
Wow, lots of ppl downvoting you, but you're not being rude or anything, that sucks.  I agree with their assessment that cl is most likely going the be marginal improvement, since there aren't any real fundamental changes being made to the arch, and KL was pretty minimal lift.  I think ryzen will hold until the 10nm Intel iteration takes back the crown and holds it for a bit, then we'll see another AMD iteration take it back sometime later... That's what it's supposed to look like anyway :)
It's not released until Mar 2, so .. yeah? :)
> where the i3 might have a 20% or greater advantage be\n\nThing is, this is overwhelmingly unlikely.  In a specific dedicated single thread bench, *with boost disabled*, the Ryzen's was 20% behind.  But if there's int or floating math involved, or physics calculations, or any number of situations that Ryzen's showed huge advantages in, it'll whittle away that advantage.  \n\nAnd really, who gives a crap if you're getting 250 or 275 fps in CS:go. Especially when the review for the 250fps chip shows it gets 50fps to the competitor's 40 in demanding games.\n\nAlso keep in mind - those people playing CS:go right now, let's say they consider an upgrade.\n\nIf they look at CS:go performance and decide based on that, they're pretty much going to decide not to upgrade.  Unless they're on some really old hardware, there's just not much for them to gain, period.\n\nIf, on the other hand, they decide based on reviews, they're going to be driven by new, demanding games performance.
If by "people" you mean game devs, yes! :)\n\nI'm on my 3rd crossfire setup now as well- I had a pair of passively cooled 5750's in a totally silent htpc/gaming pc, then later a pair of 270x's , and now two rx 480's. \n\nI love it.  \n\nBut you have to admit, there are a lot of issues.  Probably 70%+ of the time it works fine, no issues, and another 10% of the time the issues can be resolved -- but that means 20% of games either have a fundamental incompatibility, or introduce issues that aren't resolvable.  \n\nI'm happy to have the awesomeness that 70-80% of the time, but to say "people just don't know how to set up their stuff" ignores the real issues that do, in fact, objectively exist.
erm... If you're arguing against someone being elitist and arrogant, "Her people wrote that for her" probably isn't going to be a very successful counterargument :)
Honest question, has Tom's come under some kind of fire?  I've used them for many years (I want to say decades but can't say for certain) and haven't seen specific reason to doubt, but if there's a bias or something, I'd love to know more.\n\nAgreed that the pricing they use is US-centric
The route has NEVER been "up for debate" - the people SUING proposed alternative routes.  They were known unacceptable, but the city was forced to spend millions on bullshit studies to prove it.  \n\nThis route has been the one and only actual designated route for the trail for over a decade.\n\n> ...inexperienced riders riders who don't belong on open roads – rather than say, the BGT – might be part of the reason accidents happen there so frequently.\n\nThe fact that said riders are left with only this option to move from one section of trails to the other is the reason accidents happen there so frequently.
> It isn't hard, if you're producing fake information, to copy existing information. Similar information appearing in two or three different screenshots doesn't make it official.\n\nThese aren't screenshots.  They're listings in a known, reputable distributor.   (edit to clarify: some have since been taken down, but they were all actual listings for a while; I saw several myself while they were still up)\n\nIt's funny, you're accusing people of making shit up - and backing up your assertions by making shit up.\n\nAs for unreliable results: If you believe that AMD is going to release a chip that's notably, significantly worse performing than the engineering samples... well, again, you accuse *us* of making shit up...
> And guess which way the Supreme Court's going to lean once the Trump appointees are in?\n\nGuess we better get started then.\n\nFunny, it sounds like you're trying to argue against Murray's actions, yet when you follow your arguments to their logical conclusion, the arguments end up support the actions.  
> BTW: that cb score is a world record!\n\nI've seen several people reference a cb world record being set, but this score wouldn't quite do it:\n\nhttp://hwbot.org/benchmark/cinebench_-_r15/\n\nThe 8x core record according to this is 2445- 82 points (~3.3%) higher.  \nIt's close enough that I have to wonder if there was another run where the record was set that's getting referenced?\n\n*EDIT TO ADD* - Seems the world record is being hidden by AMD at the moment, probably for NDA/marketing reasons?\n\nSo the first reference I saw to the video was in an Austin video from this morning that showed the cheering aftermath of hitting the world record - it was just a 3-5 second side snippet in the video, really - then that video went down for a while, then came back with the OC section removed and the vega clips edited.\n\nApparently the peak score was high 2440's to low 2450's, just edging past that batch of 6-gig 5960x's\n\nMy bet is that AMD is planning to use this is some big marketing message in the next few days.\n\n(*edit again to add*): why am I being downvoted for pointing out that this number isn't quite world record level, then linking to the actual records list??  I mean, I'm not complaining, downvote away - but I really have to wonder what the logic is.  If I've said something that detracts from the conversation, please let me know so I can avoid that in the future.\n\n***One more edit*** - Somebody mirrored the original of the vid: http://mirror.ninja/5vixv8 - at about 3:40 they do the world record bench - no screenshot but the text overlay shows it as 2449.  they also say the previous record was 2410, but I show 2445... But still, if the 2449 is right, it's a record either way.
Why not?  It's already established that the cores have independently adjusted vcores...
Not necessarily - first because some of the details listed it with a "+" after it, and second because it may be more capable of sustaining the higher clock than the default boost behavior, which could make a noticeable difference.\n\nBottom line though, until independent reviewers test it, XFR is a big question mark.
http://images.f169bbs.com/memes/matrix-morpheus/34-what-if-i-told-you-that-was-the-point.jpg\n\nI have to assume you must not be familiar with the history if you're asking that question.  The trail has always been designed with that connection in mind, and lawsuits from a couple businesses in that location have kept it broken for *over a decade*.  Trail users are pretty cool, but they don't magically teleport across the gap.\n\nIt would be like never building a chunk of the 520 bridge, then when people complained arguing that "Oh, well that's not *technically* part of SR520..."
Me too! Been following it for years, and it looks better every time they show an update.
Holy crap, I hadn't thought about that.....  I had seen the claim that cpc got 5 on a single core, but it never occured to me that this might be useful outside of random testing, but you're right.  \n\nSo let's see - On the videocardz test where the 7700k only beat the 1700 in single thread, the clocks were 3.4 to 4.2, and the scores were 2046 to 2645.  If we bump them both to 5.0 (and yes there are scaling losses, but aren't they pretty low for single-core?  Anyway, just trying to ballpark it ) - 3.4/.68 = 5, 4.2/.84 =5 == Ryzen: 2046/.68 = 3008 , 2645/.84 = 3149 --- so the Ryzen's previous 77% single core score is almost equalized to 96% if both have a single 5ghz core.\n\n\nStill have to keep in mind, the 5 was a single sample, by one reviewer, on a test bench, and probably not thoroughly tested, so we really don't know how likely that is to happen, but ***IF*** single-core oc works well at all this ***COULD*** (maybe, possibly, and speculatively) almost entirely eliminate the last remaining advantage the 7700k had.\n\n\nIf this works, AMD needs to add a switch to their OC console to flip from multi-core performance focus to single-core performance focus; even without manual overclocking, from what we've seen of XFR so far it's probably capable of doing this, too, if configured properly.
We don't know the specific details of method, or whether it'll be within the user control in any way, but bits & chips shared a sheet from AMD titled "per core linear regulation" that gives just enough to know that it's independently regulated:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bitsandchipseng/status/829998206142541824\n
So what you're saying is, the statement that "Current estimate of NDA release date is a rumor" is, itself, also a rumor? :)
Maybe I missed it, but I never really saw any substantive rumors or hype around XFR.  I kept seeing it brought up (and I myself brbrought it up) as a possible factor that could improve things further, but I think most people had been thinking of it as a black-box unknown.\n\nI had hoped for more, so I guess it's disappointing in that respect.  But it's not something I thought was really important for them, just a potential nice bonus that turned out to be a tiny bit of clockspeed polishing.\n\nAnd with some of the documentation showing a "+" after that, it could still turn out to be better - but I wouldn't count on it.
The difference then was that those benches were an extremely limited set hand-picked specifically to highlight the advantages of the higher core count -- which didn't really exist at the time with actual software and certainly not in games.\n\nThat was pretty bad, but honestly, it wasn't completely damning yet ...\n\n\nBut then it JUST. NEVER. GREW.\n\nI mean, in 2011, they launched the FX line with the top being the 8150.\n\nToday, 8370 beats that chip by a paltry 10-15%.  The 9590 adds another 10% or so if you want to pay for a motherboard capable of its insane (220w) power requirements.  \n\nFX launched far enough behind to be concerning, but it's the lack of progression in the period afterward that really made it a dead end.\n\nThe zen arch looks like it will start much more competitively - the early benches we're looking at don't seem to be hand-picked limited sets, but actual leaked results of a wide array of tests by people outside of AMD.  So, likely, it'll be a good *start*. but AMD *MUST* have a plan for progression in order to remain competitive; if their product lineup remains stale for half a decade, how well Zen competed at launch won't be relevant anymore.\n\nI'm going to guess how well they're able to do that will likely hinge on whether they get a boost from initial Ryzen sales, and they seem to be doing the launch right, so I have high hopes - but as with all things, we'll see :)
Looking at guru3d testing, even an 8370 can reach 55fps at 1080p or 1440p (and higher res than that is gpu bound), so I'm pretty sure quite a few CPUs can break 60 ...  and looking at the benches we've seen so far of Ryzen in comparison to FX chip performance, if any Ryzen chip from the 1400x up can't, something will be very odd :)\n\n\nhttp://cdn.overclock.net/9/91/91b6dbe6_untitled-4.png\n\nhttp://cdn.overclock.net/1/12/122f5cec_untitled-5.png\n\n\n\nAlso, the benchmarks don't *completely* agree with you that single-core is more beneficial than thread count (you're still right overall, but let me talk about the exception first :D )- As I mentioned, it's GPU bound at very high resolution settings, so making cpu comparisons requires focusing on lower res to give the GPU a break - but right away you can see that 2c/4t to 4c/8t, the difference is almost 80% - on the same chip, at the same clock.  So it definitely does scale up quite well with up to 8t, but you're right that it's limited, since moving on up to 16t only shows ~10% advantage.  ..\n\nSo back to you being right :) - Your point is well taken: while moving from 4t to 8t is a huge improvement, the returns diminish significantly when you keep going to 16..  On the other hand, it does still benefit, just not as much.  Since comparing like-priced intel vs ryzen seems (so far) to give a ~20% intel advantage in single-thread benchmarks, but actual performance scaling isn't absolutely matched to and scaling only improves in this particular game by 10%, this particular game could is a case where who comes out on top is really darned unpredictable - can't wait to see it :)\n\n\n\nSo ---- I typed all that, then saw the "(in multiplayer)", which could change things further ... but really, wouldn't multiplayer *improve* how many threads it could utilize?  if not, that's kinda weak on the devs part :)  but still, it does change the equation...  But I typed too much to delete it all, so I'm keeping it :p  Still, it comes back to my earlier point: all these numbers and factors really end up interacting in so complex a way that it's often too hard to judge, so we shouldn't be basing our choices on them - we should just look at the results: what chip runs my stuff faster for the same money, and damn all the specs :)
Task manager, details, click the process, 'set affinity'.
DX12 inherently takes advantage of this level of threading, so anything using DX12 is going to have a significant advantage running on Ryzen. \n\nRight now, most things are still DX11 - but think about why that is: Because developers *must* develop for DX11 or cut off any non-win-10 gamers, so adding dx12 is significant additional development effort.\n\nThat factor is rapidly losing relevance.  DX12 offers better performance, so once developers can safely choose to skip dx11 without giving up too many customers, the comparison between 7700k and 1700 most likely stops being even close.\n\nYes, that's supposition - but look at the situation and think it through, it's a pretty logical assumption.
According to some of the release info this morning, the X isn't actually XFR; more than just X chips have it; including the 1700.  X is just a model differentiator; the 1700 vs 1700x includes a step up in base clock, boost, and comes with a higher TDP - and I presume different stock boost clock adjustment targets.  Based on this morning's info, it sounds like there really may be all there is to it, though we also have no idea at all how binning will be involved in model differentiation.
You got a 8g rx480 for $173?  This should bring you much joy!  Stop fiddling with clocks and scores and go play some games!! :D\n
> which runs better **in my apps**\n\nYou seem to have skipped the bold part :)  That very much *is* the total point.\n\nFrom what we've seen so far, it seems like Ryzen has about a 20% performance advantage over like-priced intel in threaded loads, and intel has about a 20% performance advantage in single-threaded.  So intel only has an overall advantage is the *majority* of your workload is single-threaded... and, frankly, if your primary focus is single-thread, why would you be paying hundreds for a high-thread CPU? \n\nThe historical argument has focused on gaming for single-threaded performance, but that argument is really losing traction with DX12 and even some dx11 developers making effective use of threading otherwise.\n\nStill, though, that's all just context around the simple, core statement I've quoted above:\n\n\n> which runs better **in my apps**
Plus, with windows 7 & 8 gamer user bases dwindling, devs no longer need to develop for DX11.  Targeting two different APIs is a significant chunk of extra work, so since 11 was needed for 7-8 support, 12 hasn't been seeing much adoption.  W7/8 are basically over now, and 12 brings some huge threading improvements.
What?!?!?  The DNC thought the American people wanted a greedy, corrupt, warmongering, Wall Street stooge.  How could they have known?!?!
Yeah, me too - when I say "...should lead in performance in most circumstances," I mean most gaming circumstances:\n\n-It should have a huge advantage on anything DX12, since good threading is built into the api  (and remember: until this year, developers needed DX11 support because of Win7/8 users - that's going away, so I expect the shift to DX12 first development should really kick off this year)\n\n-It should have a huge advantage on any non-DX12 game where developers invested the time to threads well\n\n-It should even have a little advantage on any non-DX12 game that doesn't thread well, but has a heavy reliance on math-based calculations\n\n-Only truly single-threaded or severely thread-limited games with no DX12 support will have an advantage on the 7700k.  \n\nAdmittedly, the latter is currently a pretty large group - but also keep in mind, that 7700k advantage in that group is only visible if the game is cpu-bound.  Most of the games in that group are older, so even that advantage may not manifest in real-world performance very often.\n\nAnyway, I'm right there with everyone saying we CAN'T know for certain until everyone actually sees benchmarks in-game.  But what we've seen so far gives us solid reason to believe the R7 1700 should outperform 7700k in most gaming situations.  And beyond that, we can *speculate* that in gaming, the 1600x higher clocks and XFR could mean it's actually a better gaming choice, for what could end up being $80-$100 less than the 7700k.\n\nThe true answer here is "No one knows" - because we don't - but the early benchmarks give us some pretty good reasons to be excited :D
From what we've seen so far, unlikely, but that's OK :)
eh ... not if it still had that 220w tdp :)  9590 performance at 125w, though ... :)
> I see these soda taxes going hand-in-hand with fat shaming, imo\n\nI strongly disagree with this...  In fact, I see it as the opposite.  The human brain inherently has issues altering behavior in response to penalties that lack immediacy, such as eating behavior and obesity (I say this from personal experience; I was still a bit overweight after losing 80lbs at one point, which tells you how far overweight I was before that).   A more immediate consequence - such as cost - could potentially drive improved behavior; that approach has been studied and while not 100% conclusive, seems to be effective with regard to smoking.  It's not about shaming, it's about aligning incentives with healthy choices.\n\nI'm not saying I support the tax (currently undecided), but the main issue I have with it is that, whether we're talking about driving healthy choices or not, many people are going to just pay the extra, and it *SEEMS* (I haven't seen any studies on this) like most people that would just pay extra are lower income, which may harm income equality even while it tries to address health...\n\nSo... not sure what I think about this overall...  But I really don't see it as fat shaming, anyway.
> (edit : Not really though if the price difference is what is expected)\n\nDamn straight :)  How is comparing a chip that costs twice as much ever sensible, unless the comparison is specifically concerning cost?  If you want a valid performance comparison, pick a chip in the same price range.   :)\n\n(*edit to add smiley, because re-reading it my tone did not come through as I intended*)
According to Tom's:\n\nhttp://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html\n\nRadeon is almost always the better choice below $250, and they even discuss the 470 but give Nvidia's 1050ti one spot because the 470 is a little too expensive.  Even the 1060, they talk about being a close call with the 480 8gb, acknowledging it as a better choice for dx12/vulkan.\n\nIt's pretty hard to look at that and say AMD shouldn't be gaining market share in the low-to-mid range (which is where the huge majority of consumers actually buy)\n\nI do agree that calling Nvidia "coasting" isn't right.  They're competitive...  It's just that their sales numbers are much better than just their level of competition justifies.\n\nI note that Tom's pricings for Radeon are way higher than actuals, too - $220 for a 480 4gb??  I paid barely more than that for my 8gb *not* on sale in December, and 4gb's look to be in the $180-200 range now - but assume they probably have the same issues with nvidia cards.
> :) I honestly laughed out loud, nice retort.\n\nWhat's *really* funny is the guy that honestly uses "Does the baby need his diaper changed" talking about the quality of someone else's retorts.  I hope one day you'll grow to recognize the irony of your own insults, because this one is going to give me *minutes* of mild amusement.  *MINUTES*!\n\n\n*edit* - wait - you may not have been being sarcastic?  If so, my apologies for misreading :)
On the "shitstorm like the RX 480" - two poinst: (1) it really wasn't all that much of a shitstorm.  It was a flurry of bad press that faded out; 480 sales seem to be doing just fine in the aftermath :)  (2) processors being over TDP aren't really similarly an issue; the 480 issue was a problem because it actually threatened to overload PCI-e slots, which could possibly damage hardware.  A 65w chip running at 85w or something doesn't actually threaten to harm anything.  AMD actually designates thew power capacity for the AM4 slot (rather than an industry standardized thing like PCI-e), so the chances of a similar issue are extremely miniscule.\n\nOn the other hand, because all the relevant standards for the AM4 slot are in their control, if there *was* actually an issue where some chip drew more than the slot was rated to handle, and that threatened hardware outside of overclock situations, it would be an issue of MONUMENTAL fuckupery that would make the 480 press look like a couple of negative youtube comments in comparison :)
That's a reeeeeeeally low bar :)\n\nNot saying 8350 is a bad cpu, it's just .. you know, a 2012 one, and even then it was a bit behind :)\n
You think the population of Seattle will support city law enforcement cooperating and assisting with mass deportations if the feds cut funding.\n\nAlright then.  We're just going to disagree on that.
Two errors I spotted right off the bat:\n\n1) You use the word "confirmed" - unless you've seen something from AMD that hasn't been on these forums, there has been no confirmation.  The information below that is almost certainly pretty close based on the numerous sources, but the word "confirmed" has a specific meaning in this context, and it's not accurate.\n\n2) The cooler pics you list were rendered by a random guy.  It's likely that the coolers will get a refresh, but the pics you link are a guess.
> you get firestrike score of ~8500 with a single 480?\n> then something else is wrong on your rig...\n\nNope.  Those scores were 10k and 12k *graphics*.  Neither of them broke 9k score (edit to add: In fact, I beat both the examples you listed).  The graphics score alone in the above pass was 11886.\n\n*edit again: removed part where I criticized your tone; no need for me to be snippy :)*
Without actual gang related criminal activity, demonstrated and convicted in a court of law? Nope.
And yet it looks like what we'll probably see, if we define "better performance" considering overall rather than just single threaded.  The 1700 is about $25 lower msrp, double the threads, and beat the 7700k in every metric except single thread.  It's possible that some thread-limited games will be better on the 7700k, but from what we've seen so far Ryzen should lead in performance in most circumstances.\n\nSo maybe not so unrealistic :)
Exactly :)  It's definitely solid info, I'm just being nitpicky about the use of the word "confirmed" since, by definition, it would mean AMD has confirmed the accuracy :)
Based on everything I've read so far, sure, this should be a great idea.\n\nBut honestly - you got burned picking a cpu that didn't meet your needs once already, and the release is just a couple weeks away - probably best to watch the benchmarks and confirm, that way you can buy knowing it'll do what you want (or, in case it doesn't, dodge a bullet - but I'm betting it will :) )
And they make their decisions based on reviews.  And reviews use new, *actually demanding* games to test.  Among that subset, Ryzen's initial numbers make it likely it'll be top notch with just about everything that meets that description.  We'll see when the actual game benches are out, but I gotta say, I'm really not worried in the slightest.
Looks pretty good to me! You remembered the [OC] tag, and multiple scales are always a plus.\n\nIn terms of the art, I really love it. It looks like it could be an official Capcom piece!

Otherwise it looks great!

It is what you implied with the title of your post- "No negative consequences for spying."\n\nAs others have said, the game does warn of a casus belli, and I assume it exists, but I haven't encountered it myself during play yet.
This is easily the funniest episode of the Simpsons, in sort of an "I'm sad that this accurately portrays reality" way.
Phew, what a relief. Someone should have let her know that before she attempted suicide twice.
Not to mention smaller states may be potentially more lucrative. If there were no Electoral College, urban and suburban areas would be prime targets for Republicans, and rural areas would be prime targets for Democrats.\n\nWhy? With the Electoral College out of the way, turning out your base is no longer the most effective strategy. If you woo voters from the other side, you not only directly increase your vote count, you also directly *decrease* your opponent's vote count. It's like two votes in one. Turning out your base will remain important and will remain the easier task, but only gives half the reward.

I agree with this sentiment, but I also think that a significant amount of Trump voters were captured by the "drain the swamp" mantra and the anti-establishment promises of Trump. A lot of people just wanted something different, someone who they thought could shake things up. Which, of course, we now know to be a lie- Trump's swamp is swarming with billionaires, insiders, and his own family members.\n\nIf we sit idly by while people get suckered by stuff like this and then let them vote as they please, we should be ashamed of ourselves. Of course it's their right to vote for whoever they want, but we don't have to be silent about it. That's how you get another Trump.
The microer becomes the microed.
I know a guy who thought the same thing, he's a political exile living in Russia now.
Agreed- I don't know either. I thought we were better than this. As of this post, only 35,836 votes separate Clinton and Trump in MN.\n\nTrump sowed the seeds of fear, and reaped the harvest to great effect. I think this is the story all across the country.
With all the pants on fire and burning up, their pants budget will skyrocket.
Any idea how he did the ripple effect in that scene? I'm curious to know if it was done by hand, or if it's running in an engine with some kind of shader.
This is really pleasant to look at.
This plan would eliminate the essential health benefits requirement of Obamacare. The essential health benefits include ER trips, hospitalization, maternity care, prescription drugs, and more. I think under this plan, people would find health care less affordable.
Which type of people? Rational?
Thank you! It's really fun to share the ins and outs of my level design.
Peoples' world views are shaped by what they see, hear, and experience. This is an unchangeable fact. The media should be called upon to act and report responsibly in light of it.
Capcom has historically been pretty chill about fangames. Street Fighter x Mega Man started out as a fangame before being officially endorsed by Capcom, and Mega Man Unlimited flew safely under their radar despite being a high quality fangame.\n\nI'd be shocked if they drew the line at MMX: Corrupted, based on that history. (Plus, it would be *really* bad PR.)
Just wanted to mention here that you can [click through to the album](https://imgur.com/gallery/KOQQP) for higher-res images.
Always good to see another fan of ЯATZ ZЯAW!
Very neat piece! The limited colors are used well, and my favorite part is the texture on the cliff side.\n\nI understand what you're going for in the pink area at the bottom is tree-covered hills, but I almost think it could use additional detail to define the trees a little more, or even more layers of hills/trees coming into the foreground. That said, the simplicity does work.
I don't disagree, but there isn't really any formal, established "team" here beyond the Republican party.
I voted no, and you should too. The name of the amendment ("Remove Lawmakers' Power to Set Their Own Pay") makes it sound good, but the outcome would be a disaster. The council it would create would be heavily abusable. Who gets to decide who sits on the council? What interest groups do these unelected council members represent? A Republican-aligned council might choose to drastically lower lawmakers' salaries, so only the rich can afford to take lawmaking jobs and the poor and middle class lose their voice. Once rich Republicans are in power, they could then jack up the salaries again.\n\nSuch a council would be entirely unaccountable to the people those lawmakers are supposed to represent. Suddenly, those representatives aren't representing *us* anymore, they represent *the council.*
It's a pretty big deal to have a spy captured, or to capture a spy. This is a huge negative consequence if it happens to you! The captured spy takes up a spy slot, so if your spy limit is 1, you can't even train another one. Your enemy will be able to use the captured spy as a bargaining chip in future trade deals.\n\nIf YOU capture a spy, you can do the same. Hold him indefinitely to deny spy capabilities, or get a really good trade out of him.\n\nI've had it happen two or three times, so it's not the most common thing. There's definitely that risk involved, though.
I love it, great minimalist style and use of color.\nI think it'd be cool to see a night scene too, maybe with more traffic?

Yes, this is a huge mistake for them and absolutely deserves to be highlighted. To not participate in your own country's democracy is to deny yourself representation at the most basic level.
The fact that Clinton is still winning the state remains unsurprising- Areas outside of large cities are sparsely populated, relatively speaking. Don't let the visual size of the red fool you.
At her house
A prototype ROM for Mega Man X3 was recently dumped, and I'm still geeking out about all the little changes, bugs, and things that never made it into the final game. [Here's a compilation of what's been found so far.](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Mega_Man_X3_\\(SNES\\))\n\nI was late to the party for the Mega Man 7 prototype a few years back, but this time I'm in on the ground floor, discovering things about the X3 proto! My personal contribution includes this lovely pair of glitch screenshots: [1](https://tcrf.net/File:Rmx3_vile_weapon_get_1.png), [2](https://tcrf.net/File:Rmx3_vile_weapon_get_2.png)
They can do what they want, but I wouldn't go if I were them. The Clintons owe nothing to Trump, after the way he baselessly called for Hillary's imprisonment and begged Russia to continue their hacking.\n\nI'm tired of the "they go low, we go high" mantra. Democrats need to draw a line and stop taking shit from the other side, push back, and fight. When the opponent calls for jailing of political opponents, building a racist monument of division, and suggests nuclear weapons be proliferated, it is time to stop attempting to work with the other side.\n\nGoing to the inauguration is going high. Clinton would do well to send a message that Trump is not acceptable by not attending.
Used to wear one all the time when I was in school, but now I use the computer more than anything else and I hate the way it feels on my wrist when I type.\n\nThe replacement, ironically, is a pocketwatch in the form of my phone. Haven't looked back, and certainly don't miss the watch tan.

凸凹 is a personal favorite. Japanese, pronounced "dekoboko." Meaning is "uneven, rough."\n\nIt may not be the most amazing word, but it's fun to say and the characters actually look like what the meaning is, which is cool.\n\nAlso you can build the Great Wall. 凸凹凸凹凸凹凸凹凸凹
It seems like a poor assumption to say they didn't participate. Almost 2 million people in New York voted in the primary, and it's likely that if they care enough to protest now, they probably cared enough to vote in the primary.\n\nFor what it's worth, I participated in the MN primary and Sanders carried the state! ୧(๑ﾟ⌔ﾟ๑)୨\n\nAnyone reading should consider participating next time, if you didn't this time. It's easy and fun. Bring a friend!

You know, it's really refreshing and genuinely nice to see an advertisement almost entirely about what you're voting *for* rather than what you're voting *against*.
Every time I read a headline like this all I can think of is summoning from Final Fantasy. With all the lightning, particle effects, and a little blue box with white text reading "US ambassador".
Looking at this it's rather ironic that Republicans were bringing up Obama's statement regarding Clinton, claiming she'd "say anything" in order to get elected.
Yes, that is Aseprite!\n\nAlso, I agree. I animated the scrolling ground as well as the up/down of the jump animation directly in Aseprite, so both of those animations ended up being sort of mis-timed in the demo reel. I think next time I'm going to just import all the sprites into my game engine and script the demo reel instead.
The site was just getting the Reddit hug of death. I had to refresh it a few times to get it to load at all.
I agree that the use of the word "team" is almost misleading here, especially with the transition team being a big thing in the news right now. However, their interests align in such a way that it isn't too much of a stretch to say they're "teaming up" with Trump to end net neutrality. Personally I'd give it the benefit of the doubt, especially since the term was only used once in the headline.
Don't blame me, I live in MN and we're sure as shit going blue.
Who will they be representing should this measure pass? Us, or the council who sets their salary?
As a Minnesotan I am ashamed by this.
I don't find it particularly surprising, considering current events. A lot of people hate Trump for a lot of different reasons, most of which are valid.
This could be a way to transition to a basic income, without everyone getting all flustered over doing it all at once. As you reduce the length of the work week, you could add basic income to compensate.
Even supposing this was true, why should it matter? Counties, and states for that matter, are just arbitrary areas of land. Land shouldn't get a vote. People should.
Saw this on /r/megaman and was in the middle of writing "you should show this to /r/pixelart" when I decided to check if it was here already.\n\nThis deserves a lot more attention and love here! This is honestly some of the best in-game pixel art I've seen. The motion of the enemies, despite being robots, has a nice fluidity to it. Every enemy and object just has so much character. It's all about the little details! For example, the destructible blocks have a crumbling animation after destroying them. The helicopter enemies have a funny little death animation. The glow effects not only add visual flair to the tileset, but are also used to highlight hazards like the flame pillars and the swinging hammer.\n\nNeedless to say, I would play the shit out of a Mega Man game like this. It's stunningly beautiful in its simplicity. Is it running in a game engine, or is this entirely a mockup?
This has got to be the least reputable source I've ever seen. Not only is the domain name "trump-conservative.com," but the author of the post is listed as "Rufus Shinra." Are we making Midgar great again?

You'd be wrong on that one.
> If you live near a Whole Foods, if no one in your family serves in the military, if you’re paid by the year, not the hour, if most people you know finished college, if no one you know uses meth, if you married once and remain married, if you’re not one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record — if any or all of these things describe you, then accept the possibility that actually, you may not know what’s going on and you may be part of the problem.\n\nThis is an extreme generalization and logical fallacy, and undermines the entire story. In the same way that you don't necessarily have to be a basketball player to understand basketball, you don't necessarily have to be a member of any of those groups to understand or empathize with them.
Below is the text of the amendment as it appears on the ballot.\n> Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to remove state lawmakers' power to set their own salaries, and instead establish an independent, citizens-only council to prescribe salaries of lawmakers?\n\nExactly which part of my statement is tenuous? The proposed council would indeed directly set their salary.\n\nThis amendment will create a group of people who hold more power over lawmakers than other citizens. Lawmakers will then have more incentive to represent them, instead of everyone else. The cause/effect here is not particularly hard to understand.
Thank you for the link and explanations. Since lawmakers are afraid of the political consequences of raising their own pay, the current system clearly does not work. However, I still ultimately disagree with the amendment.\n\nThis amendment will create a group of people who hold more power over lawmakers than other citizens. Lawmakers will then have more incentive to represent them, instead of everyone else.\n\nI feel like there must be another solution, one that doesn't involve giving power to an unaccountable, unelected group of people.\n\nLike... What if lawmakers' salaries were tied to the state's minimum wage, using a formula? I feel like creating a connection between minimum wage and lawmakers' salaries would increase trust as well as their accountability towards those at the bottom. Current minimum wage is $7.75, about a factor of 4000 off of the yearly salary of a lawmaker ($31k). Using a simple formula like MinWage * 4000 = Salary, we could still have a reasonable result even if the minimum wage was raised to $15 (resulting in a lawmaker salary of $61k).\n\nObviously that's just a simple formula and I'm sure it'd need tweaking eventually, and it might even belong in /r/crazyideas, but it solves the problem without producing the unaccountability of the council proposed by the amendment. Other such solutions must also exist.
Very nice research! You are indeed correct that X's position is stored relative to the screen number. Noticed this myself when searching for position-changing PAR codes.\n\nI think maybe it's a result of the SNES not being able to utilize large enough numbers to allow coordinates relative to the entire level.
Why do you bother posting this drivel? Your posts here consistently get nuked from orbit.
Very nice! This really makes me want a new SNES-style Mega Man game.
Everyone knows "technically correct" is the best kind of correct.
It'd be harder to forget if I could only remember what a domocrate is.
Something important was lost in the transition from the old style to the new style, and it's not easy to nail down exactly what. The new style seems to have no attitude to the characters. Instead of cautiously leaning forward with her flame spell to light the way, the mage is now standing there awkwardly wondering why her hand is on fire. They have a very "cheap mobile game" look to them (no offense- just a result of their generic expressions).\n\nMy first reaction was that the old sprites (which are fantastic, by the way) look like in-game sprites, while the new, high-res sprites look like sprites that might be used in cutscenes. Maybe try that approach, or try the new sprites with more active stances?
Yeah, the MMX games have some of the best camera movement of any platformers I've ever played. I'd be very interested to know how it works!
> According to Michigan state law, voting precincts where polling registers do not match with voting machines cannot be included in a recount.\n\nWait, what? Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the whole point of a recount? If they openly admit that their machines have failed, and their numbers aren't matching, then I feel like they have a duty to recount by hand.
Really excellent character motion. Each move seems to continue into the next action. Can't wait to see the final version!
So let me get this straight. It's not fair for Democrats living in big cities to impose their oppressive will of tolerance, compassion for the poor, and fighting for the environment onto country Republicans.\n\nInstead, it's fair for those yokels to tell us how to live, through intolerance and restricting regulations aimed at helping the poor and saving the earth? The hypocrisy is so thick you could cut it with a knife.\n\nYou want to defend the election results using states' rights, my right-leaning "friends?" You try and defend this- you own it.
I can't believe this is real, yet here we are.\n[Snopes is also reporting it.](http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/16/greenwich-town-council-member-arrested-after-political-argument/)\n\nThis is what Trump voters validated. All made possible by millions of people saying "Trump isn't perfect, but... [insert excuse here]."
I considered it, but kind of ran out of time this morning. It started as a still piece, and the twinkling stars were sort of an afterthought.\n\nMaybe in version 1.1?
Very nice. The motion of the slime is really well done! Any tips for animating amorphous blobs?
Nice, this sounds like a lot of fun! I might join in this time.
Trump openly called on live TV for a foreign nation to hack his political opponent, and they did.\n\nTrump repeatedly called for the jailing of his political opponent.\n\nTrump promised during his campaign to ban all members of a large religious group from entering the US.\n\nTrump issued an executive order that is effectively a partial Muslim ban.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump has called climate change a hoax manufactured by the Chinese, despite overwhelming consensus by scientists that this is not the case.\n\nThis man didn't deserve a chance during the campaign, and he does not deserve a chance now. Every day he's in office he manages to create a new scandal, offend our close allies, and put America in a more dangerous place.
I think the dithering is pretty okay. If it was perfectly round I'd say it looks like a metal sphere, but because it's oblong it almost looks like a smooth rock.

A needlessly harsh punishment almost certainly contributed to her mental health status and repeated suicide attempts. It's ridiculous to say that it didn't.\n\nThe Supreme Court can be wrong- a sentence that long for whistleblowing plus that much solitary confinement is what I'd call cruel and unusual punishment. If it wasn't, why would Obama see fit to pardon her?
Both [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/16/greenwich-town-council-member-arrested-after-political-argument/) and [the local paper](http://www.greenwichtime.com/policereports/article/Von-Keyserling-RTM-member-arrested-on-criminal-10852811.php) corroborate this story.

I've been to Hiroshima, seen Genbaku Dome, and visited the peace memorial. I can say with confidence that nuclear expansion is a path to a darker world. Escalation will solve nothing- it will only increase the risk and the willingness to use them.\n\nWe must rid the world of weapons that kill indiscriminately. This should not be a controversial statement. Undoing decades of disarmament runs counter to that.
I'm not sure which part of it you don't get, so I'll do my best to explain it.\n\nThe implication of the T-shirt's message is that the only way you'd take away the T-shirt-wearer's guns is "over his dead body." The shirt is saying that he'd fight to the death for his right to bear arms.\n\nCulture shock is a state of confusion or worry when exposed to opinions or customs that are extremely different from your own, but are considered normal in the local area.\n\nThe librarian moved from Denver (a large city in Colorado where Democrats are strong) to Longville (a small town in Minnesota where Republicans are strong). Republicans largely favor expanding and protecting gun rights, while Democrats generally do not. The T-shirt can be considered a "culture shock" because it represents an open, aggressive statement in favor of gun rights. That's not something you would likely see in Denver, but it is totally acceptable as per the local norms in a small conservative-leaning town.

Went in thinking "Okay, how bad could it possibly be?"\n\nCame out and was like "Yep, Nazis." I don't like to have to call for censorship, but openly attacking people for being Jewish? Unabashed admiration for Nazi imagery and figures? Declaring white racial superiority? This shit is not okay- Reddit should be putting their foot down on this. Dangerous ideals do not deserve a platform to speak from.
I understand that it's not an endorsement from the newspaper. It is in the opinion section, after all.\n\nLet me ask you though: If that was any other subgroup of people in there instead of atheists, could you say the same thing? For example, if it read "Muslims" or "Jews," I think they'd think twice about printing it. How is this any less than that?
All this destruction, just so Muslim dictators can run their gas pipeline to the Mediterranean.

Well, some Muslim countries still have Capital punishment for the "offense" of atheism (a personal philosophy based on logic and reason), apostasy (a by product of freewill which the Muslim apologists state is a tenet of islam and part of the Quran), witchcraft (a nonsensical belief in myth and magic, which is not real and at most a gross waste of time for the practitioners), and  homosexuality ( a natural but relatively rare state of sexual attraction to the same gender found in all animals) all evidence the bigotry, idiocy, and intolerance of Islam. \n\nShe should be happy she was only arrested.
Still waiting for a  Muslim to denounce Mohammed's pedophilia, warmongering, bigotry, misogyny, and intolerance.  Of course if they did that there wouldn't be much left of Islam.

Religious texts are written by men.   Not surprisingly, women are commanded to be obedient and men are allowed to beat/strike/discipline their wife/ wives/ slave girls/ those that your right hand possess.  \n\nMohammed is said to be the perfect example of a Muslim.  In the hadiths, Mohammed punches his favorite wife Aisha, the one who he raped when she was 9, in the chest.  Imams will point to the hadiths and excuse the otherwise criminal behavior of  Muslim men.\n\nAs long as the legal system is based on a religion like Islam, you will have bigotry, misogyny, and intolerance

Complete bullshit.  Our multinational corporations worked the asian labor arbitrage providing a pittance of income to the asian peasants and keeping the vast majority of the cost savings for their CEO, his stock options, and the shareholders.  Since 90% of the financial assets are owned by the top 10% of the wealthiest individuals the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.  \n\nIt wasn't because of religion or their lack of formal education.  The rich will change the rules to rig the game in their favor, because that's what they care about, money.  Regular people don't have an insatiable lust for money and power and thus don't expend as much energy trying to invent new ways to slit their neighbors throat.

Had the RNC had a disgruntled employee who downloaded and handed the guts of the  RNC's email server over to WikiLeaks, WikiLeaks would have published them.

They were trying to figure out how to avoid Trump and Cruz, the last two standing.  It was an anti-establishment year, and Hillary should have lost in the primary, and Bernie Sanders would be President.\n\nHad those RNC emails been published it would have been to Trump's benefit and he would have won the RNC primary with less opposition.

This is completely consistent with the Koran, especially when the victims are non-muslims.  That's part of the inherent rank bigotry, misogyny, and intolerance of Islam.\n\nIslam is a scourge and the bane of humanity.

Bush.  Still a fucking dumbass.  
Robert Spencer is not a schmuck.  He is a highly respected scholar, author, and critic of Islam.\n\nRead "The Complete Infidel's Guide to the Quran".  It is very enlightening and disturbing.
Straight from the religion that literally means submission.   Not surprising.  What is surprising is how the MSM covers for Islam.  
He should have used "Papa John's".\n\nThat might seem obvious now.

Because for some reason the MSM and Western governments have decided to shove this death cult down our throats.  It may have something to do with Islam's meaning, which is "submission".

This all could have been avoided had these people marched against the warmongering neocons Obama and his secretary of state Clinton in 2013 when they were arming and ignoring ISIS and drawing redlines all over Syria.
The American people have chosen Trump to be their president not you, McCain, they rejected you.
Everyone should carry a gun as long as these people are around.

All true.  Trump partisans believing he was anti-establishment are waking to the grim reality there will roughly the same number of Wall Street stooges in his administration as there would have been had Hillary Clinton's coup in the Democratic primary actually led to her coronation as president.\n\nMost people voted against Clinton not because they believed in Trump, but because Clinton has a greedy corrupt warmongering Wall Street stooge, and they had no realistic alternative.
He heard trump was going to put Romney, Bolton, and Jamie dimon in his administration.  That's all.
Actually, if the victims didn't subscribe to ISIS's interpretation of Islam then they are not believers, and therefore are not protected by Allah.  Since those victims were violating Allah's messenger's scripture by being out drinking, dancing, and mixing with infidels and unbelievers, which is haram, their death was deserved and somewhat should have been expected.
Whaaaaa!?!?  Why didn't Anonymous hack the Obama administration white house and publish those phone numbers?  That's not fair!!!!  Obama must have a secret deal with Anonymous.  Or Anonymous must have wanted Hillary to win.  Whaaaaa!!!!
They had way more to Lose when the Taliban take back power and  implement shariah law.  \n\nI hope they are not the last brave women to take a  Stand against Islam.
Interesting article.  The shape of Earth orbit, volcanoes, and sunspots all factor in to global temperature.  Plus any number of other variables that remain unknown and yet discovered by scientists.  
Prison for gays.  No wonder the Pope was so sad to see that murderous tyrant die 
They should have brought their documents.  
So the calving rate of Antarctica icebergs has been highly variable for thousands of years prior to the industrial revolution.\n\nSounds like there must be more variables that affect global temperature than CO2 levels.\n\n\n
Rallying for Health insurance.  Not health care.  Health care is available anytime you call the ambulance.\n\nMaking young healthy people pay a ridiculous amount for a product they don't want to subsidize boomers is unconscionable.  Especially given the boomers fondness for propping up asset markets to make owning a home unaffordable, underfunding education and training, ignoring immigration laws, advocating globalization, and openly advocating the suppression of wages so as to create a deflationary environment to allow for record low interest rates that will prop up asset prices.\n\nEspecially given the boomers complicity in bankrupting this country by voting in politicians who refused to think about future generations.\n\nHow convenient.
Because he understands Leverage and with Mexicans rioting over high gas prices he knows they can't put import tariffs on food without making a bad situation worse.
Actually any religion in which the penalty for leaving is death, is by definition a cult.  Of course this implicates all of islam, except the most Episcopalian of Islamic denominations.
I believe South Park covered this in the episode where the internet was down.
Healthy living is not a fad.  Eating cheap shit food is the fad that is rapidly going out of favor.

I know, it drives me crazy.

Same with Linus Torvalds to an extent (although I do generally enjoy reading his rants); but I'm cool with Linus, since he showed me MATE existed shortly after GNOME 3 dropped and I was bitching about it on his Google+
Got it; I was under the impression that it defeated app signing at runtime, and as a result, wouldn't need to have the signing defeated at every run.

> Some trans people are okay with using different pronouns for their pre-transition self, but it's usually considered a bad thing.\n\nAs someone that knows a few trans people, but am not in the LGBT community myself; I just don't get that.  I mean... I do get it; but some people get horrendously upset about it and THAT, I don't get.  If you're presenting as female, and get called him; that I understand being pissed about; but using the pronouns associated with their pre-transition self just makes sense, and helps make things make more sense for everyone.\n\nThat being said, I'm one of those assholes that refuses to call people Xir; that shit is dumb.\n\nEDIT: Before I get jumped on, I just wanna elaborate further.  I totally understand that almost everyone views gender as something innate and unchanging, and I totally get that; but doesn't it logically make more sense to refer to yourself using pronouns that fit the way you present?  Let's say I was a trans-woman, post-transition; it would TOTALLY make sense to me to have everyone use "he" to refer to me pre-transition.  Even though -I- didn't really change, there's a lot of perceived change, and it just makes things a lot simpler for everybody to acknowledge that.

>would you refuse to call them that because you thought it was dumb?\n\nNo; but I'm also not going to call you by some word that you invented to make yourself feel more special.  Using appropriate pronouns I can get behind, the Xe, Xim, Xir shit I can't.\n\n>To your edit: if you aren't a trans person, then don't try to speak for us when you don't understand it.\n\nI didn't try to speak for you, don't put words in my mouth, I was simply saying I don't understand it because it makes little logical sense to me.  After your response it makes a bit more sense; but again, don't fucking tell me what I'm saying.

I am more or less in your boat.  I took the chance and bought a launch RX 480.  I fucking LOVE that card; it's great....  but I regret the purchase, the Linux driver support is severely lacking for me (although it is getting better and better).  AMD is on their way back.
Now, I might just be some asshole white guy living in an urban area; but I've noticed the harder people try to not be racist, the more racist they actually are.

>Yes you would what? Call her a he? Cause if so that's pretty rude.\n\nNo, I mean't I would call her "her"; sorry for the confusion\n\n>And what's the difference between appearance and how you present yourself?\n\nAppearance is not all there is to transitioning.  There are a lot of learned mannerisms that have to be re-learned.  I know that sounds a bit strange, and a bit sexist, and it is to an extent; but that's an issue with the greater society.  The concepts of "walking like a woman" and "talking like a woman" and "acting like a woman" are still very alive and well, as disgusting as that is.  If one is to transition; beyond their appearance, it would also require a re-learning of a lot of these small mannerisms.  The requirement to re-learn these mannerisms aren't the individual's fault, mind you; these gender roles that extend further than simple appearance are forced on everybody by society.  The way you present yourself in society is a lot more than just how you outwardly look.  I hate to put things in these terms, because it makes me sound like a transphobic jerk (which I like to think I'm not; because I personally couldn't care less if someone is trans or not, it's not my place to care about that); but it's these little mannerisms that make people decide if someone is "passing" or not (which is, in and of itself, a disgusting idea), moreso than their outward appearance.
>So if you had a friend that was mtf and she cam up to you and said "I'd like you to call me she from now on" but she couldn't transition because her parents would kick her out you'd still call her a he?\n\nYes, I would; because transitioning is more than just appearance.  It's how you present yourself.\n\nEDIT: also, how can I trust a word you say, when you're a frakkin' Cylon?
Not only that, but did you hear about their new sheriff?

release reference RX480 here...  I hate the Linux performance.  AMDGPU gets ~1/2 the performance the card should be getting, AMDGPU-Pro does better, but doesn't work most of the time; the lack of the DAL code in the kernel means I have to play musical wires if I wanna get sound.  Overall I really regret buying this card, but I do love it.  It's my own fault, more than anything else; it was my fault for going bleeding edge, especially when AMD decided to trash their drivers and start again with this card.  Life has been getting better, but man do I hate the Linux performance with it as it currently stands.

> Generally, I agree that the art shouldn't suffer because of the artist, as the art can have jack all to do with an artist's flaws.\n\nI agree with this too; although sometimes it's hard to separate the art from politics and the like.  Example: Pink Floyd's Animals.  Fantastic album; but the album is literally about politics.  It's kind of hard to separate the album from the politics of the time and the band's political views, considering that's what it's about.  On the other side of the spectrum, though, you've got Varg Vikernes.  Varg is a horrible human being, with some truly disturbing views.  However, his music is downright beautiful, and easily separated from his views as a person and stands on it's own.

Similar thing happened to me.  Went to my friend's house on Halloween.  Sat down, he tells me that his cat got run over by a car.  Being the sick fucks we are, I thought this was a joke a burst out laughing....  Then noticed the cat wasn't in the shed with us as per norm, and ask "No, seriously, where is Kitty?" (Yes, the cat's name was actually Kitty)... Got a response of "right there, behind the pool" which is when I saw the makeshift grave.... man did I feel like a dick.
a Vega card would be nice; but I'm gonna stick with this for a while; if I can afford it, I'm gonna jump ship back to NVidia sometime this summer.  It's not that this is a bad card, it really isn't; it's a great card; but it just doesn't play nicely with Linux right now.  While I have no doubts that it will play nicely with Linux in the future (seriously, every update to AMDGPU is helping little by little; as it stands, the DAL code is the only thing I need for it to be 'usable' [but not performing as it should]; but that's not happening until AT LEAST 4.12, and that's still a way off.); I need a card that plays nice -NOW-.\n\nEDIT: Also, just in case anyone wants to tell me to just compile the amd-staging kernel; I'm not gonna compile and install my kernel from scratch, I just don't hate myself that much, and there's no AUR package for it (that I can find) to streamline the process so uhh.... yeah, that's just not happening right now

> Of utmost importance, everyone needs to get fucking serious about showing up to the polls. Midterms have ridiculously poor turnout amongst anyone but old, white folk. Kiss your ass goodbye if a repeat of 2010 happens.\n\nMore than anything else; this.  I don't exactly have a lot of hope that our government will hold together until then; but if by some miracle it does, FUCKING VOTE!!!
THEY'RE FORGERIES; LOOK THE PDF HAS LAYERS!
No, the show ends when you learn Admiral Adama was dead the whole time.
> I have a theory that isn't true at all. I feel that they are in a strange codependent relationship.\n> Charlie chases The Waitress because she is a mess. It gives him a sense of control that he can't have in the real world, and The Waitress accepts the stalking because she is in desperate need for attention that ~~no one else will~~ Dennis won't give her.\n\n
/u/net00_'s finger.
Exactly this much has been said to me in the past; and the two of us have spent time together on our own and everything it's just....  When I'm dealing with someone one-on-one, I lose all sense of how to not be awkward as fuck; so I don't exactly know how to make everything clear.  She also knows that I'm dead broke and out of a job right now, and can't seem to get one...  Doesn't make me feel better that she tried to get me one at her job and I wound up not getting it =\\
Holy shit, I totally forgot that movie existed, thank you for reminding me that piece of gold exists.
possibly, idk; I only know what I've been told, but not the factual veracity.
...and cyanide.
Dude, rule #2; or are you an asshole that gets off on ruining peoples day?
Bought a U-turn a few months back; can't recommend it highly enough.  Honestly, I don't even feel like fixing my old technics anymore, it's that good.
Kind of irrelevant when the main cause of Hillary's loss was outright voter apathy.  Less people overall voted in 2016 than in 2012; and of the people who voted, there were more republicans and less democrats (even if you count people who voted third party).  We can sit and bicker all we want; or we can look at what actually happened and admit that it happened because we just don't fucking care anymore.
God, I hate Richard Stallman.  He's got a real pompous air about him...  But goddamn is he spot on like 90% of the time.
You know, I didn't vote for Stein, and have a hard time respecting anyone who did; but Stein isn't the crazy anti-vaxxer that people make her out to be.  Her party is full of them, and that's why she panders to them; but she in and of herself is pretty not stupid when it comes to stuff like that.  Economics, however....
+/u/User_Simulator /r/anime 
Am I like the ONLY dude in the US that has regular access to kinder eggs?  Every time they're mentioned, I make note that I know somewhere to get them; and everybody shits themselves.  Like.... you'd figure more than just this one place in the US has them.
You're a bad person.  I don't mean that to say you're evil or mean or anything.  You're just bad at being a person.
Like seriously; I get that you're being extra douchey because you're pissing me off, and you get off on getting a rise out of people; but do you just not understand that rules exist for a reason, or that you're above them or something?
If you're me; you're likely depressed.
I'd say 1-4 are fantastic (although 2 just kinda.... keeps going at points), Season 5 is good but is made totally pointless by it's ending.  Season 6 fuck yeah.  Season 7 can best be described as "alright, this is cool; I like this Issak guy, he'll be an awesome final villain for these two sea--....well there goes that".  Season 8 is just depressingly bad.
not UNIX-like is a mild way of putting it, really.  The popular joke of "someday systemd is even gonna have it's own kernel" is more possible than most people realize.  As I said, I hate it for that; but in practice, it works really well (although it does a shitload of things wrong.  Most things it does should -NOT- be in PID 0, goddamnit)....  Although I do fucking hate binary logs; that shit is trash.
> People who advocate for legalization or decriminalization aren't saying that hard drugs and drug addiction is wonderful, they're saying it should be treated as a medical and social issue rather than as a criminal one.\n\nNot to mention that overdose deaths would drop significantly if addicts had access to clean drugs that are measured out in appropriate doses.
Yeah, you know; to along with their alt-facts.
No; and it pisses me off to no end.  Although, to be completely honest, with the way these things are built, feathers would be rather tough to keep on said dinosaurs.
To be fair, I'd probably laugh harder after I found out he wasn't joking.  Half because I wouldn't know how to react appropriately; and half because... I mean come the fuck on, what are the chances?
Oh thank fuck; I was worried I'd have to shit all over you....  As you were, then.
To be fair, given his description of what happens after death, he literally does know nothing.
Oh wow, so you're already down the shore; nice
Yeah I'm not surprised, systemd is everywhere.  I love systemd, but I fucking hate how... not UNIX-like it is.  It works so well, but it's an unholy abomination that shouldn't exist.
Welp, guess who's about to reboot into Linux =p\n\nEDIT: I'm also prolly gonna install mesa-git from here because fuck it, if I'm gonna use potentially unstable code, I might as well go all the way, right?
Right, as I was saying, that's an issue with society at large, but that doesn't mean it's non-existent.  Think about it; how many times have you heard of women being shrugged off for being "not-ladylike" or a man being shrugged off for being "too effeminate".  I'm not saying it's not an issue; but I am saying it's ridiculous to pretend like these issues don't exist, and at the current time, it only helps people to play along with these issue (TO AN EXTENT, before you misconstrue that statement, I just want to make it clear, I am in no way advocating for stereotypical gender roles or anything of the sort; I'm just saying that as of today, February 11, 2017, abiding by these entirely arbitrary "rules" tends to make life a bit easier for all.  It's not right, it's not okay, but it is reality).  Also, you seem to be thinking I'm dismissing trans-people; or saying that trans-women are not really women, which, simply put is bullshit; of fucking course they are, it's pretty plainly obvious.  All I'm saying, is it makes more logical sense to me, to refer to one's pre-transition self, using the pronouns that fit the presentation of the pre-transition self.  I understand that that is offensive to some, but it just seems like a silly thing to be upset about.  The thing I -DO- outright reject though, is the Xe, Xim, Xir bullshit.  That shit is dumb; if you feel more masculine one day, but more feminine the next, just use whatever pronouns fit you that day.  If the people around you can't handle bouncing back and forth like that; that's their problem, not yours.  There is absolutely no need to invent a third set of pronouns to make you feel just that little bit more special.
No one writes their own songs, including Adele. Hence why she kept thanking her songwriters and album directors. Also, let's not try to "Britney" Beyoncé here, she is a hell of a singer. Her and Adele have different styles.
Can I add that you are referencing 3 investigations from 30 years ago that resulted in no evidence. While literally this second Donald Trump is all over the headlines because intelligence officials briefed multiple members of the government on his correspondence with Russian officials for the past 5 years. If we're comparing super villains: Clinton is movie 6 Darth Vader, and Trump is Satan's asshole.
He's still an active politician, she isn't. Pretty straightforward difference.
Or you are for assuming something that you have 0 facts about. We are at a "he said she said" dilemma. You CSGO people love brigading over the dumbest shit.
Trump has been president for less then 30 days buddy. Kind of unfair to compare. Also, Trump is encouraging white supremacist actions, he didn't create it. He's just another cog in the gear of hate that's existed for longer then we've been alive. And to answer your question, there have been ZERO terrorist attacks in America by citizens of those countries in the ban.
This argument is beyond ridiculous at this point. You do realize that Bernie Sanders receives more money from Big Pharma then Corey Booker does? Like not a few dollars more, $100,000 more. The reason why Booker voted no on this bill is simple, he represents New Jersey. There are over 200,00 New Jersey citizens that belong to the pharma/bio tech field. That's about 5% of the private sector jobs in NJ. He has to answer to his constituents first. I agree 100% that our medical industry is broken. Companies are allowed to skyrocket prices with no punishment, but this bill was not the answer. 
That's not how Chain in Command works. Again, if you say no, you give up the right to hold the "football" and the next guy comes and does the job.
This isn't UFC dude lol, you have to leave your fate in the hands of referees, they're the only ones who can determine the application of rules.
Umm... yeah. And Bernie lost to her. So what is the point you're attempting to make?
They say it shouldn't matter because they grow up their entire life dealing with some form of oppression or intolerance or flat out racism because of the color of their skin. Let me make it relatable. Let's say you have blue eyes. Your friends have blue eyes. But everyone with brown eyes or hazel eyes treats you a little different. Some give you shit over the fact that you have blue eyes, some are hostile even physical. Others don't seem to mind or care. And you are just living your life wondering why your eye color should change the way people treat you. It's kind of like that.
Look up donations year by year. It's on google. I'll wait.
.....riiight. He attacked her by saying she wasn't qualified to be president. He attacked her by saying she should apologize to those that lost loved ones in Iraq. He attacked her by saying she lacked judgement by voting for the war in Iraq, a vote that the majority of Dems voted for.   \nHe constantly attacked her to release the transcripts for her Wall Street speeches even though said speeches were available for free on YouTube. He constantly attacked her on being backed by Wall Street.  \nHe attacked the Clinton foundation, which was investigated for conflict of interest and was deemed a legal operation with a fantastic rating. \nHe attacked her on her 20 year old term "super predator" which he said was racist. He also blamed the lack of jobs on her trade agreements, even though automation is the leading factor in job loss, not globalization. Side note, he also just try to pass a bill that would allow Americans to buy drugs from Canada. That helps the American job market and economy how?  \nSanders attacked her on single payer system, even though they worked together to get it passed in the 90's.  I can go on and on but you get the point by now.
From the angles doesn't seem like he was looking at her, but fuck it, he'd still be able to hit it. Trump has no chance there
The fuck are you talking about? The term fake news has been around for decades. Is everyone in this thread 12?
 Because these videos haven't been heavily edited and doctored before?
And that's exactly what the FBI director said. Yet he knew there was no ill motive so pressing charges did not make sense. We currently have a White House which rallied off of these issues, and are not only repeating the same mistakes, but are doing an even worse job at maintaining the secure and safe passage of communication.
The fuck are you talking about, Trump is getting roasted left and right on /all 
3 investigations and no evidence.
Faker's a fucking God.
And you are the reason our country will crumble. 
You guys need to get a fucking life. Dude got pissy drunk and played ranked. Dumb move I agree. But he didn't get behind the wheel of a car. He didn't call any on his exes and cry. He didn't get into a fistfight or threaten anyone. He played a video game. This community has such a hard on for circle jerk attacking someone that I worry how lonely and socially awkward some of you are that this is the biggest issue in your lives. Go read a book or check out a news headline and get your head out of your asses.
As you say this 3-15 Muslims are reported dead in Quebec after 3 gunmen shot up a Mosque during night prayers. How about you start admitting Trump has brought the terror of white supremacy back into the spotlight. And if you can't do that then just shut the fuck up.
But he's still wrong in this case. You ask 10 everyday people who Nunes is the day after the fight, 10 people will still have no idea. Why? Because she's was talked about as much after the fight as she was before the fight.
You completely missed the point of his post.
So now we're adding in Europe even though we were discussing terrorism/white supremacy in America? Would you like to add any other continents?
Them blades. 
If you believe that Trump was a super villain then I'm sure you would have the majority agree with you. There is a mountain of evidence spanning decades showing how shady of an individual he is. But if you are trying to paint that same picture on Clinton...You need to read more sources then just the conspiracy theory message boards and actually research the woman's career and charities.
Last time I checked she won 21 states, and tied Barack Obama for the 2nd highest amount of votes received. But sure...it was all one state...
I appreciate your over the top reply, but that's silly. If the majority of Americans and majority of news networks' opinions were in one area over the other, then what is there to argue? 
You can see how happy Jack and Hai are to see each other in Genesis ep 2. Jack seems to truly care about his current and former players which is awesome to see. 
I'm sure those liberals would call it a true democracy.
To be fair Rayleigh didn't really get a chance to speak to Brook, he was playing his concert which then got broken up by the marines. The rest of the straw hats were more concerned about the exposition of the "new world".
Bill Clinton's approval ratings during his presidency hit an all time high during said Lewinsky trial. They climbed even higher the years following Bush's inauguration. Your comment has no factual evidence to back up your claims.
I love this manga, but there is a ton of directions that were taken that I can't stand. The Chimera arc as a whole is one. There is so much wrong with it that it drives me nuts. Strangely, I enjoyed the hell out of it, but in the way that I enjoy the Expendable movies or Fast and the Furious. I know they have a ton of problems, but it's fun so fuck it. \n \nGon's reaction to Kite was one. Yes he met Gon when young and his brief encounter with him made Gon want to become a hunter, but that was it. Mito would have been a better fit. If Mito was killed the reaction would have made sense.  \n\n
I would say the opposite about McCain. He already won reelection even with Trump badmouthing him on the campaign trail. McCain now knows his district is safe from booting him out so he's emboldened to speak out about everything Trump does. He's on the news talking almost everyday. Him and Lindsay Graham are the only two Repubs protesting the president.
I appreciate the fact that you are attempting so hard to make yourself believe that you don't have an issue with diversity. Your bias reeks throughout your response. Your privilege is read between the lines even though you strive to mask it. I feel pity for you. Your inner anger is misdirected. Your self-righteousness is misguided. Your reply is characteristic of one who is never challenged. You assume like you don't understand what a question is. I feel pity for you.  \nPS. Definition of Science:  \nthe state of knowing :  knowledge as distinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding.  \nIs that not the very description of collective data gathering?
She wasn't wrong.
He would've lost both the electoral and popular. What he should've done as soon as he it was projected how bad he was losing in the primary was turn to unifying the party against Trump instead of continuing to attack Clinton. He made the turn too late and fucked everyone over. Bernie shares blame in this Inauguration Day.
This is really stupid. So a random Starcraft player knows the business dealings of rival competitors? Or, his org lied to him about why they didn't finalize their CSGO team to save face about being banned?
I would say he stopped him for a second. But it was strange that you give Benn such an amazing entrance then have Kizaru just completely ignore him the next page.
Don't know why people are down voting this. I haven't watched the stream so I don't know if he started playing ranked and got progressively more drunk, or if he was shitfaced and then logged in. If the former then shame on him, play a smurf non ranked modes so you don't ruin the experience for others. If the latter then cut him some slack, people get pissy drunk and do stuff they don't intend to all the time. We should be more concerned at why he was that trashed to begin with then about feeding in league.
Yea, we know...the joke was that the 2nd half was stupid.
These people are trained to follow orders. If the commander in chief is ordering a strike, there is no refusal. The officer who is carrying the "football" authenticates the President's code and orders the strike. The officers receiving the order then launch the nukes. The President has final authority on the decision. Even if the officers believe he is wrong, he outranks them and his word is above all. Also, if that officer refuses, there are 3 others to fill in and that's not mentioning the VP's "football". This is not a Tom Clancy movie, no one will stop Trump if he decides to launch. No one.
That literally tells me nothing except you like to type fake news and pizzagate in large font. There is no source for that photo or context.
We don't, but if you say it enough times these days it becomes true.
Anyway we can get an updated download link? The one in the description of the youtube video is expired. Thanks
Interesting that you only picked the insults that are thrown at people on the political right in America.
Your defense is flawed, he knows exactly what the implications are. These are calculated actions. You can't get away with terrible decisions regarding the country in peacetime during normal circumstances. You can only have them stick in chaos, when the rules are changing everyday and nobone knows what's coming next. He's been doing this since day one and American citizens have been played like a fiddle ever since.
It doesn't make you bad, it just gives you many opportunities that minorities are not given. Some white people understand that they have these extra opportunities, or privilege. They then try to help groups that are disenfranchised or discriminated against. While others pretend it doesn't exist and say they deserve more.   \nWhat side are you on?
Could be a mistranslation, but Hotori and Kotori state that Sanji and Luffy killed their brother Satori in Sky island.
Don't forget his dismantling of big business. He aggressively went after trusts and other organizations that were wielding immense amount of power in the US with little regard of its citizens. Trump on the other hand wants to deregulate and give more power to corporations.
Game 3
The mainstream media typically leans in the way that the majority of it's citizens do. A bit left-center. Who "won" the debates isn't up for interpretation, all polls showed Clinton outperforming Trump. What we saw in this election was Hillary out shining Trump in the traditional aspects of a presidential race (debates, fundraisers, policy) and winning the popular vote, yet losing the electoral college. Furthermore, I would challenge your claim on Cooper getting "pissed off". As a moderator you are supposed to keep the debaters and the crowd under control. Being firm and to the point is not anger.
She is a First Lady. She has to respect the peaceful transfer of power. She made it a point that it was important while Trump dismissed it. She would appear two face if she didn't show up. It took a hell of a lot more courage for her to be there in that situation then not go.
Don't hold your breath.
Exactly, you approach management with your dissatisfaction and if nothing is resolved you look for another job. The fact that 0 players on TSM approached Reginald with displeasure at what was happening is looking like a damning black mark on their argument.
Hey Jack, just to let you know you are definitely one of the stand up guys in esports and have been for quite some time. 
He had a bad showing in the playoffs against SSG but he played really well in the group stage.
So how many of those emails were marked top secret? I'll give you the answer. 22. 22 out of close to 100,000. The FBI investigated and found no reason to press charges. The reason has been stated, they all do this.     Including Trump. He is currently tweeting on a 5 year old Samsung without two step verification. Yet no one is saying a thing. The white house has already set up a private server and the press secretary tweeted out his temporary password. Let's not kid ourselves and pretend the email thing was about national security. That was the lie people told themselves to find a reason to distrust Hillary.
So, you are telling us in plain English that diversity is a bad thing? Let's look past your sugar-coated disdain for diversity by complaining that "it shouldn't be at the top of the page." Who cares where it is. Seriously. Does it offend you in some way? Are your feelings being hurt because it was one of the first sections written? Are you rights being trampled on because the march is trying to be inclusive? Science is an all inclusive field. The more knowledge contributing to the collective is the sole purpose of Science. Diversity only helps Science, it never hurts it. How do you not understand that constant truth?
Not the President-elect
You are underestimating the costs of healthcare in America. The ambulance trip alone would be close to $1,000. Everything else would probably hit a combined $10k. 
And your constructive outlet was assuming he was from a Central American country and calling it a banana narco state?? You're like a rapist giving dating advice. 
You do realize she won the popular vote by almost 3million?
I told you the website...
You are vetted for years for that position, you don't say no to the president. If you do you are replaced on the spot.
Disagree completely, this league has to show consistency in how they hand out techs for rim hanging. I don't agree with them penalizing celebrations but if that's the rule you can't just ignore those rules because it's Lebron in Cleveland.
Nothing credible.
???? Most polls had Hillary at over 300 electoral votes. She handily won on the vast majority of polls. The election results came as a shock to just about anyone following politics. Hence why it was called the biggest surprise win in presidential history. What are you even talking about? 
I don't think so, but I think we might need to see a gif. You know, for science...
That could be what Oda was referencing when creating the character, but even then Red Sonja was sexualized in the 70's as well. Those outfits in Conan has no historical significance whatsoever. Fighting in tiny outfits with zero protection is how you die young back then.
I disagree with your disagreement. The PEA is giving a more stable foundation to play and make more money. Let's not kid ourselves, the players are here for the money. It seems like a lot of these players were not explained the key differences before signing off on their rights were being taken away. The teams seem to be attempting to create a more structured and lucrative system that is a natural evolution in eSports. Lack of dialogue between players and management is what caused all this drama.
Seriously? Open secrets has him receiving $100k from the medical industry in 2014. Booker, who you claim is in their pocket, less then $50k the same year.   Here's my issue with Bernie or bust people, you don't understand how to get shit done. You need to learn how to compromise and build allies, not try to tear down any public figure who doesn't do exactly what you want. 
A mosque was burned down in Texas last night. As we speak right now there our reports from Quebec that 3-15 Muslims have been gunned down while at night prayers in their own mosque by 3 gunmen. Who exactly is safe?
Obviously Booker can't say that the reason he opposes the law is because people may lose their jobs in his state and then won't vote for him. Just like Bernie won't do anything to piss off IBM employees. They make up 25% of manufacturing jobs in VT.   \nAlso to speak on your first point, Sanders was given double the amount Booker was from the medical industry in 2014. There was no presidential race that year last time I checked. 
The Supreme Court ruled that hate speech or speech that incites violence is not protected by the 1st amendment.
Lol
Because if the promotion is unwilling to push their champions while they are champions then what is the point of the belts? Just get rid of them and make it a popularity contest. Everyone understands that entertainment draws a crowd (see Mcgregor) but he is a 2-division champ. Eddie Alvarez got a lot of press before the fight yet everyone knew he wasn't the draw. Nunes got some of the least coverage I've seen for a defending champion in the 15 years I've been watching MMA.
You're glorifying this dude a bit too much. Modern Jesus? He didn't go on a hunger strike or help the poor, he leaked information then fled the country and is living comfortably in Russia. I agree that he did the right thing in releasing the information, but saying he's the greatest hero alive is a joke when there are people that run into burning buildings to save lives and soldiers who risk their bodies to protect freedoms. Dial it back a bit.
True, but remember the Rumbar pirates had lost half of their crew at that point to disease including their captain. Also their ship doctor was killed in a poison attack to enemy pirates. Since they never disclose who they were, we can only imagine how powerful that crew was. Don't forget that Mihawk floated all the way to east blue once before, so not everyone in Paradise is a weakling or rookie.
If it was the straw hats they would've been wiped out completely lol. Still crazy that like Shanks, Luffy keeps his crew small.
4 million votes were rigged? 4 million. Were they illegals that voted or maybe people bused in from Massachusetts?
While I agree with you I understand why the government cannot forgive him. He escaped to another country, one which we are extremely hostile towards atm. Not only that but he began spreading the gospel of self privacy and tyrannical governments yet saying nothing negative about the country which is hosting him. I understand both positions. Snowden had to save his own ass and the option for asylum was limited, finally down to Russia. He now can't bite the hand that protects him.   \nNow that the US has pardoned Manning after being sentenced and serving time they aren't in the position to accept Snowden after all the evasion. Unless Trump pardons, Snowden and Assange will not being seeing the US any time soon.
So Fox News..
Why good luck? Why are you already establishing an ending that fits your views instead of allowing this to play out and assessing this development as new information comes in. Seriously, a simple advice would be to open yourself up to the idea that your pre constructed ideas may be wrong. As Morpheus said, "Free your mind".
True, but they are put in outfits and shown in angles that sexualizes their curves and what not.
He's always been top 2 ADC since he entered the scene. You can pull up the stats and see how dominant he's been for a long time. He just doesn't talk shit, never has, so he gets forgotten about quickly.
That is not how science works at all. You're claiming that taking someone's word for it is science based. False. If Scott is telling the truth then we can believe him when either the players come forward and back up his claims or he produces chat logs proving he's correct. Right now Reginald has the upper hand because he has produced evidence. Google the scientific method.
I would disagree. That man wakes up in the middle of the night to lash out at people using any medium he has available. Now he has the nuclear codes. Before you say, "wait there are checks and balances in place before he can initiate a launch" I hate to break it to you, but there are none. He has sole authority to make that decision.
So many people still don't understand this simple truth. Ford is investing over $700 million into the area but how much of it is going towards upgrading their assembly lines for automation. They say they will be adding 700 factory jobs. Well the payroll for those workers would make up a single digit percentage of the money being invested. We saw with the Carrier deal that the $16 million they promised to invest in Indiana will go towards Automation, eliminating the jobs they just received insane tax cuts to save. The job of the line worker will go extinct and soon, as frightening as that is to hear.
He claimed SoftBank has never invested in America before. Strange since I worked for Sprint at the time when Softbank acquired 78%  of the company for almost 25 billion dollars. That's a year before they acquired New York startup Dramafever. He claimed 1,100 jobs were saved in Indiana when in reality the actual number is 730. The same number the local union was negotiating. But, don't let facts get in the way of your shitpost.
Hate crimes against minorities and religious groups happen every day. The FBI cited that hate crimes against Muslims rose by 70% in 2016. "American Nationalists" is just a dressed up term for White Supremacy and they've been responsible for countless deaths for over 100 years in this country.
One Piece became much more sexualized after the timeskip. Female body types now fit two molds, Rebecca-ish or Big Mom-ish.
I disagree, Hillary was the definition of someone looking to change the world from a young age. Her valedictorian speech was in direct opposition of the conservative politician who was the key speaker. I think she learned being the most just and smartest in the room doesn't necessarily make you the most powerful. And to make change you need power.     \n  \nLook at her history in Arkansas. She was trying to make change for young girls and women's rights yet they voted bill out of the office because why was Hillary talking and not in the kitchen. I think this impacted them heavily.  \nNext time around she came back with blonde hair and a winning smile and they won the governorship again. But she had the power and would smartly get things passed.  \nBernie never learned this, hence why his efficiency in terms of being politician was never talked about. Clintons change the world, Kennedys change the world. Now, fucking with shame, Trumps change the world. 
If you think that's true I got a well to sell ya.
J.k. Shit on them all, she's the trolliest twitter celebrity out.
Agreed. Dressrosa was tough to watch with people nearby because of Rebecca's super ecchi outfit. The show has definitely taken a turn into making the vast majority of females being extremely "well equipped" or having a model type body. Take a look at background characters in random scenes. Even those females are very busty or hourglass like. 
He's 100% wrong. They spent 0 time on Nunes after the fight. Only thing you saw on the headline was 48 seconds, Rousey, knockout.
Because those worked out so well 
What ideology is being pushed by the OP, other than "If you value x, look at the literature"?
Was George talking about people who benefited from or had the power to oppose jihad? Because Priebus can oppose white supremacists in the white house.
I feel like the Mustang is just asking to get the low-budget 80's Honda CRX treatment, with a ridiculous flame paint job, glowy LEDs, and holes drilled at random for "weight reduction". It sounds like the repair mechanics might actually allow that last part!
Wow, some people really need to prove they're superior to anyone who dares express happiness.\n\nEdit: Nevermind, I just expect everyone to be horrible on the internet.
"While the Baroque rules of chess could only have been created by humans, the rules of Go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play Go." \n\n-- Edward Lasker, chess grandmaster\n\nI'd love to see Go in-universe. There'd be something very satisfying about the fact that such an ancient and simple game still stuck around, especially if aliens developed it (or something similar) independently. Even better, it's extremely simple to teach the rules to new players, while still being incredibly complex to master.\n\nAs much as I like the Witcher, something like Gwent is a pretty terrible game to play against other humans, in my opinion. So if we create our own game for SC, I hope a lot of thought goes into it - though I'd rather steal an existing game like Go and let that thought go into the main game :)
What does that mean?
Yeah, I like the "no passive income" thing, especially while logged off (though that'll be interesting to see for factories). I just like the idea of being able to get comfy in space, and maybe go put in my laundry if I'm willing to take a risk. The idea of contraband AI sounds like it could be interesting, though.
I made it across the country this summer mainly on peanut butter, honey, granola, and dried (and/or canned) fruit, though I did add bread in there that probably included butter. I stopped at restaurants and ate other stuff sometimes, but would have been fine with just the essentials above, I think. That assumes you're cool with insect products, I guess. No prep required besides mixing, and won't go bad!
It's not discrimination based on any protected category, so I'm guessing it's legal.
By all means, make a sign for that! It's a totally relevant issue, just like social inequality or any other issue where science is informing policy way less than it should.
The whole point of the study is to learn about an unknown, though. Math is great, you can infer all sorts of things from a sample, but you can't correct for sampling bias beyond just limiting the claims you make.
It's still like 40% of the electorate, which is terrifying.
Oh! Thanks for the correction. Good to know!
Every "race" is still metahuman in Shadowrun, so it's not like the elves are totally separate. It brings up a lot about what they actually gained or lost, if anything, by becoming "awakened".
I had never done a tour besides a one-night test ride before going from Oregon to New York last summer. I got my bike for $150 at a swap and beat it up on singletrack before that, though I did inject $70-ish for touring tires. "Ride what you have" is really good advice, especially considering that there are bike shops all over the place where you can replace bits if you really need to.
I've been swooped by these guys three times now while on my bike - not actually attacked, but clearly trying to scare me off. They usually perch nearby after that and I get to ogle them.

I don't think that's true. It's difficult, and I don't know how to do it en masse, but addressing that kind of thing has to at least be tried.
There's definitely some kind of brigade going on recently. I don't know what started it though.
Everything works in the new, post-truth world!
China's pretty big, I hear.
If I remember right, you can avoid killing anyone for a very long time in this game even as a decker.
Yeah, I think being killed during a game is totally appropriate for the universe. Maybe your ELO rating sticks with your character, not your account, so jealous competitors might want you assassinated! Imagine high-level players traveling with security escorts...
An immigration ban will not stop terrorism. Plenty of home grown terrorists, and it's not that hard to sneak in from Canada. Not to mention all the informers and economic benefit we'd pass up with a crude total ban.
Nah, just pointing out that upgrade is in the title, I think :)
I agree - but no matter what, it'll still be said about any protest ever, so don't be disappointed when people just assume there was trash and complain about it anyway. I spent most of the time at our local march picking up what tiny bits of trash I could find (there weren't many!). Of course, people still complained.
I feel like that would plump them up more.
I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. I hope you know that you're awesome even though nothing will ever be enough for your mom. Remember that you don't have any responsibility to maintain contact with her, especially if it makes it more difficult to be the awesomest person you can be for you and your SO!\n\nFor an example of how detached N-parents can be: as the golden child, my mom believes that both my girlfriend and I have PhDs. I don't, and repeatedly told her so before breaking contact - but her sister's son *does* have a PhD, and I must be better than her sister's kid, so I must have a PhD too.
I bet there's going to be a lot of massive insurance claims when these ships make it into the game. Is there a plan for that? 4.0+, I imagine?
Only if it's well-designed, I feel. Something like Gwent would be a huge letdown to me.
That's why I said "the bigger picture". Women do benefit in conviction rates and child custody, which are both important, but they lose out almost everywhere else. Point is, the idea that women are weak and should be protected definitely hurts them.
I rode across the US this summer, and my emotional state was a *huge* factor in how fast/far I could ride in a day. So I bet this person just got way faster to make up for it.\n\nI can't understand why they didn't stop and say hi, though. What's the point of distance cycling if you can't enjoy cool stuff you come across?
I totally disagree. All those things can and should be approached from a scientific standpoint, and it'd be anti-scientific to ignore the literature on them just because of our own feelings.
Would that actually work? My mom would just pretend she didn't know what any of those words meant, and repeat whatever she said before until I stopped trying to engage, which she would take as agreement.
I'm surprised I had to dig this far for the Ben Carson reference
Game packages with something higher than an Aurora/Mustang, though? My impression was that all ships above starters weren't for sale after release. Ship upgrades specifically say that they must be used before release, assumedly for this reason.
Fresh out after the election, I guess
I gave you an example last time you asked. I don't know why you're limiting this to "government, political, or court system", but okay:\n\nGovernment: Look at all the ridiculous laws surrounding abortion.\nPolitics: Look at the ratio of men to women in leadership positions.\nCourts: Look at how many excuses are made for young, white men that rape women.
Sure, but not even she expects anything to come of it.
Newb here: what's OAC?
If this person is like other gender-fluid people I've known or heard about, the different modes aren't different personalities like dissociative identity disorder, so the modes wouldn't feel anything about each other as separate people. Maybe you're just asking how they feel about whichever mode they're not currently in, though, and I'm curious about that too.
Why do people keep bringing up Hillary in response to criticisms of Trump? She's out of the picture now.
Everybody in the Spirit Cooking community worries about catching it.
This is [Topaz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIBW3v5_8Eprm7ewagJvgw), he's very well taken care of :) 
Maybe, but enough to rig the entire judicial system against men? Feminists aren't to blame for this.
"The woman vote" != feminists, though.
I think you meant "more females than males" in your first sentence.
That's a good point. I guess those 10 ships are all very vulnerable without someone to respond to threats, but that's probably not enough to make it unprofitable. The contraband AI idea would help since the vulnerable ships are now targets for bounty hunters *and* pirates, but it still doesn't seem like a complete solution. Maybe mining lasers can be automated, but not tractors, so that active players can swipe ore mined by passive ones who aren't paying attention?\n\n
Ha, my mom also had (has?) the idea that I'm going to buy her a vacation home, as well as a lot of the paranoia stuff. She's also great at convincing herself of things that aren't true.\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this, but I'm glad you're going to therapy and I'm glad your mom hasn't managed to get the family on her side!
9/23 is about 0.05?
You really can't think of any task that women are considered incompetent at? Driving, navigating, math, business, science... 
I like the idea of a Dragonfly racer who is such a purist that they won't even own another vehicle - they're super famous, but have to bum rides to get anywhere, and adoring fans always compete to get there first.
They seem to have the right focus on that, to me, at least in avoiding boring stuff. "Rule of cool" and all. No matter what, though, there will be some long flight times, and the ability to check out for some of that would be nice.
Invisible, not invincible.
Thanks! It's encouraging to hear specifics about performance improvements that are in the pipeline. My biggest concern is that the sheer amount of info that needs to be passed around will make the game impossible to implement the way they want to. That was why Eve didn't even have free flight, right?
I agree that it's important to not fall into the trap of "I voted for Clinton so she must be great". I'm just wary of people who might be trying to excuse Trump by saying "but Hillary", basically relying on tactics that were only slightly relevant even during the election.
You think prison changes people for the better, more than rehab?
And then takes another 5 minutes cleaning the blender.
Damn! Thanks!
Who says it has to be science *or* social justice? There's no need to pretend that everyone here agrees on every detail of every issue - we have a uniting issue, that's what's important. There's no reason to quash everything else.\n\nPlus, social justice and science are very related. To do science properly, you need to give credit where it's due and recognize the barriers that different people face. To understand social injustice, you need to do good science to make sure you're not just acting on feelings. We shouldn't pretend that science and society are somehow separated - the ivory tower image isn't accurate or helpful.
I think that sums up all of us, man...
Gotta love *24*. People stay up for 24+ hours and don't get tired or hungry and don't need to use the bathroom.
I don't think that applies to yes-or-no questions and I doubt they would have used it here, but I'm out of my depth on that.\n\nEdit: Wikipedia says "[In the general case, selection biases cannot be overcome with statistical analysis of existing data alone, though Heckman correction may be used in special cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias#Mitigation)". From what I understand, the Heckman correction assumes that the sample comes from one tail of a normal distribution, and then tries to estimate the mean of that normal distribution. I think that means that yes-or-no questions won't work, because there's no trend to get information from.
Thank you. The social sciences need more support - people bash them as "based on feelings" or whatever, but the whole value of sociology is to *avoid* acting on feelings, just like any other science.\n\nI say this as a physicist turned engineer, not just promoting myself.
I'm all for that. I guess I'm just seeing conservatives respond to criticisms of Trump by saying "but Hillary" as if that somehow makes Trump excusable. Hillary owes Wall St, but Trump *is* Wall St. They can both suck without being equivalent or somehow making the other better.
It was called a solidarity rally on the FB page, and specifically avoided shutting down the airport for this reason.
You have no idea whether a ban would have stopped those attacks. First, there wasn't a big concern about this stuff before 9/11, so should we just preemptively ban travel from all countries that *might* wish us harm? For the others, it's a huge stretch to say that the attacks wouldn't have happened without immigration. Plenty of media still gets in, for example. And taking refugees is *way* different than a complete ban from a country.\n\nAlso, you're still completely ignoring the negatives of such a broad order. We had people who we thoroughly vetted that we just told "nope, nevermind" because Trump didn't give a shit. Universities certainly felt an impact, too. And, of course, there's the message that we just hate the Muslim world, all 1.8 billion people, which confirms ISIS's narrative and will probably make it a lot harder to find informants and translators.
"I think you're one classless mofo" - how is that "academically relevant"?
You can't magically make a sample somehow reflect a population better than it did when you selected that sample.
Science definitely should inform policy and governance way more than it does, and that's pretty much the entire point of this march. At the march, I hope and expect to see marine biologists telling me how science should inform policy about fish stocks and biodiversity.
Not defending Trump, but every president is "suspected" of being a lizard person at some point, so...
Definitely part of the worldwide conspiracy. One of you is a spy, and the other knows something important.
Is there a good science memes sub to send them to, especially when explaining why their content was removed?
The first one, i think, making fun of the vast majority of Australia that is just nothingness.
Same here, in case that's more encouragement! "It takes a village to raise a child" and all that, beyond just daycare. And then you're not leaving one person alone with all the responsibilities if you want to take some time for yourself!
I like how that uses factories to produce missions for everyone as well as credits for the owner! Thanks for the replies.
Do you actually know that?
We elected a celebrity, though. I think people take them seriously whether they should or not.
That's already in the plans, I was just wondering if this happened to anyone else. The cops gave me the car back because the buyer was arrested for something else, but it's still legally in the buyer's name and apparently there's nothing the cops can do about that, which makes zero sense to me.
+1 for Golden Harbor. Also their Facebook account is the most uplifting thing ever.
Ride around it unless it's signalling to get back into the lane. It helps to get out into the lane early so that they can see you in the mirror before you pass.
Actually, I could totally see that being a thing for high-level Sataball players, which would be fascinating. Especially because I bet they and their opposition will be rolling in credits.
Disaster movies are interesting, too. Doesn't mean we should aim to recreate them.
We're upset about that, too, but leaks from the FBI are a whole other level. 
"All in your head" doesn't mean it's not real, just like a broken bone being "all in your leg" is still a problem. And the experience of hating yourself despite having a seemingly good situation is extremely common. The counseling center has a lot of experience with this :)
I'm assuming this isn't the case, because it would break the question - but could drug pill emulate any other pill?
I know subreddits don't define the movements they're attached to, but it's worth noting that the sidebar in r/altright explicitly says "...the Alt-Right promotes White Identity and White Nationalism."\n\nEdit: Just saw this was alluded to in OP's post. Leaving it for now because I think it's interesting that, at least on Reddit, they very clearly specify this in bold and italics.
Marching about anything isn't science, yet here we are. I don't understand.
I really like the idea of being a space bum, honestly. I was hoping I could buy a starter package that came with no ship, and then see if I can earn one by working as crew or as a merc.
Are you twelve?
If you think it's unrealistic, you don't have to be an ass about it. 
My two cents: open communication *really* helps. Everyone needs to feel comfortable saying "I felt jealous about x," and everyone else needs to feel like that isn't an attack on whoever was doing x. Basically: face the jealousy together, treating it as an external issue rather than an interpersonal conflict.\n\nEdit: This applies in any relationship, really.
Shoutout to the counseling center, too, depending on the kind of support you're looking for. They're very LGBTQ-friendly in my experience, though I'm saying this as an ally.
It's also bad to just assume that your viewpoint is the objective truth, though. Not that you are OP are necessarily doing that, just saying that this is an open topic.
Do you really believe that? You realize how insulting that is, right? \n\nRegardless, any faction can spin their stance as "for the kids" and they'd have the same power. There's nothing unique about feminism when it comes to painting issues favorably.

The mantidfly [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NV3EK4YsP8) is a good example as you can see how it moves its antennae similar to a wasp, and even tucks its forearms into its body to further resemble a large wasp's head.

Here's a Facebook post of his from earlier this week. Kinda long, but gives you a good sense of how he's been coping up to this point:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n"Thanks, grief.\nThanks for making depression look like the buzzing little bully it always was. Depression is the tallest kid in the 4th grade, dinging rubber bands off the back of your head and feeling safe on the playground, knowing that no teacher is coming to help you.\nBut grief? Grief is Jason Statham holding that 4th grade bully's head in a toilet and then fucking the teacher you've got a crush on in front of the class. Grief makes depression cower behind you and apologize for being such a dick.\n\nIf you spend 102 days completely focused on ONE thing you can achieve miracles. Make a film, write a novel, get MMA ripped, kick heroin, learn a language, travel around the world. Fall in love with someone. Get 'em to love you back.\n\nBut 102 days at the mercy of grief and loss feels like 102 years and you have shit to show for it. You will not be physically healthier. You will not feel "wiser." You will not have "closure." You will not have "perspective" or "resilience" or "a new sense of self." You WILL have solid knowledge of fear, exhaustion and a new appreciation for the randomness and horror of the universe. And you'll also realize that 102 days is nothing but a warm-up for things to come.\n\nAnd...\nYou will have been shown new levels of humanity and grace and intelligence by your family and friends. They will show up for you, physically and emotionally, in ways which make you take careful note, and say to yourself, "Make sure to try to do that for someone else someday." Complete strangers will send you genuinely touching messages on Facebook and Twitter, or will somehow figure out your address to send you letters which you'll keep and re-read 'cause you can't believe how helpful they are. And, if you're a parent? You'll wish you were your kid's age, because the way they embrace despair and joy are at a purer level that you're going to have to reconnect with, to reach backwards through years of calcified cynicism and ironic detachment. Lose your cool, and you're saved.\n\nMichelle McNamara got yanked off the planet and out of life 102 days ago. She left behind an amazing unfinished book, about a horrific series of murders that everyone -- including the retired homicide detectives she worked with -- was sure she'd solve. The Golden State Killer. She gave him that name, in an article for Los Angeles Magazine. She was going to figure out the real name behind it.\n\nShe left Alice, her 7 year-old daughter. But not before putting the best parts of her into Alice, like beautiful music burned onto a CD and sent out into the void on a spaceship.\nAnd she left me. 102 days into this.\n\nI was face-down and frozen for weeks. It's 102 days later and I can confidently say I have reached a point where I'm crawling. Which, objectively, is an improvement. Maybe 102 days later I'll be walking.\n\nAny spare energy I've managed to summon since April 21st I've put toward finishing Michelle's book. With a lot of help from some very amazing people. It will come out. I will let you know. It's all her. We're just taking what's there and letting it tell us how to shape it. It's amazing.\n\nAnd I'm going to start telling jokes again soon. And writing. And acting in stuff and making things I like and working with friends on projects and do all the stuff I was always so privileged to get to do before the air caught fire around me and the sun died. It's all I knew how to do before I met Michelle. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do now without her.\n\nAnd not because, "It's what Michelle would have wanted me to do." For me to even presume to know what Michelle would have wanted me to do is the height of arrogance on my part. That was one of the many reasons I so looked forward to growing old with her. Because she was always surprising me. Because I never knew what she'd think or what direction she'd go.\n\nOkay, I'll start being funny again soon. What other choice do I have? Reality is in a death spiral and we seem to be living in a cackling, looming nightmare-swamp. We're all being dragged into a shadow-realm of doom by hateful lunatics who are determined to send our planet careening into oblivion.\n\nHey, there's that smile I was missing!"

I think the difference is obama was attempting to work with a congress that would take a shit on any ideas he had, if if they were their ideas. People applauded obama for finally doing SOMETHING, anything, to work around a congress that impeded him at every juncture. Trump on the other hand has congress in his pocket and chooses not to work with them and instead do things through EOs. Which seems silly to me since all of them can be undone by the next president, whereas if they were law the next president would have to work with congress to change them.

And they don't even need all 50 states or even 2/3s to ratify, they just need enough populous states adding up to 270 electoral votes to agree to give their votes to the winner of the national popular vote. Seems like the path of least resistance to actually rid us of this anti-democratic relic.

I was in Prague and a cute Czech girl wrote something on my arm when I was passed out. I asked her what it meant she said "cute boy." I assumed she was fucking with me and immediately went up to one of my Czech friends to ask what it meant. Turns out it was "cute boy." By the time I went to find her she was gone. 
There is a movement toward allocating electoral votes to whoever won the popular vote. That way we don't need a constitutional amendment. If enough states ratify it we don't even need the whole country, just enough for 270 electoral votes. We're already 2/3 of the way there. It's called he national popular vote interstate compact. 
I would say make a list of all the majors you could see yourself doing, even if that list is long it still narrows it down from "everything." Then start looking at that list with severe scrutiny, could you actually see yourself working on [blank] for the next three years? What about the next 10 years? What brings you the most joy? What can make you the most money (if that's important to you)? If you can't narrow it down any further, ya, put the list in a hat and pick one. If the first one you pick isn't acceptable, you didn't scrutinize enough in step 1. The truth is anything you study will be valuable to you in whatever career you end up in. My parents were both Chemistry majors and never used their degrees after college. I went to film school and I'm working in the industry now. Don't let anyone tell you what you care about or what's important. Make your own decision and know that you may change it down the line.

"Return"
I've been listening to the audiobook and now I know how it's spelled! 
I know. I'm not eager for a constitutional crisis (although it could be worth it to stop trump). I just meant the electoral college vote hasn't technically happened yet. 
Mitch McConnell assured the american people that his goal (and therefore the goal of the senate republicans) was to make Obama a one term president. Not to make things better for americans, but to make sure Obama didn't win in 2012 (which he didn't even succeed in doing). And let's not forget the filibuster became a guarantee under Obama. Any piece of legislation that didn't come from republicans was automatically filibustered, meaning the democrats needed 60 votes to do anything. This is obstructionism and not Obama's fault. I'm not saying that expanded executive power was right as a result, just that Republicans did unprecedented levels of blocking in order to forestall any progress by congress.

Same! Congrats to you!
The electoral college is a relic from when each state ruled itself more or less and spoke with one voice. The purpose initially was, at least in part, to protect against a single highly populated state ruling the others. There is no worry of that anymore, the federal government rules the others in most matters. We are all just Americans now, not Californians or Virginians. In that case it must represent each of us in the decision for who should be our leader. One person, one vote. One of the founding principles of the country. A vote for president in Wyoming counts almost 4 times as much as mine in California and that is wrong. \n\nIt's an arcane and undemocratic system meant to keep distance between the mob-ocracy and its leaders. We no longer need that distance, we can trust the country with the popular vote. It's the founding fathers ruling from the grave. Even they wouldn't have wanted it this way. \n\nEDIT: Also it's not throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The republic stays intact, how it is. It's not like we're all gonna be voting for each bill individually. I'm just saying when it comes to who represents us on the world stage, we should all have an equal voice in that process. We're throwing out the turd and leaving the baby in the bath. 
Democracy would be the person who got the most votes being president. 
Just start walking in a direction. Any direction. It will lead you somewhere and anywhere is better than stuck at home doing nothing. Starting is always the hardest part. 
Don't forget if trump leaves the office having been impeached by republicans, his voters will go with him.

What I don't get about your argument is you keep using the word "state" as if it's a monolith. As if everyone in California or Texas thinks the same way and can therefore be represented as one whole. What is "the California stance" anyway? There are plenty of republicans in California who would argue with you about whatever you think it is. Your statements totally negate the minority votes of dissent in each of those states, just like the electoral college does. Again, it comes from a time when the states were like individual little countries that ruled themselves and would vote as one for the president. We no longer live in those times, the united states is one country now and each state has very little autonomy. We should account for this in how we choose our leader. \n\n>Clinton won between 20 and 21 states depending on how you want to count Maine. Trump won the remaining 29-30. Are you saying that the will of California, New York, and Virginia should trump (forgive the pun) the will of 30 states?\n\nNo. I'm saying the will of 66 million people should trump the will of 63 million people. Seriously, how can you argue with that? It's simple. Whoever gets the most votes wins. We're all one country now, my vote should count the same as yours, no matter where we live. \n\n>Also, just for reference, California is still worth the most of any state in the country with 55 electoral votes. That makes it worth more than Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma combined. California has massive voting power as fitting its population count, but the electoral system prevents one state from invalidating the voices of ten.\n\nSee here's where the math really matters. California has around 39 million people and 55 electoral votes. Meaning each Californian's vote is worth about .00000141025 electoral votes. Wyoming has a population of about 600,000 and 3 electoral votes. That means a vote in Wyoming is worth .000005 electoral votes. Meaning every vote in Wyoming is worth about 3.5 TIMES every vote in California. This applies, in varying degrees, to all those other states you mentioned. A vote for president in California is actually the least powerful vote in the country. The electoral system does the opposite of what you say it does, it allows states to invalidate the voices of others. 
Chat rooms. I was in them when I was way too young and my parents had no idea how to prepare me. 
I like that better than what we have now but there's still a slim possibility of someone winning the presidency while losing the popular vote. If you're going to allocate things proportionally why not just count each vote? I think it would totally change voter turnout as well because all of a sudden the votes of the people in safe blue and red states would matter again. Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California will have a voice again. It's good for everyone.
Genius! I'm gonna do this

Ya I get that, but that's why we have congress. So the more rural areas can get representation. The executive though, should be elected by a plurality of raw voters, otherwise the democracy is broken.\n\nIt'd be like if Illinois' governor was actually elected by each county getting one vote and whoever wins that county wins that one vote. There's 102 counties in Illinois and only one or two include Chicago proper. The rural counties would have a huge advantage, even if the counties were giving proportional votes because all of Chicago's population is concentrated in one county.\n\nIt's the same with the electoral college and sparsely populated states. That's how Trump can win the electoral college while losing the popular vote by 1.7% (over 3 million votes). Her voters are concentrated in states she's already winning. It's an undemocratic system that gives a lot more power to people who live in rural states.

I'm not defending whoopi but it seems to me that Milo was defending the very act of pedophilia itself whereas whoopi wasn't defending rape but the people accused of it. If whoopi had said that rape could be beneficial for the victim my guess is she would have had a similar backlash. But fuck her anyway, nobody should be defending either of these nuts. 
Ya but quick play is more exciting to watch IMO, works much better for the long form doc format, even for casual players. 
Fourth dimensional perception and the idea of time as one thing that we move through is the main thing I saw in common. I feel like interstellar did it cheaply in a way that felt shoehorned and too easy, whereas this felt earned. 
Except that if everything went off the popular vote it would instead be swing VOTERS that would matter. Wouldn't that be better? Candidates fighting for voters in the middle of the political spectrum rather than voters in a specific geographic area.\n\nThe point is, a vote for president in Wyoming counts almost 4 times as much as mine in California and that is wrong.
Not necessarily. The states could just agree to give their electoral votes to the popular vote winner. You wouldn't even need all the states to agree, just enough to hit 270 electoral votes. There's a bill I think called the interstate popular vote compact or something. They already have states totaling 65% of the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the presidency. Call your state government!
You're a little brother aren't you?
>1) It's not right to simply blame Congress and say Obama was right to break the system because he tried it and didn't like it.\n\nIt's not that he didn't like it, it's that they didn't like him. Mitch McConnell assured the american people that his goal (and therefore the goal of the senate republicans) was to make Obama a one term president. Not to make things better for americans, but to make sure Obama didn't win in 2012 (which he didn't even succeed in doing). And let's not forget the filibuster became a guarantee under Obama. Any piece of legislation that didn't come from republicans was automatically filibustered, meaning the democrats needed 60 votes to do anything. This is obstructionism and not Obama's fault. I'm not saying that expanded executive power was right as a result, just that Republicans did unprecedented levels of blocking in order to forestall any progress by congress.
Wow ya man. This was me to a fucking tee in college. Totally did the anonymous poem shtick and lost a group of friends cause I wouldn't stop creeping out over one of them. Finally gave up on all that and just lived for myself for a while, didn't try to date. Then a friend fell into my lap (literally) and we got engaged last month! 
Looks like it could be good, especially for chess lovers. 
Except if there are more people in those 3 or 4 states to outnumber the people in the other 46, that's democracy for you. What we have now is a step in between that doesn't do anything except invalidate 90% of the votes cast (any blue state or red state) and makes swing states insanely important for no reason. My vote should matter as much as one in Ohio or Florida but as it stands now it doesn't. The proposed alternative is actual democracy, how is the electoral college less flawed than "whoever gets the most votes wins"?

I read this too. Definitely in HAUNTED. interesting story. A bit on the nose with the names but that's his style. 
Ya there's no way he could still see it at that distance. Likely he is looking at the screen on the controller to tell where it is and how to fly back. But like others have said there is a "return to home" button on the controller that will call the drone back to the location it took off from. 
I fucking love this. Do you have the template?
Ya, Adam and Eve or something. The government discovers all the souls of the dead are having an orgy on Venus and everyone decides to abandon earth and live on Venus forever. Except two lovers who start the world over again. Cool story.

My wife threw out my shoes once because they were next to the trash and were dirty. WE WENT HIKING. 
The dark side uses cheap tricks all the time.  Palpatine's seduction of Anakin was basically, "Remember that nightmare that you're calling a premonition?  I can make sure your imagination never becomes reality."\n\nIt absolutely is stretching, but that's what a long con is.  If they do this, it also opens doors in IX for them to have Kylo turn on Snoke when he realizes the truth. Of course that would be another echo in itself of Vader's turn on the Emperor aboard the second Death Star.
Count me in, fingers crossed!
I feel your pain, I did the same thing. Try Infamous First Light
This makes me think we get to see a First Order ground assault against a "funeral"/remembering of the Senate in the Hosnian system.....
I like it, very much, but I can't believe it's real until there's some significant proof
What?  No, that's not what I said at all.  Trumpy Leia is WAY out of character. I meant forces her going because she feels in a way responsible and everyone goes along because she's the boss.
Very bothered.  It looks like a small golf course's pro shop, but the google maps bit had no course that I can see close by.
Found a second one underground.  Way deep
I really hope Bungie doesn't pull the team up. It'd be the Halo Elites all over again.  It eliminated some of the most fun enemy AI in the series. 
Its powerful as a proof of familial love, that uncle's had his back the whole time, that he's been too wrapped up in a lie to see it.  This whole persona he had designed for himself, and this attitude he'd fallen into, were without any merit.  Its not about whether or not Kylo has an artifact or a fake.  Its about Ben Solo having his own ROTJ "throw the Emperor in the hole" moment.  Watching how this mental cathedral he's built to the dark side be revealed as the dingy little highway-side chapel it is.  He's built up Vader to a fantical point, and not having an artifact and the story being a lie could show that Luke's tales of his father had been right.  That Vader had been the mistake, not Anakin.\n\nLuke's getting Vader to a pyre makes sense, beyond that point however, it doesn't.  You see Qui-Gon getting cremated in TPM, so I suppose we can assume that's some old Jedi practice that Luke might know about.  His sentimentality towards his father stretched to Anakin Skywalker, not the suit that WAS Darth Vader.  Everything about Darth Vader for almost half of Anakin's life had been dominated by this vessel of life support.  He was physically Vader for, what, several hours on Coruscant and Mustafar?  Not even a full day out of the suit.\n\nI'll give you the point that he might keep the ashes.  That could make sense.  That's his father, not Vader.  But the helmet wouldn't serve to remind him of the evils and draw of the dark side any better than the missing hand on his right arm.  What better reminder does Luke need of where carelessness and passion leads?\n\n\nThere needs to be a connection between the Emperor's exploration of the space outside the galaxy and the formation of the First Order under Snoke.  This *could* explain all of that.  Is it perfect?  No.  But neither was having another Death Star and Trench Run in TFA.\n\nIf you look back, I didn't care as much about the helmet being fake originally.  That was mused over later.  I think it would be better to have it be the original helmet.  I'm changing the idea to graft out these supposed holes in it.  Its called collaboration, which I can't do on my own.  I think the body being used is the main fun here.  To some, a fight between Luke and Snoke would be Luke face-to-face with his father's zombified remains!\n\nFinally, your point about the ax is true concerning the top of the head.  But Anakin also had a crazy scar there that makes no sense from what we've seen in the prequel trilogy.  When you look at the CG work and detail on the concepts done in TFA preproduction, Snoke's injuries on the left side of his face and neck are CLEARLY burns.
But no ones considering that old piece of concept art showing a hooded figure with that same robotic hand holding the charred helmet of Vader on board an imperial ship. That might not be Luke at all.  
Fandango is selling, but full of errors!  Accidentally bought 10 tickets instead of 2!
Arms, for sure... or at least hands.  But so did Luke after Vader chopped his off in Cloud City.  Medical technology within the universe has come a long way.\n\nOR, if you wanted the more wacky version, say he realized the decrepitness of his body, and began harvesting pieces from Force strong individuals to Frankenstein's Monster himself together.  That's why he's raising Kylo to be so powerful.  Eventually he will take over that body, and rule the galaxy with a stronger fist.\n\nAgain, the second one is the wackier idea.
Yeah, to me that's enough of an explanation, but I don't know if they WANT to try and explain it like that.  Lucas really wrote that whole thing into a corner in the prequels. Stopped it from just being the afterlife. Stupid move IMO

He's trying to translate what Trump said whilst accusing everyone else of the same thing.\n\nI think there's some good points that he's making, but you can't do the thing you're against while you're trying to clear the air.
I don't think you're taking the time to explain yourself then.  Please go ahead.

You know who told you you need structure and government?  The people running the structure and government.  You don't shoot for sharing everything in a Communist society, people shouldn't be equalized; everyone's needs should be met and then everyone's "find a job you like and you'll never work a day in your life" brings everyone else opulence as everyone feels safe enough to naturally adopt a "my brother's keeper" lifestyle/philosophy.
I still haven't seen proof that its a grave next to him...
I had about $900 with Verizon for only 2 lines and same 2 months of bills and early cancellation, so I can believe it.
A moment of silence please for the movie were getting screwed out of..... . Dammit Marvel get on this!!! 
Could very well be, too early to tell.  I just think it would be in character for Leia to want to attend some huge funeral, freaking all her people out as they're at their weakest and the First Order at its strongest, and them all stumbling into/being responsible for saving everyone from a First Order attack.
Papi got some moves!
Absolutely. We'd get so much more done.
EDIT: Finally got a third viewing in, and while I can agree it totally appears to be an eroded cross, there's no reason to use that symbol as a sort of grave marker within the Star Wars universe.  So while it might be one at the filming location, I can't agree that it was being used for that in the film until 8 or 9 explicitly shows it's a gravestone.\n\n\nORIGINAL:  OK cool!  Have only had the opportunity to see it twice so far, and hadn't got around to scanning for the gravesite yet.  Thanks for the pic!\n\nI wonder how much they meant to use that......
Have Luke show him the actual artifact.  Make it a "the Jedi Master never lied to you" moment.  It would be powerful story-wise.  Have Kylo turn good on Snoke in a final fight at the end of IX, an echo of how Luke turned dark on Vader in VI\n\nThere's no obviousness, however, to Luke keeping the helmet or anything else.  Kylo raiding the pyre, maybe... but that's if the Ewoks and other indigenous species left it alone for all those years.  An Occam's razor explanation wouldn't include Luke dragging a body onto a ship, flying it to the closest celestial body, building a gigantic pyre by hand, dragging body to said pyre unseen by everyone on the ground celebrating, burning pyre and body to ash, and then building a shrine over the body after the celebration party with the rest of the Rebels.\n\nThere's also, now that I've seen the more clear picture in the VFX reel for the Oscars, the hint that where the mask is burnt through the worst (left cheek/jaw area) matches to where Snoke's face is the most messed up.
Adding my name to the shitstorm!
Never have I been so happy to read fan fiction.  Brilliant! 
Fun thing about Communism:  Marx and Lenin thought it would only come about thanks to a Vanguard.  And yet it can NEVER come about with a Vanguard, because you now have the people who want the most in a position to take it and NONE of them have the true brother's keeper mindset at that point that working Communism will rely on.

Huh, I never realized they retconned that!  Originally when Episode 1 came out it was stated that the Neimodians had them built to resemble a shriveled Neimodian corpse.

Communism is not having rules because you live in such a way that rules are irrelevant.  So no structure or government.  And not because its fun to buck the system, but because everyone is taking care of everyone.  Like this: http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/HumanTable.jpg
I used to learn martial arts from that guy as a kid before he started doing his speaking tours
Then why let it get destroyed at the end of his fight with Rey right before she made him a little less beautiful?  The cross guard style might return, but it won't be so unstable. He'll be a much more refined and focused individual after his training.  It would make too much sense to have him create a lightsaber that reflected the change.
One thing didn't make any sense to me.  Vox kept all the medicare costs in when single-payer would eliminate those costs.  That should zero out, or grant savings to, anyone making under $300k; and that savings should transfer over to their employers as well.\n\nMy employer currently offers them covering about $300-350 of my medical costs, and my covering the additional $970-980.  So a total of $3600-4200 a year paid by my employer and $11,640-11,760 a year paid by me.\n\nUnder Bernie's plan, my employer would pay $2,480 and I would pay $880.  I much prefer that, personally.\n\n[These guys built a calculator for it.](http://berniecare.org/)

Bravo!  I was so wrapped up I didn't even see that coming!
Let's give this a half-second of time.  I expect downvotes.  However I am tickled by my thinking here, so consider the following:\n\nSince the prequels haven't yet been taken out of canon, and the "lost" season of Clone Wars establishes the fact that midi-chlorians are basically intelligent bacteria, we can assume that unless a bonfire can kill off every bit of bacteria within a human body that's shielded inside whatever badass suit Vader was supposed to have there was some connection to the Force present within the smoldering pyre on the forest moon of Endor.\n\nNow here's the speculation/fan-theory...  If Palpatine, technically being the most powerful evil being in the galaxy by ROTJ, had already been messing about with something (or somethings) beyond the Outer Rim, who's to say he hadn't been infusing himself with whatever great evil he was coming across?  And what if the evil inside fled as his body was disintegrated within the exploding Death Star v2.0?  Cast adrift in this chaos, it heads towards what begins as a beacon of Force power soaring away from the explosion, but after a short while on the moon's surface, begins to fade.  It takes this supernatural monstrosity several days to find its goal (within which time everyone would have left).\n\nPicture that this evil made its way into the desiccated husk that had once been Anakin Skywalker.  Imagine it repairing the dying and destroyed cellular structure of what remained of his body, and not being able to make a full recovery obviously.  What it could know about human biology would've been inferred from the horribly destroyed body it now possessed and the shriveled nothing the Emperor had wasted away into.  Conjure up within your mind the scene of that husk taking a lurching and awkward "first breath", the sound of which echoes a certain mechanical consistency present in the nightmares of every Rebel Alliance operative aware of the Right Hand of the Emperor.\n\nThink of the montage/flash back this would make as Snoke finally schools Kylo, while the young man bathes his Starkiller injuries away in a tank of bacta, as to why he had Vader's mask to give to him in the first place.  Imagine the moment (VIII echoing hopefully less bits of V than VII did of IV) as Snoke stretches to his full height and declares in the grandest of lies that he IS Kylo's grandfather and now Kylo will begin his true training...  There you have it.  The body of Anakin, possessed by an ENTIRELY NEW CHARACTER.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nJust for giggles sake, I do really hope you're reading this, Rian.  
Really?  Looked and sounded like Unkar Plutt to me...

> Lemme see what I can do about answering all of these:\n> \n> \n> \n> 1, Force Ghost: Yes, we did see his Force Ghost, but his body didn't dissolve away like Obi-Wan or Yoda when he seemingly died (after taking off the mask while still on board the Death Star II. So there is some wiggle room there. Plus, the "technically official" canon now has him returning as 25ish year-old Anakin... so... make of that what you will.\n> \n> \n> \n> 2, Body capable of life: All other Force Ghosts we've seen are people relinquishing their bodies. No one dies and THEN comes back... within canon anyway. So, it may be a phenomenon of how powerful he is. The background thought previously was that he followed the same path, but ROTJ (to my memory) doesn't show him fading. My theory also runs off some prequel stuff. I don't know if the whole midicholorian thing really makes sense to the Original Trilogy.\n> \n> \n> \n> 3, Fire not leaving body: You are absolutely right that the fire should cook the body away. But all we see is a fully sealed and intact suit on the pyre. The thing was designed from the beginning to be armor. Resistant to many things, including fire. The body maybe would've boiled inside at worst, but since the thing was sealed back up I don't see how the fire would've done much damage.\n> \n> \n> \n> AH! But then, we've now seen the helmet in TFA! Clearly it was all melted and destroyed! And the "Pit 'o Ash" in Kylo's room looks like there was remains that the little sicko kept for himself... But if the stories of the suit are true, then who says that's the original helmet? Who says any of that stuff Kylo keeps as treasures are real? Hence that its all a big lie perpetrated by Snoke.

They don't videos of police brutality, physical assaults, animal abuse, porn, gore or anything related to politics. It's meant to be a light-hearted subreddit that is purely for entertainment.
It would be quicker, but agonizing. Freezing would be slow, but you'd just go numb after a while and fall asleep.
Both of those statements are false. 54.1% of voters voted for someone other than Trump in 2016, and candidates with a minority of the vote have only won 7 times in the last 100 years (and most of those were in elections with a major third party candidate).
> Ted Cruz sometimes votes Democrat too that doesn't mean i wouldn't try to replace him with somebody else just because "he is sometimes a democrat" \n\nThen why are you not making threads about him? Why are there so many threads about Manchin and none about Cruz?\n\nCruz's election in 2018 is more important than Manchin's. It's a still long shot, but it's actually conceivable that a Democrat could win it. It's not conceivable that anyone to the left of Manchin will win WV in 2018.

You can figure it out with algebra. The variable *x* represents the price:\n\n    x - (.8 * x) = 83 [The left side of the equation means: The price minus 80 percent of the price]\n\n    .2x = 83 [Combining like terms]\n\n    .2x/.2 = 83/.2 [Dividing both sides of the equation by .2]\n\n    x = 415\n\n
I looked on Google for an picture of H.W. playing a GameBoy, the closest I could find [was this](http://i.imgur.com/DqjqjjU.jpg).
There are many, many more worthwhile targets to go after.\n\nWest Virginia is not going to elect a progressive liberal. If you primary Manchin, you're just giving the seat to the Republicans.
/r/OurPresident\n\nThis will go over well
How is the biker's race relevant?
Be realistic. WV is one of the most conservative parts of the country. If you want change in a state like that, it needs to start at the bottom. State legislators, city councils, school boards. They aren't just going to go straight from voting 68% for Trump in 2016 to voting for a Berniecrat senator in 2018.
Sort by controversial.
For one, you're comparing the current labor cost to what it would be if labor were free. You should be comparing the current cost to what it would be without immigrants.\n\n$30/bin is what growers had to pay when there was a labor shortage (like your article mentions). Even at $30/bin, there were still practically zero American citizens who chose to pick apples. What would the wage have to be for Americans to want to do it?
VirginiA, PennsylvaniA. They're all east coast except Hawaii.\n\nWest coast has more abbreviations with the first two letters, WAshington, ORegon, IDaho, UTah, so I think it's CAlifornia. 
It's not inane, though, it's the easiest way of letting kids drink water while disallowing drinks that are either alcoholic or more likely to cause stains or stickiness when spilled.
Sony and Microsoft both require all games for their newest consoles to be available digitally. So the physical copies are just there for the people who prefer buying those.
Yes, usually indie games and ports are digital only. 
House of Leaves? That's the most obvious answer.\n\nI'd suggest "Ubik" by Philip K. Dick, even though it might not be typical horror (his works are generally classified as science fiction). There are actually several PKD books that I would describe as "surreal horror."\n\n
How narrow is your definition of political subreddits?\n\nIt seems like the top posts on /r/pics every day are always political now, do subs like that count?
To say it's "100% made up by Americans," is a little inaccurate. It's made up by Chinese-Americans.\n\nIt's Chinese food, but adapted to be more appealing to Americans.
Geraldo was the one getting irate.
The ego in "ego death" is not the same ego that people commonly refer to. \n\nWhen people say "your ego disappears" on LSD they mean "your sense of self disappears."
A step sequencer? I'm not sure what you're asking.
No one said anything about Hillary but you, I'm just stating facts.\n\nThere have only been 7 candidates in the last 25 elections who won with less than 50% of the vote, but you claim "presidents are almost always elected by a minority vote."
There was only one guy who did that, though.
It can make a person less susceptible to hypothermia.

They take away immersion.\n\nI prefer to have them on, though.
You have to prove your age and sign for it when it's delivered. They won't ship to P.O. boxes or just leave the package at your house.
Do they have Moon Man?
They make consoles that also have portable features. They're still primarily designed to be played on a television.\n\nThe PlayStation Vita can remotely play any PlayStation 4 game. Does that make the PS4 a mobile console?
This will probably get deleted, but thanks for posting because I was actually looking for this feature a few weeks ago and couldn't find it.
Sanders and Ellison both agree that the Democratic Party can be localized and tailored to different constituents.\n\nWould you prefer a party that is only relevant in coastal, urban areas? Because we already have that.
Maybe he was, but I don't think an LSD trip he had proves anything. Just because he said he was Jesus doesn't mean he was obsessed with himself. You don't know what went through his mind to come to that conclusion, and it's very hard to convey those kinds of thoughts you have while tripping to other people.
Because they're isolated from each other.\n\nQuebec and France do their own dubs, as well. So do Brazil and Portugal. In English, British and North American English are different as well, but we use subtitles more often than dubs.

It doesn't matter. It's just a quick way of looking at how much support a candidate had.
I think the Westminster equivalent of the US Speaker of the House is the Prime Minister. Which is a partisan position.\n\nIn the UK, the Speaker's main role is to preside over the House, but in the US, the Speaker doesn't even do that a lot of the time (they delegate it to other members of the party).
I don't think he wants to, for whatever reason.\n\nI've listened to a ton of VORWs, and people used to write and ask for mp3s of the show all the time, and he never did anything about it.

It's been a while since I've been there, but they have features that Reddit does not, like public logs of deleted comments and banned users. You can see the real number of up/downvotes on any comment or submission. They also limit the amount of upvotes a new user can give, and they don't allow one IP address to vote multiple times on the same post.

To answer the second part of your question, this is how you figure out percentages:\n\nIf you want to find out what 80% of $415 is, you would multiply .8 * 415.\n\nThe answer is 332. \n\n415 – 332 = 83.

I'm just saying there are more worthwhile people to go after.\n\nI could just as easily say I don't trust you either. You're a concern troll and you just want us to waste our attention and resources on impossible tasks which, even if we somehow do succeed at, would still only benefit the Republican Party.\n\nAlabama, Arizona, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. Those are all states where Republican senators are up for re-election in 2018, and they are **all** more likely to flip left than Manchin's seat is. Why not focus on those?
There are many non-English languages, so it would depend on how closely their native language is related to English.
The consensus among intelligence agencies is that Russia was behind hacking into the e-mail accounts of Democratic Party staff members and releasing tens of thousands of their e-mails. The CIA believes their motivation was to prevent Hillary Clinton from winning.\n\nThere's no evidence, however, that Russia hacked into voting machines or changed vote counts in anyway.
The government released the books and digital files found in bin Laden's compound, it's actually pretty intersting.\n\nA lot of English-language books about U.S. foreign policy (including several by Noam Chomsky) and articles on counter-terrorism from RAND and other think tanks.

Pence gets to pick a new VP, but they have to be confirmed by Congress first. If Pence dies/resigns/gets removed from office before his VP is confirmed, then the presidency goes to the next person in the line of succession (the Speaker of the House).
Who knows what's going on in his head, though? He probably genuinely believes that he is the greatest president ever, and people only think otherwise because of fake news and the system being rigged against him.

There are no polls of electoral votes. What are *you* even talking about?\n\nEdit: Check the [HuffPo Pollster](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton).

If we're talking in terms of well-being in a population, the US is ranked 13th out of 50 developed countries or 156 countries in total. Japan is 53rd out of 156. Top is ruled by countries like Denmark, Switzerland, Canada, etc. It's above average in developed countries but not towering.

I'm surprised to see statistics from statcan that follow the UN guidelines for measuring subjective well-being.\n\n Interesting to see that Quebec generally ranks higher. My explanation would be because of public transport and also group initiative being more present which would lower the well-being inequality and increase overall well-being. Toronto on the other hand, people don't try to rally together like they do for Quebec and Ottawa. \n\nWe had representatives coming all the way from Montreal to Ottawa for a Japanese conversation circle. Turns out up there they have significantly more initiatives and awareness groups for promoting Japanese culture than in Ottawa, despite Ottawa having a significantly larger population. That's my experience. 
I started out in calculus a full chapter behind (out of 5). Basically I was sick of trying to balance and just threw a ton of time at the problem. I figured out what marks I needed to just squeeze by, what kind of free marks there are until I can catch up in the course. I figured out if I got at least 25% on every test, they'll drop that mark and take the best 3/4. I took the first test, and with just the knowledge I previously had I was able to get 55%. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I'm up to date with test content. I'm still working 7-10 hours a day to catch up to lecture homework, sometimes the days are 13 hours. I want to use reading week to fill that gap and get ahead.  \n\nBtw I think this is an underrated approach, but not everyone will be in a position where they are able to just throw time at it. If you're putting in more work than is currently required, then you'll be all caught up in no time. Need to figure out how and when you can make the test deadlines intersect with the time when you'll be caught up.

Last year I went and studied at the library from 8-5 every day. I failed. The semester before that I studied only a few hours with my studying spread out across the day and did well. This left me dumbfounded, how could I study more and learn less? \n\nWell the answer to that question requires a bit of knowledge of current neuroscience involving learning, most specifically states of focus. Basically, your mind enters one of two states, focus and diffuse mode. Focus is when you are focused without distraction and diffuse is when you are not focused, aka daydreaming or doing things that are for the most part automatic (like driving). \n\nThe problem is when you spend too long in either state. Your mind needs time in the diffuse mode to process the information you've been focusing on. You need to plan in time of 'relaxing' activities in order to learn more. The book A Mind for Numbers saved my education to be honest, we really have advanced to the point where we have the knowledge of how learning works now. \n\nAn ideal study plan would look like the following:\n\n- Study for 45 minutes without any distractions.\n\n- Walk around for 5-10 minutes\n\n- Study for 45 minutes, no distractions\n\n- Reward activity, watch a video or play a video game \n\nEtc.\n\ntl;dr: Taking breaks is part of the learning process, plan in relaxing breaks.\n\nOh and use flashcard software for remembering stuff. 
There isn't really any National convention for determining whether a country is developed or not developed. I just used a number for the fourth quartile of countries listed on the human development index. \n\nYes this means that there are countries not on the top 25% of the human development index that are above Japan. However Japan is 21st in HDI. \n\nI used numbers from the World Happiness Report, conducted by the UN SDSN.
Went to a really amazing concert a few months back. Amazing in that the artist had an expectation that people would not use their phones, the crowd gave off a whole vibe of enjoy the moment and have fun.\n\n It's actually the process of being a part OF the show, moshing and jumping around with all you've got is just as important as the band performing on stage. Without that, I don't think it would be as great a performance. 
How to break into a social circle if you need to. Begin by introducing yourself and then talking a little. Then kind of distance yourself naturally and come back and make an observation about something and give them an opportunity to expand on it. For example if everyone has just been given a tough assignment, introduce yourself and make small talk. Then focus on the assignment and then bring up a point about it that adds value, like "this question is pretty hard isn't it? You just use X method right?". If they want you to stay around they'll probably say something like "yeah I don't understand X, do you know?" if not they'll probably say something like "yeah it is". \n\nHypothetical situation but if you just keep doing this until you find someone who wants to work on the assignment you'll meet people. Introduction is the hard part, it's easier said than done after all. \n\n[A video by Barron with parallels to meeting people by yourself.](https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=DOu0ZH562Uw)

Interestingly enough, activation of the DMN, the brain network involved in mind wandering, is decreased in long term meditators. [Source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763414000724)\n\nSo decreased activation of the DMN might mean less mind wandering. The complete effects of this are not clear, as mind wandering/the DMN play a key part in processing information. \n\nBtw for those interested in meditation, [check out this non-spiritual guide.](https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-meditate)\n

I think the reason there aren't many weekly plans is because to shop cheap you usually need to buy what's in season and what's on sale, which will vary heavily depending on where you live. From that you can usually choose a few recipes from a book and find the cheapest thing for the week. \n\nTofu is a pretty good meal plan item I think. It is a great long lasting item that's cheap, depending on where you live, and easy to use. To me it's essentially a chicken replacement that you can store in the fridge for 1-2 months and the preparation is just to take a cube out and cut it into pieces. It eliminates the need for freezing/thawing chicken, which is helpful for a someone trying to stick to a meal plan the first time. \n\nI agree with the idea of finding things you like and then making a meal plan from that. Recipes usually list the servings so reason from there, for a single person you'll usually need about 14 servings split between lunch and dinner a week. \n\nFor me, I do big shopping at Walmart once every two weeks for cans/some long lasting vegetables and use their online pickup option. Then to fill in throughout the week, stuff like sweet potatoes from the local market to make an easy meal. Depends on your preferences.\n\nEdit: the cookbook in the sidebar lists prices and servings and so does budgetbytes so start there.

Activation of the DMN, heavily linked to the activity of mind wandering, is shown to decrease in long term meditators. \n\nThough it's not clear what the specifics and effects are. It might mean that spacing out is required less or a plethora of other things.

Find someone who wants to practice their English. Agree to spend 30 talking in Japanese and 30 minutes in English. \n\nThis works out to a pretty good deal in practice. The alternative is making trips to a language exchange, it takes time to travel there and you aren't guaranteed to speak Japanese so you often lose that 30 minutes anyways. 
Yaba!\n\nKi-ni-natchatte doo shiyoo?\n\nI like YAVA because they noticeable say Chigau (違う) a lot, which essentially means to differ. I was learning the kanji while listening to that song and the choreography is killer. \n
You don't need friends to socialize, a meetup group for various interests if you are in a city should work well. Board Games force you to interact with the other people so there's a good idea.
Didn't know about LEOS, I'll check it out later thanks. 
Thought those were non-RHCP tour dates and almost freaked out for a second. 
There's also plenty of interesting English language exchanges on YouTube. Learn about other countries and see how people try to overcome language barriers. Bonus if you're learning a language and it's relevant. 
Write a really killer resumé and apply everywhere. Edit the resumé to fit each place you apply to, no one wants to see a batch résumé.

Once someone starts to display anger it's best to diffuse it or there's a possibility they're gonna make a bad decision and you're going to pay for it.\n\nFor the cyclist, getting run over. For the driver, getting charged. Both lose in this situation. 
I don't feel like it's entirely relevant to discipline and that people might have a little to much time on their hands on both sides. Watching too much pornography is a time sink and indicative of a bored life. Beating yourself up for watching it a little isn't helpful either. \n\nI think it's helpful to question the habit, as is the same for any habit you currently have. How much time per week am I spending on this habit? What benefits do I get? Ect.

A poorly sourced opinion piece for sure, but what does language have to do with it? Do I need to know German to try to understand why there's a rise in massacres in Germany?
Engineering often tends to be the limiting factor in terms of data collection. Theory can advance when the engineering efforts collect more data and allows the limiting factor to be moved further forward for the theoretical side. \n\nRemoving the absence of data is the real breakthrough. 
If it's a busy day with classes, I'll do 4-8. But on weekends usually 8-12. \n\nAlways aim to be better than yourself. 
There are far too many benefits to forgo studying throughout the day. Treating school like a job can be counteractive to the learning process. \n\nLearning takes time and requires  breaks throughout the day in order for information to be encoded effectively. Setting a work schedule interrupts this process because you are increasing the amount of focused time and decreasing the length of breaks. Thus you can invest more time into study and learn less. \n\nI advocate for integrated study. Living your life in between the study sessions. You can study hard concepts and then have a break as you would normally and then come back to the content and find you have a new understanding. This is how the DMN can be used effectively, also it's helpful to study before bed because sleep is the ultimate DMN, you can sleep and wake up with new insights.
I was interested in starting a Toronto meetup, but I'll be leaving very soon so it never left idea stage. Meetups everywhere is certainly a good idea.
This book helped a lot when I applied the techniques and some other parts of my life fell into place at the right time. I recommend pairing it with being out of school and working 40 hours a week while studying something that interests you. It's a great learning experience and gives you that extra edge needed to push through work and school. Seeing why you need to push through school and what the alternative is, is a humbling experience. \n\nActually I'll go into detail. I did garbage for two stores for a while and every day I was disgusted with my work when I started, then I began to accept everything. My boss pushed us to do 56 hour work weeks sometimes and then a week off. I started to learn to cook out of the work and formally study from a textbook by myself using the techniques in that book. I started to study at work with my free time, my boss understood that if I did my job efficiently and performed by duties then I could be left to my own devices. Work came first but after studying and working so much it changed my perspective. Back in school is very difficult but I'm constantly motivated to keep putting in the effort to form habits, to push past that self doubt using the techniques in that book. 
I put important points down in Anki, sometimes during the class when the professor goes slower, after the class if the content is quicker. I'll SRS math/logic laws, rules and definitions, anything the professor puts emphasis on remembering. \n\nWorks well for me because I review on the 30 min bus ride instead of sitting and waiting.

About how other users on Reddit make blanket statements about everything. I was reading a post where someone said this and realized, that's exactly what I was doing myself by thinking this. 
Bought spices for a year for $10
I believed this until I did a little bit of research. Garlic can pick up botulism causing bacteria, but the toxins are only created when stored in oxygen-free conditions at room temperature. Examples of this would be combining it with oil and storing at room temperature. \n\nSecondary source: [You can web archive the reference if you want](http://www.livestrong.com/article/485148-eating-raw-garlic-botulism/)
Worked maintenance only for two stores for 6 months. I find the amount of litter on the ground is roughly the same as before they removed them. \n\nThe key is to keep the amount of litter low in the first place and to keep garbage cans hidden from view. Seeing garbage reminds people of their garbage and thus sometimes they feel entitled to throw it on the ground. It took about 2-3 weeks for people to adjust.
I can't believe they just give those away at shows! \n\n[Moa and Yui certainly keep a towel around.](https://secure.static.tumblr.com/a02b9bfd419dc2785dc22ce83e248ce3/u5hjfkp/fL7np40om/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_3hqxn864zm68kkgsg48cs88cs_640.gif) 
It's not shocking because the average age in Vancouver is 39 and roughly 50% of Vancouver's population is of SE and East Asian origin.
I only really sing out phrases for comedic effect or when I'm feeling it. For example my dad is singing Feliz Navidad and I join him for a bit adding a bit of emphasis on the fact he's singing "Feliz Navidat" instead. Followed by me and my brother joking "classic feliz naviDAD". That being said when I'm doing this I'm doing it because I'm feeling free and just want to have fun, that's all. 
I just buy whatever I can price match. $5 pizzas for $2-3, hell yeah. 
Reminds me of a documentary about a 4th grade teacher in Japan who was really good. There was an event coming up for the kids and they built a boat together to float around in the pool. A kid got in trouble and then someone stood up for him saying just because he got in trouble he shouldn't have to miss out on the boat. \n\nThe teacher took this in an interesting way, he played the devil's advocate to push the students to team up together against him and elocate their argument for why he should be allowed to join. Very interesting documentary, these kids do some things more logically than an adult would. It's called Children Full of Life. 
There are a lot of threads about multiculturalism, Canada and other countries. I agree that Canada is doing very well in the face of multiculturalism. I read a recent Reddit comment and the gist of it was that Nordic countries are very well off because they don't accept as many refugees and are less multicultural, but I'll challenge that view.\n\nCanada is ranked #6 on the world happiness report, behind Nordic countries, yet we receive a significantly larger amount of refugees than other countries. It's invalid to think that it's not possible to accept multiculturalism without degrading society or losing values. What's more, if people remain happy and the economy is doing alright, why does it matter where the culture goes. \n\nIn that same vein, the people of the US need to start evaluating themselves and stop placing the blame somewhere else. The US is ranked 14th on the same scale and is rapidly losing its place. \n
Didn't Christmas heavily borrow from Saturnalia? It's main observances being feasting, role reversals, gift-giving, gambling...\n\nEdit: It did\n\n>The popularity of Saturnalia continued into the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, and as the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, many of its customs were recast into or at least influenced the seasonal celebrations surrounding Christmas and the New Year. \n\nSource: Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 85 (1981), p. 289.
My phone has NFC so I got a tag and set up an NFC alarm, there's an Android app. Basically to turn off the alarm I need to press dismiss and tap my phone to the NFC tag. The same NFC tag, set by the door of my room, sets the alarm volume, turns off the wifi and opens the alarm app when I choose to go to bed. They only cost around $1 a tag locally, or way less if you accept shipping from China and a long wait. \n\nOnce I'm by the door, I automatically get my day started.

I was going out with a girl, she leaves for Japan and tells me halfway through she's been seeing another guy. She assumed I knew because we were casual. Haven't seen her since but I hate the feeling of not being worth her time. 
Will you read my reply to the other comment?
Heat it up and then keep pressing until the behavior stops. Aka press until it stops giving the shut off menu and doesn't turn the screen back on when you put it into sleep. This is very tricky once the phone turns off because having it on is the only way you can verify its working quickly. \n\nHeating up melts the glue or whatever is stuck in the button mechanism until it can be pushed backed into an operational state. \n\nI'm pushing everyday use of this phone and it acts up like once a week to once a month and takes 5 minutes to fix. 
If you use tofu you can avoid the hassle of buying/defrosting chicken and store tofu in bulk in your fridgerator, further adding to the ease.

I used to do that and it worked but I found for studying it's more effective to add a break in the middle and have a study session before bed.  Thus you get the benefits of both breaks. Breaks are effective  because you are unconsciously solving and sorting the information, which will benefit you for the next study session. If you're stuck on a problem, focusing on it really hard before bed is one of the best things you can do. \n\nI suppose this applies more for people in more theoretical courses. 
How does this compare with psychedelics? Should you be able to see the sights that they allow you to see? Or is it because of the feeling good aspect of meth that makes it much worse?\n\nEdit: My best guess.\n\nMeth is a stimulant acting on the CNS and a psychedelic like LSD acts on seratonin receptors. I guess with general psychedelics you're still experiencing feelings that are relatively normal.

What are you interested in? Try making a club about it and seeing if anyone shows up. Any other towns within reasonable distance? My town has 40k but I still think a programming club would thrive. \n\nHere's the process.\n\nCreate the meetup group. You need to see if people are going to join, I'm sure there are people in a town of 60000 looking for other people, even just one. \n\nAt this point start looking for places to host the club. Public libraries are a good start, cafes are another good option, call around. 
I take caffeine as rotated once or twice a week. It's free caffeine because my roommates gave me a big thing of preground and easily lasts me over a year at that rate. \n\nI've experienced coffee addiction first hand working at a coffee shop, people will wait 10-15 minutes in a drivethrough, daily, to spend a few dollars to get a coffee. It's their routine, I guess. People need to just be more mindful of their habits. 
Yeah from KAgaMI and posted on the portfolio, then upscaled using neural network image processing. 
I tried that out and used to think that, but I think this is bad advice for some struggling students. If you're new to STEM you need a lot of time and effort to start out and keep up. It's almost a must to study throughout the day and before you sleep to grasp those complex concepts while learning how to do the work effectively. Even then you can expect to require a smaller workload until you adjust.

UPS driver here. While a driver could switch your package, it would be easy to make stuff disappear. A driver isn't going to risk his 100-140k job with amazing benefits and retirement plan for whatever in your package. I promise. Now, what happens quite often is a label is left partially placed on or not securely. It rubs against another box and the label is moved. Pretty obvious most of the time but once in a million it could get smashed flat and delivered to the wrong place. Is that what happened? Idk. But I promise the driver didn't steal it.\n
They do, told us to come in at a certain hour but me and my helper felt like we are the ones responsible for Xmas. At least for the people with stuff in our truck so we ran and got it done. Every little bit helps keep them happy

Marriage is seen differently by people with all kinds of experience with it. Maybe he knows that he can live her and want to be with her without having to throw tens of thousands away. Why should he have to prove a commitment like that? It's not ok to say if you loved me you'd marry me when the relationship started with an understanding they wouldn't marry so don't give her that idea.
That video description mentioned there was a bias towards wars in Europe because the English Wikipedia was used. It also mentioned major battles. Just because war/battle wasn't mentioned in that video doesn't mean everyone else was chilling. Read a bit more, there were wars and battles going on everywhere almost constantly.

He's considering it, he has changed his mind from what they had discussed in the beginning. It's perfectly fine for him to not see the necessity of marriage and she has every right to try to convince him. Not everyone has to follow the same life plans as everyone else.

Obligatory how many images are you sent?
You are 19, thus isn't a big deal. Relax take a deep breathe of fresh air, ha, and go have a sit down talk. The biggest issue you can have is coming of condescending or talking down to her. If you can't figure out an adult way to tell her as equals that issue you won't make it. Communication is bigger than a smelly pussy and if something like this you won't make it.
Late night study session at the community college ended with me and a fried chasing down a lady with a flat tire. We ran her car down on for because she obviously didn't know it was flat. She stayed crying so we backed away after realizing why and shouted to her why we chased her car. We left asap because we felt really dumb and didn't want to scare her anymore.

We are not in communication, I'm not going to bash her but she would unload her daily issues on me and blame me for it. I told her that I'm down to help her but this making me the monster wasn't ok. She blocked me on everything.

I've done this...twice, with the same girl....fucking hurts and yeah she thought she had her period. It hurt bad enough I kept assuring her it was definitely me.
She does have her father, she sends half the time with him but still tells her friends at school I'm her dad too. I just ran into her preschool teacher at Walmart. She tells people I'm on vacation, which is what she was told when her grandpa wen to jail for a dui. So I guess that's what her mom is telling her now.
But doesn't that require a smartphone? A pretty big thing in my center that the union backs is UPS doesn't pay for my phone ergo they cannot use it for work. They don't ever call me or text unless I initiate it. I can't see them requiring an app or smartphone.
The word that describes that feeling is sonder, one of my favorite
Why do you say that?
It's not bad and I think you'd have a better time selling your current card now to offset the process rather than when people are looking to buy their own 970 on black friday

UPS delivery guy, deliver to some nice houses. One day a customer freaked because her name wasn't on the package, her bosses was.

No one was hurt in the KKK parade, he didn't endorse or applaud it. Nothing was destroyed. Gtfo with that crap. KKK is garbage but they're harmless. They aren't rioting.
OK shitforbrains you're right to an extent. We make life easier for ourselves by taking advantage of others. Other species and other people. There has never EVER been progress without someone else losing. Nature isn't a hippies dream and it never will be. You would never get to space if everything was roses and everyone was happy with what they had. They would just keep hunting and gathering for eternity and space does have tons of shit. And it's far apart and it would take energy and effort to get to it so a species dedicated to that would have to feel entitled to it and have an expansionist mindset.
I like them. I drive for a living and going from California and Arizona to Utah is awesome
Yeah gfy
They're vile and abhorrent but they don't riot or do any actual harm.
Suggest a dual shower, wash each other's bodies and eat her out when she's clean. It's totally different. You need to show your subconscious that it's not a matter of it being disgusting but humans sweat and naturally it isn't pleasant but eating her out can be.
What harm have they caused? Said some mean words? Nobody died because of them No one lost their business or were harmed in their parade. They have a fucked up history, they are worthless as a group but right here right now they are better for society. Their contributions are more than the rioters. At least people can ignore them, woo-hoo they had a fucking parade that they likely paid the government to be able to have. They put money into their schools. Everyone can ignore them and nothing will happen. I don't see videos of them jumping people for voting for Clinton but I've seen far too many people getting jumped for being white, for voting Trump for just not being the kind of people liberals want them to be. You guys can suck my dick because until your actions show you want something better, that you're willing to work and contribute to society to help the world be a better place. The trumps will win.
Obviously it's a false world and all that. It is JK Rowlings world though and her writing. Sure you're entitled to change what you want to accept in your own mind but just realize it's not what anyone else sees. You don't have a right to tear that down for anyone else. No one will be able to share that with you because we all have her books. You can make your own conclusions and all that but it's wrong to force that on other people. Have fun though that's what it's all about.\n

That might be even more ironic than the fact that they are opposed to multiculturalism "because Europe" while meanwhile Europe is the most culturally blended continent, it is literally multiculturalism incarnate.. one big experiment in genetic and ethnic mixing. Hell ~[20%](http://www.livescience.com/42933-humans-carry-20-percent-neanderthal-genes.html) of the Neanderthal genome is preserved in the genomes of Europeans. [Most European people have 1-2% Neanderthal DNA.](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/neanderthal/) with some up to 4% that's how multicultural Europe is. Nevertheless these white nationalists are still shook by what they call "multicults" and the menace of cultural blending .. \n\nThis is [triple facepalm](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/698/489/2f7.png) weather.
Yes and they often do the testing in Africa ... whicih is wrong for many reasons.
This would print out so nice and it would scale well. It would make a nice wall, especiallly with LEDs in the fireflies.\n\nMake the LEDs different sizes with a semi opaque plastic lens, and then make them flicker a bit.\n\nNot that it isn't nice as it is this is just what I see for one great potential in terms of production when I look at it.
What is that an example of? What am I looking at, here, even?\n\nYes, words can be taken out of context. It's nothing new.
http://grist.org/politics/why-is-trump-so-fixated-on-abolishing-the-epa/\n\nHe said he would abolish the EPA a lot.\n\n>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has been notably light on policy specifics. Yet one of his very few clear proposals is to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. He has called for doing so repeatedly, although he sometimes calls it the “Department of Environmental” or “DEP.” And he’s not the only Republican presidential contender to call for puting EPA on the chopping block. Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich also called for eliminating the agency, and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio called for drastically limiting its authority.\n\nThe EPA needs to be a lot better than it is. They weren't even testing groundwater near fracking sites for contamination until some months ago... but it is an important institution and it absolutely needs public support especially now, with Trump, more than ever. Imagine we just give the DEA budget to the EPA instead? Two birds, one stone, I like that.

This is a really great comment....\n\nI want to give a delta for it but it doesn't actually CMV because my view is a generalization and the examples you offer are possibly only exceptions. But they are significant exceptions..\n\nI sometimes browse PLOS, and it seems full of incredibly innovative, novel, pioneering work. Never "oh we checked this study from 1973 and it was correct." Or even "incorrect." It's almost also never "we checked for _______ and found that it was not true.".. but admittedly PLOS is only journal I have browsed much.\n\nIs there some free journal you can show as an example of your view concerning the differences between academic scientific publications and popsci media ? That potentially could be a delta right there really.

 **Rofecoxib (Vioxx)**\n\nMaker: Merck\n\nRecalled: 2004 (after five years on the market)\n\nFinancial damage: nearly $6 billion in litigation-related expenses alone\n\n***Vioxx is considered to be the largest drug recall in history, and one which elicited one of the greatest public outcries.  Vioxx, prescribed to more than 20 million people as a pain reliever for arthritis, was found to be responsible for increased risk of heart attack and stroke.  Both Merck and the FDA were roundly criticized for ignoring  evidence of the dangers of Vioxx before its eventual recall. The Lancet reported that as many as 140,000 people could have suffered from serious coronary heart disease from taking the drug in the US alone. Merck settled Vioxx litigation in the US for $4.8 billion, with close to $1 billion in legal expenses.***\n\n\n\nCerivastatin (Baycol)\n\nMaker: Bayer\n\nRecalled: 2001 (after four years on the market)\n\nFinancial damage: Litigation-related damages totaled $1.2 billion\n\nBaycol, prescribed to patients as a treatment for high cholesterol, is reportedly responsible for more than 100,000 deaths and about as many lawsuits.  It was connected to a severe muscle disorder known as rhabdomyolysis, which clogs the kidneys with protein from dying muscle tissue.\n\n\nEtc etc etc... if you needed an example of this maybe you should research a little more.\n\n\n(& If you're going to be rude please just don't bother .)

Male circumcision is a genital mutilation practice which is rapidly waning in popularity in the west.\n\nIt's purpose is to desensitize the head of the penis.\n\nIt is the removal of the skin which surrounds the head of the penis.\n\nThis practice is still very common among religious Jews worldwide.\n\n

I mean I have nothing against someone having their decisions heavily informed by their conscience, or empathy, and those are emotional. \n\nthe problem here is the cowardice.\n\nFrank Herbert wrote:\n\n"I must not fear.\n\nFear is the mind-killer.\n\nFear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.\n\nI will face my fear.\n\nI will permit it to pass over me and through me.\n\nAnd when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.\n\nWhere the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."\n\nSo it isn't that their ideas are influenced by their emotions , that doesn't bother me I think that would be reasonable. Everyone's ideas are influenced by their emotions.\n\nThe problem is just they are fearful and ignorant cowards.\n\nI mean look at MLK. Emotional guy right, but his opinions were rock solid also. The emotions aren't the problem.
She said "when they want to interrupt" quite clearly.\n\nNobody should interrupt anyone else it's rude.\n\nI'm not seeing a problem with this and she absolutely is not implying that white peoples shouldn't talk in fact it's the opposite she's trying to create a dialogue that will include white people. A dialogue that will be crucial to national unity and ending racism and racial injustice. That's good for everyone.\n\nThis is just some silly misrepresentation. Her message really is inoffensive and humble.\n\nThanks for the link.
I'm not crapping on anyone holy. Wow. Why leap to such drastic conclusions???\n\nLet me be more clear:\n\nThis subreddit could use low effort posts to create some inertia.

Yes the 4% number is probably low that's based on a bit older and more "established" information.\n\nI have read as high as 8%, and I think 6% is also a common number that is floating around.\n\nAs the genome is understood more fully we are able to recognize more parts of it as Neanderthal.\n\nSo that number probably will keep rising for some years still.\n\nAlso the 20% number I cited is sometimes estimated as high as 40%.

The question asked for common, not correct or best.\n\n>The idea that capitalism is about freedom and socialism is about equality is mistaken.\n\nSo that's great and true, but that idea is also an extremely common misconception.\n\nAgain, op asked for _common._\n\nWhat I have given is a correct answer for the question given.
That is nothing more than a weak excuse they use to justify their fantasies of ethnic cleansing.\n\nTheir underlying motivation for these nonsense claims is not cryptic.\n\nYou'll notice they are never "Scandinavian nationalists" or "Baltic nationalists" they are always "white nationalists." —They have no problem with ethnic mixing, actually, since they never question whether European ethnicities ought to mix.\n\nTldr They just want Europe to be back the way it was before colonialism ended, before there were so many brown people. then they would like it fully again. \n\nWhite nationalists claim their problem is with multiculturalism, but that is an obvious lie. they just hate anyone who isn't white.\n\n
What, conservatives taking words out of context so they can get their daily persecution outrage fix? You're right that is a very common pattern.\n\nWhy should anyone interrupt anyone? it's rude.

Reports of Trump’s diet-drug abuse first surfaced in 1992, when an investigative report in Spy Magazine alleged that Trump, at that time, was a regular user of the drug Tenuate Dospan, whose side effects include “confusions” and “hallucinations.”\n\nA 1993 biography of Trump, Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump by Harry Hurt III, also alleged that Trump’s use of the drug accounted for the real estate mogul’s “mood swings.”\n\nBut according to last week’s Gawker report, Trump — more than two decades later — is on to a different drug.\n\n“According to our source, the Donald Trump of today is on a diet drug called phentermine—and has been since at least April of 2014,” Gawker reported.\n\n“While the U.S. National Library of Medicine notes that most people take phentermine for a month or so at a time, since the drug is addictive, Trump has supposedly been taking it continuously for over two years.”\n\nhttp://www.inquisitr.com/3282568/is-donald-trump-on-drugs-cheap-speed-in-new-report/\n\nWhat would you accept as proof?

Ah.\n\nYeah this already happened when he nuked the TPP.\n\nThose trade agreements hurt the working class more than anyone, and PoC are often some of the working class people who are most vulnerable to the negative economic impacts of multinational corporatism, which is all the TPP really was, at it's core.\n\nIt will happen more clearly.\n\nI try to tell people "we can't just oppose everything he does just because we think he's a piece of shit. We have to try to encourage him to be better, like with positive reinforcement, when he gets something right.\n\n we should reserve criticism and opposition for the policies he is enacting that you would even disagree with if it were Hillary as President doing it. and god knows there will be a lot of that! Probably new legitimate concerns every week maybe every day! But this just non-stop deluge of Trump hate is going to end up with Dems just not being taken seriously."\n\nThat was a big problem with Hillary in the first place, all the fake baiting and pandering, all that fake outrage, all just empty lies.\n\nTrump tries to cut f-35 costs: it's because he's stupid. He cans the TPP: it's because he's a xenophobe. \n\nHe goes to Japan to chat with Abe, everyone says "he's listening and shaking hands wrong!" And I thought it was petty when the right was calling Obama "Obowma" and I mean it was, but at least there was some pattern that the idea was roughly based on even if it was childish bullshit.\n\n\nTldr If they'll only hate him no matter what he does he is going to learn very quickly to not give a fuck what liberals think or say, and that does seem to be the emerging pattern here, which, for me as a progressive, is a big problem.\n\n
No I'm saying I have a working hypothesis which is based on incomplete information, and that I acknowledge that.
The most common objection to socialism, I think, is that it imposes on ones personal rights and freedoms. Rights to be a capitalist, to own means of production as an individual, to become rich.\n\nA common response is that this freedom they lose is not as important as the freedom for everyone to basic human rights such as clean water and Internet etc.\n\nAnother common response would be that rights are imaginary and freedom is not as important as economic equality.
[The Food and Drug Administration’s lethargic regulation of dietary supplements containing a dangerous stimulant described in recent reports in The Times is a classic example of what happens when industry representatives infiltrate the agency that is supposed to regulate them.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/opinion/conflicts-of-interest-at-the-fda.html)\n\n-NYT Editorial Board\n\nThere are a lot of examples of regulatory capture in the FDA.\n\nIn fact they may be taking so long to approve drugs in order to protect marketability of previous patents...\n\nSo your idea that the "FDA is not under regulatory capture" is just totally wrong and what you've offered as evidence of their freedom from RC is not actually evidence of that at all.\n\nSo far as this distinction you're making between academic and commercial science, you will have to be more clear exactly whrrr this line is drawn, and then show me a highly regarded academic journal which publishes a high ratio of studies which confirm the null hypothesis versus those which do not, to support that claim. Should be easy right?\n\nPS no, "The Journal of Null Hypothesis" doesn't count as "highly regarded."\n

It's funny. The real problem is the violence against Trump supporters, is it not?

Look at you, Mr. Professional Jimmy Rustler!  I don't think I can adequately put into words how thrilled I am that the Left has come full circle and is openly endorsing and defending misogyny.  It's unreal how Trump has turned everything on its head in the last 24 months.  Just look at yourselves. You all think it's a good idea to get down in the shit and wrestle with the pigs, even as they beat you with experience. You've even adopted the 'LOL, I triggered u!' meme.  Absolutely amazing.  I love reading through this subreddit.  Makes me feel extremely confident for 2018 and 2020.\n\n#I FUCKING LOVE THIS TIMELINE.
Help me out here.  I need you to point out which part of your comment justifies attacking Conway on her appearance. \n\nIt's not okay when President Donald Trump attacks women based on their appearance.  Why do you and everybody else who upvoted /u/Extra_Moist think it's okay when you attack a woman's appearance?\n\n**EDIT:** This is why you lost 2016.  This is why you'll lose bigly in 2018.  This is why Trump will serve two terms.  Y'all on the left need to get your shit together.
Whatever you need to tell yourself to justify being a misogynist who attacks women based on their appearance.  The mental gymastics you hypocrites go through must be exhausting.  You're disgusting and un-American.\n\nHe's serving two terms.  Not because he's competent, or a great President.  So far he's demonstrated neither.  But the left are stone-cold stupid enough to fuck up what should be an easy election win in 2020.  Just like they did three months ago.  Just like they'll do in 2018.\n\nI'll leave you to continue your War on Women.
What does attacking Conway for her appearance have to do with Trump?  This is about speaking out against misogynists like /u/Extra_Moist.\n\nWe see your hypocrisy. It's *right here* in this very thread for everybody to see.  You can't hide who and what you are.  You (rightfully) call out Trump when he says misogynistic things, but don't bat en eye when your side says misogynistic things.\n\nIt's no wonder why we don't take you seriously.

There are reports out there that Duterte is hooked on Fentanyl.   I know whenever I took opiates, I *always* immediately felt like everything was going to be okay.  It felt like the most optimum series of events would unfold, and nothing could stop it.  That was me on OxyContin.  The opiate effects of Fentanyl are supposed to be 20 times as strong as OxyContin.\n\nFor all we know, Duterte is in his own drugged-up fantasy world where all he needs to keep doing is keep taking Fentanyl, and having people killed.  Then *everything* is just going to work out, somehow.

It's more or less uninhabitable for any reasonably large population in its current state of infrastructure and climate. That doesn't mean people can't live there. You say plenty of people live and work there, but that's not really true. From the perspective of some other countries, you couldn't even describe our total population as having plenty of people, let alone the miniscule communities in the NT. \n\nAlso valuable and inhabitable are not mutually exclusive. 
For people who take the language seriously, yes. However, a huge number of non-native speakers get to the point of being understandable, and then stop there. It really just depends on why and how they're learning English.
You can't say it was rape, but you can, and in fact we do, explain a large number of indigenous Australians being white as a consequence  of rape or forced integration. At the same time though, your comment is an important one. You can't just go around saying one of their parents or ancestors raped the other because at an individual level you can't tell, and it's also just rude and offensive. 
I've never been in a subway that hasn't wrapped my order. The fuck kind of subway are you running exactly?
No, in the corporate world, you are not sued for paying taxes, or choosing to manufacture in the US. The fact that you believe that really does illustrate how you're not mentally fit enough to be involved in this conversation.

Strong language as a response to the absolute asinine view that everything will be just fine. Also just so we're clear, because I don't think you understood, those things will come about as a result of climate change. I wasn't saying they're happening right now... Jesus christ. Moving on, let's talk about facts because clearly you need to actually learn about the where the world is going to go if we don't work on climate change. \n\n\n[Water stress, and agricultural stress](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1281-2)\n\n\n>The overall global-scale consequences of climate change are dependent on the distribution of impacts across regions, and there are multiple dimensions to these impacts. This paper presents a global assessment of the potential impacts of climate change across several sectors, using a harmonised set of impacts models forced by the same climate and socio-economic scenarios. Indicators of impact cover the water resources, river and coastal flooding, agriculture, natural environment and built environment sectors. Impacts are assessed under four SRES socio-economic and emissions scenarios, and the effects of uncertainty in the projected pattern of climate change are incorporated by constructing climate scenarios from 21 global climate models. There is considerable uncertainty in projected regional impacts across the climate model scenarios, and coherent assessments of impacts across sectors and regions therefore must be based on each model pattern separately; using ensemble means, for example, reduces variability between sectors and indicators. An example narrative assessment is presented in the paper. Under this narrative approximately 1 billion people would be exposed to increased water resources stress, around 450 million people exposed to increased river flooding, and 1.3 million extra people would be flooded in coastal floods each year. Crop productivity would fall in most regions, and residential energy demands would be reduced in most regions because reduced heating demands would offset higher cooling demands. Most of the global impacts on water stress and flooding would be in Asia, but the proportional impacts in the Middle East North Africa region would be larger. By 2050 there are emerging differences in impact between different emissions and socio-economic scenarios even though the changes in temperature and sea level are similar, and these differences are greater in 2080. However, for all the indicators, the range in projected impacts between different climate models is considerably greater than the range between emissions and socio-economic scenarios.\n\n\n[Increase in conflict and violence, with special discussion on the impacts of children](http://www.jstor.org/stable/43755230?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\n\n>We have good reason to predict that a warming climate will produce more conflict and violence. A growing contingent of researchers has been examining the relationship in recent years, and theyVe found that hotter temperatures and reduced rainfall are linked to increases in conflict at all scales, from interpersonal violence to war. Children are especially vulnerable to conflict, Richard Akresh writes. In addition to directly exposing children to violence and trauma, conflict can tear families apart, displace whole populations, interrupt schooling, cut off access to health care or food, and eliminate the jobs that families depend on for a living. Children caught in a war zone may suffer physical injuries, malnutrition, developmental delays, and psychological damage, with effects on their physical health, mental health, and education that can persist into adulthood and constrict their ability to make a living. Moreover, those effects can spill over to the next generation and beyond, damaging the affected countries' ability to develop human capital. The likelihood that rates of conflict will increase on a hotter planet, then, poses a serious threat to children's wellbeing—especially in poorer countries, which already see the most wars and other conflicts. Unfortunately, Akresh writes, we still poorly understand the mechanisms that link climate to conflict, and we have almost no evidence to tell us which types of policies could best mitigate the effects of climate change-related violence on children.\n\n[Climate change will require massive structural changes to supply chains, hopefully creative destruction occurs with job movement rather than loss, but no guarantees](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3763/cpol.2008.0513)\n\n>The employment effect of climate policy has emerged as an important concern of policy makers, not least in the USA. Yet the impact of climate policy on jobs is complex. In the short term, jobs will shift from high-carbon activities to low-carbon activities. The net effect could be job creation, as low-carbon technologies tend to be more labour-intensive, at least in the short term until efficiency gains bring down costs. In the medium term, the effect will be felt economy-wide as value chains and production patterns adjust. This effect is more difficult to gauge, particularly if climate policy is unilateral and trade effects have to be taken into account. However, the biggest effect is expected to be long term, when climate policy will trigger widespread structural adjustment. Such episodes of ‘creative destruction’ are often associated with innovation, job creation and growth.\n\n\nContinued below \n

Yes actually I did, you *pay your taxes*. If that means your product costs more, then it costs more.\n\nMore importantly, my comment wasn't about manufacturing in China, it was about whether Trump chooses to exploit loopholes to avoid taxes. You may have it in your mind that Trump is just saving some money on products, but your question doesn't capture the nature of Trump's tax evasion, because his tax evasion is almost certainly not linked to physical products due to the nature of his industry. \n\nI know the world is nice and simple when you conceptualise tax evasion as making a product as cheaper, but that doesn't reflect reality. When you're dealing with real estate, and finance related tax evasion,  there are almost certainly no benefits to the consumer, and it is purely about not paying taxes/making money. 
I didn't think that's what the conversation was about, but I can see your point of view and agree. 
Centerlink require gross income. So you should be reporting $100, because the $10 dollar they give for the employer was never actually your money, and the $1 for insurance is your own expense. Likewise, the $80 is also your own expense. \n\nIf you're really struggling to figure it out go in and see them. \n

Okay, almost entirely uninhabitable and extremely inhospitable for even small communities. There are only 200k people in the entire state, that's barely above Australian regional city sizes, let alone international size standards. \n\n\n
[Food security](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6145/508) \n\n>Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.\n\n[Food security at risk if we fail to adapt, and not all systems are equally adaptable](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/360/1463/2139.short)\n>Dynamic interactions between and within the biogeophysical and human environments lead to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food, resulting in food systems that underpin food security. Food systems encompass food availability (production, distribution and exchange), food access (affordability, allocation and preference) and food utilization (nutritional and societal values and safety), so that food security is, therefore, diminished when food systems are stressed. Such stresses may be induced by a range of factors in addition to climate change and/or other agents of environmental change (e.g. conflict, HIV/AIDS) and may be particularly severe when these factors act in combination. Urbanization and globalization are causing rapid changes to food systems.\n\n>Climate change may affect food systems in several ways ranging from direct effects on crop production (e.g. changes in rainfall leading to drought or flooding, or warmer or cooler temperatures leading to changes in the length of growing season), to changes in markets, food prices and supply chain infrastructure. The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions. For example, in southern Africa, climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying, ongoing issue and as a short-lived shock. The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate long-term stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate. In other regions, though, such as parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, other drivers, such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation, rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security.\n\n>Because of the multiple socio-economic and bio-physical factors affecting food systems and hence food security, the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform. Improved systems of food production, food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change, but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability. Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change.\n\nContinued below. 
For about 60 years in the early 20th century, indigenous children were forcefully taken from their homes in order to integrate them with Western society. As a consequence many indigenous people have an Anglo name, and the children of the taken children tend to be white because their parents mixed after forced integration or in many cases were half-caste to begin with. This is referred to as the stolen generation and explains why many indigenous Australians are Anglo in appearance and have Anglo names. 
Vaccines have never actually been about the individual, but about the community. The great power of vaccines isn't that they keep people from individually getting sick, but that they halt the spread of disease within a community thanks to heard immunity. \n\nWhen the vaccine coverage is below the heard immunity threshold, even the vaccinated individuals are at risk because it means the disease might be able to develop a foothold in the community. Vaccines are never 100% efficacious, and so when a disease is allowed to subsist and begin to mutate within in the unvaccinated subpopulations, you might start to see vaccine escape phenotypes emerge. \n\nAnd so you might think it's just a problem for the person that can't be vaccinated, but you're really shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nEdit: please excuse over use of the word community, am typing on the go.

I've copy and pasted the entire discussion since you will need access rights to view it and I highly doubt you have them. \n\n>Climate Change Refugees\nJeffrey D. Sachs\n\n>Abstract\nAs global warming tightens the availability of water, prepare for a torrent of forced migrations\n\n>Human-induced climate and hydrological change is likely to make many parts of the world uninhabitable, or at least uneconomic. Over the course of a few decades, if not sooner, hundreds of millions of people may be compelled to relocate because of environmental pressures.\n\n>Hundreds of millions of people may be compelled to relocate\n\n>To a significant extent, water will be the most important determinant of these population movements. Dramatic alterations in the relation between water and society will be widespread, as emphasized in the new report from Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These shifts may include rising sea levels, stronger tropical cyclones, the loss of soil moisture under higher temperatures, more intense precipitation and flooding, more frequent droughts, the melting of glaciers and the changing seasonality of snowmelt.\n\n>Impacts will vary widely across the world. It will be important to keep our eye on at least four zones: low-lying coastal settlements, farm regions dependent on rivers fed by snowmelt and glacier melt, subhumid and arid regions, and humid areas in Southeast Asia vulnerable to changes in monsoon patterns.\n\n>A significant rise in sea levels, even by a fraction of a meter, could wreak havoc on tens or even hundreds of millions of people. One study found that although coastal areas less than 10 meters above sea level constitute only 2 percent of the world's land, they contain 10 percent of its population. These coastal zones are vulnerable to storm surges and increased intensity of tropical cyclones—call it the New Orleans Effect.\n\n>Regions much farther inland will wither. Hundreds of millions of people, including many of the poorest farm households, live in river valleys where irrigation is fed by melting glaciers and snow. The annual snowmelt is coming earlier every year, synchronizing it less and less well with the summer growing season, and the glaciers are disappearing altogether.\n\n>Thus, the vast numbers of farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and in China's Yellow River Basin will most likely face severe disruptions in water availability. Yet those regions are already experiencing profound water stress because of unsustainable rates of groundwater pumping performed to irrigate large expanses of northern China and northern India.\n\n>In Africa, all signs suggest currently subhumid and arid areas will dry further, deepening the food crisis for many of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. The severe decline in precipitation in the African Sahel during the past 30 years seems to be related to both anthropogenic warming and aerosol pollutants. The violence in Darfur and Somalia is fundamentally related to food and water insecurity. Ivory Coast's civil war stems, at least in part, from ethnic clashes after people fled the northern drylands of Burkina Faso for the coast. Worse chaos could easily arise.\n\n>Each El Niño cycle brings drying to thousands of islands in the Indonesian archipelago, with attendant crop failures, famine and peat fires. Some climatologists hypothesize that global warming could induce a more persistent El Niño state; if so, the 200 million people in Indonesia and neighboring areas could experience lasting drought conditions.\n\n>Until now, the climate debate has focused on the basic science and the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Attention will now increasingly turn to the urgent challenge of adapting to the changes and helping those who are most affected.\n\n>Some hard-hit places will be salvaged by better infrastructure that protects against storm surges or economizes on water for agriculture. Others will shift successfully from agriculture to industry and services. Yet some places will be unable to adjust altogether, and suffering populations will most likely move. We are just beginning to understand these phenomena in quantitative terms. Economists, hydrologists, agronomists and climatologists will have to join forces to take the next steps in scientific understanding of this human crisis.\n\n\n\nThe only person in this conversation dealing in facts is myself. I have already stated we can adapt to climate change, but pretending as though there won't be massive challenges including issues of food scarcity, issues of violence, issues of water safety, issues of loss of biodiversity, issues of health, etc. is not dealing with facts, it's burying your head in the sand and hoping that the people around you manage to fix the world.\n

> What are these rooms? These rooms are paid for by Foxconn. In China, it's not uncommon for the employer to provide housing for their employees.\n\nI don't want to detract from your post, but for most Western people this would seem like you can't escape work. That is, you're saying it's a selling point, but really you're just turning off everyone who enjoys an even decent worklife balance. \n\n>As for suicide rates? Foxconn, last time I checked had over 750,000 employees (probably more now). 13 suicides in 4 years or whatever that number was? How many suicides occur in Columbus Ohio? Columbus has population of 787,000 people. I guarantee you, Columbus, Ohio has had far more suicides in that same span of time.\n\nAlso you have to be really careful when it comes to statistics, you can't necessarily compare the two. It would be more accurate to compare it to similarly sized companies who have the majority of their workforce living on campus. You have to remember that if I live freely in a town, I can off myself pretty much whenever I want. If I live at my workplace, there will be less opportunities to kill yourself. Now, Foxconn may still have a lower rate of suicide, I'm not taking a position one way or the other, just pointing out you can't make an apples to oranges comparison. 
Challenge yourself to use a touchscreen laptop for a day. You'll quickly realize that Steve was being extremely misleading. No one uses them the way he was saying they do, that would be stupid. It'd be like me saying, hold your phone at arms length and then interact with it. Your arm will get tired, and if you did user testing in that scenario, the results would say touchscreen phones aren't good.  \n\nI normally rest my arm alongside my screen, with my elbow on the desk, and scroll through webpages with my thumb. After scrolling through a PDF this way, you will realise that Steve just had no idea how these things were supposed to be used, and so his user testing data reflects that. \n\nThis idea you somehow need to move your whole arm to interact with a touchscreen laptop is one that needs to die. It's a stupid meme that will vanish overnight when apple finally releases a touchscreen laptop.

You are aware that there are people who cannot be vaccinated due to medical issues right?
I agree with you, but the conversation is focused too much on temperature. The heat waves that OP is referring to aren't just about temperature, they're extreme weather events in and of themselves. The increase in frequency is what's important, not the fluctuation of temperature. \n\nWhen you get an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, that is climate change. You can never say one, or a few of these events is or isn't climate change, that we agree on. But if you had a probability function of the likelihood of that sequence of events in the absence of humans, then you would almost certainly see that it is extremely unlikely to get that many extreme events in such a short period. \n\nUltimately you are correct, but it's more nuanced than simply dismissing any event as not being indicative of climate change. Because you have to remember the climate *has* already changed, and the frequency of heat waves, and other extreme events *is* increasing as a result. \n\n

Here's the thing, the vast majority of people aren't being literal when they say most of Australia is uninhabitable.

The land just doesn't have the resources for it.

> "the poor are getting poorer" which is true practically nowhere.\n\nWealth inequality is however rising, which is true practically everywhere. The vast majority of wealth is controlled by an increasingly shrinking portion of the global population, wage growth is stagnating, and personal debt is increasing. \n\nYeah, lots of things *are* going really great in the world, and people who like to shit all over the present tend to do so because they're misinformed. But let's not pretend it's all sunshine and roses. Especially when you consider things like climate change, which is only going to make the world worse. Violence, poverty, forced migration, food shortage, and job loss are all going to increase. Extreme weather events will become not only more common, but also more severe. It will undo literally everything that is going right in the world at the moment. \n\nYes, we focus too much on the negative, that's true. But just looking at the positives is an even stupider thing to do, because it's akin to closing your eyes and screaming at the top of your lungs.

Guys, I hate to be an arsehole, but parroting off the line about trends without understanding the nuance of a trend is what the actual problem is here. \n\nOP's heat waves aren't just temperature rises, they're *extreme* weather events. The frequency of increasing weather events can't really be compared to the slow rise of the average temperature, of which they contribute to regardless. \n\nDoes an individual cold or warm day mean climate change? No. Do consecutive year on year increases in both global temperature, and extreme weather events mean climate change? Yes. That's what the trend *actually is*.  Is a single, or maybe even a few heat waves indicative of climate change? No. Are massive increases in the frequency and severity of which they occur indicative of climate change? Yes. \n

No offense, but it's waaaaay more likely he or his parents were from the stolen generation, and that his ancestors mixed with and/or were raped by white settlers.

That's pretty damn good tbh. 
You do realise Trump's right arm is on Trudeau's side, whereas Trudeau's isn't on Trump's? There's no other way for him to shake his hand.\n\nAre you dumb?
No offence, but these sound like made up talking points. The liberal party are conservative, but they come nowhere near to the right of the Republican party. The social security system in Australia is leagues ahead of the mess you call social security in America, and we'd probably be considered communist for it 20 to 30 years ago. The ALP are drifting to the right, but are undoubtedly still left of your democrats. Hell, the libs are probably closer to the democrats than they are the republicans. \n\nYeah we treat refugees and certain visa types like absolute shit, but other than that you're quite misinformed if you think the mainstream political parties are to the right of the American ones. \n\nAlso Abbott was primarily elected for offering stability in the wake of the labor leadership crisis. And you guys did elect trump, a guy 1000x worse than Abbott. 
And how does the wall stop the immigrants who don't walk across the Mexican border? A third of immigrants simply overstay their visas rather than enter across the border. Half of all illegal immigrants aren't Mexican anyways. A wall would just make it harder for the immigrants to return home. Back in the 70s, many of the immigrants would only come over as seasonal workers, working for a summer as an agricultural worker or something similar, and then taking the money back home to support their families. The crackdown on immigration has made it harder to cross the border and encouraged many to bring their whole family across so they didn't have to keep crossing the border.  A big wall doesn't solve the problem, it just confounds it.
Plus one issue I have with private charity is that many of them happen to be run through religious organizations, and while there is nothing inherently wrong with that, I wouldn't want to have to listen to a sermon or something every time I went to get canned food.

What's insulting about what I said?
I agree with most of what you said, you probably should have read my comment before writing such a drawn out response. \n\n> It's going to be okay. We're all going to figure it out. The world is currently planning and plotting to ensure the survival of the human race. If we just keep doing what we're doing, and keeping being innovative, we'll be just fine.\n\nOh except for this. You're right we will survive, but you underestimate the impact that climate change will have, and how difficult the challenges will be to overcome. I'm going to be really harsh, and say that attitudes like yours come from the other end of the panic-relaxed spectrum. That attitude doesn't reflect at all the severity of the crisis, or how little time we have to dampen the damage that has already been done. And that's probably actually the key point that people with your attitude don't understand, the damage *has already been done*. Biodiversity is decreasing, ecosystems are struggling to adapt, it's only a matter of time before the spill on effects will become known to us. These are problems that your naive, yes naive, idea of our efforts will not be able to solve. Mitigate? Potentially. Solve? No. \n\nIt's not about whether or not the media scares you, it's about tackling the problem with a clear mind, and weighing up how much effort we should expend to combat the problem. At the moment, we're expending very little actual effort, and had we bothered to deal with this situation earlier, we wouldn't be having to "plot the survival of the human race". Which by the way is absolutely ridiculous. It'll be hard, but humans will survive. It's everything else on the planet that's going to die. 
I wonder how they get the dildo moulds. 
>Because attractive to teenage girls is ubiquitous among adult men (and before you all hem and haw, there is a test, which anyone with any kind of research background or mental health training would already know about. People lie about attraction, but the penis doesn't, and that's what you test).\n\nThat sounds made up. I'm gonna guess a) you made that up and b) you're probably a teenager and so can't understand how the vast majority of teenage girls look like children to adults. \n\n
That's your memory being fallible, it was always keep Summer safe. Next you'll try telling us China never existed or some other dumb Mandela effect bullshit. 
Lol, next time you're in Australia go to the northern territory and spit your rubbish there. You really have no understanding of indigenous Australians, or what indigenous culture means. 
[Keep telling yourself that](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-american-middle-class-hasnt-gotten-a-raise-in-15-years/). Whatever helps you sleep. 
You're supposed to name him and integrate him into your family. He's just like any other pet.
Lol, the price is going to drastically increase.
Fair enough mate, definitely wasn't clear on my end either. 
It's still a very strong topic of discourse in the indigenous community because many of them experienced it first hand. No one is going to say you're a product of rape, but it's a well known fact that it occurred and the repercussions are still felt today among the survivors. 
Yeah, that's the best way to look at it. Yes Apple Care provides good customer service, but if something goes wrong, at the end of the day you can still get a replacement with other manufacturers. Only Apple saves your productivity though, which is the most important difference. 
And this ladies and gentlemen, is why being pedantic is fucking stupid. It's so obvious what /r/thefilmer meant, why do you have to play this fucky game?
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!?!? 
The trend is towards hotter summers, yes this individual summer may not be hotter due to climate change, but the overall trend of hotter summers is. \n\nThat's the nuance missing in this entire thread. Yes, individual climate events aren't reflective of climate change, but consecutive year on year rises in the global temperature, and increases in the frequency of extreme weather events, are reflective of climate change. \n\n
And complained when they overturned Obama's veto because he didn't try hard enough to tell them they shouldn't have. \n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/09/29/politics/obama-911-veto-congressional-concerns/
Another possibility would be to still have multiple districts, but have each district have about 5 representatives or so (at least as close as possible). States which have only a couple representatives would have at-large representatives, and larger states such as CA or TX would still have somewhat local representation. The proportional nature would diminish the effect of gerrymandering and allow minority voters to have some level of say.
Because you can get the effect of what the /u/empocariam mentioned. If there are 10 candidates, but I have only heard about the 5 most well known candidates, and not the 5 fringe ones, I don't really have an opinion on them. I could rank them 6 7 8 9 10, but I would be just as inclined to leave it blank. The idea is to make it easier for voters, and people will complain its too much thinking if they have to pick a number for every single person. They should still be able to vote for more than 1, unlike in Australia, but you shouldn't need to vote on one or all.
Make Donald Drumpf Again? :D
I'm less worried about the teacher's ability to cope and more worried about the many students who are going to be stuck into private charter schools for indoctrination on the taxpayer's dollar. Losing funding will be bad for sure, but the damage to the next generation will be impossible to measure.
As someone in college, college has been, and still is, very much fact based. There may be majors where facts are less important, but logic, reasoning, and critical thinking still are. Professors tend to lean liberal, but you can hardly call it a "leftist education". 
Plus you would also have the pro-life folks that make reasonable exceptions like for the safety of the mother, versus the ones that give no exceptions
I don't know about the previous person, but at least my old university published all of that info because it was a public university. I would try googling, its hard to say where exactly it would be posted.
More than that, you need a 2/3 majority to impeach and convict someone, which the Republicans don't have in either house, so they would need to get Democrats on board, which would never happen, particularly as it would probably be the liberal justices being targeted.
Honestly that would probably hurt Trump more, considering the old folks who wouldn't likely have living parents are his stronger supporters
You're right, but near disasters were also avoided later in the 60s, as well as in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. The greater the tensions in the world, the more likely something like that could happen, regardless of what precautions and protocols we try and use.
Except Russia would have to be crazy to attack in that scenario, so why not let those countries in to rein in Russian aggression rather than let them conquer all of Eastern Europe with no more than a slap on the wrist? 
Carter 2020? He would *only* be 100 when he finished his term.
Plus you don't get that little bit of extra pop.
Be careful what you use, he might enjoy it
Its just about a majority at this point, many polls have him at above 50 percent unfavorability ratings by day 8.
They say it wasn't Russia, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it wasn't Russia. He could be lieing, or it could have gone through an intermediary. I'm not saying that it was Russia, but when you have the intelligence community saying that Russia was up to something this election cycle, I am more inclined to listen to them than Julian Assange.
Its not like illegal immigrants pay into welfare far more than they take or anything
Plus the supreme court could overturn it if it gets conservative enough
Never mind that most of those 10 elections were when the electoral college was much smaller, that would be fake news.
Nope. The wealthiest presidents in modern history had only about 100 million net worth, even Romney with his 250 million (which caused some concern) would have been the wealthiest president besides modern estimates of Washington and Jefferson.\n\nCarter had his peanut farm, but he put it into a blind trust that promptly ran it into the ground. Other presidents had businesses, but they weren't nearly as large in scope or international reach as Donald's.\n
Anarchists protest anything, someone who was truly anarchist would say even Trumps government is too big. Anarchists are the type of people that go out and riot whenever people are out complaining about anything. More people are protesting Trump than did Obama, giving those who just want to go out and cause trouble more chance to do it. Most people (progressive, conservative, independent, whatever) aren't inclined to go out and riot. Most of the protests in the past few weeks have been peaceful, despite being filled with progressives. There were a few instances such as on the inauguration day where there was some rioting, but the majority of people were not responsible.
This is exactly why those in the government should take a stand when they are given an order they feel like they can't follow rather than resign or quietly comply. It will bring more attention and scrutiny to the issue, not compromise any morals, and at least for a short time delay tyranny.
It's not like the West invading the Middle East created the power vacuum that let many of the terrorist groups take hold or anything . . .
Its two elected terms, it doesn't specify 10 years. If you serve more than half of a term it just counts as one of your two. You could theoretically do more, its just 10 is how it works out in the most likely scenario.
>I guess tin foil hats aren't so stupid now.\n\nThey're coming into fashion it seems.
Or as Donald J Trump. 
Its adorable that you don't understand reality.
They are frequencies generally reserved for government use, hence where the conspiracy nuts could at least have part of their premise be correct.
Yeah, we gave him a chance, it took him all of two weeks to blow it once he started naming his choices for cabinet and continued being the same old Donald.
piss
Yeah, if there were more choices it would be less of a concern, but if your only chance to be relevant in national politics (with a few exceptions) is to be R or D, burdensome rules are bullshit.
The Speaker of the House doesn't even need to be a member of the house, it just has always turned out that way. At that point, I would just say lets take Bernie, but that's possibly more of a stretch. A man can dream though.
Yeah, it shouldn't matter, I brought 31 colonists plus over 100 animals and they all made it off the planet (animals included).
And it was in response to a specific event, terrorists who came in as refugees being found in Kentucky. Trump had nothing to prompt this.
The guns in the schools will help with the bears at least
Only if Pence, Ryan, and Bannon go too
No, 4-4 upholds the previous ruling without setting precedent. 5-4 or 4-5 would set a precedent that would be effective nationwide.
Probably because this is in the House I would imagine.
So instead of very good, use great?\n\nVery great idea!\n\n:D\n\nVery can be a lazy word, but it does have its purpose, even if people vastly overuse it.
"Nah, just dust it off and pop'er in there, it'll be fine"
I really wanted Tim Kaine to say, "It's a yes or no question, and if you refuse to give me a yes or no answer, I'm going to take that as a no."
Don't worry, it'll be a thing soon enough.
What happens when they are out of fingers?
You don't have to intend to use them to end up using them, there were cases in the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as other points during the cold war where commanders nearly started nuclear war because tensions were high and they thought the other side had shot first.
Yes, but the chances aren't necessarily great. Apparently on the day WW2 started, another train was supposed to leave Czechoslovakia with another 250 children, but it wasn't able to leave because of the invasion of Poland. Only two of those children survived the war.
But the free market will fix everything and lower prices! Until it's truly free and completely deregulated, prices will continue to rise!! /s
Only took 60 seconds of google searches.\n\nhttp://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-01/study-undocumented-immigrants-pay-billions-in-taxes\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/oct/02/maria-teresa-kumar/how-much-do-undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/\n
She probably went to the girl immediately after placing it, hoping that no one else would go into the bathroom in the 60 seconds it took for the girl to get to the bathroom. Seattle to SF would be a relatively short flight, so I wouldn't imagine there would be that many people going to the bathroom.
Yeah, at least from my (fairly left) point of view, I just view them as the bill for the services the government provides you, both directly and indirectly. Wealthy people tend to benefit indirectly significantly from government funds, such as having their employees educated through public education and allowing them to get to work on public roads, plus they can afford it, so I see no good reason not to bill them a larger fraction. I wonder how they would see this if the government just sent them an itemized bill every year instead of just filing taxes based on income.
Alt-Left? That's a new one
He is talking about 1% chance to win, not 1% polling for him. Most news outlets had him somewhere between 1 and 30% chance of winning the election, depending upon their methodology. Most of them were pretty wrong, but that's what they predicted.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0#other-forecasts
Many do pay income taxes, not all do, but many do pay state or federal income taxes, enough to file
The wording of the amendment is that they may be elected not more than twice, unless they have served more than half of another president's term, in which case they may be elected not more than once. This doesn't prohibit inheriting more than one partial term as VP.\n\n\n"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President, when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term."
Id also imagine some of the conservatives show up due to government functions in the city (however limited they might be in Texas)
I second this comment, what's your set up?
Most of the stuff is likely untrue, but the main point is that it was unverified, most of it has not been **proven** to be false.\n\nCNN's report was on a synopsis of classified documents which had been presented to both Obama and Trump which allegedly contained claims which the Russians had made efforts to compromise him. Some of the materials, in part, came from the same source (who was generally considered trustworthy by the intelligence community), but it was not entirely sourced from, or the same thing as, the dossier. \n\nThe synopsis was published in a government report on the allegations of Russian interference, and consisted of documents that were being circulated in the intelligence community and among senior members of congress and other senior officials.
Many conservatives made it their mission to hate Obama as well as his policies (and convince others to do the same) no matter what he did
They could choose to move an hour ahead (in most places) it would just mean switching time zones entirely.
He stoppped processing Visas in sponse to a specific threat, and didn't ban green card holders.
It has more power, but it still doesn't have any real enforcement capabilities, it relies on the executive branch having some amount of sense and listening to what it rules.
The states which haven't passed it yet aren't likely to do so, plus, if a constitutional convention was enacted, particularly given the polarized state of the country and the fact that one has not happened since the original, it would be a shit-show. It would probably represent its own constitutional crisis as people tried to figure out what the hell is going on. Its not even clear whether it would be limited to the specific topic that called it up or not.
That sounds about right, my first colony ended after a harsh winter which resembled events of the Donner party.
And more people are currently leaving than entering 
Plus if it gets to that point, both the US and China have nukes and we are fucked anyways
Many banks have stopped lending to Trump due to said debt, many more of his loans come from overseas nowadays.
Total number of groups does not correlate with the number of groups active in the US or with the effective strength of those groups in the country. It also does not account for lone wolf type terrorists, of whom there many more possible suspects for christian than islamic terror in the US.
Canada, Australia, and many other countries are parliamentary republics, meaning the parliament chooses the head of state. This makes it more feasible for third parties as they can work together to form a government, particularly when the third parties have regional  appeal.\n\nThe most recent UK election also was a mess, considering FPTP cut some third parties largely out of representation and gave the Tories more representation than they should have. The parliamentary systems are more resistant to Duverger's Law, but they are not immune.
Getting 1/4 of (eligible) Americans to vote for you hardly qualifies you as a unifier, especially given how divisive this election was. If anything most of the unifiying he has done so far has been of his opposition.
**Known** oil reserves are increasing. The amount of actual oil that exists is not increasing at the same rate. Given enough time it will run out. it may not be for hundreds of years, but it will happen. We will have other alternatives by then, but the natural supply of oil will one day run out, whether it be 100 years or 10000 years from now.
Yeah, he had his flaws for sure, but he also did pretty well in other areas. If nothing else, he was at least a respectable person, compared to the man-child in the Oval Office presently.
No meme rules are silly for this reason, any content which bases itself on inside jokes and tropes of a community (like this) can be considered a meme, and many communities turn a blind eye towards "good memes".
That's not as soon as possible
Yeah, that one seems like it would go against the first amendment, so I would imagine that one shouldn't fly, but then again, things aren't always fair or just :/
Yeah, and even if humanity itself survives, civilization, or at least the world as we know it could end. If America and Russia were wiped off the map by nuclear war but everything else was fine, the world would be there, but it would be irreversibly changed. Just because humans would survive doesn't mean we shouldn't avoid it at all costs.
Nope, my muffalos in my game thats gone on for almost 12 years now have a family tree that resembles a ball of twine, it doesn't seem to care about relations
Very tremendous idea, I'll keep that one in mind.
FCC regulation around elections requires stations to charge "the lowest unit charge of the station for the same class and amount of time for the same period" for legally qualified candidates.  Super PACs generally pay market rates for advertising, which during election season is usually 2 to 3 times as much as said "lowest unit charge" depending on market, station, time of day, etc.  It can be as high as 10x but that's pretty rate.\n\nMedia companies love super PACs because election commercials are hideously expensive for non-campaigns.
No, what he is referencing is that many outlets gave him a 1% chance of winning, not that he had a 1% margin. They took all different polling info for different states plus national polls and whatnot and when you factor in the margin of error you can estimate the probability of each outcome. According to their numbers 99 out of 100 times he would lose, but they were underestimating his chances. Not all of the polls were that grim, but many of them had him at 15 percent or less.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0#other-forecasts\n
Ugh, don't make me move to Canada
Yes, but its a slippery slope to further escalation when you have the two nations with the most nukes going toe to toe.
That's not so important with something like this, especially if California is going first. CA has enough people that it should work decently well even if they are the only ones to pass it. In the meantime it can start giving benefits to people now, as well as showing results to convince others to join in. It should definitely leave the door open for a compact, but that would primarily be necessary to ensure interstate coverage for people visiting states which also have single-payer.
Could you move your capital after becoming the hereditary emperor?
The same bible that explains how to give an unfaithful wife an abortion?
Hes also massively pro environment, and provides a well needed voice for the climate. Elon very much cares about humanity as a whole. Like the prior person said, sometimes you have to swallow your pride and do a job, because without you, someone worse will probably get it. If you have a government position currently, it would be better to use your influence to block or slow Trump until you get kicked out than it would be to resign at the start.
Many illegal immigrant pay taxes.\n\nIllegal immigrants aren't eligible for welfare benefits. Even legal immigrants aren't eligible until they have lived here for 5 years.\n\nRemoving illegal immigrants would actually be a net drain to both the economy and the welfare system.
Its one thing to want to stop future visas being given out, its another to prevent people who have already been approved to come into the country, many of whom were already on their way when the order was given. \n\n\nIronically enough, giving people a chance to make it through a door which may close is exactly what Trump just did. Considering that most Islamic terrorism comes from the Muslim countries which weren't affected by the ban, the ban will probably prompt more potential terrorists to try and make it inside the country before any future doors end up closing.
Yeah, its also annoying when a few mention Jefferson as though he was a part of the same party as them.
Can we make this a compact and have the rest of us blue states join in?
Yeah, many of the alt-right don't call themselves Nazis, but they exhibit many of the same fascist tendencies that one would associate with the Nazis.
That they pay taxes?
CNN was reporting on completely unrelated (and verified) accusation which only happened to be at the same time as the unverified (but  not necessarily untrue) Trump dossier.
With most things, given enough support you can reverse anything the president or Congress does. Any damage that is done would still be there, but the law could be restored later. Things would get complicated, however, if the Republicans tried to privatize medicare or social security or gave away public land. It's harder to take things back than it is to give them away.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism#United_States
Are yall looking for any new provinces? I think there are a few of us states which wouldn't mind a new flag right about now
The bag of cat food you buy would be a better choice than Trump.
Unfortunately most of us couldn't be bothered to vote :(
How do we get IL out of the sea of Trump states?
IL here, if we could get the three largest blue states in on that, it would go a long way towards giving this some national momentum.
I honestly didn't think he did.  Maybe I'm totally biased but most of his responses sidestepped the questions that were asked.   I was especially irritated when he brought up anecdotal evidence of bad British medical outcomes when everyone can easily find much worse outcomes in the US. \n\nI thought there were a few questions that Bernie definitely fumbled but if you actually worked through the pile of logic bullshit that Ted Cruz presented, it was obvious that he didn't have concrete proposals for health care reform. 
Definitely.  The reason I stopped was due to the lack of a keto friendly version. 
Doesn't have to be crustless but I actually prefer that crustless is less work and more importantly less carbs.  I like pouring the batter into a casserole dish and freezing it so it pops out like little cheesecake bars. 
Totally understandable and this post was in no means a fishing expedition for insider comment. There are no questions on the table.
That's my opinion as well.  But I trust Bernie and if he supports her in a noncoerced way, I'm willing to get behind that.
Like crustless heaven. 
We're finally getting some press. Can we make #BreakTheBlackout a thing?
That's Kaine.  Mark Warner won his seat in 2014.  So 2014+6=2020.
Likewise looking forward to it.  If you have ideas of other interesting items to publish and need help with code/data wrangling, let me know. :)
Okay.  Spelling it out for you:\n\nThere's no such thing as bad publicity.  Stirring up controversy gets people talking about her.  Those that agree with her will tune in. 
My problem is when I spell shield and they miss their hook and I'm oom.  Lol
We're millenials.  The Internet is our weapon.  The truth will crack any regime we just have to work harder. 
That's too bad.  My boss loves Bernie and so do I.   Unfortunately she can't vote (green card) and I feel inappropriate asking her to donate. :(
Thank you.  Every penny means a lot to our movement.
Chipped in another $50.\n\nUnfortunately, family members want to sit on the sidelines until after Super Tuesday.  They've each promised sizable sums if Bernie wins 4 states tomorrow.  *Fingers Crossed!*
I've never had problems finding matches before but since this afternoon, I haven't been able to get anything through matchmaking.
Thanks.  Data here if anyone wants to take a shot: https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/1000/reports/product_status-stage1
... I think you need more data points.\n\nIt's a narrative I really want to believe but you cant possibly conclude that from 4 states.  (Especially it'd be a negative correlation without tonight's results...
Sigh.  They're not even pretending anymore. 
Everyone go and click so she plays for it 
IMO it's not a matchup problem, it's a being camped problem.  Noc doesn't have a lot of tools to get away from ganks and he quickly pushes lane with his passive.  Even though I've had success playing Noc top, I wouldn't do it unless I had a lot of confidence in my own jungler.
Yes.  So when I "pry" it out, it stops bootlooping and boots into Android. When I hit the button to turn off the screen, about 2/3 of the time, it'll get "restuck" and start bootlooping again. 
She's not getting indicted.  They're just going to drag this into next decade then drop it because all her minions will line up and take the fall in exchange for political favors.
And here I was thinking she would at least pretend to keep this campaign above board.   She's gone full negative.  It's so insulting to have her imply that people who vote for Bernie are just people who don't do their own research.  Is that why she won mostly in states with the lowest Internet access rates? 
Noone is bidding in the American Samoas.  For $5k and some legal costs, you can have 10 whole Mhz of airwaves all on your own.
I actually have a similar experience to you.  I lost 30 lbs over a five month span two year or so ago before getting pretty sick and 'falling off the wagon' so to speak.  I never really got back on, even though I did permanently kick sodas and candy bars. \n\nIt took me a year and a half to gain back the first ten pounds then six months to gain the next ten.  I'm on keto again and hope to never see that last 10 come back. 
Investors, especially institutional ones,  aren't dumb.  Those trying to correlate Trump tweets vs stock prices are hacks that don't have better things to write about.
If this is what our donation money is putting together, I'm going  back into that couch and vacuuming up a few more hundred dollars. \n\nAmazing work. 
People need to understand not to fall for Trump's troll bait and never take him at his word.  Focus on his policies and what he does.  The rest is hot air. 
I've met him in in real life and he's a lot worse.  Trust me.
If you're playing ADCs often, you're probably used to extended trades where you run after each other auto attacking and stuff.  Trading in mid lane tends to be short and bursty where people try to hit skill shots and minions at the same time. 
San Diego zoo must be number one. 
Because we're not Republicans and we actually trust each other. 
Oh right.  Derp
Uh no.  The whole reason there is a labor dispute is because Verizon is trying to get out of certain markets and they're cutting staff to do so.  Sadly, boycotting those particular products will only reinforce their point. 
Ooohhh and cheese crisps.  Super fast and easy to make in the oven. 
Eagle Pass, Texas is a town on the US-Mexican border.  The color code is price/mhz/pop as the standard metric for how expensive spectrum is.  The Y axis is how much the aggregate demand (number of licenses bid upon) exceeds the supply of licenses available for that PEA (Partial Economic Area)
That or pharma lobbying money moves to Canada and screw up their system too.
After writing a hefty check to the IRS, I'm completely tapped out until the next paycheck (read: no gas money).  If Bernie wins NY, I'll be able to max out until the General Election.   Hope all the other Bernie supporters out there can keep the money flowing until then. 
Here's a map of the PEAs courtesy of FCC for providing shapefiles.\n\nhttps://gimperion.github.io/pea_map/\n\n
On a personal note, my #1 issue is the rejection of the TPP.  Hillary was very much a force behind it as Secretary of State and even though she has come out against it, the talk in lobbyist circles is that she'll support it once she is in office. \n\nMy view is that there's actually a good chance of her reversing course and if we can't trust this one campaign promise, what can we trust?  At least with Trump, you'll know when to bend over. 
Titles aside, companies hiring for ML roles look more at demonstrated skills,  less at credentials.  Apply to what you have your eyes on.  If you can do well with technical questions, more power to you.   If not, you at least have experience with a data science oriented technical interview. 
Correct on # of bids minus # of available licenses.\n\nNot entirely sure what's driving the bidding.  The auction rules are pretty complex but essentially each geographic area (PEA) requires a certain number of bidding units per bid. Think of it like poker chips.  You can only use the chips you keep on the table.  You can take some off the table, but you can't bring them back.\n\nSome analysts are saying that someone is stashing all their chips in a meaningless market like Eagle Pass, TX but I think there might be a more substantive story there.  I was hoping reddit can sniff it out.
This is part of the Internet battle.  Let's get #ColoredPeopleTime trending now! 
It's a term.\n\nGood ol' days of Macro 1 in college.
Yeah it took almost 4 weeks.
I meant with donations.  California voters get the luxury of sitting around until the end. :D
Ignore her.  Her ratings are pathetic and she's obviously trolling for raging from Bernie supporters to boost it.
Short answer is to kill them.  Long answer is that you need to visualize how this will go during champion select with your support.  Tanky playmaking supports are best under this situation. Also bursty ADCs with very defined power spikes (Tristana lv 4 and Draven lv 6) also help. 
Crony capitalism relies on information scarcity to survive.  Uneducated voters will generally pick the candidate that is hand picked for them.  For us to win, we need to get the word out.\n\n
Most drugs that would've been covered under this will are already FDA approved for the US market, manufactured in the US, and EXPORTED to Canada at far lower prices.  All this would've done is allowed us to repurchase these drugs from Canadian middlemen that have access to these at much lower prices.\n\nIn the long run, the actual effect will be that pharma companies will  decide to cut out the middlemen and sell locally at reasonable prices.
Not really crunchy texture, but you can make strawberry cream cheese fat bombs with a little water blended in.  Pour into ice tray and toss in freezer.  They'll be relatively hard and fruit flavored. (like frozen cheese cake) 
In that context, yes, $125k a year is more than enough for a person.  I make close to said amount but I pay $1900/month for a small two bedroom apartment in a low income neighborhood.   
Shame on Jill. This is a waste of money considering Standing Rock and so many other causes that could desperately use one tenth of this money.  The election is over and if the winner is changed e will have blood in the streets before the year is out. 
Green cards can
Try paprika and garlic powder. 
You can get unsweetened baking chocolate, melt it down, gently, whisk in heavy cream and some butter/coconut oil for your chocolate cravings.  Just like the real thing but helps you with your macros. \n\nSweeten (or not) as your diet allows. 
We have 4 years to find a challenger.  Ideas on who might want his seat? 
By the bowl, I'd go with Kale chips, nori (seaweed), and pork rinds come to mind.  I also make fat bombs for the sweet tooth.  \n\nIn limited amounts, bacon crumbles, roasted chick peas, small handfuls of almonds have also worked for me. \n\nOh and always cheese in most forms. 
This more than anything else is a measurement of the reach of the MSM.\n\nWhen people are on the outside and there isn't MSM brainwashing going on, Bernie is a significantly stronger candidate.
They're going to borrow $40 Billion to finance this deal.  Good luck with 5G deployment on the AT&T network after this.  
Me too.  I travel a ton for work and I definitely can donate. 
There have been quite a few of these floating around by now.  Maybe instead of airing commercials, the campaign should experiment with putting some of these into less expensive advertising spots for those who have already tuned out the official ads.

It's got a ton of delegates and it's a measurement of momentum.  Bernie's campaign is counting on a win in Michigan to "turn the tide" for all the other swing states coming up (Ohio, Florida, etc.)
Oh the irony.  One of the main arguments amongst cozy establishment folk is that Bernie isn't helping the party, just himself.  
Not defeated by a long shot but thanks for keeping spirits up. 
The problem in this particular case is information asymmetry.  If you look at Donald Trump, he had quite a bit of name recognition coming into the Republican primary and his vitriol spikes ratings which then gets him free coverage and media.  The more information asymmetry is a problem (South Carolina) the more of an advantage Hillary will have due to sheer name recognition from Bill and other coverage.  \n\nIf you look at a large swath of the poorer areas of South Carolina, most of the voters had never heard of Sanders and don't care to (or are too busy to) research.  The message, as you said, is very important but it's not very useful if no one hears it.
Feel free to share as you see fit. :)
Bernie is the candidate that America aspires to be.\nTrump is the candidate that America deserves.\nHillary is the candidate that America settles for.\n\nSorry but #NotSettling.
It'll be super easy to convince them once they've put a few hundred dollars in.  I was just hoping they'd do it tonight instead of after tomorrow.
Make your own. If you don't mind making it into a fat bomb, just buy unsweetened baking chocolate, melt it down with coconut oil.  Then slowly whisk in heavy cream until you're satisfied with it.  (and yes, do count the carbs as you add it in) \n\nFor us mortals that occasionally compromise with sucralose, Torani sugar free smores syrup is fantabulous in the concoction as well. \n\nPour into ice tray and freeze.  They're amazing when you just need a chocolate pick me up at half a carb or less apiece. 
Stealth.  It happens.

Probably.  Mini muffin tins also work great.   That's what I use but I figured that was more rare than ice tray. 
Trying to fight Super PAC money by giving to Bernie is pretty good ROI.  Since they don't pay the same rates for advertising and other campaign activities, you're basically getting a 2:1 or 3:1 ROI to fight fire with fire.
The media is what the media is.  We should be taking advantage of all the opportunities to get Bernie's message out regardless of the wretched situation that got us this media attention. 
I'm a total Bernie fan and have donated $500+, so believe me when I say, that as much as I want this to happen, THE INDICTMENT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.  Stop putting your hopes and dreams on this fantasy scenario and go phonebank.\n\n
It'll take more than theatrics on the Senate floor for me to get excited about Warren again but I don't think Bernie holds a grudge against her.  If he endorses her, and that's a massive if, I'm willing to vote and donate to her campaign.
If you have minion advantage, poke them back and start a fight.  If you don't, ping wildly and berate your adc for not pushing the lane.  (jk on the later part) 
Wait, what's with this standing vs sitting fuckery? People stand up to wipe?
You're right of course.  It's the same asinine logic that people used when they tried to sue Xerox every time someone copied copyrighted material.  This type of legal logic is not only toxic to innovation but incentizes value extraction through frivolous lawsuits.  \n

It's possible.  The polls are discouraging but again, delegates are allocated proportionately.  If you think the actual gap is 20 points, cutting it down to 10 will drastically help us stay in the race past March 15.
I know "corporate welfare" is seemingly a terrible thing, but can we get off the Ex-Im topic for a bit?\n\nExport-Import bank is less corporate welfare and more market lubricant.  It provides financing and insurance for major business deals where normal banks are unable to do so (ie airplane sales.)  Ex-Im turns a profit every year and is NOT being supported on the taxpayer's dollar.\n\nInstead of trying to close the bank, what the government should do is make Ex-Im less exclusive and more available to small businesses.  I'm against corporate welfare like the rest of you, but when we can help American businesses FOR FREE (and a small profit actually), why the hell wouldn't we?

Okay I might have to back away from this a bit because it's different based on what state you are.\n\nMost states have regulations restricting the circumstances under which you can conduct partisan voter registration drives.  This can either be illegal or it might be the organization doing it would jeopardize their tax exempt status.  \n\nTalking a potential voter into registering for one party over another is explicitly "partisan."
Dual income family of 4 living in DC/NY/SF basically.  In DC, houses near anything metro accessible is easily $2M and up.  This isn't living the high life in penthouses, this is living comfortably in suburbs near the city.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good lifestyle but far from 'wealthy.'

Oh, corporatist *representatives*. That's a solid goal. I thought you meant corporatist *voters* and I was confused.
> However, clearly there is opposition to federal funding of the arts, so it cannot be argued to be a role of the government as willed by the people\n\nIs that all it takes? For opposition to merely exist? I know plenty of people who would prefer the government not create roads.
Nobody's talking about the real mystery here.\n\n>On Hasbro's earnings call last week, leadership spoke about the success of *Pie Face*\n\nHow is that successful? It's a little catapult that you put some whipped cream on and then it [smacks you in the nose](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/c2ad3c8d-3ec0-497c-935e-687e96ff5c05_1.c726d77aa00f230a68724ee5547534fa.jpeg).

"I'm not a Trump supporter, but people being opposed to him is exactly how he won."
> He dismisses opposing voices for the same reason a manager at McDonald's would fire someone for not following the rules he makes: It's his administration, they are his employees, and they follow his marching orders (within the law and duties of a public servant).\n\nHe doesn't make the rules. He's not the legislative branch. He doesn't get to decide what's constitutional. He's not the judicial system.\n\nYou just said that it's the responsibility of the people to lobby their representatives to have their views heard, but now you're saying that the president is like a McDonald's manager and has no responsibility to us?\n\n> I doubt Obama would have behaved much differently if someone publicly dissented against his agenda.\n\nObama never fired an Attorney General for telling him what he's doing is illegal. He also never said to blame our American system of checks and balances for terrorist attacks. You can't just say "Obama would have probably done that". Other officials dissented against his agenda all the time and he did not react the way that Trump does.
> How people pay for it is entirely their problem and not the burden of the state, because it is extra, optional education, not a right (IMO).\n\nJust because it isn't a right doesn't mean that the government shouldn't provide it to people who couldn't pay for it themselves.\n\nI'm sure the majority of public services you consume wouldn't be considered rights, either.
> And the prevailing tone of posts regarding the RL is one treating their desire to play Legacy as a right (or entitlement) to do so.\n\nIt's more "there's no reason that Legacy should be this expensive". And if Wizards had any interest in wanting people to play Legacy, it would be a bad business move. However, it looks like it's an aberration and Legacy players are just playing Magic in an unintended, undesired way.

Well, I wasn't with you before, but now you've really made your point about Wonder Woman.
Bendis can't even remember that Drax isn't an alien and Knowhere isn't a planet.\n\nHell, he did a flashback to The Thanos Imperative and made Star-Lord a blond with an element gun.
Right, I'm sure "they are the past" meant "they will be on our side in the future" and "they can't be reasoned with" meant "they see it our way more and more".
Don't forget championing the Confederate flag, a nation that fought a war with the US and lost completely in the 19th century, while also attacking others as "un-American" and telling them to get over losing the election immediately after it ended.
> It's one thing when they change the visual style, but when it undergoes a whole overhaul, I don't think it usually works out very well.\n\nThe funniest thing about it is that McNiven redesigned the cast in anticipation of the MCU, trying to anticipate a "cinematic" look by putting the cast in generic Mass Effect armor.\n\nThen the movie didn't go that way at all and produced a look that was closer to their Annihilation-era designs than to McNiven's.
Boy, Sorin was a good character before that.
If public transportation is worth tax money, so is public education.
Notice that you considered the remark insulting without knowing what specifically I meant by it. Even without knowing whether it's false or true, you took offense because of the subtext of the statement. That should be an indicator that pointing to statistics has little bearing on the validity of Wonder Woman's reaction.
> I suspect there's many, many casual players who only go to the mothership for news.\n\nWell, now the casual base will know about all the experiences being planned for enhancement using new synergized redefinitions of engagement.

"Anti" means "against". Conservatives in the US tend to oppose things solely because they help gay people, or they mean gay people will be more visible, or they will let gay people do things only straight people can do. It's just a matter of not wanting them around in general.
I'm confused by how "move past politics" and "do not waste energy defending our government" applies to someone dissenting from defense of the President.
That's not even what it was.
"Okay, I'm replacing Morrison. Time to redo the valuable character development Morrison did but without all the cerebral occult references and metatextual mindfucks so people will notice!"
They're genuinely defending the sub in the comments.
Well, sure, I agree with that.\n\nBy the way, do you have any idea why am I being downvoted exactly once on every comment I make in this thread?
>Calling anyone you oppose politically a fascist, racist, sexist, etc.,\n\nYou presume too much. I only call someone a fascist when they oppose democracy and Constitutional checks on executive power in favor of an authoritarian, ultra-nationalist regime. What term would you use?
There's this weird doublethink going on where the sub considers the president to be the government's enemy because he got elected spouting nationalist, xenophobic things that are normally the realm of the "Hitler was right" sort of conspiracy theorists.\n\nSo now they're under the impression that anyone who criticizes the leader of the government is just a shill for the government. Here, it's considered unpatriotic to criticize the person on top of the power structure because he claims to be against the power structure even as he puts down orders that attack our freedoms.
So does this mean that my remark isn't insulting if it's true?
That person was mistaken -- Dr. Manhattan meddled with the entire timeline, deaging and grimdarking the New 52 universe in general. Lois and Clark here are actually the pre-reboot versions, so they're exempt.\n\nWith Rebirth, it looks like the idea is that after Watchmen ended, Manhattan left for a different universe, and ended up involved in the recreation of the universe following Flashpoint somehow. It seems like he decided to make it more cynical and edgy out of some interest in or opposition to love and optimism.\n\nBasically the meta-story of Rebirth is commentary on how DC took the wrong lessons from Watchmen and the New 52 ruined what fans liked so much about the DC Universe for the sake of seeming "grounded" and "gritty".
You do a lot of scrounging through Reddit history for insults for someone who wanted to take the intellectual high ground a few comments ago.
> Paying for roads, some sort of military to guarantee sovereignty and security, and a police force are accepted by most people\n\nThose aren't rights, either. Why not have people pay to have the laws protect them? And if the military is so important, surely it can sustain itself without relying on the government.
From what I can gather, it's because Trump is on their "team", and the government, left or right, is the "other team". Now Trump is the leader of the other team.\n\nSo the cognitive dissonance sets in: this guy is supposedly against the powers that be, but he is a high-ranking member of those powers and is doing things that serve them at the expense of the people. But that doesn't fit. So anything that suggests he's just another corrupt, militaristic President has to be discarded somehow.
Did you actually wring your hands for three minutes when you said you would?
That was his... 2001? miniseries, IIRC. I don't know much about Drax in the 90s, but what little I've seen of him then, he still wore his superhero costume and was completely lucid.\n\nThe 2000s mini is when he got his shirtless barbarian look, as far as I know, and he was stupid in the "learning to talk" sense, not the "out of touch" sense.\n\nThe thing the movies eschewed (and thus Bendis completely forgot) is that Drax isn't an alien. He's an Earthling who was transformed into a musclebound green champion of life in order to kill Thanos.
But Trump didn't run on the Kill PBS platform. He never said "vote for me and I'll end the NEA", so how does the way people voted come in? This isn't even a Congressional act. He's going to kill it via executive order.\n\nYou can't pin this on the people at all, since their opinion on PBS has no say in this whatsoever.
I said "PR disaster", not "natural disaster".
> Somehow the text did not display.... :(, so I post it here.\n\nYou can post a link/image or text, but not both.\n\nIf you want to make a text post, stick the image link in the text.
> I don't have to "convince people" to come to my side. Clinton's people are old and dying.\n\nIf your plan for a better country requires 65 million people to die for your side to come to prominence, then you need to improve your plan.
So far Trump has only done things that increase that abuse, like putting gag orders on scientists to prevent them releasing their data without his administration approving the research.\n\nEverything he's said about needing to get "tough" and "vigilant" is the same rhetoric that led us to the Patriot Act in the first place. He's ranted against judicial review because protecting the Constitution "makes us weak".\n\nHe is not in opposition to abuse of power when he's the one holding that power.
Purged how?
"Sweden is a fake country."
They start with a full bowl and their neighbor has an empty one. When someone puts a bit in their neighbor's bowl, they say "that's unfair, you only gave something to them! That's special treatment!"
I thought that "cumulatively a ton of people" would give it away, but alas, my sarcasm was too believable for this world.
So basically you're saying that the democrats are the boy who cried fascist and they're helpless now that an actual fascist has showed up and is trying to destroy the press and the judicial system.
Counterpoint: I'm a man and Venus Williams could kick my ass.
Dude, you shouldn't just call anyone you oppose politically a fascist. That devalues it.
I seriously thought this was where they were going with Brisela, planning to make her a reincarnation of Ulamog.
> they'd see that this guy isn't a fascist spewing hate, someone to be feared; he's an idiot and someone to be pitied and ignored.\n\nMuch like Trump, he can be both at once.\n\n> MY's power doesn't come from HIS ability to rile up the alt-right. His power comes from riling up the LEFT and the alt-right trolls respond to THAT.\n\nThat's the trouble with bullies. Respond too much and they feed on it. Respond too little and they get to punch people out with impunity.
If the focus leaves gun control, it'll just recenter on abortion. "The left wants to kill babies!" Nobody is going to vote for a party that they think wants to kill babies.\n\nAnd if it's not abortion, it's LGBTQ rights. "Transgenders want to pretend to be men so they can go into the bathrooms and molest our kids!" And now voters will be reactive and angry because the left supports hypothetical child molesters.
When you start saying that the judicial system is bad because it stops the president from being able to violate the Constitution to serve xenophobic, nationalist interests... you're a fascist, in my book.
Okay, yeah, I can see that. I guess I'm just out of touch with what the kids find fun. I don't think I would've been into this at the right age for it, I was too into action figures and videogames... but I can see the appeal.\n\n(For the record, I was looking for 'why is it making a ton of money' when I asked why it's successful. Which is why your initial answer didn't work for me.)

Well, you've convinced me.
It's for a completely different game, Dungeons and Dragons. This is meant to help D&D players create stories in the game that take place on Kaladesh, the latest MTG setting.
Conservatives want government to require women in abortion clinics get transvaginal ultrasounds whether or not they consent to them. If that's on the right side of the line between what government should and shouldn't do, then public literacy programs should be firmly in the "should" category.
> President Donald Trump is a threat to the Deep State.\n> They are attacking him by every avenue available to them, and they are about to lose spectacularly.\n\nWow, /r/conspiracy really loves the leader of the government.
A lot of breakfast foods are loaded down with carbs so that people who did a lot of manual work could have the energy to spend on it.
Probably too obscene for Threadless.
I guess that the question is what "giving up on the gun issue" actually entails. Does it mean ignoring how broken the way we deal with the gun industry is? Does it mean not trying to take away Americans' guns (when the Democrats weren't doing that)? Does it mean a light rhetorical shift to focus on the laws that already exist? Because the third one is the only one that makes sense to me. 
The one that conspiracy theorists point to the most is "the government is recording all our cell phone calls in a database somewhere." That went from something we joke about because it's so out there to something we joke about because everyone knows about it happening.
And the citizens know that your party is for them because... you call them "Hillbots" and tell them they're too ruled by their own greed and arrogance to see the truth?
Yeah, it's a major semantic disconnect right now. From what I can tell, a lot of gun owners are perfectly okay with a lot of the specific concepts that gun control advocates want, like the ones you mentioned. But that gets lost in the teamsportsification of the issue... it becomes a hot-button word that both sides wrestle over without being able to boil down what it actually means.\n\nAnd the NRA gets to come in and endlessly fearmonger on behalf of gun companies whose sales spike from it.
The control-change effect doesn't start caring about when MRB becomes untapped until it resolves. Before that, it can tap and untap repeatedly.

Check out /r/conspiracy right now. Their narrative is that the President is an anti-establishment opponent to power trying to reduce government corruption and it's anti-American to make up all these unproven allegations about him.
Most jobs require literacy. PBS taught me to read.
Maro claims it was the other way around and Ajani and Garruk weren't part of Origins because they had become multicolor, so Gideon and Nissa replaced them.
So what recourse do the American people have here? Trump already dismisses opposing voices because they're lying losers.
> But does he whine and complain about how the world needs to change for him to make sure his fears don't come true?\n\nWait, are you calling opposing your family getting arrested for no reason "whining and complaining"?
Graphs? That's pretty high-level for someone like you.
Ah, yes, Drax, that silly alien who doesn't understand humanity or jokes.

To be clear, Roman numerals signify chords, and in Annie's case, yes the melody is 5 5 3 5 1 2 3, but the chords underneath in the pdf are simply I (during 5 5 3 5 1) - V (during 2) - I (on the final 1). At least for the first appearance of the melody. So I'm not sure if you meant to put V-V-iii-V-I like that. 
Cat.
The statement has no actual, direct meaning behind it. It was a rhetorical device which would illustrate why your graph-based approach to the original post was irrelevant. In showing why there is only one interpretation for such a remark, you have in fact undermined your point for the similar remark which that comic contained. Do you see now? By flipping around your argument and creating a situation in which you would experience the very insult which you had made efforts to excuse, causing you to argue that it is inexcusable, I have deftly allowed your unambiguous rightness on this matter to reflect poorly upon the argument you made in the other direction in the earlier comment. This has allowed me to simply prompt you into demonstrating in your very comments why telling someone that they are a good thing while limiting it to being for the group they are in, and not a good thing in general, is necessarily a condescending gesture. I have been able to step aside and minimally interfere as you do this thing -- in fact, the more evasive I was, the more you doggedly pursued your effort to cement the point I was making on my behalf. This feat of argumentative judo, I hope, will give you pause to reflect on other perspectives of the issue at which your earlier arguments were thrust.
> If you want your child to receive extra, out of public school education, then do it yourself or pay for it yourself, don't make EVERYONE pay for it.\n\nHow about this: when I can choose not to pay for a massively bloated military budget, for the militarization of local police forces, for all the expenses incurred by lodging Secret Service members at Trump's building and holding Trump's state meetings at his own restaurant, for subsidies to companies that can more than afford not having them, and every other waste of money much bigger than PBS... maybe then PBS can show up on our list of priorities.\n\nUntil then, that extra $2 in your taxes that has caused massive public good for the nation as a whole should not be in the President's crosshairs.
> Thanks for all the info, but what do you mean by 10 years ago? Since New 52 is only, what, 2 or 3 years old, were they thrown back in time or something\n\nThe New 52 kicked in with about ten years of history behind it. Five years of Batman lurking around as an urban legend, Superman developing from a cocky teenage farmboy to the frat bro the reboot made him, that sort of thing... then five years of the Justice League forming and the "age of superheroes" coming to fruition.\n\nThis is because they were rebooting right in the middle of Grant Morrison's and Geoff Johns's massive five-year runs on Batman and Green Lantern and didn't want to cut them off right in the home stretch. So we start off in the New 52 with Batman having had four Robins, one of which is his ten-year-old son, and there being seven colors of Lanterns and all that jazz.
Nobody wants people who look at art to run a country?
Felidar Guardian combo and Winding Constrictor overpowering cheese garbage.

> It's more like time was literally stolen from Lois and Clark. So Lois and Clark got de-aged.\n> Honestly, we don't know the full story. It's implied Dr. Manhattan did it for evil reasons, but we don't know if that's really the case or not.\n\nNo, no, that's the Nu52 world. This Lois and Clark are the ones we were supposed to come back to, but Manhattan meddled in the timeline and we got Superbro and his work friend instead.
Is that a threat to the *deep state* or a threat to the *state*? If my boss was replaced with someone completely unqualified who keeps making PR disasters on a daily basis and keeps sending angry tweets about how legal checks on his power are a threat to the company, I'd be really unhappy.\n\nJust because he's not "glossed" doesn't mean the things he's doing benefit you or anyone else who isn't part of the "elites".
Well, glad we settled that talking to someone like that is insulting. I hope this answered your original question.
> Then the school system and your parents failed you; government programming should not be responsible for your education.\n\nThis was before I was old enough for kindergarten. Educational programming enriched me and set me ahead.\n\n>  This does not change the fact that if PBS lost federal funding, either they could adapt as a normal business that your parents could pay for or find a similar alternative.\n\nTLC tried that. "The Learning Channel" used to be public, then it went private. In competition for ratings, educational programming lost out. Now it's nothing but vapid reality shows about child beauty pageant contestants and being obese.
But where does that leave Vraska?
The phrase "fake news" was coined to describe actual hoax articles -- not satire sites like The Onion, but straight-up fabricated nonsense designed to get lots of social media play from people who only read headlines.\n\nThen it was co-opted to describe anything that criticizes the government.
If the President publicly insulting private companies for their business decisions affecting his family and telling off the courts for ruling that his decisions are illegal *weren't* PR disasters, something would be wrong.\n\nHis moves haven't been PR disasters because they were "played up", just because of what he openly says and does.
Looks like it, I'm also just finding this out
Ah, well then it's the stairs providing the reverb. Still not how it would sound in a normal room.

It's in the nation's interest to stimulate mental and emotional development as well as encourage cultural development. America is better off when its populace is well-educated and its arts are thriving.\n\n> if that were true it would be an easy sell to switch to a private enterprise and pay for itself instead of requiring the government to stay operational.\n\nWhat private enterprise is doing what PBS is doing and staying operational entirely off public funds?\n\nAnd how would you expect the people who benefit most from PBS -- parents of young children, people who have an interest in programming like Frontline but can only get it through network television -- to be able to pay for it entirely themselves?
It makes the President look very bad when he starts trying to convince the public that the judicial system is a bad thing.
> Rhetoric didn't lead us to the Patriot Act. The War on Terror led to the Patriot Act. 9/11 led to the Patriot Act.\n\nThe Patriot Act soared through Congressional and popular approval because of the narrative that we need to give up our freedoms to protect us from foreign threats. 9/11 and the War on Terror were used as excuses to cement that narrative.\n\n> Do you seriously come here to argue while simultaneously ignoring what the base of this sub's views are? I can't speak for everyone, but damn...\n\nIsn't this sub normally opposed to cracking down on individual freedoms in the name of "national security"? Am I wrong there?\n\n>And the point I was trying to make was that of course people here are going to side with Trump on this issue. I'm not a Trump supporter. Go ahead and comb through my post history.\nFuck the CIA. Fuck the NSA.\n\nThe fallacy here is treating these like two sides in a conflict, as if Trump is opposed to the security state rather than an advocate of it. Individuals within an agency leaking things doesn't indicate the position of the entire agency. Individuals like that are how we know about the NSA's abuses in the first place.

I think I remember hearing that they somewhat clarified the time in that Last Hours thing, and it definitely was a ways into the future, at least enough to assume the main Half-Life events are over. Can't remember exactly.\n\nAlso old aperture seems a lot lower and kind of walled off entirely so I could see it being preserved a little better from the elements.
I'd guess that many people's masturbation habits are already unhealthy. NoFap is likely about regaining control and lessening the addictive qualities.
He made such an effort to befriend you? No doubt he has deliberated nervously over every text. I don't think INTPs lazily befriend people. If you're being actively befriended, there's "something" about you. So go for it is what I'm saying.
Update: seems my last few coils actually were the problem. Swapped another one in and I can screw fully tight and it tends to read .21 now. 
Who foots the bill for all these beers? 
Yeah but the look on his face said he thought his throw was good enough to end it.

I'm still working on the convincing part. What's funny is that, even if I were excited about Friday, I'd still have trouble responding to an acquaintance with ease. It still has to pass through the try-to-make-this-seem-like-a-normal-response routine, which garbles it up a bit. 
Maybe I'm high, but man JJ has the best little phrases. "The Flyers arrive in ill humor" is one of faves.
Low effort, low energy, wrong. Bad. Not very good, folks. \n\nAm I speaking your language yet? 
The issue is that he rarely says or admits he's uninformed. Why can't he just say, I didn't know x, I'm being briefed on y, I've changed my mind because [logic]? He seems more concerned with protecting the idea that he can't be wrong. I understand why it worked in the election, but surely you can see how that's a scary trait in a president?

They didn't look dejected to me until after the 2nd goal. Lots of bad bounces, questionable officiating, and some defensive breakdowns, but the flyers are getting chances, just not scoring.
You started it
Yeah this. Cheatin, man, cheatin.
So much yes. It's like reverse Eric andre
I've seen a wawa that seemed to have salads you can order and customise to an extent. Perhaps something is being phased back in.
Been seeing a lot of posts about student discounts and I'm also considering going some time with a friend. Is there a consensus on when to show up, if you're hoping for 2 seats together? 
I've been wondering this each of the three times I've scrolled back to this today. 
Just do what my family does and wrap a picture of the thing you ordered and explain when they open it. 
Also, I happen to like the bar seats. More room you can still see fine  (although when the puck gets close you may have to lean or prop yourself up off the chair, but when that happens I'm usually already primed to stand if something exciting is happening). And if you stand up, you're not blocking anyone's view.
Well I could see myself liking someone bc they like physics. But also physical attraction, which I can't speak for. But if it was "she likes physics" + "I'm attracted to her" then I'd probably end up trying to befriend. Good luck. As others have said, he will be receptive to directness. Worst case is he says no, and if he's like me, he'll try to do that in the nicest way possible (but still maybe struggle). But yeah, directness. 
What gets me is that they took the effort to coordinate with the end of the song, so that the quick cuts lined up with the crescendo. Lol
Just chiming in to endorse Team Balls. 
Yeah, I think I've been getting better with initial fear of rejection. But there's now this secondary thing where if I start to see someone more often, I get sucked in a little too easy and risk coming on strong. But this happens even when I innately feel that I don't or won't connect with this person as much as I'd like, and can guess there would be no sustainable future. I think maybe a part of me is seeing less contact with [new person] as a form of rejection. Even though I can sit and tell me self "she's not my type, don't worry about it, maybe even break it off on purpose" I'll still end up fussing over it more than I should and suddenly getting involved.\n\nThat was most of last year when I met a girl in my first year of grad school. Lasted months longer than it should have but there I was sleeping over every night. Now there's a new girl and some stuff happened and now here I am monitoring her snap stories. I can't seem to get myself to not care as much.\n\nOf course there's more here than fear of rejection. My living situation is weird atm so it's probably an escape thing as well, idk. 
The sound is definitely modified with some reverb and stuff to make it sounds nice. We're not hearing it as it's naturally heard.
I know station size is a factor, but larger stations still leave me with 9 max. Is the track length also a factor? 
Yeah wtf, title totally indicates Eric saying this to Lazzo
Most of my searches are coming up with fixes for a pin for the battery. No issues with my battery I don't think. I do feel like I remember a video about messing with the center pin, just can't find any atm

https://soundcloud.com/humanest-humanist/sets/extrasensory-1/s-VVKt6\n\nI'd have gotten back to you earlier, but it's been a crazy week. I gotta say, it's refreshing how open you seem. I may have to take you up on some venting, but that's a bit of a rabbit hole. As for my "light at the end of the tunnel" comment, I was rambling and it was kind of vague. In part, I was referencing that I'll finish my master's in May and start a job that will pay well and allow me to focus more on my music on the side. Currently taking a class in Max/MSP and Logic, which I'm already familiar with. Really hoping to expand my technical capabilities. Anyway, it'd be great to hear feedback on this first project. Cheers!
Clement touched on something I hadn't thought of in post game. Neuvy is a touch quicker than Mase. Our so says bill. But Neuvy is smaller. What he lacks in size he makes up for in laser moves. This may be partly why I've grown to like him. They can both make the same save, but Neuvy's may look cooler because of the way he flashes the pads. His nimbleness can go a long way. And I get the sense that he's more level headed. Not sitting on Mase here, but last year it took BOTH to get to the playoffs, and I'm thinking we may be on the cusp of a positive Neuvy steak. 
I did say "if"
https://soundcloud.com/humanest-humanist\n\nSo if you get around to it (and thanks in advance), I only have one song up. If you like it, I can send you the private link to the unreleased 5-song EP that I'm dragging my feet to release. Bout to check your stuff out. Cheers.
EHT opened up a reserve on Zion Rd. Kinda small, but there's some interesting trails and a lake sort of thing.
No
Hmm, curious, did all 5 tracks show up? Wasn't sure based on your language and now that I think of it, there may have been another time that link was fucky. Just curious what you see when you click. Thanks for the kind remarks.
Yeah it's like, there's a lot of shit going on so it's easy to put it off. It's done, with the exception of one spot I was hoping to fix (probably inaudible to anyone but me). Plus my friend and I are trying to formulate this music collective sort of online presence thing locally, and my project may be among the first releases with that thing, which might fail, or turn into something cool. I'm deep into ep2 now which is shaping up to be better than this first one, so... one step at a time. Now I'm just venting, probably due to my current isolated circumstance. Life be heavy. Light at the end of the tunnel though. The end.
Right in the tastes
I don't think it's the coil, as this issue has happened on multiple coils. The issue is that it shorts out, with a flashing 0.00 reading, when it reads below .2, which it tends to when screwed in securely. 
Now *you're* doing it?
Was looking for this comment... definitely not stylized as "WaWa" right? 
[Hopping on the shameless plug bandwagon](https://soundcloud.com/humanest-humanist/sets/extrasensory-1/s-VVKt6)\n\nUnreleased so shhh, keep on the DL while I plan (but never execute) a formal release.
Hi-jacking this thread because a piece of music I made quotes the thing you're paraphrasing, I think. Unreleased, private link [here](https://soundcloud.com/humanest-humanist/sets/extrasensory-1/s-VVKt6)\n\nIt's track 4, "Last Words of a Dying Ego"\n\n/shamelessplug\n\nEdit: format
Fuck, I have a good one, but probably too late for visibility. One time I accidentally discovered a recording of my dad, on the phone with the husband of a women he was having an affair with. The husband is pressuring my dad about what went on between them. At one point he says: "You took my wife out? You made out with my wife? *How's my dick and my cum taste?*" and my dad without skipping a beat replies "pretty good."\n\nNow I don't condone what he was doing, but I kinda wanna give him a high five for the snide comeback. But I can't tell him I found the tape...
Wait, was it ever stylised that way? Didn't see any in my image search

Some new terms I like: Michael Rifle + Vorassist\n\nAlso I can't say why really, but I've always been a Neuvy guy. He and Mase are streaky on the whole but some part of me really wants Neuvy in the net. Yall can laugh at me or praise me later.
Everyone seems to be agreeing, and while ice may have been a part, it looked to me like when he went to the backhand, his stick came down too early, clipping the edge of the puck causing it to flip on edge. As in, had he lifted his sick a bit higher before the backhand the puck may not have skipped over on him.
Thanks! 
Just curious, why such a long station? My RCT2 Karts seem to cap at 9 cars, unless maybe I'm doing something wrong. 
Okay, I thought I was making them large enough to house more than 9, but I guess I'll need more. 
I was half joking here. Just pointing out that the other person's ad hominem is sort of irrelevant if you were the first to go there. 
Yeah, as a musician, it definitely seems like they didn't create, but influenced the music based on set parameters. Not quite sure what's going on. 
To the same end, INTPs can definitely engage in art on an emotional level. My music is definitely more than just playing with patterns. 
Well that's a horse of a different color.\n\nAnimals
Came looking for this comment. I'm all for mindfulness, but terms like "disrespectful" raise more questions than they answer.
Nobody seems to be pointing out that Portal 2 is some time in the future, likely after the main events of Half-Life 2 and on. When Chell leaves there's no knowing whether or not there even is a resistance anywhere or not. 
Which stream? 
Woo me too let's gooooooooo
I'm going with there being a lot of cum, not still coming. Drowning herself could just imply some sort of cum play with the amount she had. Or since it's fantasy, maybe the author did imagine a literal hose of cum. What a cumnundrum.
My INTJ friend could not give less of a shit.
I don't remember seeing a connecting door. Maybe only some of them? 
I mean it fucks my... perception. So sometimes yes? But that doesn't always strike me. 
Did you make this?
Nice
I'm also in a weird state where I feel I've learned about myself a lot through MBTI, and feel like there's some sort of validity to be had because of it. But I can't for the life of me explain it properly to other people so I've stopped trying. The battle to justify it rages on. Funny, because my desire to come to the truth on this is seemingly indicative of my Ti tendencies, thus confirming the apparent validity. Idk, who knows anything amirite?
Sick reference
Well, I'm tripping.
Interesting. I'm more proud of the latter half, so it's cool to see the former get some love. Thanks.
I'd imagine you'd be stumbling around after chugging a whole beer
Once at a charmander nest (before the starter event) I got enough candies for my first charizard and quickly after hatched an aerodactyl. Once the hatching scene ended I saw a lapras shadow nearby and caught it (ice shard/blizzard). Never had that many good pokemon in such a short time span.   
There is a clause in everyone's insurance policy with regards to complying with their investigation. If someone is refusing to comply then they could deny or strip coverage to the minimum. \n\nHowever, it does not seem to be the case with this. Even without the other party cooperating, liability can be determined using photos of the vehicles (or just yours) plus a police report. \n\nYou may need to start the claim on behalf of the other person's policy to get the ball rolling. \nUsually, both parties report a claim with their carrier and NOT the claim reps - it is very rare for a rep to report in a claim since we have too many claims to handle 
Been waiting for a lickitung for some time now....
I feel you man. I just caught my first ever lapras today using the tracker. 
Worth about $40
Don't forget lickitung. Still trying to hatch that bugger...
Northern Boston Massachusetts about $30-40 a week depending if I need to restock on stuff.
Last one sold online for $80
Is...is that Jude Law?
I moved here for work right out of college from Western Massachusetts. It is a culture shock and I am still adjusting after living here for about a year and a half. People are not friendly here compared to back home (or in your case NC) as they seem to feel some sort of entitlement or just don't care about others. I know it is a generalization and working in customer service doesn't help it. Since I've moved here, I've made work friends but other than that no one. I did rescue a few cats though and I take care of several strays now to keep from being lonely. \n\nLong story short, I'm moving off the island next year when I'm able to transfer my job to another office. It's not worth the stress, taxes and the lack of quality of life here. I hope you have a better outcome here than I did. 
Yeah I'm in Mass and I've only seen it once during the summer. It fled after one ball. I figured hatching would be easier but so far no luck. 
This happens a lot on Long Island. Most renters would have cats and never get them fixed. Then something happens where they have to move and most apartments on the Island do not allow pets at all...So then it becomes the question do you become homeless or move without your pet. So then end up leaving their unfixed pet behind and within a half year there is a new cat colony. \n\nThis is how I got my two cats. \nOn the Island they are considered wildlife so there isn't a lot of effort to help control the cat population. 
I hatched 3 2km eggs back to back....each one had a weedle..I have not hatched a starter since the Halloween event. 
If you are injured, you have $50,000 in medical coverage under personal injury protection (PIP) in New York. \n\nFor damage to your vehicle, you may need to bring it up in small claims court. 
I wouldn't recommend Erie, they like to deny claims.
Claims adjuster here. Try shopping around for insurance. I would also recommend getting a device for your car to lower your rate based on driving habits.  Your coverage limits are fine and should cover most, if not all, accidents. If possible, also get rental coverage and towing added to your policy. You'll thank me when you need it. 
Car insurance adjuster here, we know when we see these BS claims and won't offer much (maybe $500 and we won't accept most of your medical bills for such a low impact loss). In addition, your name then is put on a list for doing these kinds of claims so if you are in another accident in the near future, your claim would be referred over to our investigations unit for fraud. 
ebay  - if posted you can get around $30-50 + shipping for this item. \nThere are others listed for more but none of those are selling for that price. 
As a liability claims adjuster I cannot stress the importance of having adequate coverage along with rental for your auto policy. In my state underinsured/uninsured coverage is required under all policies written and usually your liability limits for bodily injury are the same as this. \n
Is it a large insurance company or a smaller one? I deal with multiple insurance companies on a daily basis and some are a lot worse than others on getting back to people. \nGranted, most of the time the adjuster is flooded with calls and is constantly putting out fires so things do fall at the waist side. Most likely they are still trying to finalize liability on their end. \nObviously to you it appears clear cut she is a fault, however, an adjuster needs actual evidence in their file to make any sort of decision. Because if they are to pay out anything with the company's money they need x,y, and z why they are paying such.  Evidence can be in forms of a police report (it could take a while to come in for 3rd parties), a statement from both you and their policyholder and vehicle damage photos. \nNow if they can't speak to their policyholder because of the DUI charge/they are fighting the charge in court, it can cause delay so they would need the other evidence to finalize anything.\nI would recommend to keep calling, either your adjuster or just the call center (so someone can look in the file) and ask if there is anything in the file they are waiting on that you could help expedite. By law (at least in my jurisdiction) adjusters have at least 30 days to investigate an accident so helping them work with you is the best bet. Being friendly works wonders in these situations. \n

I just bought one on ebay thats 50,000. Only cost about $12 and is the size of a phone. 
Also of note, if the dog does bite, you have every right to make a claim against her homeowner's policy for pain and suffering (especially if there is a scar/medical bills). Dog bite cases are quite common in the insurance realm. 
Have you considered buying pre-own jeans on ebay? It may be a little more than a thrift store but no traveling involved. 
This. Call them and ask if there is a non insurance price for the bill. Usually they give a 40-50% discount on the cost. Hell, they write off over 90% of a bill for medicare/medicaid. \n\n--My job requires me to look at medical bills and see who has paid them 
I don't think there is a true "0 down lease." All the ads out there that advertise it have in the fine print that it does not include taxes and fees. Be prepared to have to dish out about 2-3k for a lease. Right now 2015 leases are on sale since dealerships are making room for the 2016 models. \n\nI have a lease and it is worth not having to worry about a car not being safe/breaking down/needing repairs. \n\nedit - I had a 99 subaru forester before my lease 
Try using a toy on a string and play with her when she is hiding. \nI did this when I first got a mostly feral cat and it helped him warm up to me fast. Now he is mushy lovable lap cat.
There are some gem places but they get scooped up within minutes of being posted. The best I found is a studio in Mineola for $1,100 a month with everything included and no lease. Cats okay too. \n\nI would stay at this place if I wasn't planning to get out of NY in a few months. 
It's your lawyer's job to negotiate the medical bills down lower. Just negotiating with the insurance company is half the job. \n\nSource - I am a person a lawyer negotiates with for settlement. 
A lot of providers like to 'upcode' to get more money. Or charge $20-50 for a single hot/cold pack for you to use for 15 minutes. 
Lickitung...Walking for Alakazam, Machamp, Muk and Dragonite...\nI've hatched so many 5k eggs looking for Lickitung that it isn't even funny..
Do you have insurance on your car? I take it that the deceased's policy limits were only 25k. You may have a coverage on your own insurance policy call "underinsured/uninsured coverage" which helps you in this situation with the bills and being compensated for this loss. Check your auto policy online asap and file a claim. It may also be beneficial to obtain an attorney in this matter. 
Your parents may of had an attorney handle the affair if the accident was bad. Maybe lookup old court records with your parent's names on it and see if there is a law firm associated with it? 
Michigan right now is considered the 'wild west' with regards to auto insurance because of a lot of people taking advantage of PIP (personal injury protection). It is basically unlimited there regardless of how long after an accident...As long as you can get a doctor to say something you need is medically necessary as a result of the accident the insurance company has to comply....This includes a ramp to your house, people to come service your property, etc. 
Get renters insurance. It's about $15-20 a month but would help. \n\nMaybe a light that is motion censored? \nAn apartment security system to be installed?
Last one sold for $699.00 but since there are none listed right now on eBay, he could possibly get 1k if he has the right keywords. 
Since it is word vs word, most likely the liability would be 50/50. \n\nIf he tries to claim that he is now injured, the claim will be looked at with a fine tooth comb for fraud. \nIt happens more often than you think. 
My office has the opposite problem. Great pay, hours and benefits but the job sucks. It is a high stress job evaluating medical demand packages and negotiating with attorneys over settlement amounts. It's less than 40 hours a week but the stress gets to a lot of people. \nMy office is always hiring as a result..
You should open a credit card for your child and make a small purchase/pay in full each month to build their credit. My friend's parents did this for him and he's 23, over a 20 year credit history with perfect credit. 
Sounds like the one on the Hempstead turnpike! I wouldn't trust video game electronics at either unique unless if it can be properly tested..I saw a DS once with a pokemon game in it at a Unique for $70. Thankfully the battery was charged enough to test it and the control pad didn't work. I showed this to the guy who prices things and they wouldn't lower the price or at least put on the device that it doesn't work properly..gotta love their no refunds. 
You can add more than one vehicle (same as drivers) to one policy. 
Geico has a nasty reputation within the insurance community to deny most claims. 
How about you use 1 packet of the flavored one and then a packet of regular? 
Consult an attorney ASAP. There shouldn't be a fee for the consult--usually. \nAppears to be a malpractice lawsuit as another redditor said.

I found it on craigslist and I was the first responder to the ad. \n\nAgain, I'm moving in Janish I well where this one will be quickly grabbed again. 
Have you considered bed risers? They are about $10 and work great
That sounds wonderful. I have yet to find a nest in my state..
Well I'm moving off the island in Jan/Feb so my place out be open. No broker fee, everything included in Mineola. Studio for $1,100 a month all updated. Cats okay as well. \n\nmy landlady wanted help fill it when I do move 
Yes this and ALWAYS take photos of your car and the other person's vehicle. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if one or all try to claim injuries based on their actions at the scene...\n\n---Claims adjuster

Basically if you got into an accident caused by someone else and you're hurt, it is my job to settle the claim with you for 'pain and suffering.' I do that by getting your medical bills and records related to the accident, evaluating them and then presenting an offer based on your injuries/treatment.\n\nUsually people have attorneys in my area and I tend to just be getting the demand package/all the medical records/bills from them. Then it is a matter of coming to a settlement number. \n\nWe don't change the offer if you have an attorney or not. The attorney just tends to haggle more. 
any text on the back?
I did this last month. I use to live in a 1BR in a complex for $1502 per mth (only heat/water included) and now I live in a studio--everything included (wifi, cable, heat, electric, water, etc) for $1100 out of a residential home. \n\nHaving the extra $400+ per month is wonderful--closer to $500 with the utilities. \n\nSure it is smaller than my one bedroom but I don't have a lot of stuff and I live comfortably without excess empty space. 
Just found it! Thanks!
Can confirm, Beverly/Salem is full of Porygon. I also saw several Lickitungs last night. No Chansey. 
Your car insurance has an exclusion on using your car for a business purpose. Such as a repair truck, taxi, work vehicle, etc. If an accident happens, you may have to foot the bill yourself because of not having commercial insurance.  
If all the bills are accepted as related treatment and just speaking about the pain and suffering portion (not including the medical bills) he may be compensated between 1,000-3,000 depending on the injuries he was diagnosed with and the extent of the treatment.\n \nNo way is this worth anywhere near 10k if a claim is filed. Plus tort threshold needs to be met which  varies in each state. 
My best friend's mother use to be a nun in her youth and actually met Mother Teresa. She claims that Mother Teresa was a bitch and was one of the final factors that drove her away from being a nun and got married. 
It is a great idea to go to community college first and then transfer to a four year school. Most if not all community colleges offer grants for students which should cover the majority of the cost. Also look into your local scholarships. Some foundations who provide scholarships sometimes offer interest free loans. \nI was able to get about $10k of loans from them with no interest which is awesome. 
Again, it highly depends on the injury. Each state and even every county is different. I handled New England, NY and OH. \n\nSomeone being a single parent with a young kid is also a factor we take into account with our settlement offer. We also cover the medical bills, lost time from work, etc. With proof of course to justify the reimbursement.\n\nExample - someone having a non displaced fractured distal radius (wrist) who has a full time desk job can get about 20-30k depending if it is on their dominant hand. \nFractures (not rib, toes or fingers) are worth a decent amount of money. \n\nNow for a simple neck/back sprain/strain, emergency room visit, either seeing a chiropractor a few times or a physical therapist until feeling better can range from about 2-4k depending on your location, how long you treated (if you over treat we will not accept the treatment), if any diagnostic testing have been done, etc. --This 2-4k amount is NOT including the medical bills. Just the pain and suffering part. \n\nAlso to keep in mind---A lot of states have something called a tort threshold. It is usually a dollar amount before being eligible to make a bodily injury claim. Some states require a degree of permanency as well as a tort dollar amount to be passed.
The older ones can sell for a bit. They have been around for decades.

I lived in a ground floor apartment before. They tend to be a lot colder overall and the heating doesn't seem to circulate as well as main level apartments. \n\nThe peace of mind is worth an extra $90 AU a month. 
I've only seen one months ago which ran away after the first throw. I have been trying to hatch one since. So far no luck after a few hundred eggs. 
Which college? There are a variety there and I miss the leisurely driving. 
Any tags? How tall is it?
Try to only spend 8k TOTAL on a 3 year lease. That could be like $1500 down, 150 a month give or take. If they can't do it, walk out. They will go after you even if you are already in the parking lot. 
That's about 30 minutes from my parent's home. There are tons of nice places in that area such as Atkins farms. 
I'm a 5 min walk to the ocean and I have been going every day to find a lapras. I even went into the water searching with no luck. What do I end up finding? A fucking charmander 20 ft from shore...WTF?!
If you two are under the same household, it would save both of you money to just have 1 auto policy. She needs to be the named insured and you a listed operator on the declarations page. \n\nAlso always get rental on your policy and limits of at least 100/300k. \n\nSource- I'm a Bodily Injury Claims adjuster 
It really depends on the injury and our insured's policy limits. Other factors come into play as well like your job, age, responsibilities, hobbies and if you're married. \n\nFor example, having a broken leg from an accident would impact someone more who is married with two toddlers while having a full time job compared to someone unemployed, living at their parent's home and just stays in playing video games all day. \n\nUsually if someone has a low policy limit and the person has serious injuries, we would just offer the policy and get a release. 
They have a family medical leave option up to 13 weeks of unpaid leave. I do have the savings to help with this cost if needed. \n\nI am not sure. The initial game plan was to have my father discharged from rehab on Aug 19th and then go home this week. But once he got to my place he fell twice and then was rushed back to the hospital. \nI think the time off would help me with visiting him, checking on my brother and relaxing some..But then I feel like I am doing nothing and should be working. --I apologize, I am very scattered  right now 
They have something similar at Bubba Gump's Shrimp called "Stop Forest Stop" and "Go Forest Go"
Does the home qualify for a FHA loan?
Have you planned out the closing costs? It is usually about 5% of the gross price which is for the loan, home inspections, and other things. 
Where are you located? (State)
Dollar tree---all the toys you want there. Go to walmart for cat food/litter. 
Is the witness listed on the police report? Insurance companies would want to talk to the witness as well to confirm everything. They don't base all their decisions off police reports as they can be wrong or easily amended. 
Thanks!\n
Liability Injury claims adjuster here. We look at a lot of different aspects of the claim when determining the at fault status. \n\nMost claims--if not a rear end accident are NOT 100% at fault. \n\nWe look at a lot of different aspects such as:\n*Police report\n*Scene photos\n*Statements (from both parties, witnesses)--We also address the credibility of the statement as well\n*Possible video footage\n*Vehicle damage photos (Did you hit their front door or closer to their end?)\n*where in the intersection did the accident take place? any lanes crossed? traffic? \n\nWe also address what duties each driver has and which ones were breached. A few would be proper lookout, last clear chance, any evasive actions done and yielding to oncoming traffic. \n\nWith regards to the police report--the police are writing it after the fact, they were not there. At least in my jurisdiction, the police report is not admissible in the courts. It is the the police officer making a report based off of what both you and the other driver told them. They can also be easily amended. \n\n\nNow an adjuster looks at ALL of these pieces when making their decision. They don't cherry pick. \n\nAlso us adjusters were NOT there at the accident so we have to put the pieces together the best we can. If we don't have clear evidence that points one way or another (word vs word, PR and photos don't help) we usually do 50/50. \n\nMost likely with regards to your case, without having the specifics, the adjuster has a liability RANGE. So it is 30%. It could be 20-30% but we work with a range--at least my company does since our accessment can change with new information being presented. \n\nIn this case, just go through your insurance company if you have collision coverage. You will may have to pay your deductible but if your insurance company agrees that the other car is MAJORITY at fault, it may be waived. \n\nMy advice-get a dashcam. Best investment for your money.  
Anyone heard about the Western New Mexico online MBA? It seems pretty cheap but I have no idea on the program itself\n\nhttp://admissions.wnmu.edu/calc/

Optimum is great. No contract for just internet and it was $55/mth plus all the hotspots. 
Utilize your local library. They have tons of movies you can rent out for free. Cable isn't really needed anymore. Just get good wifi for streaming. \n\nMake sure you also unplug almost everything after you use it to save a few dollars. 
Can confirm. I work for an insurance company in claims and there are a lot of former law enforcement people here as well as former personal injury attorneys. 
Are you injured from the accident?\n\nIf so, your insurance company in some states either has PIP (personal injury protection coverage) or medical payments coverage (optional) available. This would cover your medical expenses, co-pays and sometimes lost wages. 
A 1 bedroom in a complex can be upwards of $1500 a month in Nassau. 
Have you considered an antique ring? \n\nSure it's not new but it would only cost a few hundred at most and look timeless. \n\nI would try eBay
But...but... guns are banned in Britain. If you ban things they go away forever.
Not that I'm trying to excuse any of what has happened to you, but knowing a lot of Mexican Americans in particular, I know that "chinga" is their slang word for the phrases "aw fuck!" or "you fuck!". So that one may or may not be racially motivated depending on the context. 
File a claim with the other person's insurance company. \n\nNo fault only refers to personal injury protection benefits for the policy owner's vehicle. Meaning if the driver of the at fault vehicle was injured, their auto policy is primary to pay the medical bills. \n\nOnce liability is determined by the at fault insurance carrier, then you can file 3rd party to get your vehicle repaired (or compensated if a total loss) and a rental vehicle. \n\nIf injured, you can file a bodily injury claim if you meet tort threshold for the state. \n\nThe only thing that may go against you here is late reporting of the accident to the other insurance company and the time it will take them to investigate the loss. \n--Investigations usually consist of photos of each car if available, statements, a police report and a scene photo. These investigations usually last about 30 days but it all depends on how fast they are provided all of the information. \n\n--I'm an insurance bodily injury adjuster.

I'm saying it's ok for individual citizens and residents to own condominiums. I'm saying it's ok for a retiree to have a portfolio of 2, 5, 20 etc condominiums. I think it's even ok for a local entrepreneur to own an entire apartment building to rent out as a business model. I don't think it's wise to up end the idea that there will always be a need for temporary housing. I'm just saying that huge capital inflows overseas have been badly distorting housing markets in prime areas all over the world. There needs to be a paradigm shift where living space is primarily a good to be consumed, like a utility, rather than an investment vehicle. Kill overseas speculation, severely penalize with taxes those who wait and hold domestically and make living near job providing areas viable for the majority of the populace again.
How have I not seen this sooner? Does anyone have the link to the original post? 
This makes me sad, there was a time not too long ago where people viewed themselves as being lucky for being born in the USA. I have a lot of compatriots who now lament the fact they weren't born overseas because of situations like yourself, here they never even had a chance. Good on you for using the helping hand to progress.
This demographic craves their 2 minutes of hate, like /u/exdeath1987 said. He's just pandering to what sells- it's class warfare disguised as a generation v. generation. Where he's working, what kind of Millenials do you think they're hiring? The veterans of the recent wars they shower praise on, the young apprentices trying to get into blue collar trades, or the roughnecks from Texas and North Dakota? Of course not. It's their own children, grown fat from a soft life they themselves guaranteed. They hate on them because they are a reflection of the previous generations elite's shortcomings.
Hiking. I live 800 miles from the nearest mountains, and it's almost always 85+ degrees where I'm at. If I'm lucky, I can hike once a year. 
Can there be a win-win? It sounds like a fantastic time to up our strategic oil reserves, and it'd be a good way to prop up domestic producers until the market settles again. 
What's a Q ball?
Look, I'm from Miami. So compared to me, you're a damned PhD in back country exploring. I got an itch to see the remote Rockies last year, but knew a total of 0 about being in an Alpine wilderness area. Did a little homework and stumbled across these guys: http://sanjuanhuts.com/index.php/hike/hiking-hut (I'm on mobile, sorry for the ugly linking). I had a backpack, some food and a water purifier and that's about it. I didn't have to worry about permits, tents, etc. Still saw some of the prettiest and most remote terrain the west had, and learned a LOT about being in that environment. For example, I did not know that, although it's OK to hike without a hiking permit, if I needed to get rescued, it would be on my dime (hiking with people who know what they're actually doing helps! ). Just a ton of little things like that. I took way too much food, took too much bug repellent  (Miami bugs way more aggressive than Colorado, but how are they supposed to know that? ), etc, etc. It was a great 5 day hike, picked up a lot of knowledge, and the most expensive part about the whole thing was getting there. 
Precisely- which begs the question- why are there any private schools at all?
I'm fascinated though, I mean Cuba to the USA is a much much smaller jump than Cuba to Greece. I've heard of Cubans flying to Central Asia (I believe Kazakhstan if memory serves me correctly- since it's one of the few countries that Cubans may travel to visa free)- did they tell you what their motivations are? Why the EU vs the USA? The risk to benefit ratio seems very skewed from my point of view.
Lol this would be a steal in some American cities too
Assuming this is every penny to your name, I would suggest deducting what you would need for 4-6 months living expenses, and submit the rest to the altar of student loans. If you have good cash flow and are absolutely secure in your job/business, I don't see any downside out of knocking the hell out of your student loans.
Lol, I think Hawaii is actually a white minority state, IIRC
Without Farage the leave campaign would have made 20% vote max. It was his baby and he drove it home.
Yeah, I get where you're coming from, but I decided against solo camping since I'm so green to the whole thing. It took me a week to acclimate to the altitude  (started in Denver and road tripped it to the San Juans during the course of that time), altitude sickness hit me real bad once I got above 7000 feet, because where I live is only a whopping 4 feet above sea level. Glad I took the time to adjust. After speaking with other hikers, I begrudgingly agreed to buy hiking pants instead of jeans and boy was that a good call. If I had gone in jeans, I wouldn't have been able to scramble over rocks and fallen trees. My girlfriend got really sick during the hike, and some other hikers suspected she was having issues with electrolytes (I thought that was silly, I ran track in high school, I knew that if you had a regular diet and didn't over exert yourself, you're good to go unless you're doing something extreme like running 1600 meters in 90 degree weather. I didn't take into account how finicky she is in her diet, and the fact she has never done any sort of endurance  sport before, so a 32 mile hike was going to be extreme for her. ), lo and behold they gave her some powdered electrolytes and an Emergen-C packet and she literally went from a light shade of green and drowsy to pink and alert. Pop tarts and snickers bars were great for pick-me-ups, and at least in the San Juans, water is every where, so I was over worried and carried WAY too much water back country. It was great just for the learning curb alone, not to mention it's genuinely one of the prettiest places in the country.

No that'd be ridiculous. I think it's ok if small individual domestic investors have a couple of apartments to rent, that seems like it'd be a nice nest egg for people to have for retirement. I see no advantage to huge firms or foreign investors who can, by virtue of scales of economy, can sit by and let perfectly good housing go unused. This applies to houses as well. After the crash, all the large investors swooped in during the fire sale and have a stranglehold on prime real estate in the United States, at the expense of everyday Americans.

That's because it is a regression
To be frank, to most gun owners, concealed carry not being permitted is considered an *effective* ban on guns. It's akin to being permitted to own a vehicle, but being impossible to get a drivers license. Yes, strictly speaking, you can move the car around (put it in neutral and push, tow it around with professional assistance, etc) but it really defeats the point of owning one. This is why most Americans say owning guns are banned in places like NYC and Boston, when, strictly speaking, it isn't. Canada has quite a few shotguns and manual-action rifles as well, but it isn't generally considered a gun friendly place- Britain considerably less so.\n\nMost licensing requirements are politically motivated as well, we see this throughout the United States in shall issue vs may issue jurisdictions. This is seen as a hair breadth's away from an *effective* ban as well- as the local political structure may pressure the licensing authorities to issue virtually no licenses. Yes, I understand, as a rule of thumb, that most countries permit firearms for hunting and sporting purposes- but for personal defense and as a right? The United States of America is alone in that regard- though the founding fathers admittedly could have done a better job writing out that Second Amendment to clarify their position:\n\n "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."\n\nNow, this can be interpreted a million ways, but I doubt anyone has seriously argued that this text meant "You have the right to keep firearms only for sporting and hunting purposes, as well as for killing varmint". Most gun owners, myself included, generally interpret it as meaning the ability to lawfully carry firearms shouldn't be infringed. Nothing about the ammo, shooting rate, etc. If you're a law-abiding member of society- feel free to own the tools you deem necessary for defense and utilitarian purposes.

I'd be relieved too if I knew I just got away from being in the middle of a bare-knuckle brawl between two UFC fighters.
Those firms large or small looking to turn a profit off of sales alone. Since foreign venture capital won't be distorting the market with sit and hold speculation, there will probably be an incentive to sell quicker than in the current market conditions.
Oh don't worry guys, the economy is booming! Haven't you seen the stock market? It's on a forever upward runaway! Buy buy buy!

Oh, sorry, I'm misinformed. Where can I apply for a concealed weapons permit in Britain? Once I have the permit, I'd love to buy a hand gun and AR-15, though I'd settle for an Eastern European semi automatic rifle as well. Where could I buy one there? 
Wait until the Poles aggressively take over a border radio station, the Germans will have to defend themselves then.
As a business owner, I second your comment. I love my friends and family to death, but not all of them have the appropriate support mechanisms to start up or handle the various ups and downs of a business. They're bright and motivated- but poverty of either resources or time seems to be the limiting factor in whether or not someone who wants to start a business can successfully. Then, of course there are those who simply don't want to start or run a business- and there is nothing wrong with that. I look around and I see all the work that could be done (infrastructure problems, the education system needs reform, etcetera etcetera- BIG problems that will need armies of people to fix), I see all these motivated well-educated people who want a crack at a decent life, and I ask myself, where is the disconnect? Why can't we put two and two together?

Back in my day, you had to pay out of pocket for healthcare AND education. Hell, a visit to the doctor could bankrupt you, and you had to take out a LOAN for school after high school.  And hell, it was more expensive than the itty-bitty additional tax we pay now for those things.

Next crash, just let the chips fall where they may. Also, ban institutional investment in residential properties and make sure that people who purchase property in the United States are at least permanent residents (residences are meant to be lived in, not a safe parking spot for ill gotten gains from overseas). Bam, just took care of about 75% of the next property bubble.
You're absolutely right about Islam, the issue is it takes Islamic radicals a lot of effort to do small level attacks, if a Sarah Palin-esque figure ever seized control of the executive branch, she could drag down the whole world in a hurry. Yes, Islam is scary, but they're weaker (logistically, technologically, materially, etc), they're over 'there' for the most part. Christians are here, are a political force to be reckoned with and actively preach a belief about how hastening the end times will bring about a second coming of their messiah. 
This guy has brass balls to be traveling in Venezuela at this time of crisis. 
I'd imagine there would be a tremendous amount of higher end apartments being sold in a firesale if we put in some serious taxation for vacant units. A lot of cities have rows and rows of apartment buildings sitting virtually empty as investment properties, it will help to mitigate the shortage of affordable housing in the near to mid-term. In the future, I'd imagine investors should be able to gather together and build housing, just not hold it ad infinitum as a form of speculation or rent seeking. Build and sell, like the old days. It'll help bring costs way down.

I'm speciesist, I hope humans survive. That being said, everywhere that humans have been made absent has experienced a pretty robust ecological bounce back. Clearly extinct species won't come back, but the environment as a whole seems pretty robust when you eliminate human beings from the equation.

Holy fuck. This needs to be an imgur image that I can email to friends overseas to explain to them what American healthcare is actually like.
Ok thank you all for the pointers, I'll need to take a hard look at Brother
Woah ESI of 1
Ironically, one of the reasons I don't ski more (to be frank, only been once) is that the risk of injury is moderately high. It's not the injury that will set me back though (my job is primarily intellectual), but the outrageous cost of whatever injury is possible, even with insurance. I'm not going to gamble $6K at a minimum for an adrenaline rush.
Wait until the big one
That is far far below the cost of a 1 bedroom in any city center in the United States with a comparable quality of life to a European city. I pay this much (since €=$ at the moment) for a 1 bedroom on the outskirts of a major American city. Healthcare with a $6000 deductible is about $250/month, although that is after subsidies. It would be closer to $500 without it. I just paid off my last student loans last month, spent about $33k to pay them off in total. Dividing that by 5 years (60 months), it works out to a total of $550 a month. I got off light, started my own business, and have a much higher quality of life than most of my fellow STEM cohort I graduated with. Did I mention nonexistent public transportation? Add vehicle payments and insurance payments to that mix as well, not to mention about $75 a month in tolls (surface streets are congested to the point my business would be defunct without expressways). $50k doesn't buy much here, I promise you.
I shouldn't have forgotten the /s. \n[Case and point.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush#Education)
Ironically, the only people I know that have paid off their student loans are the ones who started businesses after college (usually having nothing to do with the degree they earned). I did STEM, saw the job market was a joke, and with student debt was once bitten twice shy. I figured there was no point in hunting down a masters if it'll double my debt and give me a 20% better paying entry level job. Once I saw the herds moving in that direction, I took what personal savings I had (plus credit cards) and started a little business. I won't give specifics (because it's a very unique business, and makes me almost immediately identifiable with minimal googling)- but it's somewhere on the prestige scale between gardner and party clown to give you an idea. I could sacrfice my financial future for a job I though I deserved, or write off my academic training as a sunken cost. By the way guys, listen to /u/daiyuesen , he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately,  /u/jkid is correct as well, I didn't take any money from my parents, but living with them in the years immediately after college gave me options my friends with less supportive parents simply couldn't access. I feel bad that the United States is taking talented people, and forcing them to think small for their immediate survival, rather than betting big and risking failure. It'll be a rude awakening in the decades to come when other aspects of our national supremacy are eclipsed by foreign powers (we've already been surpassed on so many). Ours will be the generation of little ventured, little gained. 
Portishead!

Well, he has 40 odd years on me in age personally, so there's time yet. Admittedly, I am nowhere near as 'connected' as he was at this age. I'm doing alright though, no DUI at this stage. I hope neither one of us ever wrecks the trajectory of a world power and triggers a large regional war. Failing to do either of those things would certainly make our lives more helpful to the human race in the grand scheme of things compared to that level of erroneous judgement.
Well, those condos are sitting empty for the most part- they were built to cater to high-end employees who have plenty of cash to spend on renting. If institutions and foreign investors had to divest themselves in a hurry, preferably in unison, I'd imagine it'd bring real estate prices in job-rich areas down. Seems like a win-win for the majority of the populace.

Look, I know socialized reading works in other countries, but it just won't happen here. The cost of educating our writers forces our best authors to get the highest publishing advances, period. Plus, look at all the foreign authors who come to take the American market by storm- they're banging at the doors to be let into our market. You have to remember it's not FREE, someone is paying for all these "free" books, and its your taxes! No free lunch, plus if you let people read and learn for free they'll simply abuse the system. They'll go to the library to socialize with peers, or for minor knowledge seeking trips rather than bona fide knowledge crises. If you make people pay for reading, they'll actually use books in the most effecient matter possible, saving everyone lots of money. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the price increases in books, but hey, do you know how much research it takes to get a SINGLE science book from brain to bookshelf? I'm talking years!

Lol, this is illegal as hell. You can ban outright political expressions as a matter of neighborhood appearance, but you can't have a pick and choose of ideology. Imagine if they don't permit a menorah display but only Christian crosses for the "good of the neighborhood". They'd be laughed out of court. 
Their country their rules- it's why we in the secular west should never give even an iota of political power or special protections to religious ideals. You may practice your faith within the limits of secular law, but you may not demand that your faith not be ridiculed. Remember, bad ideas are easily killed with laughter.
No dishonesty, the majority of makes and models of guns are in fact banned there. Those guns that aren't banned, you're not able to carry with you for the most part. Hell, most of your police can't carry a firearm.  Britain has, effectively, banned guns.

I understand in theory why school choice seems like a good idea, but in the long run it's like giving parents the choice of whether or not to vaccinate their child- it doesn't work out in the long run for society as a whole. Plus, if everyone's kids were required to go to a public school, the influential would care a hell of a lot more about the quality of said schools, rather than bubbling themselves away from problems their economic choices have largely caused.

I am very sorry for your loss /u/mykhathasnotail \n\nFirst of all, put all notions of thinking you were in any way responsible for this out of your mind. This is not an issue of kharma- this is a matter of change, the root of much of our suffering in life. Clearly, this is a huge change, unwarranted and undeserved. You will hurt from this, and you yourself will change because of it.\n\nUltimately, you need to grieve, you are only human. Right now the shock is numbing, but the pain will come (if it hasn't already). Time will be the only means for you to heal- it will be a scar, and like all scars, the pain never truly goes away if you focus on it, but eventually, with healing, it fades into the background. \n\nYou don't need to forget about him, that would be forced and contrived. You need to understand that all joy is temporary, and that includes the wonderful people in your life. It doesn't make their lives worth any less, quite the contrary, it makes them that much more valuable. The ones we love are a precious and rare resource from which we draw much of our strength. \n\nAs for helping him- what did he want? Was he kind in word and actions to you? Did he help you on your path? If so, he clearly wanted you to be well, to grow, to be happy. You can only help in these goals set by him by helping yourself.  
It's really not, Trump is a moron but the democrats near ignored lower working class Americans for a long time and Hillary wouldn't have done much for them. At least Trump talked about them, hell he killed TPP.\n\nThat said and done...fark.... Should have been Bernie. 
People look at me like I'm insane when I basically use this argument, but I believe it wholeheartedly. I imagine America is like a well. Right now only the wealthy and powerful are permitted to drink enough from the well to sustain themselves. Sanders is the reasonable man who will see to it that everyone gets enough to drink. Trump is the madman who will poison the well so that everyone suffers together. If the majority of the people will go thirsty (which is frankly what would happen under a Clinton administration) would they not vote to spite the establishment, if their own best interest won't even be represented on the ballot?
Yes, firing him was god awful stupid

#riggeddnc, you can't fuck over a candidate then be mad/surprised at his supporters for not voting Hillary.
This is why you roll alliance. Best pve racials and in pvp you get insta queue.
Progression of the human race? We have more collective power together i.e. we can take care of ourselves just fine but all of us working together could do it a bit better.
He is in DNC running so he is relevant. He might drop Ellison to the left more.
So glad we got rid of him...
He is there, just because he doesn't have a good chance of winning doesn't mean he can't do some good, just look at Bernie. No chance --> Inspiration. 
Congratulations, where's that?
We in Europe are just fine without the USA.
My best bit advice for you is find a guide. Follow it to the tee without changing anything and it will streamline your first experience. Once you have enjoyed the game you will start to crave additional things and then you can delve into this world of infinite builds and ideas.
That is his point though, he is telling people to stop complaining and enjoy it.
Did you roll horde because you want people to win BG's for you? I can win them quite comfortably.
stress, lack of income, lack of education. Fix those three for future generations and your country will be fine.
That only worked because the same people paying the Rep pay checks pay the Dem's. Get the money out of politics and you will see Dem's actually use their backbone.
is everyone offline from Elysium or just us that got booted and can't get back in?
That's it man. You could be a normal everyday guy and then your lovely family gets bombed for nothing... can you blame someone in that situation for drinking the crazy coolade?
But Obama's administration was great a bombing and killing civillians with drones, so then why is Trump doing it? anyway point being that the title should have said "Donald Trump's staff get him to agree on some policies by saying 'Obama wouldn't have done it'". 
No it's just rape
As a non American I'm beginning to stop laughing and starting to get angry. If you guys don't get rid of him the rest of us are goin to start treating you with such contempt. 
Officially he was NOT a nobody, he was officially the leader of UKIP, the political party in the UK whose sole mandate was to get the UK out of the EU. He's also one of the UK's representatives in the EU. He was there every step of the way campaigning and being on TV and radio. He sure as hell had a lot to do with decision making and how things went about.\n\nSo no, with all due respect that's bullshit.
For sure mate. I hope you guys find that good balace between being strong and being humble.\n\nPerfect example is climate change. Make it abruptly clean in interviews, town halls etc any time someone tries to BS that the science is out that they are either lieing or misinformed. Don't let up till they shut up.   
I have one, and I clean it with a dishwashing brush right after fermentation with some hot water, then sanitise with Star San. I thought the plastic would be fine using the brush, am I wrong?
So mine is on channel 1-4 along with a distant neighbour, should I look to change it?
No it's not... Fuck me.

Does this mean that it would ok for sane Americans to discriminate against people who believe in the word of all holy books, or was it just one of them?

Furing Di Matteo was a big mistake, so many of our draws were wins bottled in the last 10m. He needed time to build confidence. 
Bs asise, why? What do you know that others could be enlightened by learning?
he doesn't have a good chance means that he is probably at a sub 1% chance
Knowing it's a lie and not clearing it up makes him culpable. Being wilfully ignorant of that sets a very dangerous precedent for the future of politics in the UK.\n\nIt is his responsibility to deny it. He is the leader of UKIP, he was the no.1 go to guy for news and media interviews about the leave campaign. Of course he didn't for the reasons you say, but it's the UK peoples job to make him see repercussions for that disingenuous action, if they don't it sets a terrible precedent for the future.
Well I've played up to that point, on multiple characters.
Anecdotal I know but I've used G2A a lot to buy game keys. Usually they are just bought from countries where they are cheaper from. Just my experience with them I wanted to share. 
I'm really casual on everything so don't look to me for guidance on efficiency/excellence. I just sometimes feel like eating an orange or a banana and feel that I would rather eat those when being relaxed on my diet rather than digging into a bar of chocolate.
Nice
no it's not, I just opened it and it worked?
Something that your stats do not consider. How many of those innings were there that he came in when there were only a few overs left or that we were greatly behind in a run rate. In both instances he can't get a high score, he just has to hit it hard and go for a high strikerate. Average is not everything for a lower order batsman.
I swapped Giroud for Lukaku and captained him... nah I didn't I changed my mind on that and then put in Crouch and made Erikson captain. FUCK!!!
I really don't like her as an actress either. She is one of my top low points in GOT. 
That's a really complicated question. If we stayed allies but you left I'd say as a basic answer yes.
Semi relevant/related, in New Zealand under age people are allowed to drink in restaurants if their parents buy it for them, but not allowed to buy it themselves. 
Yes he is culpable. He knew the figure/false fact to not be true and used the benefit of it existing to sell his product. The media he talked to based conversations around that point and he didn't contest it once.
The game is casual at very best, trying to masquerade as competitive.
I think the point is that you should be making plans to eat drink and fuck instead. 
Armerica can you please settle the fuck down. The extremist Islamist world happens to be completely ignorant, they paint the rest of the white western world with the same brush as you.\n\nBombing terrorists is like going after hydra, kill one, you make two more. You need to educate their societies/increase their access to information.
'Your people'... I'm not American, and it's not outrageous. If you pay attention to US politics you can additionally see how their whole political system is a shambles and that loyalty to the party candidate vs the enemy party is very strong.
Don't be the friend zone, be the N zone, double down! In this situation you have to just straight up say "I don't wanna be your man, I wanna be yo nigga" - 2Pac.

Thanks very much 
This isn't reddit it's life. Our levels of communication have just increased so much we more often hear classics repeated.
Nice conversation we got going here, mean that sincerely.\n\nI too think she would have been better than Trump. I am of the opinion, from what I've seen from US and local media, that Trump spent a far greater time telling people there was a problem. Hillary was saying she could make their lives better, but isn't that what every candidate says, and to these struggling families that voted Trump they might have heard that line one too many times. Hearing someone talk about the state of politics and corruption, how it has influenced their lives, and how he wanted to change that (for the first time in a long while it must be said) is more resonating.\n\nWhat do you think about that? Such a shame Trump said about all of that and then ripped his middle finger to everyone after.
Harden up.
Thanks mate
All good, happy travels 😃
A common mistake is people calling a strained ankle a sprained ankle. If you know the difference you know a sprained ankle needs attention and you need crutches most of the time.
You sound mad that you didn't get here first to post it.\n
I think his point was pretty fucking clear. Obama killed her brother, Trump killed her. War is bad and bombing people will not stop the breeding of terrorists.\n\nYou know that, I think he just wants to make sure others are not forgetting both the left and the right in the USA love the military machine and all the glorious profits it reaps them.
I think the point of it is if someone is sick and comes to hospital they will get treatment. If they happen to be illegal then after the fact I'd hope that the hospital would push them to register and start paying taxes etc.
but if he is going at it as hard as possible to boost our scores a little higher then his average isn't going to be higher because he will get out more often playing riskier shots.

Imo ask for a promotion and a big pay restructure. Your boss doing nothing isn't a problem, you not getting adequately paid for doing everything is. Tell him you are comfortable and enjoy the work but are not being paid adequately.

I think a judge would have to rule that the bet offered was not relevant to the outcome of the game and that the player performing either action was an act of free will and not related to the game. With that in mind there is no foul play here.\n\nThe betting sites have to take responsibility for taking bets on black and white options. If they made a bet that said his boots would be black we would just laugh at them for losing money.
Keto flu only happens when you are malnourished ie need more calories, but specifically electrolytes. Focus more on making sure you have enough, also if you are training that much you could eat up to 100g carbs and be fine. I eat 50 or under and on workout days a little more, I get most of my carbs from fruit n vegetables though not chips n lollies.
Your example ignores the fact that the wall building in of itself is a gigantic undertaking that will create jobs and investment in the communities.

He didn't do anything wrong, he shared his views. His views are incompatible with our modern world.

No it doesn't. This is not up for discussion either.\n\nBacardi white, Havana Club white (standard white rum) has 0 sugar in it.\n\nCaptain Morgan Spice Gold for example has sugar in it because it was added post fermentation as a flavour additive.
With the greatest of respect as an outsider and not a fan of Trump I kind of see his point. America was founded on genocide against the local population, and the USA also instituted the worst case of slavery the world has ever seen. Since then the USA has been involved in a lot of foreign government overthrows for profit/US safety and in numerous wars they have had no need to be in. So yeah the 'USA' as a whole has been pretty god damn awful.
There is a distinction though. As a man if I said to a lady, "hey I'd like to take you out to dinner" then I expect to pay, if I said "shall we have dinner together sometime" then I expect we'd share.

This was probably around when the iphone 3 was new, and before I had a phone that was any good at browsing the web. I was talking to a female coworker about something, and wanted to show her what I was talking about so I asked to borrow her iphone to look it up. Open up the browser to google and start typing, the first suggestion to come up was "gay bear porn". I glanced up at her and she was definitely watching me closely, like she was afraid something scandalous might come up. I didn't say anything and just continued my search. The kicker is her brother is an openly gay man and she talks about it. Could've been just a random suggestion to pop up on google, doubt it, or maybe her brother used her phone to watch a little porn. Idk, but I never mentioned it to her.

I'm calm because a long time ago I realized that there are very, very few things that actually matter.

Did anyone else preorder the Sona Connected Bracelet from Caeden and have yet to receive it? I ordered mine in April and knew it would be a couple months to receive the product. Got an email saying they'd be shipped in June. Then it was delayed to August, and then November, and I still haven't received it. I've emailed them 3 times and only got one response asking for my order number, which I then sent them. I haven't heard from them since, and that was about a month and a half ago. They also sent an email saying they'd be giving everyone who preordered a $25 refund, and I've never gotten that either. Any advice would help!

I have been. Trump and the King of Saudi Arabia agreed to support safe zones in Syria and Yemen for refugess displaced by war in those countries. But how again does this stop extremists from Saudi Arabia from coming to the US and causing carnage on a level like, say, 9/11, which was committed by a majority of Saudis? Also, I'm not sure if you were one of those people who thought Obama was a Muslim or not, but if you are one of those, then wouldn't you think SA would have gladly done whatever Obama wanted? Isn't that what the Muslim brotherhood is all about?\n\nEdit: I am actually glad you are here discussing things. I once tried to bring up a small bit of rationality over in T_D and was immediately banned. Quite the safe space they have over there.\n\nEdit #2: Entering the US as a refugee is already nearly impossible and It's far easier to get here just as a regular traveler. So what's to stop terrorists from just coming here by way of SA? that's all I've got for now.

Thanks for all the recipe ideas! Tonight I put a couple chicken breasts in the crock pot with some corn and adobo, plus a few other spices so my wife can make quesadillas for her and the baby the rest of the week. Chicken tastes great. My mom used to make porcupine balls when I was younger, I loved those. Good suggestions. We have scrambled eggs every morning, and sometimes I just want to make em for dinner too when I'm feeling lazy or we're low on other stuff but I want the baby to get something different for each meal. I would also like to add that I recently saw a recipe shared on FB that was just a banana and two eggs, mashed and mixed up, and made like banana pancake type things, can't wait to make those. Eggs and bananas are cheap and we always have a lot of both.
thank you. also, i'm a huge vonnegut fan, this must be fate. so it goes.

As I said, don't tell your parents you had an abortion, tell them you had a miscarriage from all the stress of the situation. You won't be lying, you're telling a half truth at worse. Miscarriages are a lay term, medically speaking they are "Spontaneous abortions." So look at it like this, you got spontaneously pregnant, and had an abortion. Remove 4 words between that and you get the medical term.

agreed 100%, its such a waste on our resources to persecute weed useage.\n\nWeed was decriminalized to an infraction in 2013 for under an ounce, much like a speeding ticket. In 2016 we voted to allow the sale recreationally, and immediately owning it was now legal. It has not yet been given the green light to sell for non medical purposes, but it will soon. I think beginning of next year.

A rant, no, that wasnt a rant. It was a refuting of your interpretation of the words vs what I see. \n\nSee, the constitution is interpreted every time the SCOUTS takes a case. They have to "read between the lines" from what the founders meant. If it was read at face value then the SCOUTS wouldn't make it apply any further than it was written, ever. \n\nMy interpretation comes from the fact even in the 1770s, the founding fathers saw arms, and their evolution from times past, knowing a firm set of rigid rules becoming archaic as the technology gets more advance. Hell, it has served that function by keeping military weaponry out of the hands of civilians. I simply think that owning a gun should be more than JUST going to a gun store, plopping down your 1000 bucks, and owning a weapon (the laissez faire attitude, which is what the NRA seems to think it is). I instead think people should have to prove their competency before owning one. Doing so, the way I see it, does not infringe on a "well regulated militia."\n\nGet off your high horse BTW, your elevated mood is showing.
Nah, see, the way I see it, well regulated has rules and *gasp* regulations to it. Not a laissez faire attitude the NRA seems to see.
You fucking sure about that?\n\n[Proof](http://imgur.com/a/X1kTF)
A lot of the *cash value* is from grains and wheat, a huge portion of those are not for HUMAN consumption, a lot goes to livestock and a lot goes to energy. 
Are you donald trump? jesus dude, you are a tiny man. 
Wait, they watch them once or twice a week already and she wants to move away from that free once or twice a week daycare because they don't do more? That is like the quintessential cutting off one's nose to spite their face
By definition of "state" yes it is
It brings in another problem. As fast as these things spin, between 25000 and 40000 RPM would then have tremendous heat generated from the friction. This heat would destroy the blood products, and possibly the tubing it self, its all plastic. 
My A&P professor taught at both, and she was harder on us. The universities was easier overall.
"Be the change you want to see" its how I live. I know for old time nurses, they tend to still eat their young, or make it hard because they had it difficult. Others just don't want the extra stress. I hope I can be like her to my future students 
I am trying to recreate it. There is no swivel ring, the thing transports blood, its a closed system. The tube is wrapped around the drum. A swivel ring would possibly cross the separated products again, defeating the purpose (the whole point of the procedure being done was to remove the patients white blood cells and antibodies, as they had an autoimmune disease.) \n\nBased on my bad recreation, I suspect the shape of it is the whole reason. Something with it curving around on itself exiting and entering 90 degrees from where it bends out from the incoming, instead of going straight in to the ring and back out. 
LMAO! Good one.\n\n\nCheers
Lets review shall we? \n\n* You want an abortion\n\n* boyfriend doesn't\n\n* its your body\n\n* Hes cheated on you.\n\n* He projects his insecurities on you.\n\n* Hes a deadbeat living off his parents good will.\n\n* You're the bread winner as it sit. \n\n* Your relationship is already on bad time\n\n* You will go into massive debt to have said kid, because you don't have health insurance. Who will pay for that? You?\n\n* Your parents are very anti abortion. \n\n* **YOU STILL LOVE HIM** \n\nSo after reviewing all the points, in my humble opinion, have an abortion. Don't tell your parents and play it off like a miscarriage (I always point out, you arn't lying, as miscarriages are medically called "Spontaneous abortion"). You may not even want the kid when its said and done, if thats really the case, is it fair to that future child to have parents who don't care for it properly? Not saying you would neglect it, but think about it. This child will tie you to this guy for **THE REST OF YOUR LIFE**. Having children, marrying, moving, they don't fix issues magically, the issues are still there. \n\nProtect yourself, u/Lilsashimi its very important you do. Look into an IUD afterwards, make an appointment with Planned Parenthood, 3 hours away if you have to. It will help preserve your sanity. \n\nI wish you the best, and I hope no matter what, you're satisfied with your decision 
Yep. I appreciate tough professors when they are doing it to prepare us. My A&p professor was a former nurse. Her explanation of things was at the level of my rn class. A lot of stuff my classmates struggle with I don't because of her. 
I am in the medical field, nursing student and I honestly don't interact with many people with SCI in my units. In the event I do, do you have any suggestions that could help me be better for your experience, or improve your stay in the hospital? \n\nDo you have any career goals post accident?
I cringed. Holy hell, I did that once too. THAT fucking hurt. It was like my body went "HEY YOU DUMB FUCK, IM HEALING OVER HERE!"\n\nThe worse though was setting it the first time. My arm originally broke in a legit U shape, I could almost touch my shoulder without bending my elbow. My brother, 8 or 9 at the time, bent it back into straight, instead of doing it the proper way (I don't blame him, we were kids), in this process he caught the ulnar nerve apparently, and when they went to set it properly, holy hell, it grind the nerve, that was the most intense pain I have EVER felt, like a 11/10, the agony. ugh
It was already playing in my head when I saw it
3rd
Olfactory, Optical, Oculomotor, Trochanter, Trigeminal, Abducens, Facial, Vestibulocochlear, glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, hypoglossal   
That would require the whole unit spinning, but it doesnt. With your analogy, its like taking the two ends of the hose, tieing the ends down, then spinning the U, but not twisting it.
There were no calls for ems in the area at the time 
Poor keyboard tough guy. There there. 
Instead we should encourage friend to seek out each other and ask them how they're doing. Not everyone is willing to admit they're feeling the lowest of low so freely. Not to criticize you, but its not hard to say to a friend, "hey, how are you doing, really" 
Fuck.... Not bad though for having taken A&P 4 years ago.... Damn that seems so long ago.
Will your CNA help your application? Sure, you will probably get bonus points for the application. Is it a deal breaker to not have it? Well if you're close to the line then sure, it can be. I personally went for my EMT-B license while trying to get in, they didn't care about the fact it was an EMT vs a CNA. I did however notice the difference in my CNA holding classmates vs myself. They were better with the fundamentals (Bed making, bed baths, ambulation, bed pans, range of motion, so on), when we got to patient assessment and interactions during so, I was ahead of them as patient assessments went because it was in my scope as an EMT, it was quicker for me, while my classmates took a while to get their bearings under them. My nurses I work with, and my clinical professors always ask when the first time they see me do a skill if I have been in health care. This isn't to boast, but to show we all take different paths, there is no one set path for us.\n\nAll that said, you are in california, GET IN WHERE YOU CAN! Once you take the NCLEX it is easier to get your RN to BSN. Class sizes are limited to clinical placement slots. The community colleges in my area of California do classes of 40, one does a yearly admit of one class of 40. The CSU here does classes of 80 every semester, the difference comes in two ways. The CSU does once weekly clinicals, and the CCs do twice weekly. The preceptorship in the CCs are 1/2 clinical 1/2 preceptorship. In the CSU its full 200 hour preceptorship. At the end of it all though, we take the same NCLEX -RN, so its a moot point. Anyone who has worked as an RN will tell you most the learning is done on the job, all nursing school teaches you is how to be safe.\n\nMy final piece of advice is put private schools on the back burner, only consider them if you have exhausted EVERYTHING ELSE! We do have a private school with an ABSN that is 68k for just the program, twice that if you do their pre reqs. Do not go into massive debt for your RN! APRN/DNP sure, but general RN? not worth it. This private program is done in 18 months, vs my program of 24, but I get summers and weekends off. They go 18 months solid, at a breakneck speed, have clinicals on weekends, and never get a break. They have a high attrition rate because of it.\n\nAdditionally, you are 19, you are young, and thus not tied down. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO MOVE AWAY! Move away for a year or 2, get that experience under your belt, and then move back to whatever unit you want. There is a NATIONAL nursing shortage, think of places that no one wants to live, they will hire you if you have a license and a pulse. Or be persistent, only ONE hospital around here is BSN only, and they are just the one hospital, a university hospital. We have 3 other large health systems in our major metro area, one for profit, two non profits. The for profit has began to hire fresh RN grads recently, one of the nonprofits (the one I want to work at) preferrs BSN, but they will still hire ADN, and if you are in a program for your BSN they consider it the same as having one. \n\nSo yeah, theres my 4 cents on the whole shebang.
Let flip genders for a second. You're a dude, Jake is Jackie, and your friend is your bro. Your friend keeps trying to get into Jakie's pants, but Jackie keeps shooting him down week after week, and finally says lets do some shots and slips Jackie a Xanex to get in her pants. People make light of what has happened and walk in on your bro on top of Jackie, who is passed out.\n\nNow, would you come here and say the same thing, feeling bad for your bro, who was the one who fucked up, dating the girl he really wanted so much to become a sleazebag extreme to get what he wanted. No, or at least I hope you wouldn't want to be friends with such a person. \n\nIt was not Jake's fault he has women falling over for him (as you make it seem), just as much as it is not a woman's fault for dressing some way that "provokes men" (bullshit IMO). Now had your friend not crossed a huge line, and you felt this way about liking the same guy, then I could see your dilemma; bros before hoes, chicks before dicks and all. It would be one thing (though not much better) if she and Jake just drank too much (mutually) and Jake did something he regretted. It is an entirely different, much higher on the order of ass hats in society to PREMEDITATE SEXUAL ASSAULT. Think about that for just one second, your friend had the mind of "I am going to drug this guy I like so he'll fuck me" if that doesn't send shivers down your spine, I wonder about you. \n\nNow this is slippery slope territory, but if the shoe fits why not put it on. But let's say you DIDN'T make light of what happened, is it such a leap that she would play on gender roles to NOT get caught/paint jake as a bad guy, as the aggressor? God she told someone her plan, and they didn't stop her right there. Either she knew what she was doing was bad but couldn't stop herself, or she was so confident in how quickly we paint men as the bad guys she would get away scott free.\n\nIf I had a friend, any friend, be it a casual acquaintance to my best friend of 20 years come up and tell me the same thing, I would lay them out on the deck faster than then they could say "Im a sleeze ball." \n\nTL;DR you owe your ex-friend nothing, hell, even if it is turning the dagger, turn that muther fucker till it wont turn any more. Make her anguish in her mistake, maybe, JUST MAYBE, she wont premeditate sexual assault again. 
You mean vs California that CURRENTLY has the fifth highest GDP if it were its own country?(thank Brexit). I am curious when Texas did that though. 
If you're going to make a claim to what they meant, and present it as a fact, I will need to see a source on such a thing.
I have a slight curve of it, but you can only see it if I point it out. Thankfully the bone broke in no point of muscle attachment. Its about 2 inches from the olecranon process of the ulna (the thing people bang when the hit their elbow), and I never got PT with it. Probably should have, I still have probably 75% coordination with it compared to my right hand. 
This isn't you want a subaru and she wants a chevy, this is a life decision. You are either dead set on kids or you are not or you're a fence sitter and open to it. If you are on one end of the absolutes, there is no such thing as comprime without resentment. \n\nSo to that I say, split. If you want to be gentle, tell her like you told us. You realize the more you reflect on what she has been saying, the more you realize you don't want those things in life, and denying her those wants isn't fair to her. \n\nYes its going to end the relationship, these are called deal breakers for a reason. 
Side note, 750,000 ER vistis a year blows my mind. Thats roughly 86 patients an hour averaged, every hour, of every day, all year. Now obviously it doesn't work out like that because people wait till the morning to get urgent things they think cant wait for. You need like 24 nurses an hour to keep patient ratios safe, and thats only if there were no major intakes. That to me is nuts. (for reference I am a nursing student).
Think of every post apocalyptic movie ever. Its like that.
US too, if you find out your employer spoke ill about you, you can sue them for slander and win. Protect your ass if you're ever in management and simply say factual things, the easiest one is "No, I would not hire this person again" it says nothing of subjective nature of the person, it doesnt say WHY you would not rehire the person, it just says you wouldn't make that mistake again, and sometimes that is more then anything else you could add.
Hater, such you are
My arm hurts more now, when pressure changes, then the breaks ever did. Different strokes for different folks. I am fairly resistant to acute pain\n
A huge portion of the grain grown is not for human consumption but energy needs. 
Dozens of unicorns! ugh lol
I had a friend commit suicide 2 years ago, and while we never close friends, it still breaks my heart that they truly felt death was the only way out. I feel your pain so much. I was ridiculed because I felt pain for the loss of a casual friend, even though I didn't ask his family how he went through it. Just because we know someone only casually at best, doesn't mean the shock of their sudden death would hurt any less. So if you feel pain, don't downplay it just because you weren't as close. It is just as valid as anyone else.\n\nAs someone suffering from depression I present an outward upbeat, and outgoing personality to those around me. I do it because I am in the medical field, and I know my depression, my anxiety, can make patients worse, it really can rub off on them. That said, I make it an effort however to tell my close friends about my struggles with this disease. Mental health is not something to be swept under the rug, why would you shame someone with cancer or bronchitis, but someone with depression or psychosis is "broken", someone to be outcast, something to not talk about. To be fair, I even see myself as broken, because I am, I am not what people consider normal, I am depressed. For the first time ever on Jan 3rd I had an intrusive thought that told me I was the lowest of the low, I was worth nothing, I was scum, and I should just end it all because the bullet in my head would be worth more than the life I live. It fucking terrified me to no end. I ran to the hospital because I was so scared of it. It was a fear, and feelings I had never felt before. I am lucky in my disease, I have enough presence of mind to go "this isn't OK, this isnt right, something is wrong, I can't do this alone **I NEED HELP**.\n\nIt is so hard for people to admit that they can't do it alone. Falling down isn't weakness, refusing to get up is. Asking for help isn't cowardly, its courageous. 
What took you away from Sacramento?
Not really, broke my left arm, full ulna radius break, 3 times. Each time no pain, like a 1 or 2 tops.
I'd love to score that. 
That's kinda creepy dude. You'd be taking an urn out. I mean it's not legal to seduce the dead. You might want to pump the breaks there. Plus, I'm 30. Kinda hard to ground me. Ps PC master race yo

This one is for treatment, not donation. Its for treatment of a autoimmune disease. It need to fully separate out the blood products. If even one RBC is sensed in the plasma post separation, the thing emergency stops because the flip side can happen too.

Doubtful, as CA was still around 5th or 6th then. If you're going to make claims like that, at least be willing to support them. \n\nI looked it up, TX is currently 11th in the world. California is 6th (just passed by a recovering UK). The numbers are: 1.4 trillion for TX, 2.2 trillion for CA.  When gas peaked in 2008, CA had a GDP of 2.0 Trillion, Texas had a 1.1 Trillion GDP. Texas passt 1 trillion in 2007, CA did it in the early 90s. \n\nI know you were going for when gas was so expensive, but California is the 4th largest producer in the country. It is also the source of 80% of the food in the US, and the tech industry. CA is diversified in its economy, Texas is not nearly as much, but it's catching up.

She was so very patient with me, she walked me through her steps of preparing an IV push (A new skill for us this semester), and verifying how she did it with the actual facility policy not just "this is how I do it". I had a new IVPB med I hadn't given before (a powdered antibiotic that I had to prepare, my facilites last semester they were all pre mixed), and she walked me through doing the steps physically so I would get the psycho motor skills going. She explained to me why she was calling different groups (doctors, pharmacy, labs ect.) instead of just saying I called this group and they ordered/are doing this. She educated me on the diagnoses of her other patients in her down time. \n\nIt was a first for me honestly, and I learned so much on these two days that I just hadn't received in school, and I feel like letting her manager know is the least I could do.
Throwin my hat in the ring again!\n\nI am 30, male, and in the sacramento area of CA. Looking for a relationship preferably \n\nI am in my second year of nursing school, and should be done in December. I love the profession and helping people. I love geeky/nerdy things. I am an avid learner, and I dream of traveling all over the world, and helping those not lucky enough to live in the first world. I am an ambivert and can go either way with my social activities. I like boardgames with friends, or gaming with my far away ones.

Not familiar with Moneris, but if it's a one time or the same event reoccurs, how about using eventbrite? Not sure eventbrite works with Moneris, but having used eventbrite in the past it's a pretty easy solution, and it will save you time setting up event espresso.\n\nFor ticketing solutions you could check out Peek, and fairHarbor. I use fairHarbor now, but I setup lots of events. From what I'm getting, eventbrite might be just right for you.\n\nPeek & fairHarbor both work with stripe, it's integrated in the system, you don't event have to setup a stripe account, put in the bank credentials and the just flows right in. Eventbrite has some options for payment processing.

Yeah exactly. I'm not too concerned about downvotes. I'm pretty sure they're not from musicians. 
Only if they also attend a private school. 
You forgot the part where you pretend that amount of work and materials is worth twice what it is, and then stick it to the customer, hoping that their insurance company won't say anything. 
My bad. Sorry about the cancer. 
I think they were saying the movie reminded them of movies from a time when movies were better quality. Never saw interstellar so I couldn't speak to that. 
No one said it was a coincidence until someone said that specifically wasn't. Someone took issue with the word "aligned." That is all.

The problem is that usually, objectively describing his actions and choices could be construed as serious criticism, due to his lack of experience and poor critical thinking skills.

I agree, I'm just wondering if it was in game shitty or like real life harming others type shitty. 
A strawman argument is when a person makes an argument against an argument that was never made in the first place, like you did regarding whether people can afford to use their insurance. By setting up an argument that is self evident (more people are insured, therefore more people can't afford their copay,) and then proceeding to "prove" it, you're committing a classic strawman. My original point had nothing to do with whether an increasing number of people can afford to use their insurance, since obviously an increase in insured people will also create an increase in those who can and cannot afford their copays.  You are correct that the term "strawman" is commonly misused, but it's also common used correctly, like when I used it just now calling you out on your bullshit.
I came. 
Pure bullshit more like. Fuckin shitbirds and your AppStore opening links. 
Just like I thought, you're quite fetching. Any intruder should feel lucky to come across you sleeping in the buff.
Yeah, real drunks are too experienced to do this. 
As a dude who started to develop the ole reverse Mohawk when I was 16, I can guarantee you it won't keep you from getting laid regularly. Shave that shit. Bald is cooler than balding. 
I wasn't, but I would if one of his friends proceeded to kick his ass. 
Let's examine that claim. The collosal titan is 60 meters tall. An order of magnitude is generally accepted as being 10 times the size. So in order to be several (3) orders of magnitude bigger, that thing would have to be 60,000 meters tall. \n\nEdit, that's 34 miles. It's not 34 miles tall. 
Where mike went..
Resolve and critical thinking are two different things. One only has to look at the current suspension of his travel ban to see that he doesn't know what he's doing and can't operate effectively as president. 
I told you I'm not a lawyer, now unclench. 
And then you get force choked. \n\n
Where on Reddit are people preventing the courts from doing their job? Or do you just have a problem with people expressing their opinions in public forums?
Not poor enough, more like. I got an Atari 2600 the same year sega genesis came out. 
Don't worry, I won't tell your customers you're robbing them.  You can unclench now. The part where you said labor costs are fair made me laugh out loud. 
What part of "I could be wrong" do you not understand?\n\n;)
I'm not sure if you understand what a strawman argument is, based on this sorry excuse for a response. Yes, insurers have had a difficult time adjusting to the standards set by Obamacare. That has nothing to do with my point, which is that obamacare has had the overall effect of creating a more insured and better insured population, and the net benefit has been positive. Again, what you're saying really doesn't speak to that in any meaningful way, but you're clinging to it as if it had relevance, which is what people tend to do when they've been called out on making a strawman argument. And quit it with the "sir" shit. I'm not your karate instructor. 
Oh yeah.
QuoteMe-Bot is a fuckin stupid idea, don't quote me on that though.

The reason for all that shit is to discuss issues that people are sensitive about without having to stop midway (or deal with later backlash) when some hypersensitive person freaks out. Granted people abuse the sensitivity they're shown, but the reason for it is so that adult minds can discuss difficult topics without someone's sensitivities clouding the issue. 
Nothing impresses women like senseless, petty violence over a Salvation Army coffee table. 
In some cases that might be kind of freeing. 
I'm amazed at how pedantic you're able to be.  You almost distracted me from your second strawman argument (that I've noticed.) Obamacare wasn't designed for you. It was designed for people who were previously uninsured. \n\nIn American karate, as well as at least 2 Korean forms of martial arts that I'm aware of, the instructor is typically addressed as sir (or m'am in at least one instance I'm aware of.) So wrong again, bud. \n\nNothing you've posted supports the argument that Obamacare hasn't had a net positive impact, and you're asking for evidence I've already provided. Obviously you didn't read any of my links, which isn't surprising. You're simply comparing your own situation to the situation in Massachusetts prior to Obamacare, disregarding the fact that Massachusetts was already one of the best insured states in the nation. Your grumbling about your deductibles is really a complaint you need to bring up with your plan provider, since there are a wide range of them available and they're the ones who've made your healthcare unaffordable. \n\nThe rest of your post is essentially pendantry without purpose. But it was long at least. Nice job on that, sensei. 
Fuck them into submission with my vicious morning wood. 
I don't think she's the main hero either and considering there's multiple versions of both of us it's not that simple I guess. 
Naw. I bet you're beautiful. 
Can't afford  to use it? Hilariously pointless strawman. Of course when more people are insured there will be more who can't afford to use their insurance, and more who can. Nice debate skills, bud. 
I hope you feel good about yourself. 
It's hard not to considering how bad he is at being president. 
Didn't upvote the other guy, but now I'm impressed. 
I'm not looking for respect, since you've demonstrated that respect from someone with a mind such as yours would be of very little value.  Calling someone a troll when you have no valid argument and have already been called out on your nonsense is a pretty simplistic tactic.  I don't know, maybe you do actually think you've made some sort of point. Please don't respond. I'm not interested in hearing any more of what you've got to say since you're not actually making any sort of coherent point. Or do, and I'll continue to point out just how incoherent you are. Example, your previous post lamented that middle class people can't afford to use their insurance. Then you followed that up by saying that your argument isn't a strawman since you never said you personally couldn't afford to use it. Incoherent babble from a weak, undisciplined mind. 
Scareold 
I guess I meant an experienced musician. Vote your heart, bud, but don't kid yourself, barring some sort of finger disability, no serious guitarist would encourage the use of these things. 
I don't think you're using the term "orders of magnitude" correctly. \n
The "why" here is very obvious. The person who applied the product just sucks at it. 
While your interpretation of the dynamics of the ACA are laughable, the real problem with your previous statement is that the people who pay for their own insurance are opposed to Obamacare. The people who are opposed are generally low income conservatives from welfare states, which many "red" states tend to be. The more affluent, "blue" states tend to be populated by liberals who buy their own health care and understand the importance of a well insured society. \n\nThrough Obamacare, the middle class has become more insured, not less. This is because it's not just a mandate to buy health insurance but also a set of standards that insurers must meet. 
You got all that from what he said? Ok I'll go along with that, but you're being charitable. 
Speak for yourself. 
It's unclear how you're correcting me, since as I pointed out, no one claimed it was a coincidence. The first time someone mentioned the word, it was to state that it wasn't a coincidence. 
Y'all dropped the ball. Blame white men all you want but 4 out of 10 women voted for the cheeto. I personally would love to see feminism become relevant again since I agree with the basic premise (equality, right?) but I worry that it's descended into total nonsense as the people who were children during the age of Obama become entitled, misguided adults. No, America isn't a liberal paradise, and no everyone doesn't share liberal values. We had a decent run with Obama, but a lot of young people, and a good portion of the feminist movement (such as it is) really took that for granted. It's going to get worse before it gets better. 
Yeah but I killed all those guys and dealt with that airship bullshit at the end. I'm the protagonist/antagonist. 
This is stupid, have a downvote. 
Yeah, not everybody shares my opinion. Not everybody can play guitar either. 
I feel like he should not have said that. 
The only reason Trump is effective at any of this is the profound stupidity of his supporters. It's almost as if his candidacy was entirely built around the stupidity of the LCD. 
that's a lot of words to use to say "I disagree with you and I will google articles that support my point." I'm pretty sure I established my position in my previous posts but if you need any clarification let me know (you do.)
Really, though, what are you going to do that he didn't already do himself? Harm and humiliate him? He's way ahead of you. 
Lol.  When the tides come in you would immediately be set free.  Also, the last part about bloodflow is just baloney.  Mud doesn't put that much pressure on you... 
Trump's F-35 Surprise: Boeing CEO was in the room when [Lt. Gen Bogdan, who is in the US Armed Forces, not a Lockheed employee]  got the Call
Meh, he could do more. He is the richest man alive after all, and getting richer.  \n\nReally do something on a massive scale I say.  Do something that will last.  What will happen when he dies?  Will they still be giving out nets in Africa?  Will that be the extent of it?  There are a lot of problems.  
Um, if you deal with doctors in a business environment, they have a reputation for having large egos and do believe they know everything.  Even though they have a very specialized knowledge base that probably makes them about as capable as a high school teenager at most other positions, including business management. 
Seems like it.  But he's also THE shining beacon for the neo-liberal movement.  The rising-tide-raises-all-ships argument. Trickle-down economics theory.  The hyper-rich do more good than we can, etc. \n\nIf you talk to any neo-liberal, Bill Gates is sure to come up sooner rather than later. \n\nThe shame is the guy was an asshole when he was working, way worse than stories of Jobs because Bill ruined several people's lives and single-handedly destroyed the largest corporation in the tech industry at the time through betrayal and unethical dealings.  \n\nNow that he's retired he does contribute to charity, but he's still making money...  Imagine how much taxes he would pay if he were not running his foundation?  That's what he's really doing all this for.  It's not particularly great for America either, especially since most of his charity work is abroad, but then again I am sympathetic to the developing world.  I just don't think we should praise Gates for doing what any rational person with his amount of wealth would do to manage their tax burdens. 
Meh, it's just what the money tells them to do.  It's not based on a rationality concerning the issue.  It's based on a cynical belief that ideas and the framing of reality are up for sale to the highest bidder. \n\nNone of the people in power that deny global warming truly believe it is false, nor do they care.  They just know that it is in their best interest to deny it.  It's very myopic but that's what they do. 
Vista is much uglier.  It's also the greatest sin Microsoft ever committed.  And this is a company that released Windows ME. 
It should also be noted that all most all of the gains, if I'm not mistaken, are in the last 5 years.  So if you withdrew your capital for whatever reason in that first 15 year period of stagnation with two major market corrections, you kinda got screwed. 
You're right, and we can see the backlash now that many realize those subsidies were all renewables needed to be viable.  But the sun is not a scarce resource, renewables by their nature are not scarce, so they are now attempting to reverse all the progress we've done to create the renewable sector.  It's going to be very difficult for them, but with so much wealth and power they can probably achieve it. \n\nCapitalism is a fine system as long as it serves us.  But it is dangerous because it naturally tends towards concentrated power and a will to enslave or dispense of lower classes. 
They were.  It was a buying opportunity after the SCTY non-issue.  I just couldn't pull the trigger though.  Now it's back to ridiculous territory.  Frankly the stock is bipolar, which can create opportunities, but it's risky. 
It's hard to find legit shit these days. Everything is predetermined by those with money. 
You are right. This is an incorrect usage. Straw men are not backed by statistics. Straw men are by definition false representations. If statistics prove a point, then there can be no misrepresention. While the reasons for a statistic are up for debate, it's not a straw man to try to come up with reasons why something is in fact true. \n
Exact same problem. Had to do a chargeback. Getting a peek into how dysfunctional they are was enlightening. 
Oh my god! They should just let people discriminate freely.  If it's one thing I hate it's being labeled a hate group for exercising my right to discriminate. 
Wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen.

Not to mention that Chevy just unveiled a car that will compete directly with the 3 and is cheaper.  I'll let you decide who wins that battle...
I think it just boils down to American taste in comedy.  Russell Peters just does very anecdotal bits which in the US come across as corny.  We like things to be steeped in layers of irony and sarcasm and cynicism. \n\nI dunno I saw him a few years ago on Netflix and didn't care for him.  
Dahlonega isn't Atlanta. 
Even without automation, UBI is an efficient way to redistribute wealth.  We currently have a problem.  It's not a projection.  Inequality is real and increasing at alarming rates.  People are suffering.  It's not reported very much, but look at the populist movements across the globe.  Electorates don't react like that, in a scared and outraged manner, unless there is a serious underlying issue.  I see it.  It is tough in the economy right now if you aren't college educated and that is a surprising amount of people and most of them simply cannot pass college to obtain a degree. 
>they bailed out the debtors on the backs of savers\n\nDebtors = savers  \n\nI think what you are confusing is the lone fiscal policy that resulted from the crisis, which was the redistribution of wealth from the taxpayers to the debtors.  From the middle to the top.  Corporate welfare.  That was the greatest tragedy of the whole ordeal. 
We're coming out of a long-term debt cycle.  Things are going to be surprisingly good I think.  Something we haven't seen in 15 years or so. \n\nOr we're going to have one last mega-crash.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
You're exactly right about it being a tool. It is used by the wealthy exploiting capitalists in these areas to create a common enemy for them to be against. When really it is the capitalist who are hoarding all the profits of the local economy because they often are a small group that has complete control in these areas. Often times they are even corrupt and redirecting funds to themselves illegally. They take out all the gains and invest nothing back into the local economy and refuse to pay fair wages. So the racism is used as a mechanism to redirect hatred from where it should be placed. 
She did one of these last year.  I wonder if she's an accountant?  She seems too creative and beautiful to be in my field though, haha. 
>For every index that someone gives me that outperforms actively managed funds, I can always bring up an actively managed fund that heavily outperforms an index.\n\nAnd of those, there are none that are affordable to a person like me.  They all have huge capital requirements and high expense ratios, which makes them unattainable and highly-risky for all but the most wealthy investors.  \n\n>There is absolutely no reason why you should be 100% invested in index funds if you decide that you'd rather dedicate time and effort into the investment process.\n\nIf you're investing in active funds, then your time and effort is irrelevant. You're still paying someone to make decisions for you.  Rather you are paying them for their subjective investment process versus someone who is supposed to objectively invest based on quantifiable metrics.  \n\nLook I invest in standalone stocks as a hobby.  So I understand where you are coming from.  My returns there have been far greater than my passive retirement portfolio, but it IS time-consuming to do the research and monitor the positions.  Plus there is inherently more risk.  I do not want to risk my future well-being on me or someone else being right \n\nThat's why for most folks, and almost unanimously for tax-advantaged retirement accounts, people should invest in indexes.  If you're lucky enough to have extra funds to invest after you've saved for retirement, sure take some more risky ventures.  But most people choose to actually live their lives after they've laid the foundation for their future.  Only the ridiculously wealthy have the luxury to save, spend, and gamble all at the same time. 
IRA is a tax-advantaged investment account. It is not an asset-class you invest in. \n\nYou can have an IRA and invest the funds in stocks, bonds, CDs, or money market still. 
I would suggest that any money you plan to withdraw in the next 15 years should not be in stocks. 
I see a lot of pent up potential masking old fundamental problems that have never been addressed.  That can be a dangerous combination. 
Because Fed = evil is not the same as Raising rates = scary.  The latter is much more rational if you know the reasons why. 
2000-2003 was a bit abnormal.  I think it may be the first purely emotional driven crash since the Great Depression.  Just be glad that it didn't line up with the debt crisis in 2007. 
If you look at the context of this run, there isn't much greed in sight.  2011-2015 was pretty good but it was really just a recovery.  SPY crossed over the high it set in the year 1999 in the year 2012.  Since then we've averaged about 8% annually including today's high.  It's a little hot maybe but not really considering what came before.  There's no reason we aren't coming out of a long-term debt cycle and into a period of extended growth.  It's something people just aren't familiar or comfortable with anymore because it's been decades since we've had good times. \n\nNow there is one other possibility.  If you look at 1929, there were troubles through the mid-20s, and then in 1929 the stock market shot off like a rocket.  Only to come down with incredible force.  We could be gearing up for that... but I just don't think so.  That's my gut feeling.  There's too much caution.  What's happening now is people are coming out and realizing they don't see their shadow.   Summer time is around the corner. 
Oh, /s.  \n\nYeah I prefer Brave New World's take on it all.  But I suppose that's more Reddit anyway. 
Sure doesn't deserve to be horded by capitalist at the expenses of the majority though.  They aren't even the ones who created it.  They're just the ones with enough capital to use it. 
I saw a guy who did a poll last week that said bullish sentiment was 59%.  40% was euphoric, 19% was cautious.  On that graph I think we are just passing optimism. 
If they were mostly anything else it would be ok to describe them as such. Your fantacizing a reaction that doesn't exist.  
Eventually we will all get used to it though. 
1 year I'd expect a 1% return from a high interest savings account. \n\n5 years i'd expect a 2-3% return from some intermediate length bonds. \n\n10 years I would expect a 5%+ return from a stock /bond mix. 
>or the largest most stable economy in the history of the world\n\nLargest, yes.  Most stable?  I dunno, seems pretty shaky lately.  I'm pretty sure all the great economies looked like this at some point before things started to come off the rails.
Better than voting in more corruption.  At least now we're gonna break and maybe the DNC will get on board with what I as a progressive fucking want.  Or maybe not and our revolution will continue. \n\nI didn't want 8 more years of Obama.  I want some real progress.  Obama was milquetoast. And HRC would have been even more so.  She was a completely uninspiring candidate with tons of baggage and corruption and scandals that follow her almost as much as Mr. Trump. 
Consumerism is a helluva drug. Run on your little treadmill like a good boy and they'll drop you a bit of SOMA every now and then. 
He was just as corrupt as Mr. Trump, except his advisors were our own oligarchs. I guess that makes it better somehow. 
This is why you don't militarize your police force first of all.  Many terrible things could happen even right now if we were to start giving police more military hardware.  
Enron was precisely like that because the whole idea was to create the illusion of a ridiculously successful, innovative, and energetic corporation. 
Yeah! Fuck 'em! They reported on Bernie.  That should be treason, goddamit.  No one should have reported on Bernie.  /s\n\nYou're a fucking shill. 
That one guy pretty much justifies the whole thing IMO.  /s
He runs the foundation because it is the best way for him to manage his tax burdens.  All those gains, including the 28 billion given away would be taxed. But $28 billion is around 50% of his net gains since then.  That probably has effectively lowered his tax burden to around $0 if he did it right. 
Um.  People will not be satisfied with receiving subsidies that barely cover their existence.  If your logic were correct, why wouldn't everyone just find a low-paying job that was easy and just chill there.  Yet people take on all kinds or ridiculous tasks and work extreme hours to get more.  Same would apply under UBI. \n\nAlso you seem to think the economy will fundamentally change.  It will not.  People will still trade goods and services for money...  Wealth will be redistributed from the top to the bottom, much more efficiently than it is now.  Redistribution is a critical part of maintaining a capitalist system that does not result in the runaway inequality we see today. 
 You're just as bigoted as them then and there will be no resolution or healing through your system of belief which I would say is the predominant one among the left. Only further strife. \n\nThink about how your words echo there's when referring to poor blacks and crime. 
Russia was anti-Clinton but I don't remember any pro-Bernie from them.  There's a lot of history re-writing in this thread, you should be careful what you insinuate. 
>Can we also agree that the government does not always run its enterprises in the most efficient and/or best manner? \n\nAnd some things the private sector does inefficiently.  If you've ever seen the contractors in the military industrial complex, the ones working with the DoD, you would know that just because the government contracts a job, doesn't mean it gets done efficiently or, most critically, properly. 
Maybe he didn't want to run a divisive campaign that ostracizes white voters like the DNC does year after year and the same strategy that cost them the election this time.  I hate to say it but the black vote simply doesn't matter anymore.  Rural white America is pissed and they are a larger part of the demographic.  Bernie's message and strategy was much more in line with what would have won the election because his was one of unity.   All different races are poor and suffering right now.  The DNC message that just black people are oppressed rings hollow to most working class people these days. 
No.  I've talked to them.  They don't even know what's going on and their retort is to mumble something about better than Hillary. 
Man, if you weren't so preachy it'd be ok.  Look I know humans are half-evolved monkey shit-brains.  You don't have to tell me that.  Shit if there were aliens I would hope they would save us or put us out of our misery.  We need fucking help.  But they're not here and they're not coming.  It's all us, baby.  Alone with all our flaws and shortcomings. 
No, subsidizing failing industries can easily destroy start-up industries looking to compete with them.  
They don't.  Men especially need to be married or our life expectancy is something like 10 years less?  I don't remember but there have been studies that show that men who aren't married don't live as long.  Also, men who don't have sex don't live as long.  Life is cruel. 
>You can disregard just about anything Chomsky has to say about economics\n\nOh I can, can I? What a compelling argument.  /s

The funny thing about XP is that it was the first solid OS Microsoft had released, ever (2000 was XP beta-testing, and for the most part is just an earlier version of XP, so that doesn't count). \n\nThis was revolutionary at the time.  It was not great by any measures.  It's just that all the stuff they had released before was such crap and Microsoft had imposed a monopoly, that people were accustomed to garbage.  I mean XP only crashed like what, once a week?  That's AMAZING!  95 did it about once every couple hours.  \n\nBut still XP was a resource hog for its time and it DID crash from time to time.    \n\nI feel like 7 was really the peek.  When I first tried 7 I was truly impressed.  I was like, hey, MSFT has finally caught up with Linux.  It has great design, never crashes, and has solid performance.  \n\nNow we get 10 which is SpywareOS.  Oh it's a great OS.  It's just that I don't have control over it as an administrator.  That's a mortal sin.  An OS should control the system.  That's it job.  It shouldn't be mining my data and doing all this other shit that I can't turn off. 
Running. 
OK, we've got gameplay depth. Something more than just a glorified scavenger hunt. That's a great start to make this stand out from the pack. But don't forget that DayZ has some of the best ballistics simulation tech around. \n\nThe core problem with these games is always netcode.  How are you going to land these technical punches if the server is off by 100ms or more? How does the game handle interactions between you and the world and you and other players?  It's always been the big question and the hardest to answer.  \n\nThis game looks great and actually has me excited but they've got to figure out how to make it playable online for it to really be any different than all the other shovelware games in this genre. 
The US is fucked right now. Logic, intelligence, compassion are marginalized.  I don't know where we end up from here.  I don't like this ride either.  These are the kind of people who when you merely provide information that counters their point of view they become hostile.  It's disturbing and depressing to see my country overrun by this mania. 
Oh it's stable.  Easy-to-use?  In what universe?  You can't control this OS.  It tells you what it's going to do and you better just learn to deal with it.  \n\nIt's going to spy on you.  It's going to constantly communicate over the network in the background.  An OS should be completely under my control and not doing anything I can't see or don't have control over.  It is the core of the system.  What Microsoft has created is a travesty and a dark path we're headed down in terms of OS design. 
This is dumb.  The best answer to automation and taxation is consumption tax with UBI prebates and income taxes only targetted at the top earners. 
Check out the Chevy Bolt then.  
Steve Jobs is dead. 
What does INT do for you in this game? 
Pretty spot on except I've seen a poll that says we are leaning optimism.  59% bullish.  40% convinced, 19% cautiously. 
>terrible, awful, miserable practice\n\nIf you use so many adjectives it must be true.  /s\n\nRedistribution is a necessary control on capitalism.  The rich get richer in a capitalist system and the poor do more for the economy per dollar.

Well you are who your friends are.  
Um, all these responses are shit.   Why are we focused on BMing?  There are actual reasons this happens.  \n\nThere are two primary reasons people are so nervous about the Fed raising rates. \n\nThe first is the fact that raising rates is contractionary to the economy, which means it lowers the money supply and slows growth.  That's bad for business, that's bad for stocks.  \n\nOf course the reason they would do this is because the economy should also be growing at a faster rate.  They are essentially trying to prevent growth from being too fast and reducing volatility.  Nobody likes this because people are generally myopic and would rather have good times now and deal with the consequences later.  The Fed is playing party-pooper when it raises rates by slowing growth. Nobody likes a party-pooper.  \n\nThe second reason is that the last time the Fed raised rates they caused the Recession in 2008.  Uh oh!  The very instrument that was supposed to save us from volatility caused the greatest correction since 1929.  But why?  Well the simple answer is that they lowered them really fast and then raised them really fast causing a credit crunch.  There's a little more to it than that though. Suffice it to say, people are still a little gun shy, even though we've seen much more cautious policy since then. 
X is the market weight of passive investments.\n\nY is the market weight of active investments\n\nR^m is the return of the market. R^x and R^y are their respective returns. \n\nIf X+Y = 1\n\nand if R^m = XR^x + YR^y\n\nand if by definition R^m = R^x\n\nThen R^m (1-X)= YR^y\n\nY = 1 - X\n\nR^y = (R^m (1-X))/Y\n\n(1-X)/Y = 1\n\nR^y = R^m\n
Because he wants to include the outliers' effect on wealth distribution.  Median would only focus on those in the normal distribution.  Since outliers' are 100% white, it's an important distinction.\n\nHonestly though, the outliers are just that and their wealth is uncontestable.  There is no mobility there.

>How many lives do you think Microsoft saved by increasing human capacity to use computers?\n\nLol.  You think computers were unusable before DOS?  \n\nYou know he stole DOS from a programmer in Seattle right?  You know that he also backstabbed IBM to make Windows right?  They were paying him to make an OS for them and he just diverted the funds to Windows.  You know the guy was tried and found guilty of anti-trust violations in the 90s right?  You know that was the reason he stepped down from Microsoft essentially right?  Because he was such a narcissistic, unscrupulous business man that he was a threat to the company.  \n\nThere are so many more influential people in the computer industry.  Wozniak, Torvalds, Jobs, Xerox, Berners-Lee, Dr. Roberts, etc. Bill Gates is one of the least on the list because he never did anything original other than be on a team with Paul Allen that wrote BASIC.  After that it was mostly backstabbing and unscrupulous business dealings that lead to success. 
You could probably use that excuse with Trump in this situation if he weren't such a loudmouth. I don't buy it. He chose those people just like Trump. He was not a victim even though he was incompetent enough to seem like one. 
Historically, small caps have outperformed. Mid caps have outperformed large caps.  Historically it is true that returns should be greater but volatility is greater as well. 
It is absolutely a circus while the GOP in congress and his appointees tear down the agencies he appointed them to. 
Past gains do not guarantee future returns.  But yeah, there's no reason to take that assumption.  It's one of those things where it's extremely unlikely and you're likely fucked anyway. 
I just haven't had the same experience.  I can't think of one physician I've met that I would classify as humble.  They are very condescending and most are actually the type that get semi-annoyed when they realize you might actually be about as sharp as them.  I live in the South though, so I feel like people in general are just shitty here so maybe that's it.

Bill Gates has also accumulated more wealth during that time.  An obscene amount in fact.  So much that without the charitable donations it probably would be costly and difficult for him to keep enough liquidity to pay the bills.  So he does this to manage his tax burdens mostly.  When you have that much wealth, it's about all you can do.  \n\nSo let's hear a round of applause for the American government for encouraging such good behavior. 
I don't know but did you know Steve Jobs was a terrible person and if you compared him and Bill Gates side by side, your fucking head would go so far up your ass you would disappear. 
Have defaults on sub-prime mortgages been priced in?  I'm assuming we learned our lesson from last time. 
We need to destroy the DNC and become one of the two options.  The DNC might as well be the GOP except slightly less ludicrous right now.  They are centrists. We need real social change.

I know you're highly self-aware and don't take this shit seriously at all, but when you see someone who has a shitty post that doesn't make any sense when you break down the logic of it, and is usually a poorly-disguised bad-mouthing of the opposing opinion, and that's the top post in the thread, followed by three or four down saying the exact same thing, with the same kind of shitty logic, but they aren't even really responding to each other you know?  Like their kinda just repeating the same canned shit-talk with slightly different words, you know there's some shilling going on.  You can go into certain threads and immediately tell if it's being shilled.  
I'm debt free.  I wouldn't mind it. 
It's easier to tell you what to stay away from than what to get because for the most part it's all pretty good their.  Although I will give a special nod to their dairy which is amazing, especially the plain greek yogurt. \n\nStay away from processed prepackaged foods.  I have found them to be mostly disgusting there.  Things like their frozen dinners and refrigerated pizzas and such.  It's better if you stick to simple things while you're there.  \n\nOther than that their selection can be lacking in some areas.  But you'll figure that out from shopping there.  
>especially with momentum on our side. \n\nLol, losing everything means we have momentum on our side?  How do you figure that one? 
You have to tax businesses on some level or you create corporate tax shelters. 
The fear here is based on the assumption that the DNC somehow represents anyone at this point in time.  It does not.  It is an ineffectual and weak organization completely incompetent of representing the interests of anyone in America.  A third-party that truly represented the disenfranchised and progressives in America could destroy the DNC and become the second option to GOP propaganda machine.  We should not fear or concede to an organization that lost so thoroughly when the win was theirs for the taking in the last cycle.  The DNC shot itself in the foot and we should put them out of their misery rather than reluctantly limp on with them. 
>A debate about income inequality is probably not going to involve Fed monetary policy as a root cause.\n\nI don't see why it wouldn't.  Our over-reliance on monetary policy ties directly to the rapid increase in inequality we've seen.  Monetary policy by its very nature always favors the "house," so to speak, because it manages debt consumption.  Debt is the primary mechanism of generating inequality.  When the economy is good, the wealthy will have proportionately more money to save and take advantage of high rates.  Likewise, you could see how a lowly worker may think that is the best time to take out a loan, because they are getting paid you know.  They can actually pay it back!  When the economy is bad, the wealthy will have credit to take advantage of cheap debt.  While the lowly worker will be unemployed, recently defaulted and unable to find a cosigner.  By this pattern and if you imagine extremes on either end, you can see how monetary policy erodes the bottom and engorges the top.  The rich are simply more solvent and liquid in the debt cycle. \n\nFurthermore, unless you have some counter-acting force, there is no redistribution inherent in monetary policy, and runaway inequality is an inherent part of capitalism.  There's a reason it's not called laborism after all.  All that is to say, that we no longer have a functional fiscal policy anymore, which along with monetary policy, is an important part of economic regulation. 
You need to re-investigate his presidency then and particularly Iraq and all the information surrounding it. It is the greatest scandal ever perpetrated on our country. His advisors were just as corrupt as Trump's. 
Player Piano is a good book but it is not really Vonnegut at his best.  It was one of his first books I believe.  I think Asimov is much more insightful on the whole automation thing.   I guess that should be obvious though since that's all Asimov wrote about.

Before the invasion can begin, all of Utaria's troops must be supplied.  Their million-strong army has put a severe strain on their hosts railway and port systems.  When the order for the invasion is given, all available armies must immediately attack, lest the enemy catch wind of their plans.\n\nThe Shock corps are assumed to have been given priority, and they will be fully supplied.\n\nFor each of the ten regular armies, there will be a 10% chance they are not ready, represented by rolling a one.\n\n+/u/rollme [[10d10]]

So... no opinion on what the troops should do?  Do they just sit there and watch the Utarians walk past?

So if I get what you're saying, you think there is no real choice between political parties in the United States, because the left and the right in the US would be considered the right and the very right in Europe, and because in NYC tiny local parties with no chance of winning the presidential election instead use fusion voting to endorse candidates from parties who do have a chance?\n\nThen I could just go ahead and say, as an insider looking out, that it's actually *you* who has no choice and lives in a one-party state, because you don't have a left and a right to choose from.  All you have is a left and an even further left.

Why is the second half crossed out?  What do you want your men there to do?
There is no question that 305,000 men can defeat 10,000.  The question is, how many of the Utarians can the UAS defenders take out before they are forced out?\n\nFirst, the efficacy of the DDNETP defenses must be determined.\n\n1: The walls of the city, for one reason or another, are not significantly harmed by the Utarian artillery.\n\n2-7:  The walls of the city are damaged by a heavy salvo of Utarian artillery.  There are enough gaps for Utarian infantrymen to assault the city if they so choose.\n\n8-10:  The advanced Utarian artillery reduces the city walls to rubble, allowing thousands of Utarians to walk right in.\n\n[[d10]]\n\nNext, the loyalty of the citizens must be determined.\n\n1-2:  The citizens by and large consider the Utarian invasion to be unwarranted agression, and side firmly with the UAS.  Many of them will take up arms against the invaders.\n\n3-9:  The citizens are of average loyalty.  On the whole they will not impede or assist the defenders, but they will tolerate conscription in moderate numbers.\n\n10:  The citizens, tired of living under the UAS boot, yearn for freedom, and view the Utarians as liberators.  They will actively assist the invaders.\n\n[[d10]]\n\n+/u/rollme
If they can't recognize it, then it's obviously not that obvious.
I messed that roll up slightly, but the actual random number is what's important.\n\n/u/LifeBeyondLiving your northern army takes 11% casualties and your southern army takes 9% casualties.  The element of surprise is lost and you failed to crush the defenders you met in the first few hours of the war.  However, it *has* only been a few mere hours, and your numbers are great, so you can afford to renew your attack immediately if you choose.\n\n/u/matasaga you've lost about ~~10,000~~ **5,000** men in the opening hours of the war, but your lines are holding.  You can choose to try and continue to hold your position, or you can retreat.  There will most likely be no time for reinforcements to arrive before Utaria attack again. (and their other armies begin their attack on other fronts)  However your government is now fully aware of the situation and can begin to raise more troops.\n\nEdit:  Got my math a bit wrong, revised casualties.
I didn't realize the Bi-Levels were still in production, I guess I assumed Bombardier was only offering Multi-Levels.  That's neat!
Wait I think I'm missing something... how is that layout supposed to fit into that space?
>  There will most likely be no time for reinforcements to arrive before Utaria attack again.\n\nThis will be true unless LBL for whatever reason decides not to immediately press his attack.  I'm talking a matter of hours.  Raising an army of 350K will likely take take at the very least a few weeks.
It's so weird seeing the UI, which looked good then and still does now, next to the hideous 2004 graphics.
According to the spreadsheet, your standing army is 100K.  The 180K I gave you instead was generous.  It will take you some time to gather 290K more troops, and your country will be severely penalized if you raise more than 470K.  The choice is yours, but I'd strongly recommend against it.

I wouldn't recommend storing a layout vertically.  I don't think it would be practical, since there are always places where the glue won't quite hold.\n\nIf you're sure you want to do it though, why not just laminate a few sheets of foam insulation board together?  It would be very light which is important, and it should be reasonably sturdy.  You could then just set it up on the sawhorses when you want to run trains.
I didn't realize we were arguing parliamentary vs 2-party.  I've heard it all before, I know 2-party is shit, I don't need to hear it again.  But 2-party is a far cry from 1-party.  2-party is fewer choices, not no choice.\n\n> And there are right wing parties in the rest of the world, but they don't get nearly as far or as popular if they spew republican sounding shit.\n\nThis is because many people in America hold political views that differ from the views many people in Canada and Europe hold.  It has nothing to do with the election system.

/u/matasaga since you've failed to deliver a defense plan in the 24 hours allotted,  [I've prepared a plan for you.](http://i.imgur.com/SD3fbEn.png)\n\nYou currently have 180,000 active troops stationed defensively.  You have not been at war recently and have never been at war in the industrial era, so your equipment and training are somewhat outdated, but your country has industrialized, so you are capable of fielding a reasonably modern force.
> Its is almost the same as the American system, you do get a choice of who to vote for, it's just that your choices represent different factions of the same party vs the factions being split into 2 parties that alternate control.\n\nFor that to be true of the American system, there would have to be two identical parties.  The two parties we do have are most certainly *not* the same.  I have no clue where you got the idea that they are.  Just because they are more conservative overall than parties in places like Canada and Europe does not mean we have the choice only between conservatives- things are not so black and white.  Our liberals may be conservative by your standards, but they're still liberals.\n\nFurthermore the insinuation that the Republican and Democrat parties are two faces of the same organization is frankly preposterous.  It makes me think you either don't know what you're talking about, or you're some conspiracy theorist nut.  I'll bet you're going to tell me that the Democrats and Republicans are both puppets of the Illuminati.\n\n> do you really think those opinions cause your politicians or is it the other way around?\n\nOh right and there's also a mind control conspiracy to tell the voters what to think.
I think that until we are willing to provide reasonable mental health care in this country, we should also just shut the fuck up about mass-shootings.
/u/LifeBeyondLiving you have succeeded in breaking through the UAS lines in the north and the south.  Your 1st Shock Corps is now 163,309 strong, while your 2nd Shock Corps is now 106,652 strong.\n\n/u/Matasaga your border defenses have been destroyed in both the north and the south.  In the south you missed your chance to withdraw, and your troops were completely routed.  Only 17,750 men escaped the slaughter, and they scattered into the countryside.  They can be regrouped, but their morale is low.  However, in the north, your commanders managed to preserve most of their forces, and 32,900 men are falling back to Port iz Kajtr.
That little strip of land really is a mess isn't it.
Those two in the first picture look unrealistic.  The one in the second picture is realistic.
My mistake, I meant 40000 not 4000.
I really like the headlight, but why is the grill so sparse?  That filter thing is pretty ugly.
I'm sorry I'm not the expert you seem to be, no need to be a dick about it.
Parliamentary actually *isn't* generally first past the post.  First past the post is a system that is mainly used in the United States, United Kingdom and some of their former colonies.\n\nYou do realize people can disagree within parties, right?  There are not just two choices.  For example some democrats are in favor of certain socialist policies, some aren't.  That's where the primary elections come in.  Plus, the president and the federal legislatures are only one part of the government.  Independents and 3rd party candidates can and do win elections at lower levels of government.  Not often, sure, but the main thing stopping them is their lack of popularity, not the system.  Maybe if third party candidates were regularly winning large portions of the positions at the local-state levels, yet were inexplicably absent at the Federal level, I'd start to be concerned that I don't live in an open democracy.\n\nI've said it several times already, and I'll say it one last time.  I strongly agree that the American system is far from perfect.  I strongly disagree with the notion that the American system is even remotely as bad as the Chinese system.  I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.\n\n
You sure can, as long as everything is code 83 I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't match up.

Most of the yards are still in place, but the companies themselves have consolidated a great deal.  Only Kansas City Southern, BNSF, and Union Pacific are left.  Kansas City is still a very important railroad hub, but its importance has lessened compared to Chicago since Chicago is an interchange point between the western, eastern, and Canadian railroads.

~~/u/LifeBeyondLiving in Port iz Kajtr and G Gemeia your marines take about 1000 casualties each, but they have managed to push into the city centers.  The fighting is fierce and could go either way.~~\n\n~~In Nogsolm your troops have failed to push into the city, but they have secured a beachhead and can try making a second push if they are reinforced.  You lost only 780 men.~~\n\n~~/u/Matasaga Utarian troops have made amphibious assaults of three of your cities.  In Port iz Kajtr and G Gemeia Utaria the invaders have managed to push into the city, but in a stroke of luck they have been held off outside of the city at your capital of Nogsolm.~~\n\n~~At Port iz Kajtr and G Gemeia each you lost 1400 men, while at Nogsolm you lost 900.~~\n\nDue to a misunderstanding, this section of the battle is no longer canon.\n
I'd try using temporary dirt roads as guides to place the yard tracks in straighter, more parallel lines, and that ground texture painter mod to give the yard area a more industrial surface than grass.
On the other hand, in theory charging for express lanes could help recoup the expenses from construction, or go towards maintaining the road, or help pay for future roads, allowing less tax money to be spent than would otherwise be needed... just saying...
All right fine we'll give you a chance.  Let's go with the shipyard.
You may only need it once every two years, but it'll make you look cool every day!
"How dare you not sell me weed. Weed is a human right. You're a shitlord crack dealer, you bastard. Don't give me economics lessons, I need a joint!"\n\nI swear this thread is straight out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
By my calculations, he lost over $5,000. Because he didn't make a hypothetical sale. SAD. Someone needs to learn that selling weed is NOT A FOR-PROFIT VENTURE. You take on all that risk and exposure for the good of humanity, goddamn it. If you're on your last 3g that doesn't give you the right to not sell someone 1g for a normal price. You HAVE to sell because they need it. Waaaa
You haven't been to Boston I take it.
The first engagements of the war will be the two shock corps of Utaria attempting to break through the UAS defensive lines.\n\nThe 1st Shock Corps, 183K strong, has to break through a defensive line manned by 40K UAS troops south of Fajlzbrintr.  These troops are stretched relatively thinly, but due to scouting in familiar terrain they have an edge in that they can redeploy troops along the line as necessary to counter any threat.  The troops were not aware of the invasion before it began, as no official declaration of war was made, but scouts spotted the invading army a few hours before it reached the line.  30,000 UAS troops were able to be moved into the area where the main Utarian advance would be made.\n\nOnce they reached the line, the Utarian army began to make infantry assaults and cavalry charges against the enemy positions, supported by heavy artillery fire.  They will attempt to break through the line, splitting it in half and enabling them to surround the UAS troops.\n\n+/u/rollme [[1d10]]\n\n1-3: The Utarians are repelled in their first attack by superior UAS cover.\n\n4-7: The Utarians make a small breakthrough, but do not rout the UAS troops.\n\n8-10: The Utarians make a large breakthrough, shattering the UAS troops.\n\nThe story of the 2nd Shock Corps in the north is similar, but their numbers are fewer, and the 40K UAS troops manning the northern line aren't spread as thinly.  The terrain is also rougher, giving the defenders a further advantage.  35K UAS troops are positioned in time to repel the initial attack.\n\n+/u/rollme [[1d10]]\n\n1-4: The Utarians are repelled in their first attack by superior UAS cover.\n\n5-9: The Utarians make a small breakthrough, but do not rout the UAS troops.\n\n10: The Utarians make a large breakthrough, shattering the UAS troops
The final part of the initial phase of the Utarian invasion plan are the march of the infantry armies.\n\n/u/Matasaga \n\n366,000 infantrymen of the first, second, third, and fourth Utarian infantry armies are marching towards Mag, where you have 30,000 men.  What do your men do?\n\nAt the same time, 305,000 infantrymen of the sixth through tenth Utarian infantry armies are beginning their march south towards DDNETP, where you have a mere 10,000 troops.  Note that if Port iz Kajtr falls to Utaria, these troops will be surrounded.  What do these men do? 
Now that he's left CP for CSX, is CP going to return to the way it was?  :P  It'd probably be for the best... poor CSX...
Again, Parliamentary vs. 2-party.  I get it, Parliamentary is better, first past the post sucks, you're beating a dead horse.  I know the American election system is far from perfect.\n\nWhat I have a problem with is the notion that the two sides of the Chinese Communist party is the same as the two current parties in the American system, and that the American system is completely different from the Parliamentary system.  Even in the Parliamentary system, there's still just conservative and liberal, right?  There's no third or fourth direction I haven't heard of?  The views candidates can have in the US varies pretty widely, that's why we have the party primary elections.
On the bright side, they could just look through their telescopes to see what the other guys were doing, and copy them.
It would technically be hard*er* for N scale locomotives to maintain contact, but still not hard.  N scale really isn't all that small, especially compared to Z scale or T (!) scale.  It's not difficult to keep them clean.
A less flattering picture really could not have been picked.
I'll do those later, probably tomorrow.
The Utarian Shock armies press their assault!  A second salvo of artillery, even heavier than before, tears through the UAS defenses.  Now fully aware of UAS troop positions, the Utarians can leverage their superior numbers to surround their enemies.\n\n1-2: Miraculously, the Utarians still manage to fail to unseat the UAS troops, although the latter takes much heavier casualties than the former.\n\n3-4:  Unsurprisingly, the Utarians defeat the UAS troops, but not decisively.  The UAS takes heavy casualties, and are forced to abandon their positions, making a controlled retreat to Fajlbrintr in the south and Port Iz Kajtr in the north.\n\n5-9:  The UAS commanders missed their chance to make a fighting withdrawal from the battle while the Utarians regrouped.  Their troops are routed and scatter into the countryside.  Large numbers are captured or killed.\n\n10:  The Utarians completely wipe out the UAS defenders.  The UAS troops find themselves encircled by Utarian cavalry and have no choice but to surrender.\n\n+/u/rollme [[2d10]]  (1 south, 2 north)

Doesn't matter, still brickweed.
Yes, as a liberal that is something I want to back up. Obama did what he did, and I will not pretend he was a great president with all the bullshit he pulled. 
That won't happen either. People will walk quietly into the dark with him.
Haha that's awesome. Hope nobody got hurt
But I think that Daddy-daughter events shouldn't be Daddy showing daughter how a guy (who will be sexually interested in her) should be treating her, because that is literally the father playing the role of a guy who wants to fuck his daughter. It's disgusting. Just take your daughter bowling, and have fun, and let her have fun. Don't stick her in a dress and confuse her, fuck.
How about if he doesn't want a baby, but she does? Should he be able to reject parental responsibility on the grounds that she's making the decision without him?
I literally have nothing to say to you. Enjoy your day. Or don't. I'm not your doctor.

Misguided doesn't mean your actions are accidental, it means they are being guided badly for some reason or another. That's exactly how I would describe the situation. Anyone who takes advice from the old fucks who advised GWB is misguided. Anyone who thinks they hear God's voice is deeply, deeply misguided.\n\nMisguided fits. George Bush was misguided his whole life, so he misguided a nation into some very misguided situations. What he didn't ever do was blame Islam or Muslims in general for the things that *radical islamic terrorists* (a fitting term for terrorists of the Islamic radical variety, who mostly terrorize Muslims who aren't radical).\n\nPeople are like trees. If they're crooked, it's because they grew up in harsh conditions. Blaming them for being crooked doesn't protect new ones from the wind. (Don't tell me Donald Trump grew up in optimal conditions - I wouldn't trade my childhood for his and a million dollars)
Hopefully they won't note that we were complicit. Hopefully. Maybe they will forget.
If you're not driving a tank, don't hit a fucking moose. - Canada
They absolutely are. I'd love to see the percentage of people in those protests who would mention Goldman Sachs as one of their gripes beside "Trump is a racist" and "I just don't get people who don't like people because of what they look like" and "Trump hates women"\n\nI see a lot of people who argue against Trump that I like, and a lot that I don't like. I also see plenty of each arguing for Trump. There are educated people on both sides. I dislike authoritarian autocratic leaders, but I also can't subscribe to the protestors view of the world. Trump is fucking up a lot of things, it's awful. It's hard to watch. But seeing the reaction of the left, how it's all emotional and victim-y.. it's gross. The left should be brushing off its defeat, reorganizing, figuring out why it lost, and learning to embrace grassroots campaigns and people's issues (that come from more than just minorities). But I don't know, it doesn't look like that to me.
> I do know that he is fucked, because he was in an accident with a cop.\n\nEspecially being elderly, that probably isn't true. Plenty of cops understand. Accidents are accidents, not attempts on your life.
No, they don't. They can quit their job and move out of reach. But they don't, because they choose to continue being the cash cow.
Hey, that's racist. You're saying only German cars are worth stealing!
But he didn't say it was user error. He said it was calculated risk. Which it is. You've calculated the risk at around .01%.\n\nHe's just saying "You took that risk"\n\nAnd you *seem* to be saying "It's not your fault"\n\nBut nobody's blaming anyone. It's a consequence, not a punishment.
Ah, so he was the head of the Department of Latin America. \n\nIt's good that we have people overseeing those countries.
Your mother will kill your father. You still have time to save him from her.
I think they should step out of the way and let us all fight until we're all bloody and tired and we've more or less worked things out
What is with all the people killing birds
Haha thank you for that! xD\nThat is exactly what most men do. They just take it in the ass. If the state takes the bitch's side, remember that you're a man, and move your ass somewhere else. The bitch is not going to follow you, she's going to have to get a job and cry. And THAT is what makes any hardship worth it.
No, the same clever rich people who are belly-laughing right now about how everyone hates Trump, and people who voted for Trump, are also lmfao'ing over the implosion of the Democratic Party, and how conservatives talk down liberals as if they are the less educated group.\n\nThose clever, clever rich people are laughing all the way to the bank. Except for the ones who are already there. With them the laughter is damn near Satanic levels.\n\nThe people turning us all against one another are having a great time right now, unlike Trump and his "people".
Maybe we should do compatibility readings. Someone should voyage to Jupiter to gather samples. We'll need funding.
In America, you are not required to drive an automobile. You therefore are not required to have a driver's license. If you are required to have a driver's license to vote, then it's really a *voting* & driving license, and would be required by the United States Constitution to be free, because the US Constitution prohibits any form of financial burden (poll tax) to exercise the right to vote.\n\nI agree that there should be an ID requirement to vote. But because I believe in the US Constitution, I believe that ID should be issued free of charge upon confirmation of identity. It should simply be a national ID card with the bare minimum of information on it, that is good ONLY as a photo ID, not anything else. \n\n> Driver's licenses cost money because they help pay for the state's needs.\n\nIrrelevant. There must be no fee to be paid, ever, to exercise the right to vote. American up. Understand our Constitution and our Rights, or get the fuck out of our country.

We should start a massive gofundme project to build a public fiberoptic network for all of Canada that would be owned and maintained by the Canadian Library Association or something.

Nope! I deny what you said, but I do not refuse it, because that wouldn't make any sense.\n\nThey are nearly identical, but have, through the course of history, taken slightly different, and in both cases multiple, roles.
Apparently by exercising his 1st Amendment right to bitch and complain and dismiss everything they say about him? I think it's too early to make that call
This is why I 100% reject anyone's notion that Trump has had the "good life". He's had money, fame, and hot tubs parties with models, but he's been trapped in a sad, ugly cage his whole life. I feel bad for him, and I hope we can get him out of the White House before they destroy each other (Trump and the House).
Nah, punish the team by removing their best player, and putting Mr. Fake Injury in their place.

Yes, but vote for who?\n\nThe party whose plan is to let Big Fingers have his way with the country, because they like his way? Or the party whose plan is to double-down on the same technique that lost them this election, who are seriously considering abandoning campaigning in rural America, because all rural America does for them is send massive grassroots movements with millions of active youth fighting for change (which they aren't interested in)?\n\nCome Midterms, the Democrats are going to put their foot down on the brakes expecting an end to the shitshow, and find out their brakes gave up on them and left.
Doesn't matter. It was automatic assault ammo.
I may be incorrect here, but I'm pretty sure the ban did not include "religious minorities" from those countries.\nAs I understood, this was the reason it was found unconstitutional in the first place - it included a religious test (are you not Muslim) to be able to enter the USA - if you were from those countries. \n\nIt was absolutely a Muslim ban - it simply was not an All Muslim ban (as many Trump supporters are quick to note, most Muslims don't live in those countries). It was a ban on Muslims from those countries. Totally illegal.
Let's get this one up there, sanity
And do you also believe that men who don't want to be fathers should be able to abandon financial/parental responsibility before the baby is born, if the mother wants to keep it but the father doesn't want it?
So-called "experts" lose every time. Alternative facts are winning. It's true.
Hell, I do it just so that I never have to feel an undignified rage towards someone who won't sell me weed for a ridiculously low price. The way I see it, they should be selling me weed for the cost of electricity and overhead and labour in *growing* and *distributing* the weed, nothing higher. I don't see why anyone should use such a ridiculous, anti-free-market concept as "supply and demand" to set their prices. Why do people think they're entitled to profit while others don't have weed? It's ridiculous. The dealers feel entitled to earn money for their work. \n\nGrow your own, people. The dealers want money.
> That isn't based in reality and the more that take that road the harder compromise becomes.\n\nAnd if compromise becomes too difficult, it will stop happening.
Agree 100%. Us reasonable, informed Canadians fall all across the political board, just like Americans, and we stand with our American friends. Our liberals stand with our liberal American friends, our conservatives stand with our conservative American friends, and our tired workers are exhausted with all this bullshit fighting with no compromise, just like our tired American friends.

Dude I don't think you realized my post was almost pure sarcasm. I'm with you on all points. \n\nI grow it myself so I don't have to feel ripped off by my friends who deal or the dispensaries.\n\nUm, seriously, I put a big "Waaaaa" at the end of my post, like, someone all mad because the weed costs too much and they don't understand supply/demand.
This is why even though I have suicidal thoughts sometimes, and I feel actually much more homicidal than suicidal, I will never tell my doctor or go for any psych anything.\n\nIf I ever do end up murdering people, at least the doctors will sleep easy
Is his wife still alive? I hope not
A boarder is someone who is paying rent/board. The US and Mexico share a border.\n\nAlso, those aren't countries. They're states.
And plenty of dealers have a cut off amount where they don't want to sell anymore because their own supply is so small and they don't want to be dankrupt and mess up their own sleeping. Then some kid goes through half the city looking for weed until they find you, and implore you to sell them weed, while you yourself are really low on weed. Then you say "fine, fuck, because I'm a good stoner, I'll give you someone nobody else here has, an opportunity to buy weed. But it'll be bloody expensive, because it's coming from my own stash. AND, I don't know you.\n\nFWIW, I don't deal. But I understand supply and demand. So I grow my own weed and I pay myself nothing for it.
What outrage? Obsession? Are you writing a novel?
I've been to New Jersey ONE TIME and I saw a bloodied arm laying on the shoulder of the Interstate. Fuck New Jersey
> An argument of ''Bad guys can get guns anyways'' is bullshit\n\nSure it is. The 2nd amendment is about ensuring that federal/state governments are never able to send men with guns around gathering people up for questionable reasons without facing an armed and dangerous public. \n\nThe public may not be as armed or as dangerous as the governments, but it was the opinion of America's founders that it should never be forced to give up its weapons. Nobody should. Respect begins with the other guy's ability to kill you if you fuck with his life.\n\nPolitics, obviously, are way more important to the preservation of liberty and of a just society and government, but, politics failing and institutions falling into the hands of sociopaths intent on molding society into what they see fit, it's much better to know you can at least *try* to kill them if they come for you.\n\nI'd argue that it is the left, right now, and not the right, who actually fears that the federal government, and its institutions, are falling into the hands of sociopaths. It's absolutely delicious to watch them protest en masse while still justifying an anti-gun stance. It's bizarre. Which is what I thrive on. Absurdity. 
So why attach civil rights to it? It's absolutely untenable in America, so why not drop that particular goal, in favor of the others?\n\nDo you really think Democrats are in a position to make outlandish demands right now? Gun control isn't going to happen. So make universal health care happen in a country full of guns. Make civil rights respected and enforced in a country full of guns. Come to terms with the fact that you live in a country full of guns, and fight for what is right, but maybe exclude a battle that you will not win, that a solid chunk of independents and liberals are NOT with you on.
I think most of the people who lost out in that were the people who panicked and sold when everything had crashed. You don't sell low. You buy, because it's on sale.
Please, please for your father's sake report your mother's abuse. Nobody should have to take that. If she won't even work, then she's doing nothing for him, only harming him.

I don't think it is so much the worry that the pendulum won't swing back so much as the somber observation that the pendulum is gaining steam with each swing. The frame it's swinging in was built in the 18th century, and most of the world is beginning to have serious and reasonable concerns about whether it can contain the pendulum, and whether or not we have any control over it's swings.
Is Trump stupid enough to win the US Presidential Election?\n\nAhhh fuck, you're right.
You could also *refuse* the sliders.
An incredibly stupid sentiment to feel, considering you would have absolutely no problems and absolutely no complaints or regrets if you simply did not exist. Parents have a duty to raise children right and give them the best step up in life that they can - don't want to do that? Don't have kids. It's simple. You do not have kids to use them. Anyone who does should be locked away for any crime they commit.

"Analysis suggests that the microbes may have been tucked away in these tiny time capsules for 10,000 to 50,000 years and may have been dormant for some or all of that time.

Yes.
You do it. I couldn't care less anymore.
> Abortion, Marriage and Weed have never been used by a big gigantic asshole to kill a bunch of kids.\n\nIs the irony lost on you, that many millions of people do in fact believe that abortion is used by assholes to kill kids? Not saying I agree with them, but your statement *does* ignore the other side's argument.\n\nAbortion kills far, far more developing Homo sapiens than guns do.
Did it? I thought this election proved that you still have to pay attention to rural populations... a lesson the Democrats did not learn, and are actively doubling down on not believing right now.
And on the other other hand, I think men have the right to choose too (not what happens with the woman's body, but whether or not they will accept responsibility for a child, if the pregnant woman wants it.\n\nBut so far as I've seen, the left/right/men/women sure as fuck don't think we have that right.\n\nSo, over the last year or so I've given up entirely on the abortion issue. Let them ban it altogether, let there be protesting and war scenes in the street, idgaf anymore
I guess that depends on who you ask, as always
You ignorant fool, the guy above simply did not realize that it was indeed based upon religion, because it left out "religious minorities" from those countries. It was a ban on only Muslims, from those countries.\n\nConceited outrage.. wtf is wrong with you Reddit

Yeah, I don't think that has much to do with feminism. I think it's disgusting too. "Using the language of an adult sexual relationship" seems to me to be exactly what it is doing, and it's totally unnecessary. Want to take your daughter bowling? Cool. Want to dress her up like she's your romantic interest and *show her how boys should be treating her*? Disgusting. Just tell her how boys should be treating her. Explain it to her. Talk to her. She's not old enough to understand? Well then she's sure as hell not going to understand why you're playing Dating Bowling either.\n\nThe guy writing the piece seems to me to be the Feminist cuckhold type, and the "feminist" opinion sounded like reason to me, there.

Trump has almost always been nice to Putin (even in the context of [Putin killing journalists and political opponents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niQg2PAOm4k)) so on this alone it would seem great for Russia if Trump became president.\n2. Trump has [personal connections to Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeaKeyQSYlU) and has even [asked Russia to interfere with the US elections](http://www.salon.com/2016/12/12/donald-trumps-russia-hacking-denials-ignore-that-he-asked-russia-to-hack-hillary-clinton/). I mean, how more crazy could this be?\n3. [Trump has financial ties to Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-paul-manafort-ukraine-russia-putin-ties) of which we, as far as I'm informed, know very little about.\n\nEDIT: Here is some more great argumentation on why I believe the ties to Russia and the hacking is true. This argumentation does not base on the information from the intelligence agencies (which could be false as it was on the WMD in Iraq) but on logical reasoning: [The Young Turks - Do The Russians Have Dirt On Trump?](https://youtu.be/PV0SJo8Z0Cw)\n\n> *Rex Tillerson is the evidence. So you are wondering "How do you know he worked with the Russians?". The Russians had a 500 billion dollar deal with Exxonmobil. The sanctions that Obama put into place ended that half a trillion dollar deal.* \n\n> *Now, the idea of picking the Exxonmobil CEO as Secretary of State is so weird, out of place, out of the ordinairy. It doesn't make any sense. If you would have put him as, for example, Secretary of Treasury, that would make more sense because he is a business person and maybe he can help there. Secretary of Commerce... maybe you really wanted to screw over workers with Secretary of Labour ...but Secretary of State?*\n\n> *Secretary of State is "thank you Russia we really apprecite your help, so in return we will give you your favorite person. The guy who runs Russias largest oil company says because of the sanctions he is banned from america, he says his main wish is to come back and run motorcycles on our high ways with Rex Tillerson. He said that before the election.*\n\n> *So when you give the guy who has the half a trillion dollar contract with Putin, and who Putin has given a meadal to, the position of Secretary of State when he has no qualifications and no one would have ever thought of that, that is your evidence that that is a gigant thank you gift to the Russians who clearly helped you.*\n\n> — Cenk Uygur, The Young Turks\n\nP.S.  \nI am no former Clinton supporter and actually think the leaks were great for transparency of the election and that Clinton should've lead the polls by a margin enough to take the Comey incident.

It's not an objective fact. I don't know if you are a member or how much you watch but it's more complicated like that. Yes they thought Hillary had a pretty good chance of winning since polling 3 days earlier showed Hillary winning with 4 percent which is quite significant. However, due to the fact that some who voted for Trump hadn't voted before and that the statistical model of the study did not expect them, the poll got it wrong. TYT has always listened polls unlike [outlets like Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-probability-clinton-winning_us_581d0399e4b0e80b02ca2498) and since the poll changed so did their prediction but the prediction was always that this was gonna be a narrow election. Any other prediction is just on pure guess and is as valuable as anyone else's guess. TYT were one of the few who read the polls, saw that Trump had an excellent chance and sounded the alarm. Here is a [summary of their opinions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhjp3hDIJQ) after the election.\n\nI would make an educated guess that you didn't follow all their coverage the last weeks up to the election. They were pretty nervous the week before the election before the "Hillary is leading 4%"-poll.\n\n> I remember someone very smugly saying Trump had no combination of states he could win that would result in victory\n\nI would like you to show me that.\n\n> Trump has no PATH to victory in this election"? or was that like CNN or one of the other big companies\n\nMost certainly not TYT since they were famous as the ones who warned and predicted that Trump had an excellent chance of winning.

Media was unnecessarily thorough in covering Trump's scandals  and shenanigans (of which he only has himself to blame) 24/7 while practically not at all reporting on Clinton's shady business and almost ignoring Sanders huge crowds and support.\n\nTrump got a heck of a lot of free advertisement from the media while Sanders got almost none. Trump gained, in some estimates, billions of dollars worth of free ads and I'll make an educated guess that Sanders weren't even close to that.

To all the people saying that nothing will change and Bernie will be ignored; the establishment's policies are unpopular and the only way they have passed is due to the fact that they go unnoticed. \n\nBernie has a huge base and is a popular senator with policies that a majority support.

> Or would both the Republicans and the Democrats have done everything they could to turn him into an ineffectual president so that they could say "*See, America?

That plus the fact that Sanders said that if the Republicans and Democrats tried to stop him implementing single-payer or what-not, he was gonna very publicly point out who they are so people can take action.\n\nBut I agree, this situation is a hell of a lot better than if Sanders and other progressives wouldn't have gotten the attention they have these past one and a half years so we have to thank Sanders for that as well. These coming four years of Trump are gonna be meticulously watched over by a huge movement.

For example, I don't agree with Michael Shure but I think he is a great counterpart to Jimmy Dore.

Bernie has a great philosophy that people should adopt: If someone that obviously does not work towards your goals support one of your positions, you should support that candidate and hold their feet to the fire when push comes to shove. Because if that person follows through then it's a win and if they won't keep their promises it's a win in the public eye. This does not mean that one has to drop out but being against someone just because not all the opinions align is counter productive.\n\nI wouldn't trust Cuomo but if we push and pressure him in the public spotlight enough he can't back down or the progressives will be furious. Either way, we are gonna replace old politicians with progressive ones.

I agree with Bernie that there was no rigging of the primary *but* the establishment had it's thumb on the scale with late and few debates which prevented candidates with less name recognition, as well as weird 6 months rules preventing new members of the Democratic party to vote in New York and so on. That is not a rigged elecion but an unfair and unnecessarily complicated one designed to let the established one win.
I really like to hear liberal/progressive opinions and their network is the place to go. They usually cover their stories well and give relevant background to them as well. Although they might be wrong sometimes (as everybody), the over all give, in my opinion, the full picture and a great analysis. My favorite example of this is probably [their prediction of the 2016 election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhjp3hDIJQ).
Eskalering fungerar mycket dåligt. Något makthavarna borde gjort för länge sedan är att lyssna på forskarna och ta lärdom av den vetenskap som lagts fram inom ämnet. Till exempel följande ifrån [Hällsten et. al](http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/3/456):\n\n> In this study, we have shown that, for males, around 50–80 per cent of the gap in recorded crime between the children of immigrants and children with a native-Swedish background can be explained by family resources and neighbourhood segregation, without even considering the individuals’ own attainment characteristics (which we avoided, due to their potential endogeneity). For females, the explained proportion of the gap in crime is even larger, and it turns out that we often find no significant difference between females of immigrant and Swedish origin.\n\nFör att minska brottsligheten i dessa områden måste fattiga i Sverige få en bra ekonomisk grund att stå på samt att stadsplaneringen måste minska stadsdelssegregering genom att blanda bostäder som villor, bostadsrätter och hyreslägenheter.

Unfortunately true. Obama is civilized when it comes to his way of expressing himself but when it comes to politics he is a disaster (though most probably not a bigger one than Trump is going to be). Just a few examples; He continued drone-strikes and wars abroad; He ~~repealed~~ failed to restore [Habeas corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus); He continued the illegal wiretapping; He went after whistle blowers; etc etc. He did some good things too but since he didn't build the Democratic party as president almost his entire legacy will be repealed by Donald Trump.\n\nEDIT: Clarification; I do like Obama but he also could have been MUCH more outspoken on his issues and made sure that the American public knew what obstructionist the Republicans really are. This post is meant to challenge everyones views of him since he and the other corporate Democrats are part of the problem which lead to Donald Trump (hint: establishment politics). [This](http://i.imgur.com/fkLF9.gif) is probably an accurate depiction of my feelings towards him.

I don't think Bernie's stance (as I have [pointed out before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/5mtbss/while_i_know_he_himself_isnt_a_progressive_it_is/dc6bnas/)) necessary collides with demonstrations against Trump. He has already shown who he really is by appointing the entire establishment into his cabinet, something [Bernie has been vocal about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Desu02EK2ck).\n\nProtesting against the path Donald Trump has already taken with his picks does not prevent us from trying to pressure him towards democratic and humane values.\n\nAs Bernie has said; We are gonna support the president to accomplish the goals he laid out to help the middle class but we are gonna vigorously oppose him if he starts to pander to the establishment or racist/bigoted ideals.
Nope. He has repeatedly said he want to comply with the law but since the Espionage Act effectively prevents him to get a fair trial (since it's about secret information he can't speak to a jury) he'd rather not be sentenced 35 years (!!!) and tortured. The justice system should take into account that the leaks had relevance to the public discourse and therefore lowering punishment to encourage transparency and to prohibit a government going rouge while still discouraging leaking secret information.\n\nA wise guy, really.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to point out; When your are torturing whistle blowers, to the point where they are trying to commit suicide, who uncover war crimes (!!!) committed by a government who claims to be the "leader of the free world" (which is becoming more and more laughable as the days go on so to speak) you have got to realize that it's not the way to go. Being patriotic here is doing what Snowden and Manning did cause they want to see USA actually be the leader of the free world and help people making an informed desicion. That's what I'm getting at.\n\nEDIT 2: Technically, yes, it's evading the law. However, understandably the law is seriously broken in the US giving him no fair trial if he ever returned.

There is no doubt that vaccines work but as long as vaccines are developed by huge corporations, I will stay critical to them and their products. I still recommend taking vaccines that are proved and tested but when the swine flu was about in 2009 I refused to take the vaccine, got sick, got better and here I am today. As for my peers, who took the vaccine which was not tested enough, they might experience some side effects since the vaccine later was found to cause in some cases [narcolepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy) and the recommendation by the The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden [were later changed to not recommend people under the age of 18 to take the vaccine](http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/nyheter/2011mars/uppdateraderekommendationerompandemrix). Boy, was I glad I skipped that ordeal.\n\nQuick profits and corporate interest behind vaccines are a problem and, in my view, is one of the biggest concerns of so called *anti-vaxxers*. Being skeptical to this fact is good but when independent organizations have tested and tried vaccines to ensure their safety, one has to look at it through another perspective. However, even here there are some problems. So called independent organizations, governmental or not, can be influenced by corruption and even some scientific studies are bought by corporations. This is again a reason why *anti-vaxxers* are skeptical. In short, corruption by Big Pharma is one huge problem that undermines trust.\n\nVaccines, when they are tested and tried, do wonders and prolong our lifespan as well as improve our health. Vaccines which are made in heist by corporations looking to make a buck with an interest of selling more, can be dangerous. Know the difference.\n\n**TL;DR**: For those of you who want to 'combat' anti-vaxxers: Corruption is something that undermines trust in medicine and, in my view, leads to anti-vaxxers who can't believe anything they see.\n\n**To downvoters**: I'm only trying to bring together both sides here to find common ground for a discussion. At least comment and point out problems with my reasoning. But hey, if you want to sit in your echo chamber while parents don't vaccinate their children, fine by me.

Då det var det enda stället dessa ungdomar kunde vända sig till förutom en överfylld lägenhet började de protestera fredligt och sedan eskalerade det till det vi känner till idag. Det som i slutändan stoppade kravallerna var föräldrarna till ungdomarna och inte polisen.\n\nDet här är en mycket kort sammanfattning men [rekommenderar att lyssna på dokumentären](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/333539?programid=2519).\n\n**Sensmoralen:** Vi alla behöver lära oss att respektera varandra. Politikerna gentemot folket och folket gentemot blåljus.
> they went ahead and did whatever the hell they wanted anyway\n\nNot entirely true. Bernie Sanders did not become the candidate and the election process was clearly in Clinton's favor *but* we did get progressive policies in the democratic policy plan so let's not sell ourselves short! We can demand these changes and we have the majority of the population behind us to do it!
From what I have read, it's caused by the vaccine Pandemrix but they think they know why since the Canadian counterpart Arepanrix didn't have the same effect so it must be something specific to Pandemrix. There seems to have been a virus protein in the vaccine similar to one signal substance for some sleep receptor in the brain.\n\nAnyway, I'm not even near schooled enough to discuss details. It was clear that the mass vaccination was rushed too much but it's easy to wise in hindsight.
This should've been it's own post. Next time, go for it, cause this is gold.
I like how the three first minutes is just the crowd cheering for him. I totally [agree with Jimmy Dore](https://youtu.be/XbRGKt2IX5U?t=4m):\n\n> *Do you think he would've got those 13,000 votes in Michigan?  \n> Do you think he would've got those 27,000 votes in Wisconsin?  \n> Do you think there would've been 7 million fewer votes for the democratic nominee this year than there was for Barack Obama in 2008?  \n> ...or do you think he would've crushed in the biggest landslide in electoral history?*  \n> — Jimmy Dore
If one needs to sum the election up in one sentence, this would be the one.
Why is it so hard for people in any hobby to be nice to each other?

And after that they will probably go out and blame Bernie Sanders for damaging her in the primaries...\n\nWe know how this song goes...
[Correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdD9uSrNFT4). In retrospect, he could've been a much better president and I kinda like him even though it felt like a missed opportunity, but at least he kept the US in a stable course to recovery unlike some earlier presidents.

First of all, the [Obama administration is a joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjRKc00_4yM) when it comes to economics.\n\n>While I do want higher taxes for the wealthy (which Sanders wants), I don't want government deciding how a business should be run or exactly how much profit they're allowed to make. That just drives business out of the country.\n\nSecondly. I don't think they should run the corporation but the government has some tools like setting taxes on imported products to make an incentive to keep the production in the US. That way, the government do not get involved in the company and the company has a choice.

Censorship in Sweden is a problem and I was outraged when the shit hit the fan about the police covering up crimes systematically. Another huge issue is the mass surveillance of the swedes that is a human rights issue of great significance. This is why I support the Pirate Party in Sweden which is the only pro-privacy and pro-government-transparency and the only party taking threats to the freedom of the individual in both Sweden and the EU.\n\nHowever, even though I can make a long list of things wrong with Sweden, [we are still one of the best democracies in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index#Democracy_index_by_country_.282014.29). Russia and China are having a harder time and I do wish they would improve in the nearest future.\n\nEDIT: In the strictest sense, this is off-topic
No, please do. I'm Swedish so I need to learn proper English.
The path Russia has taken in recent years does not bode well for [human rights and freedom of speech and press](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32751797). Whether he is responsible or not, Putin has done a lot of questionable things and it is well known that the pillars of democracy in Russia has taken sever damage because of his actions. It is incredible to me that anyone would support him (and don't get me started about Trump).
Thanks for your answer. Downvoting in most forums, as in this one, are reserved for comment that does not contribute to the topic or a respectful discussion. I tried to fulfill both of those with my comment, hence my interest in downvoters concerns.\n\nYes, this might be common knowledge to some people but as in politics, "normal" people are not knee deep in it to make an informed discussion. There is corruption but as you say, it's important to know where. Even I who are interested in how corruption affect politicians are not really well versed in it, so this might be an angle of attack when discussing the topic. \n\n> Anti-vaxxers also do not mind siding with corrupt people like Wakefield, so how is corruption in Big pharma a massive issue for them, but other corruption is fine?\n\nPeople be people, mate. Some are just immune to facts.\n\nEDIT: words.

'Apply cold water to burned area'
Yeah, I thought so but if someone still has this problem maybe this thread can save their day :)
One of the criticism Young Turks had was the weird segway between the comment on the tragic events in France and the sudden change of topic to money in politics. Don't get me wrong. I think money in politics is, along with the environment, the most important question in this election but I think it would've been suitable to talk more about foreign policy at his introduction speech of two reasons. To address the events in France with solutions and to show that Bernie has a complete set of policies and not "just" on money in politics.\n\nIf Bernie can't convince unsure voters that he is a suitable candidate for "commander in chief" then they might feel reluctant to vote for him.

Matt Mercer often says that the GM should talk this over with the players and see if they feel comfortable with it, and if so, you can make them act it out by talking to their characters via the NPC you are controlling. \n\nFor example; if they encounter an NPC, the GM can say that "the old man turns towards you and asks: 'What are you doing in this village?'" and then the player has to respond. If the player talks out of character your NPC can react to that and by doing so, you can get the players to act it out.
The establishment is counting on people just like you who are pessimists that will never join fights for democracy and change.

Things aren't binary. He is probably not as progressive as Bernie but he is a heck of a lot better than all the other establishment Democrats.
Don't think that would be a constructive way of starting an conversation. Everyone already know what happened and we supporters can back him up for setting the proper goals like denying lobbyist money. I'm more worried about him getting cold feet on the ban of lobbyist money actually.\n\n**EDIT**: Nope. The way they put the question with "put it's thumb on the scale" is really a mild way of putting it. I agree that everyone, especially Keith, should have raised their hand.

I'd imagine that corruption works as it does in politics; *not* a business handing over a briefcase to a politician with the text printed "corruption" on it. We know that pharmaceutical corporations invite doctors to "meetings" which then affects the doctor's judgment when prescribing drugs. Like the telecom business has before infiltrated the FCC the pharmaceutical could very well ease on the regulations or decisions by the governmental organization that's responsible. These are not things going down in smoke filled rooms but in normal lobbying and too much contact with the industry that are under regulation.\n\nFor example; Tylenol contains a substance called Acetaminophen which is the number one cause of acute liver failure in America. The medical journal "The Lancet" published 1975 said that if it were discovered today, it wouldn't be freely available without prescription. Yet it took the FDA till 2009 to require them to even just put a warning label on it. It smells corruption or such gross negligence that the entire board should be fired.\n\nEDIT: It's not like these companies are some kind of saints: [Why Some Prescription Drugs Are More Dangerous than Illegal Drugs](http://www.trutv.com/shows/adam-ruins-everything/videos/why-some-prescription-drugs-are-more-dangerous-than-illegal-drugs.html)\n\nThere is reason for concern but, in my opinion, no reason for extreme pro or against stances.
Correction: [He failed to restore habeas corpus](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/181/restore-habeas-corpus-rights-for-enemy-combatants/).

Bernie performs better than Hillary when it comes to appealing to independents since he himself was/is an independent. Every one on one match-up poll I have ever seen, Bernie have won over every republican candidate while Hillary have been struggling to win over them and sometimes performed worse than republican candidates.\n\nSee this: [TYT: \nBernie Sanders Far More Electable In Head-To-Head Polls\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfFDc2Ute4Y)\n\nI we want the democratic party to win we need an electable candidate, yes.

> We all need to get our sling shot ability honed and send a huuge volley toward the Monster\n\nIndeed. Even tough voting is suppressed one can still affect the decisions that the politicians make. They'll continue do as their donors ask as long as nobody rises up and demands justice. As soon as people do, politicians gets scared of not getting re-elected. I participated in the [demonstrations against ACTA](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-16999497) in Europe and we actually stopped it. Same goes with the [demonstrations against SOPA and PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA) in the US.\n\nWe have the power and we must use it!\n\nEDIT: words
Didn't know about that payment. Where can I read about it? From what I have read, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have refused payment in exchange for their land. Anyway, if that is the case, that must be one of the worst rip-offs in history...\n\nIn any case, the government should try and set things right by at least not allow the pipeline to cross the water which belongs to the Army Corps of Engineers. 
Two things:\n\n1. We can't do anything corporations says. For example, the tax cuts and welfare Carrier gets now for not moving might be a substantial amount of money. It's gonna be interesting to take that sum and divide it by the amount of workers saved by the deal and then divide it by their mean annual income\n\n    That way we are gonna see how many years the workers would've survived if the government just gave the money to them directly instead of via Carrier.\n\n    Then compare the amount of years the government could've employed those workers to the amount of years they stay at Carrier until they decide they move to Mexico.\n\n2. There are some tools to make corporations stay in the US. One can [do like Bernie Sanders](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/-sanders-statement-on-carrier-and-outsourcing).
Judging by the confusion over the word "gratitude" completely out of context, this is the problem with 140 characters or less.
Some people says this is pointless by Obama to make this ruling since Trump will rip it to shreds and allow the pipeline once he is inaugurated but it's actually more clever than that. Trump now has to be the one to *overturn* the existing ruling which will create even more controversy since he has investments in these companies. So while this may not be the last thing we will hear about DAPL, Trump will get hurt as a president when he has to deal with it.

It's simple, religious people and for some reason especially in the US just think that it's foundational to their laws, how virtuous/ non-virtuous people act or just their plain existence. They can't process all this exists on a very thorough moral or ethical foundation WITHOUT any religion. And if that is true we must be able to derive a more reasonable foundation to existence WITHOUT religion or religious dogma, which assumes all knowledge in the universe with very little relative knowledge of the real world comparatively to today. It's like we don't want to admit we know so little and don't want to work together for the benefit of humanity instead of religion at times.
Years ago I contemplated Trump and really came to the conclusion Arnold would be more fit for President. Too bad people didn't fully consider trump while still voting for the man anyway!

I would bet there's a good chance close to majority of trump voters didn't even give a serious thought about major issues like campaign finance reform or even try to offer better solutions to help programs like medicare like allow them to directly negotiate with major drug companies for lower prescription drug prices or pressure the leading party to ensure programs like federal aid for senior drug prices won't be cut and many other Obamacare provisions will stay. Everyone's just ignorant and it's irresponsible to not think about the possibility of bringing nothing to the table on a major basic human right issue like Healthcare. Especially when people who voted for the president-elect might not pressure him to stand up to Congress and Senate if they look to misrepresent the majority of Americans. The guy is like fox news on Twitter, does everything except the real news and somehow that draws more attention then just doing their job. In a well represented democracy you should see the government make decisions time and time again in favor of majority of people, no one should have to worry or question that and politics can just be business as usual. Does that sound like the government you know? I don't think so and many people don't even feel enfranchised enough to come out to vote. This result is expected when at all levels we aren't doing enough. I think that is irresponsible

This man is easily going to go down as the best politician in history. From Burlington up to what he will be dealing with far into 2020 and beyond. It is truly remarkable to have representatives like this who's only distinguishing factors among their opponents at times is simply just having humility and empathy.
Sam expresses that the confidence rate of whatever we hold to be true now can only grow closer to a perfect truth value. Meaning in opposition to Peterson you should not to devalue or not call a truth what essentially is inching you closer along to linear path to a perfect truth value.

Also irresponsible to have elected officials and media run around like a chicken with their head cut off pandering to the stupid.

When my cousin was born I was in the delivery room in a corner watching a James Bond movie on my laptop. I had been at the hospital all morning just hanging out with my uncle waiting for the magic moment so I fired up a movie and stuck my headphones. Next thing you know I'm halfway through the movie and I look over and my uncles girlfriend is holding a baby that hadn't technically existed just a few minutes before. I was a little weirded out but I guess I wasn't in anyone's way.
Yeah really. I was in Chicago for a school trip and we hit Gino's for "the classic deep dish" or whatever the fuck it is. I tried to pick it up with my hands and eat it. The crust is not floppy, it is solid but brittle. While delicious, it snapped and dumped pizza directly into my lap.
I'm gonna need to be filled in.
I wouldn't say that it ruined my life or anything but it certainly isn't something that just goes away. I appreciate your concern though, sincerely.
Careful with that Axe, Eugene really works for me since my middle name is Eugene and I'm an axe murderer.
LSD or Bromo-Dragonfly! Awesome results with those and B-D does it without the trip.
I could be wrong but looks in the clips to me like he directly impacts the shield and the axe somehow ends up the valks neck.
This is how I feel too. I think running is cool there's teammates to revive or reinforcements coming or it has any strategic value at all really. Anyone who runs just to run when it's 4v1 and you're definitely going to die is just a fucking prick. I had to chase a Peacekeeper earlier for like 3 full minutes. I just wanna go to the next match. Accept your death dickhead, you're not going to win.
I was thinking him but give it to me straight...is he as useless as the sub says he is right now?
I tend to agree with you in some ways. I just think, like you mentioned, radicals are radical and politics are so tensioned these days that all things really need is a small spark. The assassination of Trump would be seen by many on the right as a direct attack and I wouldn't be surprised if some jackass went after someone like Bernie Sanders. He's essentially a messiah figure at this point to many progressives so that wouldn't end well. So on and so forth from there. There may not be a full blown civil war but all it takes is for an anti-republican protest to turn into a riot like they have and a few radical alt-righters to decide it's time to end it with force and bang boom, you've got a small scale civil war.
I know exactly what you mean. No problem, these things tend to be tough to talk about. I think what bothered me the most was washing away the last organic pieces of a human being left in the world. I felt like I was washing away some sort of memory of what was left of him. 
This is exactly what I was going to say. My uncle is a commercial truck driver and his truck will go no faster than 66 mph on a flat surface. 
I think the fact that the Demons Embrace can't kill him combined with the fact that if you have low health and he gets it, it automatically kills you is pretty stupid IMO. He doesn't look that great otherwise. People are just going to use a ton of cheese tactics to win with him I think.
I used to work at a car wash and the family of a kid who accidentally shot himself in the head with a large caliber pistol brought his car in to have the inside completely sanitized and cleaned. I've never seen so much blood in my life and I tried so hard to ignore what I knew were bits of skull rattling down the inside of the vacuum hose. I feel your pain.
I think you grossly misinterpret what Make America Great Again means. Part of it does have to do with curtailing issues of massive illegal immigration but that all rolls back into economics. Our country isn't doing so hot financially. Solving this issue has nothing to do with creating some sort of caste system that doesn't exist. If you read some of the other responses here you'll see exactly what the issues are and where they stem from. Rising costs of goods and services with the inability to simply make enough money to live comfortably. People like myself get tired of hearing how white privilege is ruining shit. My immediate family and I live hand to mouth like the majority of the country. We were promised change under Obama and didn't get it anything close to it. Broken promises from lifelong politicians are stale and old. Love him or hate him Trump came along with fire in his belly talking about how it was terrible how people were being treated by their leaders and he's right. Make America Great Again has to do with bringing America into an age where all American citizens have a fair shake and someone can make something of themselves. I know a guy with a Masters degree who bags groceries because he can't find decent work. \n\nI'm not going to argue whether he's going to do it or not because frankly I don't know. We're not very far into his presidency at this point and I'm not a gambling man. What I will say is making assumptions that all these people supported "keeping lower class citizens in their place" is ridiculous and gets us nowhere. I want America to be great and that means every American no matter who you are. Sure there are racist fuckwads but they represent a comparatively small portion of the population thankfully.\n\nMany people want just what MAGA says, for all of us Americans to be great.

My dad snuck up on me on purpose while I was balls deep in my girlfriend at 17 losing my virginity (we were both fully clothed with just enough moved away to make penetration work) to throw money at me and tell me to go pick up a pizza for dinner. He thought it was hilarious, I did not. Earlier in the night he sent me grandma down to the basement to say hi to me for a laugh too. The gross part is I had just been having my very first taste of eating a girl out and my grandma would **NOT** leave me the hell alone until she "got a smooch from her pumpkin". I still shudder thinking about it.

No there isn't a match up issue. The other guy is right, it's a skill issue. It's not a slam on you, you just have to get better and create better strategies against those players. Assassins are definitely beatable by heavy characters you just have to utilize the right tools.
I'll jump in and say that I agree with you here but you better believe that had Bernie made it to the big show from the primaries, he wouldn't have walked away squeaky clean. They never ever ever do. Mitt Romney is a damned Mormon and a hell of a likable guy but they flung so much shit at him he looked like swamp thing. Everyone has skeletons and you and I both know that when it comes to politics, those skeletons get drug out and hung for everyone to examine scientifically like one of the stereotypical ones you see in movies in high school biology labs. Whatever the Republicans do have on Bernie, they just haven't released it because there's a very good chance they'll need it in the future. In politics, the weapons never have empty chambers.
I agree with you here actually. I'm just saying in this specific situation, I would make it known to whoever is in the bear I have a weapon and they should come out nice and easy. I don't carry my gun everywhere to use as intimidation or negotiation but if I think someone is in my house, I certainly would have no qualms about getting my gun out without pointing or shooting unless I absolutely have to.
And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad\nThe dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\nI find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take\nWhen people run in circles it's a very very\nmad world mad world
They're supposed to be glass cannons. They deal massive damage because of how quick they die. As Orochi if I'm against say, Raider, I can only take like 4 hits before I'm dead.
My family has been sick consistently on my dad's side so he's been buying so much Sudafed to keep everyone on their feet lately he's gotten turned away. Now we wait for the cops and hilarity ensues.

In PA this is a meme that's how bad it is. The roads are ranked as some of the worst. We have a major highway in central PA, 81, and it's constantly being worked on. They start at one end and work their way down and as soon as they get done, it took them so long they have to start at the beginning again. I'm not even kidding.
As a yank I had no idea who Jimmy Saville was until recently because of the pedophile thing. There's a huge amount of evidence of an organized high end child sex ring in the UK. It's nuts.
Shit I live in PA and the first thing I would've done is grab my gun too. If you shoot before you make it known you have a gun, especially since chances are a home invader wouldn't mess with you like that, you're an idiot.
Under extreme duress for whatever reason was my thought.
This I would agree with and I do believe that something is up here but I'm not 100% convinced he's dead.
I can appreciate the unique idea for the game. I think if I would make any change here it would be putting the stance buttons directly next to the attack buttons. So essentially, thumb on the stance buttons, fingers on the attacks.
He's not high level, he's just super spastic in his movements. He's got feints down but otherwise he just switches stances and shoves a lot. A fast character like Orochi or Peacekeeper who utilized dodge well would spank him.
**YEEEEE DOGGEH LOOK AT THE DAM**
That didn't work so great for the ChiComs dude. You can't really tell people how many kids they can or can't have.
That's kinda my point though. I'm not gonna bother to stay in close when my only option is something other hero's can do better and easier. I think the ability to deflect is what opens assassin characters up and I'd like to see it utilized better.
Wait so it doesn't kill? That's cheese AF. How is it fair that you could take someone at full health and just spam that until it lands and kills them in 1 hit? This guy seems pretty OP.
It's like I'm watching Smokey and the Bandit all over again 
How in the hell do you have that kind of time? Sheesh.
Well the original firm during the first lottery where the Knicks were picked and subsequently got Ewing, Ernst and Whinney (now Ernst and Young), also did the accounting for Gulf and West. Gulf and West owned Madison Square Garden, the home of the Knicks. There's an interesting incestuous sort of relationship there where G&W could easily have threatened to drop E&W as their accountants if they didn't guarantee the Knicks got Ewing.

Head of Breitbart.com which is the internet hub for a large amount of farther right news. I'll let you look it up and draw your own conclusions.
That's very true. You can also dodge twice or even three times to move away and start the combo with a storm rush. Depends on the level of player you're playing against. I had a lot of success playing very aggressively, barely using blocking or parries at all against all level of players. I actually also noticed against high level players even if you get the deflect, while follow up attacks are unblockable, it allows enough time for someone with quick reflexes to hit you with a quick light attack and cancel the attack. So even deflects can sometimes be ineffective.
You're a horrible excuse for a human being. I in no way liked Obama. I thought he was spineless and that a lot of his and his admins policies led to American deaths yet I never once wished for him to be killed and struck down those who thought he should, people like you. You should be absolutely ashamed but I know you won't be because you think your "righteous anger" gives you the moral high ground. I'm disgusted that I have to share the same planet with you.
~~Additionally, the rifle they recovered from the Texas Schoolbook Depository was an Italian Carcano rifle. These rifles are notorious for being unreliable and horribly inaccurate. Not only was Oswald not known to have the know how to hit a small moving head, he was using one of the worst possible rifles to do so.~~\n\nEdit: This is what I had read prior and apparently it's a huge misconception. The 6.5 Italian Carcano can be incredibly accurate in the **proper** hands. Others have said it was the **specific** rifle Oswald had, as it was a mail order piece of junk.
I think it's fine the way it is because you have to be wary of it. I think it's supposed to be quick because you have to consider it when lining up to square off with your opponent. If I back someone up as Orochi and dodge and disengage I have to be aware of the fact that they could make a break for their downed partner. Think of it as a strategic game mechanic rather than a pain in the ass. 
They toss one envelope rather hard at the side of the bowl but it seems to keep its shape pretty well if you look hard enough. Even so, some of the other envelopes had slight imperfections such as slightly bent corners too. I think it was fixed, but I don't think that's what did it.
I really do think people are picking Orochi at this point simply because they think he's cool. I picked Orochi because I watched Oroboro play as him and thought his moveset looked cool and proceeded to fall in love. As the game progresses many of those people will likely realize he isn't for them and move to other classes. As far as I go as soon as I get max gear for Orochi I'm gonna start on a different hero. It'll balance out eventually.
I totally agree with what I read in the linked post above. If Julian used that as his sole defining proof of life then an imposter would simply need to get a hold of that key somehow and voila, they're now effectively Assange.
Uconn pupperino is vvv gud diddler!
If it makes you feel any better I've accidentally blurted out babe when talking to randoms because I say babe so often talking to my girlfriend. I even once told my mechanic I loved him when I went to hang up because I had just been on the phone with my mom. Sometimes people speak without thinking so maybe he wasn't creepy, just wasn't thinking.
I'm really curious to hear the intricacies of this one.
Sounds like something my girlfriend would do...God I love that girl. Happy Valentines babe!
You're expecting high level stuff out of people that probably haven't played enough to get there. I use deflects and guard breaks and get offensive as much as I can. The issue though is that Orochi is so squishy that if I screw the tight as hell timings up for an assassin I end up getting punished and dying. Dodging is a necessary and huge part of playing an assassin. They're quicker on their feet for a reason, they're not meant to stand and fight. I agree that straight running away is annoying but you can't ask an Orochi to stand and trade like a Warden. Back Orochi into a corner with a good guard break and watch how fast he gets wrecked, good parry and block reflexes or not.
>The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election.\nThe officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation.\n\n\nThis part seems pretty important,  why is everyone ignoring it? I'm honestly asking. The rest of the article is rehashing most of what's already supposedly known. I'm just not sure why everyone is freaking out.
I mean to be fair the guy looks hopelessly bored like 90% of the time. His face never leaves that dead, uncaring look even when he's walking past decked out soldiers in his huge fucking house.

I think assuming that a "lot" of people see it as a dick move is incorrect. I see here that the opinion that 2v2 is meant as a team game mode is much more prevalent. If you win, go help your teammate. The advantage you get is hard fought so you mine as well use it. I played a few brawls earlier and even when I teamed up on somebody they still sent the "Good Fight!" at the end of the round and I did too when I got teamed up on. More than anything you should just accept I think or else you're going to end up frustrated when it doesn't happen the way you want.

I 100% believe the NFL is rigged somehow. The ratings for football are consistently dropping and lately it seems that more and more games are coming down to the wire, requiring last minute touchdowns or field goals to win. If anything I think it makes sense because the longer you stay tuned in, the more ads they can run by your face since on average there's only 11 minutes of actual football you see on TV anyway. 
Regrouping or running for a strategic reason like reviving a teammate is cool. Don't run from a 4 or 3v1 though. That's just a dick move. You're going to die in that situation. Accept it and let everyone move on.
Any vape or hobby shop should sell small plastic containers with individual battery compartments. At the very least I put my batteries in their own sandwich baggies to prevent this.
Is that a GT or are you insulting me? Haha 
The positive thing with Orochi for me is that even if I missed a deflect it was usually because I was over cautious and early. Their attack would usually just whiff and I'd guard break, top stance light attack, storm rush, heavy attack. After that he's left wondering where his heads gone to. Love Orochi.

As a guy who played as an assassin (Orochi), my biggest issue were guys who knew how to ward off attacks. If you can block the rapid fire attacks and run me out of stamina, it only takes a few attacks to down me. Idk who you main but if it's a heavier guy, adopting an efficient rushdown strategy yourself is scary too. 
Let me ask you something that I wouldn't dare ask the dedicated subreddit: Why are people so obsessed with that show? Why is it so great? I slogged through a few episodes but I just don't see the pull. I love Adventure Time and Regular Show as far as modern cartoons but the allure of this one evades me.
I don't know what you consider the political left rising but there were mass protests that included rioting and property damage in some areas. That pissed off a lot of people who saw it as little kids throwing temper tantrums. I'm not commenting on the morality of either thing but what I am saying is that if someone were to assassinate Trump, I guarantee you someone on the radical right would retaliate. There would be escalation to some degree I think.
Well now I'm seeing that they're putting it back to how it was in the beta, which I'm pretty happy about. As an Orochi I usually harass from distance so the absolute bane of my existence is someone who guard breaks a lot and I need to be able to stop that.
Maybe I'm totally off but I just feel like someone with a controller would have a better chance of winning because of ease of button press combinations.
Everything you've said comes down to two words: New engine.

As an Orochi main the one thing I'll say is that all you really have to do is back me into a corner and it's all over. Without room to maneuver it pretty much negates all of that quickness.

 Playing a game with a little kid is hard. When my daughter was 4 I made up a game called "**Odysseus and the Cyclops**".\n\n You'll need a ball and some objects to represent sheep. We used pine cones.\n\n The kid (or kids) is Odysseus. The adult is the cyclops. Scatter the sheep around an area of your choosing (we played on a tennis court) to create a flock. The kid(s) start in the middle of the flock. The cyclops stands some distance away (adjust according to taste and how much you want the kid(s) to win) with the ball (boulder). At "go" the kid(s) gather the sheep as fast as they can. The cyclops now attempts to "crush" the kid(s) by throwing the ball (boulder) at them. The cyclops **must play the game with one eye closed**. The cyclops must also retrieve the boulder after throwing and return to their general area (lair).\n\n Our games were made more fun by our dogs running around after the boulder and contributing to the chaos.\n

 I use Photoshop, but you should be able to replicate this process in GIMP.\n\n 1 - Make a document sized to what you need. Make it evenly divisible in cm or inches. \n\n 2 - Make a generic space of your score track on a different layer or document. Make it 1 inch or 2 cm or whatever you need, but make it so that you can set the grid size so that the space is 1 unit of the grid. **DO NOT** add a number to this space.\n\n 3 - Set the grid to match the space. Turn on snapping.\n\n 4 - Select the space and copy it or make it a brush or whatever GIMP does so you can paste or stamp the space.\n\n 5 - Put that space where you need the track.\n\n 6 - After you've placed the spaces, create a new layer and name that layer "Track Numbers". Add the numbers to the track in this layer.\n\n 7 - Wonder where three hours went to.\n\n  Hope that was clear. Here are some samples of using that basic technique: [Quick & Dirty graphic design](http://imgur.com/a/M4mJi). \n\n All that said, if you're prototyping the board you made in Excel would work just fine provided it's large enough to play on.

 Your whole first paragraph... no. First, you use "typically" as a qualifier. Prove it. There are a set of *typical* values? If you're talking about anything other than self-preservation and self-enrichment, then I don't believe you. And as for "all men are created equal"... I think I covered that, but again, I think equality should encompass woman as well as men.\n\n 
But that is EXACTLY how it works. A craven, rich, hard right wing dictatorship does not give money to a major American political figure to promote health and political uplift for the poor. They give money to major American political figures because they expect a profit. And I'm not talking about Muhammad. 
 No, I understand your point. My point about what you said is that you are projecting a commonality without any evidence. You can say "if you ask..." (or some variation thereof), but if you haven't done that, then you can't claim that their values are "freedom, justice, equality". \n\n I fully agree with you that people many people maintain double standards when it comes to whom their declared (declared, not necessarily practiced) values should apply.
When all you have is a hammer (legislation) everything looks like you can control human behavior and impose your will by writing laws on paper. 
No I haven't. I can see how that would mitigate *some* of the randomness, but luck is not my biggest complaint with the game.  The theme is fantastic. Unfortunately the mechanisms used in the game do not integrate well with the theme . In other words, I find the game play largely detached from the theme. I'm on my phone so I can't go into too much detail, but while you are supposedly kick starting an entire planetary ecology (basically from scratch), there is very little interaction between the various systems other than simple dependency checks.  A combination of worker placement and engine building would better match the theme.  Subtract the theme from the game and you are left with a not terribly interesting deck builder with scoring tiles.

For example, in Pandemic, everyone can treat disease (remove cubes). The Medic is more efficient at treating disease. A rule breaking role is the Quarantine Expert. That role prevents disease cubes from being placed in their location. \n\n So make the game "generically" playable (fun) and then concern yourself with the special abilities.

 Hey /u/BlairWaldorfHeadband, I'm rational enough not to downvote people because I don't like the answer to the question I asked them. \n\n Now, did you vote for Clinton because of all the candidates you felt she was best qualified and wanted to see her as the president or did you vote for Clinton because you wanted Trump to lose?\n\n If you voted for Clinton because you wanted Trump to lose, I would argue that you threw your vote away. \n\nEdit: a word
Brütal Legend. It's a video game.\n\n In any case, I wouldn't worry about whether or not something has been done before. Can you do it better? \n\n If being the first was what mattered, E.E. Doc Smith would be insanely popular and no one would have ever heard of George Lucas.\n\n
There is a paper claiming real time capture, but these images are from 2014.
For a working example of a game with a lot of dice rolling that is way more skill than luck try Stone Age. 
 Brexit does not fix that. I never claimed it does. Do not assume that because I pose a question that I must be of the polar opposite opinion. \n\n Brexit is a big "Fuck You" to the powers that be. People without prospects... sometimes that's all they can do.

To be frank, that doesn't sound very interesting. In fact, it sounds a bit boring.\n\n Risk is a game of little strategy and lots of dice rolling. As an activity, some people find dice rolling fun, but there are plenty of games that provide that opportunity. For example, Risk.\n\n You make no mention of *how* the game is cooperative. So there's nothing really to comment on about that. \n\n Random enemies. Sure, in cooperatives the players are playing against a bot, but in good cooperatives the bots are designed to provide a challenge to *how* the players are playing the game (and typically bots are also the game clock). A random bot doesn't sound fun, it sounds tedious. \n\n That said, there is no reason that a game as you describe couldn't be designed to be fun. The kick is that it would need to be designed. So maybe if you actually design something you can make a fun game. Your description is too high altitude to generate a valid criticism.\n\n \n\n
I was hoping FO4 would have two.  \n\nI wanted Providence to be in the game. Imagine if the central conflict was a war between the Institute and their army of synths and a Lovecraft mythos fuelled feral ghoul invasion from the south.  \n\nThat would have been fun. 
 Funny you should write this /u/BlairWaldorfHeadband as earlier today you commented to me that;\n\n>I voted for Clinton because I wanted her to be president. I was going to vote for her no matter who the Republican candidate was.\n\nPerm: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5un458/donald_trump_overturns_law_preventing_companies/ddx5k45/\n\n So as I mentioned to you previously, it really doesn't matter how much research you did. \n\n Despite people voting for Stein because they wanted Stein to be president, you want to blame them for **your** candidate not winning. That is **LITERALLY** the equivalent of blaming Trump voters because they didn't vote for **your** candidate. You are whining because people disagree with you. Grow up and if you want to "be on the right side of history" make sure that any party you support nominates a person that people want to vote for. And stop blaming people for who the vote for. That kind of attitude is one of the reasons that people didn't vote for Clinton. Stop trying to invalidate other people's opinions, no matter how much you disagree with them. \n\n\n

Still looking for that gig of Dogmeat falling off of Trinity Tower when attempting to enter the outside elevator that was leaked a day or three before release.  That was funny as hell 
 Why are people downvoting this? If a "value" (i.e. - an *opinion*) was somehow bound into our psychological make-up simple by virtue of being born in a specific country, those **opinions** wouldn't require "defending", they would simply exist. What /u/ApollosCrow is actually saying is that the opinions of a few rich white guys from over two hundred years ago are not only *more* important than your own opinion, but that you should expend your time and effort to defend those opinions. \n\n So... Fuck that. You may share those opinions. I may share those opinions. That's not the point. Expecting someone else to not only share your opinions, but to act as a guardian of those opinions is a memetic disease. \n\n BTW: I do **not** share their opinions. For example, I don't think that only white males who own property should be allowed to vote.\n\n Where are your values now?
People in general are like this. They assume a moral cause and effect. 
 Actually, the burden of proof is on you. I did not make a claim (read what I wrote), so there is nothing to prove. You made a claim that is not backed up by anything other than (I assume - I could be wrong) your own desire for your fellow citizens to share a trait that you have or believe yourself to have. \n\n I believe quite firmly that the *idea of those values* exist. As the writer Alan Moore put it, "The only place that gods in-arguably exist is in the minds of men." I never said I do not think that people *don't* believe they practice their values. The point I have been making is that assuming that a group of people share the same values simply because they share a legal tie (citizenship) to a piece of land (the USA) is ridiculous. Does a crack addict in Baltimore share the same values as Donald Trump? How much do your values overlap with those two? How do you know?
 Since your game is described as taking place long enough after the war that no one alive remembers what the world was like before, "Aftermath" may not be the best title. Aftermath implies something happening relatively soon after a series of events. Maybe call it something like "Ruinworld"?

Yes, I'm telling you to grow up because accusing people of being wrong when they have expressed their opinion (which is what voting is) will achieve nothing but make you look like you are a self-centered. Know-it-all asshole. Clinton is a shitty person and an awful candidate. You can scream at people all you want, but at the end of the day she lost to a pussy grabbing, orange flavored idiot because people hate her. You want things to be different?  So do those people that voted for Trump. You want things to be better? Support a party that nominate someone people will want to vote for. 
Shitpost.

This game is pretty bad, even at $40. Im not happy about it, since I own it. Unfortunately.\n\n
So you agree then? Thats awesome.
You should of filed a police report, tho I assume you didn't, maybe you did? Even of they do nothing, at least its on record.
He's said it before. About Bush.

Im already 275$ into this. Shame they were mostly concerned about making money instead of a good game, which would of ultimately made them more money than any telethon or blood selling.

Not really.
Wouldnt it be easier to not wipe away any glue and just scrape it off after its dry?
Its a little disconcerting that almost every forum that this game has for discussion, is moderated. Official ones and Non official. It would seem that Portalarium reach is a long one.
Not very, at-least not on steam. http://steamcharts.com/app/326160\nNow one could say 'not everyone is using steam'. Sure thats a valid point/concern.\nThat being the case, they should release the numbers of people not using steam.\n
The more a game forces me to do something, the less I want to do it.\nYou force me to keep playing, to keep my skill up, I'm not going to play. Give me goals, not punishments. When everything is a grind, whats the point. I have real life for grinding.

I had replied stating that the supporters typically insult the person making a respectful claim. But if it doesn't agree w/ the narrative, it will be supporters who start insulting. This was proven, and the thread locked as is the norm. Censorship is the norm. They claim they want constructive criticism, whenever its given, posts deleted or threads locked. Its disturbing.

Even when i do comment in their forums I will always keep it civil, i refuse to cross the line of name calling, or making fun of people. TO me that's not an argument. However the supporters in the forum seem to have no problem calling people names. And they are rarely banned or removed because of it. I mostly feel badly because I could have spent my money on something more constructive than this game.

Sure, thats fair but there is no mention in this article of prostitution by minors in this particular 200 person bust. They say they've dealt with it in the past, but no mention of it this time.

By the same police, who we know are liars and who plant drugs. https://www.google.com/amp/ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/canadian-jeremy-eaton-sentenced-to-life-in-jail-in-philippines-for-selling-ecstasy/amp?client=safari
One thing I don't understand: How do they have your CC info and can't you just deny the charges? If they are fraudulent companies, won't banks etc have a record of that?
This is very much an American film. It's produced by Legendary!!

The whole movie of "Interstellar"
Ok, Gramma
Wow, this trip sounds absolutely incredible and life-changing. The pictures are amazing so thank you so much for sharing them, it really inspires my imagination. Question; I read about the sticker-boys shakedown attempt, what instances were you forced to pay bribes? Was it scary? Were people armed?
The sad thing is, it's become apparent that politicians and other right-wing pundits and social figures don't need to hide their white-nationalist ties anymore, and can in fact embrace them and still do great politically. I think we're gonna start seeing more and more of this over the next few years. At this point, Ann Coulter can probably come out and say "The white race is the master race and I hate blacks and mexicans" and she would be totally fine at her job and politically or whatever. The right isn't bowing to the pressure from the left anymore to maintain some sort of decency in their speech, connections and ties.

People in this thread seem to be talking about this movie like it's a Chinese movie. It's American through and through though
Everybody on this thread is telling you don't do it, that it is a scam but you keep arguing with them. Why? You wanna do it and risk losing your money and no one is gonna change your mind, it seems. If transactions on the internet seem like they might be seedy, they almost always are. 
This seems very difficult and annoying, sorry you have to go through this. If it's any consolation, people who make Aliah also have to go through a rigorous examination of their Judaism. And I knew several people who immigrated from France, the US, Russia, etc who were denied because their "proof" wasn't good enough and it was heartbreaking for them. 
That was a cool and fun video. I agree that a talented editor can really add a whole lot to the work, but so much of what they add is often invisible, unfortunately, meaning it's hard for the viewer to decipher whether any given edit was the director's choice or the editor's choice. For instance, in this video there were indeed some great edits. Although it seemed to me that a whole lot of what was shown was the director's choice, scripted and decided in pre-production. I'm a professional director and I've certainly had editors completely elevate videos or save them from sucking (on ones I've done that weren't as good). That said, when hiring editors, it's so much more difficult to tell if they are talented by their reels. I often hire crew and For DP's, production designers, and wardrobe people it's really easy to tell with one glance at their website or reel how talented or untalented they are. A movie or video can be god-awful, but you can easily tell if the sets are cool and the color schemes etc. Can't say the same about the editing. Conversely, a film or video or whatever can be really cool but you can't really tell if it was the editor's doing or what.
Yup, unless OP has been in the same class for a decade

I wish i was into sports more. I love talking shit as a joke but durn, social media has gotten seriously rabid this last year or two, just like people trying to ruin others peoples' lives because they believe different things.

I was about to reply to your first comment and ask if you've heard of the Shack Shakers, then saw this one. I think blood on the bluegrass invented that genre. I think JD used to call it "southern gothic" like the literature movement. I was so into them for a while, have you ever seem them live?
There's one called "Flashbacks of a Fool" with Daniel Craig... The imdb synopsis is : "A fading Hollywood star looks back on his youth as he returns to his small town home for his best friend's funeral"... This one really got me, hit me somewhere deep inside. Also it has an amazing glamrock soundtrack (Roxy Music, Bowie, etc)
There is a certain mindset that wants to blame the US and Brittain for any and all problems or atrocities in the world. Like there's no way that sweet and lovely foreign peoples could possibly be shitty. The CIA/MI6 conspiracy guy seems to be of that camp.

I guess the big question is how do they already have your credit card info? 
I think it's better that French and Brittish men can piss in the streets of Paris and Lindon than the situation in New York. In NYC there are pretty much no public bathrooms anywhere and this creates real problems when you have to piss (which is pretty much everybody in the world). People still do piss in the streets, but I wish we didnt have to hide it so much. It makes it pretty difficult and annoying, I wish we wouldn't be so ashamed of a common bodily function that everyone does, and just let that stream rip at will.
It's an American film funded by American dollars. Why does everyone in this thread think it's a Chinese film?
I absolutely loved that film. The way I interpereted it is that the filmmaker created a world in which the religious beliefs of the characters were also a reality. It was sort of a trip into the mind of the zealots who lived in the era and region. It made their religious delusions a reality and I thought that was really cool. 
Just curious, why are you searching for such an item?

Yeah but a great editor is so incredibly valuable. They can turn a complete piece of garbage into something that is great and fun if the director is willing to take a chance with them. Ive had that happen with me before. That kind of talent is very rare though, but so valuable. Also a great editor can elevate something that is good into something that is great, I've had that happen too
Agreed, but there are also large violent crime and murder rates tied to the narcotic trade... But if police bust some people buying and selling consumer amounts of weed and coke, should the police and papers say "police arrest 200 in violent crime and murder ring". Regardless of your stance on drugs and prostitution, both of these instances are lying, they are propoganda because they think those words will spark more outrage amongst the citizenry

I was at this weird punk/anarchist commune farm thing for a new years eve party once. It was pretty wild, it was at this mansion in the middle of nowhere. There was nudity here and there, costumes, drugs, and random debauchery. My lady friend and i were outside most of the evening at the bonfire, and at about 4am we went inside to find a place to lay our sleeping bag and go to sleep. We went upstairs looking for a room, opened a door and there were like 15 lesbians in there having a big makeout orgy with the lights on. I wanted to see but One or two of them immediately got super pissed and told us to GTFO and close the door. We did. We started to walk into another bigger room, a huge-ass room where the party was still going on. There was loud electronic music and like neon blue lights in there. We wandered for a minute then i noticed to my left this naked guy laying on a lazyboy, sucking two dudes' dicks. Just as i noticed this and was confused, a third dude walked up and started fucking him in the ass. I started looking around and realized there was gay sex going on everywhere i looked. We went back downstairs and went to sleep on the kitchen floor. Fun party.

Is nonsense propoganda. Its implying that the major corporations Comcast and AT&T are people and have feelings
I wonder if this is somehow a move to start pushing youtube red
There are a whole lot of cultural influences on attractiveness. Body type in men is a very minor part of that. Attractiveness of men here in the western world largely stems from cultural background, personality, style, intelligence, language, humor, education, charisma, social standing, socio-economic status etc etc. If body type were even close to the main source of attractiveness, you would see women of all backgrounds flocking to gardeners and dudes who just got out of prison and the rather than to Danny DeVito and Seth Rogan types (I worked with Seth Rogan's wife, btw, she's amazing). That said, this article really offers no research or statistics... Just some half-assed 2nd Life computer renderings.

This is the 2nd article I've seen that uses "human trafficking" in the headline but the body of the article is mainly about arresting people who are soliciting regular ole prostitution. The article says that the taskforce deals with human trafficking or has dealt with in the past but doesnt mention any incidents in this bust. Is "human trafficking" the new term to make people morally support their anti-prostitution cause?
Pendulums freak me the fuck out. Well, gravity in general does. Often when I'm reminded of gravity as a concept, I get some bad anxiety, I start thinking the world is going to explode or crash into the sun or both

> There is no "Fake President." There is, "Shit, I should have voted..."\n\nI do agree that he was voted in, and even the polls this week show 45% approval.\n\nHowever he might still be unfit. As he is seemingly in breach with the constitution, and has close ties to Russia, and Russian interference in the election. Trump might have the voters on his side, but the opposition seems to have the Law on theirs. (And science, common sense, majority of the population, the Pope, Merkel, Hollande and other foreign allies) 
As I said, there are refugees that are smart and have educations, but we must acknowledge that the countries people are fleeing from today, are not in the top of academia. \n\nThe Germans however were just that. They literally had the best people for some reason. Many left early, and some after the war. They even managed to send rockets into space. Both the Russian and the American space programs in the following years were really just continuations of the German space programs. \n\nThe moon landings were designed by a former major in the SS. Not by Americans, but by Nazi Germans. \n\nThe situation we have today is not the same, some refugees might be educated, but they are most certainly not pioneers in their fields and literally the worlds best engineers. \n\nI am not saying we should not invite them in, I am simply saying that it will not lead to the same advancements as the Germans did.
Moral of the story is that the Americans are not old enough to have their own self governing.

Yeah, but this is selective. Take curling. On the Norwegian team there are engineers, managers, business owners and event managers. Its not like you have to be in peek physical conditions to play curling. They got silver in Vancouver, gold back in Salt Lake City. \n\nBartosz Piasecki is a math teacher from Norway, ranked at 47th place in the world, he took Silver in Fencing in London.\n\nOlav V, former King of Norway, was a competing Olympian, and has Gold from the Olympics in Amsterdam in sailing.\n\nHis son, King Harald V, who is the current king, has competed in the Olympics three times. He never made it to any medals, but did win the world championship in 87, also sailing. \n\nThese are some people I just happen to know of who don't have the sport as their main day to day routine. You don't have to train all the time, you simply have to be the best.\n\nOf course in big sports, there is money. Since there is money, people can be paid to work 24/7 with that sport, to become the best. But in smaller sports, its not like that. "Random" people show up and happen to be the best.\n\nThere probably are a lot of top rated chess players who do something else for work. When gaming is recognized as a sport in the west, we will see a lot of people show up, who just happen to be better, but they will probably quickly get bought. 
You gonna set the same standards to tennis? Volley ball? Golf? They seem to be at some shady shit too, just not religious.

But if we take "Cover more of the world", sure English covers North America, Europe, some of Africa, India and Australia. But French and Spanish also does this. It is really India that makes the difference here. Spanish can be spoken almost anywhere in South America, and in Spain.\n\nIf we are going to use "Land area", Russian is able to compete for high ranks without counting other countries. Even the Scandinavian countries control areas large enough to compete here, because they speak the same language. \n\nThere simply are more people that speak mandarin. If you, as an alien, took some random guy from a random place on earth, he probably doesn't speak English nor Mandarin, but out of the two, there are greater odds of him speaking Mandarin.

To be fair, for any state to say it is leaving the union, is a declaration of war. 
I pre-ordered that on the spot. They changed it and then scrapped it iirc, never got my money back. only dev ill pre-order from again is CD project Red.
It's not that hard of a shot, it's clutch as fuck, but it's not a hard shot. It's crosshair-placement, a counter-strafe and well timed.
I'm pretty sure the current astralis asked the finns if it was okay. not sure about 1.6 danish astralis. I could only find frag movies and stuff of the finnish clan.
they still have to vote for it. Even though theres a majority of republicans does not mean that they will all vote for the same thing
Extremely Palpatine
if Optic wins this, NiP vs. C9 where the loser is out could happen...
Yeah, I can control the first 7 bullets pretty well, which is all I need for a kill or 2. I really hope the person in the vid lagged hard.
need tarik and mixwell to start hitting as well
winning important rounds and clutches is okay. Immortals are wooing after losing 4 people against an eco...
nip magic generally came from misplays though. thats how nip won those magical rounds. in combination with nip players being gods of course.
yeah, she seemed really calm and rehearsed and prepared, but she felt like she was just there for me. she definitely won the debate. Trump started having troubles when she ignored everything and stuck to her script.
He won the election though? popular vote doesnt really matter so why should we care about it? Also considering so many americans didnt even vote... I'm not a fan of Trump, but maybe people need to realize that he's not as stupid as they make him out to be. He would have lost to almost any other candidate, but his campaign obviously worked, or he wouldnt have won. thats all im saying.
Are you talking about Fribergs shot? His teammate saw him and called it out, wasnt luck.
I feel like Clinton didnt do any "debating" though. She just stated her tightly rehearesed policies again and again, if I wanted that information I could've just gone to her website. But she made Trump desperate by just ignoring him so idk.
>we didn't end up with North vs OpTic...\n\nwe as in viewers. would suck to eliminate optic or north instead of HR or f3.
hillary has been a lawyer and then politician for all her life, Trump is known for reality TV and outlandish comments. Which showed here.  I'm not even american though, but I think it's interesting and frightening that these two are the presidental candidates.
believe it or not, not every person is a childish crybaby who has to ruin the enjoyment for others when things arent going their way.

Norwegian government introduced a law that prohibited smoking in public places. Not a smoker myself, so I'm not sure how the limitations are. but I think all smoking in public places is illegal and all public places/bars/pubs need a designated smoke area if they want to allow smoking. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. As a non-smoker I love it though, You almost have to go out of your way to be a passive smoker.
think a scottish word or sentence and try speaking it.
You always want to be sidestrafing(with A and D) when you expect someone to be there, never A+W etc. when going into an area you know enemies are likely to be, try to position yourself so you can just sidestrafe the angle instead of running into it with W+A/D. Makes it a lot easier to counter-strafe and hit your target. Also the further away you are from the corner as you peek, the faster you will see around, so when peeking an angle always get as far back as you can.\n\nGeneral tips for solo cs: Always try to set yourself up as good as possible when a gunfight is on the way. Which means: don't be out in the open with no way to retreat, don't all in a fight by just crouchspraying instantly(especially if you can just sidestrafe back into cover). Pre-aim an angle you expect an enemy to be before strafepeeking it with A/D as I said before. Always keep crosshair where enemies may be so you wont have to flick. Don't take unneccessary 1v1 battles if you can get a 2v1 instead or if you have a man advantage. 
I understand both swedish and danish really easily. Unless it's a really tough dialect.
It's a competetive game, same as Basketball, football and chess etc. I agree it's not a sport however. And why does it even have to be a "sport" to be legit? Chess isnt a sport, but we still recognize the insane amount of hours the best players spend training and practicing. Same way with Competetive gaming imo. \n\nI don't want CSGO to end up in a League like Basketball etc. The great thing about CSGO are all the tournaments all around the world, with different teams and skill levels all the time. Really hope it stays semi-niche like this.
nip magic man
Don't even live in the US. I just dont see a reason to take an insult like that more seriously than any other

I know how it works, just havent adjusted to the new spray after an update a while back.

cause thats how the electorial college works. trump has won Wyoming with 0%
As a IGL you have to constantly think about what strats you are about to run vs. what the enemies are running. Teammates will give you info on whats happening on the map and you have to make decisions on what to do/not to do. Therefore IGLs shouldnt be going for the massive plays unless forced to. Let someone whose sole role is to shoot people in the head do that. Its better you have some clutch players later on in the round than an IGL that should maybe already be thinking about economy/next-round. \n\nthat said however. Ct-Side is not as strat heavy. IGL generally calls when to buy etc. Aggro pushes here and there, whole team should communicate on rotates. normally people play in pairs on site, so they will communicate with eachother. I also doubt OpTic has a lot of advanced strats with the new roster(they may be using stans strats, but just telling hiko what to do) \n\nGenerally IGLs who also frag well will call really simple explosive strats where they just call fast and can then focus on shooting heads. Like Stewie(imo barely an IGL), NiKo on mouz earlier in the year. Then you have IGLs like Fallen who has a great system set up with his players, everyone almost always knows what to do unless he calls something else. So he is a great fragger and a great IGL based on the system he has managed to set up.\n\ngot a lot longer than you wanted, probably. sorry :D
I disagree on snax, i feel he has impact almost every round in a game, and often steps up in important ones. Cold hasnt been all that great recently imo, end of 2016 to now I think he's barely been SK's best player. Dev1ce is easily the best player on Astralis(except finals in Atlanta) \n\nAnd that is why I don't think cold is the best player, I feel like all the players will rotate when it comes to form. But atm Cold has not been playing well enough to earn the best player in the world title.
if optic wins vs. astralis they can get mouz, HR, f3 or liquid. if they lose they can get same. getting the best 2 teams early makes it so optic should really only have weaker teams left.
Mange gode ideer her, kan se for meg at de er i bruk allerede. kanskje til og med flere av dem samtidig. blir enda verre når han skal forsvare tittelen i Russland. Ser for meg sabotering da.\n\nEr ikke så mye som skal til for å avbalansere motstanderen; alle mulighetene hvis man kontrollerer mat, bolig osv. De har sikkert allerede regnet ut hvilken diett og temperatur som har mest effekt på hjernen.\n\nEr ikke tvil om at de kommer til å sette inn alt dette i spill i andre sporter hvis det funker her. Se opp for Russerne de neste ti åra!

dennis, gtr, flusha, olof and f0rest
nothing? from what i've seen Trump just wants to reduce illegal immigrants.
put both of them in jail in my opinion :D
SC:BW :D
reaction time doesnt matter unless you're playing at the very top. Crosshair-placement, aim practice, dont move while shooting, help teammates, learn spray control(at least 10 bullets). Should get you out of silver easily. DMG probs depending on aim/gamesense/movement.
Masterchef Australia is the only competition show worth watching
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-results-live-clinton-trump?view=map&type=presidential
people are underestemating gambit just cause they are relatively new to high tier. But they've shown that they came here to play and i wouldn't be surprised if they beat vp.\n
If I just took off with my moms car I would be fucking dead. Even if it was just 1 hour.
yeah I saw some of that as well. I just think the judges and contestants in australia are just so down to earth and most are really nice people. Also no uneccessary drama.
watch flusha he has insane HE usage
from 2012...
AZR gonna comeback in second map, he is a really good player :) Everyone has shitty games.
that looks sick, man. Specs? :D
or you answer, they don't hear the answer and get mad. You answer back annoyed. Then they get extra mad for you talking back in an annoyed voice... Can't expect me to hear you calling from the opposite side of the house when i'm listening to music with headphones on goddamnit.
You'll never be good at the game without nades, so take that as you will.
played lol since beta. at least at the start you didnt get shit on when you picked your favourite char. you just got shit on if you fed. Now you have 3 people hating you just in champ select.
no, anyone can learn how to play the piano, or any instrument. The more you play the easier playing things becomes. If You're new to piano this will take you a while to learn how to play, whereas someone whos played for years wont need as long to learn it. People learn at varying degrees though.
Na has a reason when they are better. \n\nTop 10 in the world has 2 Na teams and 1 BR team. 7 EU teams.
>dumpster fire of a campaign\n\nCan we really say this after he actually won though?
As I am was used for multiple IEM events
how is that any different than any other insults?
so far just as good as S2 at least
she definitely won the debate just by ignoring him most of the time, but I felt like she wasnt even there, she just stated her rehearsed policies again and again, no personality. Trump got attention, which is what he wants. He doesnt want to sway hillary voters he wants to get those who are not sure, and most will probably remember trump instead of hillary.
EU actually had a reason to talk shit about Na though. As EU has had the superior teams forever. Denmark, Sweden, France, Poland, Russia and Ukraine that is. and a few players scattered around the other countries. Happy that Na is starting to gain ground though.
such a great law. Do you know if there has been a decrease in smokers? Everyone I know just uses snus instead.
Oh, man. I hope I'll be able to create something half as nice someday. Will you post the finished pictures?
their biggest problem is obviously their current teamplay. Smithzz didnt straight out lose g2 any rounds. horrible teamplay did. you know smithzz wont topfrag. he is supposed to get some easy kills and tradefrags. G2 never even got to that position in these games though. Lack of strats on T side and bad teamplay on CT side. The only reason it got close was cause shox made 1vx's and 2vx's into 1v1s
should have put out a meme instead.
yeah, but this is NA rank S
dont let this win let you forget that liquid choked 2 maps in a row vs LG.
He did answer it though, by introducing taxes on products coming in from another country, so that the companies never leave.
Astralis was a finnish team back in the day, i believe that guardian was a finnish player. The current guardian played a bit of 1.6 and then switched over to source.
The biggest tournament is coming up in a week on the 22nd. Tune in for some great games :D
some parts of the community thinks ever tier1-2 pro is cheating.

Hollywood arent the only ones making movies though...
things are never easy vs. VP. especcially in majors. but I really hope gambit takes it. would be awesome!
I would say ScreaM was top3 with GTR and F0rest at one point on Verygames, he was a really amazing fragger before they nerfed his entire style.
yeah, optic is good t side overpass as well. they've played it a lot lately though, lets hope they have something new nip wont expect.
hosted on servers, in this case its hosted on ESEAs servers. Both teams agree on the server location pre-match
I think thats cause the people supporting Trump would rather have Trump than Hillary, no matter how the debates go. I don't live in the Us, but I know for a fact I would never vote Hillary in no matter what.
yeah WayLander looked completely defeated :(
TBF, they werent paid salary and the match didnt matter. Should still be punished, but it didnt really affect any tournaments or anything. it was just a really scummy move. 
I feel like debates like this are more for entertainment than actual debate. it seems hillary supporters twist trumps words and praise hillary. Trump supporters twists hillary's words and praise trump. Does it really convert anyone?
not a crime, just uninteresting. I'm not surprised by Trumps behavior. She knows she cant win if she stoops to his level, so she didnt. I learnt nothing from the two candidates that i didnt already know.
on what grounds? Nik0 has been extremely good for a long time now, a small dip at the end of 2016. Cold has a much better team where he really gets to shine. Cold, nik0, snax and device are all very complete players who can do everything(similar to olof in his prime). Saying any one of these is better than any other is wrong imo.
HuK was a SC2 pro back in the day for those who didnt know.
if youre gonna go b, you gotta smoke connector and throw some flashes out, a single molotov will stop the push. And A is a really easy site to take as optic has shown this t-side. Its also fairly hard to hold B as its easy to flank and the cts will come from A, so you have to defend from everywhere. it's the same on A, but it's easier to defend as you can hide so many places.
its a couple months ago I think, I just hadnt played in a long time and when I got back the spray was different. Still havent bothered to practice it again :D
GE is decent at the game. Pro is like polishing everything about your play.
http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2016/08/15308/ this one? I can't see that it was reverted. It doesnt change the pattern itself, but it has more spread.
Having other players doing their job will help you get kills as well. nik0 cant trust his teammates to hold their position. SK's players are all really good and will most of the time play correctly, almost always trade frags. Mouz literally only has nik0 and sometimes chris. Unless nik0 gets 3ks, 4ks or 5ks. mouz will lose a round most of the time. You can't compare nik0 and colds role in their respective teams. \n\nI am a big fan of Ex6tenz and VG, so I was following titan. KennyS at that time was the best player in the world because all his teammates would do everything to put him in the best possible position to carry games, Ex6tenz' setups were designed for Kenny, meanwhile Nik0 is the IGL* for mouz, he doesnt have the same setup he did. \n\nAnd Kenny couldnt carry alone. Apex had to have a good game for it to work, similar to chrisJ. Most extremely shown in the fnatic titan match where kenny dropped 50 kills and still lost the game. Not to mention every team is generally better than they were 2-3 years ago. \n\nYou also failed to respond to my claims that dev1ce and snax were equal to Cold. Nik0 is not on a top team, therefore you cannot compare him directly to any of these players. \n\nIf you put a great player with a great team, he will play amazingly and get amazing results, The impact frags he gets will get followed up on. If you put a great player with a bad team, he will be the only positive for that team, and the only times his impact kills will be followed up on is if they're followed up by himself.
im global and my spray control is absolute garbage after the update.
yeah, I dont consider 1-7 a spray, more like a long burst. It's when you get to the 15th or so bullet I start to have problems.
So, is this just something symbolic? Or does it actually mean anything... 
Hence it not being in my original comment, and subsequently being redacted. You're right. It was a mistake to add w/ the edit. I stand by my original comment. 
Are those both the same person?
it's absolutely beyond my level of comprehension... I really don't know how it could work unless they orbit in unison; maybe that's the case. Hopefully someone much smarter than me can provide some insight.

it was difficult to hear for me too, but my understanding was that he was asking if since the planets are so close, would it be possible or at least wise to consider the possibility of there being a biosphere that extends across multiple planets versus singular, individual atmospheres.

No, I'm just saying that the parties literal platform says gay marriage shouldn't be allowed (that every child deserves a mom and a dad who are married, etc.). You can  argue that specific GOP members don't buy into this, but the parties actual platform does, so... it's safe, to me, to say the GOP is anti-LGBT regardless of it comes off as painting with a broad brush. \n\nhttps://www.gop.com/platform/renewing-american-values/ \n\nedit: typos, context

Not that he's particularly *high* on the list, but I'm a little surprised at how high Nixon is on here. Perhaps I'm young and ignorant to his presidency, but my understanding was that he was pretty well hated even before Watergate.

Pence and Ryan aren't in charge... Bannon is. Doy. 
I grew up in rural Missouri in a county that, I'm fairly certain, has never voted blue, ever. I know a thing or two about anti-LGBT conservatives. Am I painting with a broad brush? Sure. Does the GOP have a platform that is clearly against LGBT rights and marriage equality? Yes. 
And just like that my desire to take his phone away vanished... 
>Historians gave Obama high marks for pursuing equality, managing the economy, public persuasion and “moral authority.” On the other hand, he was judged to have been below-average in handling international relations.\n\nI'm no presidential historian, but in my personal opinion, I'd say this assessment is spot on.

No one gives a shit. 
But this isn't a conspiracy. It's just calling out hypocrisy. Whatever. Have your fun, really doesn't matter to me. Both Trump AND Clinton are fucking terrible humans. I don't need to spend my time here to see that. 
That's because it doesn't make sense at all. 
wow. I had no idea. Is it safe to assume that's some kind of record? 
Me on McConnell: Please die already. 
I disagree. I think I fully admitted and acknowledged HRC's corruption - I never insinuated she didn't want the power. I actually said their family is an example of greedy and power hungry people using their greedy and power hungry friends to get ahead. Perhaps your lens wants to skew what I'm saying to fit your narrative. I literally even said Clintons and Trump are one in the same and both are despicable people. I also said if she WERE in office, that there WOULD be all those leaks you desire. But she's not, so Trump, who is, is the one under the microscope now. View what you'd like, I guess. \n\nEdit: If it's just the semantics you're tied up on and you need to see the word "conspiracy" from me, then fine. It's a conspiracy. Have fun with that. 
At least men will actually pay attention to her.

[Ohio gets a lot of attention on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/5u13k9/the_state_of_ohio_is_shaped_like_a_human_colon/)
I get what you're saying - I'm not going to dispute that a lot, not all, of media leans at least *slightly* left. But frankly, I feel like I have seen HRC drama in the news most of my life, so I'm not sure I'd agree that she is treated better than Trump. I think if HRC were president, we'd be seeing *a fuck ton* of leaks on her. But the fact is, Trump is president, so he's the one under the public microscope now. Just my two cents. I don't like any corrupt politicians, right or left. It's not a partisan issue for me. My original point was, though, I was hoping to see something other than politics in this thread, and I feel like that is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Keeping up with the circus that is American Politics is exhausting; it's everywhere I look. \n\nEdit: Also worth mentioning that while a lot of media leans left, that Trump definitely gets hit harder than just about any other right-leaning president would get. I think that's obvious, but frankly, I think he brings 90% of it on himself. It's indisputable in my mind that his demeanor brings a lot of the shit he catches on to himself. He continually insults people, gets unnecessarily, obnoxiously defensive, and has projected many false-truths. If you do that and behave that way, you better expect the media to attack you. Not saying it's right or wrong. Just that it makes sense. 
alright man. you win. 
I fully agree it's crossing a line, but frankly, I'm *less* annoyed if it's symbolic only and doesn't really "impose" on others to believe/practice what they want freely. This coming from someone who doesn't believe in any form of higher, divine being or power. \n\nUltimately just seems pointless to begin with, if you ask me. 
It's just a quote. The quote says skim, so I wrote skim. I'm not denying skimmed is proper.

#wouldnotbang
Perhaps. I think that family just uses their connections and wealth to push themselves to the top, honestly. It's not secret that a ton of life long lefties (myself included) walked away from the DNC this year because of all the bullshit going on behind closed doors. Politics in general is a giant shit-show of corruption, collusion, and smoke-screening. Maybe I'm too cynical, but I really don't think it's anything other than greedy, power hungry assholes being greedy, power hungry assholes. That's why me, personally, really liked Bernie. I felt for the first time in my voting-eligible life that there was someone who was *genuine* about what he was saying and wasn't afraid to step on his parties toes to say it. You could argue Trump does that, but I'd argue he is anything but genuine. I personally believe he wants the office for nothing more than power and wealth. He's already profiting like a mother fucker from being in office. China Patents. Hotel expansions. etc. The Clinton's are no better - I'm not disputing that. I just don't see much of a difference in Trump. \n\n\nEdit: Anyways, I should probably get back to work since I've sat on reddit for about an hour straight now. Thanks for the chat - it's nice to have an actual conversation with someone who may not agree with you without being called a shill or a shariablue or whatever else comes out of t-d these days. Sadly, I feel that is also rare on reddit these days (from both sides, to be clear). 
essentially, yes. 
We need to just stop giving this stupid, lying woman any attention at all. She is fucking scum and deserves nothing. 
r/unexpected 
No. 
I'd say it's both, personally.
That's really stupid as hell, the DNC leaks are all hashed and can be verified as unedited by Google. Lol
***confused laugh***
Creepier than what the other dude said. You went deep into his history, into weird-status. Good job.
At higher res than 1080p or if you downsample to 1080p, it makes ALL the difference. Some effects rely on VRAM too.
The seagull was also the default method for stopping pirates with the FADE antipiracy system. About to attack Nogova as Force Recon Marines on a pirated copy? Put a bird on it, thief.
But Wikileaks is absolutely fine when they're leaking against the Bush administration. And they'll be great to you when the Trump leaks/scandals start appearing. But right now, they're FAR RIGHT CONSPIRACY THEORISTS!!!!11!1!
They need to fucking suck it up and settle down just like Native Americans during Manifest Destiny. Yes, this WAS your land, and now due to white people (and Jews) it's not. "GET OVER IT."\n\nFucking barbaric. Freedom for Palestine. Israel is illegal.
They didn't have the funding in the first place? Saudi money. Which is American money. Which killed Americans in 9/11. Inside job? Dunno. Blood on our own hands for it? YES.
>Everyone on Trump's staff that was on the Sunday shows yesterday stated\n\nYou lost me. [Sorry.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/) [[Source 2]](http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5)\n\nIf it's on "da sunday shows" then it's possibly fake news.
Which is a stupid thing to link since I love Jews. I love Arabs. This "article" tries so DAMN hard to pigeonhole **KNOWING THAT ISRAEL IS ILLEGAL AND NO SURROUNDING COUNTRIES AGREED WITH IT'S CREATION** into actually meaning **"I HATE JEWS!!!"** \n\nI hate that my country makes millions on the dead bodies of brown people, in part by selling weapons to and giving aid to countries like Israel to further the displacement, colonization and killing that imperialism requires. \n\nGood and evil don't actually exist in the world, but you're going to be an apologist for the imperialists and murderers in this world. Inb4 HAMAS ROCKETS OVER TEH BORDAR!11 because HOLY SHIT would I retaliate as well if I were a Palestinian man.
Only the "richest" with multiple cards should buy 144hz monitors. I bought a discount one (GN246HL) and regret it. 1440p @60-120hz is more manageable even than a 1080 @144hz. It's excessive, and in my testing of 144hz vs strobed 120hz there is no latency difference.
Getting above about 71 FPS on a 60hz monitor is useless, friend. There is some framerate "give" to be had at the millisecond-level by running slightly above 60 FPS on a 60hz monitor but it's not enough to worry about. This is the root of my argument. 60hz ceiling means you can push games to the max and they will run, look and FEEL perfect. 60 FPS on my 144hz looks like shit. ANYTHING below about 138 FPS looks like shit. It's not worth it.
4 will feel much more futuristic gameplay-wise than V. People say the gameplay/gunplay is perfected in V but it just feels legitimately like Chaos Theory or another newer Splinter Cell game to me. MGS4 still feels incredible with the amount of stances, movement speed animations and CQC. ESPECIALLY the CQC.
Us vs them politik keeping us divided as usual. Good job, keep doing your part.\nWhat a waste.
What point are you making? Trump will somehow strengthen the oligarchy MORE than Clinton?
Other side? Leftists and progressives make up a bulk of those pizzagate researchers. Clod.
Debbie Wassermann Schultz was made to resign once the emails were leaked via Wikileaks. Evidence is there for collusion against Bernie. Thank Russia for any involvement of telling us the truth if they're somehow involved (they're not, as a nation)
Tribute game with chibis is the only real game imo
savage find, gary
That was fucking amazing. Should I watch the first, first?
Evidence of Russia as a state cybernetically attacking the US for the DNC leaks. We are ALL WAITING ON EVIDENCE.
Cracking the fuck up at*
Don't be a clod, it's not believing ArsTechnica over anybody else, it's all about reading between the lines, looking at the details. Ars was one of the proper journalism outlets actually reporting on the scarcity of real info in the JAR. Definitely agree to disagree. I wonder if you would've defended Bush/Powell and their push for the Iraq weapon of mass destruction narrative.
It's not that the displays refresh rate is the problem, it's if his hardware can DRIVE the results he wants. 1080/1440p with an Iris pro on games like LoL at medium to high settings will be fine. Higher will require low settings and/or framerate concessions.
GTAV feels way less kinetic and dynamic than GTAIV.\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GWVtZJo-HqI
So you're aware, it's objectively useless to have your games run above about 65 or so frames per second due to the 60hz displays on Apple products. You can treat yo self with some graphics bumps on CS:GO...
That's pretty gross. :/
It can be done, but it won't be a typical ArmA 3 gameplay scenario. Probably a sparse/small map and lower view distance. Definitely not looking at Doom levels of framerate, but entirely different techs here. Again, I forgot to link it but if you have the same monitor this will change your life:\n[here is the link](http://www.blurbusters.com/zero-motion-blur/lightboost/)
I play with a 980Ti and get around 150 with Doom on ultra settings/1080. That's not a good example imo. Neither is CS:GO. I'm talking about GTAV, ArmA 3, and similar- games known to get above 60 FPS easily on high end hardware but nowhere near 144 FPS on the highest settings. I don't want to compromise, that's why I spent what I spent on my hardware. My monitor forces my hand and I hate that. 1440p/60hz would've been sublime. Also, here's how to to the Lightboost workaround and get 120hz strobed (new HDTVs come with a smooth gaming mode that is just strobing the backlight) on your 144hz monitor. It also means games only have to run at 120hz, which is a bit of leeway. Edit: whoops [here is the link](http://www.blurbusters.com/zero-motion-blur/lightboost/)

>Date\t634–638\n\nI'm actually cracking up about how you think this is relevant information for modern civilization or modern multinational politics at all. In fact, by your logic, where's the multinational task force to remove non-native Americans and insert/settle true tribal native Americans in the US? Australia? Where are they? So stupid. What's next, **quoting the bible or other religious texts as proof of the validity of Jews displacing Palestinians?**  Would expect it.\n\nThe illegal nation of Israel happened in the 40's. It's recently illegal. It can change. It should change. Displaced Palestinians will know justice someday. \n\nAs an American... it just feels so *wrong* to be on this side of history, part of the imperialism that kills millions globally.
Yep! "Fake news" is being pushed as a narrative in our culture so *fucking* hard right now because of Pizzagate.
You would've defended the Bush administration invading Iraq for the made-up weapons of mass destruction. I know you would have. There were all kinds of "TOTALLY REAL" reports of evidence with this new JAR with the same amount of content as what we've all heard before: un-cited, anonymous experts. There are and always will be people like you who are uninvested in current events/world news but will parrot what they hear in mainstream media outlets because you think you're doing the right thing.
SC already has great playable content that delivers more than Elite does for me. Aka I can get out of my ship at any god damn time and explore or have FPS combat etc. \n\nStar Citizen is playable. Coming updates (2017) are adding planetary landings, jobs/skills and more game mechanics. \n\nAgain, you can literally have a more engrossing experience in the current 2.5 alpha than a lot of new games coming out. Needs to be reiterated because the meme of SC being a white whale is fuckin dumb.
>That said, Sanders was a lifetime independent and running as a Democrat was probably the dumbest thing he could've done\n\nStopped reading here. Bernie consistently filled stadiums when Hillary couldn't fill warehouses. The collusion against him is transparent thanks to the leaks. The line that without superdelegates she would have had an inkling of a chance against Bernie is laughable.\n\nEdit: the person I replied to had paragraphs on paragraphs of apologism on why Bernie running as Dem or against Clinton was bad. Did I just de-shill the thread?
Not really at all? The game has turning speed thresholds. You can actually set your mouse sensitivity all the way up and still get the same limitations. I think it's viable and fun with HOTAS but I use M+KB.
As posted below: [EFF.org TPP info](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp)\n\nSorry, I just want to hinder the disgusting misinformation and apologism displayed by Salkovich here for the TPP, an **incredibly** anti-individual trade agreement. Get the hell out of here.
Not an eGPU. Still quite an investment that's EVEN MORE not worth it since Apple chose medium-end parts as always (4GB Radeon 460 as the highest-end, lmfao).
I haven't been able to think about cheese pizza without the idea that pedos use it in real life to identify each other and help each other out popping up in my head and making me kind of ill. It truly is eye-opening. Regardless of your feelings about pizzagate, pedophiles **use "cheese pizza" to talk about child-adult "love."**
There's no forgeign nation attacking us. In fact, that big report all over the front page a day or so ago by the US Govt is being criticized hard because there's no actual cited evidence (lots of talk of "high certainty" instead) saying Russia as a state leaked the Podesta files. Preposterous and foolish to try and start a war with fucking RUSSIA over the DNC/political establishment trying to sweep the dust of the skeletons in the closet back under the rug.
You literally sound sore about Bernie. Clintons failings are on the DNC, not voters. If the DNC- yes, not voters but the *DNC*- would have hand-chosen (ala Clinton) a better candidate then we would have President Sanders. Period.
Hilarious that it lists Wikileaks, with it's evidenced and hashed-by-Google-themselves actual email leaks and the like. Can't NOT be real.
Since the real implementation by Capcom in PSVR is as hacked-on feeling as vorpX (using your head to aim like an Apache chopper gunner) this will probably be way authentic in that way and look incredible compared to PSVR.
Wait, what? Pro-Russia, like it's bad to support another world power as a country or something? Mainstream media is drumming up 'dem cold war feels too hard, shit like this popping up on Reddit is **SO** surreal. DAMN *RED* RUSKIE COMMIE BASTARD RUSSIAN COMRADE RUSKIES! Holy shit lmfao they had nothing to do with the DNC email leaks btw, aka "election hacks" get real
Nancy Pelosi could be a very dire pick what with the whole Goat Hill Pizza thing. Podesta files and all that.
***P R O J E C T I N G***
Ah, fuck it. I YOLO'd some petty cash on this one. I wish us luck.
Wikileaks emails are security hashed and can be proven as true by Google. Sorry if that fucks with your narrative?

The argument is that there's no real argument against protesting this or, really, the previous 6 administrations or so. We are tired of the ignorance, the oligarchy and economic strife. It's only called class warfare when the non-elite start fighting back. Again, I don't believe you have a *valid argument* against protests like these- ones in the name of "science"/anti-ignorance or women's rights or black rights or anything similar.

Real leftists are against the state of Israel and any other nation that imposes harmful religious doctrine into law on it's people? Just how it is. Your boogeyman "leftists" comment is silly.
There is no russian interference in our electoral process, they're referencing the Guccifer DNC email leaks and those were actually GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE and not tied to the Russian state. You're really soaking in the MSM line.
It's nowhere near the same. There's extensive developer documentaries talking about getting the animations and feeling of the gunplay in MP3 just right and essentially perfect for a physics-dictated third person shooter with shoot dodging. It's kind of a perfect game, gameplay wise imo. Lots of hours in MP on PC, free aim only.

>I got Alex Jones links\n\nAnd I'm getting George Soros vibes. Begone, you've been given the evidence.
Wikileaks was a really great resource when they were leaking against Republicans. Telling the world how the Democrats are really just a corporate-fellating operation just like Repugs and how they rigged against Bernie (America's last hope?!?!? Good job) to make sure their chosen candidate was *the* chosen candidate. \n\n*"Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don’t have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists"* -Debbie Wasserman Schultz
Lmfao, true progressives and leftists like myself are just as against establishment crony capitalism as the conservatard crowd you think anybody anti-Hillary is. There's LOTS in the emails. Multiple people lost their jobs because of the emails. That doesn't happen when there's no wrongdoing.

I get your angle but honestly even Windows 10 gets me more productivity on my 2013 MBPR than macOS. I can run apps that utilize the i7/GPU better and games run better or just run at all on Windows 10. It's a requirement to me to dual boot it or a distro of Linux for when macOS is being problematic or basic (the latter is so egregious- Apple used to be BEST for creative pros and other OSs and hardware outpace them now)
Of course she fuckin voted for it, she has little difference between the other Corporate Republicans and Corporate Democrats propagating our oligarchy. It's not really Republican vs Democrat- it's the elite versus the 99%. Sanders publicly addressed and had fundamentally sound plans to dismantle the oligarchical hold on our country but that was snuffed via *SUPERDELEGATES* designed to stop grassroots, people-powered candidates from succeeding in DNC/RNC primaries. State these facts and invite anybody to prove you wrong.
[Hell no.](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/12/did-russia-tamper-with-the-2016-election-bitter-debate-likely-to-rage-on/) \n\nImportantly:\n\n"*Sadly, the JAR, as the Joint Analysis Report is called, does little to end the debate. Instead of providing smoking guns that the Russian government was behind specific hacks, it largely restates previous private-sector claims without providing any support for their validity. Even worse, it provides an effective bait and switch by promising newly declassified intelligence into Russian hackers' "tradecraft and techniques" and instead delivering generic methods carried out by just about all state-sponsored hacking groups.*"

AMD has aged better due to using better hardware if anything. DX12 benefits versus Nvidia Pascal from the past couple gens of AMD are evident of this. Actually, I would say the opposite is true re: drivers... Nvidia Control Panel gives so much power and has for so long it's hard not to recommend.
I think the best response to all the "hacking/rigging by Russia" absolute-nonsense is to indeed say "GOOD! We needed to know that the elites colluded against the man who would be president right now."
Ya'll are astroturfing shit real hard here. I encourage anybody to follow Pizzagate info by looking for the Voat pizzagate community. It was migrated there. The thing that triggered it wasn't a fucking pizza party invitation or something, it was using PIZZA as codeword. "A black and white handkerchief with a pizza-related map" was left by Podesta in a hotel or resort and that is the original lead. Anything else, including the police artists renderings of the men who kidnapped Madeline Mcann looking like John and Tony Podesta **to the T** as well as Podesta's emails backing up his being out of country around the time she was kidnapped/sold by her parents. I'm a hardcore leftist who's been following and propagating any of this research/investigation etc.
You think we've been moving left while the rest of the civilized world views our "most left" mainstream politicians as center at best. What?
Laughable. Nobody in Trump's staff or cabinet is credible. They took the oligarchical ideals of the last 20 years and straight up just put the lobbyists and former execs in the relevant political positions.\n\n**Fuck no it's not enough evidence.** We want real evidence. Anything they've said so far holds no water. If ESET could find the truth, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike (private firm used for the J.A.R) does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will.
That doesn't include everything in your documents and desktop folder, it's totally optional. You can use iCloud Drive without that caveat. you probably just went "yeah yeah yeah" when the dialog popped up asking if you wanted Drive to sync documents and desktop when setting up \n\n*rolleyes*
Right now, I'd buy AMD because of DX12 viability. AFAIK the Skyrim remaster is DX11 so you'd actually get better performance with that 1060. Think of it that way. I have a 980 Ti so I'm sweating. DX12 is obviously the next step/the future.

My carpentry skills aren't great either, but about 10 years ago I built a full (aka double) size half-loft (3ft clearance below) bed and I still use it every day.

[Well, that's just demonstrably incorrect information](http://traffic.findlaw.com/traffic-tickets/illegal-u-turn-state-laws.html). The laws vary by state and many states *actually prohibit* U-turns at an intersection (e.g. [Oregon](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors811.html)) unless signs indicate otherwise. In my own state of Washington for example, U-turns are governed by [two rules](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.295): It has to be safe, and you need to have at least 500 feet of visibility if doing so near the crest of a hill. That's it. Those are the U-turn rules for Washington state. Can make a U-turn more or less anywhere I want.
The way a toilet (at least in the US) functions is by way of a siphon mechanism. If you continue feeding it with water once the flush has begun, it will continue to drain out. The flushing only stops when the siphon has been mostly emptied.
There are lots of laws that intersect with ethics. You can't be completely unethical while remaining within the law.

> I would love to know how many Trump supporters minds you have changed.\n\nIf I'm in those discussions, I don't walk away. I've started those discussions. "What convinced you to vote for Trump?" or "Now that Trump is elected, what are you hoping to see in his first 100 days?" or "Is there anything Trump could do to disappoint you as President?" -- the important thing is to listen to what people say; not just to wait for your turn to speak, but to *actually listen* to what they are saying. Try to understand their perspective.\n\nChange doesn't often happen in the blink of an eye, it's usually incremental. For many of the people who hold positions opposite your own, you're trying to undo a belief rather than knowledge, and that is hard because a belief isn't rooted in facts like knowledge is. Presenting facts doesn't change the mind of a believer, it has to be framed appropriately and you have to make them feel differently in order to see any movement at all. [You may find this useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM).
I've got a cousin in Memphis, and when I was there a few years ago for his wedding I was shocked at what kind of house I could get for $300k; in my area, $300k might get you a smallish 2 bedroom condo. I'm surprised to hear that the median income is so high there in Memphis and yet it doesn't seem to have ballooned housing costs like it has here (Seattle metro area).

He's trading options. An option is a contract that enables you to buy ("call") or sell ("put") a given stock (the "underlying") at a specific price. Options have a lot more volatility than stocks and they can swing wildly in value on small changes of the underlying stock's price. Options have a limited lifespan and do not last forever. Options trading is *basically* gambling. Getting access to options trading usually requires jumping through some hoops regardless of which brokerage you use; you usually have to call them, answer some questions, and then they have the option (heh) to not approve you for options trading if they don't like the answers you gave.\n\nIt is not by any means *reasonable* to think that you could get $10k from a $200 investment. It is absolutely *possible* but it is not *reasonable*. This sub is called wallstreet**bets**; u/fscomeau is making a **bet**. If you're comfortable walking up to a roulette table and putting $200 on #1 and letting it ride, then options trading is for you. If the thought of your $200 becoming $0 in the time it takes the roulette to come to a stop bothers you, then options trading is not for you.
It looks to be an identical light, aside from branding. Are there any differences?\n\nEdit: answered my own question. Has a different emitter, more neutral in color (5000K instead of the 6000-6500K the SF-348 has) but is otherwise the same. There were options with/without engraving too, but is otherwise the same light. Shame they're only available as group-buy preorders and are currently OOS.

The other 2 comments are wrong. It's a customizable value, though, and *could* be 3 if somebody has changed it, or if they have upgraded from a previous version of Office where it was 3. On a fresh install of Excel 2016, though, it's only one. More information can be found [here](http://www.officetooltips.com/excel_2016/tips/changing_the_number_of_sheets_for_new_workbooks.html), and you can click through the different version numbers to see what it says about them (2010: "Excel automatically creates **three** worksheets in each new workbook", 2013: "Excel 2013 automatically creates **one** worksheet in each new workbook", 2016: "Excel 2016 automatically creates **one** worksheet in each new workbook")
Absolutely agree. FI means "don't need to work anymore." It means you can spend a year unemployed while searching out the job you want, if that's what you want to do. It means you are beholden to nobody except yourself. It means you can pursue desires instead of necessities.

Using the "American Legends" coupon for 2 large pizzas, the total is $25.98. (excluding tax)\n\nUsing the "2 mediums" coupon, with the same toppings, the total is $34.24. (excluding tax)\n\nA large pizza has 154 square inches of surface area. A medium has 113 square inches of surface area. So with the 2 large pizzas (308 square inches), you're getting a little under 3 medium pizzas (339 square inches) of crust, for less than what 2 mediums would cost.\n\nAn added bonus is that the "American Legends" coupon guarantees the price of the pizza regardless of the toppings, but the "2 mediums" deal does not, and the price can fluctuate as you add/remove toppings. Consistent pricing is helpful for budgeting.

I threw some spare change at a similar YOLO as his (AAPL puts at $5 intervals, doubling quantities at each interval). I hope we both win. The difference though is that I threw a fraction of a percent of my portfolio into this, whereas this is a make or break moment for u/fscomeau. 
I searched this thread for "Dominos" and this is the only comment I found. \n\nSo, here's another Dominos glitch in the system for you: You can use their "1 Large American Legends Pizza for $12.99" coupon, pick out an American Legends Pizza, then before you add it to your cart it will ask if you want to make any changes; swap all the toppings for what you actually want, in the quantities you desire, at no extra charge. Effectively, 1 large pizza with anything you want for $12.99. I've used this "glitch in the system" recently.
We're seeing this attitude disproven with the EMDrive; the idea that somebody with life-changing ideas/technology will become instantly rich. It's always an incremental process.
It doesn't matter if it's normal. It matters if it's what you want. I'm a bit of a hermit, so not having people show up expecting to visit or be entertained is totally fine with me.

About 14 years ago, I bought a 1988 4WD Chevy Blazer for $350. It had some body damage and was the vehicle that the owner would take to go hunting with his son, but his son had moved away for college and the owner had stopped going hunting, so the Blazer just sat for a couple years. The only stipulation was that I had to return the tires to him, which were special/expensive tires made for off-roading. So, I ended up finding a set of 4 tires on craigslist for $100 and had a local tire shop swap the tires for me for a few bucks. Total cost under $500. I drove that Blazer for 3 years.

The last 5 episodes of Season 8 are pretty good, IMO. Threads, episode 18, is one of my favorites.
The coupon is $12.99 for 1 large. Compared with 1 large, then the 2 mediums might be a better deal, if you don't add any toppings. The $12.99 coupon is nice because you can load up on toppings and still only pay $12.99 for a large pizza. I compared 2 larges with 2 mediums to emphasize that the $12.99 coupon scales a lot better, especially if you liberally add toppings.
> Now she's on a pro-Assad crusade.\n\nSort of like how we should've been on a Pro-Hussein crusade, to prevent the creation of the power vacuum that has been filled by ISIS? She's on a pro-Assad crusade because the "Syrian Rebels" we've been supporting/arming are Al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda, which Tulsi Gabbard found out by [*going to Syria*](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/18/democratic-rep-gabbard-makes-secret-trip-to-syria/).
You have to re-partition the disk. \n\n1. Open [Disk Management](http://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/7-ways-to-open-disk-management-in-windows-10.html)\n2. Find your disk in the list in the upper pane of the middle section\n3. Right-click your disk and pick "Delete Volume..." and delete all of the volumes on the disk. \n4. Right-click the disk and pick "Create Volume..." to make a new volume and format it.\n\nIf you think of a hard drive being like a house, then you can think of partitions being like rooms in that house and formatting being like drywall, paint, and flooring. You can divide a house up into as many rooms as you want (create multiple partitions on the disk) and paint them any color you like (different formats) before putting all your stuff (your files) in the house. When you create the bootable USB drive to install windows, it creates a special partition on the drive that contains only the installation files; If you used a drive that already contained stuff you needed, it'd be like somebody coming into your house, tearing out all of the insides, and replacing them all with a single closet that contains a small toolbox and a bicycle.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nPS: Make sure you select the right disk! Deleting partitions is dangerous!

An ETF is a safer investment because it "builds in" the primary rule of investing: **diversify your assets!** \n\nWhen investing for growth, it's wise to invest in multiple companies, involved in multiple industries, across multiple sectors, in order to ensure that a supply shortage doesn't kill your entire portfolio. For instance, if you were invested heavily in Intel, AMD, Toshiba and Samsung (25% each) but there was a global shortage of Silicon, the stock price of all four would likely suffer. While you did diversify by company, they all have the same upstream resource dependency (Silicon) and a shortage on that dependency is detrimental to all four companies.\n\nAn ETF can index many companies, industries and sectors. Not all ETFs are diversified across all groups; some ETFs are just company-diversified but are still focused on a particular sector or industry (e.g. VNQ, a real-estate ETF). Other ETFs encompass entire indices, like SPY which tracks the S&P 500 and contains multiple companies from multiple different sectors (industrials, tech, pharmaceuticals, financials, etc.).

Are you one of the top 1%? How do you know how much cash they keep on hand?\n\nEdit: Getting downvoted for this comment, so I thought I'd elaborate. The top 1% wear wristwatches worth more than most people's annual salary. They wear cufflinks worth more than most people make every month. While they may not have a fat wad of $100 bills in their pocket, many of them are definitely carrying around more than $10k in some form or another.
Pro: Don't have to worry about basic necessities. They say that money doesn't buy happiness, but that's not actually true; money up to a point *does* buy happiness, but the returns diminish rapidly thereafter. [This has been studied](http://www.alternet.org/story/153887/the_fascinating_scientific_reason_why_%22money_doesn't_buy_happiness%22).\n\nCon: The decisions I make on a daily basis could end up costing my company millions--or even billions--of dollars if I make the wrong choice. This doesn't cause me a whole lot of stress or anxiety, but dealing with this level of responsibility on a regular basis bleeds over into the rest of my life, and I sometimes weigh my options too seriously or take longer to make a decision than is really necessary.
Just speculation, but: Different material demands, different thermal demands, different environmental demands. For instance, maybe there are airfoils that fit the bill and perform great in California, but won't do so well on, say, Mars, or Antarctica.

Unpopular opinion time!\n\nIn the simplest terms, the news media **is** the enemy of the people. It wasn't always this way, but it is today. The quest for higher ratings and more advertising dollars has absolutely killed journalism in the last 30 years. The invention of the cable news network has ruined journalism at its core. False reports that are made in haste to be the "first" rather than the "best"; reporting on the lives of celebrities instead of politics or economics; reporting on movie grosses and new releases instead of the latest famine, genocide, or other item that people should *probably* be aware of.\n\nThat said, the media is just catering to their audience. There's a limited number of eyeballs and a limited number of advertiser dollars and the news media is trying to maximize their income by being first and reporting all of the things that most people (unfortunately) want to hear about. If they started reporting real news, people would just watch reruns of Friends or something.\n\nOf course, this isn't what Trump meant by his tweet.
In the USA: Generally speaking, coins with ridged edges and a year of 1964 or prior, are 90% silver by weight; this includes Dimes, Quarters, and Half-Dollars.

Here's the question: when do you want to retire? Your savings habits are **fantastic** for your age. If you can keep up such a conservative lifestyle you could see yourself comfortably retired in under 20 years. It looks like your annual expenses are about $5200, so keep $2600 or so in a savings account as an emergency fund and put the rest into an investment account as /u/CrackinACold1 suggested. I'm of the opinion that an emergency fund should only ever be adjusted up and never down--which is to say that if your expenses increase then your emergency fund should proportionally increase, but if your expenses decrease don't decrease the size of the emergency fund. I don't know enough about the Australian financial system or markets to make any specific recommendations, but you should consider taking up /u/CrackinACold1 on their offer of pointers.

Not that I have any business chiming in her but as a web dev, I vomit a little thinking of going back to the days of UI generated by a tool for me. Pure code is the only way to go. I dabbled in iOS dev for a bit and always got frustrated with IB and thought that was the only way and actually stopped doing it because I had the same frustrations as the author. I may dig back in knowing it's easier now with swift.
Fuck.
Ah that makes sense. US regulation would be a major hamper where China might not.
Thank you for that! I always wondered why I have sparse red in my beard and none on my head. This article helped a little but your explanation seems more correct. By any chance do you know if the red hair is more susceptible to going grey? In the last few years my red has seemed to vanish and is seemingly replaced with grey. It happened so subtly I didn't notice till recently my red is gone and perhaps they went grey.

The Tesla Show - A Tesla Podcast! I tried a few Tesla podcasts and this one was the only one I felt was worth my time. The two podcasters do a great job of balancing each other, asking hard questions and digging into the details. Highly worth your time to compress learning about Tesla and all things Model 3.
Those are absolutely fair points but the few times I have had to jump in and help with an iOS project for various reasons, the single thing I have struggled with merging was the Xib files after updating rather seemingly innocuous things. Maybe it's a non issue in reality because iOS apps are usually developed by small teams and if communication is good you can avoid editing the same Xibs, on a web app with a large team this is unavoidable and a real issue.\n\nI guess I have some more reading to do then, I was hoping based on the articles content there was something new in swift to facilitate learning how to build UI through code.

Yes, XIBs are stored in XML, but are the changes to the XML predictable or even comprehensible after a few changes in IB? \n\nModern Html and CSS is past divs and absolute positions, we have modern tags, semantics and relative positioning as well as support for specifying layouts with different media sizes like phones and tablets.\n\nYes the two are still different technologies but the line is blurred with javascript and MV* frameworks. My point is, the same as the author, changes are predictable and easier to comprehend when you do things by code.

I used Parse as a go to before they shut the doors. In theory you could roll your own with their open source parse server now but that may take a bit of work... Firebase seems to be solid and what is what I will be using next but some others I've heard people use is AWS and Urban Airship. Each comes with its own set of hurdles, pricing and limitations.

I think the type of dev you want largely depends on the environment, the former is a luxury only large organizations can support. I've worked in both environments and while the latter can be more stressful it is also much more rewarding. All of this is assuming a good dev of course.

Nope, I find the source of the information because I don't believe most headlines meant to spin a narrative. This is the article the number was pulled from and cites the culprits: http://fusion.net/story/17321/is-rape-the-price-to-pay-for-migrant-women-chasing-the-american-dream/\n\nAlso, first and second generation immigrants are less likely than citizens to commit crime: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07418825.2012.659200#/doi/full/10.1080/07418825.2012.659200\n\nSo your argument is families that are crossing over with a lot of rapists and they are getting raped while crossing to come to America. \n\nMy argument is Central American women (cited in the statistic) are crossing into Mexico first and are being taken advantage of by the controlling cartels and coyotes or even corrupt law enforcement as a means to help them continue their journey (cited in the article).\n\nWhich makes more sense?
I'm sure someone will jump in with a more detailed response but I wanted to help you get a leg up now. Sign up for an AWS account first and then go here: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdk-for-ios/\n\nThis link has the iOS SDK install link: https://aws.amazon.com/tools/\n\nAmazon has an iOS SDK which should take care of most of what you need to do. If you can program using the iOS SDK I think you can get around Amazons as well.\n\nYou mentioned Tokens in your post, they are a method of authentication you will need to use to secure communication between your app and AWS. Once you have an account you can generate a specific token for use with your app.\n\nGet to it!

I am out of my league here but based on my reading of his theory, he suggests that modern consciousness is learned through a complex language. Would it then be safe to say it is testable somehow by looking at how children perceive things, like their internal voice? And do we have an idea for when children "turn on" their consciousness?

His company Keyhole got bought out by Google in 2004 and is the basis for Google Earth. Since then he has been VP of the GEO division until Niantic was spun off.

It's funny because I am the minority in almost every facet of life and I would be hard pressed to find a white person in my social network that likes trump.\n\nEdit: I guess I am trying to illustrate that even though white people largely voted for him I am actually having a hard time finding people who voted for him other than some of my own family (who are also minorities). That is a topic for a different discussion.
With the car parking itself it makes this point moot. You only need that view when you are in control and need more information to park well. It's neat to demo, not useful if you have a AI chauffeur.

I want to hear more about how Pipi Long Stockings became a Spectre.
Numbers looking good so far? Have a link?
Makes sense. It works well, so continue using it to lower the cost over the long term.
So Honda omitted the fact there was 0.9% financing for 60 months as well as the stated 1.9% for 72 months when I went in to checkout a CRV this week. You might be able to get a lower rate but it will be less time to pay off. I checked my postal code for offers and saw there was 0.9% for accords but it's only for up to a 36 month loan.
When it eventually comes out you guys will be stoked!
Sorry man, that sucks. I'm kinda in the same situation where I live but I work in the city so I get both sides of it. You might want to try getting Ingress and after signing up look for "ingress map" on Google. Using this map, look for areas with XM. These areas aren't 1 to 1 with Pokemon spawn points but it should help narrow down the search. If your city is devoid of XM and portals, you can submit a request to Niantic for one with the "No pokestops or gyms near me" which they are looking to correct. The data is all from ingress and there are blind spots because it was crowdsourced so if no one in your town played Ingress you got screwed.
Thanks! Used!
Thank you! I don't get many Evees so I used the method hoping for success and it nailed it! Vaporeon first try!
Thank you for volunteering and participating!
And it has been sold!
I just got a 16 CRV last night too! I was super bummed about CarPlay as well. I did a lot of research and I saw the 15 had a limited beta to install it and after that it was kind of abandoned for the 16. Honda has claimed on Twitter that it's a hardware limitation and they are going to announce something soon. Since the 17 ridgeline got it I am assuming 17 CRV will get it too. Meh.
I think he is referring to the goal set by Elon on a call for investors. He said a date and then immediately said they would miss it because of the complex nature of their supply chain, but it was important to have the date regardless so that they can back everything into it and around it.
By who exactly? Coyotes? Gangs? Corrupt law enforcement? Or men also crossing the border along with them which are husbands relatives or their own children? Put yourself in those women's shoes. They have nothing, maybe they have children with them. Maybe a husband. They want what they think will be a better life. So they go through hell to cross. Who along that path can profit? Who along that path is vulnerable? Empathize and use logic for a minute and you will understand why assuming the men crossing the border with the women are the rapists. You will understand that the story is more complex than a simple statistic presented to you to push a narrative.
Where?!?\n\nEdit: maybe I got too excited for a bad joke... is the kids model s supposed to be the "compact model 3"?

Dude! Can we be best friends? Seriously nice car man. I looked up where the store is in Tempe and was surprised to find it was a block away from my old apartment complex in Tempe. Hoping I will be picking my 3 up this year at that same store.
Perfect!
You can still get apple care within 30 days of purchase from anyone, they just need to inspect the phone at apple. It's the 129 up front though instead of it baked in to the monthly cost. It's an option.
So they took a page straight from the Trump playbook huh? Poor form.

Yeah no clue... I imagine a store manager got to take it home?
I would be so happy if he didn't. That would be an amazing end to all of this.
So breaking laws = rapist?
I'm sure they really really want to but I'm also sure it will sweep the nation and cause massive server issues. I think the rollout was really smart but even it hasn't completely solved the scaling issues. I think Japan would rather wait till they could actually play instead of getting it and then having to wait for the servers to be scaled out to even login.
I imagine driving won't go away, but will eventually be like the stick shift, a premium and luxury.
Maybe hard to reach for most people? There is a gym out at a hiking trail outside of Phoenix and I imagine that would be a prime candidate for 21+ hour defense that I wanted to take but when I was there I was too low level.
Exactly. Some people don't care about any of this and just want lower taxes. They pretend they aren't voting for Trump because they feel bad about being associated but the desire to lower taxes is their only reason to vote.
This. I had the same issue with Google Calendar and birthdays.

And just like everything else related to Trump it's misrepresentation of data. It's a sad statistic but it doesn't mean that those crossing the border are rapists. It means that along their journey to America there are people taking advantage of them like gangs (cartel related or not) and corrupt law enforcement or even coyotes. People crossing the border are largely looking for a better life. Coyotes and gangs committing these crimes and violence aren't looking for a better life they are just taking advantage of the situation.\n\nThink it through logically. Does it make sense women would flee along with rapists over the border? Or does it make sense that along their journey they encounter people taking advantage of them because they are so desperate?
In addition Chet Faliszek from Valve tweeted just two weeks ago after talking to them about what's coming for GiantCop so it sounds like they were blindsided too. https://mobile.twitter.com/chetfaliszek/status/735991852961271808
End of the month is the best time to buy normally. Waiting to September is risky because of stock and arrival of next years models. When stock is low they can charge what they want if you really want that model. When stock is high and it's the end of the month they need to make their quotas for those bonuses. I bought a new CRV end of June and saved 2500 off MSRP by using edmunds.com like 5 days before the end of the month and got emails from every Honda dealer In my city and I would just call and see who could beat each other and went with the lowest. Hope this helps!
That's very specific... why oct 20th???

Here in Az we go through them once about every 2 years like clock work. At least that's been my luck and many other people I have talked to. The warrenty here in az usually covers a replacement so I end up paying for a new battery every 4 years. Got any tips on how to keep them running longer or is the heat in Phoenix completely at fault?
Elon posted they are going to upload a demo video, so software too! The legal system is going to have to figure this out fast!\n\nEdit: the blog post says it will be disabled till vetted, so it's ready but needs tons of validation.

I keep seeing callbacks to UT on Reddit and I really need to setup a server in UT99 and play again
The SNT-A unit was originally programmed to answer the young ones questions, and to find their greatest needs in their local communities, back on Earth. Back when there was an Earth. There remains one SNT-A unit aboard a long range vessel destined to reach the new world in 126 years. \n\nA young girl's Cryotube was accidentally set for 14 years, instead of the 140 years it would take since they left the barren planet. There is no way to enter deep sleep without a second operator. She tried for weeks. \n\nShe made friends with the SNT-A unit, learned all about the world she never knew, the seemingly limitless nature, the entwining world politics, the efforts to save the planet long gone, and cried over the world she'll never get to see, the one her friends and family will arrive to. \n\n"Tonight is the Eve of Christmas! What do you request for Christmas, little girl?" The SNT-A unit asked. The young girl sat upon the mechanical lap and thought for quite some time. Staring at the only friend she'll ever have. It was a request, and also, the only truth she had. "To die."\n\nEdit: I'm aware of the cheesiness and running theme of dead children and sorrow on this subreddit. If you use a little imagination, a six word story can mean many things :)

This reminds me, I went to Walmart *last week* to use their Coinstar machine. They had a Walmart greeter, not someone who looks even like AP, check every single persons receipt on the way out. The store was packed and he defended this door as if his job depended on it, making multiple people wait as he sifted through individual bags and checking receipts for customers who didn't even beep on the way out. I walked past him showing off my empty glass coin bottle in a subtle way that said "I have nothing to search for, and neither of us need to waste our time. "
Could be symbolic. Kenny's walls of secrets he's surrounded himself with are burning down. Or that a home represents safety, acceptance, trust, and it resonates with Kenny as he does not have that, and a burning house represents the rejection or inability to obtain those things at home.

I also loved when it became the background music. Really sets the theme for a nosedive, a downward spiral. Maybe one day they'll release the music for this show :)
And if it was her, you have to imagine she felt bad and embarrassed about it and at the least wanted to tell someone. 
Yes. Although, it's a bigger process on the iPhone. You simply need to go to the links on a computer, select your Apple device in the upper right hand corner of the website, and download these.

I love that in one of the theme songs for the show they use what sounds like mechanical drives for some of the sound
Nine Inch Nails is what I was going to say, but Trent has made much more music than Hurt that fits perfectly with Black Mirrors theme. Check out the music he made for films: The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Social Network, Gone Girl and his later albums like Ghosts and Year Zero which depicts a dystopian USA in 2022. \n\nHe also just helped create music for the documentary(?) Before The Flood which I've yet to see. \n\nHonorable mentions: Boards of Canada, Radiohead, Crystal Castles, Mogwai

Glad to be part of this meaningful conversation!
Definitely could tie into addiction and gambling. The plot of the episode (the nosedive) could have been avoided if she didn't try to "increase her winnings". If she knew when to cut herself off, to quit while she was ahead, she would have been fine. Didn't see the connection until now :)
"We noticed that you're only doing the first 4 out of 5 bullets of your positions responsibilities. You're forgetting "Other Duties As Assigned" \n\nSomeone puked onto the fabric welcome mat. Here's some paper towels. "
At that point you had nothing to gain. Confront her about it? Fight her or the guy? Break up with her right there?\n\nAll you could realize is that it will never work out between you two, and the sooner she's (or you're) gone, the better. Avoided a lot of unnecessary drama by doing what you had to do. 
My manager told me of a story once of a man who came in to purchase something. My manager told him the total, and the customer proceeded to pay by taking a half eaten banana out of his pocket and putting it on the counter, and then just staring at him as if everything is perfectly normal and was waiting for change. \n\nMy manager put on his best poker face as he began to understand that he was dealing with advanced insanity, however he also knew that he needed payment so he told the customer that he needs a different type of payment. He tried to gesture that he paid with banana but my manager didn't want banana. Thinking of the crazy meeting the stubbornness of my manager still is hilarious. \n\nHe later pointed him out to us when he came back in and I would always purposefully walk to the other side of the store to avoid him. Unstable and unpredictable people are terrifying to me. 
My double damage is up and my upvotes have come through! Thanks everyone! I'm 4.5 now! Life is great! I can already feel the real me coming out! I found somewhere I finally belong :D\n\n★★★★★, to you, kind stranger!

This story is nuts haha. Maybe he was framed though. You go around long enough saying crazy things to everyone you meet, you're bound to piss someone off. Probably pissed off his dealer when he told him he doesn't use cash but pays in blood -proceeds to bleed all over dealer-\n\nWhen you see crazy like that, best thing to do is just hear them out and pretend everything's okay while secretly flagging down management/security that we could all die right now. 
The worst part is that I forget every time there are little TVs on the gas pumps and when I leave my car I just hear what sounds like shouting and immediately believe a robbery is taking place. 
Does it allow you to select your device on Zedge, and are you able to download them? It will still work (even if it says ringtone) as long as the file extension is .m4r (standard iOS ringtone/Text tone file)
Honestly, if life's expenses were entirely paid for me, I would get bored and at times I'm sure I and others would want to improve my neighborhoods infrastructure and general upkeep. People would never stop learning and wake up one day and say "I'm gonna learn how to repair downed cable wires this month". \n\nPeople wouldn't be compensated in cash, but notoriety, experience, and influence over that particular area of interest. It's the future I dream of I mean me too thanks.

I'd go as far to say "why does it matter?" We'd hope it would be a window if we were him, however in either scenario, he is still unable to be a part of that world. Only look at it behind glass or screen. Freedom seems closer by and within view, but it's unobtainable and he's only upgraded to a bigger cage.\n\nHe stopped trying to fight against the system and he accepts the life he has. He should take a chair and throw it through the window/screen, and upon the outcome he could use his newfound media outlet to spread small positive/negative realizations about the world to grow in people's minds for change. 
Oh, why thank you! ★★★★★ to you too! Don't spend it all in one place! Hehehehe

If you can, attempt to wean yourself off caffeine, cutting it completely by 2 weeks. You may experience headaches and other withdrawal type symptoms. \n\nI would drink about 4 cups of soda a day before I stopped. Used to have an energy drink once a day before that. I wouldn't be able to sleep until 3AM and I wouldn't get good sleep. I'd wake up feeling like I was dying. I don't have any caffeine that I'm aware of. No coffee, soda, energy drinks, or tea, not even decaf. \n\nNow when I'm tired I lay down and within 10 minutes I'm asleep. I wake up and feel like I can start getting ready for work and for the day and don't want to kill my self instead of getting dressed. \n\nI also use settings like Nightshift or f.lux while on my phone at night to cut out the blue light that makes your brain believe it's a sunny day. All these things definitely helped my sleep patterns. 
The only reason I use a gamepad in my titan is because the default buttons didn't feel intuitive on the keyboard for using abilities. The gamepad I can definitely boost/phase/melee/etc instantly, but when I have to turn around it's painful.

I feel like I just stumbled upon a universal truth and it messed me up. 
In over a decade of retail experience, multiple Black Friday shifts and having worked at more than 6 retail companies, I can say with certainty there is a type of super awful shopper. \n\nThey're easily identifiable, and when you see it, you want to hope your immediate suspicions are wrong. First, because it's not cool to stereotype, and two, because *its about to go down*. It's always a morbidly obese woman, usually travels in packs of 2 - 4. Even though it may be snowing out, they're rocking a tank top that's 2 sizes too small, and short questionably legal bottoms, or if you're lucky, sweatpants that have been worn all week, awake and asleep. \n\nThese people are approaching the register, and before talking to you are already **mad**. They know it's about to go down, that the cashier is going to question these coupons they printed out from Facebook for another store that expired last year. They know their card is going to get declined, because instead of feeding their children appropriate meals they spend all their money on cartons of cigarettes and the most expensive brand new cell phone every 8 months when they switch phone companies because they stopped paying their bill. \n\nThey preemptively strike the cashier while waiting in line, causing anxiety and dread to set in with some casual dropped phrases like "this is ridiculous, I can't wait this long, they need to hurry up". This is in hopes to deter the cashier from checking the coupons carefully and instead rushing them out of the store with their fraudulent purchases. \n\nThey finally get to the register and unload their mountain of garbage. Duplicate items no one needs because they think they'll get them for free with these coupons and sell them on eBay for profit for more cigarettes and iPhone pluses 128gb. They look at you. You look at them. You muster a smile and begin ringing. This is the moment of truth, the silence, only broken by the register beeps. Things are going according to plan. Until you notice the breast sweat smeared coupon is for a different store for last years holiday. You know you have to confront them. You say regrettably "I'm sorry, I can't accept this coupon". **ITS ABOUT TO GO DOWN** You, the cashier just declared war on their mission. No one is safe. Scorched earth tactics GO! \n\nThey're going to belittle you, intimidate you, try to get you fired, anything at all that will allow them to get their way. You are literally their enemy and you're just fucking standing there with your finger near the "Add this coupon anyway?" Button. That button is not for you to press. Ever. \n\nIf you work in a good environment, they will be asked to leave and no employee will get in trouble. This usually forms a bonding experience between coworkers, like prehistoric tribesmen who just killed a wooly mammoth. \n\nThe symbiotic creature, the large human female with living organic sweatpants has left the building. But she will try this stunt up to 4 more times in neighboring stores tonight. It wasn't your job to defeat them, only to get out of their path of destruction.

Wow! What a comment! Thanks for taking the time! I had originally made this a six word story, the title. I then expanded on it in a comment in that six word story. I then deleted it after it was downvoted to 0. To fit one paragraph standards, I had to cut out about half of the rest of the story. \n\nEssentially, the young girl is aboard a long range vessel to the new world.  The humans on Earth waited until they began feeling the effects of their waste to attempt to clean it up. It was far too late. The journey will take 140 years, however her cryopod malfunctioned and opened after 14 years, and there's no way to go back in alone. She will never arrive to the new planet, for she will die of old age before then. The SNT-As were used as sort of polling device in communities, determining what people wanted/needed, and were also used as ways to tell stories and history. \n\nShe may have very well been born on that ship and never witnessed Earth, or at least never knew of an Earth that was green and blue instead of brown and barren. After weeks of attempting to cryosleep herself, she began to understand that she is destined to die alone on the ship. She spends her time learning about the old world from the SNT-A unit. Until one night, it asks her as it would in previous communities what it is she wishes for Christmas. In the past, the highest polled answers were: water, food, and medicine. \n\nThe girl tells SNT-A that she wishes to die, because after weeks of solitude and failed attempts to deep sleep, she knows that's her only fate. \n\n
Mental illness is a serious issue. 
"Killing yourself to earn an honest living? Trying to keep the family together but your 20k income is solely tearing them apart? Why not try home invasion burglaries? Not only does it put dinner on your plates, it also reduces the value of every richer neighboring town you steal from, effectively increasing your real estate value. Set your own hours, be your own boss. Do what's right for your family. "
I like that idea very much actually! I'll need to familiarize myself with other subreddits for short story writing to expand on the idea. Thank you :)
Wonder what mine is!
If you have an android phone you can get the Zedge app and you should be able to find my tones by looking up "blackmirror" or "black mirror" hopefully. Through the app you can download them and set them in your phone settings. \n\nIf you have an iPhone you'll have to download them to your computer and put them on your phone by syncing it to iTunes. 
This is a great idea! Unfortunately I have to wait until next year to take app development in my studies. I imagine it would be very simple to create a basic soundboard app that plays these sounds after swiping the amount of stars you want to give. \n\n★★★★★ Have a great day!

This thread makes me realize how lucky I was. I grew up in California in the 90s. I was in juvenile hall a few times in 8th-9th grade in Los Angeles County. I'm guessing because we were such a high risk population they have us a super-comprehensive sex ed program that included drug information and real take about STIs. They talked about what behaviors were riskier than others, how HIV could be spread, how it couldn't be. Maybe that's why I'm the first male in my family to many it to my 20s before I became a father.

I liked the way Amsterdam solved it. Two express lanes in the middle with permanent barriers. And they switch direction in the afternoon.

On top of that it goes for 8 km (5 miles) without entrences/exits.
First day, you sure? Already green grass and discolored concrete?
I don't think I'm following you completely here. Probably because I lack the background of the debate in the US.\n\nIsn't the American left "gushing" over the Swedish policies? The economy and politics? Universal healthcare and parental leave etc. I don't see where ethnicity enters the debate? \n\nWhen you say the US is more diverse, what do you mean specifically? That the US has more black people or more immigrants or what? \n\nIn 2016 Sweden actually took in more refugees than the US - and that is in absolute numbers, not per capita. That of course creates very different problems that you may have with a non-immigrant diverse populace.

yes it does. You make it seem like these issues are not handled at all which is wrong. They are handled (since 2010) by the Ministry of Employment.

It is only made secret for very good reasons like national security or ongoing criminal investigations.

> besser-wisser \n\nknow-it-all
> One could beleive that these truths are self-evident.\n\nHow do you govern a society regardless if it is democracy or not, by citing "self-evident natural rights" that everyone is just supposed to know? "An individual has the right to express themselves" - no, without limits? "Defend themselves" - no, that's what the police are for. "Not to be murdered" - Are you including abortion here?\n\nPractical life is not as simple as you like to pretend. If it was we wouldn't need laws at all.\n\nYou debate like you are in /r/philosophy or something. This is politics.
It would be more correct to say Bush created ISIS, since the invasion of Iraq played a big part in creating the vacuum needed for ISIS to flourish.
You guys sit here and admit that a harmless prank would lead to people being shot dead and you still see nothing wrong with it. It's totally normal where you're from. It's freaking insane.\n\nThis is why guns in the hands of normal citizens is always a bad idea. Idiots.
It's not unusual for every person in a house to have their own phone.

That's not necessarily simpler.\n\nEveryone knows how ranking works. This is my first choice X, if he can't win, this is my second choice Y. There is no need to know how the counting works, I just need to know my vote is correctly interpreted.\n\nThe other two however gets complicated. In approval voting for example. I check both my first choice and second choice. But I have no way to show you which one is my first choice. Which could lead people to not "risk it" and just check their first choice. And we're back to square one. The same with score voting. My second choice (lower points) actually risks leading to my first choice losing. That's not simple.
This is actually a bit interesting. "mentally converting the times"\n\nHere it's second nature since 24h times are standard everywhere.

One of the biggest concerns regarding voting reform is citizens won't understand how it works in a more complex system. Which could alienate them more instead of the desired opposite.\n\nRanked choice might not be the most optimal theoretically. But it is pretty simple to follow compared to your other suggestions.

Respect to my American brethren for taking a hit like this for the good of all! 
Is that your view of taxes? We don't think like that over here (a majority at least). My taxes benefit welfare and security for all, not just the poor. If my parents get cancer I know they are taken care of and will not go bankrupt. If I lose my job, it's not the end of the world - I will still eat.\n\nThis is not just about solidarity, the security it brings creates positive effects in the whole of society.
Why do they do that? Seriously, why?
It's not factually correct when you miss the context.

The difference is that in RCV, your second choice is irrelevant until your first choice is out. Which is not the case in the other two races. Which makes them more complicated.

Dude seriously. People are not programmed at birth with a list of "natural rights". There has to be some kind of consensus and documentation to translate your view of "natural rights" to a common agreement that you can build a society on.\n\nI might believe that gays has a natural right to be treated the same as heterosexuals. But everyone obviously does not agree.\n\nYou can't just dismiss democracy as a system and instead refer to some vague thought of "natural rights" as an alternative. Now you're just annoying. \n
I agree it's not the same. I just mean since Sweden has most of the basic welfare covered by the state through taxes you can't really compare the numbers with America where a lot of welfare is totally dependent on people giving money to private organisations. \n\nSince I know the poor/sick/old are taken care of by my taxes, I don't feel the same obligation as an American to give more on top of that. 
I'm one of the people having a higher percentage, and I'm fine with it. I never claimed to speak for anyone but myself.\n\nI never said taxes was charity. I said we don't need charity on the US level since we have government run welfare.\n\nAlso, the majority always vote over the minority, that's how democracy works.
Even here in Sweden MSM is fake news. Luckily we have Trump to set the record straight on attacks we didn't even know happened.

"This person wants to/did molest their underage sister. That action is wrong."\n\n"This person was molested by another, while they were underage, but holds no grudge. This action is fine."\n\nThese are VERY different positions and statements, and you're intellectually dishonest if you conflate the two. Milo's phrasing was poor at best, but to make this the hill you're going to fight on isn't really the best idea. \n\nStandard gaslighting tactics. Switch victim and offender, I know you love to do that when you're intellectually dishonest, but seriously, one is a victim, one is an offender, and we can see that. And we're used to those deceptive practices.

She isn't asking about his Deadpool-like appearance, she's asking about his psychotic murdery-monster spree. Like how a childhood friend may ask someone they knew from school but turned into a criminal in the time they were apart "what happened to you, man?".

> Minus him going out and being a vigilante himself, \n\nWell, there was that one story about him stopping a mugging in his youth...
> but he doesn't seem the type to ever accept help like that.\n\nYou never know. Likely no one has ever suggested it to him in a sincere wanting to help way. (I bet plenty have said it in an accusatory/defamatory way, of course, which may make the task harder). He likely would benefit at least a bit.

Here’s the thing. You said a “eagle is a falcon.”\n\nIs it in the same family? Yes. No one’s arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies Freedom, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls eagles falcons. If you want to be “specific” like you said, then you shouldn’t either. They’re not the same thing.\n\nIf you’re saying “falcon family” you’re referring to the taxonomic grouping of Freedombirdae, which includes things from bald eagles to hawks to peregrines.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a eagle a falcon is because random people “call the big birds falcons?” Let’s get ostrich and vulture in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling an eagle a falcon or a falcon an eagle? It’s not one or the other, that’s not how taxonomy works. They’re both. A eagle is a eagle and a member of the falcon family. But that’s not what you said. You said a eagle is a falcon, which is not true unless you’re okay with calling all members of the falcon family falcons, which means you’d call caracaras, kestrels, and other things falcons, too. Which you said you don’t.\n\nIt’s okay to just admit you’re wrong, you know?\n\n**(Or copypasta meme aside, an eagle is actually not a type of falcon at all. They're Accipitridae, not Falconidae.)**

The South Pole. Antarctica isn't that hard to get to, all things considered, but everyone, no matter the continent you're on, thinks of it as some far-off inaccessible frozen wasteland. The flowers that grow in spring are very nice there.

I'd like something sad and depressing. Something that says "we were both heroes, but with simply different, exclusive ways of saving the world, so we should be sad that one must die so the other's plan may go forward, we're both only doing the right thing."\n\nAr Tonelico 2 nailed that, for all the other flaws the game had. The final boss music was two altos duet-singing about how it would be great to have a nap, dreaming of small birds, but right now they need to pray for the salvation of the world. Takes you right out of the boss fight, and going kind of "...right. Yeah. I guess I do have to kill you, but I mean, even if I lose, we save the world, just not in the ideal way to me..."

Don't be destructive ass-hats who actively destroy their own cities, endorse the actions of terrorists, and obstruct justice whenever possible? \n\nMost people are middle-ground. Then one side goes "Well, jails are racist as a concept, prison should not exist, all black murderers should go free", and the other side goes "no... murderers should be kept somewhere they cannot murder..." And then you wonder how the situation came about that the site espousing punishment for criminals and peaceful prosperity for non-criminals got a bigger turnout than the side espousing criminals go scot-free and non-criminals should be punished for it. \n\n"The average democrat" does not do these things, but when the leaders of the party say things like "that criminal could have been my son, this bomb-hoax craftsman should be honored, criminals shouldn't be punished for their criminal actions but instead welcomed"... It gets rough.\n\nIf someone ran on the docket of "illegal things are illegal, legal things are legal, I'm not the unilateral changer, that is the job of parliament, you should make sure your parliament member represents your community first, and generic 'party ideals' second. And likewise, our aim is America first, and raise the rest of the world with us, for a rising tide raises all ships." they'd steal 50% of the republican vote, easy. Add in a bit about unity and co-operation, and you're gold. \n\nBut instead you get "I pledge to start a war with Russia". "No we can't". "We must divide ourselves, because it is what makes us different that is important and should be highlighted, not what makes us the same".\n\nRemember, Trump didn't win, Hillary lost. Trump got less votes than Mitt Romney did, and Obama trounced Romney. It's just the democrats fielded a candidate who literally said "it's my turn" as a reason why they should be in charge, like it's some royal lineage to pass from political nobility to political nobility. Someone so profoundly unelectable that they got president Trump.\n\nTo beat republicans? Two ways. One, break First Past The Post. Then neither republicans nor democrats will ever be in charge unilaterally again. Always an option, and one they'll never take since it means they'll never be unilaterally in charge either. Two, field a candidate who doesn't abuse the corruption in their own House to unlawfully kick out potential competition, because that potential competition would have beaten the republican candidate. If Bernie lost on a completely fair up-and-up, Hillary likely would have won. But he didn't, so she didn't. His voterbase was inspired by someone who wanted to right wrongs, to punish (corporate) criminals and reward the innocent, to help out America's lowest first and then let its rise support the rise of the rest of America and in turn the world... Fancy that. \n\nTL;DR to beat them, you should have run the Grandfatherly Jewish Socialist, not the Conservative Christian Warhawk. If Republicans wanted a conservative, they're run one of their own. They don't need the liberals to run one. To win, you don't need the Republicans. Republicans are a minority of the country. You need to make the undecideds join you. Don't preach to the extreme far left, they'll never vote republican anyways. Don't preach to the far right, Republicans have cornered that market. Preach and cater to the centrists and middle-ground.

From an ingrained ideology with hundreds of tenants and laws, to a generalistic view of using violence and oppression to achieve political goals of authoritarianism. I still say that's debateable, given that the only people using violence to achieve political goals at his talks are the Antifa idiots against him that only add figurative fuel to his fire when they add literal fuel to their literal fires, but maybe you could argue that he's pro authoritarianism and telling people exactly how their businesses should run, who should be allowed to do what and speak what, etc. Maybe. There's evidence to support and go against that. could get a good discussion.\n\nIt's an easier position to defend, certainly, but I'm distracted by these deep ditches in the ground where that goalpost flew by.

Exactly. And that part you should attack, not random labels that are easily disproven, like so many people are doing. \n\n"Everyone I disagree with is Hitler" is not a good argument technique, and you only weaken your position by espousing it. Likewise, calling him a pedo-apologist weakens your position, compared to attacking his actual points on hebephelia and sexual/mental maturity overlaps. \n\nPeople on the side of Truth are having to defend Milo here because despite the many bad things he is saying, people here are lying. Straight-up. Constantly. Milo isn't a good person. Even in his own view, he is a troll. Lying about things doesn't make you a better person than him, being honest does, because he doesn't exactly set the bar at a high level. When you need to resort to falsehoods and lies, your position is automatically assumed to be invalid, because you lied, even if the core of your argument has merit. I call this the "Russian Trump" approach, after the number of people who say "Russians hacked the election", when they mean "russians likely got the emails of the DNC-side non-national simply internal elections discussions and then let the public read them". Which is still interfering with politics, but is a very different debate, since people can agree with your strawman, but disagree with the actual situation (or vice-versa). \n\nMilo is espousing a very old gay community view. If you're against "gay culture", it's easy to be against his view. Most conservatives would be against it by virtue of that, and is why one of his book deals was shut down. If you're pro-LGBT, it's harder since it IS a very established view in earlier (some may say outdated, but still occurring occasionally nonetheless) alt-sex lifestyles, but still entirely possible to be pro-LGBT-reform and general gentrification of the LGBT lifestyle, and thus also against his views. Lots of people from lots of perspectives can be against his views for lots of very different reasons. \n\nBut stop lying. Stop strawmanning. It helps no one.

They would have, if they lived together, Black-Red and Black-Blue, the true colors that cannot be seen by the Other, and Red-Blue, so some things described as "Blue" by one race look red, some look black, and vice-versa.

That's all one should do. \n\nAnd call out hypocrisy and poor logic wherever it is, agreeing with your point or against it, of course.

And that's proper. Speak properly and do not redefine or lie for your points, and your points will come through ever more clearly. So far, so good. He is advocating for statutory rape, to be the most correct in defining his points, which is frankly a very bad thing to be advocating for and I can't help but think it might be related to his own childhood traumas and could use a trip to a psychologist couch, but that's personal opinion. \n\nEDIT: And here I thought T_D liked to prize itself as not the redefiners that "the liberals" (cue ominous music) do. That they were the ones without the Fake News. Just be honest, be accurate, and your argument will be all the more powerful for lack of easy points for people to tear apart. 
You know, I keep saying these things, and people keep ignoring him. Good on you saying them too. But just upthread is a ton of people well upvoted calling him a nazi.

Is a nazi. Right. Tons of upvotes because gotta wank that justice boner, everyone against you is one camp, not a wide variety of views and opinions, just "Evil". \n\nHis positions are precarious enough and debateable enough on their own, the ad hominem just weakens their arguments and allows people to throw out the entire argument because of it.

> yes you can't deny that white people are usually given lenient sentencing in courts and are heavily favored in schools.\n\nIt's an interesting argument. Women, for example, are six times as privileged compared to men, as whites are to blacks, when it comes to lenient sentencing in courts. But we don't parade around with angry hashtags espousing gendercide #AllGenitalsMatter about it, we address it as a case-by-case basis and try to simply point it out when it happens, and applaud when it doesn't happen and instead they were treated fairly. \n\nAs for schools, whites are only privileged compared to asians. Look up SAT normalizing scores based on race. If you were an asian man and competing with a black man (possible depending on what "brown" you are, in fact! India is in Asia, after all.), you're looking at [Source](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html) the black man getting, for filling in the race box as "black" 230 bonus marks, and the asian man getting, for filling in the race box as "asian", a penalty of 50 points. You need 280 MORE MARKS than a black man, as an asian man, to get THE SAME SCORE in the SATs. \n\nThe pre-2016 SAT was out of 2400. This means that just for being black, you got an entire grade average bonus marks. An "average" score in the SATs was 1500. An elite "excellent" score was 1800. That means an "average" black man will get the same mark as an elite "excellent" asian (or white, 0 point adjustment) man, for no reason except his race. Dumber black men get higher marks than smarter white and asian men, because they looked at their skin tone, and went "we should give the black guy bonus marks". That is not a symbol of whites being favored in schools, it's a symbol of blacks being favored in schools. And it isn't condusive to any anti-racism arguments, because it then casts shade on all legitimately successful black people, with a "well, must be nice to get an "A" when others would get a "B" just because of race", which is divisive. But it is the system currently in use.\n\nSo that one is demonstrably false. Scholarships exist for all races but whites, and university entrance exams are slanted heavily towards non-whites and non-asians, granting them insane bonuses on their tests merely by virtue of skin tone. \n\nBut the crime one is true. White people are marginally favored, independent of other variables, even if it hardly is the most important variable.

Statistics is rough. 6% of the USA is middle-eastern by ethnicity, 63 someodd percent is "white" (depending on if you don't count hispanics as white). So you'd need ten attacks by white people for every 1 by middle-eastern people to make the statistics equal. \n\nLuckily, very luckily, terror attacks of any kind are vanishingly rare. But along with that, you see a very different ratio than 1:10 put forward in popular media. And people may not think logically, but they do realize "very few people, lots of reports" is more of an issue than "lots of people, lots of reports". 
So if it was redefined in 2005, the 2006-2016 data should be mostly unaffected by it, then?

It *is* identity politics. In the most proper and true sense of the term. \n\nPeople accuse him of one identity, and his other identities conflict with it.

He is thus, logically speaking, not a nazi. \n\nYour logic is "I don't like nazis. I don't like Milo. Therefore, Milo must be a nazi. Also broccoli and spinach. They're also nazis since I don't like them either." It's bad logic. Straight-up. Or gay-up, as it may be. \n\nWe need to discuss what he says and why they're wrong, not label and then dismiss because of labels.\n\nSorry if that makes you sad because you can't argue logically, but arguing against Milo logically is easy-mode, since a lot of his stuff is devoid of it, so it will be a good tutorial for you.

You're not one by virtue of not using violence to accomplish your political goals and you feel emotions? Too bad, the label stands!\n\nYou cannot call a gay jewish black-lover a neo-nazi and claim the moral high ground. He can be a bad person, he can be against your politics, he can be anti- or pro-pedophelia, he can break the report on several pedos and get them arrested (I know some on the left are very pro it, after all, might explain their hate of him), he can be a victim of child sexual abuse himself, you might hate him because he's gay, or because he's pro-interracial relationships, or has a weird sexual attraction to Trump, or whatever... But you can't hate him because he's a neo-nazi. \n\nYou win no one to your side by calling names that blatently aren't true, and when you go "He's a nazi! Get 'im boyz!" and the people look up this guy online and the first video that comes up on youtube is a speech where he is introduced as the world's most fabulous supervillain and then entered the scene in a costume, carried by eight men, giving queen-waves as he is carried by... \n\nAll you're going to do is discredit your own position. "This person is clearly not a nazi, as they're the most flamingly gay person I've ever seen. If smc23 is lying about that, what else might they be lying about? I should probably ignore their positions, since they've established a history of outright lies to get their point." \n\nAnd then no one wins. Except, you know, the guy giggling like a schoolgirl being carried around by eight men with a big book deal.

I have studied police labor issues and what bothers me about this headline is a very typical conflation of management and labor.  The quotes are from the chief of police, not union patrolmen.  That is to be expected from reuters, and I guess is especially understandable given the reputation of patrolmen.  Ultimately the goal should be to identify and grow cracks between management and labor rather than reinforce the counterproductive notion that they are one and the same.\n\nIn the search for heretofore unknown potentials, no stone can be left un-turned, and all conditions are changing.  The question is not "are cops allies?"  The question is "where are the cracks in the enemy and how can we exploit them rather than patch them up?"
Another perfectly good cinder block wall ruined!
> we have to get people that are conservative socially and possibly environmentally, but can conform to whatever economic progressivism looks like as it relates to farming communities while teaching the "Christians" what Rush Limbaugh isn't telling them about Jesus.\n\nVery well put.  This is not the time to insist on social issues in places like that.  The fact is social issues will be better served by consolidating more support behind a truly progressive agenda.  We have a serious vulnerability in the privilege populism Trump dabbled in.  I fear it is an irresistible and potent cocktail threatening to take over *until death* those people the democrats abandoned decades ago.  I also think we lucked out with Trump because the conditions that made him possible would have allowed for much worse.  He will fumble, and if democrats have succeeded in publicly purging their party, there may still be a chance to turn this around.  If the same establishment corpses are still laying in their way come, say, this time next year,  it's time to abandon ship.

Anyway, the algos are more complicated than "looks at asian stuff, serve them asian ads".  They sometimes make inferences that are right some percentage of the time but not all of the time.
> But contract authority can't supercede a legislature's prerogative to make law.\n\nInteresting.  I'm not sure I'd say it doesn't, but that prerogative is already subordinated to a whole host of illegitimate imperatives.\n\nMore to the point, imagine a very lengthy and specific set of rules for party members that explicitly forbids members supporting, say, TPP or privatization of infrastructure.  You vote in favor of either and you're out.\n\nWould you say all democrats are already going to automatically vote against privatization of infrastructure?  Or against TPP?

Time to stop talking about trump and start talking about the party that put him where he is.  Trump is like a disaster that was avoidable, but now it's not avoidable.  The next Trump may be unavoidable, but this one isn't.
Fuck people who are the arrogant.  \n\nHow about they just not do anything then? 
oh god im glad you said it. 
>And you may have a "fuck you, I've got mine" attitude about that, but it filters down to every bit of life in a city.\n\nThe types of development remote investors prefer necessarily differ from that which a community would prefer.  Nonetheless, remote investors have the juice to get their way.  A sort of "fuck you, I've got mine" if you will.\n\nI do not want the currently high levels of corruption, greed and bad planning to be permanently encoded to the built environment of my community.  Its fruits are objectively ugly, inefficient and worst of all, they take up space where better development could have gone.  But before we even get to that discussion, there is the basic discussion of how a community decides how it will develop.  At present, some communities have great control over their own development, and some do not.  Now the latter variety may be great for investors, but the former are always better for the people who lay their head there to sleep.  That includes people who don't live there yet.  The needs of capital are always justly subordinated to the needs of the community (ie. *current* residents), but this concept really protects communities for new arrivals as well.\n\n> People will move to LA no matter what, so housing demand isn't just going to go away.\n\nIf communities have appropriate control over how they develop, it will be better for everyone, even new arrivals.  I would rather there be a greater number of working communities than fewer communities populating past what current residents prefer.  For example; every investor would like to build a residential tower in Hollywood or Silver Lake because that is where they get the highest roi.  What is stopping the same investors from building in Vernon?  Cudahy?  Commerce?  Compton?  They would have to work harder, building lower cost housing,  and more of it in order to net the same benefits.  I say that's good.  The more we can incentivize the geographic democratization of development, the better.  What better way to do that than to resist development in the places where there is already enough (as determined by the residents of the communities themselves)?
I just wonder what kind of mind sees local control, subsidiarity and democracy as nothing but bigotry.  How did you arrive at this mindset?
If there are three parties, you can count them in any order you want.

>That is a lie from Measure S backers.\n\nYou yourself acknowledged it will cause a moratorium.  That is precisely how it opens up the space for ameliorating the current overbalance of developer and investor preferences to the exclusion of residents.  You may disagree that it will be efficacious,  but that does not make it a lie.   \n\n> The City is already reworking the General Plan per the new State Guidelines, along with each of the 35 neighborhood Community Plans. \n\nI'm sure they are...with a little help from their friends.  The more time we have to build some local awareness and control into the process, the better position we will be to put together a plan that will be satisfactory to residents.  You have to remember that unlike developer and investor lobbyists, residents have day jobs and it takes us longer to get our heads around the process and organize.  Meanwhile, investors are looking at this as a gold rush, and they want to pounce before the community plans are changed, possibly in ways that justly privilege resident preferences.\n\n>Measure S's moratorium is only delaying the inevitable. \n\nWith all of the corruption that has been uncovered in the development process of the city, I think it's a good time to tap the brakes and build some order and local control into the process before we permanently encode the current corruption, lack of transparency and disorder into the built environment.\n\nRemember that when you say "the city has been re-writing the zoning code", you are not talking about residents.  That needs to change.

AAAANd we were both downvoted for merely saying *this is one of the ways*....  my God.
Yep and it won't be neccesary to extend olive branches when they're all ashamed to admit they voted for him in two years.
I do this all of the time.  Don't fall into the "we are capitalist, but we need to change" thing. Instead focus on how what passes for markets actually require infinite nanny state guarantees and subsidies in order to function.   We are not capitalist.  That is ridiculous.  Concentrated wealth runs governments and makes sure their access to nanny state handouts will always be there to protect them from market discipline, unlike the rest of us.  Free markets are for us, not them.  They need to be protected from markets.  In this way, concentrated wealth reinforces itself, and becomes more concentrated.  The goal, which any real conservative should share, would be to eliminate these wealth concentrations (which are one and the same as power concentration).   \n\nJust google "chomsky free markets" or "chomsky capitalism" and you'll get everything you need.  But, crucially, don't link to Chomsky.  Synthesize what he's saying and use it.  Works better that way.
>They thought neoliberal economic policy was politically expedient and it isn't - not over the long term, not over the short term\n\nOf course the tendencies you listed were politically expedient in the short term.  Why else would single-minded seekers of reelection exhibit them?  Even if they were wrong, what they think matters since it guides them.  Prioritizing winning the next election overall is a bias whether it actually works or not.  Just calling it as I see it.
yes!
>They're just going to drop a giant water balloon on your head, let you soap up then drop another one.\n\nbut the advertising will be of someone taking a lavish, old-school, shower, kind of like how dairy products all have idyllic farm imagery from last century all over them.
Yeah they should say let's make the dems a "third" party.
Good catch.  I came here to post a similar thing\n\nFrom the site:\n\n>The big problem with the measure is that it includes a building ban. And while the ban is supposed to last (only) two years and exempt affordable housing, the (unintended?) consequences of the way its written actually prohibits the building of 19,000 affordable housing units already in the works.\n\nfor that figure, the site cites this article:  http://www.betterinstitutions.com/blog/2017/2/14/1300-affordable-homes-wont-be-built-if-measure-s-passes\n\nBut that article says only 1300 affordable homes will not be built.  Do people realize just how little affordable housing is built *before* measure S?  I think most people would be surprised to learn that despite rosy predictions of thousands of new units, the density bonus program (where you get to build denser if you include affordable units) led to exactly [327 affordable units in 6 years](http://www.lacontroller.org/density_bonus_audit).  Either way, there's no guarantee even that many will be built.  Finally, the idea that affordable housing cannot be built without general plan amendments is bunk. There is existing zoning in LA for an additional 1,000,000 units that would not require a zone change of any kind, and that's *before* the general plan and community plan updates.\n\n
That trussed entrance structure looks like an addition to me.
Never read this!  Thanks!
To everyone saying that it is clouds.  The angles seem to be all wrong for that, no?
Real libertarians like Noam Chomsky or myself are not far off from real republicans like Frederick Douglas.
No dems will split off votes from better parties
Is it less development driven than this subreddit?
As someone who has lived in New York and Los Angeles I think the window space people want at home is to some extent determined by the amount of light they are blasted with during the day.  I have seen New Yorkers arrive in LA demanding that their first apartment have amazing natural light.  Afterall, in NY, you really do need that.  They turn down really good places that don't have ridiculous amounts of natural light.  After a year or so of getting the sun in the face all the way to work, most of the day, and on their way home, they start to understand why people here are less adamant about it.  I've seen New Yorkers get sick to deah of light after 6 months in LA.
Of course there is.  Poooooor folk are having their circadian rhythms messed up!!  A whiny SJW like you should be all over this.
From the measure S website:\n\n>Measure S will force the Council to create an updated plan for balanced growth, instead of allowing developers to dominate the planning process.\n\nI think this alone can account for the histrionics we are seeing about this milquetoast measure.  International money has its sights set on Los Angeles, and the last thing they want, as they pay off our corrupt officials, is the residents of the communities having control over how their neighborhoods develop.\n\nThe criticism that it will hurt jobs bothers me most.  The development preferences of my community should not be determined by the fact that builders would like to stay busy by building in my neighborhood rather than some other one.  Investors will build elsewhere, in places where it is needed and wanted by the current residents and that is a good thing.  What's more, to net the same return, they will have to build more if they have to build in lower rent areas than if they build one luxury tower in Hollywood, say.  I'd rather have *more* good communities develop for people to move to rather than gridlocking and over-crowding the ones that have been dubbed "hot".  The geographic democratization of development begins with incentivizing investors not to invest where current residents do not want it.\n\n\n
We probably totally disagree, but your site is thoughtfully designed, and I don't feel like I am being manipulated when I read it.\n\nI think you can do better on the sourcing: like rather than link to a blog, you can link directly to city records it claims to cite.  I have a pet peave with it being called a building ban (it's a specific zone change ban), but I will not take issue here.\n\nAs someone who agrees with the guts of the bill, I asked the people who drafted it why they included the moratorium when it was so politically difficult.  They said it was necessary to prevent the measure from having the opposite effect from what they intended.  If investors knew a rule change was coming that stops them from buying R-1 and rezoning it as high rise, there would be a rush of investment from all over the world to get in before the rule changes.
Are we sure we know what we mean when we say libertarian?  Because Chomsky once described his views as being well within the libertarian tradition.
There is no middle
>I don't agree with anything you said, but I will at least give you credit for copping to your overt nimbyism.\n\nIf you want to brand community control that way, realize that it also applies to you in your community if there is *anything* development wise that you would prefer there over something else.
Oh so now minors have to be dwarves???? #abelist\n\nIm looking really stupid for no reason at all...except the obvious.  Goodnight
The foreground building is more of a dark hero compound.  The white monstrosity behind it is what I call stucco and weep screed modern.  It's like the common foot soldier of evil architecture... The guys who are bantering over cigarettes as the hero sneaks behind them, gripping their heads, and ramming them, each against the other, knocking them out cold.
I am interested I will check that out thanks! 
>The neighborhoods design is the reason for gridlock\n\nMore like lack of design.  Remote capital predominated over the preferences of residents for too long, and it shows, as you've pointed out when you said "their time has passed".  And why do you suppose that is?  Clearly you don't  think the neighborhoods design reflects the preferences of the much maligned residents (ie. people who live there)?\n\nIn most major American cities, the City Council is required to update its General Plan for development every five years to adapt for change. But L.A.’s Council has abandoned this duty and our plan is now 20 years old.  We should force the Council to create an updated plan for balanced growth, instead of allowing developers to dominate the planning process.
No, I mean a dedicated diaper service.  I used that example because it was one of the first zoning issues tackled in LA's original zoning code.\n\nIf you want to have no say in how your community develops, and you would prefer for a remote owner to be able to open a noisy 'oontz oontz' club or bar next to your house, that's your problem.  Most residents privilege the prefrences of the whole community's shared goals over any single party's preferences, much less a remote owner who does not live anywhere near the community.
I did not say you're a shill account.  Only that this is one of the ways they gain cred according to that video about it that made it to the front page a few weeks back.
;) calm down
I have an annoying posting limit so I finally I went to bed.  The linked report makes the case that there is not enough jobs in the valley.  I agree.
The steel and glass thing is so victorian.  Why does everyone love that old-timey crap?
If $100 bill is defined as, say, a New Dealer who ruthlessly votes with their constituents on social issues and even climate change, then maybe we can have $100 in every seat.
The republicans are a third party.  So are the dems.
>Eh, it's not wrong.\n\nIt's never ever wrong.  The algorithms know all.  No one shares computers, or blocks cookies, or what have you...  If the algorithms were ever wrong, google/facebook would not be profitable.
STAHP\n\nguess that's the band name, now.
too often.  When there is a plan for my community I don't want to have to keep going to meetings to defend it from people whos job it is change it.  The reason why is because I have a job, and it is not to be at those meetings.
> Makes me think of the cops that quit at standing rock. \n\nYes!  Or the ones that joined the occupation In Madison.  Or the ones that said bullying ows was hurting morale.  The papers never reported it when the cop unions spoke out against stop and frisk, and of course, who would believe it?  We are conditioned to believe the irrational idea that they *like* having new tasks handed down from city management that expose them to legal and personal risk.   I developed this in a paper once, but basically, I believe the police unions over learned the lesson of  Boston 1919.  As workers, they still want and deserve their right to withhold labor.  Anachronistic laws make striking illegal ever since 1919, but they still engage in wildcat strikes.  Right now the enmity between cops and everyone else is so hot, no one can imagine a scenario where suddenly they're joined to a larger labor movement which strikes in solidarity, a complete and utter disaster for concentrated power.  The barriers to this are real but impermanent, I claim.\n\nThere are some strategic as well as tactical implications to all of this.  For example, we all assume cops would prefer nothing to the basic arrangement whereby city managers (who are beholden to concentrated wealth) dictate specific policies regarding how patrolmen will spend their time.  But If patrolmen were self-managed, there is no way in hell they would be doing a lick of extra work--especially If it made them the bad guy.  They would be working out and cooking at the station or strolling the streets, waiting for a real problem where they can come in and be the hero everyone loves; more like firemen.\n\nFinally, as we got a taste of in the recession, cash strapped cities are straining management-labor problem here even more.  We are starting to see police unions being broken.  The national police labor associations were completely unprepared for that and had no response.  Soon automation will tend to threaten their jobs as well, which will further disrupt the current orientation and create new potentials.  Well I must end it there for now.  "Food for thought" as they say zz
I get your point in this particular case, and I would be interested to see exactly what issues they vote nice on.  But in general I'd rather have one $100 bill than a thousand pennies.\n\nIf a member votes with you 90% of the time, but the other 10% is on things as important as climate change, maybe it's not worth it.  It's like when they were trying to get Sanders supporters behind Clinton because they voted the same way so often.
> I can sympathize with concerns about putting a pollution spewing factory next to a school or homes, but that's far different from trying to monopolize street parking for yourself by keeping newcomers out.\n\nThe idea that the prefrences of people who do not yet live in a community should be privileged above those of current residents is a completely novel one as far as I can tell.
>If the tax rate was really 90%, the revenue would be a HUGE chunk of GDP\n\nWasn't that just an upper marginal rate and wasn't the tax base minuscule?  And You're saying revenue today is roughly equivalent to what it was then, but I don't think the goal is defined in terms of  revenue and GDP.   The goal is efficient resource allocation, which objectively has decreased...eh improbably off topic.  I'm tired.  Goodnight.
I don't know.  How is anything binding?
>Somewhere along the way the right found Jesus, to fool the poor folk, and the left abandoned white men, to get every other vote. Maybe that's an oversimplification but it rings true at the 10000ft level. \n\nThey abandoned workers, most of whom were white.  They did it because it improved their access to big money.  Maybe that's the 9,999ft level.
Where do you live? Have you talked to your neighbors?  Have you asked them what they think about a shiny new luxury tower going up next door just because foreign investors greased the right palms?\n\nEvery resident that gets hip to what's going down wants a moratorium.\n\nEdit: this comment double posted so I erased it
>If you check tax revenue relative to GDP\n\nI don't see what such a general measure could tell us about that could tell us about a particular tax bracket that was one of many sources of revenue.  Government spending has increased as a rule, it's just increasingly oriented toward overall inefficIent resource allocation.\n\nAnd I'm genuinely asking you this (ie. not challenging you) what do local taxes have to do with it.  You had been addressing national taxes, no?
There is more land LA adjacent than there is LA land.
> It really shouldn't be anyone's business what someone else does with their property and their money.\n\nOk.  Diaper cleaning factory next to you.
>The zoning code and General Plan are only guidelines, they cannot and will not be able to inform every nuance of every property and every possible building proposal or use.\n\nWhich is why it's only a 2 year moratorium.  I think that is reasonable given the corruption being discovered.  Spot zoning automatically favors those who can afford to hire people to get the entitlements they require.\n\nHonestly, I would have no problem with spot zoning if the residents had final approval.  That could be a good way to make exceptions during the moratorium, and a good general practice thereafter.  No?\n\n>There is no reason to preserve useless industrial zoning where no industrial demand exists\n\nThis strikes me as short sighted, but it's definitely subjective which is why the best thing to do is allow the residents to decide.\n\n>In this case, the City Planning Dept can wisely amend or exempt the General Plan to meet market demand. \n\nAs long as the residents approve of it, I don't see what the problem is.
There are more people in town than normal rt now.  I have no idea why.  Parking is worse in northeast LA than ever right now.
No there's no "deep bench", nor does there need to be.  Do you really think WV is that mono?  It's not.  It is a surprisingly diverse place.  A real political organization would be grooming new leaders at every level as part of overall strategy.  But the democrats are not doing that.\n\n>The party's problems include embracing neoliberal economic policy, obsessing over social issues, focusing on big-dollar fundraising, focusing too much on the presidential cycle, overcentralization and neglect of state parties, organizational chaos and turf wars, an overemphasis on advertising campaigns and paid consultants and an underemphasis on grassroots organizing and get out the vote. The list goes on. But none of these things have anything to do with near term vs long term planning.\n\nRead that back and see if you can guess what I'm going to say.\n\nYou listed areas where the democrats have lacked strategy and focused on that which is political expedient to the exclusion of what would be good for the party in the long run.  These are what I am referring to when I say short term bias.  Insisting on  pet social issues that arouse predictable organized opposition in the electorate to the exclusion of addressing what's addressable and perfectly politically possible at the root level is the kind of behavior we are familiar with.  But do we realize that the democrats have left entire areas of potential to rot on the vine?  Trump picking up on the insecurity over outsourcing is just the beginning of a realignment that will end with the democrats becoming a third party.\n\n>Reforming the party does not have to mean making stupid decisions in the near term with the expectation that they'll pay off in the long term.\n\nReforming the party means finding out what lies at the root of its problems instead of just treating the symptoms.
If you think using state or commercial law to bind party lawmakers to their platforms is stupid, then don't propose it. Now, if voters can evaluate lawmakers on the basis of how those lawmakers' votes effect policy outcomes, so can a party.  Maybe I'm not thinking this through, but *what else* is there is to evaluate a lawmaker on other than the policy outcomes of their votes?\n\n>Power in politics comes from the ability to build a broad consensus, and undermine and divide the consensus of your opponents. What power comes from dividing your own team? That's fucking deleriously stupid.\n\nIf you believe consensus is that important, then you understand parties need ways to discipline members that do not honor that consensus (binding them, if you will).  Of course, they already do this.  I would simply like it to happen in a way that privileges the broader consensuses of the demos over that of donors and concentrated wealth.\n\n> there's some "infrastructure" that the government should sell. It's old, it's purposeless, it might be of value to some company or maybe they'll just cart it off for scrap.  But then I don't see everything in black and white. \n\nSelling off old equipment is privatization of infrastructure?  Splendidly dithered, but I see why you used the scare quotes.  As for TPP, I'm not sure I'd say the best way to stop China from killing off domestic industry is for lawmakers to bind us all to agreements we aren't allowed to read.
One of your other links , recode la, had the following blurb at the bottom of one of the pages:\n\n>Lee D. Einsweiler is a one of the founders of Code Studio, an urban planning consulting firm from Austin, Texas, specializing in zoning, subdivision and form-based code drafting throughout the country. Code Studio is the lead contractor on the Los Angeles code update.\n\nIs this who you mean when you say *the city* is rewriting the zoning code?\n\n>There has been plenty of involvement from the public\n\nThat's a joke.  Most of the public has no idea such decisions are being made right now.  Regardless, I don't see why anyone should have a problem with banning spot zoning until the general plans are amended.
Make platforms explicit and binding?
I laughed in bed.  Wife still sleeping.  Phew.  Good job.
Dems were prog and blue collar most of their history.  They won more too.
I bet their real estate holdings were worth more to the owners than their production.  The factories will become residential buildings.
No I was just too overwhelmed by the fact bombzzzz.
Well hundreds of them are illegal.  We can work to change the rules and make them all illegal.  Have you heard of Dennis Hathaway and Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight?  I've worked with them before.  Good initiative, but they could use help.  Dennis can tell you how to fight local ones.\n\nOf course, an effort to change the rules within the system can be supplemented with a more unconventional route.  A simple paper cup filled with pvc glue and glitter is a good way to irreparably harm a billboard.  They are stretched so tightly, I have wondered if acetone and methyl ethyl ketone would cause the material to split.
You avoided talking about what I feel are the issues.  But yes,  use more allegories.

This is sad because nothing says ghetto neighborhood like when it is lit up like daylight at night.  And meanwhile nice neighborhoods are always super dark.
How is the Skyline Campaign doing?
>S will make it impossible to build transit oriented affordable housing and that alone is ridiculous considering the money we just approved for transit projects.\n\nTransit oriented housing is a meaningless buzzword.  There is no requirement that the people who live in a place near transit (which is really everywhere) will use it.  The whole city should be transit oriented.  I used transit in LA for two years.  I never had to walk very far to get on it no matter where I was going.  It is lazy planning, and as we are finding out, the process is corrupt and until we can build a greater degree of democracy and local control into the planning and development process, and root out the corruption and lack of skill, we should be putting on the brakes.  I don't want to permanently encode the current corrupt mess into the built environment.  Fix the system, and then build.\n\n>Gridlock and over crowding? That's what happens when you make people drive from the valley to get a job and afford rent. \n\nOvercrowing is what happens when people live in the valley instead of denser development elsewhere?  Interesting.  And what do you mean "drive from"?  Where are they driving to?  The Valley is just one more set of dispersed neighborhoods among many.  Commerce is not, and should not be centralized in Los Angeles.  Building housing Downtown, for example, is just as likely to lead to someone commuting the same distance to work as if you build housing in the valley.  Unless you incentivize people to locate near work, or employers to hire locally, people will cast as wide a net possible, and  they will seldom rank proximity over other imperatives.Gridlock is what happens when the traffic impacts of a development are ignored because the developer greases the right palms.  Ever drive through Hollywood on the way to work?  A complete shit show.  I was not surprised at all to learn that it is the product of corruption.  \n\n>Want more local control over building? Empower neighborhood councils and make politics local. There are thousands of better ways to fix this city than measure S. \n\nI think it is clear I want more local control.  It is clear that anyone in any neighborhood has ideas about how they would prefer it develop.  The question is *why don't they and what are we going to do in the meantime while their voice is restored and the corruption cleaned out?*  Until there is more local control, and less corruption, and an updated plan for balanced growth, there absolutely should be a moratorium.
Neither is earth lately
>What about areas like Hollywood. They've grown well beyond a small suburban neighborhood.\n\nWho is talking about small suburban neighborhoods?  Hollywood is, and has been extremely dense for a long time.  Everyone I know in Hollywood, rich and poor, homeowner and renter *every fucking resident* has very strong ideas about how development should happen going forward.  You can probably guess how they all feel about *more* gridlock, *more* crowding, *more* remote ownership, etc etc.
A great deal of California's population use their cars for work.  For example, I work in construction and my wife works in production.  These are both huge industries in southern California.  Commuting with our cars is part of our job.  I can't take a bike with a lumber rack, and my wife doesn't want to tote her mobile office, printer and all, on the bus.\n\nThe way to reduce vehicle miles traveled is to encourage and incentivize a distribution of commerce commensurate with the distribution of housing, and then incentivizing people to locate close to work. Remote location will tend to reduce VMT as well if there are incentives.  As long as we are subsidizing the cost of fossil fuels, people will continue to cast as wide a net as possible for housing and jobs and they'll continue to undervalue proximity.
I'd call this nuke-proof brutalism.  Brutalism is one of those things I like the sound of (an honest style based on a good material), but I don't like many of its fruits.
Until there is more local control, less corruption and an updated plan for balanced growth, LA will continue to devolve into a gridlocked shit show.

Good point. 
Can you quantify   The " MLK was a criminal and blacks are violent!"  comment  with numbers.  \nRacism  as a whole has gone down year over year.  White people as a far majority are not racist to black people. It's been polled to death.  \n\nI think it's important that we as a county (USA)  remember what we feel and what the facts are,  are very different things.  
Not really.  Your thinking that they just copy and paste the same system over.  I doubt for story it would be that simple.  There are probably a number of ways they could implement it.  
ok.... but how did Jack go from bald to long ass pony tail! EXPLAIN THAT!!!!!! \n:) 
Sure we can do all sorts of things  but the problem is focus.  We need to work on big to small.  \n\n\nIf I'm in my home with my son and dog and my house catches on fire,  and I realize my son needs to do his homework,  and my dog needs to eat....  What do we think I'm going to deal with first? Prioritizing the issue is key.  \n\nAlso yes I admit I'm trying to change the subject  because nobody talks about it much. \nDid you see Obama bring it up regularly?  Nope.  \nDo you see any politicians bring it up at all?! Nope.  \nWhat about black lives matter?  What a joke of  a movement to not actively  go to the neighborhoods that are having the most problems and preach about black on black crimes.  \n\nSo yes we are powerful but since we mostly hear about police being racists and all Trump followers being racist it isn't really discussed.  \n\nHow about liberal and Republicans stop saying that blacks are doomed and are a product of there surroundings.  That might be true for some but not   the majority.  \n\nDon't you agree that these issues are almost never talked about?  
Ok. 
People......  Calm down.... Bioware hears you......  I'm sure if they aren't in the main game they'll be in a DLC. Especially if they can make an extra buck off you. 
Agree.  I've only had an issue with importing my custom shep appearance for ME3 right when ME3 came out.  They patched it a day later  but I was to eager to get to through the game and kick some reaper ass......  If only future  me knew the truth.  
Also I don't care if people have shitty relationships,  until they involve kids into it.  
Ok this is going to sound harsh.... \n\n\nPeople who don't think in this day and age that if you have a device that isn't backed up is foolish.  \n\nMost people fall into 2 categories. \n\nThey get ransom ware and learn there lesson from it or they get ransom ware and don't learn from it.  \n\nGet a true back up with versioning (Carbonite or the like) and use it daily.  
It might also be borong to some players as well.  \n\nIf you don't particularly like gunning then yes.  
It will perform as well as consoles or better if you are talking about the Xbox or the PS4, probably not better then the PS4 pro.\n\n\nEdit.  \n\nI should add though that I don't think you should go down the PC road...  I am a PC Master race guy myself but save your money for a pc with 2 times the budget and you'll be much happier.  \n\nBuy a used Xbox or ps4 and be done with it.  
I respectfully disagree with some of the things you are saying.  \n\nCrime rates are high in the African American community due to broken homes,  and mom's not being able to afford there kids.  It's obvious that that is the major reason.  They don't have time to watch there kids cause they are working so hard.  \n\nIt's not the responsibility  of the governments  to tell people how to raise there kids but we now need to do something.  \n\nWhy is it that Jews,  and Asians don't run into these problems in the numbers that blacks do? Jews have historically been oppressed longer then most races and they seem to be doing just fine in America, oh yea Asians have been as well.  They are doing so well that they get deducted points on the SAT (http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html#page=1).  \n\nI never said that preaching is "magic".  I like the idea about better police but why would people sign up for that when the neighborhoods that need the most policing are waiting to shout racist at them if someone who is crazy and happens to be black gets shot? \n\nBetter schools sure sign us up but,  again why is it whites going to the same schools as blacks are doing better.  Maybe the home life is the problem and not  Racism. \n\nI know people talk about black on black crime but nobody is talking about the broken families.  ALL politicians ignore that which is obviously the number 1 reason why the African American communities are suffering how they are.  \n\n\nI don't deny that Racism exists,  I don't  deny we need a better police force,  I don't deny more outreach programs need to exist,  I don't understand your  blanket statement of "more opportunities".  African Americans have plenty of opportunities just like all Americans do but not all Americans can get access to them for multiple reasons.  \n\nObama after 5 years in office finally acknowledged it then got heavy criticism for it.  So he never brought it up again. \nBernie Sanders  ( who I respect)  flat out was asked if "all lives matter,  or black lives matter"  and he replied "black lives matter." and why?  Cause he's pandering.  \n\nThere is some good news.  Finally African American teens see an important value in there education.  Black/Hispanic teen pregnancy  rates have gone down!  This is huge for the future generations.\n\nEdit: mobile keyboard... Sorry for some typos.  
Dick-nipples you are wise.  
I understand and thank you for the apology. \n\nI don't understand what is really that hurtful even after reading our prior threads.   My message is clear: we need to help African Americans and they need to realize that they are on a destructive path.  \n\nNever did I  say they  are on there own,  never said they are doomed.  \n\nI'm pretty hurt that people refuse to see these as issues that cause harm to our country.\n\nEdit.....  Mobile keyboard mistakes.  
Seriously right! \nMy friend was trying to tell me about this guy that supposedly exists.\n\nHe started some rocket company to try and go to Mars.\nAn electric car company that was apparently worth nothing for many years and is now becoming a disruptor in the automobile industry.\n\nApparently he is starting some battery manufacturing warehouse, the largest single story warehouse/manufacturing building in the world. \n\nAnd a partial owner to some solar panel company where.... get this... apparently instead of solar panels... they designed roof shingles to be the panels but from certain angels.... you can't even see the damn panels... they just look like shingles....\n\nI told my friend...ya right.... impossible! \n\n\nObviously I'm just fucking with you and please don't think of me as being an ass I was just trying to be kind of funny, but I think if you look at Elon Musk as a micro-scale version of the what the Illusive Man could do then many years into the future of ME lore where technology from other civilizations/races combine, maybe that would be why he was able to get to where he is.\n\nAt least that's what I tell myself. 
Wow.... You are such a harmful person. \nI am actually glad you showed your true colors and proved my point yet again.  \n\n
Must derail...... \n\nPlease tell me the story behind your username.  
Did you actually find them satisfying,  us this pre or post directors cut. 
It's sad even asking questions to try and see where the other side is coming from results in people down voting.  \n\nIt sucks for America that we can't talk to others  about these issues with out bullshit accusations.  \n\nHowever I thank you for your comment even though I may not agree with it totally.  \n\n
So you're saying that African Americans biggest problem is dealing with racism and not black on black crime,  and or broken families?\nSo your saying as well that a long enough time hasnt gone by so the majority of people are racist towards blacks.  \n\nThis is exactly part of the problem. \n\nI absolutely am not a racist, the majority of Americans are not racist.  That is a fact.  Americans have only gotten more tolerant and  it less tolerant.  Also a fact.  \n\nWhy are you so keen on perpetuating a stereo type again back people.  That is racism.  \nIf you tell a child that he/she is useless and can never amount to anything,  that  child will most likely grow up to amount to very little.  \nIf you do that to an entire population of African Americans what do you think that does.  \n\nI don't know why you quoted "Racism is over"....  I never said that.  In fact  I think Racism is obviously still in existence.  However when it comes to issues with the African American community racism is a small part of it.  \n\nWhy is it when they test white kids at mostly urban schools they have better grades? Same teachers,  same school.  Why?  \n\nIf you are wanting to oppress a group of people by saying everyone is out to get you and hold you down,  what does that do to people? Well obviously is oppresses them.
It certainly makes me think think it should have been part of ME2 to begin with.  
I really liked it.  \n\nI thought it was fun how the mission never took itself seriously. 
I understand this.....  But that doesn't really answer my question.  
You know nothing about me,  my job,  my life.....  You have no idea what you are talking about.\nEdit: \n\nIn addition to that it doesn't take a genius to see if you come from a broken home it usually doesn't turn out well for children. \n\nIf we can't even agree on that I see no reason for this to continue.  You are digging into this argument for what? To say it's not a significant problem?  \n\nThis has never been considered controversial to most civilizations,  certainly not American civilization for years and it's still mostly not.  However if we talk about groups being affected by it then we are just racist? \n\nIt's sad that it's come to this.\n\nEdit 2: people can have a basic understanding of something without experiencing it.  To assume otherwise is asinine.  
Sure.\nI'm trying to talk about issues,  and you want to speak in allegories.  
I'm sorry but I feel you don't understand America at  all.\n\nI'm sure others feel the same towards me.  \n\nThis scenario that you describe is not what happens regularly  it just isn't.  \n\nWhere was the boys father in this story.  \n\nThat was a joke by the way.  ☺️
I wasn't going to ask.  LOL.  \nSo instead of defining good lets define bad.  \n\nBad is the black on black  crime rate being as high as it is. Bad is the single family homes that kids are being raised in.  \n\nYour telling me not to put people in a box but you are willing to ignore all these facts about your community  and what good does that do?\n\nEdit: let me rephrase that last sentence.  \nYour telling me not to put people in a box but you are willing to ignore all these facts about OUR community  and what good does that do?\n\nEdit 2: I'm sure you'd agree that if you raise a kid and tell him or her that they are useless and or beat the crap out of them the odds are that child won't be amount to much in th future? ( God I hope people would agree to that)  then I think if you do a good job raising a child by providing the basics kids need,  shelter,  love,  discipline,  and education they will grow up to be good adults.  
Especially since in ME1 he is looking for reasons to make you feel like a piece of garbage.  
That's fair,  it was wrong to say that.  \n\nI do believe as a culture we are beyond safe spaces.  I thin we are better then that.  
Agreed.  Also......  Get through the Citadel portion of the game.  It's exhausting and tests your patience but the game opens up quite a bit.  I'm sorry though...  The Mako seems fun at first but sucks.  You don't have e to do all the collection of tags and shit since it has no real affect on future games but you can also modify your save file for ME2.  
Perhaps.....  And perhaps as an American who sees broken homes  all the time I might actually be right  as well.  
They should have made it so consumers would only have to check in every 30 days.  
I understand.  \n\nHowever Terminator wasnt a basic movie and T2 surely isn't remembered so fondly because of how basic the movie is.  
I've had plenty of teachers who would argue that homework is always more important than survival.
Or any that are retrofitted, especially if the seats need to be replaced for any reason.
I see you've played caty not a caty before.
By the one that didn't make it, I'm guessing the driver with the biggest balls.
They can still afford lawyers who are good at annoying the judge enough to just get it over with.
Monty Python doesn't have a huge female fan base in the USA.  She likely doesn't know him as anything other than "an actor/comedian who was popular in the 70s".
You've made a lot of assumptions. \n\nI've actually stated facts.  \n\nIt's been polled that the most intolerant people are in the 55+.   That makes sense.  \n\nOverwhelmingly most people have no issues with interracial marriage. \nPolice on the whole arent racist.  They just aren't.  I'm sorry that bothers you.  \n\nSure I agree that profiling happens.  It's actually pretty crucial if your in law enforcement in fact people in the FBI have titles of profilers.  It's pretty important.  \n\nBlack people with criminal records serve more time mostly because they have more repeat offenses... That's the way it works with our judicial system.  \n\nYour comments about centuries of disenfranchised African Americans is ridiculous.  Jews,  Asians,  and the Irish have all been persecuted on,  and in the case of the Jews they have had it bad for longer.  So they aren't doomed.  \n\nYour comment about the white kids at the urban schools succeeding just proves my point.  White kids are doing better in similar situations to black people because they have a better home life.  \nYour calling me naive as an insult which makes no sense  I've stated facts.  \n\nAnd it is a fact that America has gotten more tollaerant as a country.  15 years ago no homosexual could get married.  Recently we've allowed Muslims in the police force to wear turbans. On top of that, again multiple polls from independent pollsters show it.  By the way that's a good thing.  \n\nI have lived in a poor neighborhood and shitty parents to boot.  I don't except you to believe or care though since it doesn't fit your agenda.  \n\nYou've also assumed things such as "letting the black community fend for itself. "  I have never said that and you are wrong for thinking that.  I'm not saying that we shouldn't do anything but the African American community needs to step up and talk about these issues.  If you don't think African Americans are capable of recognizing there down fall in there own community then that speaks volumes about what Racism really is.  \n\nAll people need to understand when these conversations come up it's not from a racist necessarily.  You don't know me and I don't know you,  I assume you aren't a racist and you shouldn't assume I'm a racist either.  I've also stated that I know Racism exists today and it's of course very evil. It shouldn't be tolerated,  but we have to fix the biggest issues first.  The police have problems and should be  called out for every wrongful death. And  we should also discuss the issues that plague the African American community when/while they are happening.  \n\nWhy is that so controversial?
Thank you for responding.  \n\nI do believe a civil conversation is important when talking about these topics.  \n\nI absolutely agree Racism exists and it still happens.  That's wrong and it shouldn't be tolerated.  \n\nI don't believe  (but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)  that white people have privilege due to the color of there skin. If we are talking about laws in particular then blacks and Latinos,  and other cultures have plenty of privilege that I don't think is good but is actually privilege.  \n\nI think  that liberals  ( I say this as someone who is more liberal then conservative)  do more damage to the African American community by saying that they are oppressed all the time and that they are victims. Why even bother then?  \n\nThe reason he might be defensive ( non of us know the man)  could be for a lot of reasons,  here are a few I can think of. \n\n1. He's a racist.  \n2. He's tired of being called a racist.  \n3. He's tired of being thought of as a racist.  \n\nIs his shirt doing him any favors....  Nope.   But I think it's important that people from the other side understand where a lot of  white and black people are coming from.  \n\nAs to your kid analogy I'd say it depends on the issue we're talking about.  \nI believe in starting with big issues and working to small issues.  \n\nWhat is it that the majority of people in the USA believe is the biggest problem facing the African American community?\n\nFrom what I see it isn't police brutality,  and it isn't racism.  It's the culture.  \n\nI know that sounds controversial but please hear me out before you call me a racist.  \n\nBlack on black crime is insanely high, and black on black homicide is an even sadder statistic.  \nBlack children are born into single parent homes at a 68-72%  percent rate.  \n\nCan we not agree that If those 2 issues alone were rectified that the African American community would be in better shape.  \n\nAgain just look at those two points.  Those are actual facts it'd not being racist to tell people facts that they may not want to hear. \n\nShouldn't the black lived matter movement be more preoccupied with matching the streets of there own community and educating the youth about avoiding this sick pattern?  Wouldn't we all agree that would be better for everyone?  \n\nI'm down with getting rid of racist cops,  and wrongful deaths  but the issues that are larger should probably be handled first.
Read prom as porn... 
They've thought of everything! 
I use steam....  This is part of what steam does depending on the game.  I understand that some players don't have fast Internet but a check in isn't a big deal it takes a few kb.  
I can agree with you that the public school system in most county's are broken to dysfunctional at best.  However you asked who is responsible for teaching them all that?  \n\nAll what exactly? The don't have any babies you can't afford part?  Or the don't have a broken home?  In America that is the job the parents not the teacher.  Teachers are there for education our children in English,  science,  math,  etc.  Of course they learn about sex ed and that still fails them. \n\nAs to the television portion,  yes we have something called PBS) public broadcast station)  they show tons of educational shows and I see then all with my two boys.  \nThe problem with your theory though is that when you black kids in a mostly white neighborhood (middle class) stats still shows they come from broken homes.  So again this is cultural.  It need to change, and that I think we  can agree on.  
Lol fair enough. 
I have to agree......\nThe playing of chess pieces were eye roll worthy. 
Yup.  I really wish they would have disabled comments.  If people want to talk about Mass Effect it should be in  a more moderated space.  
Rocksteady confirmed no Joker in Arkham Knight.
Agreed that it looked impressive for the time but I was surprised that it had so many disposable characters and was so predictable.  \n\nAgain I hope the sequels are good and that he has an interesting lore setup but I just kept thinking.....  This is what James Cameron has been up to? \nTerminator,  T2,  True Lies,  The Abyss, Aliens,  hell even the now dated Titanic had strokes of genius.  This movie felt like a tech demo more then a fleshed out movie.  \n\nNow I know people will probably down vote but the truth is I'll see the sequel and hope it expands the story and universe.  
Wouldn't the bigger problem for black people be that they are getting hurt by other black people in there community?  Black on black crime is a bigger issue then police shootings. Don't we agree on that? 
The hair for Sarah seems completely wrong...  Unless I'm remembering things wrong.  
Thought it would be funnier.  
Why? \n\nI've bought games from them for years  for a few bucks. \n\nI have friends who have bought video cards  which comes with a game they don't want and sell it on g2a and they have had a good experience too.  
No they were meant to be installed at anytime.  
I sympathize with some of the things you are saying  and really the issue isn't really discrimination (in most cases,  the landlord who only rents to single mothers is)  but the labeling of "single parents"  being synonymous with "single mother". \n\nGroups are often woman only because of potential sexuality tension.  You don't want the meeting of single parents at a support group when emotions are high and stress runs deep.  Some allow both sole don't it should be changed or advertised as such.  A lot of drug and alcohol support groups are this way as well.   The fact that you found a support group is great but I don't see the problem anymore since you found the help you are looking for.  \n\nFor you to say that these issues make being a single father harder then single mothers,  grandparents,  God parent,  or whomever else is just an opinion and not a fact.  Raising a child is just freaking exhausting.....  Simple as that.  Your situation is tough and I'm extremely happy that you recognize  you need to have support I think you did the right things and found it.  \n\nI've heard the argument for years (especially on this sub)  from single father's that society paints men as very "incapable".  Yet I don't really see it in the way that people describe.   Don't get me wrong stereotypes exist.  "oh dad poured waffle butter in the toaster to try and make waffles."  sitcom type crap is seen but in real life men are very paternal and providers of love,  shelter,  and security very differently then woman.  It isn't  impossible for human beings to recognize it and give more maternal instincts to the child but it's not programed in us men by default most of the time. \n\nI think people spend a bit to much time feeling wronged.  
As stated by others.....\n\nI only care if illegal activity is happening,  and porn.  That's about it really.  
I agree that people don't understand what the up vote and down vote is about.  \n\nIt's abused.  \n\nDown voting isn't about "I don't agree with this person even though he Hey are just presenting a different side then me,  I should make sure people don't see this by down voting it." but people on Reddit don't get that.  
The reason the anti political correctness  culture is so open is because there are an equal number of political correctness groups out there being to sensitive to issues that aren't real issues.  \n\nSafe spaces,  colleges having lecturers come in from opposing view points  getting disbanded,  liberals yelling at anyone who doesn't agree with the black lives matter movement and calling them racist because they don't agree with them. \n\n Of course people are going to respond in the opposite reaction in masses.  This shit won't get better at a national level until be from both sides can agree to talk about these issues without throwing out insults to each other.  \n\nGo ahead....  Down vote away.\n\nEdit: mobile keyboard.  
Well put. 
Hahaha I eat your down votes and turn them into poop rainbows!  
I disagree with you.  I liked the fact that ME 2 felt a bit different from ME1 and same with 3 being totally different then 2.  \n\nThe overall story is stop Reapers but the experience you have with all your crew and side missions were absolutely great.  I never felt that the story was out of control and losing steam in any way.  The collectors were a great part of the game and felt like they were a formidable foe and I also felt that it was just as satisfying to take them down as Siren.  \n\nI looked at each game as a part of the story  not 3 individual stories.  
Up voting this.  \n\n\nYou really hit the nail on the head with this one.  \n\nEventually they will have to deal with it.  \n\nAnd  since 600+ years have gone by a lot would have happened in the time.  No matter what peaceful/destructive ending people chose they will need to deal with it.  
*blevels 
Remember beating ME2 and that music made it so fucking bad ass.  Watching Harbinger release control of the collector and it just get annihilated.  It was one of the greatest games I've ever played.  \n\nI love how you can go through,  fully complete the game have all members live and you feel like "Bring it on Reapers! I've got my whole fucking team and we will tear you apart!" \n\nThen they show the army of Reapers and you just feel this impending sense of doom. \n\nSo well done.  \n\nI've read people say that ME2 is rather inconsequential lore wise compared to 1 and 3. That might be factually true, but the feels I get when I beat the collectors and keep my squad alive.....  Priceless.  
It doesn't have to be a end of the world/galaxy plot.  \n\nI never felt that with ME until 3. 
Commentors don't bother me.  \n\nHowever one thing that pissed me off recently was GameSpot.  \n\nThey did a podcast and talked about how it's a bad sign that they haven't seen anything about the game in great detail,  and that its rushed.  \n\n\nI think since they are the "media"  and they have tons of web traffic they expressing a opinion nearly as fact was irresponsible.  They started a bunch of FUD for no good reason.  People have spent 1000s of hours developing this game and to have a bunch of early 20 somethings slander a game that they will review due to them not getting early access to it was fucking childish at best and journalistic hack at worst.  \n\n
Thank you so much for this info!
Yea I'm starting to think that's the best route. \n$125  for express monthly pass.  Not to bad. \n\nWhat time does the express stop running?
I don't believe I proved anything to him on my play through.  ☺️
I've had good results with harbor freight tools, they're cheap as hell, you just can't beat on them like you can with more expensive stuff.  That's the trade off, you can buy a $20 screwdriver and use it as a shitty chisel or you can spend $5 on a screwdriver and another $5 on an actual chisel.
Plot twist: s/he/genderfluid/foxkin did it.
What is this box?  That I'm putting people into.\n\nI want people to have planned children and stay together.....  Is that what you find crazy? Besides that  I don't know why your bringing up alcoholism? I'm probably just missing the point.  \n\nHowever I'm also unsure why you start talking about the suggestion of "genetically predisposed".  I'm not saying that black people are different then me in that they can't be smart enough to be doctors,  or presidents,  or engineers,  etc. I'm saying that black culture is damaged in 2 areas.  \n\n1. Black children being born into homes that are the parents are split up (68-70% depending on the source) .  The majority of cases this is a bad thing for kids.  Maybe not every single one of them but the MAJORITY.  \n2. Black on black crimes are staggeringly high.   This is an epidemic that needs to be discussed and fixed.  In 2015, 6000 blacks killed other blacks. In contrast 258 blacks died by police officers.  \n\nWhen I see people ignore these facts it seems as if they just want to close there eyes and pretend that these aren't larger issues.  \n\nPoints 1 and 2 are facts.  When I state there facts to people it doesn't make me racist.  \n\nBeing racist is when someone is actually saying that one group of people are inferior just because where they came from (origin)  or based on the color of there skin.  \n\nSo again what box am I putting people into that is offensive?  If it's that all people should stop having kids they can't take care of then yes...  I'm putting people into a box.  If it's kids should have two parents to raise them and they need to stick around.....  Guilty I'm putting people into that box. \nIf you're saying that I feel that black people are doomed and they should be on there own then you are making assumptions and or jumping to conclusions.  Which I would find offensive. \n\nAlso the argument of what is good vs bad is kid of ridiculous.  At a basic understanding everyone knows the difference at a "law abiding citizen"  level.  \n\nThe culture in the African American community when it comes to my 2 points above needs to change. \n\nDo you agree with that or not?  
Absolutely....  This shit is ridiculous cause it rains what this game is about...  Not enough to make me want to play it but I expect this from Rockstar not Bioware.  \nBy the way I like a woman's ass as much as the next man but that's what my wife is for.... And when she inevitably turns me down i can goto ****hub.com. 
I'm sorry that facts are weapons to you, and I'm not saying that in a sarcastic way either.  \n\nIt's apparently not in your interest to admit that the single family rate for African Americans is a problem. I guess it's not a problem at all and we should all not care if the rate goes up since it apparently has no adverse reactions to the community.  It does for all other communities but not the black community? I know you can't possibly believe that,  you sound like a intelligent person. \n\n\nI'm not sure why when talking about this you assume that this the only way I view of black people.  This is a comment form where this exact issue is being discussed.  That would be like going to a sub reddit about dogs and telling people that they should get life cause they only talk about dogs.  \n\nI do believe that these are  the biggest problems for African Americans.  I believe in a strong family structure  and education for all children.  \n\nthe reason why your analogy for whites being more likely to be molesters doesn't really apply is because it's not completely accurate.  But even if it's close to accurate the problem is that we should be looking at crimes committed from all races,  types of crimes,  and  population of each group.  \nExample: blacks make up 52% of the prison population but are only 13.2 percent of the US population and white people make up about 77% of the US population and take up about 46% of the prison population.   It's insane that we are even in disagreement about this.  I'm not sure why honestly.  I want to resolve these problems.  \n\nIt feels like your projecting your insecurities of these stats onto me by downplaying them. I UNDERSTAND that there is more to the African American community than these stats.  It's insulting that you think other wise.  However these political/social issues and these thing study be discussed.  \n\nI don't look down on African Americans I want to help make our county thrive for everyone.  But I won't feel bad for wanting to fix these problems and I won't imagine that we're going to change each other's mind on these  issues.  \nMy goal is that people can try and see where the other side is coming from.  I feel like I listen to the other side constantly....  I feel like that she only way to move forward in most hostile situations.  
I'll tell you why I don't want that.... \n\nGenerally feeling the mystery of Saren in ME1 was what kept me going I had to figure out what his motivation was.  \nThen it was revealed that he was indoctrinated by a much bigger force to be rekoned with.  \n\nIt was very compelling. \n\nWhat wasn't compelling was traveling on a bunch of planets with the Mako   and doing the same 4 or 5 collectibles that had no real impact on  the game.  \n\nSo now they removed the possibility of a compelling main antagonist (atleast they are downplaying it)  and now it's an exploration game.   We don't really no what that  means but let's say it's a huge improvement over ME1 (which I'm sure it is)  is that the meat and potatoes of this game?  \n\nIt honestly feels that this game is a test bed to see what works with the new direction of the series and what doesn't.  I'm just hoping that the wait has been worth it.  \n\n\nPlease keep in mind I'm still excited for this damn game and I can't wait to play the day lights out of it.  
Wow....  Ok.  \n\n\nThanks.  \n\nThe thing is Americans have proven over and over again that we fight for social justice.  \nSure every government gets something wrong and in this day and age people are more sensitive and ready to fight for an opinion that isn't necessarily worth screaming so loudly about, which waters down real issues.  \n\nWe obviously won't agree on the issues but I see it daily with the African American community  what has happened.  I see it daily that the media portrays them as incapable unless the government steps in (which the government should help but not fix  this problem alone).  We send a message to the black community that they are incapable of fixing these problems themselves.  It's wrong.  \n\nFamily is where all life starts out and having a strong family even in the face of adversity is important.  The civil rights movement proved that as well.  \n\nIf you want to be taken seriously be serious don't be thug....  Treat people the way you want to be treated,  and be kind to your fellow man.  \n\nWe are all affected by these issues.  Having the means and time to raise children is so important and that's not something that is debatable.  \n\nThe government isnt sponsoring this behavior.  The government doesn't want there work force to be on welfare  and neither do all the people.  \n\nThis isn't controversial but somehow when  we talk about it we say these things aren't big issues.  That's so depressing and know wonder these kids feel lost.  We are,  by in large,  condoning this. 
Can I ask a question........ \n\n\nYears have gone by since Avatar has come out.....  \n\nI remember seeing it and it reminded me (socially)  of the Phantom Menace. \n\nI said that movie wasnt very good, and the world took a huge dump on me......  Now that years have gone by can we agree that the movie wasn't really good?  \n\nI'm not saying it's sequels can't be great but that the original movie isn't good and that James Cameron didn't make a movie that was really that impressive?  
Seriously,  I generally like the fire tv boxes.  They were quick, worked great for Amazon video,  and the UI was pretty decent.....  However I live in Plex and for some reason my content would error randomly when playing.  I would have to fast forward through the error section 30 second and go back 20 to hopefully have it work again.  \n\nSwitched to Roku that problem doesn't exist.  Sure sometimes my files aren't perfect and it glitches but it's mostly the most stable I've experienced besides running off my computer. 
MMA-trained woman goes on a date with a guy who is not an MMA-trained fighter but is a guy.  She wants sex, he doesn't, guess who's getting their ass kicked that night.  Then guess who's getting arrested for it,
You're contradicting your own point.  \n\nAll I did was say that black people have serious culture problems in the USA and provided real stats to back it up.  \n\nI NEVER said they should go it alone to fix the problem. EVER!! \nAmerican government isn't built to have it be there for the people except for law and some regulations. It's not designed to give back to the people but it has been shoe horned in with some policies, and rightfully so in some areas.  \n\nI'm talking about addressing the problems that are the biggest concerns, not abandoning anyone.  It's important that the majority agrees that we start somewhere,  but we are distracted by smaller issues such as racism  (which again exists but isn't the biggest issue)  and not the broken homes of nearly the 70% of all current African American children.  \n\nNothing about what i said is racist,  in fact look up the definition of  racist since people are seeming to forget what it's actual definition is.  \n\nBut yes in America we should and mostly do agree that as free people you are allowed to make what ever choices you want in your life.  It just happens to be young African American girls/woman,  and boys/men are making terrible choices.  Having children to young,  not finishing school,  oh and single parents not being Blessed to raise the children they decided to keep.  That CULTURE need a to stop.  It's not the American way and in the civil rights movement the culture wasn't there in the numbers it is today.  \n\nThe government isn't at fault for that, anymore then my mom was at fault for getting pregnant at 16 and having 3 kids she couldn't afford by the age of 21. \n\nFault can be spread around all day but we need to realize these are the big problems so we can take the appropriate steps to move forward and fix them. \n\n
Very well put.  \n\nOne of the comments I saw was something like.  "why do all the characters look like a bunch of liberals."  \n\nAll the commenters are doing is making it a toxic place.  
90s commercial.  A man dressed in a bear costume on the streets,  dancing and doing random things for attention saying "LOOK AT ME!"  \nI think it was an insurance commercial.  Never been  able to find it.  
Yea but it's been years.  I'm sure it will be better then it was. 
What are you talking about?! Nobody is saying  a woman should stay in an abusive situation.  \n\nWith your logic I should say that you are being racist to assume that black woman are either in no relationship or an abusive relationship.  \n\nAbsolutely you shouldn't judge a single mother.  However we should absolutely judge the rate of single mothers in the African American community.  It's extremely high, and for you to turn away from it just because it makes you uncomfortable is a huge part of the problem. \n\nIt needs to be discussed.  \n\nAgain the problem is the African American community are having children they either can't afford and/or don't stay together at an extremely high rate.  This isn't acceptable and I sure hope that everyone can agree to that.  
Often children grow up to be like there parents. Often time if you ask people who the 2 most influential people are in there lives it'd there parents.\n\nGood parents (mostly)  raise good kids with good decision making skills.  \n\nThat's pretty much common knowledge. \n\nOn top of that all Americans across the board are doing something right because  unwanted pregnancy  rates have dropped.  It'd getting better but what isn't getting much better is the African American culture.  It should be discussed and I'm glad it is. \n\nAlso the government should totally do something about it.  I think creating outreach centers in all these communities could go along way. I know it did for me.
Yes but I'm trying figure out a away to make it the most economical. 
I don't understand....  Are you moving to ablther country and you aren't being involved anything with you including any consoles? 
You said it perfectly.....  And brought a tear to my eye. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/QUfgz
I get that this is the internet and people will complain......  But as long as it's the same or better then ME 1-3 I couldn't care less.  I never noticed it being bad in those games until after I finished ME3 after the second time and even then I never thought it was unbearable.  
If it's a coincidence then it's pretty sloppy.  \n\nThe comics are all canon so I think it's really true.\n\nHowever it might be more interesting story wise that she is the daughter but rejects him.  It would be interesting to see her struggle with her relationship with him.  
Wait....  Non white people can't do this? 
So my opinion is that by the time 3 rolled around there needed to be more specific  dialog action that involved your romance.  \n\nEveryonce in a while  Shepard would go and kiss Liara, but nothing monumental.  I think specifically dialog while in combat would be kind of funny.   Somethingike female shep and Garrus\n\nGarrus: "Scoped and dropped!" \n\nFem Shep :  "after last night's performance you shouldn't be talking about things dropping." \n\nGarrus: " Shepard please....  Not in front of Vega." \n\nIt doesn't have to even be funny but the realism of relationship banter would be appreciated and make you more attached to your characters.
I said I work with African Americans and some our my friends.  Not racist and I don't care to hear about how you think it is.  It was brought up because  you made it sound,  because you make a lot of assumptions as your posts shows,  that I haven't brought these issues up to blacks.  \n\nI can do the same thing to you. " why are you bringing up your ethnicity?  It's a tactic to tell white people that they can't possibly understand where blacks are coming from and to shut people  down."  \nI didn't take it that way because I believe you were trying to give me perspective on what you've seen,  which is valuable to a conversation .   However I brought up that I have black friends that I have talked to about these issues, (which  you assumed  that I hadn't in prior conversations) . In fact when I told you I had, you said that the people who did agree with me were very uncomfortable and probably agreed with me to be nice. As if you are the ambassador for all black peoples opinions.  So you did what you resort  to a lot, which is pick a part any sentence to try and attack me personally, by trying to show that I'm being racist and or insensitive .  \nIt's OK if you feel like I'm being insensitive but it is an opinion.  \n\nAgain you are listening to your own side of the story and you take your opinions as facts.  I talk about the facts.  \n\n\nI'm not saying the only issue with African Americans are the 2 I keep bringing  up.  Its not insensitive to talk about it it's insensitive to ignore it.  And by in large it is ignored in our culture.  \n \n \nDo  you believe in therapy?  It's about getting to the root of the problem.\n\nMost people in the US don't know the facts about it.  \n\n\nSo freel free to respond about me and not the issues.  It's what you appear to be doing now. It's also very obvious you want to get the last word in since at this point  it seems like that is what you are trying to do. \n\nHowever you and I going through the same arguments overs and over again and most of them have become aboit me personally. \n\nYou are trying to show me that the biggest issues for African Americans aren't the 2 I believe in,  and because I say they are and it doesn't fit with your viewpoint you go to criticism on who you think I am for some moral higher ground.  Again it's pretentious and it fits a stereotypes of liberals quite well.  \n\n"you don't agree with me,  I've already made my case but since I'm not getting anywhere let's show him/her that they are insensitive for trying to fix/address an issue." \n\nThis is one reason why things don't get addressed in America.  \n\nI'm done talking with you because as I've stated earlier  you have shown your true colors.  If you don't think your being insensitive as well then I feel that's pretty interesting and can spawn a whole new conversation that part of me would like to start but quite honestly shows to be futile.  \n\nI feel I've met you half way with your viewpoints and you feel that the issues that I take seriously don't need to be addressed because it's mean and insensitive.  \n\n\nThanks for the mostly spirited conversation,  good bye.\n\nMake sure you get a good last word  in.  ☺️
I think it shaped things for the better.  Black students can attend anywhere   college course, lecture,  etc.  We are all created equal.  \n\nI'm not trying to be shameful or wrong but why even respond at all if your going to give me data to back anything up,  again this is the problem. \n\nPeople such as yourself are not actually providing information to help further your points.  Instead you resort to throwing your fake/condescending pity on people like me who want to discuss this.  \n\nWe will never get anywhere on fixing this issue like this.  \n
It's a boot graphic, a lot of distros have that.\n\nAlso just to point out, this is not the terminal, this is the command line, the terminal is the program you run in X to access the command line.
I'm consolidating the responses.  Yes I read your deaf farmer story.  It was quite good and I understand you FEEL I'm the deaf farmer.  \n\nBut I could flip that script and do the same darn thing.  \n\nI'm not saying I have the magic  cure.  \n\nAs an American you don't see people in power talking about the 2 problems I keep talking about you just don't and the reason I'd because politicians want to get reelected and it's a taboo subject.  \n\nAlso I work closely with African Americans....  Some  ( you probably won't believe this)  are my friends. You see what we are talking about here differences of opinions.  Not me being a racist.  No magic  cure its going to take hard work.  \n\nYour apology is not to be believed though.  You did show your true colors.  You don't Agee with someone so they are wrong. \n\nThere is no need for us to keep talking.  I enjoyed it  up until the last few hours where you decided to make a lot of assumptions which coincidentally you accuse me doing the same thing with African Americans  even though I agree with you on most of the issues.  \n\nMaybe you can learn a thing or two yourself.  \n\nDon't forget anything your parents told you,  keep traveling,  enjoy your life,  and try not to hide from the truth no matter how ugly it might be.  
I never said, and nobody is saying anyone should teach themselves.  You are jumping to conclusions that fit your narrative.  \n\nAfrican American communities In the most dangerous areas have had special "privileges" given to them that are what they asked for and have bitten them.  \n\nMore money given to schools that terrible school board have no idea where to invest it (bad money managment)  , calling all cops racist resulted in cops not patrolling neighborhoods as routinely so criminals activities have sky rocketed,  the US education system have apparently come to the conclusion that Asians should be penalized cause they are smart, and African Americans should get bonus points  on there SAT because apparently they are...  What.....  Incapable? \n\nHowever when it comes to what happens in someones home...  Yes I believe it's private including the way one raises there family.  However as a society we believe children should be raised by 2 parents and education should be a high priority.  However African Americans don't follow that by a large majority.  \nSure we can thrown money at a problem but we do that now and it's not working as fast as we want it to.  \n
Congratz on vanquishing demons and bringing in 1 demon to the world.  
Not trolling....  How was he racist?\n\nHes saying that black people can be racist just like white people.  \n\n\nI think it's relevant since   a large portion of black people think about white people is that we have white privilege and/or we are racist. 
Let's get this straight.  \n\nI don't think black lives matter is an appropriate group to represent black America.  We don't have to get into that.  \n\nBlack people do have special privileges in America and some of those privileges haven't worked out for them. All fixable... \nSecond of all I have had this conversation with a lot of black people (as condescending as it sounds) and they mostly agreed with what I've said.  \n\nStronger family values are needed and a better focus on education.  \n\n\nThings get lost in translation of text.  I agree it's a sensitive subject but one thing has been proven through all of this.  Nobody wants to admit that it's a big issue.  \n\nI don't need lessons on how to sound concerned,  again  that is very condenseding on your part.  Thanks for the tip on tone being important.  \n\nAnd again I don't think it's just America failing African Americans.  I think history shows that through adversity usually comes a strong family unit.  Not a weak one....  Again Jews during the holocaust,  hell Jews through all the oppression they have had.  The Irish,  Asians,  etc.  \n\nMore can be done, by ALL.\nThanks for taking your time to debate this but I feel your view on this went from the issue to take it to trying to make me a better person. That's not how debates really work and that's not really how this conversation was supposed to go either since it proves my point that people deflect when talking about this and critique the character of  the person bringing  up  a point that is very alarming.  \n\nThanks for giving me your view points though.  
That's fair.  You're right and I'm sorry.  \n\nJust to reclaify cause I've talked with multiple people about this..... \n\nYou don't feel that these issues in the African American community that I've brought up are 2 of the biggest issues that face the African American community?  Is that correct?\nIf that is so then  what are?
Bingo! 
First let's address your comment about the down votes.  \n\nI don't mind being down voted when talking about the subject of stopping black on black crime and lowering  single mother house holds.   If people don't think that's a real problem for African Americans then please tell me how it's helping them.  \n\nAs opposed to the facts bring pulled out of the blue..... \nI'm truely shocked to hear you say that.  To spread that shit around is hateful.  To ignore these issues is wrong for any class/race in our country.  Do you want these problems to continue?  \n\nAlso since you feel I'm making this up here : https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwiTrO_Zy9PRAhUUSGMKHe9lA14QFghCMAU&usg=AFQjCNEDcs0v8Npz5ubOFIS6gw8ScGvLCQ&sig2=aW9OLveq7_CycB235t-1lA\nThose are actual crime statistics.  \n\nHere is this about single mothers.  \n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/\n\n\nTurn your back on these facts and ignore them I'm sure that is going to help.  Your post  is truely the most disgusting and ignorant post.  \n

Things are very conflicting.  \n\nI understand that doing Reapers 2.0 would be foolish but if there isn't impending doom of some sort then how is the game compelling?

You don't get to criticise Trump the same way they criticised Obama because saying you don't like Trump means you will get your ass kicked by people who claim to support the Constitution.

> The real difference here is that men are expected to take responsibility for their own actions while women get to blame everyone except themselves.\n\nThere's all those arguments you can never win with a woman, and every one of them is the result of her unwillingness to compromise or to admit her own mistakes.  The toilet seat one comes to mind, "I'll just fall right through because I rely entirely on men to put the seat down rather than do it myself".

They don't give a flying fuck about saving children, all they're trying to do is feel like they're doing something good without actually having to put any effort into it.  They'll insist you put your rapist's baby up for adoption, but they won't be adopting any children themselves.\n\nThey do all of this in the name of Jesus.  I'm not sure which Jesus because the one in the book of Matthew seems to be all about love and forgiveness and not shoving photos of aborted fetuses in women's faces during the hardest time in her life.

10+ years ago Adelphia Cable randomly shut off my service a few months into it and told me that the reason was that my house was not wired for cable and I would have to pay them to install it.\n\nOne day I'm watching cable TV, the next day I'm being told there isn't even a cable running from the street to my house.\n\nThey wanted $200 to dig a trench and run a line.  I argued for a while about how their service tech was already there and had used the existing direct-burial cable.  Finally I told them that I'd go out to the street and turn it back on myself and if that's a problem they could send a tech out to fix it.\n\nAfter a world of empty threats about how the FCC will rape me, a tech came out, said "yea you're fine" and the issue was gone, until 6 months later when they did the whole thing again, but I was moving out and didn't care.

They're nice to you at first because they see that hanging out with you benefits them in some way.  They then become used to said benefits and try harder to get more from you and thus end up frustrated and taking that out on you.  Then when you tell them to fuck off, their floor drops out and they suddenly lost everything they were getting from you.\n\nWhat they're getting from you could be a few bucks here and there, a ride somewhere, etc.  They recognize that there is a benefit that you provide them out of generosity, and they try to take full advantage of it.\n\nMy advice is to not be more generous to them than they are to you, and try to recognize early when they just have no interest in helping you in any of the ways you've helped them.  I have some very good friends, but I've also known a lot of people who started out as friends but where it later became obvious that they never had any desire to be my friend.

So many embedded systems still run Windows that it's easy to assume they all do, so a nice reminder is not a bad thing.

Geez, the people in your local community are just full of good advice aren't they?
I'm saying that just because OP didn't go into full detail about their ventilation system or structural members doesn't mean they didn't install any.\n\nI don't doubt them for being experts, I question them on if they're jumping to conclusions.  Every day I have to deal with engineers who can't grasp the concept of something looking better on paper than in reality, even experts are still human.
I love when its Christian fundamentalists condemning Sharia Law then going on to say things like that it should be illegal to not worship Jesus.
The Wendys up the street is hiring and I haven't played Doom in a while, maybe I should go apply and start saving.  By 2040 I should be able to play Doom in a 911 rental.

Clearly it doesn't butter the toast, you have to do that yourself, making this a mostly useless add-on that's not worth mentioning.

Lightning flashes without thunder during a snow storm is often from the weight of the snow ripping power wires off poles.  If you see a downed wire, remember that snow is still water and every bit as conductive.

Idk why I am responding now but I meant shaving down the inside of the 416 upper
No I think that would ruin it. It should only be once in a little while, as a treat. 
I see what u mean. What would be better is if all his ammo is traced and if you don't finish someone you can hunt them down 
I don't want a empty barrel or one sticking out to far
Yes. Just not legally. 
The h8ter revolver that just came from elite force. Is 60 bucks and comes with 4 extra "mags" and only needs 1 C02 for 10 "mags"
actually I dont want to deal with buying a bunch of rails for it, ughghgh I am honestly considering the valken

Wait, who is his supervisor 
I run a SAS Woodland outfit that I based off the SAS in Modern Warfare 
im talking about like inside the same building my gun straight up enters a man and when I shoot it doesnt effect him. and no bullet spray being eratic in CQB is a bad thing. if you full auto in long range of course it will be eratic but if im 5 feet from you, you should drop instantly. not be able to fucking 360 no scope me and kill me after i have had multiple bullets enter your body. 
Actually it's under 3 main gods. Brahman, Shiva, and Vishnu. I could be wrong but as someone who is taken multiple world religions classes and is in one right now I'm like 90% sure. 
It was great talking and playing with you man. COST MASTER RACE 
so will the 285 work with the 10.5 inch barrel or do I need something else? 
I think at first the actor was playing him just like he played his role in prison break. 
I think all modders should be instantly perma banned. No second chances 
just wondering. have a good night!
thanks!
but doesn't a bunch of barrel length get cut off by the hopup and receiver 
I wouldn't mind supply drops if they lowered the price of the games. Maybe make the base game 30 and the season pass 20. Plus when new stuff comes to supply drops season pass holders get 10 free high tier supply drops. Or they keep the same pricing model they have now but season pass holders get all the weapons that come out automatically and supply drops are for cosmetics for them, and a way to get DLC weapons for everyone else. 
I didn't see anyone saying that so I thought it would chime in
No what I'm saying is the bullets do no effect when I get really close because my gun clips through him which is bs 
will it still work perfectly with this silencer and flash hider\nhttp://www.evike.com/products/31590/
WHY SO FUCKING LONG 
This needs to be trending on twitter 
Didn't realize they were toys and not people until I read this comment. 
I changed the barrel to a prommy 
I found this rail but what actual rails would I put on it? http://www.evike.com/products/49821/
416 because gas impingement system and M4
Just call them. Speeds everything up. 
okay this may sound super stupid but do do you think it would be a good rail? I may straight up buy this gun and use it as my backup just for that rail. Would it work on a KWA ERG? Because ill be getting a rail and a new gun while the DD rail is the price of the gun. 
My top unanswered Questions;\n1. What happened to Maul after the Palpatine kicked his ass\n2. Who exactly was Sifo Dyas? Many episodes mentioned him but much is still unknown\n3. What was that force planet with the old man, the son, and the daughter\n4. What happened mother Talzen after Jar Jar and mace defeat her 
No I mean as the green arrow, not as Oliver queen 
Except they earned that real money. The hacks are not earned. You're the asshole. 
I know but its the closest design I can find that will fit a standard m4 upper
see originally I wanted to turn it into a 416 but the ERG cannot really take any other uppers and then I would have the rail height issue unless you know of a 416 style rail that can go on a standard m4 with no rail height issues. 
Mod in single player then. I do. Flash mod, Batman, whatever just keep it out of online 
Have fun being an ass and sucking at GTA
I know it's not in beta yet, I've had it since launch day. But for a 40 dollar game, even early access, basic CQB shouldn't be so buggy. 
In my experience Krytacs are some of the best build quality guns externally but always seem to have internal problems out of the box. I would say the KWA RM4A1 is the best gun out of the box I have even gotten. Has recoil and mag cut off system. 
I think flash is getting better but they are riding too high on the flash point, Wally west, Jesse quick hype train 
Fuck yeah
It's not two flashes fighting. The 2 people on the matt are the stuntmen and the 2 standing are the actual actors who play the Flash and whoever that other character is. My guess Martin Stein. 
Eww multicam. COST OR NOTHING 
Not stubborn, just not accepting of cheating. 
I wish I recording something or at least took a picture. But who cares. COST 
thanks!
I loved how many answers it gave us for things we never knew 
just cause you suck ass at the game that doesn't mean you have an excuse to hack
"Black lives matter"
You stole this from Conan 
I don't like how Squad unrealistic portrays "running and gunning" in CQB. 
Why? 
U could, but if you don't you continue to see him. 
Anyone know why she been gone so long 
It's there. It's a plastic one that's built into the arm. 
not the angled rails the screw on ones
Kill your self. Jk but serisouly wtf 
I was originally thinking the krytac 10.5 inch barrel and the 285mm barrel.
Yes. 
I think they could fix the CQB gun mechanics and copy rainbow six a bit with the ability to pretty much always use your gun
I would say if u get the alpha just run it stock. I made the mistake of changing the spring right away then it began to have a bunch of problems so returning it was a pain in the ass. 
Unlike almost every flash episode this season 
Blowjobs?
You clip through enemies, bullet spray is totally erratic in close range and even when I ads half my shots seem to do nothing. You really notice this when you play on the training map on the CQB Area. 
nah too much work. ill just go with the mk18 rail. thanks agaun for all your help. quick question because your name is similar were you playing R6 earlier today with someone named MIDAS and another person named Gortens? 
Basically 
but not hidden right? like this: https://www.google.com/search?q=mk18&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin5KyBpv3RAhVGJCYKHcqHCOkQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=950#imgrc=6ZA2L63VSAA7aM:

I would love a Dr. fate type scenario where he gives everyone's powers to one person like he did to Batman in the past 
Idk if evike ships to U.K. But if so evike
What difference does this make? We already have MWR
im not going for like 100% mk18 accuracy. Im going with the MK18 rail because it is the highest quality free float rail I can find and I want to make my ERG shorter in length. 
No like won't go in. Same with prommy red. Only thing that works is KWA. Tried olive oil didn't do anything. Both to thick
They scratch if u don't protect them 
Something something DANGA ZOWNE
sell a kidney?
I would hate if all of its content came out at release that would so boring 
You could get the KWA ERG but I have a love hate relationship with that gun. 
Do you know if there is a metal version of the rail of this gun? Its pretty damn similar to the 416: http://www.evike.com/products/65554/
it looks more 416 like to me. thats why i am looking for it.
I rarely dont play US. but it seems in CQB guns do less damage. 
You regressed from green to tan. FOR COST FOR VICTORY 
I have most of the DLC items and all of the different businesses and I have never bought a shark card or taken hacked money. If you have money on hand then your just stupid because it takes 5 seconds to deposit. It's not fun when 12 year olds just download some files and get all the stuff you earned. If someone buys shark cards to get all the stuff I have I don't care because they earned that real money but if you just cheat it in you are just a piece of shit. Learn to play the fucking game. Hell they even buffed biker mission so you make like 60k each time which is basically 60k every 15 minutes. Just STFU about how it's hard to earn shit and either put time into the game or don't complain. If you need any external help in any game I don't care what your reasoning is, if other people can do it then you just suck. That's it. Or make lots of real money and buy shark cards. I don't care just don't be a hacking little SHIT. \nEDIT: I have done entire fucking missions and heists with just the starter pistol so don't give me that bullshit.
I gotta disagree with you about voting for Clinton. Obviously it's just your opinion but why not Bernie? He doesn't want to dismantle the Dem, he just wants to fix it. 
Not a people's party. Just an America party. People's party sounds so communist. People's Democratic Republic of Korea or Peoples republic of china come to mind. 
I just want one where all you hear is the music and it ends with Mick saying: "what you wanted me to do another"
Yeah his badassery seems to have gone down. What I really liked about the Hunt scene from the pilot was he seems to be so far away almost sniping the body guards but then 2 seconds later he rips Hunt out of the car and is on top of it. 
Thanks!

I JUST WANT THE 416 STYLE SO BAD. But i cannot change my upper please anyone send help lol
Out of the box I would say Ares but overtime krytac. Krytacs I have noticed always have problems out of the box while ares just work.

Lol clinton couldn't win the race under those circumstances. The undercurrent of her corruption was way too powerful and obvious to everyone by then. Be it in Wisconsin or on the moon, everyone who already knew she was corrupt had made up their mind.

He should have...it's always a good idea to keep the K.I.S.S approach in mind.
Lul fuck you neckbeard armchair warrior if you think i give a shit about being offensive. The problem here is that youre also useless. I dont give a shit if you approve or not, you just literally said a bunch of worthless crap. And "cretin"?...are you autistic?
Pretty much all tattoos require some sort of stencil, at least if it's going to be professionally done. Going in is the best option, that way the artist can tell you what is needed. If it's really small it is up to them to decide how to go about it, but usually that's just a walk in, which means they'd probably do it on the spot. If an artist gives you an appointment it's for a good reason. Giving things the appropriate amount of planning is always best.
Lul..that owl is better than anything on  your page.
Turned me on...speak for yourself
He's not a nut and he's right.
Being a lazy dumb ass does not mean there's no proof. Look it up your fucking self
I love these videos because they use their own actions against them. More and more ppl are getting annoyed by that sort of shit mentality
We should knock keith out....that fucking snake is slithering himself in....and in place make tulsi the front of the party if we want any chance at all.
I dont like you either. "im no expert....that's a piece of shit". See what you meant to say was... "im no expert, so Im gonna shut the fuck up"
Did the artist at any time suggest that there were too many things at once?
Their point was that you didnt add anything useful and just said a bunch of useless and insulting shit. I dont see how you can miss that.\n\nhere idiot\n\n > You can critique other people's tattoos without saying "it's screams Shit"
Im surprised...(I'm not).
I dont think they understand what mehndi is.
You completely missed the point of what he said.
Only you gullible fucks would believe that this shit actually happened....but then again...you also believe that hillary was pro lgbtq when there are videos of her being clearly against same sex marriages. /r/thathappened ...continue patting yourselves on the back....it's this kind of delusion that alienated the REAL left/liberals. 
I stopped reading after " youll ask for proof" ......no...this is reddit...get whatever reasons you wrote after and shove them up your ass.

Havent we already dismissed keith as an insider? His pro-war in syria and secret meetings with the heads of the party is more than enough to consider him a trap. What about Tulsi?

I'm sure we're not the only one's who hear it and think, wow this is some ridiculous cold war era bullshit. Especially considering they completely avoid mentioning how the hacks proved Bernie was cheated in the primaries, and the insane amount of foreign money going into Clinton's foundation/slush fund.

It's not bad until it becomes 5, then 10, then 20, then 40 on really stressful days.
I highly doubt this. Until the democrats can unite on an idealogical level, they will continue to be a useless and diminishing force. The GOP is perhaps in the best position out of all of this, because if Trump fails, they can say, oh well he was just that insane outlier and we're not him. This mentality that Trump will ultimately end up empowering democrats is exactly what everyone was saying during the election, and we all know how that turned out.
Was Saddam Hussein worse than ISIS?

I know a handful of people who voted for Trump, and they all voted for Obama.
It's like all politicians at the highest levels have foreign connections that influence them. Why focus on this aspect of Trump like it's super nefarious. Takes away from trying to stop him from the other bad stuff he's doing like the immigration ban and putting bankers in public offices.
Excellent real deep house, as opposed to whatever that new shit they call deep house nowadays.
People should've risen up when he and Bush sold a war on lies. 
If the Democrats hadn't shortsightedly changed the confirmation rules, she wouldn't have been confirmed. They absolutely deserved blame for that part of the equation.
Like our democracy has been anything but shit for at least decades already. 
The influence Russia had over this election is drastically over-stated. Trump didn't win because of the millennial internet vote, he won because Clinton was an awful candidate, and Trump sold a big con to the mid-west, where Clinton didn't bother to campaign.
What I'm curious about is who were the 2.5 million people Obama supposedly deported. Seemingly not people in LA or there would've been at least some fuss.

The last time CNN had a debate with 2 democrats, one of them had the questions before it, and it was a fake debate. Just because Trump's insane and has shitty policies doesn't mean he isn't right about a few things. He's excellent at calling out hypocrisies as long as they don't involve him or his cohorts.
That's what's great about America, you can be poor and uneducated but your children are given the gift of a quality education... oops not anymore.
What's insane to me is that 50% of people seem to think the DNC is not progressive enough, and on the flip side, lots of people are simultaneously alienated from the democrats because they're too liberal. 
Confirmation bias.
The problem isn't that college should be free, the problem is that college's have gotten away with spending insane amounts of money on bullshit and administration, causing the prices to skyrocket. The government needs to crack down on the way colleges spend their money to bring the cost of education down.

My whole thing is, you don't have to like Trump to not buy into the cold war bullshit. I don't like Trump's policies at all, but it's like people want any excuse to get rid of him. And will believe absolutely anything. Even if the worst was true, how is it much different from the Clinton foundation taking loads of checks from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other states? The only way in which this story would be truly awful is if Trump was solely a tool of Russia for the means of actually destroying America, which I find very unlikely.
Lol, you can't baghold expired options.
Anything that Wikileaks wouldn't publish would get leaked to another source. 
The media's 24/7 lambast of Trump is getting so annoying that it makes me hate him less and hate them more.
If you don't have any benzos, I'd suggest taking it in the morning so you'll be able to sleep by the end of the night.
You're giving Wikileaks too much credit. They certainly helped though.
Politifact does this kind of thing all the time. They're probably right that this is an embellishment of what actually occurred, but people reading the headline won't read the whole story, they'll just assume the whole scenario was made up.
It's great except for that occasional "I think I'm having a heart attack" feeling.
If they take Assange down, something tells me he'll go out in a blaze of information glory.
I feel like this whole thing has been blown way out of proportion and is really taking away from more important things like how all the deregulation of banks is going to wreck the economy and the immigration clusterfuck among other things.
I'm not sure if I'm correct, but I believe there was a picture of an F-19  aircraft in one of the cryptic vault 7 tweets, and people all assumed this meant the release would be on February 19th. So, this assumption today was going to be the leak was based solely on speculation.
Eventually these things will be the means to their own end, without any more jobs, nobody will be able to afford to share their money with Uber's robot cars.
I don't like bikes or bike riding, but living in LA, I keep a bike in case I ever need to evacuate because I think if anything serious happened there's a good chance it would be impossible to leave in a car.
It's shilled mostly by Trump supporters, and also Trump haters. And ultimately, it's too focused on Trump/politics.
Adam Curtis has made lot of similar documentaries, the best way I've heard Hypernormalisation described is somewhere between a clear view of what's really happening and an arch conspiracy theory. Anyway, it may be missing some information and is in general a bit rushed/sloppy/full of overstatements, but it's certainly an interesting take on things.
Haha, didn't even have to click to know it was good ole HA Goodman. He will be preaching this same story for the rest of his life or at least as long as Trump's president.
Too bad he's not having a rematch with Andy Lee on the Danny Jacobs undercard. That was a great fight they had the first time. Anyway, I've always thought he seemed like a nice guy so hopefully he gets back on track.
It's the best way. 
The way they're marketing measure s makes me think it's going to pass unfortunately.

WEEABOO STATUS CONFIRMED. i better never see that silly "anime is now illegal" trump meme ever again. 
this isn't as bad as one might think. As an American, soda tastes wildly different here in the states than in Europe. for example- dr. pepper cherry is basically sugary liquid poison that i've consumed more than i care to admit. in Europe a lot of those chemicals are outright illegal or not used. so soda, taste differently and arguably worse by being more natural. \n\ni do want to say this though, those regulations in place in Europe opened my eyes. ever since i found out what European soda tastes like (or at least the European version of dr. pepper), it actually helped me quit drinking soda.  
[R/FULLCOMMUNISM] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FULLCOMMUNISM/)
no. its not bad enough, because it has to reach a point with the american people's outrage is not enough. now it becomes what you can prove without a shadow of a doubt in court. \n\nwhich is an entirely different approach how justice will be delivered. because you also have to keep in mind, that the american public- our interests whatever and how right they may be, are a weak or very small part of the larger picture that will play out. this revolution is very small and has yet to acquire sufficient states. to gain sweeping change with the insiders. california is a blip, washington is another blip. keep fighting.

and this is my entire problem with the state of california as far as its firearm laws are concerned in relation to the rest of the states. i'm sorry but after enjoying the benefits of mainly unregulated gun ownership for a few years now (not a felon, white, and over 21 with previous military experience)- its nice to be able to simply apply for a permit and wait for approval, than having to fear others who simply went on the internet to the thousands of .onion websites to purchase firearms. \n\nbanning of something in a capitalist system means you just created a high demand for a black listed item. \n\nhaving something presented in the market legally and priced accordingly will keep it out of the hands of those without money. \nyou know, like it has been.  \n\ni'm not saying everyone should own a .50 caliber rifle, but if everyone could afford a properly priced one at around 10k, then i think that we would have bigger issues to deal with. like how the median income of some people just tripled. lmao. \n\nmy main grief here is, it does not deter acquisition, it merely creates a black market.

The real difficulty is with the vast wealth and power in the hands of the few and the unscrupulous who represent or control capital. Hundreds of laws of Congress and the state legislatures are in the interest of these men and against the interests of workingmen. These need to be exposed and repealed. All laws on corporations, on taxation, on trusts, wills, descent, and the like, need examination and extensive change. This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations. " -Rutherford B. Hayes

so when are we gonna open up the satan schools for secular children? because public education is gonna be fucking dead for the next generation of children. 
i dont know why this is, but there seems to be a lot of scammers from Brazil. I sold an old phone to this guy, he received it and then wanted to return it because he made something up about how it didn't work. (it did), luckily ebay sided with me, but im pretty sure this guy was hoping i wouldn't reply and he could take the phone and the money.

most jobs drug test in florida. marijuana is still viewed pretty much drug war style. if a cop pulls you over, it really depends on the county. there are 54 counties in florida and majority of them have polar opposite laws on marijuana. from a citation to given a summons for court or just throwing in jail. \n\nbest city for singles? i live in boca, but i often go to ft. lauderdale\n\nrental prices here are overpriced. south florida is largely becoming gentrified, which is fine- but until rent prices stabilize or wages increase, people will continue to work multiple jobs and struggle for disposable income. \n\nalso, the majority of florida's economy here is tourism based, so if you insist on having an IT job, ones related to this industry are your best bet for decent income.

if it was possible, i would personally waterboard all these goddamn corporate liberals. this complete and utter betrayel of progressive values and doing real reporting will never be forgotten. in my eyes, trumps victory was only assured BECAUSE of the media's bias. \n\nthis is all too little to late, we knew they were biased, and anyone showing us this bias AFTER the fact is a piece of shit. i will never watch msnbc ever again. i hope that whole network falls apart.

that's the problem with countries with a very strong social safety net, is that in countries where it is weak or virtually non-existent, or fully, or even partialy co-opted for exploit is that they become targets of economic terrorism. the next step is how fast can this legislation move to stop any further payments and a strong campaign to deter future would be members.

i would run for political office, but i have no money. i find time and time again i am able to articulate clearly complex arguments and i have critical thinking skills. i just think my opinions are too rational and make too much sense that i won't ever get into gov't. plus even if i did, so much money would keep me out of the spotlight. 
this is clever. hahahaha nice.

no.
but muh bible. 
i'll say this now and for as long as this is relevant, jeff sessions shit talked dominicans, so fuck him and i hope he never becomes AG. also, the D.R should become a state at some point along with P.R just saying.

maybe its like stockholms syndrome you know? like the west virginia miners who just put it all on the company store- they drank the kool aid and chose to see it that way, i mean isn't that speaking to something much scarier? people willfully ignore pertinent, relevant and truthful information all the time. especially in the face of comfort and provisional terms for employment. i mean this whole "right to work" legislation/idea is a joke, so yeah corporate america can protect us, when you are on the payroll, but say anything remotely against their agenda? proceed with Brownshirt beatdown of said person.

i kind of can see their point. sports are viewed and justifiably so, as a massive distraction from the horrors of the world. something to sedate the undesirables or whatever the lower classes call themselves. politicizing events that aren't seen as political IS the point. to stir you and provoke your brain and awaken thought. also, this super bowl was politicized from the right just as much so lack of message here really speaks volumes about who liberals and leftist should tolerate or allow as their speakers.

It has a bit of a wind-up where you're immobile, then the serpent attacks from the ground with a circular area of effect. At 50 bloodtinge it deals 800 damage to everything in that area, whether foe or friend. One isn't usually enough to kill someone with one hit, and if the player is nearby the whistle tends to get their attention. I'll roar, then bump them with a whistle, and give them a little time before silencing blanking out. If I get summoned multiple time by the same person, I'll put them down so they don't waste anyone's time. \n\nI think sometimes people forget that if they ring the beckoning bell for a chalice boss, then defeat that boss and proceed to the next area, the bell will still be in effect.
Thanks, I tried, but it didn't come out exactly as planned. Originally there was going to be a 'young' mushroom person holding hands with the large one, and Sieglind beside her father; a sort of fantasy happy ending of sorts. I ran out of time and could only detail the two characters, so that is partly why the sandbar in the foreground is so wide and defined.
The way we have always understood 'attack' is to mean the combat at the end of your turn, so creatures that are on landscapes with frozen counters that are defending against creatures on landscapes without frozen counters would still deal and receive damage. In short, *no, it does not mean the creature can not 'counterattack' when defending*. I can definitely see how one could become confused by the cards wording, though.
I would love to, but none of my local game stores will order any Card Wars products for me, and Hastings is out of business. The decks certainly have top tier cards in them, though.
I'm not so sure. The whole point of it is that it is unknowably intelligent, resilient, and robust. Does it also not just grow mass out of nowhere, defying physics?\nOkay, so your rocket is headed towards the sun. 682 converts some degree of its mass into materials with more volume, breaking it's containment. It then uses some form of organic propulsion to jettison cellular material outward, perhaps in a multistage process, and some degree of material successfully finds its way to Mercury or Venus, where it multiples unhindered by the Foundation, and eventually makes its way back to Earth and beyond.\n\nWhoops. 682 just beat the 'rocket to the sun' test. That is why threads discussing "could X finally kill 682," were banned by the sub rules some time back. The whole point of 682 is that it is the unbeatable choice in rock paper scissors; nothing beats lizard. Nothing.
I've gotten by far more cards since this thread began, but with no reply from anyone, even OP (who is clearly still active and ignoring the messages I sent them). I feel I can safely say no one on this subreddit wants to trade.

Sorry, but that is a fallacious statement. "Dies to removal" isn't a valid reason to discount a card. Tarmogoyf dies to nearly everything in every format, so by your logic it is trash as well.
Anything that scouts for people from that cesspool isn't something worthwhile. Thanks for saving me the time from investigating.
This is probably some form of semantics, but I feel like the goal should not be a *feeling* of safety so much as actually making people safer. There is a threshold of sorts at which, as an effect of *being* safe, people will feel safer. The alternative, a feeling that isn't reflected by reality, is a lie, and I feel I would rather be aware of and acknowledge danger then live in ignorance of its existence. Feeling safe should not be the goal, but one of the ramifications of genuine safety. \n\nSecondly, yeah, super douche. Completely asinine.\n\nI wouldn't say we're as bad as /r/feminism, but that doesn't mean this isn't a pretty hypocritical post. It is discouraging when people are so short-sighted as to make observations like those you mentioned.

Other than free PlayStation Plus games, Bloodborne is still the only game I have, and I'm very satisfied. I love my Bloodborne machine.

Initially I felt betrayed by Bernie. After all of the donations given, and hours invested into phone banking,  for him to turn around and endorse Hillary was a slap in the face. I even considered voting for that blowhard, Trump, in defiance; the logic went something like 'Trump *says* evil things, but Hillary actively *does* evil things,' but then I reflected on what attributes about Bernie I respected and trusted to begin with. Bernie has experience with '*The Game,*' and acts within his morals to do what he feels is right on behalf of we, the people, so perhaps his endorsement of Clinton is a well informed action to achieve what he believes to be the favorable outcome. The cynicism for what is obviously a broken and corrupt system is a constant background radiation, and so perhaps while being swept up in that bitterness I've also allowed myself to be blinded by my vitriol for Clinton, and have lost sight of the goals of the Bernie movement, which wasn't only to get that beautiful old man I to office, but to elicit some real change in the oligarchic and corporate machine. I can't say these ponderings have inspired any want to vote for Hillary, but perhaps they have evoked a guilt not to betray Bernie by casting a vote against him (for Trump). This may very well be the first election I'll have never voted in, because while I'm unsure of casting a vote in direct contradiction to Hillary (for Trump), I'm certain I'll never cast a vote for her, ever.

Agreed.
No, I just want to know who my father is. When my friends talk about the relationship they have with their fathers, or I see families on shows, I know I'm romanticising the notion that if I had a father growing up that things could have been better, but I still want to know.  I run at the park and see fathers with their sons, overhear when them praise their kids, and see how they all interact during events like cookouts, and I can't help but be jealous and bitter that my mother made it impossible for me to know my father. None of this is from social pressure unless you consider other families incidentally living out their lives in proximity to others some sort of cabal. I often wonder if my opposition to having a child of my own is in part the result of being raise by a single parent, and if perhaps I fear being a poor father for my child, because I had no positive male role models growing up, but I'll never know for certain. All I know is sometimes I feel empty, and I wish that I had a father, and I wonder if I had, would he tell me he is proud of me?
True. Good thing the sign says eradicate, though.
Not sure why you were down voted for this, unless there is a Nazi sympathizer somewhere in here? You're correct, though; unfortunate cropping, for sure.
I finally understand the shame ex-feminists must feel when the reflect on what Feminism has become. I've considered myself an MRA for quite some time now, but perhaps it is time to abandon the title so people will take or message seriously. This is *clearly* a joke.\n\nEdit: you know what? This is the cancerous post that finally motivated me to unsubscribe from this sub. I wholeheartedly agree there are a plethora of challenges that boys and men face every day, not only from engrained cultural discrimination, systematic mutilation, weighted judicial systems, and, well, frankly just the fallout from Feminism™, but this sub has become a parallel echochamber to those we have demonized all along. This isn't a place for men to help raise up and aide the rights of men, but a marathon butthurt circlejerk. I remember how upset I was the first time I saw the way we were portrayed on Parks and Rec; it isn't spot on, but I'm realizing it wasn't too far from the truth. Goodbye for now, brothers. If you ever want to engage in something meaningful, try /r/menslib. It isn't ideal, but is a hell of a lot better than whatever this is.

Put simply, was it ever not dead? People have zero interest in it where I am locally, and I haven't been able to get anyone interested in trades online. It is fun, for sure, but I would say it was dead on arrival.
You've got me there. I retract my condescending tone and apologize.
They *are* good, but many of the people that donated had their EDH playset with a backup (four for constructed, one for EDH, and five just in case) and wanted new players to use whatever caught their eye, so in they went. It is why I can't bring myself to loot the collection (I admit I sold a couple Sensei's Diving Top to invest in boxes to store the rest). Magic can be intimidating for new players, so I try to lower the price wall a little if I can, so if they quit it isn't purely because of income restrictions. Vets have tons of cards they don't use or need, so it is healthier for the community as a whole. If you're ever in western Arkansas I'll hook you up.
It is difficult to balance working on things that are fun to make (and only improve on these things you're already good at) and making things that are frustrating, but ultimately improve your ability in those areas (for most people these are hands, feet, faces, and perspective).\nKudos on the game dev; I do a Ludum Dare now and then but I only do the sprite sheets while my friend codes. My first dare made me really respect devs, because it is easy to forget all of the work that goes into even the most seemingly rudimentary things. 
I love this guy, and really love this recipe. Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for the information. Interesting perspective to ruminate on.
This is clearly inspired by the painting [Saturn Devouring His Son."](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son) Not *sort of like* as many are relating to so much as a contemporary remix of the painting.
Where is the straw man? So far utnow has directly referred to your words verbatim, and not any secondary argument, failing to meet the criteria for a strawman fallacy. If anything, technically you're making a strawman of /u/utnow by addressing a strawman he or she never created. \n\nAs for the term bigot, it isn't an insult as much as a description, and it is up to the individual to determine whether or not they feel insulted, so if you subjectively decided to be insulted for being called out for bigotry, I suggest you either toughen up, or be less of a bigot. You literally said that [all] Americans are self entitled and pathetic, generalizing the entire group, and being intolerant to their beliefs, which is the definition of being a bigot.
You nailed it. I'm fairly regular at the Curiosity Shoppe and Hawghead Comics. Let me know if you're ever around.
We don't talk about Jay like that anymore
Butthurt wasn't the appropriate way to put it, but for sure you are so upset about one of the primary driving mechanics of the game that you needed to type out a whole paragraph about it. The people invading you had to complete the game at low soul levels to have access to the gear they have, overcoming many personal barriers until they earned what they have, and are using that gear as the game intended, *just like you can!* There is even an option built into the game where you can opt out of being invaded by them if you so choose to ignore that other people are playing this game to have fun as well, and that is to go hollow, or play offline by yourself. \n\nI got slaughtered by invaders constantly on my early play throughs, but you know what? I got better. **So should you.** Don't let them break you, but let their power and skill inspire you to improve yourself. This isn't the real world where if you're not born without privilege you almost certainly can't attain it; Dark Souls is *fair,* everyone is equal, and everyone eventually *dies.* It is up to you if you go hollow or get back up again and git gud.
A friend of mine sets up and repairs the CCTV for the multiple public schools in the district my wife teaches at. He has joked before that there are by far more cameras than most people would imagine. There are even obvious ones put in places to draw the eye from hidden ones. He said the most irritating to install were the ones in trees around the parking lots.\nWe didn't have cameras installed when I was in school or college, but there sure are now.
Similar experience here. I usually poked them to death with long range weapons in Darkwood and ran past them near Ash Lake, so I thought I would try punching the ones in Dark Root to death. They're one of my favorite mobs all because of that melancholy wind up, followed by that full-body extension for maximum range. Of all the spooky-scary mobs in this game, those guys make me more nervous than just about everything else combined.
> There is no boss in the game as bad as a twink in +15 armour with a +10 lightning weapon and a +5 ascended pyro flame attacking you when you have not even reached the first smith. Plus the twink has probably been playing since launch and you just picked up the game. Good luck with that.\n\nI wasn't clear enough for you, so I will reiterate:\nMy solution is to keep trying, because one should succeed at the Parish in a dozen or fewer attempts. Even if one is killed three or four times by a hostile invader it should be no more frustrating than the dozens of attempts one will likely make at tougher bosses in the game. You will not get invaded every single time, and repeating the same few enemies in a row under the pressure of a potential invasion during your first playthrough will teach you patience and technique, two invaluable qualities for the Bloodsouls franchises. If one wishes to succeed on their first try they are either playing the wrong game or in need of practice, because Dark Souls is a game that rewards those who play more.\n\n> Because the PvE game is actually a well-balanced challenge. Twink invasions are not.\n\nThe pvp is balanced in the aspect that being invaded is not a certainty, and one can gang up multiple allies against a single invader. There is even the classic fallback of just running to the next boss rather than wasting enough time to be invaded. It also seems like a clear choice for any player that if one is being constantly invaded in an area one is unfamiliar with, that it would be best to explore the area hollow until the terrain and enemy placement isn't a mystery, then go human and spring for summon signs. These are only some of the strategies one could try to make areas easier, but I know one of the least helpful is whining about it online instead of playing the game.\n\n> Sounds like someone already did that to your breakfast cereal, I'll pass thanks.\n\nYou simply must tell me how one can learn to fabricate such a witty retort. My guffaw could nary be contained by one so boisterous as you!\nBut really, though, I just don't get how one could be so flustered at the suggestion of *trying.* Perhaps you have been supremely skilled in your other endeavors in life, and you've stumbled upon one experience that doesn't agree with you? If so, congratulations, but it took me no short amount of time and a good deal of research on the wikis before I considered myself an adept player, and the same is true for most players. The fact is that these are the mechanics of the game and they can't be changed, so instead of crying about how unfair it is, learn how to cope and survive or let those of us who want to learn and grow do so in peace.
True, but the actual branching point isn't until much later. I was agreeing that it isn't all that different of a plot, just a different conclusion. The mistakes one can make aren't different branches or paths in the plot, but items one can overlook that change the conclusion, and only the conclusion, and only immediately before that conclusion.\n\nedit: typos, not proofreading until after posting.
I can't find his penis in the video; are we watching the same one?
When did I say Central Arkansas was a utopia? It has lots of great things to offer, and most of the people are good, but a few of them that aren't (or weren't) got away with passing of propaganda as a real education. I'm not mistaken about the experience because I was horrified by it even then: My science teacher, that taught 7th, 8th, and 9th grade, began one of our first days of class by saying if we believed in the nebular theory that we should raise our hands. Only I did. She then did the same regarding the big bang, and later relativity. I was dubbed a 'Satan-worshipper,' by most, and by some an atheist, but no one bothered to actually ask my spiritual beliefs. I was ostracized through all of school for having these beliefs, so the experience was very memorable. They may be exaggerated by the lens of time, but I don't believe that to be so.
TIL that I can use my pocket watch again because the '4' isn't wrong, but tastefully different.

Thank you very much for sharing!
Come see it in person at the Crystal Bridges Museum in Arkansas. I couldn't believe how large it is!
Why would anyone do that..? It is to keep trying, because being killed 3-4 times might be frustrating, but no more than any other boss in the game. My question is why are people playing a challenging game, then crying that it is too challenging? The entire culture around Dark Souls is that it is difficult but ultimately possible through perseverance and personal growth. If you think the advice "don't give up, you can do it" is bad, you're playing the wrong game.\n\nHey, I think there are some uplifting Bob Ross videos on YouTube that could be put in their place; why don't you go shit all over those?
Valid argument. I was clearly short-sighted here.
That is a pretty sentiment, but it is more likely they steal your television, gasoline, AND kill you, so you can't tell anyone who stole your TV and gas. Theft and murder tend to go hand in hand, especially when people are panicking, so if you have anyone or anything worth protecting it is better to have and not use a gun than need one and end up gargling for blood in the mud along side your spouse and children.
Fellow sunbro here should you need some coordinated aide here or there. I have a handful of characters across different levels, so I could probably get in there wherever you are.\nDon't go hollow. It's us against them.\n\nPraise it! \\[T]/
Very true. I'm sure mine is a much more uncommon, isolated example, but if my school was allowed to go so far off track I'm sure many others did as well. And your correct in that the most accurate description is that these are anecdotal.
I also use my Bloodborne box for Netflix, Hulu, HBOGo, and playing music and video. My PS4 came with other games (some Final Fantasy and Diablo 3) but I've never needed to even try them because Bloodborne has been the only game I've needed since launch (I've given some PS+ free downloads a few hours here and there, admittedly. Super Meat Boy and Broforce were great bonus downloads!).
Can you link me to the debunking? I can't find it.
I've been playing for a long time and coordinated a sort of freebie pool in college where I made decks for new players and gave them to anyone interested, or let them dig in and take anything that strikes their fancy. Veteran players would open a few booster boxes or cases and donate what didn't offer a quick return. There ended up being far more cards going in than coming out, and it went on for a decade. Now I couldn't sell them if I tried because no one wants to go through them. I have about 20k sorted by color, then modern vs classic border, and the moderns mostly sorted by set.\nPeople saw I truely wasn't seeking to benefit from the donations, so some gave more freely than usual. Years ago, after drafts and prerelease, people would keep their value cards and hand me piles of 'chaff.' I've been tempted to sift through and trade some up, but if a newbie finds use in a Wild Nacatyl, Monestary Swiftspear, Relic of Pyrogenious, etc., more power to them. \n\nSeriously, it just snowballs.
Thanks for the tip.
The thing is, you DO have access to everything they do, and from soul level one, just like you do. They went out, got it, and came back, *just like you can.* I'm afraid you'll have to find another reason to be butthurt here.
I wanted to pick one of these up at Gen Con in Indianapolis this year, but Cryptozoic said they had a shipping error and only had one unit for sale per day (four), and I never made it in time. I already had everything set up to do an unboxing for you all, but no luck. They also wanted $25 per normal set, which seemed high, even for Gen Con, but there was a whole seller there that had the first four decks available for $6 each, so I couldn't stop myself from finishing my sets of three.
To be honest, the Finn vs Jake decks felt like the most unbalanced of the collector packs so far (I haven't gotten a chance to play Fionna and Cake yet, but it seems alright). The lane change mechanic for Blue Plains is just too slow against Jake's aggressive Corn Field deck. There are some tools that have come out since then that finally make a lane switching deck viable, but out of the box it was pretty abysmal. I can try to outline some general tricks with the deck if you would like, though.\n\nIf it helps to reflect my point of view, the only other card game I've really played in the last ten years has been Magic the Gathering, so deck building isn't new to me, heh.

And how does one reach the abandoned workshop without defeating the Blood Starved Beast..?
I'll have to double check on the character level, but I'm about to start a NG (third or fourth play through, I didn't keep track). My PSN is the same as this one.\n\nI could probably start around 8am Central Standard Time tomorrow if you would be interested?
They're eluding to Trump. Google it.
This has to be one of my favorite cosplay weapons I've seen posted here. I really enjoy the your execution of the 'trick' mechanism.
Did you ever find anyone? If there were some particular cards you're looking for from the booster packs I could help you out?
This is an amazing idea. You may have just saved my Valentine's Day from a fate worse than mediocrity. Thank you!
Yeah, a bit sarcastic. I mean, it isn't *really* cheating, but it is an exploit of sorts. I completely understand not having time to complete the game three times, but not *wanting* to... no way. There aren't as many possible builds in this game, but there are still plenty of them.\n\nI wouldn't change the game, but I do feel like one of the weaker points of the game is that all three branches of the end story are rooted at the same event in the plot. I'm not saying it is bad, just sub-optimal.
When you see someone eating and think "oh shit, I haven't eaten today; I should get something," are you conceding to social pressures, or are you just hungry?\n\nSometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Still awaiting that unboxing, and [it should be out already..!](https://www.cryptozoic.com/adventure-time-card-wars-doubles-tournament-game)
It is the same mentally of having a gym membership; when I work out at home, I'm less likely to exercise proper form or commit to the routine, but when I'm at the gym, I had to get dressed and travel all the way here, so I'm here to *get shit done.* When I'm in my room, distraction was within arm's length on all sides, but at the library, especially when I'm surrounded by (quiet) studious peers, I can lose myself and track of time at the task at hand. For another example, this post was made from my dedicated redditing room, the lavatory, because it has my favorite chair for the purpose.
About eight pounds.
Your ideas clearly don't mesh with what the MRM is trying to accomplish and you have no place here with your toxic attitude. Feel free to spew your ichor, but you'll be down voted, reported, and hidden.
So true. A lot of people think fluids/thermo/heat transfer are the hardest, but I really liked those and did well in them. On the other hand, I dislike controls and had a huge mental block when it came to my signal processing course. Signal processing was easily my hardest class simply because I couldn't find any relevance to what I was doing or what I wanted to do.
500k, that's a good start, you've covered like 30 people for a year! Just 350 million to go!
But the historic, geographical, and science portions leave much to be wanted. My school (Central Arkansas) taught me the Revolutionary War was about taxes on tea (and that is all), the Civil War was only about slave ownership, and that evolution wasn't true, just as the moon, stars, and other celestial bodies weren't really some magic "floating orbs in space," but propaganda Satanists had implemented to indoctrinate children into becoming homosexual serial killers (the same reason Pokemon cards, unnatural hair colors, and yo-yos were banned on school grounds). I won't even start on the nebular and big bang theories. World War 2 was glanced over in places, especially the 'harsh judgement' of the Jews by the Nazis, because something about how "the ends justify the means, and one has to understand that is just how people felt at the time, so it wasn't so bad. Look at all the good they learned, too, and it only cost the world a few Jews." \n\nGeography wise, they taught us continents, and at one point we had to label a map of the British Isles, but not much was specified in their meaning, so we believed they were different countries. Just... no. The American education system is extremely lacking if this was the core curriculum of even a single county in the 1990s. It's pathetic.
This is the very reason I only search co-op dungeons with my bloodtinge build anymore. If I get summoned to the same afk player more than once, I silence their ringing with Madras trusty whistle. I don't like killing players that were looking for help, but all the afk ones are doing is preventing me from helping people that are paying attention, and therefore wasting my time.
I hated that particular giant until he clicked for me, and now I love all of the undead giants. You described it much more elequently, however.
Magnetic fields and polarity.
**Update:** they announced the winners, and *I got first place* in the adult category! I never win anything, so this is amazing! Dark Souls inspired me to win a $150 gift card for Dick Blick! The game that keeps on giving!
I'll admit, from what I've heard DS3 seems more balanced, but I've yet to get to test it because even thoI have by far an excess of resources to run the game, it just... doesn't. I get about five seconds before I'm dropped for low framerate. I have nearly four hours on record via Steam, but those are literally just me restarting the game after reinstalling, updating drivers, tinkering with settings, etc. \n\n\nI never said that the design of multiplayer is perfect, but the game is quite popular, and the gameplay isn't going to change any time soon, so it is best to understand the mechanics and cope as best as possible. Yes, some invasions feel like we've just rolled a natural critical failure leading to a hilariously one sided defeat, but sometimes the same is true with the PvM in general; we've all had that one time we, completely by accident, dodged the Capra Demon at just the right angle that when the hounds lunged the moment afterwards we came out ready to ascend the stairs (or a similar analogy). Dark Souls feels like an uphill battle interspersed with randomization to keep things loose. The multiplayer, with its cosplayers, 'twinks' as you say, sun bros, dick wraiths, giantdads, forest bros, gankers, etcetera, are the diversity that make Dark Souls great. The cock-monger that one-shot me a few times from the catwalk in the Burg with fireballs on my first play throughs made it that much greater when I was invaded by a player with the mask of the child (extra creepy if you've never seen it before), lighting the way through the Burg with prism stones, pulling switches and dropping hard souls and titanite to reward me. It is partly the reason I still invade with my lvl13 giantdad to this day; people are so expectant of jackassery it is almost a joke when you pop in to help. I do the same thing on Bloodborne (I ring the sinister bell at Mergo's Loft and make a mad dash for the lever to release the [spoiler creature] so new players won't get mental molested by the Winter Lanterns). \n\nI get that giantdads can make the game discouraging for new players, but from my perspective it seems like the kinds of players who are so easily dissuaded are the kind who likely would have quit in Sen's Fortress, Blighttown, the catwalks in Anor Londo, the bridge with the Greatbow Archers, the boss fight in Anor Londo, Tomb of the Giants, New Anor Londo, and elsewhere. It is a punishing game that quickly loses its challenge without self imposed handicaps, or rather it would, were it not for a player base with broad intentions to enrich the experience. I mean, sure, we can complain about the players we don't like, but that won't make them go away, and in the end, I believe the game is richer for having them.\n\nApologies if this reads like gibberish, I'm on mobile and don't have time to fuss with proofreading at the moment.
Ask Google; they'll probably know, and reply even sooner.
I can feel that. I'm not saying you're absolutely wrong, because there is a possibility that were I raised in a vacuum where I wasn't aware that fathers were an option or even existed, maybe I wouldn't have this empty feeling when I see others. I've been wrestling with this dilemma for a couple decades; I often wonder if I'm just being a petulant child, vying for the approval of a father I never had but didn't need, or are my emotions valid?
No, *misandry* isn't a  big problem in India. The word you're thinking of is *misogyny,* which is the polar opposite of misandry. 
I'll post it here because the comment I was replying to has since been deleted (something to the effect of "they should be dead"), and this comment chain seems the most appropriate:\n\n> https://reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/53tnch/meta_could_we_please_stop_with_the_revenge/\n\n> Or maybe they could go to trial? From the way the article is worded, and the charges brought up, it sounds like an 11 year old girl decided she wanted to be a grown woman, and ran away from home with the intention to have sex with multiple partners. The two men are disgusting for going through with it, but it is worded as if she voluntarily had intercourse with a man after propositioning him online, then after being dropped off, propositioned another, went back to his place, and had concesentual intercourse there, too, before going to Walmart and calling Dad for a ride home. The men are clearly in the wrong for taking advantage of what is obviously a disillusioned child, but the blame doesn't seem to fall entirely on the men in this case. I bet if more emotionally damaged eleven year old children walked around asking strangers to fuck them, *they would.* This is all speculation from the information given, but my point is that we can't just murder every person the media suggests is guilty, and we definitely shouldn't be at home stroking our revenge boners every time someone does something we disagree with.\n\n> I have to agree with /u/pbjandahighfive in that there desperately needs to be an investigation into this child's home life and into what drove her to seek out and have sex with these men. It sounds like she was familiar with the acts she was committing, so either she gained access to media she shouldn't have had, or she was shown voluntarily, likely by family or a friend, and if the latter, there could be other children out there being sexually abused by their own family or friends while we focus on the two yokels. This could be indicative of a sexual predator, and we're ostracizing the two idiots that didn't instigate the intercourse, but likely wouldn't have considered it were they not propositioned. Again, speculation with limited information, but not altogether unlikely.\n\n\n> Also, just keep your shitpost revenge-murder-porn fantasies out of here, because they have no place in this subreddit.
Try searching the subreddit for the dozens of other identical posts before wasting everyone's time (including your own) with this post. You're posting asking for an opinion to something you could easily determine with less than five minutes of reading reviews and watching YouTube videos.
He said he cunt hair you. You muff have something in your ears.
You are technically correct, but by warping of the general interpretation of the language. For example, I could say you're a *shit spewing asshole*, by which one could assess my meaning in that from a post consumer culture point of view, you are little more than the impact you have by consuming goods and media, and so you are little more than what is in many ways extruded from you, and the fact that you propogate it outwardly. This would be incongruous with my true intention, which is to say you're a rude and asinine fustilarian. \nEnhance your calm, feculence trough.
I found [this cool website](http://bfy.tw/9YRk) that has links to lots of Bloodborne phone wallpapers.
Realize that lift acts perpendicular to velocity. Also realize that wings producing lift produce downwash.  Assuming your freestream velocity vector is purely horizontal, the lift vector would point straight up. However, the downwash adds a vertical velocity component to the flow seen by the wing. Your new "effective" velocity on the wing is tilted downward. Lift acts perpendicular to this velocity, so the lift vector points slightly backward. The horizontal component of this lift vector is the induced drag, aka drag due to lift.
Not only that, but in a way it vindicated the Foundation for all of their questionable containment techniques (sadistic rituals, etc.), because as far as I can tell, his proposal was basically a group of demohumans using martyrs to contain/dispel chaos/entropy. Multidimensional primordial humanity powers the universe with love and suffering, because either many suffer for the few, or all suffer for none. The play is like hearing a select few vetted agents doing what they do best: frightened, but improvising and performing their necessary parts to maintain containment. They feel human, just like the agents and overseers we are familiar with, and yet vexing, because they're never fully explained.\n\nThe delivery of the narrative seems to have been confusing for many, but I think it will serve it better in the long term: it is like how a joke that everyone understands immediately isn't as funny as the joke only a few are privy to, or that takes some time to click. It requires a little speculation, making connections between fragments and perspectives, and retrying if assumptions didn't work out (read: effort). Some people don't like to work for their entertainment, and for those who prefer to be spoon fed, this isn't written for them. Better to stick with 682, 173, or 096, where the danger is a clearly defined monster exposed to the light of day, rather than a shrouded mystery that requires inspection.
Like I said before, fight fire with fire. I have a level 13 Giantdad just for helping people through the parish. If you can spare the humanity I would be glad to help. The flip side of the potential to be invaded is that you can also summon allies to help you.
> I saw this at the art museum in Bentonville, Arkansas last summer.\n\nftfy\n\nYep, she still lives here at Crystal Bridges. I highly encourage anyone to come see her in person; the painting is much larger than expected, and there are so many details that I haven't seen captured anywhere digitally.
My wife is an art teacher, and the most important advice we give anyone is to keep trying. Like music or any other hobby, it can be discouraging when we compare ourselves to people who are naturally talented or already very skilled, but all you see/hear is the end result, not the countless hours it takes over months and years to hone and refine that talent.\nAnyone can 'art,' provided you have limbs for arting and the determination to keep trying.
I feel like what /u/all-round-good-egg was posing was more rhetorical than serious, being more of a paradox that forces a hypothetical Feminist™ to chose between two contradicting ideas that Feminism™ seems to support. Something like:\n\nHey, Feminism™! Pick one!\n\n* Public funding exists to help with public fertility because one's child being of their own genetic lineage is invaluable.\n\n* Parents bond with non genetic offspring, and so men are financially responsible for any child their partner produces regardless of genetic lineage between the proposed 'father' and 'child.'\n\nThat was my attempt to paraphrase on their behalf. \nWhy the capital 'F' trademark? Let's not all keep pretending modern Feminism™ isn't a business venture first and foremost, with all goals being profits, and none being human equality. Every business needs a product, and Feminism™'s product is hypocrisy, so eat it up.
No one seemed to notice, but I have trouble finding anyone in real life that claims to play any Dark Souls. It's a real good in my life, ha.
There are other ways to cheat as well, but that doesn't make them the right way :p
How is your conclusion that he's turned on beyonce? He tells the crowd that she threw him and drake under the bus, then he says that she's still great but is letting politics get in the way too much. Sounds to me like beyonce has no loyalty.
I have nothing to add other than I'm in the same boat. I do FSAE and ASME, I have a ~3.5, I've sent hundreds of applications, but I didn't get any internship offers and now companies don't look twice at my resume because of it. I'd always heard that jobs are more about who you know except for in engineering where it's more about what you know, so I thought engineering was a field that someone like me--a first generation college student with no industry connections--could build a solid life around on my own. These last two years of searching for a job have convinced me otherwise. It's the worst feeling. 
Every one of your points means precisely nothing. Did he vote for trump? No. Who is impacted by their friendship? No one. What effect does an autograph have on anyone? None. \n\nYall need to chill the fuck out. You act like republicans have an airborne disease that you contract if you even look at them. Watch colbert's video from right after the election. We're not defined by our political affiliation.
>There were so many times where I needed items to rebuild my bank\n\nThis has never happened to me and probably hasn't happened to most of the osrs community. Maybe you're just playing wrong.
>If you drop a pro player into a bronze game, they will carry\n\nI can't speak on bronze games because I have no idea the skill level of players there. I'm talking about 4200+ games where everyone is somewhat closely matched in skill. You can drop the number 1 genji player in the world into a 4200+ game, and the other team can work around it to make him just another genji. That genji player can easily be out-carried by the right teamwork, or his team can work with him to beat the other team. Either way, it's never a 1-man effort.

Don't forget how ~~st. Tropez's~~ '03 Adolescence beat was straight up stolen from a small time producer who uploaded it on soundcloud.
Anyone defending Cole made their choice. He straight up says Kanye can't make good music anymore and he has a fake wife. If you call that a good criticism of the man (while he's on his way out of the hospital), I question whether or not you were ever a fan.
I went from spending ~30 hours per week on schoolwork to 70+ hours per week for five semesters. This was due to three main factors: I got all of the easy gen eds out of the way before transferring, I joined university clubs, and the university courses were higher level and harder. \n\nAs for preparedness, I really wasn't behind most of my classmates. It really depends on your CC though. My CC is one of the better ones, and they feed a lot of students into the 4-year school I went to. I also tried really hard in CC and made sure to obtain as much knowledge as possible. \n\nPut a lot of work into your math and science classes at CC and you'll be fine. \n\nMore importantly than classes, start looking for internships and co-ops EARLY. Look for government ones while you're in CC. Join the most relevant clubs you can IMMEDIATELY after transferring. You'll have to catch up to the 2 years of project experience that your classmates (job competitors) already have, and finding a job will be harder than any class you have to take. 
I've had several interviews. I'm curious, what do you specifically mean by the "hustle?"
You can't go wrong picking electives that you're interested in. Also this is probably just anecdotal and doesn't apply to everyone, but the mechEs I know who are doing a CS minor are very well-off right now. 
I just thought about why CNN (and news outlets in general) don't fire these idiots after fuckups like this, and I realized that they probably hire people specifically because they're stupid. Dumb people typically are more entertaining, vocal, and sure of their opinions, so people are more likely to watch. This is a win for CNN and a loss for the general public that watches it.
Will do in the future. I actually couldn't have done that this time around though because they all went on break the following week. The interviews were on Tuesday, and the following day when I sent my thank you emails, I was already getting automated replies letting me know they were out of the office until January. If I chose to call them that Friday, I would have had to play a guessing game about who is still in the office and willing to answer the phone. I pretty much just put trust in them to deliver like they said they would. I suppose I could have tried contacting them the first day or week they got back from break, but it just didn't seem like a good time. They just got off of break and were starting a new year, I figured if I started pestering them right off the bat they would definitely reject me whereas otherwise there was still a slight chance of being hired.\n\nAnyway, I'll probably send an email to my host from the interview day, and I'll follow up sooner after future interviews.\n\n\nedit: Another thing impacting my decision-making here is I was originally contacted for my first phone interview in October. The person I interviewed with told me I would be contacted by a coworker "soon." I wasn't contacted until two months later. So, using this logic, when they told me I would know by the end of the week, I didn't know whether they really meant it or they would take several weeks as they had before.
Why exactly do some private companies ask if you've ever worked for the government? If you've worked for the government in the past, can you be ineligible for certain jobs?
I've lived in two really good apartments, both of which took less than a week to find. It's incredibly easy.

Kinda late to the thread here. Everyone is voicing their opinion about how you're a bad person if you talk shit about your teammates' personal struggles (and that's true), but I want to add that **you will also be forever bad at the game itself if you do this.** Take it from a top 500 player; toxicity will always hold you back.
What you're describing is "doing their job," not carrying. Yes, doing your job well makes it more likely that you will win, but it's never enough to guarantee the win. Teamwork is the only "carry" in the game, and that, by definition, can't be accomplished by a single player. 
I don't play the game. My point is that new players see what the game has become, and they either leave or they fall in with the rest of you and miss out on what rs is supposed to be.
I know we're goofing and gaffing here but this one seems especially fucked up to me. 
Alright then why did he even have teammates if they were that bad? Just save the money and only have Lebron out there.
Lmao you brought basketball into a discussion I was having about overwatch, what do you mean. \n\nMy point with my last comment was to make you realize that teammates do something even if it may not seem like it.
Can you read? I never said adding shift-clicking won't make the game easier. Shift clicking will make the vanilla game easier, but it still won't make it as easy as it is with ahk/mouse keys. \n\nI used resizeable as an example to explain to you that there are updates in the game that make the game easier without adding new content. Shift-clicking won't add new content and it will make the game easier, just like the resizeable update did. It's pretty hypocritical for you to cry about these types of updates now when you didn't back then.\n\nI'm done arguing with you though. The poll will pass and you'll just have to deal with it.
I have a BSME and I see where you're coming from. The setup is advanced math and physics that the average person wouldn't understand, but it's a relatively simple problem in the engineering world. I remember learning about pendulum dynamics like this and thinking, "is that really all it takes?" The computer does 90% of the work.

Delete this dude otherwise no one will be repairing soon 
Fresh ME grad here. I have a dream job and a dream industry that I'd like to work in, but I haven't had any luck getting an offer in the field due to my lack of work experience. I have a ton of educational and extracurricular experience in said field, but I've never actually worked for a company that deals with this topic. My question is, if I take a job that is somewhat unrelated to my dream job, how difficult will it be down the line to move back into the field? How much of a deciding factor does your first job out of college have on the rest of your career?
>He never actually said that he supported Trump. If he did, he would have them actually voted for him.\n\nThis is all anyone needs to know tbh. People are freaking out because the controversial Kanye West said something controversial, but his actions are what count here.
[Here's the thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/2qikbo/03_adolescence_j_cole_beat_is_super_similar_to/) Turns out it was 03' adolescence and the file has since been deleted, but the comments serve as a reminder. The creator and most of the people who replied don't seem bothered by it, but it was essentially a 100% match. I understand that sampled songs can sound similar depending on the way they were sampled, but these two beats were sampled in exactly the same way. I don't think it was just a coincidence. 
Good to know, thanks a lot!
My dad is one of the unlucky ones for sure. He's unlucky for a lot of personal reasons that I won't get into, but one thing I can talk about is the light ALWAYS turns yellow as he's approaching. It's pretty remarkable actually. 
If that were true, there would be no updates. No raids, no zulrah, no pets, no rooftop agility, no resizeable fullscreen, no "always right click" options, the list goes on. If you're playing osrs, you're not living in the past anymore. Runescape branched off in 2007; one branch is rs3, the other is osrs. Both versions are free to update as they like.
Great video. Do you happen to have the title of the song in the intro?
I also voted herblore. I think a good skill is one that offers each of three options: slow exp/high profit, fast exp/no profit, or something in between. Almost every skill in the game functions in this way. Herblore, to my knowledge, only offers the fast exp/no profit option, making it nothing more than a money-sink 99. Construction and firemaking used to be the same, but jagex has done a great job giving those skills more variety and purpose. It's incredibly worthwhile to level up construction now, and Wintertodt offers a new option for firemaking. They also made moves with farming by offering the Tithe minigame. Farming is generally slow exp/decent profit (if doing herbs), so jagex introduced a fast xp/low profit option for players. I'm hoping they update herblore somehow to at least give it a medium xp/breakeven option. 
I'd like to hear some working engineers' opinions on what I should do here. \n\nSome backstory about me: I've had the hardest time finding an internship and now a job. I graduated last December with a BSME from a top 10 engineering school, and despite my best efforts (decent GPA, ASME and FSAE involvement, applying to 160+ internship postings in two semesters), I never received an internship offer. During my last semester of college, I lowered my rate of applying significantly because I felt it was pointless. I applied to maybe 10-15 entry level jobs during that semester. Surprisingly, I was contacted to interview for three of those jobs, but of course, I didn't receive an offer for any of them. I took a complete break from applications and engineering in general during January, but I'm getting back in the swing of things now. \n\nAt the moment, I'm in the running for two jobs. One job seems pretty cool and I think I would really enjoy the location. The other job doesn't seem that great and I really don't want to live in its location. However, both jobs are in manufacturing which is an area that I can't see myself spending more than five years in. I haven't gotten any offers yet, but if I do, they'll be expecting me to accept or decline within a week or two. \n\nI have no interest in becoming a manufacturing engineer. I was really good at fluids, heat transfer, and solid mechanics in school and in my projects, but dynamics and controls were by far my weakest subjects. From what I can tell, these positions are primarily controls-based. They also mentioned that there would be no design work.\n\nSo, my question is: since I've had such a hard time finding my first job, should I take a job that I know I will hate for 2-3 years, or should I keep applying and hope I get an offer for something more in-line with my interests? Keep in mind, I've interviewed for several internships and entry-level jobs that are more in-line with my interests, but I've never had any luck. In addition, if I work a manufacturing job for 2-3 years, will I even be able to get design or analyst engineer job, or will I be stuck in manufacturing for my entire career?\n\nThank you if you managed to read my wall of text.
Transfer student here. As the others have said, the transfer cluster is one of the easiest ways to meet people. However, you can make friends at any point during college. I met a ton of people during my time in the transfer cluster and I still talk to some, but I met my best friends when I was looking for an apartment. If you just put yourself out there (go to social events, join RSOs, etc.), you'll be fine.
I took a history class once
His mom died this month in 2007, I wonder if that has anything to do with all this.
What's your opinion on Cole calling Kanye's wife fake?
It could drown out enemy ults though. I'd rather hear an enemy rein scream "hammer down" than hear my mercy telling me she's on fire.
There will still be high profile companies there. Whether or not they have the position you're looking for is a different story. 
He forgot to mention that we have the best memes

I had a lot of classmates in my middle school who were constant trouble makers, so the teachers would reward them with snacks and drinks any time they just acted normally. That's what gucci mane has become. He stopped all his sketchy shit and is being a normie now, but everyone thinks he's the greatest. Well where are my snacks? Where are my juice boxes? Life is unfair.
I'm not so sure about that. I've never seen this exact notation (what is 'm'?), but I do know that arc length, aka "the measure of the arc," is a measurement of length, not angle. Therefore, the length of AXB cannot be 246 degrees, and thus cannot be subtracted from 360 degrees to find the answer. Radius (or diameter) is required to relate arc length to angle, and unless the radius is given off-screen, this problem is incomplete.\n\nAlso the overall lack of units in this problem is a big red flag when it comes to the validity of the author.
I'd say take diffeq first. DiffEq had basically zero linear algebra when I took it, but linear algebra had a few instances of diffeq. Also diffeq is basically calc 4 so if you care about order, take diffeq first.
So true. Back when I played in 06/07, there was a magic to just playing the game and exploring. I came back last summer and noticed that literally everything you can possibly do in rs has been recorded and tabulated online. Back in the day, you'd have to bank everything but 3 items when you were walking into new territory because you weren't sure whether or not you'd die there. Now, just look it up online. There's no fun in that. In the quest to be the richest or most efficient, a lot of players have missed out on the sense of adventure that an MMORPG is supposed to have.
Yeah he was doing whatever the fuck he wanted long before he was rich. I think it was his breakfast club interview where he said he wore suits and slicked his hair back every day in middle school. 
>Mechanical = Failed aerospace students. Could help if they spelled "aerospace" correctly.\n\nOuch, I hope this isn't a common stereotype in industry. I was choosing between mech and aero and picked mech because it was much more competitive and offered a more in-depth learning experience. Aero majors don't even have labs or lab reports until their senior year at my alma.
I also had a project like this in high school physics. In my experience with these projects, the design isn't as important as the craftsmanship. My little bridge beat the entire class in the [applied load]/[bridge weight] category because, instead of spending all my time coming up with a complex design, I spent my time making sure the bridge was as sturdy and well-made as possible. Most other bridges failed due to some defect in the glue or some asymmetry. \n\nSo if you ever have a load-bearing project like these, make sure your product is well made!

I graduated this December and have been searching for an internship/job for over 2 years, so I know what it's like to have no luck. I've developed a pretty decent understanding of the engineering job market. Only continue reading if you want someone to give it to you straight.\n\n\nGrad school is probably your only option if you want to work in engineering. The bottom line is companies want to make money. They don't care about making sure everyone has a job, they just care about bringing people into the company who will do their jobs and turn a profit. You need to demonstrate that you are someone who will be better at that than their other candidates, but that will be nearly impossible to do with a 1.5 year gap on your resume. Why would a recruiter pick you over a fresh grad with a similar GPA/experience? In the eyes of the company whose goal it is to make money, the recruiter that hires the weaker candidate is doing a poor job. Companies don't want people who do a poor job. \n\nIf you get an MS degree, you'll essentially reset the clock on yourself. Demand for your skills will go up, and you'll have another chance to network with colleagues and companies while in school. You'll also have another chance to work on relevant projects. That 1.5 year gap will become less important. \n\nIf you choose to continue applying to jobs, you need to rework your resume and apply to many more positions. 400 over 1.5 years of unemployment is not nearly enough. While I was averaging ~80 hrs/week on school and clubs, I was still able to get out at least 5 solid apps per week. Without the time commitment of school and other things, you should be going for at least 5 apps per day. Additionally, I say you need to rework your resume because 4 interviews out of 400 apps is really low, and that's primarily resume-dependent. Rework each resume for each position to include keywords, blah blah blah, everyone's heard this a million times, but it's important and makes a difference. \n\nAnyway, after that giant wall of text, I understand your pain. The job market is ruthless for some of us, and the more-fortunate don't seem to understand that sometimes. \n\nGood luck, pal.
>Unless I know something is fact by something other than hearsay, **I'm not putting the man who put me on's wife on blast** in front of thousands (millions counting the net) of people on stage.\n\nTook me a solid 2 minutes to understand this sentence.\n\nAt any rate, kanye didn't "go after" beyonce. If what he claims is true, then fuck beyonce, she deserves to be put on blast. If it's not true, then everyone goes on with their lives. It's not like kanye told everyone something that would irreparably damage beyonce--he actually did the opposite by letting everyone know she's a great person.\n\nAlso, out of curiosity, what is he trying to be a martyr for? If he goes down, what changes?
100% do it. No one at the company will expect you to be an engineering veteran. Just show up ready to listen and learn and you'll be set. 
Thinking about all of the signals I've missed makes me cringe. There's this girl I've been into for a while who gave me oodles of signals when we first met, but I didn't realize they were signals until after we drifted apart. Her cheeks would turn red and she'd laugh really hard at my jokes. One night we were walking to the bus stop, and she kept mentioning that she didn't want to overload on classes because she likes hanging out and partying. I completely missed the obvious opportunity to invite her somewhere. We're both doing our own thing now and I think my chances are 0%, but at least once a week I think about how dumb I was (and still am). The problem is I really only go for nice girls, so I can never tell if they're just being nice or if they're actually interested.
That's what they say. I graduated with a BSME 3.5 weeks ago, and my grandpa was talking shit about me to my sister because I'm not working yet. "Millennials are lazy and don't want to work after they graduate." Alright, gramps, never mind those 80+ hour weeks I've put in for two years straight on top of consistently applying for jobs. Boomers are really trying to manufacture a war on millennials, and it's pretty fucking illogical and annoying. 
Your bank account is very much a part of "playing the game," why do you think they're separate?
Honeycomb isn't as rigid as it looks. They're generally pretty weak in the "perpendicular" (perpendicular to the cells) direction and would provide little resistance to a force in that plane. The deceleration wouldn't be smooth either--the honeycomb would easily compress onto itself and form almost a solid block when it can't compress anymore, then your force is left to deal with the solid chunk of material at the end. 
I'd respond, but I can't make out what you said here.
Yeah I mean why not? What purpose is there to make people waste time right-clicking when there's an available solution? Nostalgia? \n\nRunescape is a 16 year old game. Things are better and more advanced now than they were when the game first came out. There's no reason to continually handicap yourself because you want to live in the past.
When you got the two offers, was it because of something new you did, or did both companies randomly take a liking to what you'd been doing all along?
>no resizeable fullscreen, no "always right click" options\n\nThose are both updates that don't add new content and make the game easier. Being able to move rooms around in your house is an update that makes the game easier. This is not a new concept.
I don't recall ever playing with him, but I could tell something was off with him when I read one of his first lines: "I carry consistently at 4200+." Any self aware person knows that one player can't carry in overwatch.
It's fucked up, but a big part of engineering school is developing a network with your classmates to share your resources. The 4.0 GPA students at my school don't have any special abilities, they just have a solid network of friends willing to help each other. This also bleeds into industry where it's more about who you know rather than what you know.
Yeah, if Lebron had 4 bronze players on his team he wouldn't have won. 
>I completely agree with taxing sugary drinks but hitting diet sodas is really stupid even though I don't drink them now. Tons of people use them to lose weight.\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking this tax is to combat obesity. This tax is for money and money only.
Don't worry about it. Answer A is probably what the writer was going for, but they slightly butchered their approach. 
Oh I 100% agree Elon isn't a good example of trickle down economics. Trickle down is a myth anyway. I was just trying to clear a little bit off Musk's bad reputation when it comes to his engineers.
Sounds about right
>\n    bible belt\n    came up in a hyper-masculine environment (trap)\n    currently operate in a hyper-masculine industry (rap)\n\nI know you're not defending them, but these aren't excuses. If someone is raised a racist and currently operates in the KKK, they're racist. I see people use others' upbringings a lot to give perspective to the way someone acts, but upbringings are of no consequence. They're adults and they make their own decisions.
And I would argue that, to some extent, no one in team sport history has ever won a game by themselves.
I don't understand why this sub has given Dazed as many free passes as they have. I got downvoted to hell once for saying, "isn't Dazed the guy who got caught matchfixing and fucking over his fans?" I'll probably get downvoted for this comment as well. Dazed is a piece-of-shit child at his core, and this sub eats it up.
That's amazing. We are incredible, aren't we? 
He's not even that big of a prick. His opinions really aren't malicious toward anyone, he just claims to be this generation's Einstein. He's cocky/overly confident, and a lot of people just can't handle it.
I started understanding dynamics more after I went to a guest lecture given by Raffaello D'Andrea. I had only been taking the dynamics class for a few months when my professor recommended we go to the lecture. The talk was about pretty complex stuff involving quadrotors, but included in many of the slides were equations that were incredibly similar to the ones I'd learned over the course of a couple months taking dynamics. I realized that these equations I was learning were somehow enough to govern the amazing things that D'Andrea's quadrotors could perform. I began to appreciate how applicable the coursework was to real-world projects. The class didn't seem so bad after that.

>So you havent tried talking to her anymore?\n\nThe only time we see each other is in passing. She always says hi, but it just seems there's no opportunity to stop for a while and talk. Ultimately, it's been so long that whatever feelings she possibly had are gone by now. Mine aren't as strong for her as they used to be, but I'm sure that if we caught up I'd go back to the same level as before.
A lot of people are giving me their definitions of carrying, so I'll give mine: Carrying is doing enough to consistently guarantee the final win. If one player could accomplish that, then I'll concede that he is a carry. But 9/10 times, it's teamwork that guarantees the final win.
Okay Jean-Ralphio lol
I watched a few of his quest guides when I first got back into 2007scape. They were awful. His guides were 2x longer than they could have been simply because he fumbles around every sentence trying to communicate his thoughts. I don't get how anyone could listen to him speak.
Like I said, it's fucked up, but that's just the way it is. Lazy professors who use the same tests are literally asking you to study old tests. It's not against the rules to study old exams for other classes, why should it be against the rules now? It may not be the "honorable" choice, but companies won't care whether you got your degree honorably or not.
Just get an apartment anyway. They're so much better than dorms.
What does it look like to a recruiter if I take a semester away from engineering after graduation? I'm graduating this December, and after having no luck with more than 250 internship and full time applications, I'm completely and absolutely burned out. I've lived in the same place and haven't gone anywhere for 22 years, so I'm thinking of travelling and living some life for once. I figure I'd take a month or two to clear my head before getting back into the application grind, but it may take longer. How long after graduation do candidates become entirely undesirable? 
This was Hillary's argument against free college tuition. I still cant believe people took her side over Bernie's in the primaries.
I agree Elon isn't the superhero that most people make him out to be, but it's not entirely his fault. The demand to work for SpaceX and Tesla exceeds the supply so much so that they will always find a person who will work longer hours for less. Where engineers lack pay, they receive invaluable experience that can be used to launch their careers in any direction they want.
Elliott Morgan has an interesting point about this [here.](https://youtu.be/8BBak30oHOs?t=38) I linked directly to the point, but the whole video is worth a watch. He calls the Trump win in March of last year.\n\nWhat he essentially says is Trump himself will always be more interesting and entertaining than anything anyone else says about Trump. Donald has a talent for making people want to see more of him because **he's not boring**. Enough people decided that they would rather have an entertaining president than a robot.
I applied before the priority deadline and got in in February, but they made it clear that we were the first batch of people accepted and there would be more people admitted later. So, it depends. 
It's not that he doesn't give a shit about what he looks like, it's that he doesn't give a shit about what *you think* he looks like. He's extremely secure about himself in all his interviews and just does what he likes.
Top notch meme
It says a lot about the Grammys when so many award winners say "someone else should have won this." Hopefully people start to realize the Grammys are a joke.
Are you sure it's not dynamic pressure/velocity? Velocity is low (zero) at stagnation points, so dynamic pressure on the front of the cow would be lower than something downstream. The flow speeds up as it moves along the cow's camber which explains the red patches on its head and legs. The blue patches could indicate flow separation where the velocity has dropped a lot.
How often should you contact a company after your final interview for an entry-level job? I'd imagine there's a fine line between staying on their radar and becoming annoying, so I'm curious to know if you should just send the one thank-you email and let them do their thing or if you should keep emailing to show your interest. People are saying that you really need to work the job hunt for your first job, and leaving a company alone while they're making their decision seems to go against that mentality. 
>There's a light argument this effects lower income families the most that use these products for a cheap source of calories and caffeine.\n\nI'm bummed out by this tax because it absolutely effects low income families the most. I grew up without much money so food was always scarce in the house. Drinking 1-2 cans of coke throughout the day was a lifesaver in terms of providing me with energy and keeping the hunger pains away for a while. \n\nAnd before anyone claims this causes obesity, I was underweight growing up and I'm 6'1", 155 lbs today. It turns out that **you still need to eat unhealthy food along with your sugary drinks to become obese.**
This has made me consider things I haven't before, thanks. 
Alright dude if you're tapping out I can't stop you.

It's not the modem. I've run all the tests. Packet loss is rampant. My last tech to come out, I watched his tests and saw all the packet loss. His test unit was plugged directly into the coax cable from the wall, no modem involved and the packet loss was constant.

We had a high Filipino population back in Richmond VA, many Catholic, so our Catholic church had quite a few. Ethnic Festivals were really popular as well, name an ethnicity and we had a festival, except Filipino, until my dad organized the Filipino festival at our church (we're of French and German ancestry). It was a huge success and I think they are going on their 12th year? On my dads last year helping and passing organization down, he was given an award presented by none other than Hilldawgs running mate, Tim Kaine. My dad got to sit with Tim for a good two hours dumping his conservative beliefs on Tim. I felt so shitty when Tim was announced, he's actually a decent guy.\n\nThe point of this comment though is that Filipinos are fucking awesome, great people.
Was listening to NPR today and they were talking about an illegal immigrant, or "immigrant without proper documentation" as they put it being deported after living here for 20 years. Excuse me, but I think she owes 20 years in taxes.
I've been a fan of him for a long, long time. And this coming from someone who never watched his videos. I enjoy his stuff now because he's a no fucks given, honest, shitlord now. I've been a fan because he's a genius. I'm a fan of capitalism and he's yet another example of putting the work in and being rewarded and *earning* your place.
The Russians win again.
How does that compare to any other time frame? I'm interested to know just how big that number is.
Omg that corner between Suramar, Highmountain and Stormheim has always bothered the fuck out me.
While there is money made, it's scarce and complicated. Some players make money being streamers which is all personal and very few actually make a full time living out of it. Method is probably the best monetized operation, they have teams and players in many different games, so they have sponsors and merchandise, but I can't think of any other guild with that large of an organization. As far as I'm aware, a vast majority of players from these insane top guilds just have sweet deals with their full time jobs where they take a month or two off for these big world first races.
Until Ivanka, 16!
Go watch the way secret service act in crowds with former and current presidents. They are in 100% hyper focus mode. Zero distraction allowed. In most cases you can watch them scanning rooms, watching all slightest movements of everyone, especially their hands, ready at any second to act. Their training is nuts.

The only definition of anarcho posadism I can find is some rambling about it being a theory that alien civilizations came to earth and you hope they would share their advanced version of socialism. What is it?
American Football player. In the NFL. Green Bay Packers are a very popular team. His name is Blake Martinez. He makes quite a lot of money and is still pretty low on the totem pole of pay. http://overthecap.com/player/blake-martinez/4844/\n\nHe's a defensive lineman. This past season was his rookie year. He played for Stanford in college.\n\nHe came on the stream to talk about real sports vs esports. Talking about the culture moving towards accepting esports. The NBA (basketball) seems to be the one real sport really starting to put money into esports and we could other sports like Football getting in the mix.
They're pro establishment. Romney was the same ole globalist shit. Bernie, Trump, they threaten the establishment, Trump was just able to beat the establishment.

All about how well you baby a car in its first 100k miles.
I don't understand the hatred for working with Trump. He's the fucking president whether you like it or not. If he invites you to the table for discussion and you don't agree with him, the worst thing you can do is not show up to voice your opposing views. Whar the fuck is wrong with these people.
I've just got to say I would put Joe on the extremely short list of high profile media liberals who actually saw what was fucking happening. He did a whole bit about talking to his Trump supporting friends and family to burst the liberal bubble.
Yea, how dare they try to cover server costs!

I am using their supplied router/modem which I admit I should replace with my own. I have, however, spent the last 3 weeks pain stakingly testing, researching and spending hours on the phone with Comcast. It is 100% not my router. See some of my other comments here for more.
I see what you mean. I don't though think it is package injection that I'm experiencing unless they've just gone overboard mad with it in increasing intesity over the past 3 weeks, which doesn't seem right. However, I could see a VPN improving my connection if it were to take a different route hop away from their shitty infrastructure. But that could also only improve my packet loss issue while still increasing my ping. I'll have to look into it. Either way, I would enjoy Comcast actually fixing their fucking shit haha.
I see your FoST2!

I'll say it again. Everyone go watch some Pewds. He's trolling the media in every video now. He's become a master shitlord. Definitely not the Pewds you are probably thinking he is.
My german professor in college would basically have story time once a week. Sounds so childish, but it was cool. He'd tell stories about crazy shit in Europe. One day he flipped the script and said who's got a story. He looked at me almost immediately and said I can see it in your eyes, tell the story. My story was about when my friends and I tried to brew Vodka in high school haha.
And Sargon continues to get higher profile youtubers on his livestreams. Youtubers that I thought were blindly following the narrative and wouldn't ever speak to someone like Sargon. This is truely the best timeline god has ever created. And I'm an athiest.
According to their site he is actually on the panel, not a mini guest.\n\nEdit: god dammit I was wrong. They barely let him speak. Bill Maher was just barely not coward enough to let him on a show but enough of a coward to not give him a chance and very particularly steer the conversation.
He was just barely enough of a virtue signaling liberal to let Milo on, just so he could cut him off as quick as he could. Maher is about as far off the deep end of liberalism. He was trying to signal he's not a coward. He is in fact a coward.
So then you have that as your name ironically or do you actually subscribe to that?

I feel a pattern here. Same boat here. Are these girls living out the song so they can have their own Jesse Lacey who feels that way about them?
The guy who owned the office building we were in owned one as well as a ridiculous Porsche, Ferrari and a BMW i8. He would park his P1 on the top deck just under a overhang so the back of it would poke out and get rained on and such. It would just sit there for weeks and his exhaust pipes started to rust out. Imagine being so rich that your fucking P1's exhaust pipes start rusting out and you don't give a fuck.
I don't know if I've even seen one of these in person, let alone at this level of perfection. God damn, beautiful.
He, as well as every other moron there, could have left and not had some moron hit them with their moron heels.
Then why is every example of communism enforced with authoritarianism? Oh right, because it wasn't a perfect example of communism. I wonder why that is? Oh, it's due to human nature that makes it impossible to enforce your oppression of the masses without force to make them "equal".

Something to note is the context or subject involved. I'm a web developer and dabble in many other things like mods and addons for games. When I'm searching for something related to Kafka data ingest, I can search with professional terminology. When I'm searching things related to addon development for WoW, I can use a more relaxed but informed terminology. Then there's Minecraft modding. You have to put yourself in the shoes of a young teen. The more accurate the terminology, the less you will find.
The Constitution applies to citizens right?
Find one single example from all of human history where a society wasn't hierarchical. I guarentee you can't find one. The closest ideology I know of was communism. The funny thing is, all it did was take the overwhelming majority and oppress them into crippling poverty to the benefit of the extreme minority of those at the top. Capitalism is by far the most successful social system in the history of humanity to spread prosperity. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws, but without removing human natures flaws from our species, you won't accomplish a better system. I'd like to keep my flawed human nature and individuality if you don't mind.
The time I got pulled (and not ticketed) for reckless was when I raced a Ford Probe off the line. Good times.

I've already gone through all of the steps. It's not the router/modem. It's not the wires in my wall. It's not the connection on my building. I don't know past that. I've already had two in home techs, scheduled my third, and a "line tech" who fixes stuff outside homes/buildings come out and "fix it". They already gave me a credit to my account because they think they fixed it.
Practice of trust and perfection of unified movement. Unspoken coordination. It's like meditation.
Am I too honest? Is this why my relationships seem to go to shit haha?
Here's how I explain the 1% to these types. All it takes to be the 1% in America is to make 400k or more. When they say the 1%, what they actually mean is the 1% of the 1%. And what they don't realize is just how much money they don't have in the grand scheme of things. Take every single penny from every single 1% of the 1% and you've paid for maybe 6 months of one year of government spending. They overestimate their worth by huge orders of magnitude because they just don't have a concept of money and economics.
You mean they were discovered to be illegal immigrants after being pulled for simple traffic infractions? They broke the law. I'm sorry

Yeah. I drive and religiously maintain a 1999 with 260k miles running. I feel it's pretty anticonsumerist to do something like that. I hope to get it to 500k miles so that ever ounce of metal was used out of respect and conservation.\n\nNo, i cannot survive without a car and I can't afford to live in/move to most cities, especially those with reliable public transport.
So you don't support protesting. That's fine. It's not everyone's bag.\n\nPeople hated black protesters who did sit-ins. People hated OWS. Their disruptions caused news and awareness and so did the anger of those inconvenienced. Its just how protesting works.
It depends on how you go about analyzing sociological problems. You can blame the individual or the system. Individuals become a summation of their experiences; you became anti-racist as a result of your experiences, many of them became racist as a basis of theirs. \n\nYou cling to your beliefs too and are so sure they are right, right? Think about how sure you are about these beliefs. Did you suddenly "choose" one day not to be racist? I doubt it. Yet you suggest that "Trump-minded people and southerners" DID make a choice? Come on! Think about it!\n\nRacism is not a disease, it's a symptom. It's a symptom of an illusion created specifically to divide for the profit of the .1%. It has been since the 1600s in America.

I am also a NH resident, and few things about this state make me hate the man more than our ridiculous state inspection system. It's all in some convoluted effort to keep emissions in check, but all it does is force people to toss otherwise good cars when realistically the manufacture of a new car is one of the worst consumer products on the environment. \n\nAs someone who finds the act of keeping a 1999 with 270k miles running my little contribution to anti-consumerism, every birth month is tainted by my inevitable trip to get my car inspected. Thank god I have a mechanic who will drive around with the computer to get it to pass. 
Iran. Hundreds of years of playing civilization way ahead in culture, science, etc. Huge travel destination for people all over the world. Ideologically was very similar to the US/Europe during midcentury. They elect a populist (essentially a socialist) who is assassinated, then replaced by a pro-US, pro-corporate dictator put in power by the CIA. Country revolts and puts in power a theocratic dictatorship not because they really wanted to but because they were the only party willing to stand up to the US and big oil. Now most Americans ball up Iran with the worst of the worst. \n\nIt actually hurts a little to sum up this particular country's history in so few sentences.
I teach college level writing and public speaking. In school I studied a lot of rhetoric and naturally we did a lot of rhetorical analysis which is essentially what nerdwriter is doing here. \n\nThe benefit of this sort of analysis may not be all that suited for a viewing audience but more for the analyzer. As an activity for my students, it expands critical thinking especially in regards to beginning to think about how individual words function as a greater whole and also in the context in which they are spoken. Sure, it is kind of intellectual masturbation, but I think it is a valuable exercise for people to think about communication more critically, especially in a larger social context. \n\nThere are competing theories with which how to analyze something like Louis CK. A popular approach in literature studies is "Death of the Author" which argues that the author's (Louis CK's) intent means nothing; instead, only the audience's interpretation is what defines the work. There is the formalist approach too, which merely analyzes grammatical formality free of annoying things like context. I like the rhetorical approach for my courses though just because I find it empowering to the author. \n\nI know everything I said above is a bit of a jumble, but if you have one positive takeaway from this video and the analytical approach to language in general is this: I think analyzing and having intent behind your langugae and communication is more important now than ever. As a best_of post about modern propaganda explain, language and meaning is being used very effectively to divide us. You see it all the time, especially in this current "war on facts." Is a populace facing this grave context better suited with critical thinking activities that ask them to think about the communication they and others use? I think so. 
I know this is going to sound like pretentious bullshit, but maybe you've spent so long trying to be someone you're not that you don't know how to be yourself anymore. \n\nI would also say that INTPs are so emotionally infantile well into their 20s that perhaps you just haven't grown into yourself yet. As someone who teaches 18 year olds and keeps in touch with a lot of them, I can attest that as people hit their late 20s, people see through bullshit a lot more and seek something more genuine. Unfortunately, you may be fine tuning an art (faking being something your not) right at an age where that strategy is beginning to become obsolete in your age bracket. \n\nI can say that in my experience, the trysts and affairs before the age of 25 were generally very chaotic. I fell in love/infatuation way too hard and never really knew how to deal with it. At the time, I just figured that was "me" and that people just didn't like it. But I also realized that I had great friends (although only a handful of really close ones) but never great connections with women. Then I analyzed my behavior around both and it finally clicked; the person I *was* around my friends was attractive, the person I *tried* to be around potential suitors was unattractive. \n\nThe reason for the other questions is that I think a quiet confidence (and, for lack of a better term, "not caring") came when i finally got a good job (I teach university). Although I didn't know it at the time, I logically concluded I wasn't "a real man" because I hadn't accomplished anything. As soon as that part of my "life goals" was taken care of, the interested women came flooding in. It was overwhelming. With every possible suitor and relationship of varying length, I slowly came to conclude that I was actually desirable to women who had grown up at a similar pace I had. And it wasn't simply they liked me for my job; my job made me feel actually desirable and thus made me desirable to others. \n\nI really am trying to check the ego here, as I still have some self-consciousness about "who I am" and my desirability to women, but the few long (and many of the short) relationships I have had since I was 25, many have let me know that this self-consciousness is ridiculous. I am overweight and not the most active of dudes. Sometimes I am intense intellectually and emotionally. But in the end I can still connect very genuinely with women. 
Protests are supposed to be disrupting. Otherwise, who would give a shit?
What's your specific field and what did you do in industry?
I know it's not the most poignant of points, but libertarianism really was proved ridiculous when a college friend in political science asked me "so beaherobeaman, why do you think there are no black libertarians?"\n\nThe question really drove me down a trail of contemplation I had never really considered, When I couldn't come up with an answer or justification that wasn't racist, I knew it was bullshit.
Was the indication it was from california from a mark.tag in the wood or in the springs or in the upholstery?\n\nFrankly, before I read your comments I was thinking custom/homemade as well.  
There's a lot of difference between following a particular worldview (a reality largely based on experience, emotions and logic) than having the physical capabilities of being a pro-NBA player.\n\nFor the "no straight white men are fashion designers," I wonder why that is? Is it cultural? \n\nI agree, black communities have historically been very religious and conservative. That said, modern American libertarianism has little preference for religion and are actually socially "liberal". So I am not sure what you're trying to prove in your second point. 
1) how old are you?\n\n2) what do you do for a living?\n\n3) have you accomplished anything of universally appreciated value?\n\n4) what do you like doing as hobbies activities?\n\nI have an inkling how to respond to you, but need these answers first. One thing I can respond to for sure is that as soon as Carnegie and PUA stuff are used as a tool as opposed to an internal philosophical adjustment, they never work. \n\nThink of learning a new language by truly understanding that language vs learning a language by translating every word back to English. The latter never works. 
After dating, being, living with and having family members who are INTPs, INTPs are the most likely to think they are okay with possibly being wrong, but in the actual moment are the most offended when their opinions/beliefs are challenged.
I suspect most of the response you get in here is going to be along the lines of "change nothing." If you want to remain strict with the MCM design aesthetic, then refresh wood and do little things. \n\nI am going to guess this was built in the late 70s? Early 80s? The board and batten and the indoor tree screams 70s/80s contemporary. I am basing that off New England standards though, so I clearly could be wrong. If so, it's note strictly an MCM home. I am not complaining, the house os gorgeous and certainly very unique. \n\nIt's a little hard to tell from just these photos, but if you are open to other ideas....\n\nI think the kitchen would be a great place to start. Frankly, I think stainless steel appliances are a good marriage with your kitchen and the MCM style. Clean, muted. I am not dogmatic in suggesting stainless for every house mind you, but I think it would fit there. \n\nThe counter is tough. Part of everyone wants to keep that shocking green. The other part is like "formica is gross." I am definitely in the latter camp. I think granite is a bit played out and makes everything look like contractor grade. I would suggest concrete countertops with a dark tint. Or slate. If you really want a big pop again, just not the green, I really like copper as well. \n\nThe back of that "floating" upper cabinet is pretty gross. I personally would tear the whole thing off because who needs that much cabinet space. If you want to freshen up all the cabinets, you could replace just the cabinet doors with something cleaner like teak. Also replace the pulls with something deco. \n\nNotes about the rest:\n\nI am always 50/50 on the paneling. Sometimes it's what "makes" a MCM home; sometimes the dogma of sticking to a style gets in the way have pure natural aesthetics. Paneling can look great and it can look bad, but IMO it always looks a little cheap. You have so much exposed natural wood anyway, that you could get away with sheetrock painted a light color and it would accent the wood, the fireplace. \n\nI have known 1 person who had and remodeled 2 contemporary homes with indoor trees. It's neat. But both remodels asked to remove the tree and the person I know who has is says it's pretty annoying. \n\nMy 2 cents
This sub is the worst circlejerk on reddit, and that's saying something. No discussion is allowed besides a very specific perspective. Argue or present alternative ideas, even with evidence, you're banned. It self describes itself as a "safe space."\n\nI was banned for arguing that jealousy of wealth *exists* in America. I wish I was kidding.\n\nIt's great for shitty memes and things taken out of context and everyone agreeing with each other.  Horrible for discussion beyond a college freshman who just read some Zizek.
The best thing you can for yourself and your country is reach out. Fight poverty in real and tangible ways. Show them that you are there to help, despite what opinions or notions they may have. As they see you, a west coast liberal showing care and understanding, they will begin to understand you as well. Maybe I am dreaming on an optimistic island, but I hope that that understanding each other will lead to unity. Where they have their jobs taken away with no opportunity to pull themselves out, you have a 7% interest student loan payment and 50k in student loan debt. Both of these are examples where the system has failed you both. You have more in common with a Trump voter in Missouri than you do with the .1% keeping you both hating each other. 
The end game is to allow Trump/ to self-destruct and get an unelected Paul Ryan (workable) or Tillerson (ideally, in the elite'$ mind) as president or at least de facto president. Ryan is third in succession. Tillerson is 4th. And everyone so sick of Trump will applaud the new leaders. Brilliant work.\n\nDon't let the Trump tyranny narrative fool you. He no longer serves any purpose. He was elected and he got specific people confirmed. His role is over.  
Haha it's shaped like a dick. No pun intended.
Do the joints pictured create any problems of function? Or is it just ugly to you? \n\nI am not arguing; I am curious and don't know much about masonry/bricklaying. If it creates actual problems, the whole "last for generations" argument above is a bit moot. If it doesn't, then the point above still lays true. 
Seriously, this is fascinating. Great post. 
Me and my two intp friends (one female, one male) all have a great time dating. Tinder, okc, in person, anything. We've all definitely broken more hearts than had our hearts broken. I don't feel great about that or anything, but it's the truth.\n\nIt's not your personality type; it's your personality. Blaming your type and society for your perceived victimization might be a good place to begin change.      
It looks like the silhouette of a Scottie dog.\n\nAnd Africa looks like E.T.
Very slippery slope.
On the first point, I completely agree. Although there is a debate among historians, Michelle Alexander makes the argument in *The New Jim Crow* that "race" was essentially invented by the wealthy planter elite in late 1600s America to curb any chance of the lower classes unifying. It was essentially invented. \n\nBut the grander point is that political factions have always existed in the US. Whether it was the rich governors appointed by England or the founding fathers of Whigs or Republicans or whatever. But they are the tool, not the one who wields it. The wielder has always been the rich elite. Sure, I was giving it modern context in my comment, but the machine works in the same way with the same philosophical rule; maintain "differences" in people so they never unify. \n\nAnd I'm sorry if you got the impression that I am suggesting "stop talking about race." I really didn't mean that. But I think a better way to frame the discussion is about race as an invented tool to divide people rather than a "real" thing. Wealth inequality transcends race.
I repeat, I was banned for arguing that wealth envy exists. Exists. That level of safe space sheltering isn't healthy for anyone. 
Why is this a racist question?
I'm about halfway through my degree right now but summer is coming up so I wanted to help out some way. I just signed up to volunteer at the local VA hospital, if that doesn't work out I'll try the homeless shelter near me 
What camera/lens ? 
They aren't (all) mad that we are equal. Imagine being a poor white person and all politicians, cultural media and activists are talking about is poor minorities. I fully understand that whites have an inherent advantage in the United States, but try *really* accepting that when your life sucks too. You hear educated, affluent whites call you a racist and call you privileged while you and your community are struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThen you start thinking "why don't those people care about me too? I'm struggling too. My kids are hungry and my job is forever gone. Why are they just talking about black people?" Soon enough, groups of people down on their luck start hearing the same from other poor whites and they bond by race. Not only are they not getting opportunities as a result of policies, technological advancement, whatever, but even the people who supposedly want to help the vulnerable focus on minorities in their rhetoric. All the while calling or insinuating that you're racist because you demand empowerment when others rank higher than you on some fantasy "needs empowerment" scale. When you're that low on Maslow's heirarchy, scratching for appreciation and security and barely a home and food, you will seek anything you can to empower yourself. Unfortunately, all that is being offered to these people is hatred. \n\nAnd it's opinions like this that contribute to that. How much did we loathe George Bush for summarizing the entirity of unrest in Muslim nations as "people who hate freedom." But summarizing poor people who want more who happen to be white as "hating equality" is completely acceptable?\n\nEDIT: There is one thing that unifies us all: wealth inequality. That is where the 99% is truly equal regardless of who you supported in this election. Regardless of your party. Regardless of your race. While we bicker endlessly about who's life sucks more, the profit flows as we are being divided. That capital is then parlayed into dividing people further.\n\nThe .1% doesn't care about race past it being the most effective tool in securing more wealth and power. The .1% doesn't care about LGBT marriages or shared bathrooms besides it being a tool that divides the 99%.\n\nIt is not a mistake that the country is essentially divided 50/50. The parties, designed by the .1%, have have moved away from ideology and instead moved issues on either side of the balance beam so that unity is nearly impossible. While we fight for the scraps, the rich are taking bets, drunk and throwing half-eaten turkey legs over their shoulders.
I'll add a Star Mako3 to everyone else's responses (particularly Leopards and Aviars). The Mako3 was my saving grace when I first started. 
I don't think it necessarily means that. I think that people in general want their government (and thus the system) and people in general to care about them. Being "conned" into someone like Trump is a symptom of them not getting that care and that help. Like another comment articulated, people can get so desperste that they vote against their own interests. 
It's not an argument at all. It's a rhetorical question meant to do what rhetorical questions do; inspire thought. The point of it is to analyze why there are so few of one particular race/group and thus social reality **do not** subscribe to that ideology. That then opens up a new avenue of thought; why are libertarians largely white?  \n\nIf the fallacy you're claiming is hasty generalization because of the word "any", then your response is an example of a straw man. So we could go back and forth claiming fallacies or you can just pretend that "any" basically means "very few" in casual conversation and debate from there. 
That work?
Wow. I thought I was the only one. \n\nI remember my stepfather asking me in an existential sense, "are you happy beaherobeaman" and I stuttered because I barely understood the question anymore. I just told him "my happiness isn't really all that important to me." He was really confused.\n\nThe way I describe it now is this: imagine all the ebbs and flows of unhappiness/happiness worked on a scale from -10 to +10. I'm almost always about a -2. Sometimes a point or two higher, sometimes a point or two lower. But most of the time a pretty consistent -2. Basically a mild downer but pretty lucid, steady and realistic. 
As I said, im pretty steady. \n\nIt does me a lot of favors with friends, students (I'm a teacher), and colleagues. It's great in relationships early and when partners are in a rough patch. It's really bad when partners are doing good/great or are trying really hard in the relationship. Most partners say they want someone really stable but eventually find it boring. \n\n
42 is the model/design, not the year. 
Memes and social media are the worst pacifiers.\n\nPlease let me know if you find the community you describe. That's what I want too. 
I'm right here. \n\nAnd yes, this was tough to skim through
My comment is less about Trump and more about us all falling for a headline implying something it can't/doesn't prove for views and profit. Especially when so many criticize the exact same thing on the other side. 
It's disgusting yes, but am I the only one who would love cleaning it? Imagine how satisfying the before and after would be!
Ok then, they say it directed at all Trump voters. Same difference. They are taking 63 million people and calling them racists. \n\nYou can't expect everyone to be as informed and skeptical as you or I. I don't know who you are at all, but if you're anything like most active anti-Trump people I know, you're probably pretty well informed. But the information you and I consume is just as likely to be dogmatic as those in which we are analyzing. The point is that you know things that people in poor minorities just don't know or think, but you're making judgments based on their decision as if they know everything you know. \n\nThere is this amazing episode of This American Life called "Trends with Benefits" where they look deeply into the disability benefits system in the US. In this one part, they ask this woman on disability for back problems what her dream job would be. She answered "the person at the disability office that weeds people out and determines if they get disability."\n\nThe reporter, Chana Jofee-Walt, originally thought that the person wanted that job because she had experience with the disability system and thought she would be good at determining who was faking it. Later, when Jofee-Walt asked her for clarification, the woman explained that it was the only job she could think of that involved sitting. Think about that. The only job a person could think of that involved not standing all day, in 2015, was the person at the disability office. \n\nAlthough anecdotal, this is a really telling example that isn't difficult to extrapolate across **any** group of people. You deride the person who wants their coal job back when that is all they have ever known. Sure, they know others jobs must exist, but would a person in Ohio every think they could be a lobster fisherman? Or a person working in a fashion house in NYC think they could, if they wanted, be a surveyor? \n\nEDIT: And yes, you can say "well, people offered to teach them!" But like other jobs, many of these people never did well in school either. Or they have'nt been it for so long that they literally can't imagine doing it. You could go further and say "well, sometimes you just need to change," but isn't anyone, regardless of social/economic class resistant to forced change?
That's why I like Tumblr girls lol.
The article conveniently leaves out that this behavior is typical of any politician. \n\nWe, nor the authors of this story know the charity or the amount. But this isn't a story yet. It's simply pandering to peoples' hatred, fears and assumptions. Intentionally. For profit. In the face of journalistic responsibility. We love to deride fake news and Fox News and breitbart, but when it panders to what we want to think, we hump at it like a bitch in heat.\n\n Imagine this earns $10 million for the WWF. Great. Using power to garner charitable donations NOT under personal control. But will this website go back and apologize for this 100 word article?\n\nIt's a story when this as whole who paid for a $500k hunting trip suddenly has the lawsuit against him dismissed. Or gets a government contract.     
A Hemingray 42 in aqua is probably the most common insulator. It does look pretty complete though, so 2-4 dollars.\n\nIt could have some subtle "error" or variant that makes it worth a little more. For example, I have an insulator that says "HEMINGAY" instead of "HEMINGRAY"
Solved!
When did they flee? \n\nBecause in my studies, the US and the UK are either directly or indirectly responsible for a large amount of that brutality by exercising espinage and coups.
Serious question...are longer messages ever okay?
We've done alright without a top a WR, I think. Especially without one with an attitude problem.
I used to work at Smoke N' Barley in Tilton. We always had it. 
It's called post-modernism. 
Regardless of how I feel about the claims of either of you, this is a great back and forth. 
I don't disagree with you at all. I think, at least in their rhetoric, some Democrats have tried to say/prove that they are for the underprivileged in general. But you cannot also deny that the popular left (meaning the masses of liberals, not the politicians) have latched onto rather aggressive words/phrasing such as racist, homophobe, patriarch, chauvinist, misogynist, etc to attack lower class whites. It puts everyone in a defensive position. \n\nAnd both sides are guilty of following a narrative. How many so-called liberals ball up the entire class of poor whites as racists with privilege, stuck dreaming about antiquated jobs that destroy the environment? That too fits a narrative that justifies what cannot be justified by the educated and affluent on the left.

And I don't understand people who are dogmatic about anything, let alone homes. Just because I own a house that's from the 19th century doesn't mean I'm going to deal with a claw foot tub or not have a garage that fits a car. There's plenty of good, as I mentioned. And every change I made is meant in the spirit of complimenting the house, not changing it into,something else.\n\n
As if he didn't already make me self-conscious about my manhood, he has to be funny too. 
I think the knowledge and critique of overconsumption is rising in my group of friends, but that wisdom does not really amount to anything substantial. Most of them are buying insanely large houses (3000 sqft+) and they need to decorate it with something.\n\nI think the "anti-clutter'' thing is going strong, but the larger pictures is as bad as ever.
I think your edit is the most important point. Frankly, it shouldn't matter to anyone which "race" has more poverty. It's poverty and race is just an illusion manufactured to divide. 
None of the links from your homepage work besides to this house. 
I mean, nice wordplay and everything, but I still have no idea what you disagree with
Sounds like another INTP who is logically justifying not leaving their computer chair. Very original. 
This is the comment that gets "fucking reddit sometimes"?
I would like to know more
Nah. Not really. 
Oh great. Another story for the "political correctness is killing America" crowd to circlejerk about. Exactly what we need. 
Was probably referring to decor and furnishings?
I would totally store all my gold chains and large sunglasses in this.
Wait? Are we talking about wars or something?
When's the last time you've been to Dover?
Sorry the smaller picture is so poor, but there isn't really anything complex about the logo to need a super-quality picture. \n\nThis shirt was found in a bunch of 80s band t-shirts I found when picking a house in Exeter, New Hampshire. Shirt feels as if it's a cotton/poly blend. 
It takes years to trust someone. I'm 31. The only people I am completely myself around are my friends from HS and college and my mother, sister and father. \n\nIt helps explain, at least to me, why we are so difficult to date but so easy to fall for. I've dated 3 INTPs (women) and am an INTP myself, so I observe it from both sides. My latest girlfriend and I were together for 10 months and she only opened up in very controlled quantities. Essentially, it's a real achievement to get us to open up at all, so those who do get some of an INTPs inner self feel special in a very genuine way. But inevidatbly, people can't handle the glacial pace in which we expose vulnerability.\n\nOddly enough, I've found INTPs are also turned off by guarded people, yet we are guarded ourselves. 
I'm new to using kratom and new to this community, so please don't downvote me to hell. This is meant to be a real question/critique.\n\nBut since being here, there seems to be this kiddish excitement for what is essentially a drug/medication. It just seems wrong to be so excited about it like its a toy, especially as people are trying to make it illegal.\n\nSorry to be a party pooper, I just don't get it.
It's less about American coal, more about Russian coal/oil. I think this is a major step to try an neuter some of the latest chess moves unleashed by Putin/Russia. 
Honestly, INTPs are better in the Steve Bannon role. Not the politics, just the role.
The problem is poor people voting. The solution is making them convicts so those poor people can't vote. 
If there was another way to know, that would be *the* way to know.\n\nBe patient.

I promise this is not meant to be condescending in any way, but did you just finish your first term of college? Just because you say you're 18 and its December.
Great, informative karma execution. Bravo

Wait. So this is the same "Mortgage Specialists" in front of Target in Somersworth that now looks defunct?
Because a video produced [by a group heralded as Islamophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Islamization_of_America) of a handful of cherrypicked interviews without context of the questions, hosted by a shock-and-awe blowhard does not belong on a subreddit about higher education. \n\nThe only thing this has to do with "higher education" is that the source claims these are Columbia students. And that's before the very legitimate concerns/critiques about the source itself. This video actually hurts whatever progress you might make because it associates a very real issue with lowest-common denominator shock tactics and is represented by a hate group. Not to mention it is posted by someone who apparently spends an incredible amount of time posting a single-narrative hatred towards a religious group. You've chosen the wrong group to target in here. Take this shit to /r/the_donald.\n\nIt's content like this that is the problem with intellect in the United States. 
Whole lot of people logically justifying just sitting in their ass in here. This is political "revolution", right?
Everyone is giving these super complicated answers. I think it's really that he had mentally committed to plans and didn't deal with a sudden, spontaneous change to them. \n\nAlso, all of the INTJs I have ever known, both male and female, are fiercely independent and generally build an expectation of never really needing anyone. \n\nI am not standing up for him. Clearly he should've been more supportive, but did you make it clear that that is what you wanted? Or was it all just hints, even super clear ones?
Maybe he's a troll too. The endless cycle of deceit
I rely less on the "sick of minorities being propped up" and more on "sick of being ignored and looking for anything where they can find empowerment." I think there is a stark difference. The former is a symptom of the latter as people struggle for any kind of empowerment. 
But that argument could be used in any situation. Block a road? People are going to work. Protest outside in the quad? You're blocking people going to class. 
Remindme! 3 weeks
So it's a smith corona. Didn't know it had such a streamlined case
I did list "politicians, cultural media and activists" to widen the argument beyond just politicians. \n\nThe main thing where I *think* we disagree is essentially a "chicken or the egg" argument. Which came first, racism or politicians catering to it? In my opinion and with some of the points I have made in other comments in this thread, racism was manufactured in the late 1600s as a way to divide lower classes. The elite, including "far right politicians," "dangle anti-minority legislation" as a way to continue racism as much as it caters to it. \n\nMy main argument overall was that assuming that all Trump supporters/voters are racist is a fatal mistake for any kind of movement because it maintains division. Very few, if any, people know that that s what they are doing, but they are. 
What else could you do?

Yea sciatica is the only thing but I had an MRI and they said I didn't have any disc problems just a weak core from cycling and running. I went to PT and have been trying to get better at working my core but lately it's been flaring up might have to do PT again 
Oh didn't know that would be important I'm in Massachusetts 
Still down for me also EST on Xbox
Wow no kidding? I'll keep trying, I have had a few dates from OKC in the past few months just gets frustrating 
Finally got a message from the girl I had my eye on, you're telling me!
Just when I finally got a message from the girl I was really interested in \n\nWHY UNIVERSE 
Where do you go that you need to do this?
I'm totally with you! Just add driving a manual in there. I hate when I have to bring my car to the shop, even the day or two without it I feel empty or like something is missing. Sometimes the automatic rental just doesn't make the cut I need a manual 
The only NASCAR merch I have is a black baseball hat that has the NASCAR logo on it I wear while working on my car. It has been so far the most and only toned down NASCAR merch I've ever seen 
Thank you! :) 
Haha that's me! \n\nI kind of know who I am, but I'm still definitely figure it out\n\nI have a lovely tea shop operated by all females that I just found so that's good. You're right though \n\nHahaha that's the best thing I've ever heard <3 the Miata is definitely a people pleaser 
I get pretty crap gas mileage since I put on the exhaust though wouldn't that help with that?
Haha that gave me a good laugh thanks for that 
1. 8am \n\n2. No but if I do decaf\n\n3. Love the salty ones you get with burgers. Sweet pickles are nasty \n\n4. Get gas and maybe take some pictures if it's nice out \n\n5. If a woodchuck chucks wood buck no one is around to see it did it chuck any wood?
I'd wager to say so haha have some drinks see what happens, they usually help me too when I go out :D
Funny enough I just watched a Yogi give that same advise on YouTube 
Well by a glass I mean like [this much](http://ocean.happeningmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/glass-of-wine-2.jpeg) I've been told I pour them less than others haha \n\nBut yea you're probably right otherwise 
Welcome man! 
Were did you pick those up? I'd like to add them to my car emergency kit 
I did a while ago seemed to be just tech and sporting meetups but I will check again 
But so is Seinfeld and I understand that haha no I got that part of it but a lot of it just seems like information I don't really get/need 
Any chance it's just anxiety? Happens to me with these sort of things. I'm sure you'll be fine and if you do spew, well it's a club I'm sure they've seen it before. \n\nHave fun! 
Thank you! And yea it's a good motivator. My therapist actually recommended that to me (though he suggested something more healthy than cigars haha) 
Awe that's awesome thanks for updating me!! :) 
People who DDOS are truly awful people 
Well anxiety mimics a heart condition, and that's how I found out I had it. Has your doctor not brought up anxiety is the cause? You seem to discuss the what ifs with your roomates, why not go see the college mental health counselor and vent to her instead? Might help 
Darn I could have sworn she told me about candy she likes but for the life of me I can't remember what it was 
$698 final offer 
Don't worry about it not being factory fresh, it's got character? 
It was actually a rooibos I went back and looked after posting this 
Say stuff like "I'm here for you" and "you're ok, it will pass" those help a lot with anxiety/panic attacks. Also just being there and not saying much can really help 
Aye thanks neighbor! 
It wasn't actually! (That's one my to-read list) It was Zen and The Art Of Happiness - amazing book 
I vote for people.  I don't vote for parties.
Good on you for doing all that stuff! That's impressive. \n\nMy therapist and psychiatrist both say that an elevated heart rate often causes a panic attack, same thing happens to me after a workout. They told me to just keep doing it, maybe starting slower and then moving up back to full workouts. 
Huh that's good to hear! Who knows maybe in a few years I'll see where my head and health is at and I'll think about joining after all. I appreciate it 
Shit
You can? I always thought that would annoy the bartender/be weird? Though I did get a water with my friend at a pizza place/bar while he got cider and ended up chatting with the female bartender a good amount 
> Gina Carano\n\nWhat? She is the farthest thing from fat. It was like Rosie O'Donnell when her pics looked like Courteney Cox
I think it's always been this way, if not worse (hello slavery, segregation, etc.?) but you just hear more about it because of the internet 
I believe it does if not it still flares up a lot I can't see myself being of any use with it. Also good on you for doing that! I hope to be off meds one day but for right now they are much needed, only started them a few months ago. I was also in a mental hospital for 4 days, not sure if that disqualifies me as well? 
That's a good idea I never thought of that, though if I don't have that raging heavy metal music I won't perform that well haha \n\nMention this to your psychiatrist if you have one they might have more words of advice. \n\nLet me know how it works out! 
I didn't even say the word to the tea shop lady because I didn't know what they were I just said "those over there" and I guess I just got the spelling wrong from what I heard her say 
Thanks! Where the hell do I buy one though? And $700 sheesh 
Thank you! I actually have had macaroons now that I googled it. I just never knew what they were called, I like them - but those dark chocolate macarons in the picture <3
Is it in one spot or everywhere? I used to get HUGE wet marks under my arms. My doctor said it might be anxiety related, but was probably not 100% caused by anxiety so he prescribed me special deodorant stuff. Totally solved the problem! And now I'm less anxious around people not worrying about my arm pit stains 
What do you think of this: she's kind of a nerd like me and she collects those Pop figures. She mentioned there's one she wanted and it's one of my favorites as well, and they're only like $10 anyway should I get it for her? 
Was it Universe in A Nutshell? I started reading that book a year ago and only understood like one thing in the first 100 or so pages haha 
Glass places really can't make glass up for the dimensions of the top?
Did you read the non-TL;DR? I mentioned using OKC, Tinder, and Bumble for a year without much success 
Yea maybe for date #2 for sure (if there is one of course)
I might have to get a little Hawaiian girl for my dash 
Same I'm 2 beers into self loathing now it's all ruined 
That's good though! You'll probably notice it goes down with time but still treating the main cause (being anxiety) will be the ultimate solution 
That makes sense. I always try to think of reading like I do working out. But then again some books feel more like a fun movie than a workout at all so it makes it even harder to read a more difficult dense book afterwards. \n\nI think I will take that advice. This is only my second book on the subject of Zen (very interested in it) and I may have jumped the gun a bit 
Funny I just rejoined meetup, trying to find a book club or something, have fun! 
Goals
That's a sick color combo I don't see done often 
Stopped by the town airport to have a cigar and watch some planes take off. Finally got to ride with the top down after winter (hopefully it's over)
What are these used for or was it just a for fun contest?
Well I go to car meets all the time and I'm doing some Autocross this summer. I thought the painting classes are usually drink and paint, at least around here 
I'll usually check the overall star count on Goodreads first (above a 3.5 I usually bite) then the full reviews on Goodreads and Reddit after I finish. I like to form my own opinion before I see others'
Do you have a link to that Dotpad? Can't seem to find it anywhere 
This doesn't quite work with my 91 Miata haha I wish I could 
What do you think of this: she's kind of a nerd like me and she collects those Pop figures. She mentioned there's one she wanted and it's one of my favorites as well, and they're only like $10 anyway should I get it for her?
Thanks a lot bud. I will take it easy I'm not that good with loss like this. On a positive note this Undercrown turned out to be fantastic might be a new favorite 
I am still trying OkCupid and Tinder, recently re-did my profile after getting suggestions on /r/OkCupid \n\nI literally don't mind being the DD at all, I love driving. And yea like I said I don't have a problem with drinking itself so as long as a girl is cool with me getting water or something while she drinks then no problem with me \n\nI don't think I'd sign up for those *just* to meet someone, I would legitimately have fun as they are my hobbies anyway 
Thanks I'm kind of hard on myself when it comes to stuff like this \n\nI'd say it's largely the first reason but a touch of the second but I think that's just how he talks 
Thanks a lot! I'm in the US :/
In my 20s, male in decent shape, resting like 80bpm \n\nAnxiety is a bitch 
Probably right thanks 
Cool thank you I won't do any gifts. 
Yea you all have a good point, thank you 
This is my first date with this girl (3rd first date in my life I'm 20) and you are absolutely right, even my therapist says the buildup is always way worse than the actual event. Plus side is I'm not even THAT worried like I was in the past. I agree this is more about going and saying to myself I went. \n\nThank you!
It was apart of their lending library I want to get my own copy! 
Cool thanks! \n\nAlso as a new-ish photographer - in lew of your original comment: what are some situations where I could benefit from a hard hat and high vis vest? I can think of one instance where I drove by an abandoned barn but I didn't want to go check it out and photograph since it might have been private property, but that's about it. Maybe while doing landscapes but standing at the beach with a high vis vest and hard hat seems a bit loopy 
Sounds like you need some help friend. My psychiatrist has really helped with these intrusive thoughts through medication and therapy. I really think you'd benefit from one of or both of those.\n\nIf I could give a tip, from someone with OCD mainly intrusive thoughts about death and violence, don't fight them. The more you fight and push them the worse they get. Just let them happen.
Me! I carry [this leather bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JUNSRPS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with me everywhere. I call it a man purse with 0 shame because it is. I can't stand having things in my pockets and this way I have everything I need, and I can use it for school and carry my DSLR with me 
Pls send it to me \n\nJk you don't have to but yea apparently! 
I meant honeybush sorry - it was actually a rooibos anyway 
Thank you! I searched what you said and signed up to volunteer at the VA hospital near me. If that doesn't work out I saw a bunch of other options too 
Hey I have a date tonight!! You've motivated me to not back out. Unfortunately Lexapro didn't work for me. I'm on Effexor now and still need Ativan before this date haha 
Might have to try this. I've heard people using this technique when going urban exploring as well 
Oh wow I love it 
That sounds awesome my dad has a Bruins one like that I'm always jealous when he wears it. Would be a nice golf shirt 
Yea I don't think I will ever "get used to" alcohol I never get a buzz or feel better, just more anxious 
Dammit I'm going for a vintage look and this is the first radio I've seen that would look nice :/ that's a rollbar and a luggage rack worth of cash though 
Oh yea, I've avoided caffeine completely (or as close to it as I can) for years. I've been there and usually get decaf English breakfast tea haha 
Same have been meaning to play that game anyway 
Same [I love mine](http://i.imgur.com/lIB0YLc.jpg) doesn't effect the smile haha 
Seconded Amazon. I've recently picked up quite a few of the books I want to read for the price that one of them would be new. \n\nAlso thrift stores are a good one, but often times there's a lot of nothing and all mixed up so I don't spend much time there, and they can be kind of pricey tbh. I did find a brand new copy of Life of Pi there this week that was cool 
Alright, cool. I appreciate it. Now to do some research on how to do all of that :)

Had a long week myself, unfortunately got news today that a friend of mine's son took his life. Always reach out if you feel you can't go on anymore peeps. It sucks.\n\nHaving a stick for him and his family tonight, wasn't going to smoke but I figured it should be done. Had this [Drew Estate Undercrown](http://i.imgur.com/yeDfscH.jpg) in my humidor I was holding off on trying, also had one UFO left in the fridge. \n\nHug your loved ones tonight guys. 
What would be an example of a virgin drink? I've never heard of that 
Was about to order the vintage mirrors and a plate frame friday yessssssss
What are some photography opportunities that would call for this though? I suppose urban exploration is one, and maybe landscapes but can't think of many others 
The fact that you refer to people not in JROTC as civilians is slightly unsettling to me.
Yes. I'm gay, but you wouldn't think so unless I told you, and even then you might not believe me. The majority of my friends are straight guys who I probably wouldn't have been able to become friends with if I was a stereotypical gay guy, even though they know I'm gay.\n\n\nHowever, that doesn't make them homophobic imo. Even I find the "gay stereotype" irritating sometimes.
The best moment to come out is when you're ready to come out. I came out to some friends over text, some at school, etc. I wouldn't say there is necessarily a "right time," though. It's really all in your head. If they're good friends they won't care no matter when you come out to them.
Just like mom used to heat up
Looking forward to getting myself a Polaris card some time! Awesome work, guys!
Yes. My name and address are on the slip.
Please don't listen to this guy, OP. It's probably best to assume he's straight. Hint at the fact that you're gay, and if he is too then great. Otherwise, you're just friends.

Where's Bob Loblaw when you need him?
Hmm. Unfortunately I'm away from my computer for the next several hours. If this isn't a top priority, I can definitely take some time to try and help you out later.

Can't really help with funding unfortunately, but I have several years experience running fairly heavily populated servers. Hit me up if you ever need some help with something.
"LOOK AT THAT! HOLY SHIT! ITS COLD IN HERE, HUH?"
I support Bernie and hate Shillary. He never said he supported Trump.
He should really take a look at Bob Loblaw's Law Blog.
Chances are it's Adobe Illustrator considering its more or less the industry standard for graphic design. Not sure how he did it though. It almost looks like he just imported it and converted it to a vector with the high fidelity preset, but the brush strokes say otherwise.
You as well! Have a good 2017!
My bad, I guess that was a little confusing. I was not expecting anything, but we were expecting it when I was mailed one before.
lol
They play at New Milford and Owego fields, but the leader is in Port Crane.

So then there's nothing you can do. Not everybody in JROTC cares about it.
In all honesty I feel like my NSIs dont like me, but i have no clue why. I'm in color guard, pass my PT tests, have good grades, but I am late sometimes given that I'm in zero hour. I dont even get responses to my emails 90% of the time.
Pepe is a dead meme, bro. Papa Johns is where it's at these days.
I'm not saying you're in the wrong, and you were absolutely right to correct him, however I think you may be making a bigger deal out of this than it should be. Rank means pretty much nothing in JROTC. It's basically just a show of how much effort you put into it. The fact that you're a "top cadet" or CO or whatever really doesn't mean much.\n\nNow again, correcting him is the right thing to do, but that's all that needs to be done. If he fixes it, great. If he talks back and doesn't fix it, then say okay, walk away, and report him to your instructors. JROTC is a great program, but don't take it so seriously that a uniform violation gets you so up in arms. It's wrong, sure. But the world isn't going to fall apart.\n\nGood luck :)
I'm by no means an economist and I'm really not at all involved in any crypto communities, but if dogecoins are constantly being mined, isn't that sort of counterintuitive if it's a goal for dogecoins to be worth more?
Oh boy another person who doesn't understand the difference between democratic socialism and communism.
It's more or less just a virus disguised as an AV.

Oh fuck that. When I was 14 I was on the verge of tears every night because of all the stress that school was casing me.
Yep. I've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and ever since I resorted to running as a way to deal with it, I've learned to love it. Sure, the time you spend running sucks, but it's nice to get out in some fresh air and listen to music, away from all your problems. Makes your problems seem smaller than they did before, and it makes you feel like you've done something productive.
Damn. That's one sexy car.
It has my name on it.
If it was a warrant wouldn't it be served by my county or state? Why would I be getting a warrant from MO?
Christ that escalated quickly 
Just out of curiosity, why would you remove this?
I have a MICH-2001 I'm looking to get rid of. Tan. Several active duty military said it looks and feels real, just stripped of its Kevlar lining, so I'm not positive on whether it's real or not.\n\nI'm looking to get about $60 for it but I can go lower if you're interested. I'll ship it off to ya for free.
Sure thing.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/HpGfJ
GET EM OUT OF HERE
No. I have been mailed a copy of a search warrant via certified mail (for reasons I'd rather not discuss) before, though we were told to expect it. The recipient was one of my parent's, then. I suppose that's why I'm freaking out.
You're reading a bit too far into this, bud.
No I am ur broyher
I don't think wearing a police uniform will go over very well.
The Bradberry boys at it again with another goof!
Similar problem here. I'm a Navy unit, and there's this one cadet who sucks up so hard to the SNSI and NSI that she might as well be in charge of them.\n\nShe more or less has every NS1 at the tips of her fingers and eager to do anything she says, yet she doesn't do her job and whenever someone else does it for her, she flips out and gets them in trouble.
Plus, they're Marines. They don't need guns in the first place.
If there's anything that Generation Kill taught me, it's that deployments usually consist of 98% jerking off.\n\nThank you for your service, by the way.

This is a red herring. 
Just so you know, you only use "an" if the next word has a vowel as its first letter. :)\n\nFor example, "an apple" and "a car"

I haven't used server-pushed resource packs in quite a while, but I have before. What problems are you having? If I remember correctly the pack has to be uploaded to somewhere like Dropbox where it can be set to automatically download.\n\nI should be able to get it figured out for you, but I'd need more information on what issues you're having haha.
I'm Navy JROTC, but I know of at least one transgender officer in my regiment. I'm zero hour though, so I don't get to talk to any other periods much. Could be some others
Both! I really think it would look good on you
I do have a pretty unique name, yes. That's a bit more comforting, but I've never heard of or experienced cert mail being anything but bad news.
lmao this is a joke right
I had one of those moments a few months ago. It was pretty rough finding new friends, but at least I know these ones are real... At least I hope so.\n\nShit here comes the self esteem issues.
I listen to podcasts
They aren't. Most of my friends are guys, and I find them just as okay with it as every girl I've ever met. I'm openly gay, albeit very masculine compared to the "gay stereotype."\n\nI think it's that girls fine the whole gay voice and all that "cute" whereas guys find it annoying. I don't have that voice, and even I tend to get annoyed by it on occasion.
Pepe died aged ago guys.. Are we seriously still calling him a meme?
Fuck my sides
I forgot to mention in the OP that I'm a minor and can't sign for it.
Well I don't live in MO, never been to MO, and have never been called to court. So that's ruled out.
You're a special one, you.
I'm offended. Please refer to me as "infantryperson." /s
It happens :) No worries. Glad you got it sorted out.
What?
Smoking cigarretes.
Awesome! Been thinking of doing something like this but powered by a Raspberry Pi. Just gotta do some more planning and order all of the displays and stuff for it.
WEEEEEEEEEW
Oh grow up. She's a celebrity. OP is not  the first one to take a picture of a celebrity without them knowing.
You're experiencing the Baader-Meinhof effect.
Well judging from your username you're a man. I'm going to guess that it didn't work out because lesbians maybe arent into men? Just an idea
Yeah! My friend who lives up in Peoria sent it to me and I thought it was really awesome.
Speak for yourself
No, the original comment stayed on the topic of Trump's hypocrisy in terms of promising a blind trust and in turn not delivering. The comment in a natural extension of that premise. What you did was not simply moving the goal post, but moving to an entirely different field of play.  
I VERY much disagree with you. My wife eats these all the time and they smell a lot. And heaven help you when she cooks with them. 
What is? That Trump used that same line of reasoning?\n\n"Pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! Bad reporter."\n-Donald Trump, when asked to back up his assertion of voter fraud.\n\nPlease respond.
I see. That's what I inferred from the comment anyway.
I'm not trying to attack you and I thank you for your honest response , but how is Carson for example, appropriate for his appointment?
I, of course, didn't say any of that. Also I notice you still haven't provided an example.
Kunming, China.
I guess this means you don't have any evidence proving your claim. I understand why you wouldn't want to just admit that I guess, but this would be a more productive discussion if you could.
Based on your grammar, I don't think you want to go around criticising the IQ of others. 
All joking aside, DK always struck me as having a pretty high baseball IQ. This seems like a great roll for him. 
I'm sure he was taking all of his own tests and writing all of his own papers at Michigan State. 
31k? Have you been saving specifically for this purpose?
All a matter of context I guess. My wife is a Chinese immigrant and I can't get her to throw away a pair of broken eyeglasses.
I'm sincerely curious as to what point you're trying to make with the Jackson, Edison statement. Am I missing something?
You know who his base loves more? Trump. I hope you're right because Mattis is literally the ONLY nominee of whom I thought to myself, 'well, I guess I could live with that choice.' And considering this posturing, a Russia hardliner is clearly needed to balance the scales. 
I don't want to bet. I want people to act like fucking adults 
There it is.
Actually I addressed that in my first post when I stated you're not comparing apples to apples. You apparently have forgotten, or didn't understand in the first place. Furthermore, your reversion to petty attempts at critiquing my intellect serves only distract and ultimately diminish the point you're trying to make in the first place. \n\nSince you made the claim in the first place, please provide some evidence that European nations were engaging in efforts of a similar scale to sway the election in favor of Hillary. 
The article isn't reporting that Trump is mentally unwell. That would indeed be unsubstantiated (mostly) as you claim. The article is about how people are worried that he may be mentally unwell. There is a big difference.
This person is driving way too fast.
Anyone have a negative review? I just bought JBL reflect Mini bts for 89$ and have been pretty happy but would be happy to return and try these given the discount. How is the volume on these? The band connecting the earpieces was a turnoff for me - anyone find that annoying?
Good one.
Be careful with your Ikea shoe rack. We had one several years ago and it lasted for a good month before falling apart.

You were very triggered by 3 mere comments? Anyway snowflake, I agree this is hilarious and sad. 
What was the specific example? I recall a vague reference to the BBC with no specific mention of any overt efforts to influence anything- is this the "example" to which you are referring? I'm looking for a specific example of a concentrated effort to sway the electorate in favor of HRC which you have suggested happened. Please provide evidence of this having happened. 
What? I legitimately don't understand what you're insinuating.
Well, when you say "you all" that is not genuine or honest. You don't know me and I don't know you; I wasn't even subbed here until yesterday. Beyond that I don't see the connection between Hillary being preferred by our allies and Russia's influence. Care to clarify?
I believe she would be promptly sued.
What mean is 31k at only 8 weeks old is pretty substantial. Have you been saving for a while pre-kid?
I'll give her this; it's hard to admit you were wrong - especially after this highly tense election. Kudos to her for recognizing it and not doubling down or going through the mental gymnastics of denial.
Thanks for posting this. This sentiment of immediacy has me worried. Progressives will eat their own for ANY sleight. I'm not saying its wrong to hold folks accountable for their actions- but I really fear loosing sight of longer term goals because we pay more attention. Love it or leave it-we're in a partisan fight. 
I have a portable charger in my drop bag. My Garmin watch will last 8 hours while reading recording.
A bodyweight strength routine 3 days a week would be ideal. Also, varying your distance and intensity would be a wise choice. The 10% rule generally works pretty well for folks. 
An article was posted about Trump's financials, and a comment thread spun from that premise. You ignored the premise and changed the topic from Trump's financials to Tillerson's. I can only assume that you changed the subject from Trump to Tillerson because Trump not divesting is indefensible. You apparently want to shift focus from Trump to Tillerson. Tillerson creating a blind trust has nothing to do with Trump and it was a red Herring to bring it up in this context. 
Your comment is absurd, wrong and Fallacious.
?
I was terrified about the dog getting too close to the cars tires.
I think Hillary beating the drum right now would be VERY bad for whatever causes she would be advocating.
I was agreeing with you! Snowflake is a term of endearment, right? 
I think he has to nix the nomination. You can't come out that strong against your own party's nominee in questioning and vote yes anyway-That would look far worse than a rubber-stamp yes. 
Do you have evidence that Ted Cruz' s father didn't assassinate JFK? I know it was a tabloid with an immense history of lying that levied the accusation, but I still need some evidence that the accusation itself is untrue.  
To be fair those are pretty high profile appointments. 
Jeebus Cripes
I think any naysayers are underestimating what a giant chump Cruz is. He proved himself to be remarkably beatable just by being himself this election cycle. 
How so?
What is "the black average?"
Too much pressure is dangerous. She should be more careful. I messed up my inner ear one time. Took a while to get right.
Okay, but in your original post you called this story unsubstantiated which is not the case. 
I'm sure you posted here by accident but running was for me probably the most important factor in getting through my divorce as a healthier (physically healthier and mentally)person. Best of luck to you.
How do you reconcile your comment with his stated desire for an arms race?
What is going on in this thread? Jesus!
It's okay because he's forgiven himself.
I don't think you know what a claim really is if you feel your earlier posts weren't full of them.
It's funny you say that. I was born and grew up in Detroit and my family was on govt. Assistance. I can assure you, I would make a shit HUD secretary.
Okay then, let's all pack it in a write off 2018. Shut down the sub! According to dallasdude we shouldn't try!
Logical reasoning has also proven useless in my experience.
Did I just hear someone casually wish death on another human? That's pretty fucked up.

I don't understand why you continue to respond. What a wierdo.
Kenny "motherfuckin'" Daniels. He has had a hard year but he is one of the very best.
Alright then.
> Constitution doesn't have any requirements that Russia stay uninvolved.\n\nThis is to what I was referring. I don't think the constitution needs to specifically address this for us to know it is a problem. When I say apples to apples-I'm saying nothing on this scale has happened before. Am I wrong? \n
Yeah, this is all her fault! 
The problem is every opportunity to prove guilt is being undercut. 
The comment was about hypocrisy as it relates to Trump's business ties which of course is the subject of the article. No where in the article was Tillerson even mentioned; yet you felt compelled to bring him up. Also, I never said what you claim I did. 
Thank god. For a moment I thought you were asserting BO was inarticulate. He has been called many things, but inarticulate just doesn't hold water. Especially in contrast - as the OC was alluding to - to our president elect. 
Who told you that?
Movies have been made about how shitty getting your start in radio is. \n\nAt what station in Detroit did you intern?
This is fantastic, really my ideal. I'm guessing you don't have a mother-in-law.
I think the marches and protests are focused. The way the media covers them however shapes your takeaway. It's almost as though they have an interest in crafting their own narrative instead of reporting. 
Jesus man, I'm so sorry for your loss.
This is a very bad idea due to humidity and moisture. 
Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is the same logic Trump has used time and time and time again to push whatever baseless narrative he felt like. I hope this is the point hammer is trying to make. 
How is this fake news? Do you understand what fake news is? When Ted Cruz's dad assasinated JFK - that was fake news. This is not that.
Who are these 'People" you're speaking of? Also, I have a very hard time following your logic. Are you saying when people assert that Tom Brady is the G.O.A.T. they're trying to argue, greatest male athlete of any sport? If so, I very much disagree that people are trying to make that assertion. This sounds like a problem you have made in your own head. 
?
Vue has dvr though, which is how I watch most games.
It in no way answered the question.

Whether that's true or not is beside the point. Your red herring is a silly attempt to derail a conversation.
Are you stating this because you don't think it will happen, or because you will be so happy if it does?
"The same or worse." Not even remotely close. Obama caught shit for eating Dijon mustard and wearing a tan suit. If Obama had done anything an eight as severe as what Trump does within his first 15 minutes of waking republicans and 1/2 the electorate would be losing their minds. 
Very, very much less how.
See in your post where you state what my positions supposedly are based of course only upon your own assertions?
What am I underestimating? This is so foolish. Are you saying there is no point in running anyone against him? I don't understand your negativity.
Man alive, you are throwing strawmen around like they're on sale.
You have to be kidding, right?
I don't think they would want to, no. But suppose we started a trade war and put them in the unfortunate position of needing to. 
You're not comparing apples to apples. Also, are you seriously arguing for foreign powers influencing our elections? 
What do you think the standard should be?
Buy what will he say?
For what school do you run?\n

I think this is indeed a mystery. I have seen the popping up on a ton of small subs the last few days. It's always in imgur link though. The mystery is, what is being gained? what is the point of all of these posts?
While this is awesome, I definitely think it is less interesting with the amount of trolling that is happening on it.\n\nGood luck, it's pretty cool.
Thanks for that :)
[google Hirst Arts Castles](https://www.smooth-on.com/product-line/pressure-vacuum-chambers/)  \n\nHirst Arts is the company who makes molds.  
My friends parents live in Kentucky.  Her dad had found a deer who had a leg injury and nursed the thing back to health.\n\nBefore he took it upon himself, he called around.  Shelters, vets, game wardens etc.  All of them said either "We won't take it, shoot it" or "We won't take it but we could shoot it for you."\n\nWhen they asked if they could rehab it themselves - "That's illegal, if anyone finds out, they will come and shoot it, except that you won't be able to keep the meat."\n\nSo while it kind of sucks, it also doesn't take much digging to find out that keeping a deer as a pet is illegal and that it will be shot if they find out.  Having a pet deer is a risk.  On an aside, a lot of people think of deer as pests, which drives them further away from what people would consider makes an appropriate pet and makes it easier to shoot one.
Where I live right now, in order to have a native animal, I need rehab certifications and a bunch of other stuff.  If I wanted a native crow, I need that stuff.  If I want to get an exotic pet, such as a pied crow, I can do that with little to no hassel.\n\nI don't know what happens as you move into more dangerous animals.  Never researched it.  Only crows and deer and only in a couple of states.
Thanks for this.  I didn't understand most of the words in the article but I understood most of yours.\n\nSincerely,\n\n  -A Yank
True, I was thinking more of 'shit that happened since the 80s' but if we're talking about things that have messed up the middle east, it doesn't make sense to ignore how the countries came to be.
Pardon my lack goo CS:GO knowledge but do they really not have a way to force away all the skins so you just see everything vanilla?\n\nI feel like it would be akin to turning particles off/down in other games.
Smoking meth and IVing heroin while sky diving is bad for you?\n\nThat's what they said about Rock 'n Roll!\n\nNot trying to argue that video games are bad for you, just that boiling down the argument into that comparison is silly.
I kind of assumed that the babyblaster 5000 wasn't particularly compatible with their PA system and in order to get it working they need to fudge things up with the PA system.\n\nStill feels like something that could be reversed.  Even if they were forced to remove components to make it work, those can be replaced (especially if they were saved).  Certainly feels like $NA just wanted a new PA and made it happen.
Well, Russian democracy is a bit more fucked than the American version or at least it was.  We didn't used to have state-run media, though Breitbart kind of is now (not saying our media doesn't suck but it hasn't really been state run).  We also don't have a president who  has had political opposition assassinated (yet) and we don't have a president who has full on ignored term limits.\n\nSo, I would say that the average Russian holds fewer keys to power than the average American, thus holds less responsibility for their governments actions.\n\nThough I do think\n\n>Kind of, yes.\n\nis a good response.
I came her to post the same thing.  Denver or Boulder should be able to support a decent sized rally.  Don't know if anything can get organized in the next five days though.
I don't know why you think that people being disrupted are against the immigration ban already.  Trump supports use airplanes too (right?).\n\nSecondly, it is not like keeping you from shopping because kids are starving in Africa.  It is keeping Americans from flying because of a decision that affects America.  Most people who've been disrupted by this are Americans who have the ability to use their voice to inform their representatives that they have an opinion.  You don't have much power to stop hunger in Africa, you have a lot more power to affect changes in the Democracy you live in, through voting, running for elected office, contacting representatives, social organisation etc.\n\nFurthermore, disruption gathers news.  If you're pissed because you missed a flight because of a protest, you're probably bitching on twitter or facebook.  This spreads the protestors message.  The news will cover larger disruptions because news follows bigger stories.  Things being shut down are bigger stories, this spreads the message.\n\nIt doesn't always spread the message in a positive light but the message spreads more thoroughly.\n\nYou can disagree with their methods but I don't see you out there trying to lead better styles of protests.\n\n
My thesis was that the emails are an overblown scandal and there isn't evidence of criminal malice or negligence.\n\nMalice in other aspects of her life doesn't have any regard about her actions regarding her use of a private email server.  So why are you just trying too bring up other reasons you hate Clinton?\n\nYou also just lumped me into a group as a way to dismiss me.  I tried to present a cogent argument and you decided to write me off as hysterical and change the subject.\n\n\n
I found the hand writing out all the steps to be distracting.  I thought it was a cool effect but definitely a bit over used here to it's detriment.
Lets not ignore the fact that:\n\n> As police decided that could not guarantee Mr Yiannopoulos’ security, officers cancelled the event and removed him from the building.\n\nYeah, Police said they couldn't guarantee safety, which seems like a decent reason to cancel an event.
Mamazing is saying the same thing I said.  Because of the way English speakers read, we go left to right, drop a line and go all the way back to the left to start again.  Because we read this way, we also have a tendency to scan a page in the same manner.\n\nI claimed that yes should be last because I personally believe that affirmation of choice should be the last thing you see because you need too scan all the other options before you get to 'yes this is what I want (I mean, you obviously don't really have too but it is encouraged by button placement).\n\nChanging a button placement that has a long standing history is a pain in the butt.  I agree that making the change is not pleasant but at the same time I think it is a small improvement for UX in the long term (though in the short term it is really, really painful for a significant swath of the user base).\n\n
Lots of comments about the "execution is key" and "its a trope for a reason" kind of things so I will just go into some of the things that make this such a useful trope.\n\nIn normal situations these people would dismiss each other.  Maybe they have even *been* dismissing each other before the story starts.\n\nThen there is a call to action.  These people are brought together and share a common goal.  They might want to go about it different ways and this creates tension/conflict that adds another dimension to achieving their shared goal.\n\nThey are forced to work in concert; they need to learn to understand each other and trust each other.  Earning trust and understanding creates some nice arcs in the rising action.  Since they normally would have dismissed each other, there are also opportunities to find some shared ground outside of their main goal.\n\nAs they overcome obstacles together, this trust and understanding is strengthened.\n\nAt the end, they understand and can deal with each others faults/eccentricities.  They take each other as they are, not to mention they have grown and changed together through a common experience.  This is a good foundation for any kind of relationship.\n\nIt is useful.  It brings conflict to your rising action and creates drama and adds another satisfying note to your resolution.  The key, is that it should feel natural to your characters.  If it doesn't feel natural, you shouldn't do it.\n\nThis is the basis of the buddy cop genre.  So they don't necessarily need to be banging it out at the end.  They could just appreciate each other in a new way.  They may even have romantic feelings they don't act on.  Write what your characters would do, and simply be informed by people who have used the trope before.
Yeah, I mean, I tried not to take too much of a side on the issue.  Just saying that in my experience, if you say 'I have a deer' (at least in the part of Kentucky I was in) you are basically inundated with people telling you to shoot it and that it will be shot by authorities if you don't shoot it.
He wasn't required to enter that Walmart by law.  He had three choices.\n\n1. Get lunch anywhere but the Walmart where he works.\n\n2. Leave his gun in the car and break policy/state law (also not a good choice).\n\n3.  Eat at the Walmart where he works and lose his job at the branch.\n\nHe *chose* option number three.  Now, had he been sent to Walmart on a call, this discussion might be different but they didn't inhibit his ability to do his job.  They inhibited his ability to eat lunch at the Walmart where he works while on duty as a cop.
Deer aren't exotic pets.  You could get an exotic species of deer as a pet in Kentucky with an appropriate license but not a native species.\n\nThis is my understanding as of the last time I looked into the law regarding these things, which, I will admit, was many years ago.
I just switched off Progressive myself.  My six months was almost up so I started checking around.  I shot their customer service an email saying I was going to be leaving if they couldn't meet the prices I was finding (which were lower for every single insurance company that I checked).  Next morning I have an email that basically says 'Yup, that sounds right.  We don't price match either.'\n\nAfter I left they sent me a couple of emails reading 'We miss you!  Come back!  We won't charge you any less but we think your money is neat!'
I haven't heard that reasoning before, its an interesting one.  Thanks.
Told everyone they shot it.  Nursed it back to health, while being as hands off as they could.  Eventually it walked out of the barn they had it in and they didn't see it again.
>  I just wanted to be clear that this being the law doesn't mean it isn't enforced poorly, especially in this case.\n\nThis is fine and good but:\n\n> You listed a lot of reasons why one would expect their deer killed but none of them justify it\n\nDoesn't make it clear that it is enforced poorly in this case.\n\nIf you are coming from a place where you have information about the reasoning behind the laws that these wardens acted on, you could have made a comment regarding that reasoning.\n\nYou could have made a point about the method of enforcement they used (which seems quite sudden from the video) and clearly in front of a young lady who cares about the animal.  This was not the best execution of a law, even if you consider the law just.\n\n> I don't think you know enough about me to tell me to "do some research"\n\nYour comment indicated that you were coming from a place without much knowledge of the subject and a lot of *feelings* on the subject.  If you knew a lot about the subject I would have assumed you would have used your knowledge to actually say something.\n
You deserve gold.
Cans also compress better than bottles, so its easier to pack them in and pack them out.
> Or directed her to the entity that does know.\n\nAlways dump them to the people who are in a position to know.  People don't like to hear 'I'm sorry it's not my job.'  They are slightly more amenable to 'It's their job, go talk to them.'
Literally every media outlet I check is covering this...
We did auto-gratuity at a place I used to work.  We were mostly a counter service place and when we did table service it kind of through a wrench into the system (we're talking like three tables a night but because we don't  have designated servers, your cooking food, refreshing/making drinks/ringing up other customers, scooping ice cream, making coffee, etc.\n\nI wasn't able too convince my boss table service was a bad call but I was able to convince her to do forced gratuity on the check.  Small win for us in a not hot situation.
It is also because people (well, people who read certain languages) read right to left and from the top down.\n\nThe bottom right is a natural place to put yes because the eyes will scan to it last.
That's messed up, but honestly, he did you a favor.  Any institution that takes crap like that from customers isn't worth working for.  Managers should always have your back when you need it.\n\nI hope things are better for you now.
I kind of enjoy going down on a girl who's gotten kind of sweaty from the day.  I mean, I'm not into strange discharges and the funky - I don't clean up my pussy ever - smell.  Come home with my after a concert though and I will be happy to enjoy every inch of your sweaty body.
Agreed.
Reminds me of stubby bob from Roadkill.
My question was why he left the container of gasoline so fucking close to the explosive leaf situation he had going on.

State law requires him to carry his gun while on duty.  It does not require him to maintain his second job while doing his primary job.\n\nIn this case his jobs conflicted.  He had three choices.  Not get lunch at Walmart, break state law and leave his gun in his car, or get fired for going to the Walmart where he works while carrying a gun.\n\nThe policy apparently is only in the store where he works too.  So he could have gone to any other Walmart and been fine.  They even offered to let him work at another Walmart so he could come into that Walmart and grab his lunch.\n\nWalmart wasn't breaking the law, their company policy doesn't prevent cops from entering with guns, it only prevents cops with a second job at Walmart from entering the store they work at with a gun and keeping their job at that location.
Buying directly from the manufacturer that supplies dollar shave club is a better deal.
Much faster to shoot an animal.  You don't have to figure out dosage.  The meat doesn't spoil (and people want deer meat).
Graduated with a degree in biology in 2010.  Little did I know that working in a kitchen was the best job I could get.\n\nI feel for you.  Good luck with the job hunt.

Generally, I believe that the affirmative should be last because it forces your eyes to exhaust every other option before hitting the affirmative.\n\nHai-sea-ewe makes the opposing argument that when there is a yes/no option, it should appear in the order in which people speak.  This is an argument that opposes mine and is certainly not wrong.
It always reminded me of the couples I've known that have fallen into excessive drug addictions together.  The song feels like the point when doing drugs together is still really fun.\n\nYou know, before they move in together because it's cheaper and they can afford more drugs that way.  Then they stop seeing any of their friends, lose their jobs and the girlfriend (or boyfriend) ends up sleeping with the dealer for drugs and shit gets heavy and needs too end between the two of them and their habit.\n\nSo that's what I always took away from the song.  Being in a relationship with someone where they share a mutual cocaine addiction.
Wait, I'm in a similar boat.  What happened the second time?  I'm kind of missing out on what happened too team Flex...
I think he is suggesting that colleagues of his are researching methods of replacing fat cells containing fat soluble environmental toxins.  I don't think he suggested that a potato slice is the method that is being researched.
That's more than half a pound.  That's like a quarter pounder, some fires and a salad.\n\nIt may not be huge but I think the appropriate description of .55lbs of food is that it is a normal portion.
It didn't look like he killed it when I re-watched the part of him dumping it on the leaves.
> The emails weren't a real fucking issue\n\n> I respectfully disagree. It was never really about emails.\n\n???\n\n> She says she is horrible at IT, so why did she set up her own server? That kind of thing.\n\nShe didn't, the server was one that Bill had used for the Clinton foundation and was repurposed for her e-mail server.\n\n> Her team handled the email issue in such a bad way. They deliberately made it confusing, denying everything, claiming she had apologized when she hadn't, saying emails weren't classified 'when they were sent', claiming she didn't know what 'C' meant\n\nHave you ever dealt with end users?  Go check out r/tfts and educate yourself on the shit people say when they simply don't know what they're doing with technology.  Then come back and decide if they were being deliberate or just stupid.\n\n> saying emails weren't classified 'when they were sent\n\nThat happened.\n\n> Mook and Podesta were shit at running a campaign\n\nTrue.\n\nNot saying she is a shining bright light of hope for humanity.  Just that the emails really didn't amount to anything because they weren't anything.  There wasn't intended harm or criminal negligence so its not a crime.\n\nIt doesn't help that there has been a two decade long smear campaign against her.
While that is annoying, I wouldn't want to spend the amount of time that is needed to spend to appropriately curate even a medium sized sub.\n\nIf auto-mod takes away a minute or two of your time but saves the moderators hours, then I get it.\n\nI'm not entirely sure that the 'too short' rule actually helps the mods but I understand where they are coming from.

Your random capitalizations and frequent typos make it hard to take you seriously.\n\nThat aside, what these electors are demanding is that *all* electors get briefed, not just the the 40 who are submitting an open petition.   The whole point of it is to get GOP electors briefed.\n\nFaithless electors are certainly rare, especially on a large scale.  The RNC as you pointed out, are good at vetting and keeping tabs on their electors.  If there is an issues there are some avenues for them to go about switching electors in some circumstances (until about December 13th).\n\nIf they were able to secure a briefing for all electors between the dates of December 13th and the 19th, there would be the greatest cause for concern in the Trump camp.\n\nI doubt the electors end up getting briefed.  I doubt there are more than a couple of faithless electors (but I would be surprised if there wasn't one or two).\n\nAlso, seriously dude, give your stuff a mild proof read, it is damn near impossible to read/understand what you wrote.  There are sentences that you start and neglect to finish before starting your next sentence.  If you want someone too help get your thoughts out in a more clear and concise way, I am happy to offer my services as a tutor.
Hitch hiking works okay in Iceland.  I wouldn't do it without a tent though.

Amen.  I'd like to think that at least you can check a couple of things off the list of potential careers but its more like 'guess I'm stuck doing what I do right now because I can't afford to quit.'\n\nGood luck.
Reminds me of [Krumholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krummholz) which happens above treeline in alpine regions in response to strong winds.\n\nFun fact, Krumholtz (and possibly some of the trees you show) actually move over time.
Honestly, it was American and Russian proxy wars.\n\nThey also had a resource that has high global demand which ended up funding some people who have radical ideologies.\n\nI mean, there is a ton of stuff wrapped in the 'bunch of shit' and to boil it down into 'America happened' is reductionist to the point of being untrue.  I would not say that America has been a shining beacon of hope but they are not the only ones using their influence on the situation.

That is because I am not trying to be an advocate or critic of the law. \n\nIf you have strong feelings you should do some research and contact people who share your opinions and want to change the law.
One goal of protests is disruption.  They aren't trying to make your day shitty so much as they are trying to make you notice.\n\nIf Trump managed to do the immigration ban nearly silently then it wouldn't affect a lot of Americans.  The protesters who are out there are not trying to say 'Your day is gonna be shitty' they are saying 'Your day might be a little shittier but you know who is having a much worse day?  Refugees who were about to get approval to leave a war torn country in favor of one that is only politically divided.'\n\nYou might just want to hop on a plane to get to a conference for work but they want to raise their kids in peace so they can grow up with the privilege to get on a plane and go to a conference and get inconvenienced by a group of people pushing to get the right thing done.
Well clearly racist refugees would end up bag in the queue to be traded for more refugees.

Be calm and honest about why you have spices in baggies in your car.  It will also help if you have some things that are blatantly spices in the mix like whole star anise, cinnamon sticks, cloves, etc.\n\nIf you still get arrested because an officer misidentifies one of your spices as something illicit you have a fairly strong case that you weren't trying to counterfit something illicit because it is labeled properly and sits among a collection of regular spices.
While I'm sure it helps with reducing the amount of time spent stocking, I imagine a large part amount of this is related to shipping costs.  This design means they can ship twice as many tubes in the same space.
Actual police were the ones who called off the rally, not campus police.\n\nI deliberately neglected your biased hypothetical because you are both generalizing groups, and changing situations.  You are also trying to say that because you think another group would do something similar in a situation that it is okay for another group too behave the way they are behaving.\n\nHave fun with yourself.  You're not worth my time.
Pardon my spreading of misinformation, although I think this also would differ state to state.
You say that with so much confidence but they are all so bad I don't think I can decide who's the worst.
It sucks losing someone that you loved.  The thing about life, is that it is always ups and downs.  You happened  to have spent time with someone whom you loved and that alone is a magical experience.\n\nThe time in the coming days, weeks, months and years will be strange, especially if this is your first big break up.  There will be times you are reminded of him/her and you will feel physically sick because you know their gone.  It's okay.  The feeling will become less visceral with time.\n\nIts very hard to do, but staying busy can be very helpful.  Is their a hobby you've always kind of wanted to try?  Now is the perfect time.  You'll have new faces who won't be tied up with weird break up politics, who you don't even need to tell about break up stuff.  It will also help remind you how much fun it can be to meet new people.\n\nThere is a freedom in being single.  Exercise that freedom.  Enjoy it, love it.  In time, another special person will show up in your life.  They will be different than your last love, try not to compare them.  In the mean time, try to reflect on the positives and negatives about your last relationship.  Try to notice the things that made you really happy and the things that caused problems (did you have different styles of conflict resolution?  Did you have trouble making decisions together? etc.)\n\nI'm off to dinner.  Goood luck, things will get better.
Enabling what exactly?
The emails weren't a real fucking issue.\n\nTrump supporters believe that the investigations should have found something.  The problem is that they needed to find either gross misconduct or intent.  They found neither because neither of those things happened.\n\nWas there some classified information?  Yes but there are different levels of classification.  Is 'Call X world leader because they are coming into office' a highly classified piece of information?  That is literally one of the classified emails she sent from her personal server.\n\nAre there some legitimate things to be concerned about with Clinton?  Yeah totally.  Are the emails a sign of corruption?  Not really, more that she isn't great with computers and doesn't have a shitload of time, partially because she spends a lot of time fundraising both for her political aspirations and for the Clinton foundation.  These aren't good things but people are blowing shit up because Hillary has been used as a punching bag by Republicans for the past twenty years.\n\nFurthermore, doing the analysis on the newly found emails takes almost no time.  The emails they uncovered were duplicates.  It takes almost no time to check to see if there are duplicates with a quick script.  He announced before he had even checked, which simply sounds malicious.\n\nHate Hillary if you want but hate her for the right reason.  The whole email scandal doesn't show she is malicious, just that her knowledge of computers and computer security is below what it should be.
I don't think it's ruining business.  If you and the people you do business with don't understand that the world can be unpredictable then you aren't likely to be in business very long.
Just because you experience time in a linear fashion doesn't mean you can foist your perspective on those of us who experience all of time consecutively.\n\nAlso, you can expect an even more large scale DDOS in October of this year too.
The only people who aren't allowed to bring in guns are employees of the store.  The officer got fired because he decided to break Walmart policy and get a lunch at the Walmart where he works.\n\nHe could have walked into any other Walmart where he wasn't employed and gotten lunch with no ramifications.
Was that supposed to be a good analogy?\n\nThose stores will likely have insurance that will cover the damages.  You will have criminal charges pressed against you and the insurance companies might come after you.  So yeah, they are likely to be prepared for the world to be unpredictable, that is how you run a business.

Well played.\n\nI haven't used the new LED ones but the ones we had back in the day worked okay so I imagine new LEDs would work well.
You're much better off doing a live demonstration.  Anything decent looking will cost a lot of money.  The ones doing it probably have already invested the money in 3d models to be CNC machined into molds. [Like this is an image for mold designs](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/466/478/2bccc89df35e61c5cbd7b21cac894e68_original.jpg?w=680&fit=max&v=1426768414&auto=format&q=92&s=f17df189ffdf9e6dcbb1fe9c270aef30)\n\nA 3D modeler would charge a few hundred to make each of those models in the picture. If you happen to find decent 3d "stock art" you're looking at $20~ per asset. Animating it is tough. 
> The claim of fascism thrown by the left to the right is like the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nNo, it is not.  If a small portion of a group are criminals it does not mean that the whole group is criminals nor does it change the relevance of claims made.  I'm not trying to say that the right is fascist just that you seriously need to take a class on rhetoric.\n\n> A campus for "free thought and expression" failed their goal.\n\nNo, police failed their goal.  The campus accepted a speaker with a different viewpoint than a large quantity of their campus (obviously not all as the talk was sponsored by a campus club).  They also allowed for peaceful protest.  When violent protest happened, they canceled the event at the instruction of the police.  The police failed to keep the event safe.\n\nNow, I don't believe what the rioters did was right, I think it was a horrendous act.  I think some of the actions surrounding law enforcement are a little sketchy and I would like more information on what went down with how things were handled (apparently funneling people out of the building and into the riot).\n\nThose issues, don't have anything to do with a campus that encouraged free speech until the police said they couldn't keep the event safe.  If you pull funding for the school you are also punishing the Republican club that wanted to bring Milo there in the first place.

> You listed a lot of reasons why one would expect their deer killed but none of them justify it\n\nYou may assume this is obvious and clear but it is not.  'It' refers to 'ones expectation of their deer being killed.'\n\nHad you changed it to 'the events in the video' or 'suddenly killing a loved animal in front of it's owner' it would have been clear.\n\nAfter your first comment I legitimately thought you were making a snide comment about the existence of laws that result in killing pet deer.\n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/5mr96m/pet_deer_named_after_bambi_character_shot_dead_in/dc5vio7/) comment, while crass, is actually clear.
So, I've been in the industry for a the last seven years.  I can tell you that right now, most places are hurting for employees.  It is much, muuuch harder to get fired in a kitchen if you know how to do your job than it used to be.\n\nDon't get me wrong, people will get annoyed with you if you use your sick days because it basically means more work for everyone else but job security shouldn't be an issue.

My friends parents were care taking like 50 acres of property.  They didn't even want it as a pet.\n\nThe law isn't about animal wellfare at all.  You can, in fact, get a deer as a pet as long as it's non native (and you have an exotic pet license).  This is something I learned when looking into getting a pet crow.  I can't own a crow native to my area but I can totally get a pied crow with appropriate licensure.\n\nNot sure the reasoning behind the law off the top of my head.  I want to say it had something to do with if the animal gets out of your care what kind of impact it would have on native animals but I kind of forget and don't really wanna look it up again.\n\n
Not saying it is right or that it couldn't have been done in a more respectful way, just that they probably knew what to expect when the wardens showed up (not that it makes it any easier to watch someone drive up, shoot someone/thing you love and drive away with the body).\n\nThere are also people elsewhere providing justifications for said law, if you're interested.
Unless you are at a rehab facility yeah and it also depends on the part of the country.
As of right now, it is kind of a Schroedingers deer.  It has both been shot and not shot.

They're just compression fittings?  $100 isn't really a "deal" then.  I would never pay a professional to install low quality materials, the cost is in the labor.

They were designed so non-plumbers could replace fixtures. The one tip I have is, start pretty loose!  If they leak a little, you tighten by quarter turns.  If you start off super tight, you can actually create a leak that way.

Make sure to mix some of the water from the box into the bag.  
And I'm pointing out that there guarantee has slipped, the order minimums have raised, and they're unbundling services.  That's not a matter of opinion, but public record.  \n\nAgain, I do the majority of my purchasing through Amazon, and have been a customer since 2003.  I don't know why you're defending them so much as a "marketplace seller," considering there was a recent article about Amazon poaching the most profitable drop-shipping opportunities and undercutting their marketplace sellers. 
When Amazon first started, it was 24 hours from order to shipping for 3-5 delivery OR 2 day delivery.  Now it's 7-10 days to leave the warehouse and 3-5 days shipping,  or 48 hours to leave the warehouse and 2 day delivery.   They don't need to compete anymore, and now their service is relatively sucky.  That's why monopolies are so toxic.

Again, I live 20 miles from the warehouse, so 10 days leaving the warehouse is 10 days delivery. 
I accuse you of lacking objectivity, and you fly off the handle.  I guess you made my argument for me. 
>7-10 days to leave the warehouse? That is impossible if shipping via Amazon.\n\nlol, when was the last time you didn't have prime?  I cancelled for 2 months this year.  Of all three orders I placed, each finally got in the mail on day 10.   I live 20 miles from an Amazon warehouse.  The only reason to do that is to "punish" me for having cancelled my prime account.

PETA is an advertising agency in the business of making themselves money.  It's the same as Pink Ribbon who "raises awareness" for breast cancer.

Heads Up:  Any company that feels you have access to sensitive data/systems that you might steal or fuck up, will same-day walk you out of the building. 
Regardless, it was an example of how Amazon has reached marketplace dominance and their services have declined in quality because of it.  I still prefer them over most local big-box stores, though.  So I don't think that Amazon getting into the shipping container business is going to be any good for us.  
>The fact that you still use them should tell you something - that their services haven't even declined enough for you to hate them.\n\nWhat are my other options?  Wal-mart...? it isn't hard to compete with wal-mart on an ethics or service level. \n\nYou are saying, "You use Amazon out of choice."  I am saying, "Amazon has marketplace dominance.  They don't need to compete."

>Is it really this hard to find people who don't leave things til the last minute?\n\n\nYes. Sadly.  I'm a person who floated through Highschool because of an IQ around 145.  I bombed when I got to college, and a lot of this person's behavior sounds like mine.  He's going to need to change it, or fail out like I did. I eventually went back and got my degree, but I wish I had been disciplined from the start.\n\nI reiterate the last point, if he can't work with you on your schedule, politely turn him down.  Tell him you already were busy working, and now that you're done, you want to spend time relaxing.

They probably hate each other, but for the sake of this presentation, they're acting friendly.  Their more subtle body language is revealing the truth, while their practiced, controlled body language is giving the illusion of friendliness.  
Can't they just clone the data?  Or is their software that can detect a cloning attempt and scramble or something?  Even if there is, I have trouble believing the government doesn't have the ability to do an undetected clone of a HDD.

So, after seeing your posts a bunch, I finally watched that video... How did ANYBODY ever think that "wrestling" was remotely real?  
It's technically [cannibalism.](http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2015_24/624471/pizzahut-hotdogpizza-today-tease-150610_7413ec0f63b132f1b440384644b1d730.jpg)  
They're "creating" value for Prime.  If USPS 3-5 day always reaches me in 3 days, and 2 day always reaches me in 2 days, few people are going to pay $100 to save a day, especially in my region. \n\nI know how to tell the difference between 3rd party sellers and Amazon.  \n\nEven so, Amazon's old shipping timeline was advertised as 3-5 days. Now they advertise it as 7-10 days.  It used to be free shipping at $25, now it's free shipping at $50.  Even if you don't want to believe that the warehouse wasn't even fulfilling the orders until a week out, it's obvious their competitiveness has gone down.  Furthermore, you see this with them un-bundling prime with things like "Prime Channels,"  "Prime Pantry," etc.  (Recently they directed me to a page with about 30 prime services I could pay extra for, don't remember them all).  \n\nI don't know why this is hard for you to believe.  This is the standard operation model for businesses for a long time.  Remember how cable television used to be all-inclusive and completely commercial free? 
Oh, DWS isn't incompetent at all, in fact she did exactly what she set out to do.  But I think Kim Jong-Un would have a problem rigging an election that Hillary could have won. She's rising because she can be neck-deep in shit, and people are still apologizing for her and whitewashing her.  
This is bad behavior/practices.  You have three choices that I can see.\n\n1) Deal with it as is (not recommended)\n\n2) Remove them from your life (may become necessary)\n\n3) Invite this person to study with you when you do the assignment.  If they work with you at that time, great.  If they say no then later need help, just politely say, "I invited you when I was doing the assignment, but I'm finished and would rather not go back to working on it. Try finding someone else who still needs to do it."
No offense, but I feel you lack a lot of objectivity and business practices understanding.  If you can't recognize textbook examples of consumer and business behavior, it really isn't my job to educate you.  You like Amazon a lot, I can tell.  But this isn't Amazon's subreddit for fanboys.  This is a place to discuss business.  
If you use Shellac, you want a TON of ventilation.  The amount of vapor is enough to start a fire in an enclosed space, and you don't want to be breathing it.  Do it outside, if you can.
Haha, oh man, that reminds me of the time a neighbor was smoking joints in his private laundry room.  All the exhaust vents were connected to everybody's laundry, so instead of being sly (no smoking apartment), he made everybody's clean clothing smell like weed. 
Watch E-Bay, and make posts at buy sell groups like [this facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RPGsalestrades/) for your country. \n\nAs long as they never used it for resin and didn't store it weirdly (folded over), a mold used 100 times is identical to a brand new mold.  Because of this, used prices are like 80% of new prices, but the shipping should be cheap if nearby. 
Nope, I did blow on Monday.  The day after Monday is Tuesday.  #3daybender
Plaster is a mild chemical reaction that starts with a lot of water.  Resin is a strong chemical reaction with no water. It gets quite hot, and also pulls some moisture out of the mold.  Each time this happens, the mold gets a little drier and more brittle.  Done properly, it will retire a mold after 50-70 casts.  Done improperly, it will retire a mold after a dozen casts. 
I need to build a transportable wooden podium/pedestal [like this](http://cdn.artistsupplysource.com/images/P/xctmp4H7ndS.png) about 4' tall.

You slide those hooked pieces down, and gravity keeps them there.  Is that something that already exists?

I sent in a complaint, they apologized and gave me like $5 off towards prime pantry, lol.  \n\nIt's just programmed into their shipping algorithm.  I have no doubt they "hold onto" non-prime orders for a minimum extra days.  That's what I mean by punish you.  
Dem's narrative is that TYTs are an extremist not-even-news source and sadly, many people believe that.

I guess I was thinking more in terms of global warming.  If we're going to do something, it needed to be 30 years ago, but the next best time is now.  The worst time would be in 4 or 8 years when we can get rid of this psycho. 
You are treating cops as a homogeneous group.  A blue-state cop is probably not violating people's rights. It's that blue-state cop that would also be the one who'd consider protesting.  So you're suggesting all good cops go get themselves fired, which will only leave behind bad cops.  \n\nYes, there are many, many authoritarian, shitty cops.  But I'd prefer the good ones stay where they are and influence the agency from within.

These towers usually had a ladder to the very top, with a trap door in the middle.  You couldn't have stairs on one side, or you wouldn't be able to stand there and shoot your bow.  I'm sure the model recognized that fact, but skipped over adding the detail.  
My tips for bringing this more in line with KD's style. \n\n1. It's too bright and colorful.  Pick one color, everything else should be black and white. Use a heavy black ink.\n\n2.

That's not a fire pit, that's a circle of rocks.  Relocate it 20' away from a tree, vertical or horizontal.

The instructions I used were digging a hole in the center you filled with gravel.  That lets air get to the bottom of the fire for a relatively-smokeless firepit.

No, pressure chambers are what the more serious people use.  I think the pressure actually forces the resin into the corners and pushes out the air.

So it's a piece titled, "Speculation that Hillary has Parkinsons" which a lot of people were speculating.  He talks about why people think that.\n\nThen his point is, "It doesn't matter if she's got a health condition, the problem is they are lying about it." His evidence for that is the changing and contradictory statements about her health.\n\nIt seems like the same conversational news piece on the same subject I saw on every news channel, except the few that were just promoting Hillary 24/7.

Getting rid of winner take all would be good. Or in lieu of that, I'd be happy with a change to make the number of Congressional seats and electors actually based on population, so a person in Wyoming doesn't have three and a half times the voting power as a person in California. Or ranked voting would be cool. Or Just a flat popular vote. Pretty much anything other than this nonsense that allowed Bush and Trump to win with less support than their opponents. 
That may be true, but the accusation I was referring to was when Trump said "He is the founder of Isis, he founded Isis" and goes on to also blame Hillary as co-founder. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjlorYteUsA\n\n
Book six is supposed to come out late this year! So you know - just a few more years of waiting till it's actually done!\n
Just one day? Who is OP, snoop?
I'm pretty sure anything with more than 140 characters counts as a book, and therefore he has not read. 
Yes the old timer was fine - time for both counter building and or jump parties. Plz Hirez
Yah, small pox was a bitch, but it wasn't just some natural spread of diseases - they were often spread intentionally. IIRC President Andrew Jackson and General Winfield Scott killed loads more people with forced marches and intentionally pox-infected blankets than with bullets. 
It is known.
Don't confuse the loud college liberals you see on social media with "the left" in general. That's really no better than what we're making fun of ITT
even then, sometime there's only 1 guy who has knowledge and or access to the back end of the POS. If he happened to not be there, or be busy doing something else... Maybe they were about to sell those to a catering event? I dunno but I always try to assume there's a good reason and not that people are just morons except me.
Jesus don't remind me of the specifics, that shit was horrific.
Well, its only a natural for a Snow to hate Sand I guess
Arguably Pence
What kind of sicko would piss on a hooker?\n\nI thought they were supposed to pee on us.
Looks like a lot of those comments got down voted into oblivion.
Yeah! Take that, all you people from broken homes!
Great point, if we were talking about a totally different topic.
Yeah, using her arrows as melee weapons is super realistic. Definitely. 
I guess what I'm trying to say is: Look, lots of people have had the same series of thought you're having right now. You're not wrong that life and suffering are inseparable. It's what you do with that information that matters. You can either sink into a 'everything is horrible and nothing matters' way of thinking, or accept the knowledge that the cosmos doesn't give a shit about you, that there is no God with a plan for your life, and become free by that knowledge. Now instead of just doing what God has laid out for you, you are able to do whatever give your life meaning and exercise your free will, to explore the unfathomable depths of your own consciousness. The fact that there is no purpose to life can be an excuse to just sit static and be miserable, or it can inspire you to make life what you want it to be.
quit ordering well done\n\nEDIT lazy and misread your comment. Carry on.
Enjoy a life of bitter resentment and anger then. I wasn't talking about head-in-the-sand brand happiness, I'm talking about mental health and not being a sad sack of shit and infecting everyone around you with cynical and fatalistic "we'll we might as well all just kill ourselves" type thoughts. 
In the states at least, these things are called asp batons rather than truncheons. I combed through these comments looking for an asp baton joke. Was so disappointed. 
North Florida is basically southern Georgia, but Miami is northern Cuba + all the things everyone hates about New Jersey.
Hey man, growing a spine is hard work.
Yeah Florida is diverse as fuck - but people just can't get over the 'Florida Man' image of white trash people smoking meth and being crazy... Probably because its funny, and its easy and feels good to shit on people you've never met. \n\n It's the third most populous state, and there's huge diversity in race, education, political ideologies, etc. The guy who left the comment we're replying to straight up admitted in another comment that he just doesn't give a shit about all these nuances, he is comfortable tossing the baby out with the bathwater and just saying "Fuck Florida" as if it were a monolithic symbol for everything evil or Trump-ish. I'm paraphrasing. 
that being said, It's important to remember context and the political climate. Lots of people are afraid that White Nationalism is being normalized in the U.S. right now - so obviously lots of people who are casually commenting and not paying real close attention are going to make assumptions. It would be clearer to refer to what we're talking about as Patriotism or Love of Country. It's like how people don't understand the difference between Democratic Socialism and Stalin / Castro style Socialism. You can try to educate people on the difference, or just call it something else so you don't confuse people. Either way, people will almost always go out of their way to misunderstand you on reddit. That's just how the cookie crumbles. 
I would give my left nut to swap Trump for Ryan, and yes I know how bad Ryan is. 
Perhaps its like Canadians and Tim Horton's - it's not that it's good coffee, its just everywhere. I don't go to Publix deli because it's amazing, I go because there's a Publix every few miles so I'm always passing one. 
So a few weeks ago I learned that those patches wont work if the screw is too close to the corner of the tire. I thought I was going to get away with the 25$ patch job, but I had to get a whole new tire because the screw was right on the corner : (
Right, because I'm sure you never voiced dissent or dissatisfaction in the past 8 years against Obama. Get off the high horse and ease up on the shooting you in the head talk bro.
They did a number on Gaddhafi, that's for sure. 
Hey look it's venom causes hemorrhaging of internal organs. Pretty gnarly.
... or maybe had hard boiled eggs or something with onions for lunch. More likely Satan though.
Partisan hacks are gonna do their thing, they don't give a fuck about America just scoring points against the other side. \n\nThe same people who accused Obama of being a dictator for signing executive orders only a few months ago are now applauding Trump's executive orders and therefore either only have the memory span of a goldfish, or perhaps they are just comfortable with double standards and inconsistencies as long as it benefits their team. 
I'm pretty sure with 3 million more votes its safe to say she lost because of the electoral college system, not because her policies were disliked any more than Trump's. 
Lol, over? Now its beginning my friend.
If the system said they were out, she might not have been literally able to ring that item up. Some of those POS systems can be a real POS
Judges have a liberal bias!\n\nEDIT sarcasm guys, wtf, don't you get context?
Are you really suggesting that a"family portrait" style picture of all 2000 vets who've signed up would be the only proof of their existence? \n\nI check other sources. You wait till the picture book version of the news comes out. I'm sure that'll happen any day now. Your comment history is hilarious btw thanks for that.
>Why can't we just say being a white supremacist makes you a racist?\n\nYou can\n\n>Why bring nationalism into it?\n\nI was simply answering this question. "So can a person be a nationalist who happens to be white but not a white nationalist?" asked by /u/Dowdly. \n\n>It is just a reaction against new branding of white supremecists or what?\n\nI have no idea what this is supposed to mean.\n
Also the dragons are way too small for her to already be on the throne. Those things are like book / season 2 size.
850 REPRESENT
And the topic was anti-white sentiment. WTF does any of this have to do with what we're talking about?\n
You'd punch a 130 year old? Wow brave guy right here.\n\nJK, but seriously why does reddit flip its shit about every animal related sob story? \n\n\nThere are way more "This ruined my day" comments in here than in loads of threads about kids being killed in drone strikes or threads about unarmed and fleeing people getting murdered by police, prisoners being abused and murdered by corrections officers, etc.
He clearly said in Florida, what does freakin Jersey have anything to do with anything?
YOU WOULD TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT THAT, WHAT ARE YOU SICK OR SOMETHING YOU MONSTER?
One state? What are you smoking and can I have some please? She got 3 million more total votes (and I promise you those weren't 'Illegal' votes like Trump says they were.) Acting like she won 1 state with 100% of that state's vote and and Trump won 49 with 100 of those state's vote is wildly inaccurate and misleading. \n\nShe lost choice battleground states like Florida, Michigan, etc by very small margins. Why are you glossing over the 48 or 49% of people who voted for Clinton in red states? I'm not disputing that Trump won. He just doesn't have the mandate that you are saying he has. His approval ratings are tanking fast and he's only in his second week. He has no mandate. 51% disapproval rating is not a mandate.\n\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/politics/trump-approval-rating-quinnipiac-poll/\n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx\n\nEDIT: Added a sentence and a couple of links 
Not speaking about laws, rules, or whats right - but she's basically the First Lady. God knows Melania sitting in Trump tower isn't.
Maybe no one had an elephant gun handy - if you think hanging is cruel, try killing an elephant with a gun made to kill humans. 
Dude it snowed in Tallahassee once, I almost made a whole snowball from all the snow in the yard.
I said people have such great empathy for animals and its sad they don't extend a similar affinity for other humans. What a controversial thing to say right? Threads about some Syrian kid dying usually devolve into political bickering and calloused dismissals of the kid's worth and value based on where the kid was from. When its an animal from a century ago everyone's got plenty of feelings. What snowflakes. 
I was actually going to use that as an example of how stupid of an idea this is - then thought better of dropping a LOTR reference in a GOT sub.
Its also the age of assumption and logical fallacies. You think its fine to assume the worst, and to assume what people mean without them ever saying it. Most arguments I get into on reddit tend to go like this:\n\n1. I say a thing.\n\n2. Someone replies with a series of wild accusations and condemnations of positions that I never took - and on topics that were never brought up.\n\n3. I attempt to get them to understand that I never said any of the bullshit they are ranting and raving about. I suggest to them that assumptions aren't helpful or constructive and only serve to further alienate people and obfuscate issues and create a toxic environment where people don't even want to engage with other people anymore.\n\n4. They call me a cuck or something and  move on, obviously learning nothing. \n\nSomeone said "Solidarity", and you were the one who added the vitriol and the division. They said nothing against you, or white people but you just want to play the victim. That's on you, and reflects YOUR thoughts and feelings, not the person who made the comment. \n\nYou can act like Christianity and white culture are being rejected as a whole, but that's ridiculous. White culture is not under attack, white supremacy is showing its ugly head and people are reacting to that.
I already miss having an adult in the White House, sure... But Obama was definitely not perfect. There are long lists of valid grievances and complaints about Obama - but they don't include a. being Muslim / from Kenya b. being a dictator (remember literally a few months ago when Executive Orders were a dirty word in right-wing media?) c. Founding Isis d. Any of the other thousands of nonsense things that Fox or Breitbart would have you believe.
There is nothing in the comment you replied to that would suggest animosity towards white people.\n\nHow come you're this defensive over the word Solidarity? Why you get so triggered? You need a safe space from the concept of togetherness?
That's how you get pink eye!
Lots of folk hate their parents
Hispanic just refers to whether or not a country or individual speaks Spanish. 
So play with people from your friends list. When they try to call you out on something you can always be like "yeah what about three games ago when you fed your ass off?" People having a good game act like they've never had a bad game before, and if you're having a bad game, people act like you've never made a sick play before in your life. Playing with people you know allows both them and you to be more patient. "Well he's feeding now, but last game he carried us. Oh well."
Don't tell anyone - like the internet - but I intend to open an okonomiyakiya in the U.S. in the next couple of years.
Yeh, he is next in the line of succession after Pence.\n\nMaybe some Game of Thrones level shit will happen and we will end up with President Ryan.
I've lived in the swampy woods of Florida for decades - literally the only animal I'm ever worried about are water moccasins, because they are mean, territorial little fuckers, and will chase you. Rattlesnakes won't mess with you unless you literally step on them, plus they actively try to warn you away with their rattle noise. Never worried about gators or anything else, just those damned cotton mouths. 
Bro of course there is a right answer - it's called Bernie Sanders
Not unless she's got some gnarly wildling STDs.
When the Electoral College fails to do that next month, you won't really be able to make that claim anymore.\n\nEDIT: Well the systems were set up for that reason whether or not its effective I guess. It deserves a big asterisk in civics class text books anyhow.
I heard someone simply refer to him as "45" the other day 
You say that as if you're somehow protected from the effects and consequences of what's going on.
Massive? It's well below half. Have you ever been to Florida? \n\nWe have lots of rural districts, sure. There are also several highly educated college towns and cities with way higher population density.\n\nFlorida has a lot of African American and Latino people as well - and let's remember that not all white people are bumpkin rednecks either. The number is probably somewhere like 30% of Floridians are actually redneck. \n\nAlso I don't know what you mean by "ruling" the state - the people who actually run the state are Tallahassee politicians (who are far more whole-foods-shopping snobby suburban people, not rednecks).\n
> then our entire government is a fucking joke!\n\nWhat are you still in 2016? 
You're going to need to be a little more concise. I have no idea what you mean. 
Whats funny about a brutal civil war where family members slay their kin?
easily the best part of the concept
Yeh they filmed the next movie already and she's in it.
I love dogs. I hate these dogs.
Pretty sure I remember Stannis saying in the books that it comes in several colors in the quarries at Dragonstone.
Wow your comment is totally incoherent, I don't even know how to respond to it, because I have no idea what you're trying to say.\n\n3 million more voters went for Clinton - and even since then Trump's approval rating has fallen fast. Again, I'm not saying he didn't legitimately win. He won, but with less popular support. That is an important distinction from "landslide" like you say. You're saying he has a mandate from the People and I'm saying he absolutely does not. He didn't on November 4th and he certainly doesn't today. \n
> We do not speak of North Florida\n\nLiar\n\n
I just had the same thought. Then I remembered trump is all rhetoric and showmanship and zero substance, and then I wasn't surprised at all.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapping
I need to get the brand of clear-eyes he's using, because I actually look stoned when I'm stoned. 
Jesus. Fucking. Christ.
You're so close and yet so far from the truth.\n\nSure, the universe is indifferent and doesn't give a shit about you or me or anything. But you're taking it a step too far to include "...suffer and nothing else". That's a fatalistic and far too simple way to view the world, and thinking that way is just going to make you more depressed and despondent and miserable. \n\nWhen you can actually take a step back, get a larger perspective on life and start to appreciate the small things - fresh air, clean water, safety, shelter, privacy, etc, your satisfaction with life will grow immeasurably, regardless of whether you're suffering right now or not.
Yeah, some semblance of self awareness and a knowledge of basic logical fallacies is far too much to ask from some people I guess. False equivalence is so goddamn common.
I love the emergency room analogy.
If your neighbor's dog bites you, (and the authorities find out about it) they will most likely put that dog down, particularly if its a breed of dog that could potentially maim or kill an adult human. Obviously hanging is crazy but this was literally 101 years ago and maybe they didn't have an elephant gun. My point is that people don't seem to give two shits about their fellow man, but go ape shit over some poor animals. That is a strange misplacement of empathy if you ask me.
Yeah except the 48% of Florida voters who didn't. But what's nearly half? Basically nothing right?
I literally yelled that exact thing at some dogs in my yard the other day and thought to my self "when did I become an old redneck dude?"
Compared to how she's described in the book? Absolutely not. GoT Brienne is just a very tall and somewhat masculine looking woman in armor. The actress is actually quite beautiful. ASoIaF Brienne is horse-faced and generally super repulsive.

I would literally kill for a notebook with that design printed on the front for all my recipies. I'm a professional cook though, so I would need like a real spine book styled one, not just 48 pages. I must find some kind of company that will do this for me! Thank you for the inspiration! 
Perfect 
You're an amazing person. Thank you for being you.

I have a kitchenaid pro 600 and I was struggling to change gears correctly. My fiancé opened up the motor compartment and it turned out the the speed control board had some how fried inside. Bought a new one off Amazon for around $30 and he rewired it in. Never worked better than now!

Ok I so need one of these!
It's absolutely beautiful! I'm normally not one to fawn over black and grey tattoos, but I just love this! Love the idea that it's of your wedding bouquet too!
I.... didn't need to know that.... Now I'm sad..
I did not know about this, but I must have it!
You are a great person. Please don't ever forget that.
Exactly! If a man who took up politics as a hobby last year can defeat an established Democrat that has been doing this for the last 30 years, anything is possible! 
Love the guys at Black Anchor. Jamie Schene did my leg piece. So much talent in that place! Looks great by the way.
Are you in the United States? 
I got so tired of having to deal with litter box I just stuck it outside and within two days my cat figured out "Hey if I'm going to the bathroom outside in a litter box, the whole world can just be my litter box."  Haven't had a litter box in over 5 years and my cat is super happy because he found them gross anyways.
The cookies look beautiful by the way!
This is how we got our dog. The shelter was running a free adoption day so we figured we would put the money that we would have spent on the adoption on getting extra toys, beds, what have you. We went there a couple days before hand and fell in love with the sweetest Labrador. Ended up getting him, but not on the free day. We still completely spoil him, but he's totally worth it.
Clear piping gel for sure.
Halloweentown was my favorite! I can't believe I never realized that was her!
I never even thought of that! Thanks for the idea!
Thanks for the information! 
Legally you can not ship food through the mail if you are operating under cottage food laws. People you see selling online are either working from a commercial kitchen, have zoning laws that allow them to certify their kitchen as a commercial kitchen, or are just doing so illegally. Counties have been known to check cottage food holders social media to see if they advertise that they ship, and can pull their license if they catch them doing it. 
What I would give to live there! That walk way though! 
Absolutely love this!
My boyfriend has a pair of pedals similar to that on his bike, and yea he has definitely gone close to the bonne on a really bad crash. 
My thoughts exactly!  The tiny details in the back are ridiculous! 
You actually made me laugh out loud with this. 
These are so cute! What pattern did you use?
I instantly read that in song form. Thank you.
She deserves to be the one to "shatter the last ceiling".
This is what is wrong with the world. I don't care who you voted for, that is just fucked up. No one deserves that.
Here's to 2020!

Yea with mine the speed control lever on the outside was having a super hard time switching through 2-4. And then sometimes get stuck around 7. It would take a lot of effort to get it to go through all the speed, though the machine itself never made any weird sounds. My fiancé said that it wasn't too hard to figure out how to replace the speed control. He said the new one was a lot stronger looking made, however it did require it to get rewired because the wiring has changed between then and now. Still though a $30 fix is not too shabby in my opinion. 
Absolutely beautiful!  I love the colors and have never seen a moth like this before. Do you mind if I ask why that particular design in relation to Rome? Are those moths common there? Love the way it kinda match your other one by the way.
We will not yield!
Thas a cool back story. Honestly this is the first time I've ever seen a moth tattoo and thought wow I think that's actually prettier than a butterfly tattoo.
What a wonderful husband and invention you have there! 
Love this! One of my favorite episodes! 
Nothing made me quite as sad as driving through Yosemite for the first time and seeing all the signs along the road from where bears got hit by cars. 
I just took a cookie decorating class and have extras that I don't plan on eating. PM me your address and I will send you some!
This is awesomely unique! Absolutely love!
Ok thanks for the advice. What is paper trading if you don't mind me asking.
Never took my sign down. But fortunately for me I have it in the window in the front of my place so it hasn't been weathered too bad.
I had the extreme pleasure of watching Tulsi speak in person at one of Bernie's last rallies. Listening to her speak gave me the same swell in my chest that I got when Bernie would speak. You can tell that they are both genuine people that just want what's best for America, not what's best for their political careers. Both of them would be amazing presidents. I'm hoping Tulsi will run in 2020.
That's why he picked him. Who's going to assassinate you if their next option would be Pence.
Damn! I forgot Brazile was still acting as the DNC Chair. 
I will usually spend somewhere around the $50 range. To be honest, I will sometimes base my gift on their level of thank you posts. If all they ever do is post a "Thanks Santa" when their santa clearly went above and beyond, or they don't even post any picture of their gift, I'm a little put off by it. I like it when people get excited to thank the random stranger that spent a lot of time figuring out something to get them. I also always message my giftee on matching day to say hi and let them know that they won't get shafted. It's also a great way they can contact me if they need to inform me about anything.
My brother had the same rainbow bracelet with yellow phone cord when he was little! 
Also, try out different brands. In my experience Country Kitchen meringue powder is a million times better tasting than Wilton meringue powder.
I was at a baseball game when it was announced that Princess Diana died. I was little and had no idea who she was at the time. I remember sitting there and we all had on our radio headsets on (they were a promotional give away from a game earlier in the season so a lot of people were wearing them) when they announced it. Suddenly several adults nearby started talking in sad and almost hushed voices looking around at each other. Then the whole section we were sitting in went quiet. They announced it over the intercom to the whole stadium and suddenly the game halted and everyone got quite. It was the first moment of silence I had ever seen/participated in and it there was probably 30,000+ people at the game. It was a sureal experience. 
Yea, royal icing.
Great detail! Love how talented all the guys at Black Anchor are!
Love this set!
I'm in California and here you can buy a cottage license to sell directly to consumers, or you can literally pay double the price and have someone come out to your house and inspect your kitchen so you can get a cottage license to sell to other businesses, but STILL can't sell through the mail. It literally makes no sense other than for the government to make a bunch of money.
Oh I'm all over my local elections, this is more in reference to new president and all. Glad I'm not the only one telling everyone to get out to their local elections everytime I hear 2020 mentioned! :)
They are banana flavored?! I have honestly never even tried one.
I'd like statistics on this. Not because I agree or disagree, but because I genuinely don't know. 
The reason why I keep gifting despite sometimes getting shafted is because people like you. Christmas can be a hard time for me as well, so I like to think that my giftee might be having the same hard time and do everything I can to make them smile. For me it's not so much about getting the gifts, as it is seeing my giftee's reaction post. Though I must say my arbitrary day santa spoiled me with an air brush and compressor for my cookie decorating, so I really feel the need to send the karma back out there. I did make my santa send me their address so I could send them some custom thank you cookies though. To me it's all about making other people feel happy.
Sad to see so many posts from people that have had bad experiences. This is always something that I look forward to and am a little bummed that I will be camping on matching day so I might not have enough reception to stalk my santa right off the bat.
Glad I'm not the only one with this as my first thought.
I must go to this store. Purple is my favorite color and this just seems right up my alley!
Make the pies, let them cool down in the fridge till they are fully set, wrap them in plastic wrap a couple of times and place them into an air tight container, then freeze them. Pull them out day of and let thaw in the fridge (night before if you do thanksgiving really early in the day), they will be just fine.
I totally feel yea. I work as a pastry cook for a hotel and we make stuff in advance and freeze it if necessary. There is seriously no problem with freezing food at all as long as you wrap it properly. 
Thank you for just being you. The world need more people like you.
This is so beautiful. Thank you for sharing this. Who is it by?
The cheap brands, yes. Some of the higher ends brands that most home bakers don't use, no. But fondant is also meant to be used rolled super thin, and most times people end up rolling it out too thick, so that doesn't help.
I feel like I'm only a great Santa because right at the very beginning of my gifting experience I got shafted in the bookmarks exchange and had the most amazing, wonderful rematcher ever that made me strive to be like them.
Oh man I didn't hear of mods getting paid off. Damn. Kinda makes sense when you think about it. 
I have the 6qt. Kitchen Aid and have had my eye on these since they came out. I love my 6qt. But sometimes it's too big to do smaller batches and things in. Hopefully they will drop the price cause it seems weird to me that the 3.5 qt mini cost more than the 6qt.
Do you have to put each tissue in by themselves?  How does it work? This is by far the cutest thing I have ever seen!
Uggg unfortunately I will be on vacation when he comes within  a couple hour drive of me. Wish he was doing this on a different time. Maybe he'll do another one next year. One can only hope.
Was literally just at Michael's an hour ago and all their Crayola was 50% off! So now they are like normal prices...
Don't forget to check out the pound. Sddac.com is the animal control website and they will list photos of found dogs. After the animal has been in County Services for 7 days they legally become property of the county and can be adopted out.
Upvote for Lava-sagna
We will have to see. I've had it since '09 and this was the first issue I've ever had with it.
I would check out Costco if I were you. They usually have a couple of TVs that will have a manufacturer rebate on top of their sale price. We got a 48" (maybe a 50" dont remember) visio smart tv with the 2 year square trade protection plan and out the door with tax and the protection plan it was $442. Our TV isn't the 4k one, but I personally don't like the way they look. Something about the refresh rate makes everything so clear, it almost looks fake if that makes any sense. 
Out of curiosity why do you put corn syrup in your recipe. This is the first one I have seen with it and I'm wondering what kind of difference this makes.
I need this in my life.
Easily the best scene of the movie!
It feels good to be back with family.
I love how Bernie instantly throws a shout out to Keith Elison!
I certainly haven't! I remember people were looking at me like I was crazy when I told them that I was phone banking for Bernie for an hour or two every day after work and 6 hour shifts on my days off. They all looked at me like I was crazy when I would show them the polls of Bernie beating Trump in a landslide while Hillary barely scrapped by. These are the same people that would fight me about how she was much more "electable" and continue to fight me that my vote to the green party (in California I might add) cost her the election. Some people never learn. I for one will be phone banking like crazy for the 2018 midterms.
Yea, I'll be honest, as someone who has always wanted to get flower tattoos, I can't believe I had never thought of this idea either! Problem is, I want to get my tattoos before my wedding since they will be covering older tattoos that I would rather not have on my big day.
Love this!
This! At this point I no longer care why they shut us down, I just miss this sub. Please, we need this to help continue organizing for true progressives.
Thank you for posting this with the before and after shots. My mind is literally blown away at how such a heavy black tattoo was able to get covered with that beauty. I myself have a tattoo that has large chunks of black and have always been worried that I would only be able to get more large patches to cover it. This gives me hope.
Clever! 
Hold the phone here, your sister is sweetambs?! She is one of my cookie idols! 
Like what? 
Well at least it's technically accurate. 
I mean she married Bill. Had to have at some point! 
Answer is simple: treat yo self! 
I absolutely agree. That's why I mention him finding a woman who's into it herself.
I definitely didn't mean to imply it was easy. It takes work. Investing in yourself to become a more interest, compassionate, dynamic person it tough, but so rewarding. Allowing yourself to be polarizing, to experience rejection and celebrate it, and the honesty that requires is scary and tough at first 
Nasa had massive internal review and policy changes afterwards. They began calling themselves a safety first organization, and from what I understand these concerns tend to be take with much more gravity now. 
What the actual fuck. 
I need two more compelling pictures of Tulsi in different settings! Poster incoming! 
Is she bad at makeup? This is a legitimate question, if she doesn't get a lot of practice and avoids it, she could not know how to flatter herself well. Makeup is hard. 
<3 
It's a matter of efficiency. Making a new pie is much easier than overcoming the vast institutional resistances to a third party. Bernie ran as an independent most of his life -  don't you think that if he thought it could be done, he'd be doing it? 
I agree, I think it's an Appeal to Ridicule. Actual cases of trigger warnings getting out of hand are few and far between, in my experience. And even then, what's the harm? 
Can you go into more detail about how he wrote himself into the  a corner? I've read the first two books. 
No. To every bit of this: no. 
I feel like that's wrong, but I don't know enough to dispute it. 
So what about situations like California, where as of a recent party election 60% of the elected seats are people holding a position in  the party for the first time? Almost to a person they describe themselves as Berniecrats. 
True, but the woman he was talking about did wear it. 
You're right, my story ry is from after Columbia. 
I imagine you get less sore after doing  it for a month. 
He did reverse the scientific gag order the previous administration enforced on any scientists receiving public funding. This was because being honest about global warming could hurt the appearance of some of their big oil companies. So at least that is really good. 
I like your style. 
Climate skeptic does a disservice to the label of skeptic. Skeptics demand evidence and can be persuaded by it. \n\nThey're not skeptics, they're climate deniers. 
Yeah, thanks to the help of another poster I was able to see why I interpreted it differently: http://reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/5us0pr/some_of_us_prefer_to_forget_our_special_snowflake/ddwqvea\n\nWe all good now. 
This is a fair critique. 
Aw, the amount of trust she has is amazing. 
This muthafucka packing high grade heat! 
Petting stranger dogs without their owners can be scary to them if you approach it wrong, you can get bit. Don't lead with your hand, or lean your face toward them to start. Both can look aggressive to a dog, like a strike or incoming bite. No other species bares their teeth as a sign of friendliness. \n\nIf you are going to pet a strange dog, walk relaxed toward them, slowly into sniff range. When dogs meet, they sniff first if neutral or friendly, and make eye contact if aggressive or scared, so avoid holding eye contact until after you've had scent introductions. \n\nThen let them sniff the back of your hand. If they're relaxed and friendly it's a good sign, you've established a bit of rapport, and can get more touchy with much less chance of scaring the dog and getting bit. \n\nStay safe! 
You're making a lot of assumptions I'd like to challenge. I'm not justifying toxic masculinity, I hate it. I'm a huggy, touchy feely guy who struggles to connect with those who don't think they can hug or show any vulnerability. The sooner toxic masculinity dies, the better. \n\nWhat I take issue with is painting the whole gender that way. I can see how that wasn't clear in my comment, through. Whoops. 
FFS? 
Lots of respect, brother. \n\nMy part about "can't use your free speech to confront my free speech" is from 4 lines in the video: \n\n1. "not that pesky diversity of thought" \n1. "used to say I may disagree with what you say but I'll fight to the death for your right to say it" \n1. "Banning speakers you disagree with"\n1. "prohibiting any words that are not approved as politically correct" \n\nThere's a lot to break down here, but but what I see is a trend of painting disagreement as censorship. What's wrong with not having a speaker at your school who you think has destructive and harmful views? Were they advocating law changes to penalize the speaker? What about the progressive's attempts to create a cultural shift away from words suffused with hatred or factionism, Are they asking for police forces to enforce their views? That is what censorship is like. \n\nProgressives, the non extremists, are trying to exhert social pressure through expressing what they think is good and confroning what they think is bad. Why should they be expected to become a platform for those expressing values in opposition to theirs? Is any other movement having these expectations leveled at them?\n\nAnd that's the crux of it. I don't think this expectation is leveled in any major way at any other group. How many atheists do you see giving talks at Christian universities? It's nonsense to expect it of anyone, and the progressive movement being criticized for not living up to this fabricated and arbitrary standard is what I'm calling bullshit on. \n\nIn almost all of these cases the majority of progressives are not engaging in actual censorship. They're just attempting to exhert cultural influence the way every other ideology is. \n\nIt's a pleasure discussing with you. 
I can't call it's copyright and net neutrality effecting laws an improvement 
Agreed! Better to address criticisms than build an impregnable echo chamber. 
I'd say pick one that doesn't see pro play,  but isn't old or garbage. Like velkoz. But with the new 10 ban system and riot getting better at balancing for pro level champion diversity, that's not much of a option. \n\nThat said, Lee sin is fun as fuck and has been in the pro spotlight for so long that most of the changes that will happen to him have already happened, so he might be the best choice. 
I feel like I need context. 
Link? 
It's the rest of the video. Building speed for twelve hours to do parallel universe teleportation and realignment is pretty intense. 
Yup, I just woke up defensive today, I guess. My bad. 
Ah, I see! There was some ambiguity in his original post. Where you saw "no stupid manly rules"  as a narrowing of his criticism to toxic masculinity, I saw the "I've given up on friendship with men"  as applying the criticisms of toxic masculinity to the entire gender. But, as he clarified in a later post, you interpreted it the way he intended. \n\nThis makes a lot more sense now. Thanks! 
I like your sass. 
Yup, no woman could enjoy this process, and it's all the non-women's fault. And you can declare what people can do on their relationships. \n\nSeems about on par for internet logic. 
No sweat on the format, it's perfectly serviceable! Okay, got my screen split between two windows horizontally, one for reading and one for writing, and now I'm ready to dive in. :D\n\n>Role and value of labels\n\nAgreed\n\n>Left not respected free seech when it doesn't work in their favor: hold your own accountable\n\nI completely agree. This isn't "my tribe vs your tribe", it's "what ideas will help improve the quality of life of the citizens, stability of the world, improves the minmum standard of living of the world, and the strength of our government's global position while respecting human rights and privacy". So when individuals fuck up and get tribal I call them out. \n\n>Censorship is shitty\n\nYeah, unless it's on the "great firewall of china" scale, it seems mostly to have the barbra streisand effect.\n\n>Whether its a Trump supporter refusing to listen to the "insanity of an SJW snowflake libtard" or a left-winger resorting to name dismissing a conservative as a "racist sexist misogynistic homophobic white nationalist nazi" both sides are to blame\n\nIt's important to not just take a "everybody is bad" sweeping neutral gesture here though. Have you compared progressive subs like /r/nerdfighters, /r/feelthebern, /r/political_revolution, /r/tulsi, etc to what /r/the_donald has to offer? Is the difference in both frequency and vitriol of dismissive strawman attacks not glaringly obvious? I agree that people who label themselves progressive can behave just as badly at times, but frequency matters. \n\n>but liberals especially are quick to assign malicious intent and hateful opinions when the reality probably is that they are just misunderstanding or refusing to listen to an argument\n\nFortunately I don't seem to associate with many of those types. Not even by choice, I just haven't run into more than a few. But then, I never went to college on a liberal campus.\n\n> nearly a decade ago, when the last smolders of the authoritarian right were fading away. They are more or less dead now\n\nMaybe I'm unfamiliar with what you mean by "authoritarian right" is, but wasn't the tea party -- a much more recent phenomenon -- an example of something just as ugly surging up and influencing the majority of the Rs?\n\n> That being said, my point is still that this type of authoritarian silencing is perpetrated more by the left. \n\nThat's a good hypothesis, but we need to data to confirm it. You've given a lot of anecdotes, and they do help me get a better sense of where you're coming from, but we need numbers. For instance, "bans per student". So if a college has 1000 students and bans 1 speaker, it's .001 bans per student. We'd have to use this metric because liberal university tend to be larger and more common, so doing a "bans per university" wouldn't even give a proper read on the situation. And then we also have to remember that the available speaking venues for liberal minded speakers is great, and so they probably don't ask to speak at conservative universities as often. Since conservatives try to speak a liberal universities more, there's more opportunity for bad faith instances, and so will get denied more.\n\nIt's kind of like how the political party not in power can huff and puff on about how they'd run everything so much better: they're not the ones being exposed to the challenges and risks. Since liberal universities have more, even if their bad behavior was statistically identical to conservative universities, they'd still have more black marks on their record. I can be persuaded with data, of course, but I'm laying out the factors that need to be considered for a fair examination.\n\n> Once again, this kind of stuff hasn't been carried out by the right in a long time.\n\nThat is not true. Since the election of trump many have reported major increases in racism and sexism. [Republican Christopher von Keyserling sexually assaulted a woman saying,](http://www.refinery29.com/2017/01/136253/christopher-von-keyserling-grab-them-by-the-pussy) in regards to Trump's election, "it's a new world politically" and "I love this new world, I no longer have to be politically correct". [A vocal anti-immigration conservative shot up a mosque two weeks ago](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/31/americas/quebec-mosque-shooting/). I can link a lot more if you like.\n\nI don't know where you have this squeaky clean perception of the conservative right, but it's not true. I don't judge the majority of the right by these folks, mind you, but you can only claim the right doesn't have extremists is only true if you engage in No True Scotsman. And if you do that, I'll do the same, "no True liberal silences free speech" and "no True liberal beats people for their vote".\n\n> I think Dave Rubin's show is a great example of this working. He interviews liberals, conservatives, creationists and atheists in order for him and his audience to fully understand every side of a debate. I think this type of conversation is what we need to minimize the polarization that's taken over the country. \n\n"If you believe in free speech you're not progressive" is an ideological battlecry that leaves no room for subtlety. It's the kind of echo chamber fodder people will pass around because of the high of righteous indignation it gives to those who already agree with him. So if OP's video is representative of his work, no, he is not healing the divide.\n\nInstead, let me propose some videos I believe will do a much better job of reaching across the isle (assuming you haven't seen these already):\n\n* [Exhibit A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5DX4XqtUI) \n* [Exhibit B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJYTj-VI_L8)\n* [Exhibit C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnA9oA8Y1Y8)\n\nNone of these have the same idealogical battlecries or blatant attacking generalization that pocket OP's video.  Please take the time to watch these, they're all short and meaningful. Also, please link me to a video of Mr. Rubins that is a better example of his style, if OP's vid is not representative.\n\n>Interview and debate\n\nHell yeah! For debate form we cannot use what happens for presidential elections. I also think interviews are great ways of showing a range of views without endorsing them, the same way just giving a speaking platform is. As long as the interviewer isn't stirring up shit and is working to fairly demonstrate and challenge each person's views.\n\nFor debate, I think it has to be "Pick a topic, each person has a 15 minute speech on it, alternating. Then each have 6 minutes of response. Then there is a Q/A session which screened questions, 3 questions for each debater." This should keep the debate inside an hour, making it quick to consume. Have you seen a better format?\n\nBTW, I love it when I find someone who disagrees with me, will discuss with me, and is civil! Much good!
If I can give you some advice friend: find someone who's as excited about you as you are about them. Don't waste time trying to figure out how you should have molded your self to interest her more, nothing healthy lies down that path. \n\nInstead, grow who you are, grow in your interests, and then find someone who's enchanted by that. 
>1\n\nYes I know he was not saying he felt diversity of thought was pesky. As for your points, while I agree that can happen in the more clique-ish circles, they're not the majority I've experienced outside of college campuses. Most college folks are still tribal in their identity, it's a piece of human nature that takes a lot of time and effort to overcome. It's fine to criticize the adolescents and fringe progressives for their handling of this but to call the rest of the movement something to be abandoned over it? No. \n\nI know this is anecdotal, but my experience has been one of conservative Christianity, being very lost after I found I could no longer believe in  God, and then after studying I grew to become progressive. In my experience with progressives I've barely run into those with an "approved thought list"  but as ofmy reference point is Christianity that may be tinting my view. In contrast, in the progressive movement I've had people challenge my views and make arguments on why I should change them. And that is good shit. \n\nAs for listening with intent to learn, I believe every perspective exists on a spectrum from "shit worth listening to"  to "neonazi". I'm not obligated to sit and listen to a neonazi. Ideally myself and the neonazi can have a productive debate and we can grow toward peace and harmony. But I've only got so much time in a day, and so many days in my life. Unless I'm debating for a large audience that can persuade many people away from neonazi sentiment, I think it's a bad investment of my time. \n\nOn this spectrum there's a line, or rather a fuzzy gray area, where a perspectives go from "not worth the time investment"  to "maybe?".  I think this same thing is true for every ideology. Maybe that "maybe zone" should be more generous for some progressive, I'd also say that's true for every group, but it's not a reason to decry the whole movement. What he's doing here is just one step better than judging a group by its extremists, using a convenient scape goat to dismiss the sincere efforts and diversity of throught of an entire movement. \n\n>2 Authoritarian censors\n\nCan you show me the data your conclusion is based on? Fox News decried mass effect for being a sex simulator when it had a single scene less explicit and titalizing than most of fox's programming. They were hypocritical liars being alarmist and playing the narrative of scary new media for views. They were trying to give it an Adult Only rating which would pull it from the shelves of all major US retailers. I feel like I see this everywhere I look in conservative circles, which includes my entire extended family and first 24 years of my life. In my little corner of the world the difference is night and day between conservative and progressive handling of this kind of thing. But maybe I'm unaware of the larger progressive movement's persistent censorship efforts trying to get media banned? I can be persuaded by data, but without establishing progressivism as being as bad or worse than other common ideologies I won't be persuaded the progressive label should be abandoned. That'd be like convincing me to leave the most peaceful state because even though it had less murders than every other state, it still had murders. \n\n>3 \n\nI'm not actually super familiar with campus progressivism. If they are indeed quick to call a conservative a misogynist or white supremacist without evidence in an effort to get them banned simply becaus they don't like some of their economic views and such, then yeah, that's awful. But make sure the evidence actually supports that narrative. Imagining a negative trend where there are actually only a few extreme examples is no good. \n\n>Christian University \n\nI agree, they are a low bar. I was using them for clarity of contrast. \n\nSo my objective to letting anyone with a view not actively calling for the suppression of a minority speak is that by giving them the platform you are implying an endorsement. A student seeing a speaker on a stage is going to assume he's more worth listening to that if he was just on the street. Lending your university's prestige and platform,  and with the implicit approval and promotion, to an ideology you oppose feels immoral. \n\nBut I agree that banning brings a whole host of problems and is a generally bad solution for all but the most extreme views. So what about debates? Instead of hosting speakers, host debates? By doing this you can have diversity of thought with much less implicit support for an ideology you oppose, and the speaker doesn't get to control the narrative. \n\nThey can be even less debate-ish, and have two speakers give a talk back to back on the same topic, presenting a diversity of views. \n\nThoughts on this solution? 
Autocorrect on phone 
Oh is this the shit on men thread? I wanna join! 
Set the tone by being casual, he's more like to follow your lead, good or bad. 
Yeah I guess this forgot story cancer is not woman specific. 
So OP is a transman who's wearing a choker?
90% narrative peddling, 10% meaningful criticism.\n\nThe whole "you can't use your free speech to confront my free speech"  jig is wearing thin. Free speech does not = safe space for assholes. This is the same line of shit that the_donald uses to justify their extreme moderation while calling themselves a bastion of free speech.\n\nHe plays fast and lose with generalizations of a group, while criticizing generalizing. He uses Strawmen and is offended by trigger warnings... why? I think Appeal to Ridicule is why. \n\nAnyway, as for the legit criticism, I agree pc culture can get out of hand. Labels like sexist, racist, homaphobic, and islamaphobic can be thrown around in place of productive discussion. It's a trend we should resist, it's lazy, and it alienate those we need to make allies of. Put in the effort to explain why a given thing is harmful, build a bridge from their perspective to yours, rather than just slap a label on it and act like you've "won".\n\nBut most of the rest of his video is insubstantial and disingenuous. Judging a group by its radicals gets us nowhere, it's the very first thing you must not do to have a productive dialog. He paints the narrative that politics used to be a glorious era of battling ideas and honesty, and just now it's become about emotion. That this is a new degenerate wave corrupting a glorious past. What world does he live in? Has he studies political history at all? Rose colored hind sight is such a common malady among critics of the progressive movement. \n\nThis is mostly world view affirming echo chamber fodder, not an attempt to have a legitimate dialog. 
I'm going to need a walkthrough on the meaning of this title.
If we improve the mind machine interface and learn how to migrate consciousness onto silicon in your lifetime, you'll be able to do that and then just dial back your anxiety value. So that'd be nice.\n\nNot sure that thought helps though... 
I think if you boil it down maybe you can get less blank looks? "You only win when you persuade", or, more true but less pithy, "You only win when both of you believe the most compelling argument for sound reasons." That second one take a bit more to parse though.\n\n>The very simple act of listening and acknowledging what someone else has said has astounding consequences.\n\nYeah, listening, and if you interlocutor is arguing in at least half good faith, praising their good points and recognizing the pain or fear they're experiencing (without belittling). Another good play is to describe what would be required to convince you, such as data. This leads by example by showing openness to them, empathizing with them, and putting science and studies as the arbiter of whats to be believed, rather than emotional rhetoric.\n\nThis doesn't work with everyone, some people are too deep in the emotional rhetoric. But for many, and for those watching, it's an extremely powerful position.
That was pretty great. 
Well, hopefully. Realignment is a bitch. 
Pretty sure there will always be limits.

In the Democratic, you take delegate proportional to the amount who voted for you, win or lose. \n\nThis means for the Republican primary, if you have 5 guys most people like, and 1 that is generally unliked but very different, the majority will split their votes between the 5 guys. This makes none of the 5 win, even though the majority would have preferred any one of them to win before the oddball candidate. \n\nFirst past the post is the voting system America uses and its terrible. https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo\n\nApproval Voting or Score Runoff Voting would be soooo much better at getting the candidate most people actually want elected. http://www.equal.vote
Real talk: it's a mix. Having food makes you happier. Being out of the cycle of poverty makes you happier. Statistically, money is likely to make you happier up to 70k yearly salary in the US. Above that it all seems about attitude and perspective. \n\nDon't get me wrong, above starvation attitude makes a huge difference, the difference between a joyful life and misery. But pretending things don't help up to a certain point is disingenuous. 
Oh cool! I had to do this with my mom back in the day, too. She was raised in a... Much less lovely environment. 
I feel like you're assuming a lot of maliciousness that, to be fair, could be there. It just wasn't something I was assuming. I thought it was mostly about the licking part of play, not all affection and touch. \n\nIf your assumptions are correct, I agree and he needs to grow up. \n

Heh, speaking of idea censorship... [a misuse of rule 19 by the republican congress to silence Elizabeth Warren disputing the confirmation of Jeff Sessions and Attorney General.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/elizabeth-warren-silenced/)\n\nNot that CNN is my favorite news source, but its good for a story here and there.
Do you understand the spoiler effect? I agree we need more diverse options, but it's not happening until we replace fptp.

Hm, in what specific way are you referring to when you say "this"? 
I'm delighted to see this clarification. Criticizing toxic masculinity does everyone good. Blaming it on men in general does very little good. 
It's a spell that's calling us higher... Trumps ridiculous ban is so shameful. 
"Shitting on the social construct of social masculinity" is something we can all get behind, but it's a rather generous interpretation of his post, no? I mean, he later clarified, but it was a necessary clarification. 
I really haven't had this problem with Google Play Music. You make Playlist and listen to it like normal or generate a radio based off it. Down vote what you don't like, no problem. The preferences don't carry between Playlist, either, so you can dislike a song for one radio and not another. 
What explains his oversized suit coats and ridiculous tie length?
I don't understand the first half of your post. You imply that I think free speech only applies to my side, and that I want to silence the opposition. Where did you get that from in my post? \n\nThe second half of you post is mostly repeating my rebuke to those who use phobia labels in place of actual persuasion and argument, no? \n\nIt looks to me like you've made a strawman to tear down and then repeated a point at me to appear on a moral high ground. But I don't want to make that conclusion without ruling out some better, more charitable interpretation. Since it's been along day I can't think of one at the moment, I'll wait on your clarification. I do believe you can teach me something here. 
I think Milenda played a large roll it getting him interested in philanthropy. That's why I always remember to mention her when talking about what the Bill and Milenda Gates Foundation does. 
Alright, walk me through the stupidity. How is he not a perfect gender swap of the linked comic?

I feel like I should put a teddy in my glove box, and just avoid shoving my foot in my mouth. 
What movies are you guys watching?
I feel like attraction to long, healthy, fit legs was genetically selected for as our ancestors left the tree. Those Who could chase, flee, migrate and persistence hunt better had a better chance of their kids surviving. Those who we happened to be attracted to those kinds of legs had more grand children. 
Maybe he's not holding all women to that standard. Maybe he just wants to find a woman who's into being shaved, and they can celebrate and fulfill their preference together. It's not like he's making law here. 
Yeah they fucked up on him. But that was the class team, not the champion rework team. The difference in resources they can commit to one  champion is huge, and I don't think the class team has skarnered anyone else. When they did a postmortem on the juggernaut class rework, which was their first, they pointed out a ton of their failings, skarner among them. \n\nThe Marksman rework was pretty good, and the Mage update was good overall and great in some aspects. I think they're getting better at this, so I can forgive them for early foibles. 
Your stance is totally reasonable and fair, I completely agree. \n\nThe difference between you and the guy I replied to is you're criticizing a specific behavior and specific people, where his was just broad beam shade at the whole gender. It's the difference between saying "I hate how men do X"  and "I hate it when men do X". The first shames the gender, the second shames the action. \n\n
Homoflexible? 
I'd still like to continue this conversation if you do. What are your criteria for determining if an actor generosity is superior? 
I appreciate the in depth reply. 
Doing it right! 
Beliefs are something you choose and are capable of making meaningful statements about your person. So the opposite of "color of skin" judgements. 
What about the rework diminishes your enjoyment? 
Yeah, it's not like Milenda drug him in by the ear. 
You bet friend. I'm going to pm you some additional advice that may help with this two.

Wow, you're a cheap and shoddy little asshole. That's all I have to say to you.
This is the best answer so far to this question, I think. And even though it pretty much sidesteps the original question, it made the most sense to me, though as I understand it you're advocating a pretty different way of looking at things than what the bible asks...
Interesting note, aside: I have noticed often that from the outsiders point of view, certain decisions seem simple. "Why didn't they just turn left?" "Why didn't they just leave?" But this ignores all of the interlocking and interdependent factors that make a human life and a human relationship. The factors that connect & lock us to other people... who is to say how layered or interconnected a choice may be in any relationship. Love, security, history, future considerations... all must be factored in and its never as simple as why didn't they just choose "X".   ...Which may seem to have been the obvious choice from the outside or after the fact.
Wow, Toyota Prius Prime is so edgy and counter culcha.
Ok, I'll reply...  Can you tell me why I would call you a 'cheap shoddy asshole' for making such a comment? If you can give me a few thoughts on why you think I'd say such an awful thing then I'll discuss it with you. And for the record, I haven't downvoted you yet.
Because a lot of things are pretty shitty lately?  \n  \nYou don't get out much, do you.
I disagree. It is a cause and has to be considered as such in considering what tendencies and directives it gives to us. Whatever you may or may not think is the "root" of the cause there is no doubt that in addition to encouraging some good religion has also been responsible for encouraging a whole lot of bad, and we can't deny this and pretend its otherwise.  \n  \nThe point of the posts is that we are ready to move past religion as an arbiter of our society, and holding on to religion holds us back, and when you consider what religion has given us in the past and where it wants to move us currently i think the case is clear- modern society has a better chance of being a fair and equitable culture without religion.\n  \nEDIT: If you disagree use your words, like big kids...\n
Another stupid asshole makes another stupid statement.
 And here I thought punishments were discussed AFTER the evidence had been presented and found to be honest and conclusive. Silly me, there I am going on about the OLD rules for the OLD world...  We're going to war, aren't we?
Yes, that coincides with every piece of evidence related to the Wikileaks mission statement. \n  \nThe info is being leaked about powerful people who apparently will say anything to hurt Wikileaks and stop further releases, because anti corruption is apparently not anti american.  \n  \nThe questions arise when people start asking why he only released Democrat party information., which as he says is all they had to release.
How did you get that wacky font in there?  \n  \nAnd... I hope someone is keeping an eye on this guy.

Let's start talking about "crosscheck" and then I'll be more open to hearing about this
The problem with this guy is that he's personalizing his politics. If he was truly "left" and cared about the issues the  true left wants to engage in and promote then he wouldn't care about "personal attacks" or a few arguments with shallow "friends". He'd have done his research and know his issues.\n\nThe trouble is that it seems he sees his own personal involvement in and position within the political effort entirely through the lens of the identity politics that ultimately represents nothing. And now in his "switch" he's become, un-ironically in his own mind, the poster-boy for the failure of identity politics... So much so that he can now identify with a political movement that represents the opposite everything he previously thought he cared about. \n\nThe "left" has be more than just shallow image manipulation and eating lifestyles, it has to be an ideology to promote real issues. Otherwise it continues to be as vacuous and shallow as this guy's political stance, whatever it happens to be today or tomorrow or the day after that.  \n  \nEDIT: As a follow up to this note, in response to his comment "And I feel more welcomed on the right now that it's happened." I'd like to read his column the day after he gets his ass kicked at a southern republican convention. Will it go something like "I am writing this column as a return the liberal party..."
And the fuck, fuck, fucking fuckery fuck thing about it is that it means she's most definitely still wiggering her little fingers around in the DNC. The lessons people like her learn from failure, after so much success, is that they didn't do what they were doing well enough, that time.  \n  \nFuck.
You scare me. Its crazy letters like this combined with user names like yours that often predicts violence.
"Abuse is terrible" says the person who has no fucking idea what they are talking about, said with the same tone as stubbing your toe is painful but..."
It's very obvious they have no replacement plan. If they did they would be screaming it out.

So the real problem is accountability and regulation. We need to take the private out of healthcare.   \n  \nThat was the major failure of the ACA, and I think this was well understood at the time it was implemented, was that it delivered bodies to the mill but gave no controls for oversight to limit the gouging that private monopolies always implement. The failure of the ACA was not that it was too public, but that it remained too private.  \n  \nAny government is an engine for management. The problem with the gov in the USA at this point is that it has been captured by private & corporate interests, and THAT is why it does not work for the people. It works very well for those who control it, and is why we have crap like the ACA where many other countries provide affordable, gov run healthcare for their citizens.
So why would that be an issue for you?
It's these insightful comments on these topics I come here to read.
If a person could split the moon, that sure would be incredible. And then to stitch it back together again with no detectable trace, well that would be something indeed. As far as I can see there is zero evidence that this happened, only words in a book, stories from the Stone Age.\n  \nSo the question then becomes not "do you believe in miracles" but "how do you want to base your decision making process, on words from old books that have zero connection to observable and testable history for as long as we've been able to accurately record it, or on information that is tested and verified by generations of observers and is repeatable by yourself?" Or even more simply put, "do you base your belief system on what you see or what you WANT to see?"\n  \nI know my answer, I encourage you to rise above basing your worldview on stories that are completely disconnected with any verifiable truth or evidence.
The people who blather on about "taxation is theft" try very hard to ignore one main point: They can't extricate themselves from having benefited from the system. They ride on publicly maintained highways, they visit state parks, their children attend publicly funded schools & universities, they have the support of the fire & police depts, turn on lights & water and flush toilets that are maintained and supported by public utilities...\n\nEscape clause... Well this may work in part until something goes bad. Like the man who opted out of pay taxes related to firefighters and thought it was great until his home burned down.\n\nhttps://usnews.newsvine.com/_news/2011/12/07/9272989-firefighters-let-home-burn-over-75-fee-again\n\n
I think the evidence is clear in the modern world which direction religion is pushing us, and its clearly not toward scientific advancements. Religion in its modern form is at its core about control - of political directions and of personal morality - its not concerned in any way about scientific advancement.  \n  \nThere is no need to look to the past or even consider historical evidence in this matter, we only need to look at policies and attitudes of christians in our day to day efforts.
Ah yes, Booker's point about the saftey of items from Canada is only taken if you completely ignore that Canada has solid saftey standards and there are no safety issues with drugs in Canada. When you factor that in it becomes, well, bullshit.
> I think morals are more related to decisions that impact others rather than yourself.  \n  \nThe decisions on how to govern interaction with others, how others treat others (and I guess, us, too) is how we identify and recognize what "morals" mean to us personally... Because humans are basically pattern recognition devices we are always searching for a "code", an overarching reason for our actions...  \n  \nBut you asked where do "morals" originate from, what the source is. I think you're getting closer in this post where you start to talk about human interaction and correlative behaviors in the context of morality... instead of assigning it to some distant untouchable god-source...\n
right... attack the source, don't examine the facts. 
The MaK kits are simple. The modern ones are made to be almost snap together kits if you want. It gets tricky when you want to start customizing them...  \n  \nHLJ is probably the best spot, as kat mentioned. Other retailers will have their own sales efforts online, like honemits or sometimes LoveLoveGarden from time to time. eBay tends to be really expensive, I'd stay away from there.  \n  \nIf you head over to the MaK Kreuger forum (http://maschinenkrueger.com/forum/) you can get a lot of info from some really helpful people and there's a ton of historical info.
First off, the question was "does anyone know how to find artist affordable housing?", not to offer a life critique on their career choice.  \n  \nSecond, art is a very valid career choice, simply everything around us has been touched by a trained artist at some point in its existence. This webpage and the fonts on the page were designed by an artist, as was the magazine you probably have on your desk, the photography in it, the chair you're sitting on, the monitor you're looking at, the building you're working in, the movie you're probably going to tonight...  all have been designed by artists trained at art schools. I could go on pretty much ad infinitum through every aspect of your life but I think I've made my point. Its a testament to how successful and ubiquitous that design and art have become in our lives that people like you can look around and say "I don't see the value of it". Kind of amazes me.  \n  \nAnd to the person asking the question: Is there a school counsellor you can go talk to? A person who can connect you with resources or offer advice on how to get in touch with housing resources?  \n  \nCan you go a woman's shelter?  \n  \n
Maybe we define miracles as a thing that happened but immediately reversed itself and left no detectable trace at all. Like the healing of amputees and the dead being returned to life.  \n  
I was arguing that it's not your right to judge homosexuality as "moral" or "immoral". Why do you think you have the right to do so?  \n  \nIt's not an attack to say that you haven't articulated the point you seem to want to be making. You just keep repeating the same things over and none of it are reasons, they're just stating your position...
What about the part where the 40 or 50 children were killed by a priest by calling on God to send a bear because the children mocked the priest? That kind of sanctions killing children for a pretty minor crime.  \n  \nhttps://bible.org/seriespage/4-elisha-and-two-bears-2-kings-223-25  \n  \nThis is my interpretation of course, but life doesn't seem all that sacred if the life of 42 kids can be taken - by being ripped apart by a bear - for simply making sport of a person.
I don't think thats a valid argument in this context. There is always choice. Many who've been drafted as soldiers have chosen to remain conscientious objectors.  \n  \nAnd what about the context of orders given that are illegal or immoral? The village massacres in Vietnam or the destruction Falujah for example? Would in your opinon any soldier simply 'following orders' absolve them of the moral obligation to not harm innocents?  \n  \nOr in the context of Christianity, or at least one version of them, you could maybe also argue that we have no choice because god has written our paths in the book of life or whatever and our futures are predetermined... And then I'd ask why would god have soldiers kill innocents if he knew it was against his rules?  \n  \nEDIT: Anyway, it seems the Pope has spoken: https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/01/09/pope-throws-gauntlet-religions-no-killing-gods-name/
It's not "lost", as in its not a thing I've misplaced and will stumble across one day again.  \n  \nI was not raised to be religious but the sense of the religion pervaded most of my life and culture and was a thing I just took unconsciously to be true, until I started to think about it. And I began to realize that very little of it made any real logical sense, and even less of it was related to the "morality" it claimed to be the authority and gatekeeper of. The more I learned about history the more it seemed like a cloak of sorts that just covered everything, and when I started reading Dawkins and hitchens it just faded away to dust.
You say that like its never happened with the republicans. 
Fuck. And the fuck fuck fucking fuckery fuck thing about it is that it means she's most definitely still wiggering her little fingers around in the DNC. The lessons people like her learn from failure, after so much success, is that they didn't do what they were doing well enough, that time.

> My point of this is that sometimes you are what you are because it is the only thing you know.\n\nI agree 100 percent!\n\nI guess the things we have to ask ourselves is something along the lines of "What is our core concerns?" I say "concerns" in particular because I don't want to say core "beliefs" - because its our concerns that define our political directions, and "beliefs" will come to fit whatever is expressed by the framework of the direction. And I don't want to tell anyone what their concerns should be, but I think when you consider what your personal concerns are, instead of trying to fit yourself into a "belief system" you can begin to more firmly realize your direction.  \n  \nMy personal concerns are for equality, fairness and from this I identify with many policies of the "left". Under no circumstance could I see myself shifting from this to supporting a conservative point of view because the current conservative policies simply do not support or address these concerns.  \n  \nThat this guy is able to do so shows me that his core concerns are not related to political ideology at all and so can be shifted and resourced easily. I dunno, maybe his real issues are with his parents and control, maybe thats why he can so easily and with so little provocation shift "camps". Or maybe the expression of his concerns were only a surface effort for political correctness's sake.  \n  \nI feel sad of course to loose someone to "the other camp" and hope he won't end up working against his old friends in some "conservative" capacity.
And that is not enough info to "prove" anything. See my original post above.
I don't know about you, but I just want to get along.
The election isn't over, it's only four years away!
Yeah, its not reborn if it continues to demonize Trump as the only issue to fight, and continues to keep faith with the current democratic party. Still, I hope for the best outcome, which to me is that people will begin to see the larger issues that need attacking such as corporations & their money in politics.
So you are not able to define what you consider as "harm" to a society, you only refer to "disruptive", which is at the very least nothing more than purely subjective.  \n  \nChildren playing in a corner can be considered "disruptive".  \n  \nI see no argument in your posts to support an absolute against homosexuality and I continue to not care one whit what my neighbors do in the privacy of thier homes.  \n  \nConsidering your lack of ability to articulate your concerns I encourage you consider again that you might do the same.
I've never seen a better example of online disassociation and disconnect in my whole life. And it makes me sad that some dick would give your douchey gag comment a gold.
Think on this too: how was his abuse allowed to continue for decades? What is broken in that system that a woman can be put into the hospital 4 times with clear signs of abuse and this not be looked into?
This breaks my heart in so many ways.
Did Scanlan ever find that figurine after the explosion? 
I mean, they rape animals, so...
Correlation is not causation...  Religion is one thing among many that influence many things in our world.   \n  \nIf you're asking if I/we think that religion has in the past influenced morality then well of course it has, but whats your real point? Many things from all aspects of our lives do, and I for one am glad that our culture seems to be generally moving away from pretending religion & the bible (in particular to our immediate culture) is still a relevant and defining factor of our moral codes.\n  \nAnd again I have to say, you need to first define what is the "morality" you're talking about? Is it the morality that demands I kill my neighbor with stones for swearing? That says I can own slaves? That says death is the punishment for working on Sundays? ...  
> Polls had Hillary ahead by 10-15% even a week before the vote.\n\nThey sure as hell did not.
In Canada the public healthcare movement began with one province, it wasn't a top down mandate. Thats how it'll happen in the US.
It's "how the market works" if you live in a bank or a holding company that's pretending to be a city. If you want to live in a functioning community the dynamics need to be a bit different.  \n  \nMy usual experience is that dividing line between who justifies the vancouver scenario and who decries it is who owns a property in van and who doesn't.
but her immediate financial needs can't be met by her long term goals. and her long term goals - art and design - are as valid as any other option. So dispense with judgement on the art effort and focus instead on helping her in the immediate.  \n  \nAnd I have to point out, as is I think reinforced by this post, that careers in art are chosen, followed, because of a love for it. Judge that as you may from whatever financial ideological perch you're sitting on, but to follow a love, especially into an art career, which is tough, is a lovely thing and should be respected, over a cynical choice to follow a practical path even though its not what you want... And the fact that if you're anyway half decent at art you can make a pretty good living at it is another issue altogether.   \n  \nJust because you don't understand or sympathize with the choice of an art based career is not a license to malign it.
> Idk if He actually did that or not.  \n  \nIts in the bible.  \n  \n> However, that's not the point of the story.  \n  \nThat you would even say "that's not the point of the story" of a story in which millions of people die you've completely lost the ability to gauge or recognize a real connection to actual humanity. I think the point of the story, from my point of view as it relates to christians, is  that some of them can feel and say things such as you've just written and not see the total inhumanity and simple evil of the thing. \n
no, she asked specific questions about her immediate situation.  \n  \nthat didn't and shouldn't empower anyone to pass judgement on her long term goals. her immediate financial needs can't be met by her long term goals. and her long term goals - art and design - are as valid as any other option. So dispense with judgement on the art effort and focus instead on helping her in the immediate.
Yes. Please be more current on your GroupThink terms please.
Bulldhit. It was a part of your argument, it's plain above. If not  Then why even raise in this thread? Anyway, you can respond to this part of my post:  \n  \n"We've already established (?) that the goal of gender unions is not necessarily purely for the purpose of procreation, because childless heterosexual couples are not attacked, so if the goal of homosexual unions is, as I imagine it is with almost all humans, to find love and peace and acceptance, then their unions are as valid as hetero unions. And so whats the real beef?"
The problem is religious people making claims about things in the world that can be easily debunked by applying a bit of logic and tools developed through scientific efforts. It's not that "science" is getting mixed up into territory claimed by "religion", it's that religion is stepping into areas that it shouldn't.  \n  \nPeople don't use science to debunk religion, they use scientific methods to examine claims made about the world by religious people.  \n  \nSo it's not that "science is the correct response to religion" it's that logical and critical thinking  is the correct response to provably false claims about the world and history. Other than that, keep your religion and have fun with it, but don't go complaining when claims like "the sun rotates around the world" or "the world is 6 thousand years old" is laughed out of classrooms.
That's a story, in a book. 
Simply pointing out that Israel is committing illegal acts and calling for a balanced look at the situation is now considered "bashing"...
A FIVE minute ad! What the flying hell youtube?  \n  \nI'd like to view the clip but will not sit through that ad to do it. Can you post a link to a place that does not insult us with that kind of ad bs?

Do you really think a benevolent god would resort to facile threats to enforce subservience? Is THAT the measure of there quality and requirements of your religion?  \n  \nBeyond that, what evidence for the existence of an afterlife do you offer?
Prove to me I was created for a purpose, please.
Awaiting your response.  \n  \nAlso, I'll point out that your don't have the right to "allow" homosexuality. It's your choice to publicly accept it or not, but don't ever presume you have the right to dictate to another person how they behave with consenting adults in private.
Isn't this what they call a strawman argument? 
No, there has to be more to it than that. There has to be a cultural acceptance of it that leads authorities to ignore obvious signs of abuse. And by "abuse" I mean BEATINGS.  \nA BRIEF look into it yields this:  \n"Domestic violence knows no boundaries and it affects women of all ages, colours, creeds and social backgrounds. Amnesty International has revealed that in France a women is killed by domestic violence at least every 4 days, and that 1 out of 10 women in France is a victim of domestic violence at some point in their lives. These figures are shocking and the French government has been urged to tackle the situation. Bear in mind that figures are based on statistics gathered from reported crime, which makes it all the more horrifying when you start to think how many of these crimes go unreported or worse still how many women are out there living in fear." From http://www.lost-in-france.com/living-in-france/life/190-domestic-violence\n  \n
How exactly has this "edge" manifested itself in practical terms? Can you give me any specific instances? I'm keen to hear. And can you pass me some tips on the lottery? You must have gotten your fair share at this point so it'll be cool to share.
 Think we've seen how that plays out.  \n  \nGet these assholes out.
:-)  \nI wish there was, but as far as I can see there just isn't.
Right. Good example.
Same place I suppose as the condemnation of the illegal settlement building over the past decades. Now that it's gotten so bad and brutal lately that some people are beginning to break the mold of silence and say things like "maybe we should start considering both sides of the issue" and actually noticing that the settlements are illegal instead of blind support, well suddenly it's "Israeli bashing".  \n  \nCalling this "lopsided"... Well, you've had the wind at your back for so long it seems like it's blowing against you when the wind has simply stoped blowing.
> It is what is good for the stability of the society in question.  \n  \nWhat harm can you point to in our society is caused by homosexuality?  \n  \nHow do you define "harm" on a societal level?\n
But "God's Word" is unchanging. Is the larger question then "why are people editing the bible to show the passages they like, and is this action a simple admission that the "Word of God" a complete fallacy?
Ive always thought the value of going to "better" colleges is the connections you make while studying, not the name of the institution on the final degree.
I guess the first thing I'd say is you are making an immediate assumption that morality is related to religion.  \n  \nBeyond this I for one will grant you nothing along the lines of anyone being "seeded" with a moral sense by any divine actor.  \n  \nAsk your friend to revise the discussion and both of you can examine if religion is actually related to morality, the way we understand it t today. I think you'll both be surprised at what you find when you begin to look into the kind of morality espoused in religion, especially the bible.  \n  \nMy personal feeling is that religion is secondarily an attempt to control people, I do admit that the first efforts of religion were toward understanding wonder, but I do think that morality has grown from empathy and sharing and that religion has co-opted that, not the other way around.
Well that's shitty of you to try to directly link a whole political movement to four sick individuals. Hey, what's your opinion on Dylan Roof? Pretty much discredits Christianity then I guess?
Without knowing the details of your situation I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the decision to close the plant would have been taken even without the strikes. At that point NAFTA had come into play and the plant was most likely moved to Mexico and would have been with or without strikes.  \n  \nSo I think saying "stuck one too many times" as if to indicate that all was perfectly well at the plant before them pesky unioners climbed too high is disingenuous.  \n  \nIts worth noting that since the 80s when the plants started moving away and unions have collapsed because of it the standard of living in the US and in particular the south has gone steadily down.
Sadly, no. The parties are merging and one is currently doing much better at PR. Neither of them give a shit about 'the common man' at this point. Though Trump is talking a good PR game, his choices for his cabinet show very very clearly that the republicans are not moving toward representing the little guy, and are in fact moving further  away from representing the concerns of the populace. The Republican Party in particular does not understand civics and has no respect at all for 'community organizing', instead imagining that running a public civic community like a private business will somehow add value to the experience, continuously forgetting the results of each new experiment such as Flint, Wisconsin, New Orleans...  No, the republicans are not coming round to representing the little guy. It'll take more than a series of election speeches to get me over to considering that point of view. All actions point to otherwise.
The editing was bad, the most jarring was the switching from cameras that appeared to be have different capture rates.

That's a really interesting take on it, thanks for your insight.

> It's all about restraining your desires. It is a test. Allowing homosexuality leads to many other moral absurdities where "love" is the leading reason, like pedophilia and bestiality.  \n  \nBut of course you do not want to restrict the right of heterosexual couples to meet and greet...  \n  \nWe've already established (?) that the goal of gender unions is not necessarily purely for the purpose of procreation, because childless heterosexual couples are not attacked, so if the goal of homosexual unions is, as I imagine it is with almost all humans, to find love and peace and acceptance, then their unions are as valid as hetero unions. And so whats the real beef?  \n  \nAlso, personally I do not accept that there is a valid place in this discussion - in fact I think its offensive - that you have branched immediately from homosexuality into pedophilia, as if they are intrinsically connected. They are not. You mention statistics, and so be aware that no studies show that homosexuals are more likely to engage in pedophelia that heterosexuals. Within some areas this may be linkable, but its been shown that this is more connected to the types of people who are drawn to these circles, such as, for example, the priesthood. Along these lines I take it you do not favor restricting the access of priests to children, even though the prevalence of pedohelia in the priesthood is shown to be multiple times greater than among the general populace?\n
i'll need some references to specific incidents on that statement please.
Don't feed the troll.
And Netanyahu decried the obvious anti-semetism of the investigation and declared that any vote for an investigation of him would be considered an act of war by obvious racists...
No.
If you don't think the Christian god as its represented in the bible is deplorable then you're not paying attention.
By this justification anyone can say anything they want and we have to accept it because "maybe they could". If there's a murder trial then the justification for convicting and condemning them would be "well maybe they could have done it, or maybe the judge has more info than they're showing, and they might have...".  \n  \nI don't know about you, but my standards for evidence and fact and are bit higher than something is because it might be, especially when it comes to government decisions that affect deeply al of our lives.  \n  \n
"What Do We Want"?  \n"Evidence Based Science!"  \n"When Do We Want It?"  \n"After Peer Review!"

You can't blame them for what they think, but you can ask them to respect what you do.  \n  \nUnfortunately I think you will have to decide right up front - what's the end game of this battle? How hard are you willing to go with your relatives? Are you willing to cut them off over this?  \n  \nAnother poster recommended education in various other religions, but this then requires  that you make your relatives into some kind of "example" for only one of the religions, which in the long term is  going to damage thier relationship with your kids.  \n  \nSo I say again, you will have to decide right up front - what's the end game of this battle? I think you need to ask your relatives  to respect your beliefs and to keep theirs  to themselves. Period. Because  that seems to be the course of action that observes the most general respect for all, all around. But of course that probably won't end well. Good luck.
Well then I suppose they shouldn't have spent the past 80 years smashing the shit out of their countries, so the oil companies could benefit. If they hadn't done that they could have continued to enjoy holidays in the "Paris of the Middle East" and other once pleasant places not smashed into absolute shit holes.
Ah, they're working with "alternative facts" too I See. Amazing.
Sure, but my point is that his "conservatism" is as shallow as his "liberalism" and I expect it will disappear to another more convenient or shiny camp as soon as things go off.  \n  \nPersonally I don't think its possible to "switch" from progressive to conservative...
Thats sort of like saying "guns don't kill people, people kill people." Which is true but as Eddie Izzard says "I kinda think the guns helped."  \n  \nReligion is not encouraging our better tendencies in this context, its part of the problem thats keeping our society from advancing. The better we are able to root it out of playing an active part in our lives the more we will be able to advance, scientifically and socially.  \n  \nAnd anyway, even when you consider the modern world, much of our modern morality does not come from our religious past. The more we can move past owning slaves, condoning genocide, stoning adulterers, killing heretics, burning witches the better and better we can be.
Give us the fact then, please.

Shame on this kid, and shame on the retailer for not IDing a kid when he buys anything for that much money with a credit card.  \n\nAt least this can all get ironed out since most places will accept returns without a receipt if you're using a credit card.
I like the idea, but logistically maintaining two lists would quickly become a nightmare.\n\nHe would be better off listing using the following columns; Full Name, Location of Birth, Occupation, Judgement.\n\nThis would solve for issues on space since he's no longer maintaining two seperate tables.  Although to have honest, depending on how many people he meets, without some type of index... he's going to have a hard time maintaining the list.\n\nUnless, he were open to cross referencing the data in the table.  If he were to provide the record number of that person's judgement to said person, then he would be able to easily determine if he had met that individual before.\n\nSo, for example, let's say his very first meeting is with Robert the Scribner of Podunkburg and he determines Robert is nice, the record would read as follows in the book: Robert, Podunkburg, Scribner, Nice.  Then your character would make note of the page number, and line number, in this example it would be "001-01".\n\nHe would then brand this unique identifier to Robert, somewhere where your character could easily recognize it as his unique ID (perhaps the back of the hand, or perhaps on the forehead.)  Then, after fifteen years, your Cleric returns and stumbles across person 001-01, and finds that "Robert" is now naughty, he can update his journal with the proper data.\n\nWhat do you think?

The EPA doesn't recognize tests done by private citizens.  Apparently, when the officials tested, they only tested cold water sink taps, not hot water taps from the bath or from the water heater directly.
Those are some pretty neat earmuffs.
I'll be honest, I figured it wasn't real because it just seemed too unbelievable.  Of course, in hindsight, it obvious that this took place afterwards -- but at the time of the initial watching I didn't understand a lot about this video.

Maybe "Locate Object" doesn't exist as a spell in the Mercerverse. 
Yeah, but that's too too bad.  When Sanders first announced there was no doubt that he would loose.  It wasn't until his message started getting heard that people realized he wasn't a lunatic.  I'll forgive John Stewart dismissal at the beginning, but once his rallies start doubling and tripping Clinton's turnout... well then it's harder to forgive/overlook.
... so, has /r/SAVEBRENDAN become a joke?\n\nI haven't seen a ton of his films, but I mean there are at least a half-dozen movies he's been in that are much better than this kids movie.\n\nWhat about, School Ties, the Mummy, Gods and Monsters, Bedazzled, or even Airheads?\n\n(Edit: Spelling mistakes were made.)

Thank you for this.  [Per ADA rules set in 2010](http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#c5), a stencil on the ground is not an indication of a handicap parking space.  There **must** be a sign placed in clear sight of the space (either by being posted to the facade of the building) or on a post driven into the ground.\n\nDoes anyone know if Massachusetts or Hyannis has passed additional laws to make a stencil on the ground enough to designate a handicap parking space?\n\nOtherwise as much as people dislike this, the trooper didn't do anything wrong.

Otherwise, whats the point of the signature line on the back?\n\nNow... if this kid was using it as a debit card, then it's totally on the mother for giving him the PIN.\n\nEither way, this kid is a piece a crap for stealing from his mother, and for speaking with her like the way he did.
Startup has been in sort of an odd place lately.  The first two seasons were really interesting... but the most recent season wasn't really so much about the details of starting a business, but rather sort of a biopic of Dov whats-his-name.\n\nYou can check out /r/gimlet for more on the StartUp debate.
No, I totally agree with you.  As much as I want to be a cheerleader for the MBTA, I cannot ignore a lot of the systemic issues it faces.\n\nThe T has been the victim of some awful deals, but they've also made a lot of their own mistakes.\n\nThere isn't a simple fix, and there isn't a single person or even entity to blame for what they've become.
As Nikolai meets and judges more and more individuals, his list would become simply impossible to maintain were it two separate tables with simply the person's name.\n\nIt's not that it wouldn't be easy, there simply would be no way to determine, in any reasonable manner, if he had already judged them and if so which list to check.  Even allowing for Nikolai to check his list twice still would only increase the chance of error.\n\nA standard indicator; be it ink, hot iron branding, or some type of magic (as some have suggested) would allow him to painstakingly check his list (even twice) and make sure he judges accurately.

Alternative theory:  Juno is drinking Sunny D because she's still a kid in a lot of ways.  (I don't think any adult looks at Sunny D and honestly considers it orange juice, it's more like an orange drink.)\n\nI believe it was more of a nod to her vanishing childhood, and less of an abortion method.

Who did "Heliophysics" and "Solar System Exploration" used to be?
There's probably a lot going on behind the scenes.  I would tend to agree that it's surprising that these can't be posted on their schedule -- but maybe we don't know what they're dealing with.\n\nIt could be a staffing issue, it could be a workflow issue... we'll probably never know the real reason we see delays.  It's sort of like homeland security, we never learn about the successes -- we only see the failures.
For what it's worth, if you want to see his real acting chops -- check out "School Ties."  That movie is incredible!
What movie was the end scene from?  With the weird smoke?
Ahh... okay, so when Rufus brings Jim Martin to the future at the very beginning of the movie -- this is a post battle of the bands Jim Martin where Station is introduced to the world and joins Wild Stallions?\n\nThat makes a lot of sense, and also surprises me with the foreshadowing the writers included in the movie -- because let's be honest -- it's not the best written movie in the world.
Why in the world would the killer bring his ID with him?

Ah-ha, little Bobby Tables, we meet again.
My wife and I were able to celebrate the birth of our third child in June of last year.  My wife, unfortunately, has been struggling with (and receiving treatment for) Post Partum Depression since.\n\nMy prior employer was mostly understanding of this, and at first was very accommodating -- however, as my wife continued to receive treatment -- they began nitpicking my tardiness (even though I would make the time up.)\n\nI was unceremonously terminated on Monday, and have discussed my options with a lawyer.  However, in the meantime -- I want to make sure I don't undermine my potential future employment.\n\nHow do I address my parting with my previous employer, with potential new employers?  And, how can I speak to them of my wife's ongoing medical treatments so that it doesn't outright disqualify me from future rounds of interviews?\n\nI'm happy to elaborate as much as I can legally.  Thank you in advance.

There are some who believe that during the Internet outage, the embassy where Assange has resided, was raided and that he was captured or killed.\n\nThese individuals point to evidence like Wikileaks' twitter account changing its "voice" as an example that it is now being controlled by the CIA or NSA.\n\nThere are some who believe this so much that they point to modern technologies that would allow another person to pass themselves off as Assange (at least digitally) by auto tuning their voices to sound like his, and having software mask their appearances for video feeds.

You didn't see past reports. There's a history here. Like I said, the sub operates on a tag system. When enough tags come in, they go to review, and someone bans them. The deleted comments did include equating Muslims/migrants to rapists.
The trigger is absolutely amazing. The perfect amount of pressure for both your first shot and subsequent shots.

What you said is funny because most criminal offenses (at least in America) require some sort of "mens rea," otherwise known as a state of mind. You can get away with a lot of crimes if you don't fall into the correct state of mind category. They're purpose, knowing, recklessness, and negligence. Crimes without a mens rea are categorized as "strict liability."\n\nThis is all in the context of the American legal system. I've got no idea how they do it over there. \n\nEdit: should also mention there are defense known as mistake of fact and mistake of law which could be relevant here (again, in America). It's a lot to explain, and it's been a while since I took criminal law, so I'll leave it at that. \n\nAlso, IANAL. Just a law student. Lawyers should feel free to correct me. 
I have a serious question. How does something come into common use later when you're restricting its use?

I did this. I ended up getting lucky and renting to my sister. Before that happened I was looking into a rental agency. My advice: do whatever works for you.
Your edit is correct. It's an SR22. You can snag one brand new for around $300 so it's not too expensive if you're in the market for a new toy.

Very few people here are probably psychologists/psychiatrists, so I'll try to help you with my own personal example. \n\nI've had some mental health problems in the past. I went to a psychologist and a psychiatrist for about two years. It was the only thing that worked for me. Nothing else I tried (exercise, eating right, mindfulness) worked. You really need to work on it with someone else if you want to get better. When you share your thoughts with another person who cares about you, a huge weight lifts off of your shoulders. Trust me on that.   \n\nAnd I'd think you don't need to disclose that to C&F. It's personal health information.

They've been deleted. Just look. You kept saying things about how we supposedly removed X and Y. You admitted you're wrong *right there.* I showed you the proof.

I am, however, unsure of who banned you.  \n\nEdit: looked through his comment history. He is a repeated rule offender. He was banned based on our system tagging him. \n\nEdit2: he admits to copy-pasting a comment deleted by a moderator [here.](http://i.imgur.com/6neSjJw.jpg) This is why he was banned.

Don't mind the troll. His post history is full of him talking about shooting minorities. He should be banned, but I guess the mods didn't notice.
Are you really upset that I legally and responsibly own a gun? It took me 2 years to get through the NY regulations to get this. I was vetted like crazy and had a court date over it.
I have only one handgun because I'm a beginner. It's a little pea shooter -- an SR22. Pretty easy to learn on.
Have fun! Looks like you're making a great quality build. If I were you, I'd focus on either strength or dex alone on my first playthrough. In subsequent NG cycles you should level the other one. The soft cap for STR and DEX is 40-45. I always stop at 40 and work on the next one.

If you really want, I can take screenshots of all of your removed comments over the last few days. You got tagged by our system for repeated rule offenses. That particular comment was deleted because it was posted 3 other times today. Someone reported it, we removed it, it resulted in a tag. You had accrued enough tags to earn a ban. A mod reviewed it and approved it. That's how the ban system works.

Google Lizzie Borden.
Quelaags furysword is actually pretty great. It got me through my first or second playthrough way back when.
You're exactly right. I think she needed a mens rea of purpose or knowing, but she was just negligent or reckless. Can't be sure which mens rea she actually had if the case is never tried, though. It was just their guess as to whether she would be convicted.
So it's kind of a "we can't do this because of X" versus "I don't want to do this shit anymore because of X?"
I'd see them there again.
He's spamming a bunch of garbage on alts about his ban from /r/worldnews where we mod. He was banned for bigotry and won't let it go that we're "censoring" him.

>Have any of you attended any of the local private schools yourself? Which school  (if you don't mind saying)?\n\nYep, I went to McQuaid (class of 2010 -- if anyone sees this, say hello!)\n\n> What grade level(s)?\n\nGrades 7-12\n\n>Did you like it?  \n\nI absolutely loved it. Would do it again if I could go back in time.\n\n> When you were in private school, were you happy to be in private instead of public school? \n\nYeah. There's a lot of school pride. You know you've got a leg up over all of the other students for jobs, college, etc.\n\n>How do you feel about it now? \n\nI plan to send my kids there when they're going into 6th grade.\n\n>Would you have preferred to attend a different school (private or public, and which one)?\n\nNo\n\n> In your opinion, what were the advantages and disadvantages of being in the private school you attended compared to being in public school or a different private school?\n\nThe only disadvantage was the lack of girls. That could be viewed as a positive depending on who you ask, though. Advantage was getting to wear a suit every day and also the superior education\n\n> Do you think your life now would be any different if you hadn't been in that private school? \n\nProbably wouldn't have gone to the college I went to if I didn't attend private school. That would entirely change what I'm up to right now.\n\n> If you had your own kids, would you send them to the school you attended or a different school/district?  \n\nI'd send them to McQuaid. I don't think I'd be in law school if not for the lessons I learned there. When I finish school and have kids, I'll definitely send them there. My father attended, which is why I went there in the first place. My grandpa went to Aquinas. Private school is a family tradition.

I remember this coming up in law school, and the gist of his tax issue was basically a series of tax shelters he was using became invalid due to a change in the tax code. He couldn't get the assets liquid and moved into other shelters for whatever reason and he got slammed. This wasn't a case where he was misreporting or anything like that. I should note, the super rich avoid this problem by employing full-time tax lobbyists, who do nothing but ensure there are protections for their assets in the tax code.  Literally 95% of the top 1% pay zero taxes.  None.  Give that some thought next time someone says lets raise taxes on the rich. We don't need to raise them, we need to take away their exemptions so they pay their fair share.
No its not. Conspiracy theories concerning the Rothschild family date back to the 18th century, and the family's wealth was largely responsible for the anti-semitic belief that "Jews control the world's money supply."

Then you're a dumb fuck.  Much like the Fortune 50,, the richest individuals also avoid tax burdens you stupid ignorant fuck.  You think that little revel of Trumps not paying taxes is unusual? Because the super wealthy generally are not paid a salary, they do things like trust freezing, converting common stock into preferred stock (so common stock is converted preferred that is held by a trust and then the not taxable capital gains can allow you liquidity from the interest), they invest in specialized instruments that in turn get reconverted into new specialized instruments upon maturity, they get paid out (since its a global economy) in countries like Monaco where they can avoid taxes or in countries with very low taxes and can reimport that cash through a variety of financial mechanism, shell companies set u for the sole purpose of pooling for accrued income and other gains --this also allows for absorbing losses that you then can match again income in your US accounts erasing your tax burden (these are particular points where a lobbyist helps as its tricky to pull these off), equity swaps, you can also use one personal shell corporation you control to stock swap out another one you control and ping pong the money back and forth avoiding capitol gains, or  (another Trump technique) you can incorporate your personal brand to channel wages through a nominal corp --pay yourself interest free and claim pretty much everything you do and buy as an expense legally.

American here who just moved back from Poland after a couple of years There.  First off, Poland's current government is Trump before Trump.  Secondly, Poland may seem like its become a Western European country-- its not. Its just not there yet. If this doesn't make you think twice, its relatively easy to find work in Poland as an American.  The people are great (extra nice to people of Polish decent that are Americans). Health care is very good and amazingly cheap even as an immigrant on a private insurance plan. University is also very very very inexpensive if you are so inclined.  If you are in Krakow, Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw, and Lodz, you can get away wth not speaking Polish for the most part (good luck at a butcher or dealing with a plumber) --elsewhere, not so much.  Many US companies have Polish operations (GE, Google, Uber, etc etc). If you are younger, the tech start-up scene is great in Poland and they always can use Americans for marketing, sales, writing, and customer service. Good luck.

I am sorry to hear of your friends father's condition.  I lost my wife to GBM and have worked with several companies developing treatments.  There are a number of drugs specifically targeted to address the swelling (avastin for instance ).  Some of these are roids targeted for cancer.  More often than not there will be a lot of weight gain rapidly \n. Some things to look at include Novacure and a ketogenic diet.  Both of those have shown the ability to extend lifespans for this disease. Unfortunately extend generally means 3-4 months.  There are a very limited number of exceptions but literally this is about the worst cancer in the world to get. You might look to see if he is eligible for the Trial at UCLA that Dr. Clousey is leading.  The general concept is to give the brain another disease and let the immune response from the body kill the cancer while it's at it. There is another at Duke that got a lot of press and shows some promise but to be honest the real numbers on effectiveness are no where as good as Duke pretends.  Also know. When you do certain kinds of treatment it fucks up your chances to get into certain trials.  Good luck. My best advice beyond treatment is to do everything you can to make him happy and let him experience anything cool he ever dreamed of. And make sure your friend and his love ones have everything they need.  Even if they say they are managing fine. Help. Car rides. Groceries. Meals. House cleaning. All of these little things add up.  Try and get a team of friends to undertake these tasks for the family.

The Rams trade for the Titians first overall pick (select Jared Goff )--Tennessee got the Rams' first-round pick, which was No. 15 overall, plus two second-round picks (43 and 45 overall) and a third-round pick (76), plus a 2017 first and third. The Titans are sending a 2016 fourth and sixth-round pick back to the Rams.  A few years earlier, the RG3 trade (again the Rams) Redskins received a 2012 first-rounder (No. 2: QB Robert Griffin III) \nRams received: 2012 first-rounder (No. 6: Traded to Cowboys), 2012 second-round selection (No. 39: CB Janoris Jenkins), 2013 first-rounder (No. 22: Traded to Falcons), 2014 first-rounder (No. 2: OT Greg Robinson) \n\nThrough additional draft trades of those picks, the Rams also acquired LB Alec Ogletree, DT Michael Brockers, WR Stedman Bailey, RB Zac Stacy, RB Isaiah Pead and OG Rokevious Watkins. Ogletree, Brockers and Jenkins are all starters on the Rams' defense. Robinson is the team's starting left tackle, and Bailey is a regular contributor in the passing and return games.   \n\nSo I'd ask, along with the Bradford example, how is Jimmy G not going to net at least a 1st and a 4th in this insane QB market?

You can expand the strokes (Object---> Path--> Outline Stroke) and use the outlined strokes to knock out the shapes behind them, including the part of the heads that the outlined stroke overlaps. You can use the shape builder tool to do this. The default setting of the Shape Builder tool is to combine shapes. Hold option and you'll see the minus sign indicating subtract. There's a faster way but these explanations take too long, especially because I don't know how to type.

It looks cool and you've obviously spent a lot of time on this, however, this is more of an illustration than a logo. You need to reduce the complexity.

Agreed. I haven't played since Bad Company 2. It's seems like a totally new game that I've never played. I'm enjoying it so much more with each new thing I learn. Spotting is something I didn't know about.

Be sure to get a rotary cutter with you get the cutting mat. 
Only one tiny problem I have is with the dude's left hand. There's a sliver of blue that showing that could be removed by making his arm a little bigger. But shit, this thing is 99.99% perfect and beautiful. 
Try adding more contrast to make it more visually interesting. Consider making the top part of the sky gradient a very dark almost black purple/blue. \n\nThe pickle is my favorite part, however, the clouds are really throwing off the whole composition for me. Maybe if they were simpler shapes and pushed back into the background more they wouldn't be a distracting. If you did explore that you'd also have to rethink the moon. \n\nI guess you should ask yourself what the focal point of this piece is. 
I think the problem is you're trying to use two different styles. The hair is realistic and the rest is very stylized. Keep working on a stylized version of the hair.
There are a few ways to do this. The method I'm about to describe is what I would to to just achieve what you are asking. If you were drawing the entire shirt and jacket I would give you different advice.\n\nSelect the left and right paths, copy (command+c) both paths, don't paste them yet. Select all (command+a) of the paths and lock them (command+2). Paste the paths that you copied in front (command+f). Now is a good time to change the stroke color so you can see what you're doing in the next step. Use the direct selection tool to select the points that make up the left and right collars and hit delete. Now you should have the left and right side. You can use the pen tool to close this shape but I would join them using command+j. I can't see the bottom of your art so I don't know if you would have to use command+j once or twice. If it's open on both the top and bottom you will need to join it twice. Or use the pen tool to close the shape.
He needs to walk back their shitty logo.
That's how I do it. Background image on a master page goes on the bottom layer. I'm kind of crazy so I usually name this layer "background". Everything else goes on layers above it. 
Whatever, he nailed it.
Shape builder tool. 
I like these so much. The style is like deconstructed playing cards. Great work. 
Before it gets too warm you should consider drinking a glass of hot potato flakes. Shitty food pro tip: Use chicken broth instead of water.
Why do hot sauce labels *and* names get shittier with increased Scoville scores? 
This right here is almost perfect. I just can't tell if the skeleton is kissing a man or a woman. Maybe some flowing hair would make me realize that this is a woman receiving the kiss of death. Great composition and color. 
Dad seems jelly.
The colors are great. 
The reflected light really make this piece exceptional. Really nice work. 
Next stop prison?
The underline is the only thing that bugs me. I see that it lines up with the U and R but the gap between the line and the P is too large. It creates negative tension. 
Tortilla chip crumbs with habanero sauce?
I don't always fuck up titles but when I do it goes to the front page. 
[This shittier?](http://i.imgur.com/KDbUyiL.jpg)
Looks like a restart might help this. I've had something similar happen, I think it's a bug. 
Not sure how you could do that and keep the composition.  But... that's your job. Post any updates. 
It doesn't look bad, it just doesn't match. Come one, man. You can do it!
Don't throw away the packaging until you're done cooking. You're going to need the instructions.
The top clouds mainly. They were so distracting that I didn't notice you had the same cloud shapes in the bottom too. \n\nIf the chard is your focal point try to make sure it's the brightest thing in your composition. The bright orange moon is also competing. Try some atmospheric perspective. Things in the foreground could be lighter and as things move father away they could get darker. Just a thought. Also, if the shard is the focal point try the cool little airplane closer to it. Maybe going the other direction to it. Things like that tend to lead the eye. 
It could be super tight if the hair broke out of the coffin frame. 
Select the bulb and flame, hold option while using Shape Builder.

Maybe looks like lips kissing. She's so fit and the rest of her spacesuit fits like a glove, I don't see a reason why it needs to be baggy there. Also looks like you spent more time on the body and have neglected the helmet a bit. A shadow on that would not be out of place. Sorry, I realize you didn't ask for input I just can't help myself.

> You don't get to complicate the ballot to get a vote you want\n\nneither do you. How does mentioning that it's the current system make it simpler? It doesn't, and only helps the people who don't want it to change by appealing to nostalgia.\n\n> If people want a system with less hassle, is that not a valid argument?\n\nYou misunderstand me. I didn't mean the system is less hassle, I mean changing systems, and in that case, it is a (weak) valid argument.\n\n> Arguing treating all systems equally for the sake of equality is a weak argument.\n\nWhen you want to change it, why would you try to influence voters by favoring one ?\n\n> The onus is on the proponents of change to explain why the change is necessary.\n\nYes, but it's not the job of the government to complicate the process by making the ballots be anything more than the list of systems.\n\nIn the case of Quebec, the question had to be "legalproof" because the government of Canada rarely acts of good faith concerning Quebec, thus the question was crafted by lawyers and comprehension plummeted as a result.
> Who would you praise more? A man who climbed a mountain with only his strength or a man who drove up the mountain? \n\nThere already is a difference there. If the goal is to reliably get to the top of the mountain, someone who chooses to climb it the hard way is an idiot. The end result of building a PC is that a PC is built. It doesn't matter how many instruction manuals you followed. PCPartPicker makes it easy to see if a graphics card is too long, and that somehow diminishes the effort of physically building it? I'm guessing you think Youtube is cheating too?\n\nNow, if you personally think that 12 year olds shouldn't post their builds, downvote and move on. Saying that "they didn't really build it" is not constructive or helpful in any way, except making you feel better about being jealous of the resources that kid has.
they should get the exact same say as everyone else in the party.

 j'ai juste de la misère à comprendre l'absence totale d'empathie et d'ouverture d'esprit à chaque fois que je vais sur TD. En général y'a toujours des gens avec 2-3 upvotes pour rappeler à l'ordre, mais les 2 permières pages de comments c'est des memes, des 'libcucks BTFO' et des conspirations du niveau de pizzagate. Je dis pas que tout le monde est pareil, mais le echo chamber encourage une pensée très divisive sur TD plus qu'ailleurs vu que les mods ont adopté une politique anti-le reste de reddit, et que les mods font leur possible pour envoyer chier les admins sans se faire bannir.
> Voter ID laws is not the same thing as minority voter suppression.\n\nIt is if voter ID is hard to get for no particular reason, except of course racism.\n\n> And having a first past the post system does not make elections any less democratic.\n\nMaybe it doesn't make them un-democratic, but it definitely makes them less democratic. 
i can't dispute that there are elements of the seperatist movement  that are racist, but why are you generalizing that all of us demonize everything different?
not describing myself, describing what i've heard others say, but on call is often used to block hours for which you have to be available, and some just just ban you from having any other job outright. \n\nAlso using vacation days for registering to vote / get appropriate ID is fucking stupid. In Quebec they implemented it so you can bring shit like utilities bills and city services cards, or even have someone take a pledge that you are who you say you are to prove your identity, thus eliminating the need for a vacation day, and even then, you get a mandatory 4 hours off of work to go vote. 
C'est difficile de justifier de parler un bon français quand ce "bon français" inclut des mots comme gazouillis, clavardage, et toutes les autres traductions forcées, inutiles et inefficaces. Je crois que si on, en tant que société, acceptait que ces mots sont contraires à l'évolution de la langue et/ou des noms propres qu'on essaie de *retrofit* au français sans autre raison que "ça sonne français", et qu'on mettait plus l'accent sur des mots réellement français et les structures de phrase,  on  ralentirait de beaucoup l' "assimillation" du français au québec. Si on essaie de séparer les deux langues sous vide, c'est comme la prohibition, on perd le contrôle de la qualité lorsque les échanges inévitables se font.

My galaxy tab s is a great example of why the android tablet market failed, it went from useable to unreliable garbage just in time for the warranty to run out, just like the nexus 7 2012 I owned before. Unlike phones however, tablets don't get changed as often and noticing the flaws becomes more probable over time. Installing AOSP nougat didn't help, wifi keeps dropping randomly and even only using youtube and sync for reddit, i get performance issues. The charging port is also trash, but that's more a fault of micro-usb getting worn out easily. Honestly apple's tablet ecosystem is just so much better, once I have the money I will buy an iPad.

> Would a player who only speak English be considered a problem too?\n\nOf course not. It never is, in any context. I don't like getting political in this sub, but official institutional bilinguism's only purpose is making sure francos understand english well enough to receive orders. Québec tried to counteract this, and it's seen as racist. This might be changing on a community by community basis in Ontario, Manitoba and NB but everywhere else I see, speaking an official language is not good enough, because it's not the right one.

Some guy uploaded a video of him driving without a seatbelt in quebec a few years back and got a ticket for it even if the police didn't see it happen. However, recently speed camera tickets are being overturned due to the wording of the law requiring the officier is the one who can "notice" (constater)  the crime being committed, so it's unclear.
yeah they fall in the category that you need 2 pieces of proof, one with your name and address + one with a picture and your name.

to me its only big flaw is that you max out everything inside of 2 hours, 1 hour depending on the amount of events. To have talked to many people who played both cities:skylines and simcity 2013, simcity 2013 often wins that comparison for enjoyment, graphics and learning curve.\n\n

I've been saying this since last year, offence and speed is what has kept Tampa in it, and it as made up for lackluster defense. I have seen plenty of games from 2014 to 2016 where Tampa is losing by multiple goals going in the third and then catches up because of speed in the last 10 minutes. That speed and coordination hasn't been there recently.\n\nBoth goalies letting in goals in the first few shots could be a symptom of Tampa having the only goalie tandem in the league which that happens to regularly, or maybe, just maybe, Tampa has no defensive depth and once that first shift is over the opposition pounces?\n\n
Pour le travail.

Saying FPTP is the current system without explaining how it works is every bit as disingenuous as you claim not mentioning it is the current system is. It's like having the options be\n\n* [ ] FPTP ( splits the vote by forcing strategic voting ) \n* [ ] MMP / STV / RCV\n\nIt's equally stating facts, but it's lying by omission. Some, even most people will go into the voting booth only remembering the last ads that each campaign put out. Seeing "current system" will just mean people will vote for it because "it's less hassle", without necessarily knowing the rest of the arguments. There should ba a pro/con list approved by each campaign on the ballot.\n\n

J'ai même pas un problème avec le concept, mais ce qui m'agace est que la librairie prétend parler pour plusieurs minorités en disant que tous ces mouvements sont "liés aux féminisme" \n\n>Dans les féminismes, il y a beaucoup de débats, de discussions, de théories et de réflexions qui dépassent strictement l’association de féminisme et femme, mentionne Stéphanie Dufresne. Les collections antiracistes ou sur le capacitisme qu’on veut développer, ça a du sens pour nous d’avoir cela dans une librairie féministe. On y voit un lien avec la littérature sur les féminismes.\n\nScuse mais non. De un, combiner des mouvements ensemble mène à rien (voir occupy) . De deux, c'est implicite qu'elles croient que pour être un vrai antiraciste, il faut être 100% féministe, et vice-versa, et ça décourage ceux qui ne veuleent pas utiliser une étiquette ou l'autre.

Pour l'avoir vécu, les manuels (comme les profs varient je peux pas généraliser pour eux, mais y doit pas avoir 20 manuels d'ECR, et logiquement les manuels sont plus soumis aux critères du ministère) forcent vraiment les idées que\n\n1. l'appartenance à une religion (peu importe laquelle) détermine la moralité  ( il y a une section dédiée aux athées, mais en général c'est du même niveau que l'ordre du temple solaire et traité avec le même respect )\n\n2. Tous les êtres humains sont bons  et si quelqu'un fait quelque chose de mal c'est pas de sa faute. (Sauf ceux qui utilisent des bouteilles d'eau et/ou critiquent la religion, eux autres c'est des démons)\n\nAussi, chaque fois qu'il avait un "débat éthique" dans le manuel, c'était évident que les auteurs voulaient faire ressortir un vainqueur évident, toujours celui de la "bonne morale populaire". Avoir des opinions,  c'est fortement découragé.

i guess i saw the second part as being sarcastic
I'm really trying to reassure myself that we're only 4 points out of a playoff spot, nothing is lost yet. But there's no way we're making any sort of comeback this year if they keep playing like this. A few weeks ago I blamed the defense for this shit, but goaltending has also been awful, and nothing on the offence is connecting. I didn't get to watch the whole game, but the little I saw seems to be representative according to these comments. You see the individual player's efforts too, but it never goes anywhere. Drouin getting the puck around everyone, great moves, passes in front of the net - no one there, gets cleared. Shot from the blue line, no one's there for the rebound. Power play , shot, rebound, defenseman clears it - no one at the blue line, goes to Bishop. This is shit I expect from my local college team, not the NHL.

Déjà, avec le titre clickbait, ça augurait mal, mais en plus l'article est un concentré de rectitude politique, au sens où elle choisit ses mots pour ne pas paraîte mal. D'abord y'a le classique les *séparatisss* qu'on voit souvent, mais il est encore plus condescendant que d'habitude et il affirme la supériorité intellectuelle de l'auteure! Et si on analysait une phrase :\n\n>  The wisdom of separatists was not in the instinct to leave; it was in defining exactly which values mattered to them, and using those values as a template after the referendum to find a way to belong inside Quebec, and also inside Canada—for now, at least.\n\nAssez innocent à première vue. Par contre, on voit d'abord qu'elle considère l'indépendance comme une menace et les sépératistes d'un point de vue colonisateur (y sont accidentellement corrects, mais faut pas leur laisser une chance de s'exprimer, sinon y risque de pas avoir mon opinion!). Elle réduit le désir d'autodétermination à un instinct, quelque chose d'animal, d'inhumain, et de même, généralise des millions de québecois à de pauvres inférieurs.\n\n> If certain politicians have their way, someday my friends’ children may also find themselves voting in a shattering separatist referendum.\n\nParce qu'élire un démagogue anti-science corrompu pour faire chier l'establishement aura les mêmes conséquences qu'une nation qui après avoir élu un parti gauchiste, décide de s'autodéterminer.\n\nY'a évidement l'équivalent de *chu pas raciste, j'ai un ami noir*\n\n> They’ve married and befriended French Canadians.\n\nEn somme, ce que je pense de cet article est qu'au moins les commentaires du gazette et les pages facebook qui appluadissent Richard Henry Bain ont le mérite d'être intègre.

Pretty sure you can't own any assault rifle made/registered after 1986, and those prices have gone way up due to that.

great moves, brian. keep it up. proud of you

problem is the center is no longer the center, it's firmly in the right because the tea party has normalized right-wing extremism. "ceding an inch to the center" will only result in the right taking a yard, because they will never compromise. it's portrayed as weakness by the right wing media when it happens, and common sense when it doesn't.  \n\nMoving to the left is not only a social thing, Bernie's trade policy was what made him popular in the midwest. Trade isn't exactly easily defined on a gradient, but I would say that it was to the left in terms of the motives. I can't speak for the results, I'm not an expert.

Problem with that point of view is it'll lead to less and less french in Canada until it's eventually removed as an official language. You're right though, there is no point to anglos learning french, because the official bilinguism policy was not designed for that, and for most places outside quebec that spoke french, they had converted / been killed already by the time it was at its strongest in the 80s.

C'est juste que quand tu rencontres en proportion égale (même si c'est pas représentatif de la réalité) des gens qui croient que les femmes doivent être égales et  des gens qui croient que les hommes c'est tous des nazis, et que ces deux groupes utilisent la même étiquette, y'en a qui dévloppent la réaction de ne pas aimer ceux qui portent l'étiquette. \n\nJe me considère féministe maintenant mais avant c'était différent, j'étais autant pour l'égalité homme-femme mais la minorité de féministes qui veulent brimer la liberté d'expression et promouvoir la "vengeance" (voir la violence physique et psychologique) envers les hommes, tout en brandissant le *manspreading* et tous ces autres non-problèmes m'ont fait fuir l'étiquette pendant quelques années.

It's fair to analyse them for what they are, alt-right propaganda about how the blacks are killing the whites, and that black people protesting police brutality are wrong .\n\n> and from there come up to the conclusion that he will somehow deport or exterminate the blacks?\n\nWhere have I claimed that?  The conclusion is that, at the very least, he follows and enables racists. At worst, he is racist. I never said he was Hitler.

Once the nominees are decided? Sure. But plenty of people were, and still are, calling for the heads of those who dared question Hillary before the convention. The "moderate" republicans have fallen in line with the extremists for years, but somehow progressive democrats must compromise on every non-social issue to get, essentially, the right-leaning democrat in the White House, even before the convention? The democrats have a chance now to become real progressives and motivate people in order to improve their ground game for 2018, but they're too busy wishing that things would have gone differently. \n\n

More info on who he voted for:\n\nNikki Haley as UN Ambassador is fascinating since she's the child of Immigrant Sikh Indian-Americans. But she's a South Carolinian panderer; supported the Dixie flag until she didn't. Didn't support trans-bathroom inspections but checks all the other republican checks. Bad Vote.\n\nElaine Chao served with both Bush 41 & 43, so she's not crazy & she's also a child of immigrants (from Taiwan). But her Dad runs the Foremost Group, which is a big shipping/furniture corporation, as well as times chairing other American & Asian businesses. He's given tens of millions to her Husband, Mitch "The Turtle" McConnell, & the Republican Party. As Bernie would ask, 'Would you be here if your family didn't donate millions to the GOP?' Bad vote.\n\nJohn Kelly for HLS is a regular Military man moving up the ranks. He apparently knew & supported the Muslim Ban. Terrible vote.\n\nJames Mattis for Defense served under Obama as Central Commander. Bernie abstained & only one Dem voted against. Not the worst vote.\n\nMike Pompeo is Big Brother from 1984. Was anti-Snowden even though he used that information to vote against meta-data collecting. Otherwise he's pro-torture, pro-Gitmo, pro-black sites, etc. Terrible vote.\n\nCouple of grammar edits.

Maybe not replace, but Indycar needs to distinguish itself from anything FIA. The difference right now is regular Turbo-V6 to F1's KERS Turbo-V6. It won't happen in a Trump administration, but perhaps some time in the distant future, Indycar turns Hybrid or goes straight to Electric-only if Carpentier's correct about the improved development of batteries & motors.

A little bit off topic, but what is your opinion on the origins of Punk, UK or US? IMO the 'scene' and maybe the word 'punk' started in UK but Iggy Pop & The Stooges predate that. Are they too 'proto-punk' to be classified as the first punk band?

True, but situations like this make me want to be a little more prepared/knowledgeable. I'd thought I'd be able to handle a situation smoothly, but I couldn't control a level of panic. I'll speak with management, maybe we could have some emergency classes. Not sure what's up with the phones, if I was just panicking, but I'm not gonna try to call them now.

They were serving a restraining order I believe. He wasn't letting them finish. They were on the property without a warrant so he told them to fuck off. It's not smart to tell a cop to fuck off, but telling a cop to leave isn't illegal. Calling them fags and bitches isn't illegal but definitely triggered the cops to poke back.

With all the BS youre spewing, may as well take it a step further.\n\nIm calling Barca to do what Leeds did and wind up in the Segunda in a few years time. \n\nThe Spanish FA feeling so bad for Barca, allow the B team to be in the same division and even go to the division above them. Barca B rise up and take their place as a great rival to Real Madrid, and become the first club to win the Champions League twice in a row, all the while being managed by, you guessed it......Xavi. \n\nUnicef is dropped from the shirt and the club is being backed by human rights leaders Qatar Airways. Camp Nou is named Franco Qatar Airways Stadium.\n
More people would have likely died under a Cruz type plan.\n\nIts pretty great though, he frames it in a way that makes the current system looks bad, yet his would be worse. \n\nAlso the plan Bernie is proposing, based on other countries results, none of them would have died.\n\nGotta get them profits tho.
Yeah it was my first Mech, I loved the thing but it hasnt been used in months with the Varmillo VR68M I have now.
Whats the deal here, are you selling it or you got a 1080 for $350?
Different play style.\n\nPlaying for Argentina, I can't see Mascherano as a CB. There's no way it would work with how deep they sit.\n\nFor Barca he has struggled the few times he's been posted as a DM, while excelling as a CB.\n\nHe had a rocky start to the season but has kicked on since then.
Good point. I think Lahm had an easier time of it through being far more both footed than Sejo.
Are we seriously going through with this friendly?\n\nI thought this would have been canceled by now, just a ridiculous decision.
Typical, letting that one friendly go to his head and demanding a new contract.
If you use PWM fans, and just connect them directly to the MOBO, you can use the MOBO manufacturers speed control software, or use something like SpeedFan to control the speeds of the fan.\n\n\nI have a 1080 FTW, with the Hybrid kit installed, and thats how I control the speed. I just let the fan end of the card hang on the backplate.
No foul there, if anything the defender is trying to hold Dzeko with his arm. \n\nHe lost his marker and when his marker made the run behind him, he stuck his arm out to try to hold him, then the striker pushed the defender away. No foul.
Bernie just destroyed it with that point, glad it finally came up.
Id be curious to know what Doria thinks of him.\n\nHe was the most promising Brazilian CB of his age, gets a big move to Marseilles via their board, Bielsa comes in and he sees Doria as not one of his players and proceeds to bench him before being loaned out. Lucily he seems to have found life under Garcia, but those couple years could, and probably have put a decent dent in his potential career.\n\nI love Bielsa but feel for some players, the likes of Doria, who have been put in between his philosophies and the higher ups in the club.

These are the base prices I set. I'm completely open to negotiation and these prices are shipped as well. Also this monitor (the x34) goes for $1200 new and whenever it's seen refurbished it is sold out in seconds. \n\nYou don't have to buy it if you don't want to. But thanks for the input. 
That's a really good offer but no. The x34 is already sold. Thank you though.
You're joking right. The x34 never goes for that price. Even when refurbished it sells in seconds for 700 and up. If you're talking about the Asus one, then I honestly don't know the prices for it, but as I said before I'm completely open to negotiation and these prices are shopped. You can look at my history on this sub to see the prices I usually sell things at.

I disagree. I think Ted is doing better in terms of framing arguments, basically showing that he is a practiced debater, but on the other side you can tell Bernie actually gives a fuck about the average American. \n\nTed is winning if youre watching this to learn how to frame a debate, Bernie is winning by being a human and relating to the majority of the Americans.

I personally voted for Hilary but disagree with what you're saying. How can you blame a group of people who didn't vote? In fairness they should be voting, but if this ejection tells us anything, it's that the polls can be way off sometimes. \n\nYou should be pointing your finger at the people who did vote, Hillary, and the DNC.\n\nStarting with the voters. Something like 9% of Democrats voted trump, that is not the fault of anyone but the candidates running and the party. Blaming that on Bernie supporters is such a shitty copout for people who can't see the actual problem. \n\nNow Hillary. She failed miserably at getting to the typical Democrat voters. She assumed the presidency belonged to her from the start and failed to grasp that working people didn't want her NAFTA and TPP pushing bullshit. She's a center right establishment Democrat running a campaign that can only be won by someone on the progressive left or fake populous right, which is where trump stepped in.\n\nAnd you're honestly going for the argument of "Bernie voters didn't like her that's why she lost"... Please fuck off with that argument because it hasn't made sense in any point of this election. Especially considering so many of her voters were younger people while trump one the older demographic.
It's about the same ratio as unicorns to leprechauns.

Im doing a similar save, just with Parma atm.\n\nI managed to gain double promotions pretty easily and actually won Serie A in my first season, somehow the entire league was absolute shit that season.\n\nJuve finished 9th, Sampdoria finished 13 points off me in 2nd place, Inter finished 15th. The only sort of normal finish was Milan in 4th.\n\nI had no clue wtf was going on but took advantage of it somehow.

How much should I be charging? Again consider the fact that this monitor rarely is on sale new for less than $1100, and when it is on sale refurb or scratch/dent it is typically $800+, with very low stock, and the likelyhood of getting one extremely low. \n\nGranted the slickdeals argument is a good one, but if someone doesnt want to wait for a sale to purchase this, and even then would only have a very low chance of getting one at a decent price, then the argument doesnt make sense for them. And ive said it before, albeit I was downvoted, I am open to negotiations here, I did not say a definitive price and thats it, I dont get why the willingness to negotiate is so bad, what the hell do some of you people do when purchasing cars?\n\nAlso consider that this one has no dead pixels, some fairly normal backlight bleed for a 3440x1440 ips monitor, and one cosmetic issue that has no impact on the monitor (The problem of the front plate with the predator text not clipping in all the way).\n\n\nIll give it to you guys on the Asus monitor though, the original price was a bit too high, but even then this is another monitor that is rarely on sale, is 4k IPS with G-Sync which is pretty rare, and goes new for 800+. I lowered the price there.

So im using an Ergotech arm attached to the same pole for the top monitor to even them out.\n
Im not 100% sure how as I didnt buy the last couple PES games on PC due to the shit support by Konami.

They don't have a gsync option. Also their upcoming ultrawide options do not have IPS, only VA and TN panels.

I really hope this one is true.\n\nHe really is fantastic everywhere. Hes quicker than Pique, a bit taller than him, and can become as good as him with his feet. Hes certainly the best ball playing defender ive seen come out of the continent in a number of years.\n\nReally excited about this one if it comes to fruition. Tying him, Marlon, Bueno, and Umtiti together can build some tremendous depth in the backline for years to come.
Ok cool, yeah mine is a 2.0T so that should be a good thing. ill take that into account though. Thanks
No Josh, you wouldnt.

Yes you can. The same way people can get proper kits for every team. You can edit the kits yourself add to the game. You can't do it on console for a licensed team, but on PC you can.
Can we get a petition to have Ted start a movie review youtube channel?
You may be right, but you also may be wrong. Thats the beauty in talking nonsense about the future, you dont actually know, and youre making a guess on something that is up in the air.\n\nJust like there was talk of Spanish dominance in the Champions League being over when Barca and Real lost to Bayern and Dortmund a few years back.\n\nAnything is possible, but you are still spewing BS as there is nothing backing up your claim. Its not like Barca dont have great players coming up or the likes of Neymar still in the team, even when Messi leaves. He is the greatest but not bigger than the club. Did Real die out when Di Stefano retired? What about Barca when Cruyff left? Clubs of this stature have a propensity to stick around, especially with the commercial backing they have. \n\nBut oh well, Barca and Real will meet in the cup when Barca is in the Segunda, we can discuss then.
I get that, and it makes sense. If he gave in, a precedence would be set, but it still shitty as young player who was clearly good enough and almost tailor made for the system Bielsa employs, to be used as a tool to prove a point.\n\nI side with Bielsa on the matter, but I would be curious to hear Doria's thoughts on it, as I dont think he has spoken out on the situation at all.
They dont, they absolutely love that left lane.\n\nIts a really strange phenomenon in the US. The second so many of them merge onto the highway they do their damnedest to make it to the left lane, then slow the fuck down. There is absolutely zero self awareness of cars behind them, and when they realize there are vehicles behind, or passing to the right, they get pissed that you are passing. Its madness. \n\nLiving in the us for 16 years now, and its truly ridiculous the lack of driver education, and generally stupid driving rules. 
Well shes done.
Profit is bad when it dictates if someone dies or lives.\n\n> Do you know what happens without profit? Rationing, do you know what happens with rationing? People start dying.\n\nThis is not correct at all from the standpoint of healthcare. People dont die in any other major nation that has single payer healthcare. \n\nDo you know where thousands of people die every year because of a lack of healthcare? The good old profit loving USA.\n\nSo please gather your facts next time.\n\nProfit is great when the profit isnt from someone dying, be a fucking human being, please.

Is there any hard data on the average/median intelligence of Trump supporters?
[This Medium Article](https://medium.com/@VacationAway/trump-is-being-bribed-by-putin-d7270179f8d5#.gize40q3i) breaks down what is suspected so far.\n\nBasically; Russia helped swing the election for Trump (via hacking/blackmail) in exchange for Trump lifting US sanctions on Russian oil. The deal also allegedly gave Exxon/Trump a 19% share in Rosneft (Russian State-Run Oil Giant). \n\nThis is also the pretext (admittedly paranoid) for an oil war with Iran.

Not ensuring the welfare of those unwanted kids is part of the conservative plan, as is cutting funding and availability of proper sex education and contraception. Increasing the number of poor people is good for business. It lowers the cost of labor, increases the rate of crime, and increases the demand for guns and cops and drugs. \n\n*I just want to add that I'm personally not pro-abortion, but pro-choice. I believe abortions should be legal, available, and RARE. 
I'm not saying it's right. It is absolutely unjust and immoral. I am however saying that's how it is. The war on drugs was and is a smokescreen to continue the oppression of "undesirable" communities. From the horses mouth:\n“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”\n\n\n[John Ehrlichman - Nixon Admin. Domestic Policy Advisor](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nixon-drug-war-racist_us_56f16a0ae4b03a640a6bbda1) \n\n

Agreed. I would add using fossil fuels. I hope for a future where eating meat and driving petroleum vehicles is stigmatized like tobacco.\n\n\n* I don't think either should be banned, just prohibitively expensive/difficult. If you want to eat meat you have to hunt/process it yourself, and if you want to drive a vintage automobile you need to pay a carbon tax or make your own fuel.

The republicans have convinced their supporters that the only thing holding them back from becoming successful and wealthy themselves is government spending (except for the military) and other poor people (that don't look like them) milking the social safety net (welfare). Social Security and Medicare are conveniently and hypocritically ignored, as most republican voters (read: old white people) are direct beneficiaries of these programs. Combine this attitude with a few social wedge issues like abortion (against), racial and LGBT equality (against), and unrestricted gun rights (for), and you have the recipe to divide the lower classes, and conquer.\n\n\nTLDR: Republican voters feel oppressed when THEIR ability to oppress others is restricted.

I doubt this counts if you get shot in the head or vaporized, regardless Huxley is a badass.

the article may be wrong or overly confusing people. Russia has to get Crimea recognized as its territory by Nations that are able to stop its annexation. So if US recognizes Crimea as part of Russia it can petition better to have sanctions removed (maybe some how litigate against UN).

Not that I recall. Russia needs the world US included to recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Currently neither the US nor the UN has done that. 
People like to marry themselves to Ideas/things. When you attack that Idea then people feel you are attacking their personal Identity.

I think most people have an inbred sense of self preservation that could be traced back to the first mammals running away from dinosaurs.  So yeah there would be a few who would self sacrifice. Maybe a persons views/ideals could influence that sense. Maybe a Holocaust survivor promoter of science could have compelled him to self sacrifice.\n\nTL:DR\nYes only a few will
would it be fruitless if say a small business republican was forced to criticize these actions. said business person would have some sense of economic saviness. Its called cognitive dissonance what many some Trump supporters have. It is perfectly normal but damaging when one chooses a fiction over facts.

Yes it is a recorded time. Imagine 2 identical clocks. One stationary and other zooms past the stationary clock. Both clocks are were started at same time and both clocks are valid. But a phenomenon occurs when the moving clock feels/reads less time than the stationary​ clock. Since both clocks are identical and work there needs to be some explanation. There wrap around that
I like how Trump supporters (looking at you middle america) cant even afford the Ivanka Line.
mass only comes into play in acceleration. v is d/t (very idealized which is later added upon to include more complicated things). Special Relativity came out of Failling Newton physics (Inertial Frames) and dealing with the speed of light. Idk about mass recording the time but yeah one clock reads slower and both readings are valid
no you cant do that. Finish taking your lumps

I think you are getting US history wrong. Texas cecedded form US due to them finding gold. Mexico offered them to join and settlers joined to avoid US getting profit from gold in Texas. Later when Mexico tried to tax that gold It once again cecedded and wanted independence. There was a war between US and Texas. \n\nVery useful link explaining some of this\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S92fTz_-kQE\n\nNow with Crimea, There was I believe a vote to cecede from Ukraine or stay. and this vote was the one that was meddled in ( a coupe I believe) The people in Crimea did not receive a chance to decide.

>The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one's time defending scoundrels. \n\nThe difficulty we face when fighting for freedom is that we will spend a portion of that time defending people who are doing bad things. \n\n>For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all. - H.L. Mencken\n\nBecause it is against bad people/bad actions that oppressive laws are first designed for. However, once those oppressive laws are put in place, it's almost impossible to go back. So the oppression must be stopped before it is ever established.\n\nmaybe it's still a hard concept to understand.   \n\ne.g. Mass surveillance, warrantless search and seizure, War on drugs, taking your shoes off for security in airports, Department of Homeland Security, UK mass SPY law, etc. \n\n
If you lowball me, I'll raise the price out of spite to play games with you and not care if I sell. \n\nHowever, if you counter lower than the posted price, but within reason, that's basic negotiation.

i believe under Raw/Selvedge you should add  Unbranded/Naked and Famous as a single entry. They seem to be a staple around here and fit within the model.

>Hey gang, I used to be a pretty fashionable guy and then I put on a bunch of weight and stopped caring for a few years. I am about 65lbs (255-192)\n\nFirst off I got to say GREAT JOB getting in shape again, dont forget to do some strength training too. \n\nSecond, i also go through periods where go years without caring about my wardrobe and then one day I wake up and realize I need to update. \n\nI'm new here but the concensus seems to be that you can get some reasonalbe basics at places like Uniqlo for not much money. I think that's the best option to start out with due to your potential for dropping more weight. I'm 6'1 180 and I wear a medium in Uniqlos oxford button downs. I like Uniqlo's chinos in the Slim fit and they have tons of basics you can pick up for cheap and not worry about growing out of or not liking. \n\nSo grab some Olive or blue chinos and a cheap pair of indigo selvedge raw jeans. Next throw in a knit sweater (mostly wool blend) a cotton throwover and if you can afford it move on to shoes. I would recommend a nice oxford (e.g. Allen Edmonds Park Fith Ave) or perhaps a nice casual workbook to wear with your jeans/chinos. \n\nAnyways, im sure there will be some other great suggestions but those are a few.

Melissa as Spicer is the only thing good about 2017 so far
sometimes it's about sending a message. Currently Congress is passing a law that would make it illegal for investors to sponsor law suits (e.g. peter thiel sponsoring the lawsuit against gawker cause Hulk had no cash to do it). The bill is undoutably sponsored by large business looking to limit their risk when they go off the rails. \n\nThese lawsuits are as much about sending a message to this publications that if they are going to ruin somebody's life or release a sex video that they better accept the consequences.

Honest, probably wouldn't have reported this guy. I'm pretty forgiving though. This guy just seems to have been venting after he tilted in the early game. No racism. No death threats. No blatant trolling. Just a tilted player desperately trying to get on to the next game.  \n  \nAll I see here is enough salt to make the dead sea taste fresh by comparison.  \n  \nLouie will probably get away scott free here.  \n  \nNot saying he's in the right.

Confetti? Is there a story to this?
The paladins consequence is exactly the outcome. He just unleashed a horde of *murderers* as a follower of the God of Life.  \n  \nWait until you see the PCs reaction to this atrocity caused by his own hand.  \n  \nThey will most likely beg their god for forgiveness. They will desire atonement. They will want to undo what they've done.  \n  \nI'd go so far as to allow a Paladin of Devotion to become a Paladin of Vengeance until they atone.  \n  \nAfter they atone, they make a choice. Do they continue hunting those the god of life opposes as a vengeance paladin? Or do they return to their ways of Devotion, spreading their gods word and turning to violence only when necessary? \n\nOn a side note,  can a follower of life even kill?

Rape is a dangerous subject to tread upon, but its portrayal in modern media and television shows like Game of Thrones make it more likely to come up than is often comfortable.  \n  \nI believe you have a very mature consequence planned for the player. DnD is, after all, a game of action and consequence. It will definitely change the dynamic of the players character and he will either learn and grow or die in his stubbornness. \n  \nMy advice to you, and I use this for my games as well, is to do your best to keep sexual encounters out of the game if you can, but if you do keep it short and lighthearted. \n\n"You find a whorehouse easily enough and your night of banging finds you down 50gp. Make a CON check." This will tend to get you a few laughs. \n  \nDo not under any circumstance let this player RP a rape. An "OK, that happens," is more than enough. Move on as quickly as possible. And honestly, let that awkwardness sit in the air for a bit so hopefully he learns it's not ok.  \n  \nTLDR. Tell him no. It's fucking disgusting and you won't have it in your game. Especially if there are female players in your group. It's just disrespectful. \n

I going to be opening a small business soon. Personal training in a group setting. Similar to Orange Theory Fitness.

Omg. Right there with you mate 
Mechanically, i understand where you're coming from, but casting of spells and attacking are typically relegated to EKs and Arcane Tricksters. Also, fast casting spells is a Sorcerer thing. So you'd be stepping on their toes so to speak as well.  \n  \nSpeaking of which this opens a viable option for your feat. Martial adept (i think) gives an player a single maneuver die and access to Battlemaster fighter maneuvers. This same feat can be duplicated for the Sorcerer's spell points.  \n  \n**Sorcererous Adept**  \nWhen you take this feat choose one of the sorcerer's metamagic abilities. You gain a single charge of that metamagic to use as you see fit. This single use ability recharges on a short or long rest.  \n  \nThis would allow your players to forgo their ASI in order to have a single use of subtle cast, quicken spell, twinned spell, etc once per short rest. Something to think about :)
Mechanically, Grog only needs 13 Dex and 13 Wis to multiclass into monk. If I'm not mistaken, he definitely could.  \n  \nBut Travis has said in the past that monk is a bad fit because Grog loves his toys and would probably not be willing to give up his weapons.  \n  \nHe may be unaware of "monk weapons" though.
Thordak ain't the only one spitting fire

I feel the need to pipe up for the barbarian, because my Frenzy Barb is my favorite character I've ever dreamt up.  \n  \nYes. I live to smash things. Nothing is more satisfying to me as a player than rolling those dice and seeing damage fall. My maul is everything to me.  \n  \nYes. I do not get to Frenzy very often, but in my opiniom the Frenzy barbarian would be devastatingly broken if I could frenzy consistently.  \n  \nBut when I do Frenzy, those are some of the most thematic and cinematic experiences I've gotten to enjoy in DnD.  \n  \nA personal favorite of mine was during a 1 on 1 gladiator style match. Because I was frenzied I got to use my action for ANYTHING other than an attack. This meant if he tried to run I could always Dash back on top of him and get a swing off. If he tried to stay up on me, I could Dodge and still pummel his puny face in.  \n  \nIt's been my most treasured OH SHIT button for over a year.  \n  \nAnd the charm immunity. Good god, the charm immunity. Beats bearbearian hands down, any day of the week. And the flavor? That I hate this son of a bitch so much that I am so dead set on bashing his/her face in that I find any sort of reasoning incomprehensible? Ohpls.  \n  \nMy one gripe is Intimidating Presence.  If it was based off STR (imposing fear via giant hulking muscles) it would be the greatest ability ever.  \n  \nFrenzy. Strike fear. Bonus face bash. Good. God.   \n  \nI've played my frenzy barbarian from level 1 to 12 over the course of a year and a half. God damnit I wouldn't change him for the world.  \n  \n(rant over. Sorry if that got a little winded. I just cant understand the hate aside from powergamey numbercrunchy nonsense. And after, consistently, feeling like I do the most DPR in a given fight - the numbers argument goes right out the window.
It's referred to as the right to privacy. First mentioned in the Supreme Court case of Olmstead vs the United States in 1928. And was officially recognized in Griswold vs Connecticut in 1965.  \n  \n> The Court said that the *First Amendment* guarantees the right to peaceably assemble, which includes the liberty of any group to associate in private.  \nThe *Third Amendment* prohibits the government from quartering soldiers in a private home without the consent of the owner.  \nThe *Fourth Amendment* forbids the government from performing warrantless and unreasonable searches of any area in which a person maintains a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \nThe *Fifth Amendment* safeguards the right of criminal suspects to keep secret any incriminating evidence that might help the government obtain a conviction against them.  \nThe *Fourteenth Amendment* prevents states from denying its citizens certain fundamental rights that are deemed essential to the concepts of equality or liberty, including the right to autonomy, dignity, and self-determination.\n  \nScoff however you want, but yes, my right to drive my vehicle down a road as a fish bowl or with 99% tint on my windows is constitutionally protected. Those same rights protect you as well and permit you to share your opinion and disagree with mine in a public space.  \n  \nYou don't have to tint your vehicle's windows. You can tell me I shouldn't tint mine. But it is unconstitutional for you or any government to attempt to force me into that action.

Welcome to League ARPG. Our story begins in the dark and mysterious past..
First off I loved the episode and Matt is the greatest DM I've ever witnessed. But in the same way we can pick out mistakes made by professional athletes, so too can we with Matt.  \n  \nThat being said, this hyper perceptive, super intelligent, demigod dragon not only focused nearly every strike he made on theit tankiest PC, but he didn't utilize his flight at all.  \n  \nA dragon fought outdoors should have been in the air out of range, recharging its breath weapon and then doing flybys.  \n  \nAlso, and I know it probably would have been too strong, but I believe Thordak should have had the Elemental Affinity feat attuned to fire. Being a magma dragon, demigod of fire, and the constant descriptions of "white hot heat you've never been exposed to before" leads me to believe they should have bypassed resistance.  \n  \nTLDR - playing to his strengths, Thordak would have absolutely annihilated VM. 
Really the only hints we have here to reduce her stat values are Melora's Curse that we have no info on and the possibility that Raishan received a negative mod to saves against the Spire of Conflux.

Well that's up to you unfortunately. Nobody knows your character's personality better than you do. The githyanki will probably appear sooner or later and demand the sword back from you peacefully  (hopefully with an explanation as to why).  \n  \nIf you refuse, they'll try to fight up for it. One or two will probably try to retreat from a losing battle to inform their people you won't give it up without a fight.  \n  \nNext time will most likely be an ambush of githyanki assassins.  \n  \nThird time will be the last straw and theyll send their biggest squad/baddie with a vastly powerful item (possibly cursed) to try and trade you for the sword.  \n  \n If that still doesn't work, they'll send a messenger of some sort, requesting your demands for the blades return. \n  \nIf you made it that far without dying, I'd need some time to think about it as DM.  \n  \nEdit: or you know, you could just give it back. 
That seems way over my head. But it sounds like you know what you're talking about so let me ask you this if you don't mind.  \n  \nI recently purchased a 970 to replace the 280x and it has a tendency to put random black checkerboard effects over windows. Also, in games like League of Legends, there's often large, distorted textures that string themselves all the way through the game.  \n  \nI don't mean to bother you for tech support, but I'm pretty convinced after several driver reinstalls and that gpu driver wiper program that this card is defective AF.  \n  \nThanks again, if you do have any tips :)
**Servant of a Dark Order**\n\nYou were either born a street rat or fell on hard times. Perhaps you have someone you need to find or are hiding from a greater power or person of authority. Whatever the case, you were picked up and cared for - taught by this order. They serve a god. You serve that god. And this god demands the swift, secretive taking of lives. Who were you before? Do your goals line up with this orders? Only time will tell.  \n  \n**Possible Class:** Rogue, Monk, Fighter\n  \nThe acolyte background is not one I see used very frequently and one that I find dripping in flavor. This background is versatile enough for many members of the order to have vastly different goals, pasts, and reasons for belonging to the cult. Rogues and Fighters can get very flavorful using one of their many asis for the magic initiate feat or half caster archetypes. This also can give the Actor feat some real use! The order can be a great plot hook source for a DM as well.\n  \n**Character Inspiration:** Dark Brotherhood from Skyrim. Arya Stark and the Many Faced God from Game of Thrones
This seems very involved as a feat. I think a more balanced version would be to swap the actions as a weapon attack is much less involved in comparison to what a spell could do.  For example:  \n  \nSpell Blade:  \nYour magic and weapon strikes dance seamlessly together in combat. When you cast a spell in combat, you may make a single weapon attack as a bonus action. You may use this feature once per short rest. Your uses increase to twice at 6th level, thrice at 11th level, and 4 times at 16th level.  \n  \nPersonally, i dont think a weapon attack is too broken and I would allow it frequently.  \n  \nAnother approach:  \nWhen you cast a spell at a higher level than its base, you may make a single weapon attack as a bonus action.
>"I do not believe I have the right to privacy."  \n- u/cray0508 \n  \nWhy would any right minded human being argue that they had less rights? 
If you have the Shield spell learned already are you allowed to take magic initiate for an additional, free use of Shield per day?

The annoying fan. Usually a young, naive NPC who is absolutely enthralled with the party. He knows every feat, every deed, every story, and every song. He wants to be like them. He wants to join.  \n  \nAfter constant pestering, getting in the way, and accidentally breaking a magical item or two in his clumsiness the party will eventuallu get sick of him and send him on his way.  \n  \nScorned. Broken. Cast aside by his lifelong idols. He turns. Sometimes he joins up against the BBEG, betrays the party, or becomes the BBEG himself.  \n  \n*"You said I wasn't good enough. But you were wrong. You were all wrong. It wasn't I that wasn't good enough for you.. No.. ****You aren't good enough for ME!***
My family overnighted me something like this while i was out of state. I don't know if food will survive overseas but I'd send:  \n  \nBagels. \nPizza. \nGarlic knots. \nI'd hit up an NYC gift shop and grab an I ♡ NY tee, a shot glass, maybe a yankee/met hat, and a few other goodies.  \n  \nHonestly if NY pizza knots and bagels can make the journey it's all they could ever want. I know it was for me!
I'll give you an example and then break down the mechanics.  \n  \nRogue pops out from behind a tree and fires a crossbow at the party, then uses a bonus action to hide. Fighter runs to the tree she shot from to attack, and shes gone. He looks around, spots her and alerts the party.  \n  \nMechanically, she's stealthed behind trees because her stealth roll beats the party's passive perception.  \n  \nShe attacks, hits, and hides. She rolls stealth to hide BEFORE she makes her movement. If she beats the party's passive, they don't see the next tree she moves to.  \n  \nFighter runs up to the tree she fired from, but due to her high stealth roll she was able to move unseen. Fighter makes an active perception roll as an action and spots the rogue.  \n  \nParty has an idea where she's at, so they'd get advantage to try and beat that previous stealth score to spot her.  \n  \nIf they don't, rinse and repeat.  \n  \nIf she rolls low on stealth, whoever's passive she beats will see what tree she moves to.  \n  \nTLDR: the bonus action stealth to hide amongst the trees would hide which tree she moved to next. Fire. Hide. Move to next location unseen. Repeat.

Lifting and stretching will do wonders for your posture. Of course, see a doctor if any of your postural abnormalities are causing you pain or interfering with your everyday life.  \n  \nStatistically speaking, if you are constantly slouching and at a desk you will most likely have forward rolled, high shoulders and an anterior pelvic tilt.  \n  \nStrengthening your rear delts and traps will do wonders for pulling your shoulders back into place. \n  \nGlutes, hamstrings, and entire back will do wonders for your pelvic tilt which is forcing you forward.  \n  \nStretching the opposite muscle fibers will also assist in pulling everything into place as your tight shoulders, hip flexors, and lower back are being strained by these postural issues you're having. \n  \nTL;DR. Focus working on your rear delts, glutes, hamstrings, traps, your entire back (specifically the lats and lumbar) and and abs.  \n  \nFocus on stretching your hip flexors, front/medial delt, traps, and abs.  \n  \nIf you need a workout recommendation, feel free to ask. I'm a certified ACE personal trainer and am currently studying for a degree in Physical Therapy.  \n  \nDisclaimer: Please know that this cannot be taken as medical advice and is strictly my opinion based on personal experience.

Wow. Its been almost 50 episodes since then? Incredible.
scene 1: interrogation. Barbarian with flaming codpiece stands before a single man. The man is bound to a chair. A gag around his mouth. He is bloodied and bruised. A lone lantern dimly illuminates the moss covered stone walls of the surrounding sewers.  \n  \nBarb: "Talk. Or I'll kill you."  \n  \nNat 1.  \n  \nThug: " Ha. You stand there before a beaten and broken man. You think your flaming cock can intimidate me? No. The men who sent me could do far worse than you ever could. Make it quick. Make it slow. I don't care. All I know is you won't get a god damned thing out of me.  \n\nAny other attempt to speak is meant with stoic silence or insults.  \n  \nScene 2. The party stands before the body of the thug they murdered over a spilled drink. The captain of the guard storms in from the screams of the patrons.  \n  \nBarbarian: Back off, or you're next.  \n  \nRolls 1.  \n  \nGuard Captain: I knew this bar drew a shadier crowd, but never in all my years have I been greeted with such arrogance. I was going to have you turn yourselves in peacefully, but it seems, instead, my men and I will be turning your corpse into the morgue.  \n  \nDM: The guards draw their weapons. Roll initiative. Idk how you're gonna get out of this one boys.  \n  \n**TLDR** Don't think of it as "how can this end poorly?" Think of it as what is the absolute worst case scenario of this social encounter?  \n  \nA Nat 1 could be circumstantial as well. Maybe a failed intimidate causes the victim to start screaming for the guards. A failed persuasion could cause the merchant to double all of his prices for the party. A failed deception could cause the NPC to become infuriated by their attempt at deceiving him.  Crit fail=worst case scenario. Not "you don't scare me fire dick man!"\n  \nIn the guard scenario perhaps because of the barbarians badass appearance, the captain tells 2 of his men to "get everyone." And they take ofd running. Now the captain's goal is to fend off the party until the more powerful guards show up with the big guns to take down this villain.
played **Quantum** with 4 for the first time at a buddy's. The game is amazing. It's a space based, colonize the galaxy type strategy game. The rules are short and simple, but the strategy and depth run DEEP.  \n  \nEach player receives 1 of 4 color player cards. They receive 5 jumbo six sided, beautiful, transparent colored dice. The dice act as ships and each die number represents a different ship with different abilities.  \n  \nEach player gets 3 actions to move their ships, battle, and try to colonize the most planets first.  \n  \nThere's PVP, deep deep strategy, and tons of backstabbing. I love it.

I make my own due to getting horrific migraines from C4 and NoXplode. A lot of the preworkouts on the market use cheap fillers, malicious ingredients labelling, and amphetamine-like additives to try and give you the best bang for your buck.  \n  \nAfter my research, and what works for me, 10 minutes before the gym I take the following:  \n  \n1G Beta Alanine - this is a beta blocker. Laymans terms it increases carnosine levels of your muscles and increases muscle endurance\n  \n3G L-Citrulline Mallate - this stuff is SOUR. Put simply this is a Nitric Oxide producer and vasodilator allowing blood to enter your muscles and carry nutrients much more effectively, reducing lactic acid buildup and increasing power and endurance.  \n  \n1.5G Betanine Anhydrous - this is derived from beets and is fantastic for muscle synthesis (the actual development and repair of new muscle) I take another 1.5g post workout.  \n  \n200mg Caffeine pill - roughly 2 cups of coffee, feels like a slow release that offers sustained energy throughout my workout.  \n  \nTheanine I believe its called is derived from tea leaves and could be used to supplement or replace the caffeine as they complement each other well.  \n  \n**TL;DR** I take 1g Beta Alanine, 3g L-Citrulline Mallate, 1.5g Betaine Anhydrous and a 200mg caffeine pill pre workout with 10oz water 10minutes before my workout.  I'm 5'10 and 160. Though the dosages are lower than most recommend, it works for me. Keeps me motivated, focused, hardworking, and I havent had a migraine in over a year since switching from store bought shit.
Your character probably knows nothing about the sword or the githyanki, so nothing currently.  When he learns, you react accordingly
Something tells me he could republish it with a bit of rebranding. Perhaps changing the title from Gunslinger to Gunsmith. Any mechanical updates could be argued as unique class features for an unrelated class.
I'll look into these. Thanks!  \n  \nIf i had to find the simarities between these two games, I'd have to say that it's the ability to manipulate the other players. In coup we get to lie our asses off. In Quantum we get to lie about our next move and talk up strategies about white cards we don't want so nobody takes the ones we have our eyes on.  \n  \nBasically, PvP and manipulation is where we shine. We don't mind longer games so long as everyone's turn goes by quickly and there aren't dry spells from other players thinking or tons to do each turn.  \n  \nTL;DR we love to fuck each other over and have short attention spans
Thanks for the recommendation! How much longer we talking? What's an average game normally run you timewise?
This was my favorite by far.  \n  \nThe King had called everyone in the kingdom to the capital for a great census, an accounting of all the citizens of the realm.  \n  \nNobody in the party knew each other but were conveniently close as they approached the main gates. The guards seemed on edge, but nobody knew why.  \n  \nJust as they were entering the city I unleashed utter chaos. Zombies and undead tore out from beneath the city and started ravaging everyone and everything.  \n  \nThe PCs were literally fighting for their lives amongst the insanity. Shoving zombies, dodging falling debris and hunks of building being thrown by zombie ogres.  \n  \nOne of the more noble of the party ripped open a sewer grate and started calling for innocents to get inside to escape the inevitable.  \n  \nThe whole party, luckily, decided to follow suit.  \n  \nAnd so the campaign began. 4 strangers trapped in a sewer beneath a sea of undead - surrounded by the wails of the innocent as their capital city crumbled above their heads. And at level 1.. there was nothing they could do about it.  \n  \nIt went so well. 
When building a caster you're more often then not looking to taking one or two core damaging spells that fit your theme and the rest are utility.  \n  \nWizards have more utility, but i would say a sorcerer's subtle spell gives them infinitely more utility.  \n  \nThere's nothing like casting a spell nobody can detect was actually a spell.  \n  \nYour wizard will always be stuck with a spellbook in his/her hand, making grand somatic gestures, and shouting arcane gibberish.
Could i trouble you for that information as well? 
**Coup**
You can certainly try ;)
[This scene from Sherlock Holmes](https://youtu.be/BGCMfprPJoA) should be a great example of how your intelligent barbarian fights. It's often described as "cold rage"  \n  \nBasically, the PC takes less damage because he sees each shot coming and can calculate the movements necessary to avoid or soften each blow.  \n  \nHis damage is increased because this calm, calculation of each movement of combat lets him/her identify the enemy's weak points and moments when they over extend themselves.  \n  \nYou could also go for a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  take where he's calm and precise until he loses his temper.
They seem to be.. changing.. in fact upon further inspection they don't seem to be pigs at all anymore! Whatever fluid these creatures have been coated in seems to be changing them. Their coiled tails have straightened out and pointed. The fibers of their muscles have swollen and the veins seem to almost painfully pulsate across their bodies. You look beneath the cart and the creature seems to have completely evaporated into smoke. It shifts out from under the cart before coalescing nearly 60ft away. And with a squeal, it takes off down the street!

I believe magic duels work perfectly well in the 5e system. It's just up to the DM to keep things intense, respond quickly,  and to pressure the players to react instinctively in the heat of the moment instead of methodically. Heres an example of combat and the description between PC and NPC.  \n  \nInitiative:  \nPC 16\nNPC 9\n\nRound 1:  \nPC - Fireball. \nNPC - Counterspell, Protection from Energy (Fire)  \n  \nRound 2:  \nPC: Fireball. \nNPC: Failed save, resistance, +lvl Magic Missile  \n  \nRound 3:  \nPC - Twinned Firebolt, Counterspell. \nNPC - Shield, Lightning bolt. \n  \nDescription:  \nDM -You both stand in the arena, arcane energy crackling at each of your fingertips, staring each other down. You both eagerly await the gong for the tournament to begin. Roll initiative.  \n  \nPC- 16!  \n  \nDM- At the sound of the gong, you're the first to react. Without a moments notice, you spring into action. What are you casting?  \n  \nPC- Fireball his ass!  \n  \nDM- Quick as a whip, you conjure a small ball of fire and hurl it in NPCs direction. It swells in size as it soars across the battlefield. About halfway through though, BOOM! It erupts halfway between the both of you,  scarring the battlefield and actually transforming some of the sand of the dusty arena to glass. He anticipated your spell, and countered. He then presses a hand to his chest and you can see a bit of frost beginning to coalesce on his robes and flesh. He's waiting for your next move.  \n  \nPC - Shit. Ok. Fuck this guy. I launch another fireball and sprint along the edge of the arena.  \n  \nDM - You take off in a mad dash along the arenas edge, dust kicks up around your feet with each step and you feel a warm wind rush past your face as you let loose your second blast of flame. *rolls* and it connects full force! Roll damage!  \n  \nPC- 38!  \n  \nDM- Nice! There's a MASSIVE explosion. The fireball travelled so fast NPC didn't even have a chance to retaliate. A massive crater is left where NPC was standing. And as the flames and smoke settle, you see him at its center, standing tall with a slight smirk on his face. His robes and skin are damp, looks like the frost resisted quite a bit of the damage. He predicted you well. And as he tracks you with his eyes, he doesn't miss a beat. He begins to lob missile after missile of arcane energy in your direction and they soar through the air, tracking you down in your sprint around the arena. All 6 collide one after the other, POW. POW. POW. POW. POW. You take, 12 total damage and are nearly knocked off your feet by the last blast. What's next?  \n  \nPC- Shit. This guy doesn't fuck around. Okay. He's got counterspell, whatever he cast before looks down.. so I'll just hit him with something he cant block. Twinned firebolt! 15 and.... 26!  \n  \nDM- High rolls! roll damage for each. Continuing your dash around the outskirts of the battlefield you let loose a massive bolt of flame that soars through the air like a missile toward NPC. The force of the first thrusts you back and you turn on your toes, using the momentum to fire off a second. Both look on target. But! At the very last second, a frosty barrier is conjured by NPC! The first firebolt explodes against it, shattering it to pieces but shielding NPC from the blast. The 2nd however plows forward striking him in the chest and setting his robes aflame. What's the damage on the 2nd bolt?  \n  \nPC- damn. Um. 11!  \n  \nDM- He clutches his chest, covering his singed flesh that's exposed through his charred robes. Still standing in the same spot. You see his eyes begin to spark with electrical arcane energy, he moves his hands behind him and prepares a great blast. You can see a massive ball of arcane lightning begin to dance around his arms and hands, arcing to the arena floor. He thrusts his arms for-  \n  \nPC: Counterspell!!!!  \n  \nDM - Good call! He launches a bolt of arcane lightning and in an instant this massive thunderbolt is traveling straight for you,  luckily you saw the prep and recognized the spell. Mid sprint, your hands begin to arc with their own electrical energy and just as the bolt is released you thrust them forward, knocking the thunderous bolt skyward. Theres a massive boom as the energy is dispersed and NPC stands there, still clutching his chest, looking rather impressed. What's next PC?  \n  \nSorry for the long story, but 5e DOLPHINATELY works for magical duels :)
You should include current quest objectives, motivations, etc in the pre session recap.  
Thematically, I see no problem.  \n  \nMechanically, you'll take away the struggle of dangerous terrain. There won't be any frozen, shivering nights in the tundra or blistering, desperate camps in the desert because the temperature will always be adjusted.  \n  \nAlso, my players would try to summon it in the air, drop it on someone, set a trap with it, etc.  \n  \nThe campfire spell is called Bonfire.

Unfortunately, that's just the nature of the beast that is league of legends.  \n  \nLeague is a game that is incredibly deep for how simple it seems on the surface. Many small mistakes early compound and snowball out of control late game. Not to mention these small mistakes are much more difficult for low elo players to notice and capitalize on due to their subtlety.  \n  \nThis lack of understanding and inability to carry causes immense frustration to someone on a losing team. Being stuck in a 40 minute game that one sees as hopeless compounded by the rather intense punishment system that is ELO is a recipe for high strung, frustrated players and a tendency of lashing out.  \n  \nThe problem is, these aren't issues I can see league fixing in its life cycle. And there's no way to change the mentality of a playerbase with millions of players between the ages of 10 and 90.  \n  \nTL:DR Losing in league feels awful. Every game is going to have a losing team. Every game is going to have 5 losers. The probability of one of those 5 stressed, frustrated players lashing out in all chat is nearly guaranteed. Especially when it boils down to the players trying to figure out what went wrong and blaming everyone but themselves. \n  \nYou want to be a better league player? Don't say "fuck this vlad just died to riven for the 6th time. Gg." Rather, adapt your game and your strategy.  \n  \nVlad scales hard. He'll be fine by level 18. Regardless of how many times he dies in lane. Riven is fed. Guess what she's going to do? She's going to roam. Most likely mid lane. And from there to bot. Her job is now to snowball her lanes. Your job is to survive into the lategame when your power level catches up to hers, and to capitalize on cocky riven mistakes.  \n  \nSo, we can say GG riven fed. Or. We can remind midlane not to push because riven is on her way. If we're a jungle we can take river scuttles to give a window of opportunity. And watch that area of the map. Don't trust other lanes to do their job. Ping when top goes missing. Ping when mid is missing. Ping when your scuttle picks up riven in the river.  \n  \nNow that you know riven is mid, push the advantage. Shove top lane, shove bot lane, back for items and go mid to defend.  \n  \nMany players make even more mistakes and tilt even harder in a losing game because they take risks to try and become the carry.  \n  \nThis is becoming a HUGE wall of text so I'll stop here. If there's interest,  i can make a post about how to come back from a losing game and how to deal with fed players.

Scry.  \n  \nGo to their last seen location and search for clues/tracks.  (Survival, Perception, Investigation)\n  \nUse detect magic there, if you can't find anything. Look for magic.

Things will continue to get more expensive regardless of the shrinking buying power. \n\nLook at CEO salary increases over the last 20 years versus worker salary increases over the last 20 years and ask yourself how the people at the top can afford to make so much more without paying with people at the bottom any more. Then you realize you just answered your own question.\n\nThe idea that prices will not increase as long as we keep wages stagnant is not even laughably naive. Its proven false.

Here's the thing. Those social safety net programs are being destroyed from the top down, along with education, infrastructure and everything else that we expect from an even basically functioning government. Most of the Republican base depends on one or more of those programs, as they are those low income rural working people, yet they've been taught to hate and seek to destroy those very same programs that they depend on. The Republicans shred the policies from the inside out, slash the budgets and then turn around and go "see these don't work."\n\nBut here's the really fun part. They then support things like abstinence education, defunding Planned Parenthood, taking condoms out of schools, and making birth control pills require parental sign-offs for people under 18. This is a perfect recipe for teen pregnancies, which creates a bigger demand for social safety net programs. They're doing everything they can to force their base to be dependent on the very social programs that they are destroying, while simultaneously convincing them that it's everyone else that using the programs and that they are getting robbed.\n\nIt's easy to criticize the Democrats for not just dropping the whole concept as soon as the Republicans were able to fuck with it, but then why even show up to work?\n\nThe people who voted for Trump because they wanted him to drain the swamp and end the system they should have paid attention to what each party was doing. Saying they were pissed off doesn't justify it. Being pissed off and uninformed just means you're dangerous and easily manipulated. At some point do we not expect personal responsibility? They continue to vote for things that keep themselves and the rest of us down and then destroy the very things that could help them out of the bad situations they put themselves in, and then we're supposed to not call them stupid? Sure okay they're not stupid they're misled, uninformed, irrational, and maybe even delusional, but they're not stupid.

You got a good point it should be illegal to cut off someone's foot, but perfectly legal to cut off someone's toe against their will, since the two aren't comparable. \n\nIf I were to tie you down and cut off your toe with a scalpel you'd still be able to walk, probably even without assistance. It certainly wouldn't be as bad as if I cut off your entire foot (which is already illegal), therefore it should be legal for me to cut off your toe, since the two aren't comparable.

http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Moria\nHere's the wiki page but I'll tl:dr it for you\n\nIn the first age, the Dearves wake up a bit after the elves. The greatest of them, Durin, wakes up in the north, and wanders southwards until he reaches Mirromere, a still lake on the eastern side of the misty mountains. \n\nIn this lake he sees a crown of stars appear over his head, which inspires him to build Khazâd-dum (which is more commonly known as Moria, meaning "black pit").\n\nIn Khazâd-dum there is this amazing metal called mithril which can only be found there, as well as other precious minerals, and the hall prospered throughout the first, second, and most of the third age.\n\nHowever, in the third age, the miners dig deeply, and woke a Balrog, a demon from the first age. It killed the king and his heir soon after, and it had to be abandoned.\n\nThere was an expedition to reclaim Moira 2 times, once the was the greatest battle of the Dwarf Goblin wars which is recounted in "the hobbit" movie where Thorin's father is killed, and later by Balin, which is the group we find in LotR when the fellowship goes through.\n\nAfter the destruction of the ring, another expedition is lead, this one successful. And the dwarves lived and thrived there until the world faded away and Durins folk were no more.

Nope, look at the other pictures on the lego site, that's supposed to be the house. Yikes
Yeah I like making it too! Plus it's delicious IRL so I actually like farming it in game too. It's hard getting enough coal though
That's a LOT of pieces for something like that. It would have to be at least 60$ by the .10$ per peice rule of thumb. Also, the house is too smooth. Lego doesn't make models like that. Lego buildings need depth and accents. And finally, there's nothing really iconic about that house right there. I honestly thought it was the chicken coop.

The whole point of lego ideas is that you see a mostly finished product. When it hits 10k, they review it, make some changes (usually make a bit less detail and remove any "illegal" brick connections), and then its all set. With the quality that makes it to 10k, this will get nowhere near that. I agree someone should make SDV legos, but it shouldn't look like this

My favorite is M2, but as another user said, if you wanna do coop, you'd be better go with R2 or S2, I'd recommend R2. Shogun 2 is more... pure? Since it focuses on Japan alone it's sorta Rock Paper Scissors with cavalry infantry spear men. And there's nothing like sending a full legion into battle!
I really understood the books and movies more after playing medieval 2 total war with the "third age" mod, not a rpg but it's soooo fun being the dwarves and reclaiming khazad dum!

Oh man I literally just read a TON about this.\n\nI still need to read the sillmarillion, but I read most of the wiki pages.\n\nSo in the beginning, there were 7 (male) dwarves that were created by the god Alue (spellcheck?). The main god told Alue they were cool, and they could be part of the world, but they had to wake up after the elves. So all of the dwarves were put to sleep with a dwarf wife, except Durin who was alone.\n\nSo Durin wakes up along with the others a bit after the elves, and Durin eventually wanders to lake Mirrormere, a lake on the east side of the misty mountains. He looks into the lake and sees his reflection with a crown of stars above his head. He realizes he's destined to start the greatest dwarf hold, and he makes Khazâd-dum, nowadays known as Moria.\n\nThis Durin was known as Durin the deathless, and I recommend the song sung by Gimlee which tells his tale, [here's most of it performed by Peter Hollens](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MlqG7B598XI). So Durin the Deathless (he lived a long time) eventually dies, but it's fortold he'll wake up again one day. \n\nSo fast forward, and eventually the Dwarves dig to deep in the ground and awake an ancient Balrog, and Khazâd-dum is kill. And then those refugees go on to make the hold in Erabor, the lonely mountain and you're all caught up!\n\nSome stuff i don't know a ton about, like when the dwarves fought the fire drakes in the north, but I think this is a pretty good TL:DR for Dwarf history!\n\nOh and towards the end of the history, Gimlee founds the cave colony behind the hornburg, and the dwarves reclaim Moria where the Dwarves live there till the ending of the world

Neat. Inb4 best of comment on the front page tomorrow. Also, enjoy your inevitable gold. What do you do for a living by the way?
That's a LOT of pieces for something like that. It would have to be at least 60$ by the .10$ per peice rule of thumb. Also, the house is too smooth. Lego doesn't make models like that. Lego buildings need depth and accents. And finally, there's nothing really iconic about that house right there. I honestly thought it was the chicken coop. If you want it to do better, you need to have a defining characteristic of stardew valley somehow

Credit to /r/midjuneau for posting this to /r/space! It reminded me of Mirrormere, the lake on the Eastern side of Khazâd-dum where it is said Durin, the first king of the Dwarves, looking into the waters at night and saw a reflection of 7 stars form a crown around his head, inspiring him to build the great Dwarven hall which would become Moria

I hate small talk, it doesn't interest me and just keeps me from asking what I really want to know. One trick I have learned is to ask more open-ended questions, like instead of saying "What do you do?" I say "What do you do with your time?" this has two advantages because the person can interpret the question any way they like. \n\nI am probably not interested in what they do for a living so asking this tells me what they really feel like they are doing with their lives. I often get fascinating answers which leads to more questions.

Ugh, I just helped a friend with a build last night after he had already ordered everything. It took about 8 hours in all because he just ordered shit without a lot of research, it was not a fun build but in the end we were successful.

They have a year long return policy, and I went with the intention of spending more money for this trip. (Trust me if I wasn't unemployed at the time I would of kept the cot) The trip fell through so I returned the stuff I didn't need and bought my cot back. \n\nEdit: I have spent tons of money with REI and am a member, this is the only time I have done this but I am sure there are plenty of people that use it like a free year long rental.

Well, I think love is imperfect and will always be accompanied with doubts. I don't think you have to settle for anything less than someone you would give an honest shot of going the distance with. I think people spend too much time thinking about what else is out there and fail to appreciate what they have, that ended my last serious relationship.

P. Terry's is the best value burger in town IMHO. I have had a few inconsistency issues when new stores open but they are expanding like crazy and that's understandable. I eat there about twice a month for my fast food burger cravings. In n Out just makes me need a nap afterwards.
Holy shit I have never seen those. Might be a little after my time. 
Which is why you see paper plates, EVERY DAMN DAY.
They are actually kikwears, everyone in the original thread was hung up on them being JNCO's. 
I am totally part of the problem, I bought a kingdom three cot, used it for a year. Returned it, then bought it again at the garage sale for cheaper. 
Me too, thanks.
In America, Movie theaters are more subjectable to lawsuits and having customers walking around in the dark with 140 degree coffee could be a saftey hazard.
Literally spend thousands in a store. Take advantage of their return policy once, am a shit head for life. Got it. 
I definitely know what you're saying, I get so frustrated at my situation regularly and take it out on whoever listens which is normally my poor sweet mom. I hate when I do that.
Yeah, it is still okay but it is a lot more mainstream now. NPR normally wins on my commute.

This is me, I am becoming bitter. I have been battling my Bi-polar disorder for ten years now and out of all the conflicts that have taken place, I am just angry and bitter. I am a being of love but I am becoming so hard around the edges.
I would wait until after the Superbowl not before.
I have been with a partner in an orgy before if you are wanting to know. I fucked three different women, she fucked different guys, our relationship didn't work out. I don't know if I would do it again but it was still fun banging a bunch of random chicks at the same time. 
Good job putting a ring on that one OP.

Oh yeah I forgot I had 420 in my name lol. It's really just satirical. \nI'm not bitchng about the behavior of this whole subbreddit man! I love this subreddit. I've been subbed for a year now and it's one of my favorite subreddits. I'm purely "bitching" (more like disagreeing but if you want to call it bitching then fine, fuck.) with the comments on this one post. I think there's a lot of bullshit in this thread. What's with the unsubscribe suicidal bullshit? I never once did anything remotely like that. You're the one who told the guy "So, uhh, leave." But I understand why you said it now cause he was pointing out that the entire subreddit is like this when in reality it's just this one post. But dude. Can you ageee that this one post is full of some wild ass assumptions about whole groups of people just like how /u/RedRedawan did to everyone in the subreddit? The thing that I hate most is generalizing things and especially people. I feel like you can agree with me on this. 
Are there many people you think would pay good money for a strapping young man such as myself for those same acts? I have dope feet.

But can you imagine if you did it so that the camera gave you a 3rd Person angle of your own life? Holy shit that would be crazy to experience man. Especially after a few days. I wonder how much that would effect you. It would even change your dreams into 3rd Person if you did it for long enough! You would be looking at the world from such a different point of view If you were looking down on yourself. How could we achieve this? I guess you could use a long metal mount to put on your back that would go about 3 feet above you and 3 feet behind you. That'd be insaaane. [7]

The dude said some bullshit about "Women have an inflated sense of entitlement" and that made me the most upset. Like, damn. This whole thread is too hard for me to read. I gave up on replying lol. Then he has the gall to call me out and try to turn it around on me by saying that I'm just as bad as the generalizers I talk about because "I'm generalizing all the people who generalize as "bad people."\nAnd in this case? Yeah, I kind of think that they're bad people. 
I completely agree that that's fucked up man. It's just that, my pet fucking peeve is when people falsely generalize a whole group of people, and throughout this stupid post is a lot of comments doing just that. Making huge assumptions about things and people that  they only have few experiences dealing with. I like hearing your opinion and i do agree. Girls do that, guys do that, some girls don't, some guys don't. It's fucked up to play with people in general, and if you do? You're a bad person to me. It's as simple as that. I just think there's a lot of crazy people in this thread that are spewing hate for whole groups of people, when god, man. We're talking about people. People living lives just like you're living your life. There's such a broad spectrum of humans in this world and people lump them all together into categories they created from their personal experiences. But hey! I'm not saying that you yourself are doing that. I barely know you, and you can believe whatever you want. I'm just saying that THATS what I'm dealing with/thinking about going through this thread. 
The fuck? Okay, go eat a bag of grapes, dick.
We got an old saying in our bush. Sometimes life gets you down, all you can do is put on a brave smile. Take a fuckload of MDMA. Then you're walking distance from the beach. Doesn't matter where you live, you got enough of MDMA, you're walking distance from the beach. Just don't forget a towel.
Yeah man. We can both agree it's a bunch of bull. I see it in every thread\nBut I'm not mocking anybody yo. I'm sorry to fight, I think I'm just getting really tired of generalizations in my life. People do it so much and they don't even realize it. 
I didn't know about Redpill until today! I went there and I was like, "Holy fuck these people have legit problems forming relationships"\nYeah, it must be really hard to form a relationship with a person when you think of them as some sort of sentient being that's only goal is constantly aiding only thenselves instead of an actual real life person lol. I think they all have severe trust issues.
Haha I didn't even think about that!! 😅 Sorry mann. You know what I meant lol
Have you said this comment in another thread before?? I'm seriously curious if you're the same guy lol. I've seen a comment say the exact same comment you did except it was "An extra curvy piece of driftwood." instead.
"I'm going to save my babeh" 
Oh my god dude. I love Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Ever since Sky High. She's so damn beautiful it's stunning. 
Haha noice.
Are you saying that Aunt May from the Tobey Maguire movies was hot? \n\n\nYou wouldn't be wrong. 
Awesomesauce.
Oh my god, Cole Hersch. If that is you I will legit freak out. If not, that's the first time I've seen Cole Hersch referenced on Reddit, and that makes daddy soooo pleased for his little cummies. Even if you didn't mean to reference him that's still so great lol. He's a Vine star turned Snapchat star and he's fucking laugh out loud hilarious. Sometimes he does a Daddy bit and it's legit the scariest thing I've ever seen on Snapchat. I highly recommend him @colessnarpchart
It's a fuckin metephor dude 😂\nBesides we're talking about a lot of different things here man. \nI'm not talking about pure biological imperatives. What I'm saying is that a lot of the comments in this thread are using biological imperatives as an excuse to be chauvinistic as fuck. 
Doesn't that just make you cringe so bad?! 😭\nI went crazy in this thread because so many red flags popped up to me lol. I usually don't even have arguments on Reddit all that much. \nPeople aren't sane.
I'm honestly just wondering what you were trying to say now though. I was on the defensive because it seemed like you were implying that woman were unique in that aspect over men. By asking me if I disagreed that "Women, given a wide choice of possible partners, will tend to get the best they can get." It sounded like that. So you can understand how I thought that way. Especially with our topic of conversation in this thread lol. Yes, I agree with you then. "Best possible partner" as in a partner that they could see themselves personally being with/fucking. \nAnyone, given a wide choice of possible partners, will tend to get the best they can get.
I really, realllly like Dev Patel as an actor. I never watched the film, but I feel like he would have been a far better Sokka over Prince Zuko. Dev Patel is an excellent actor. I highly recommend the movie The Road Within in Netflix with him and the guy from Misfits
Case in point
That's awesome! It's about time they made it a little easier to encounter a Shiny. Even if it's only a bit of a higher chance for Zubats/Golbats lol. Definitely gonna evolve it to see the Shiny Crobat. Sounds super cool to me. 
That's literally like you being a Catholic and me being an atheist and you say to me "Just because you don't believe it doesn't make any of it less true." I don't believe it in it. It does not exist to me. I don't condone this type of chauvinism lol. Your comment is the type of stupid mindset that stunts everybody in the world. 
I prefer "The Cat's Pajamas"
This made me laugh out loud. Gotta love surprise Courage The Cowardly Dog references lol
It's such a broad spectrum of people man. I'm not going to generalize like you right now.
You said that "Women, given a wide choice of possible partners, will tend to get the best they can get." And I disagreed, because men do that too, just like women do. 
Also, his Stand-up "Weirdo" is seriously one of the funniest Stand-ups I've ever had the joy of watching lol. 
I think he'll snarl in a menacing way throughout the film and it will be really cool looking. I imagine the nose would come out as a lot more "Beastly" and less human-like. That's my hopes at least. I would love a sick Gaston VS Beast scene like at the end of the original. To Gaston, The Beast is just a animal/monster for him to hunt. I'm hoping it works out. It's a beautiful story. 
If you go on IMDB the oldest age for Kate, Kevin, and Jack were all age 15 in that episode. Which is fucking heartbreaking if it's right. But I do remember them fighting at the Footballgame when they were older than 15, at least. 
Do you know that as factual? Or are you just saying that? Because it seems like you're just saying that lol. If you're right, well then that's fucking amazing, but I would love some proof.
That was... Brilliant. Truly.
Holy fuck! That dude's insane. I just looked at his comment history. Thanks for letting me know lol
Lolol yeah it was confusing when I typed it out for me too.
That is special, man. Awesomeness. I started playing Pokémon at 6 years old and I'm 20 now so 14 years for this dude! 
All I know is that there needs to be.
You swear?! That's so awesome, man. 😅 Thanks for helping write one of kid me's favorite shows. It really stuck with me. As did Lilo & Stitch. 
I think it's a toxic mix of fedoras, perverted men, and probably some normal guys that just want her to know she's beautiful because she said she wasn't half as hot.

I guess you're right man. I was thinking about a comment someone else made on this post. There's a lot of crazy close minded comments on this post though. It's  ridiculous and i'm sorry to lash out at you specifically. 😅
I don't even fucking know... A whole bunch of shitty chauvinist comments here if you ask me. 
I agree! 'Tis a fucking silly place. But why tell /u/RedRedDawn to leave? Also, you say that like smoking weed is a bad thing. 😂 Like its demoralizing to my person. What are you in the 6th grade or something? 😭
Dude! What's up! I'm back to say that I literally just realized what the title is saying. It's not talking about Daniel Stern lol. The Co-Star is the spider! I don't know why I couldn't see that earlier. The Spider Resurfaced after 26 years. 
I didn't even know where to start on replying to that dudes comment cause it was so fuckin flawed. You said it very well. This thread is honestly toxic.
Thank you for being so passionate about Coyote Peterson. Brave Wilderness is the shit. It really filled a place in my heart left by Steve Irwins passing. Coyote Peterson is always as psyched as Steve to teach us about Wildlife. I love his channel. I highly recommend it to anyone. Watching the Chanel grow and gain subscribers is awesome. He deserves all the recognition he can get! Even if it isn't Coyote in the picture lol. I just watched his video with the Sea Hare's too! It was great
It's still working boys!!
Ohhh, Bessie.
Wow! It's a Sailboat! 
I think that you're 100% correct, and it's not cheesy at all lol.\nI have people in my life, smart people I might add, who use that base instinctual/biological "Warfare of the sexes" all the fucking time, and it's honestly so hard to listen to them babble on and on about it like we're the same exact people that we were 10,000 years ago lol. They LOVE to use that excuse, but only because it perpetuates their close minded/stereotypical mindset. I read 10 freakin comments about it in this thread... it's hilarious. You'd think we would all be smart enough now to know that "Primal instincts" don't even count for 10% of who we are as people. The same people who say that genetics plays a part in who we pick as partners THAT MUCH are the same people that say that genetics plays a part in why black people are "more aggressive than white people" 😂\nAnd it's that type of thinking that I think stunts us so much. To the point where we've got people in this thread who have never had real relationships say that "women have an inflated sense of entitlement" because they themselves just honestly aren't good enough people to get any "pussy" lol
Just say "Fuck the Lemons" and bail. 
CUT MY LIFE INTO PIZZAS\nTHIS IS MY KNIFE AND FORK
That is so fucking amazing! Oh wow, this is exactly what I was hoping for with the new movie. I really really hope they pull this off. I could only imagine it as either a TV miniseries like Stranger Things, or as a 2 parter. So hearing that this is the way it will be made is fucking fantastic. 
Noooo some villain needs to use his powers for evil 100% \nI wouldn't like if if he was all angsty. I mean, he could be a little angsty, but I don't think him going dark side should be completely his doing. 
Every post in this thread are just wildass assumptions. \nYou don't know these women dude. Maybe they just don't want a fucking relationship? Lolol you're lumping a whole group of people into a category and that's just a ridiculous thing to do. \nThere are a whole gigantic spectrum of completely unique people that use this app for completely different reasons, and yet you say that none of the women know how to get a relationship? That's a bullshit statement and you know it. At least I hope you do.
How is it any fucking different for the opposite sex? \nYes, I disagree. Because we ALL do that. It's not just women. Plus you're talking about finding a partner in its most basic form when in reality there's a hell of a lot more that plays into it. Especially when it comes to forming actual relationships with people and not just hooking up on Tinder.
Oooo well then I can't wait to evolve it. I'm trying to  actually Catch em'\nAll in this game lol. 
Fucking badass, man. You inherited those genes too ',;) \nI hope I live to that age. He's a marvel for sure.
What the hell is he even going on about? That's crazy talk/psychotic babble.
To be honest I didn't mean to come out as hostile at all lol. 😅\nI'm just extremely, extremely excited. His comment was pretty short with no information behind it,, and I was just sorta jonesing to find out if it was true or not lol. People comment things they don't know all the time. But it's my fault for having not heard that it was going to be two movies amidst all the discussion about the movie recently. If you read my comment in a more upbeat way I promise that's the way I was trying to put it guys. 
Good to know!  I was curious as to whether or not anybody has had the same happen to them. It seemed too good to be true. Like it wasn't exactly uncommon for Golbat to be a Shiny in Sun & Moon lol. Still super cool
What the fuck that's a ridiculous statement lol. That's seriously exactly what a chauvinist would say, and I'm a guy. \nYou're all being stereotypical as fuck. 
This isn't /r/theredpill you fiend. 
Your truth is not the truth for me because I do not fucking believe in it dude. Your "obvious disparities" are not obvious disparities. They're just completely mute.\n"Not true, women will always keep a retainer of men ready to pick up the slack when their first choice inevitably pumps n' dumps them." \nDo you honestly believe that this is factual for all women? Or are you talking about a subset of women? Because if you believe that you're a manic and you should crawl back to /r/theredpill \nI'm not going to watch /r/Tinder become a fucking circlejerk for close minded individuals. 
Mooooooooom

Yeah, it is. CarsThatDrive is just kind of dumb. You know. Like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory. 
Haha this was too perfect lol
What the hell is going on in the YouTube comments on this video lol. 
You wanted to see his shit. 
I'm glad you did, hopefully they'll reprimand him somehow. Hoping none of that nonsense goes on anywhere else, best of luck to you, OP ^^and ^^happy ^^belated ^^cake ^^day!!
And that's an opinion, can't argue what others like.
Haha, well, "There's Dozens of us!!!" Nahh, but seriously there's a lot more than dozens lol. A lot of people loved that show. I remember not being able to wait to see the next episode just so I could see what Jumba's next escapee mad scientist creation was!! I always wanted to be a mad scientist when I was younger lol. The TV show for Lilo & Stich was a dream come true to kid me because of that. 😅 I completely adored the movie, and the Spinoff movie, too. So thanks. I'm 19 now haha. It's kinda crazy. 
 I'm gonna say your comment instead of mademoiselle from now on lol. "Metamucil?"

Nice comment history. 
So what percentage have Unnatural Green Eyes??
I'm so sorry to hear that. Sounds so traumatic. I can't imagine that happening to me at that age. Happy to hear that he's happy despite the incident.

Haha yeh.
I just can't understand the people who are going around this thread downvoting anyone who says any word of good about this type of lifestyle change. What the fuck is wrong with people? This post is so, so inspiring. People make me so saddened. For real. One post said that this is a "Mental Illness" and yes, maybe a mental illness exists where someone doesn't feel comfortable as their born gender, but this girl is the happiest that she has ever been in her whole life probably. Her whole life. Right below us in this thread are two comments "Wonderful!! Truly wonderful!" and "Congratulations! You're cute as a button!" and they both have 0 points purely because of one person's hate. The problem is that, that one person's hate stands for the majority of people, and that majority are so wrong it pains me to see comments of such kindness treated this way. Can you believe your post was -2 points? God, it hurts so much.

At least you said please.

The only reason I would call you an asshole was if you *stopped* calling him and proceeded to tell him "all the information is on facebook, dad." It's different if he's just now interested about wanting to talk on the phone because of your dog, but if you used to have weekly calls and you stopped because of the predicament with your dog, there is spare time where you could call and give him updates and the dog and your's well being. For now though, I don't see any assholes.

"I'm sorry, it seems you've misspelled the email address you've been using for the past 5 years, let me fix that for you"
I don't think he was poking at you, dude. More like a realization that you're not a teen asking this question. If anything, man, being open and honest about your feelings is something you have to deal with. She knows you like her, just say something along the lines of what /u/The_Foe_Hammer said. That's if you're still trying to be friends with her, and I hope to God that you are if you're this into her. Avoiding people like this makes them suspicious, especially if you talk to her on a normal basis and all of a sudden she's not getting any replies. She'll understand.

I only bring it up with my partners if I know it's something they're into. A majority of the women that I've been with are pretty vanilla, and there's nothing wrong with it, but I tend to be pretty kinky and like toys and restraints in the bedroom. I know it was all done with good intentions, but some people don't really like that it. I wouldn't try and convince him, maybe talk to him more about it. If anything, wait a bit, he might bring it up himself because he's warmed up to the idea. Also, avoid that numbing stuff for anal. If it hurts that much, you're doing something wrong, and with it being numbed, serious damage could occur and you wouldn't know. Good luck, OP.
4/10. Thicker frame or no glasses and keeping your hair shorter would definitely be an improvement. Try and smile a bit more too, everyone looks good with a smile.
Woah, woah, woah. Just off the bat, I'm a 20 year old male from the NJ, living with a conservative Christian family and being told from when I was younger that only successful relationships come from two people who are virgins. My parents, both Christians, weren't virgins when they got married (and my mom had my sister unwed 10 years prior to me, who was also born before my dad married my mom.) This type of mind set, shit, it's a hard one. Please, talk to your therapist about it, he can offer a lot of help. Now, from my personal experience being a believer, there's no such thing as damaged goods, and you will not be looked down upon by anyone that's interested in you for not being a virgin. Like quite a few people have said, your family has a very skewed view of sex and how it impacts relationships. I'm glad you have an understanding of your self worth, but please don't ever think that just because you have sex with someone you're worth any less than you were before. I wouldn't ever say to jump right in to a sexual relationship, just whenever you feel comfortable with it. Hopefully your dating life can prosper with your family around and I wish you the best of luck dealing with this problem. If anything, I'm just another voice on the internet you can rant to if you're ever feeling down and out. Best of luck, OP. No matter what, you'll always be loved. Edit: Some spelling errors

You've got no info here, buddy. Sounds like parents being parents. Judging from your post history, you're pretty angsty and should probably look at some professional help. Take a seat and just breathe for a bit.

I walk around my own home naked, however, I close my blinds. People tend to walk around and just look, catching a glimpse of a naked dude can be, well, unwanted. Understandable if it's dark out and yeah it may be your own living quarters, but I'm pretty sure you can get in trouble for it. Not 100%. Just common courtesy, bud, keep those windows shaded.
Holy shit, dude. Well, how's your bro doing now? Do you make jokes about this at all or is this more of a traumatizing experience from when you were younger?

It's all good! My apologies for the snarky remark. I shared a top level comment that explained my thoughts a little more. Not everyone is adventurous in the bedroom, and that's 100% okay. I've been with a few people who I've explained my kinks to before who were either: A) Ecstatic that I'm a guy who is switch with both male and female partners or B) Get kind of freaked out because I like butt stuff. Either way, I don't ever press the issue if its something they're uncomfortable with. Sex is supposed to be fun, and regardless of whether it's cookie dough or vanilla, it's still enjoyable. No one should be put down for what they do or don't enjoy in the bedroom.
Personally, I think it would look great using black and gray to add "color." You can do some really interesting stuff with the negative space around your tattoo. Compliments to the artist!

Well, just like a few people said, I'd work out the "Monkey's Paw" clause that a cursed item like this would have. Then, I'd remove my dependence from the book itself, granting me the power to manipulate it's powers with my mind. *However*, I am one to think outside of the box on occasion, so before removing the book's blessing from the book itself, I would set up a phrase that I would need to write on *any paper* before my wish could be granted. This allows me to use the book without consequence or the worry that I might possibly bring Giants, Dragons, or Beelzebub to life in front of me by accidentally conjuring objects through excitement and wonder. Then, I'd wish for myself to be elected President in 2020. That way I'd be one step closer to the one thing that pushes many towards positions of power...

The reporter referenced by OP was from CNN, not BuzzFeed.
"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."\n\n\n ― Martin Luther King, Jr.
How about older returns that are no longer under audit?
I'm not suggesting that.  I'm arguing that some poor people have legitimate reasons as to why they struggle to raise their kids and that statements discussing trends need be prefaced as such to avoid painting an entire group, in this case poor people with kids, with a broad brush.
One of the biggest criticisms I've heard about the VA is that they aren't firing underperforming employees.  This hiring freeze will make them much less likely to fire those employees since an underperforming employee is better than no employee at all.
>Just because it's statistically unlikely doesn't mean we should ignore the problem\n\nAgreed.  However, shouldn't that influence how we prioritize it among our other problems?  Something that unlikely doesn't seem to warrant  being our #2 biggest concern.
How about his tax returns that are no longer audit?  Also, why has Trump and people in his campaign given other excuses if it really is all about the audit?
Russia wanted someone who would keep Trump from launching nukes.  They don't need to destroy our military to accomplish their goals.
I despise the Koch Brothers but I've never heard that they were strongly anti-Muslim and/or anti-immigration.  I don't see what they stand to gain from this ban.
You don't have to watch CNN to come to the conclusion that Clinton would be a better president.  Watching Trump speak at rallies and reading his tweets is more than enough to convince me.
You'd think someone in his position would shoot for a higher bar than being better than that though.
[This guy](https://timenewsfeed.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/trumppizza.jpg?w=455)
Some of the bloodlust in these posts is disconcerting. 
I'm confused.  Why would the intelligence agencies fix the errors?  Wouldn't that compromise the report?
Does it matter?  In these areas in the US, it's mainly Christianity.  Poverty is the main cause of these troubled areas not religion.
Probably but I wouldn't count Gebbia out.  The only major knock I've heard about Gebbia is that he needs to put on weight.  I believe he'll be in contention if he's able to do that this spring/summer.
And the Republican that replaced him wouldn't love coal just as much or more?
They want to play on hard mode? 
Romo would allow them to remain competitive while they search for a long term answer at QB.  I think getting rid of Cousins is a horrible idea but if they are going to do it, I don't think acquiring Romo is a bad option.
Part of that is due to them spending all their time working to put food on the table.  Pretty difficult to raise kids under those conditions.
The source is the article:\n\n>Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials.

I decided to create a subreddit to hopefully get the ball rolling on organizing a march in support of a free press: /r/FreePressMarch.  If you are interested in helping to run the subreddit send me a PM me.
He's the owner of the website.  I find it difficult to put any stock into a news site that is run by someone who talks about gay frogs and believes Sandy Hook is a hoax.
I think you are underselling her speaking skills.  She gave probably the two most powerful speeches in the entire 2016 election.  The 2016 election showed that charisma is the most important quality a candidate should have and she certainly has it.  She is far from my first pick but she may be the most electable.
I wouldn't completely dismiss anonymous sources though either.  The associate director of the FBI was the anonymous source that broke Watergate.  The most trustworthy media rarely cite anonymous sources that aren't in a position to know what they are talking about.  Completely making up an anonymous source would put them at risk of a major libel lawsuit.
They'd likely be banned from the sub.
Easier said than done.  Sometimes the kids are planned but their situation changes. \n\nI won't make excuses for shit people but I'm also not going to label everyone in poverty that struggles to raise their kids as shit people.
So you propose we divert money from other areas to maintain the wall?
His question was directed at OP but he piggbacked on your question since non-supporters are not allowed to have top-level comments.
I would hesitate to assume much about their upbringing.  Plenty of serial killers had normal upbringings.
Exactly. Rightly or wrongly he believed Clinton would be better for the country so he continued to support the party.  That's pretty admirable in my opinion.
His tax returns.
Anyone opposed to Trump should be in a position to call themselves 'The Resistance'.  There isn't much room for infighting if we want to have success fighting Trump.
That wasn't in the report.  Trolls are releasing fake snapshots of the report in an attempt to discredit it.
Can we try allowing some political posts on a temporary basis and/or let users vote on it?  Judging by the comments, most disagree with this rule.
Sounds like he may be [removed from office](https://twitter.com/JoeDugganOWH/status/823942488792727552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).  This same moron used a state computer for cybersex in 2015.
America's integrity went down the drain the moment Trump was sworn into office.  
I just don't see a trade that makes sense unless the Spurs trade Parker and I don't believe they are willing to do that.
Mount & Blade
My point is that everyone's situation is different so nuance is required.  Labeling an entire group as shit feeds into the dangerous us vs. them mentality.  Some poor people are shit and others aren't just like some rich people are shit and others aren't.
The only way I see us having a chance is if Pop is able to develop a time machine for Parker and Pau to use.
Your prediction looked dead on a few games into the season.
They reported on the story before Buzzfeed.  They also didn't report the specific details of the memos. They only reported that it discussed compromising info and that our intelligence agencies found the sources credible enough to brief Obama and Trump on it. 
That's a fair point and he has done/will do things worthy of greater criticism.  I just don't want complaints like this to be dismissed/marginalized because they reflect behavior Trump has demonstrated in the past.
What makes you say that there is a good chance he is already in US custody?
Isn't he Tyjon's cousin?
You're hilarious:)
He'll get a shot and if he shows promise he should at least get a spot on a practice squad.
Trump is now going to count on Chevy to power the economy.
>He was definitely ahead in terms of vision. But name me 3 accomplishments that he has over Trump.\n\nHe taught constitutional law for 12 years, was a state senator for 8 years, and was a senator for 4 years.
>“The law is probably about right, that’s probably roughly the right age. I think it’s probably about okay, but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger. I think it particularly happens in the gay world by the way. In many cases actually those relationships with older men…This is one reason I hate the left. This stupid one size fits all policing of culture. (People speak over each other). This sort of arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent, which totally destroys you know understanding that many of us have. The complexities and subtleties and complicated nature of many relationships. You know, people are messy and complex. In the homosexual world particularly. Some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming of age relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are, and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable and sort of a rock where they can’t speak to their parents. Some of those relationships are the most -”
Didn't the Guardian endorse Bernie in the primary?  In either case, they've been much more pro-Bernie than most of the MSM.
This was during the campaign.
They had some of the info last summer.  I can't speak to the quality of our counter-intelligence but assuming Russia covered their tracks well, it is probably extremely difficult to verify.
I'd put Chris Jones ahead of Morgan.
Yeah, I'm thinking Falcons as well.  I know I tend to scream more when my team does something bad than good.  Since all his screaming was in the second half when the Falcons were falling apart it would make sense that he was Falcons fan.
He holds the Arizona state record for career receptions.  
I don't understand how it helps us.  We have plenty of oil here that doesn't require using soldiers or crossing the Atlantic to acquire.
Why hire him over Belichick?
The media makes mistakes and certainly has biases but you shouldn't outright dismiss everything they report because of it.  They are one of the only groups that are capable of holding Trump and the rest of government accountable.
This may end up being the biggest accomplishment of his Presidency.
I think you misunderstood me.  I was jokingly suggesting that Trump might do something like that.  I strongly prefer Pence at this point.
Yeah, I don't think we'll ever see a team blow a lead of more than 25 points.  They'd be the laughingstock of the nfl.
They are doing something.  They are working on verifying the information.  They are can't act on unsubstantiated information. 
Trump 7:11
That's one of the few things he could do that would cause his diehard supporters to turn on him.
That doesn't seem to make sense with the times she listed.  The game went into overtime shortly after the Patriots tied it up.  The forty minute gap would line up better to when Julio made a big catch for the Falcons.
I understand that but I think we need to recognize that it is not normal presidential behavior and continue to call him out on it.  His supporters should criticize him for it as well.  You can criticize someone for some aspect of their behavior and still be a supporter of that individual.
That press conference was unpresidented.
It's not out of character but I don't believe it should be accepted and normalized.  Also, I've frequently heard it argued that Trump would act differently once he is president.  This is evidence that he is not going to change as president.
Sounds like we need to organize a free press march.    \n\nEdit: Created a subreddit /r/FreePressMarch  
I bet he is the one that pushed for this.  Bannon is effectively running the country at this point.
No.  Disagreed strongly with many of his policies and his corruption, bigotry, flip-flops, and tweets were major turnoffs.
Since time is relative, it could also be timer.
Issue a sincere apology for all the wrongs he's committed during his campaign/presidency and resign.  That probably wouldn't cause me to switch sides but I would at least respect him a little for it.
And likely [more Democrats stayed home than Republicans.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voters-who-stayed-home-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/)
And when he doesn't, you'll support his ouster?
According to the article, it still exists but employees must get approval to use it.
I'm confident he won't start a war due to a tweet.
I don't know why people keep suggesting that the Democrats need a celebrity.  They would have won this past election in a landslide if they had run someone like Biden.  Also, people are going to be sick of having a celebrity president if the next four years go how I think they will.  The Democrats need someone with charisma but they are better off going with an established candidate with qualifications than a celebrity.
Why did Trump say "You've got to see this guy" if he had never seen him before?
In any other case, I'd agree.  However, given Trump's track record with appointments, his next appointment will inevitably be a substantial downgrade from Mattis.  I think having a competent, intelligent SecDef that will to stand up to Trump is more important than the civilian control of the military principle.
It's not as if the Patriots have gone up against a lot of good offenses.  
CNN reported that the unverified memos contained compromising information and that our intelligence agencies found the source of the information credible enough to brief Trump and Obama on it.  However, they did not release the memos or discuss their specifics.  I haven't followed exactly what The Guardian has reported so I can't comment on that.
It certainly was about a lot more than that but they definitely were an important factor.
According to the CNN story, the FBI already had most of the information McCain gave to them.
He also threatened Iran.  It would not surprise me if Trump initiates a war with them.
Not really.  His versatility is very limited.  He wouldn't be effective at all in any defense besides Bob Sutton's.
You can push back against the idea that the press is "the enemy of the American people" and still believe that it is flawed and in need of reform. 
So Christians that don't follow the Old Testament and/or believe that that the Bible shouldn't always be taken literally aren't the "best" followers?  
I remember the Oklahoma State game several years ago where the fans released the balloons when we finally got a first down :/
It helps that he just hired an elite offensive coordinator.  I think he'll do fine if he lets his coordinators do their jobs and focuses on motivating the players and recruiting.
Regarding Nebraska, it sounds like Lee has the edge but if it does end up being a battle I think our incoming QB recruit Gebbia will also be in the mix.
I love that this story is dropping the day before he is set to hold his first press conference as President-elect.
Do you have a link for their primary endorsement?  The endorsement link you provided was for the general election.
I think "Make America Great Again" should be the election slogan for 2020.
How so?
Nowhere in the article does it say that they received death threats.  Do you have a source for that?
I'm guessing it was Julio's big catch to put the Falcons in field goal range.
I believe I'm arguing that the age of majority should be 12, or so, because a 14 year old wouldn't seem like such an idiot anymore if they were respected as an adult and allowed to learn as an adult from the time their body decided they were an adult.
Sounds like a special snowflake for having emotions and cares about reality.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
He built an entire presidential campaign on his ego. He's makes all his money for being who he is. If he resigns and shows everyone he was in it with Hillary, he'd be done in America as well as the rest of the world. He needs a scapegoat of some kind that dulls the blow enough to leave ambiguity when he's removed.
That *real* men sign up for war and realize the horrors of existence that ultimately result in their much higher suicide rates.

Look at some children in war-torn parts of the world. We'll have our first-world citizens jerking off all over them, no pedo, like it's some sort of American Idol bullshit with a 3 year old who can play Mozart just because we see a video of some 8 year old kid covered in dirt who talks like an actual cognizant entity, unlike the little fucking diabetes spawn we have in America. \n\nWhy? Because a kid in a region with war has extreme pressures to make them more mature. Yeah, that's a bad thing. I admit that. You know that and would throw that at me. But that's not my point.\n\nIf that's possible, why the fuck don't we even *attempt* to teach kids about reality? We act like innocence is some sort of gold mine that the pedos are trying to plunder. Fucking throw that shit out. Teach kids logic. Get them thinking about the realistic magic of technology and science. Make them desire things that are bigger than us. We act like sexuality is the super secret prize these kids should spend their lives trying to unveil. Fuck everything about that.
Is everyone really falling for this so easily? The media proved they're corrupt. This engineered Russian bullshit can only be explained as another matter of corruption.
Pretty sure he's been recognized more and more lately, fuckwit. Add in population growth and internet discussion bringing him up every 10 minutes and I couldn't be more right.
Ra-Ra-Rasputin Russia's greatest Top Ra Men.
At that tier, women know how to capitalize on their resources.
When was it that people were lynching negroes and taking pictures with the whole town, including children, next to the body to use as post cards?\n\nThat's a great one. Suprisingly popular activity, too. Of course "I didn't do it," is all we'd see from far too many white people facing that blame today.\n\nThen, ironically, they go on to blame all Muslims for this, or all blacks for that. Incredible how depraved people can be, including through ignorance and negligence.
>> We act like innocence is some sort of gold mine that the pedos are trying to plunder. Fucking throw that shit out.\n\n> Uhh, that's exactly what pedos do. They take advantage of a child's innocent to plunder them sexually.\n\nSo you think children are a gold mine for sexuality? Innocence wouldn't be a gold mine for plundering if we didn't keep children innocent. Teach them reality. When they get to adulthood at whatever age their sex organs decide, they'll know exactly why and when they'd like to consent to something.\n\n>>We act like sexuality is the super secret prize these kids should spend their lives trying to unveil.\n\n>You seem to have very different ideas on how society views children, and children's relation to sex.\nAnd I would not like to have someone like you around any children I know.\n\n/u/CptNasty, I'm referring to these children as human beings. When people treat sexuality like it's some sort of untouchable evil, even beyond childhood into adolescence, when these individuals are actually reasoning and feeling these things directly, it sort of constricts these people to feeling like sex is only allowed for "adults." \n\nSo despite their urges, and will 100% *full* disregard for how these kids feel, we want to restrain them completely from what they'd like to do. Not even inform them properly enough that they could make the decision, but simply say they aren't capable of making decisions for themselves. What does that teach a person? Does that teach respect? Or does it teach arbitrary laws? Or does it just teach religion-like adherence to arbitrary laws? Which one is the good outcome in your mind? Because it's definitely not respect.\n\n**Edit:** Since the comment was deleted, probably since I made a gif joke that was seen late, I don't want to waste this whole comment I wrote up:\n\n/u/Spacejack_:\n\n>Regardless of your position one way or the other, I admire your steadfast refusal to abandon good-faith argumentation in the face of open well-poisoning.\n\nI try my best to keep things focused on argument, but it gets so difficult sometimes. When I see a topic like this that just pulls in automatic emotion, I have a hard time catering to people. \n\nI often think sexuality, and particularly sexuality involving young adults, to be one of the most interesting moral arguments, but that's mostly just because so many people have incredibly rigid attitudes about things already. That's fun to argue with initially, but considering most people won't easily bend to fair logic, it can end up feeling just as hopeless as trying to argue against religion with a deeply fundamentalist Christian.
I definitely wasn't, but I was the example I gave. My parents taught me religion instead of logic. I had no comprehension of what mental control techniques would be, or even *why* I should value them. I was still a thoughtful person, and I would've actually understood my choices if I had the options in front of me with the proper information to explain each of them. \n\nThat's how the human mind works, actually. When we understand the results of something, we can healthily decide which choices we'd rather make. People in this thread seem to think it would be best to pretend 12 year olds are little precious Pokémon-playing babies, forgetting the fact that I would've been masturbating on Christmas and wondering why I felt guiltier about that than my normal masturbation. Or the fact that I'd be laying in bed and fantasizing about having a secret room dug under my house where I could capture the girl I liked from school and cage and rape her.\n\nThat's fucked up, right? *Really,* like, straight up psychopath fucked up, right? Then why did the first couple of girls I dated also happen to eventually admit they had fantasies of being raped when they were younger? Absolutely average girls. You'd think they were the more proper "smart" or "good" girls in a classroom, yet they were fantasizing about some older man violating them.\n\nYoung adults aren't stupid. They aren't innocent. And in any case that they *are* stupid or innocent, it's because we, ourselves, are too fucking naive to have already given them the tools not to be. Stupidity is a fucking abomination that should be fought with vigor, and innocence is a corruption of that stupidity that people have become convinced is somehow a good thing, as we degrade young adults by continuing to keep them in that ignorance.
The real uplifting news is always in the comments.
Is there actual evidence of anything? My theory has been that Trump doesn't want to be President and they'd be finding ways to remove him without actually hurting him much, and that would require some massive media machine effort to happen, say, before he can start building any walls or whatever. That will put the Kochs in charge through Pence. I don't know what's going on, but this massive media backlash seems exactly as orchestrated as what I'd expected would be occurring before long.
I'm pretty sure the Nazis make Jews illegal. Shall we debate the criminality of that, or do you realize you didn't actually make a valid point?
I would that I could.
If I was this person's teacher, they'd get a -1+1 on that one.
If I consider myself drastically smarter than most of the population, speaking for a friend, of course, does that mean I should feel like a pedophile no matter what?
So do you think this is because blacks are inherently less adaptive than whites, or do you think it's still something environmental? You seem to be implying the former blatantly racist perspective.
> Fortunately, you don't get to define Capitalism\n\nTechnically, anyone gets to define anything. Just like capitalism, memes survive based on arbitrary bullshit. If I believed your shitty fascist attempt to ignore my views, you'd win, but thankfully, I'm not a complete idiot. Capitalism *factually fucking does* exist as a system that empowers greed. It's a social system that defends "consent" in the favor of capitalist dictators. Their inherent power gets turned into some illusion of merit and virtue, as if massively taxing people is somehow moral when it's "consensual." You know, because the fact that employers royally fuck peasants on the reg is pretty much another definition people like to *randomly fucking create* to describe taxation, you know, [ignoring the reality of things.](http://i.imgur.com/2bVOTpg.jpg)
You completely missed my point. That's the very first thing I said:\n\n>My theory has been that Trump doesn't want to be President and they'd be finding ways to remove him without actually hurting him much
Hm, well, all this speculation makes me wonder what might really happen. Perhaps we should send them an Oculus to experiment so we can see the truth.
More importantly, they killed him as he was [pressing for a basic income and ensured-employment type of program](http://i.imgur.com/BlBRQVb.jpg) that actually had the support of 1200 economists.\n\nOf course money was at the root of it, and they ensured the only attempts to redistribute wealth were done in a way that enhances racism and still leaves people in squalor. 
Personally, I believe the establishment, along with Trump, have falsely created this whole narrative to get him out of office since he was likely only in place to ride in a win for the, establishment elite, Hillary. Their goal would now be to create some illusion of corruption worthy of removing him from office, then they'll flare up a wave of media showing liberals wanting Trump to be removed, then his removal will flare up the Right against Left *civilians* and allow Trump to get away with his Right-wing "build a wall" integrity because the Right will blame his removal on liberals.\n\nFinally, Pence, the Koch pawn, gets moved into the presidency, considering he was oddly thrown at Trump as his running mate, likely just to fill the presidency if/when Trump won. The establishment wins, people stay divided, and everyone is beautifully distracted as the media ramps up a bunch of stories about different acts of violence and whatnot. \n\nThis post could potentially change your view, but it wouldn't be in the standard black or white method you seem to be very clearly leading with your title for some reason.
My own.
If it was happening today, white people who would support it in their town with their openly spoken bullshit would simultaneously be saying they didn't do it until it was happening right in front of them, and even then, unless they pulled the rope, they'd probably be saying they didn't do it, even if they've got smiling photos of themself with their arm around the corpse. \n\nYet, somehow, people like my parents think *all* Muslims are taking over America. People see one "thug" and automatically apply that stereotype to every black person who remotely resembles that person.
Personally, I saw that same thread and completely assumed that sub is still being shilled. People got control of it, so I doubt they'd ever give that power up. CTR might be gone, but they'd find the next highest bidder to continue the propaganda. Having a bunch of people spam a thread early enough with some boosting is all it might take to push an ideology on the masses.
Pretty much positive that means 65% would *ever* hire an atheist over a religious person.
Yeah, but how does that make it sound like he's alive? Hitler is being recognized as a horrible person more and more recently.
You presume that white trash is self-aware.
That reminds me of Mega Man Soccer on SNES. I remembered that was always one of my more favorite rentals. Was so awesome having different shots for each type.
I miss when this sub wasn't filled with political establishment advertisements. *Propaganda is okay because "freedom!"*
Both the parties are corrupt and generally tag team us on everything, but they represent the same interests. I'm very glad either party could be destroyed. That's just one down.
Capitalism is another term for empowering greed, as I see it. When we treat greed like it's the most basic system society runs on, all the corrupt dealings and power accumulation caused by oligarchies is the natural follow-up. You'd have to be an *idiot* of a capitalist not to realize buying the government and laws was the most efficient use of your money.
A resignation letter is an implication without any evidence. That's exactly the type of thing I'd use to fuel a fake story if I wanted out of the presidency.\n\n*Edit:* Anything presented from within the establishment as "evidence," particularly when the media eats it up, like they did so suddenly from the start of the evidence-lacking "Russian hacking" claim, it should be strongly considered whether or not it's another false flag tactic as was used with "WMDs" that pulled us into a false war that resulted in many innocent deaths, both civilian and military. The oligarchy controlling the American government is a parasite that doesn't care about American lives. Everything they do should be severely questioned, *particularly* whatever they claim is their internal "evidence." The media is another arm of theirs, as well.
As a very conspiracy-focused person, of late, I've found an eerie similarity between the absurdly confused conspiracy theorists, and the actual way media functions to promote things that lack any real evidence.\n\nA conspiracy theorist hears about something bad, they hear another source that reinforces their view, they see something strange that also reinforces their view, and before you know it, the person is unhinged and falling down the rabbit hole of belief in that conspiracy that essentially lacks any verifiable evidence, as far as they're involved.\n\nLikewise, things like this Russia nonsense being thrown around so constant, or like "terrorism" and "WMDs" in the recent past that pulled us into absurd wars, all of it lacks any real evidence. Didn't Obama finally have Osama bin Laden killed, but there was no actual evidence, no photos, and they "threw his body in the Ocean" or something? If they achieved something so important, why wouldn't they create concrete evidence? This Russia thing is functioning the same way. They pick up unverified detail, blast it over airwaves and across the internet, find some other little snippet and blast it out, eventually find some little gold nugget that seems to put a nail in the coffin, but really, it's all based on unverified nonsense. No *actual* proof aside from claims and statements from a single organized entity, that's quite plainly acting in its own interests. \n\nWhen it gets down to it, the conspiracy theorist and the person consuming information without questioning the blatant conspiratorial entities pushing it out, they're really quite similar in their unscientific consumption of information. 
Who said democracy was threatened? The oligarchy?

My first thought was State of Decay. I got my starter character near the end of the first church base location, and ended up out near a corn field at night when a feral found me. It just started tearing me up, then I died and expected a respawn when it threw me to my other character. It was so intense realizing he was actually gone for good.\n\nOtherwise:\n\n**Rimworld**, I must repeat. Just get it.\n\nI also have to mention Mount & Blade. It's not a game where *everyone* can die, but all your non-unique units definitely can, and it gives me a similar feeling most of the time. It's also got so many other factors going for it, on top of badass mods like PoP, it's absolutely worth it. If you haven't played it, think of how XCOM functions with the world map gameplay, air battles, base construction, research, and tactical ground stuff. I categorize M&B and XCOM as "Battle Strategy" games.\n\nOther than that... Not so sure. I only played Survivalist for a few hours when I got it, but that's a really cheap version of a survival group type of game that's actually pretty damn well-put-together.
Hey, propaganda isn't that bad after all. It *did* only lead to the rise of Hitler and the laughing stock of the world that is Trump.
> Well, you're opinion on this matter is wrong.\n\nI didn't read what my last comment was, and I stopped reading on your response right here, because I needed to grab this [old Facebook comment of mine to explain how I'm feeling.](http://i.imgur.com/DkgeE6Q.png)\n\nAnyway, let's see...\n\n>Teenagers are stupid whether they are being treated like adults or not.\n\nSo how do you calculate intelligence? What if some person is smarter than everyone else? If a person is born as a genius, should it be illegal for them to have sex because everyone would be as smart as children to them?\n\n>So much happens with your brain from 13-18 it's not even funny.\n\nI don't think that's funny either way.\n\n>As a horribly horny 14 year old,\n\n[Go on...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8c5wmeOL9o)\n\n>I'm happy as hell adults weren't allowed to take advantage of me.\n\nOh... Well, maybe you had shitty parents who didn't love you enough to teach you the basic pressures and choices required to be a functional human.\n\n>What a fucking train wreck that would have been.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion you're projecting a trainwreck onto what "would have been" of your youth, because you could easily describe other parts of your life as a trainwreck, anyway, because either situation is probably stemming from similar neglect you experienced as a child or young adult.\n\nI apologize for saying you have shitty parents, because I'm a failure as a human in plenty of my own ways, but since I don't know you whatsoever and I'll never talk to you again after this, I just wonder if I'm right about that. I feel like you're projecting your failings in life onto your childhood. \n\nI imagine people I know saying what you said, and the ones I imagine doing that were the types who got into weed and sex in middle-school, harder drugs and riskier sex in high school, then had kids at some point, possibly younger than they should have, and suddenly turned into what they consider "an adult," at which point they decided to distance themselves from the "stupid" teenage years, when really, the only thing that made them a sudden adult was the respect they finally felt by having a kid. \n\nInstead of all that garbage, they could've maybe needed some respect by their parents or other adults in their youth before they got dragged through all that bullshit.
And then the worker angrily supports a law to ban cookies from food stamps because the banker put out an ad saying the immigrant used food stamps to get a crumb. The disabled reactionary nods in agreement about his own sinful cookie consumption(things that hypocritical reactionaries wouldn't do for $500.) 
How so? I thought he was perfectly sensible. I say this as a liberal moving toward communist.
Nah, no proof. This is just getting used as the excuse to pull him out of office. He doesn't want to be president, and he never actually planned on it. He was *with her.*
Send me nudes.
> Getting Hillary elected would have garnered at least some significant movement when she inevitably drifted towards moderate establishment politics, especially given Bernie's elevation in the party.\n\nAnd none of it would matter because we'd still be under the same regime. They'd just have PR with a different hue. We need a full revolution. I thought Trump had a better chance of bringing that about as he continues forth and actually acts on his decisions, but instead, the media is churning up this Russia story to replace him with apathy and Pence. The media has pretty much *never* sided with any sort of real social movement, yet they're spamming Trump bullshit because people are eating it up. Amazing how well they can ignore tens of thousands of people gathering to support Sanders, then go on to highlight every little peasant who has a problem with Trump.
Yeah, I'm glad, too. This thread just wouldn't feel right without this comment about suicide being 6th from the top.
Probably because schools didn't want to deal with soccer moms yelling about the horrible things being taught to their child.
> an executive administration that makes multiple verifiably false statements to try and protect not just its policies, but even it's image, every single day, is completely honest in your opinion.\n\nWho the fuck said anything about them being honest? I don't care whether they're honest. The enemy of my enemy is just another fucking enemy. Fuck the media, the establishment, and anything they try to gain my support over, even when it's against a laughable president.\n\nI thought voting for Trump would show us all the flaws of the establishment enough that we'd unite. I guess I drastically underestimate the naivety of average people. We see the Democrat establishment rig the election against the only real candidate, then instead of people caring about it, the establishment hand-waves the blame over to a third party and everyone starts sucking their dicks again.
100% possible, and very highly likely. Looks like he's casually staring forward as any old guy might do, then he feels the guy push something into his head, swats at him, then at the last second, we get a glimpse of the moment where he sees the gun and starts to realize what it was. I'm sure he flipped out off camera pretty quickly.
Ah, I get it now. Was about to say there'd be absolutely no reason for CNN to put this shit into our focus unless they wanted to push some establishment candidate, but this would just be the focus-group beta-testing period.
Hence the need for a technological communist renaissance. Programs and AI aren't beholden to emotions or greed.
It is when I get into metaphors.
Consider the difference being a person's integrity in working for us. If a person is genuinely planning to work for us, as Sanders has done all his life, it's a better alternative than a corrupt government massively exploiting us. Properly directed taxation is obviously widely accepted in the healthiest countries of the world. \n\nBut If we can't trust any politicians running, while Ron Paul seems genuine, maybe dismantling all the exploitative establishment bullshit would be a good thing. Let capitalism have a phoenix moment to start off people on more even ground.
Actually, the term is entirely logical. The way the guy used it was the ridiculous part. A fetus is essentially a parasite to the host, although it's one of our own species, so we discriminate against the term because we overvalue ourselves. The silly part is more so our hubris leading toward that basic disregard for reality. It should not be offensive in any way, ignoring this case where this idiot adds on his horrible misinterpretation.
Ah, the ol' Gulf of Tonkin approach.
Or how some dating site showed men of pretty much all ages seem to have their main attraction as females who are 18. It went up by a total of like 5 years as a gradient as the men reached probably 60.
Why do anything? Because we have the goal of sexual stimulation.
Sorry, I forgot facts are made-up as we go along, now.
Yeah, but no one made that statement, dickhat.
So you're saying it's the oligarchy and their propaganda arm? Why should we give them the benefit of the doubt? If all they have to do is yell about Russia to get our support, they could commandeer any election that doesn't go as they'd like and they wouldn't even need to hack it themselves.
Someone I admired introduced me to the site, so I decided to make an account just to have one as early as possible. I started getting on more a year after that point.
I had sex at 16 and would've *gladly* had sex earlier. I think I could've used to sex motivation to stop me from living in my head about it for so long.
Pretty much say anything that isn't PC for the hate community.
It's okay. From his post history, he vapes. He can be trusted.
A fetus is a third-party coming into existence through a host who didn't necessarily consent to the entire process of pregnancy, birth, and knowing their genes were forced into life on the planet in a potentially negligent situation.\n\nIf two people consent to sex, that has nothing to do with another person being able to jump in and invade a woman's body. 
How is this worse than the DNC undermining our democratic process that ended up with us here in the first place? Trump was their "pied piper" or did you forget that part?
Aw sweet. Now I can get the joys of feeling like a pedophile without actually having to be one.

How could you shamelessly advertise for one of the media groups that blatantly pumped out timed hate articles against Sanders when it was to their advantage? They're the ones who got us Trump in the first place.
I'm sure she takes herself out every night. To the finest restaurants in America, drinking the most expensive wines, and hopefully affording herself a driver at this point. All thanks to the glories of capitalism. You, too, could someday be powerful enough to kill people and not go to jail. Just make sure you're made from the sperm or egg of a Walton. I'm still hoping that'll be me someday.
Actually, the comment was:\n\n> Showing up in numbers\n\n...\n\nAh! I get it. My username. Cuz *one is the loneliest number*.
Still doesn't compare to the time the US government helped Saudis kill 3000 people by destroying the World Trade Centers and damaging the Pentagon because they wanted to hide the trillions of dollars they stole from Americans and likely shared with those same Saudis. Parasites. Who gives a fuck if Russia takes over our government? It's not like we've got any control over the oligarchy either way.
What's so wrong with the handlebar stache? Is it somehow too pretentious for a male to do anything with his appearance that requires time and investment? If so, no wonder females are so subjugated. They try way too hard to objectify themselves.
Great, now I've gotta cite your comment in arguments.
Trump doesn't want to be president and this is how they're getting him out. Before they're forced to waste money on a stupid wall, thus retaining Trump's integrity toward the people who actually wanted a wall. Then they can just blame liberals, who will be very will highlighted by the media, as well. People will forget it was Congress and stay as divided as they were from the start. Except now, they'd have a Koch pawn in place in the White House to do all the corrupt shit Hillary was planning to do.
That's true, and then we'll need to have a revolution to fix the AI and programs. This shit doesn't just stop suddenly because the rich won for eternity.
Weeks? Where have you been for the last year and a half?
What is this? A stereotype battle? 
Found the establishment supporter.
Trump has his ego, but aside from completely marring him with all his supporters, his resignation would very plainly imply he was actually working with Hillary. He was the DNC's "pied piper," but I believe that was coordinated on his side, too.
That's true, too. All the more reason to realize how difficult it would be to program a government without the loopholes we allow for power to unhealthily accumulate. 
Yeah, I'd do a lot of stupid shit now at 29, but there isn't a law against every one of them yet. And most of this stupid shit I'd do is definitely because I'd be horny.
Yeah, I'm expecting Pence to get put in for Trump. Trump never actually intended to be president, and now they're finding a way to kick him out with *just* enough evidence that they can't put him in prison over it. Then we'll end up with a Koch plant instead of a "Russian" one, and everyone will be pacified in this extremist Right-wing corporate oligarchy we've gotten ourselves into.
Probably for the same reason many of us voted for both Ron Paul and Sanders.
Things like the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc., are ultimately working against Americans at this point. If they were part of what gets defunded, I'd gladly vote for who made it happen. We will never have a functioning government that acts in our interest as long as those establishments can assassinate or undermine any leader who starts to bring us together.

Thanks for reminding me I'm missing those fries in the freezer from my life.
Dude it's literally the first rule of the sub, in the sidebar.
Haha you reposted it, nice, told you it was good :)
Arguments like yours confuse me. I imagine you as someone who somehow just dismantled yourself and turned into some new person at some point. Like, "That wasn't me, back then! That was a mere child with no desires or thoughts or intelligence! I had no grasp on reality. It was like I was living in a hallucination! My parents taught me religion, so I still believed in fairy tales and couldn't grasp logic!" \n\nWas everyone really that retarded as a kid? I gained knowledge over time, but it was specifically because I lived experiences that allowed me to gain that knowledge. If I consented to be with an older person sexually, that should've been my right, just as much as it would've been my right to masturbate or legally have sex with some other "idiot" peer. \n\nI'm still the same person I was at 12 or 13 or 14. I'm 29 now. I actually trust myself enough to say I would've trusted myself to make the right decisions back then, too. And if I made a bad decision, I'd learn from it. That's the beauty of life. Particularly when I disregard the cultural attitude that sexuality is tied to a person's worth to the point that it "destroys their innocence" or "uses up their value." That's the underlying tone I get from a lot of opinions like yours, and that's far more objectifying and disgusting, in my opinion.
Could've picked something with better visuals than what looks like it's from 1996 Beast Wars period.
Well, the age of consent is a law. Discussing the moral necessities for such a law is just as valid as anything. Definitely *more* valid than many things, considering people tend to treat sexuality as if one party is being destroyed or "used up" in the process. I would say my pro-female empowerment side supports ending the idea that sexuality is destructive or damaging for a person.
Yeah, I'm gonna go out on a sturdy limb and say this is going into the current media narrative. Apparently they're taking a break from attacking Russia to go for Sweden. Russia is the primary goal, though.
They're really advertising a lot over this too.

Say what you will about Wikileaks but they're information is usually accurate and legit. It's the wild conclusions that people draw from the leaks that are the fake news.

the key difference here being the Maher has an entertainment/comedy talk show, while O'Reilly is on the country's most popular news network. O'Reilly should be held to a significantly higher standard than Maher 
By what definition of "leftist" would you consider laissez faire capitalism to be on the left? Most people would call it an extreme-right position, economically. What's on the right for you then?

Just a distinction, civil liberties usually refers to governments' self-limitations on power, e.g. through a constitution or some other legal documents. Libertarians in general may or may not support civil liberties, with minarchists, classical liberals, and constitutional conservatives probably falling closer to the "support" category. However from my experience both libertarian socialists and more hardline right-libertarians tend to eschew the concept of civil liberties as just another way for the government to legitimize the action they take. Take in constitutional law for example, the abstract idea was for the Supreme Court to be able to reign in overreaches in government power by declaring action as "unconstitutional". However the practical effect of the court has been instead to provide approval and legitimacy by declaring certain actions as "constitutional", more of the inverse of the intended effect rather than its complement.\n\nGood right-libertarian text which touches on this called "Anatomy of the State". It's short and there are audio book versions freely available. As far as left libertarians, no specific text I can point to, since left libertarians tend to be a bit more hardcore anarchist than their right counterparts, and don't even entertain the farcical idea of a government that respects its own restraints.
The last 10 years? Try at least 25. It's been in bad shape since I can remember.
I'd caution against saying that modern fascists are necessarily nationalists. Nationalism as we understand it most clearly is a specter of the early 20th century. This kind of nationalism and its contemporary fascism were very tightly linked, one might argue inseparable. However both nationalism and as a social institution and fascism as a political philosophy have evolved a great deal since then. I've even seen fascists argue against state directed capital accumulation. Nowadays I don't think it's even particularly useful or informative to use the word "fascist" except in historical context. It's more interesting to discuss the issues of importance to any particular sub group, and explain how for one reason or another they go against anarchist principles. For the record I tend to sniff out neo fascists based on their organizational tactics, appeals to some subset of conservative social values, and a tendency to mask their true motives in rhetoric about symptoms of reformist liberal policy. 
Not a democrat or a republican here, just wanted to offer you a historical perspective. In general, the net effect of immigrant workers legislation of democrats and republicans over time has been to drive down wages and bargaining power of workers. They do this by leniency on undocumented workers, leniency on their employers, and still having a technically strict legal framework that can be flexed at times as a token political reaction to ensure the locals that they're still "tough" on immigration. Strict policy and law drives wages down, while practical leniency allows black market pathways to these low wage jobs. The net effect, which has been a historical trend for hundreds of years (so there's no doubt it's well understood in DC), is a collusion across party lines to drive down migrant worker wages without practically preventing them from working here, they just work as second-class residents who cannot engage in civil society. If you want to see the truest tyranny and dogma in our political system, you should look at the long term trends that are questioned by neither faction.
Actually I haven't noticed it before. I'm not saying it's not nice stuff, I just thought it was against the rules of the sub. My mistake, whatever dude 
She also said in a Vanity Fair interview her life motto is "fuck that shit"
Wouldn't that be a 96?
I'm not implying that a revolution doesn't require violence. But I'd question whether you're letting your emotions and deep set hatred of capitalism get in the way of conducting a rational threat analysis. Have you systematically laid out and analyzed the possibilities of counter revolution and estimated their conditional probabilities given different situations? The capitalists are doing this, on a rolling basis I might add, more frequently than every day. I'm not even going to go into all of the nuances of revolutionary strategy, but "the bourgeoisie aren't going to give up their property without a fight, we should kill them" doesn't qualify as a strategy. It's an emotional counter-reaction. And it very well might be a waste of resources, or even counter productive, until you have some analysis to serve as grounds for your strategy.
You don't have the balls to put any thought into your posts, maybe if you took a bit more time to think about things before running your mouth, you wouldn't feel so confused and out of your element.
First of all, I would commend you for your self awareness. It's not easy to criticize your own lifestyle, and it's an important part of understanding your place in the current social order.\n\nI thought about this a lot when I was at university. My family was super low income so my tuition and living expenses were paid for by the government. As you can imagine an anarchist could have some moral qualms about that. I also considered that it was only because of my position of privilege in American society that I had the opportunity to live a relatively opulent college student life.\n\nUltimately I rationalized it by saying that my purity of self is not as important as what I contribute to the movement. An opportunity for an American college education is something many people abroad would kill for, and probably still never have. If I can take that education and use it to further leftist goals, it makes more of an impact than if I just tried to be puritanical about not accepting privileges. In the latter situation I would just be relegating my influence to a position of least privilege, which to someone who starts without that privilege could seem much more selfish.\n\nSo yeah it could feel awkward. I've found that the best way to cope with those situations is to always be ready to advance your long term leftist goals. Have some downtime in first class? Work on writing your manifesto or studying organizational tactics. Not to say you should be looking to book first class all the time, of course it can be good to live frugally. Keep your awareness about privilege, but use it for cynicism instead of feeling guilty all the time. Puritanical belief systems are made fun of for a reason: they're fucking stressful and suck to adhere to.
That's what I assumed but I was really just hoping OP had a better explanation. Always happy to be proven wrong and learn something new ya know? It's a long shot but I like to reply to heavily downvoted posts that seem to be expressing an earnest disagreement, in the hope that I'll gain some alternative perspective 
Except that there's no assertion in Marx that price (pay) is equal to value. In fact the labor theory of value explicitly mentions that these quantities are only indirectly related. Especially on an individual transaction basis. You made the implication that these were equivalent in your first post, which is why I questioned if you've actually read Capital.\n\nAnd how did this turn into us vs. them? I'm libertarian, and in my experience many people, libertarians and socialists alike, have a shallow and incorrect understanding of how he formulated his abstraction of the economy. 
Nice except you got the names backwards.
This needs to be upvoted more. OP has been posting troll as fuck shit all over all day. Can we actually just get a ban for this shitstain?

It's not an argument. I'm just calling you a dweeb. If you want an argument, horseshoe theory is only believed by those who take narrow and uncommon definitions of political theories and use it to equate philosophies that are ideologically opposed, without considering the details. This is symptomatic of right libertarian narrow mindedness, whose practitioners think that arguments based on inflexible definitions are clever. Actually they're dweebs and everyone else can see they're just subscribers to rigid dogma. It's symptomatic of not just right libertarian beliefs, but every rigid political dogma, including the extreme communists who basically do the same thing in reverse with the definition of capitalism. Then when they argue the debate inevitably devolves into both sides clinging to their rigid definitional dogma, with no actual discussion taking place. Dweebs all.

Cool, I'm not really into celebrities so I was unaware. I'm usually pretty local focused. I do agree it's pretty nuts stuff. Thanks for explaining it to me instead of popping your lid off like everyone else seems to have done.
\nNo, in capitalism your leverage to acquire the outcome of your labor is based on your ownership of the capital used to produce it. Ownership in capitalism is based on property rights, which are strongly dependent on state violence to enforce. In capitalism you cannot print money or issue credit, and you cannot make use of property that you do not own.\n\nIn anarchism there is no property, so you are not prevented from working with the means of production because they are not your "property". By removing the imbalance of bargaining power and barriers to entry for a labor position, the workers are capable of collecting full remuneration for their labor.
whatever, didn't say it wasn't cool. just off-topic
He's not saying it's a single determining factor. He's just saying it explains a lot of regional differences within Europe. Of course there are always exceptions to social trends but for the most part it correlates with the data 
You've addressed my first sentence, but not any of the rest of the content of my post. Hallmark of a troll. I won't engage in a conversation with someone who selectively harps on the weakest facets of an argument rather than its main point.
Reading comprehension tip #1: if you don't see the point of a phrase on its own, scan the surrounding material for context. In this case I wanted to state that although I am an atheist, it is not because I think religious people are inherently stupid, but rather because I don't have a place in my own worldview for engaging with philosophy predicated on falsehoods. But everyone has a different context for their behavior, and may find religion useful or pragmatic depending on their circumstances.

What about the ban on murder? Should that be revoked since imperialists also ban murder?

First of all, most political scientists agree that one or two dimensional political scales are generally misleading. So to say "it's basic" anything you're probably most accurate to say "it's basically misleading".\n\nAnyway you have to have your head pretty far up your ass to think that the Nazis were left wing. Or to somehow equate how they structured their economy with a nominally communist nation. But please, if I'm the one with my head up my ass, explain this to me.
Yeah so do I. Wait was that sarcasm?
Please get Jefferson's schlong out of your throat. None of the founding fatcats were interested in fighting on the front lines. They were the liberal elites of their era, the only fighting they were interested in was fighting in a parliament to protect their dubious property rights (slaveholding, enclosure of already occupied native lands, etc).
That's the thing about prevention. You don't need to penalize someone for an action that they never take due to its prevention. Mind blowing right?

If you're going PhD then it's all about the research. Which means you'll be working on whatever your research advisor has funding to study. Which means in turn that you should investigate particular researchers or research laboratories which you plan on applying to. Read their papers, read whatever is in their papers' bibliography, and in your application you should make it crystal clear that you've done your reading and you're interested/passionate about their line of study. Bonus points if you can identify future lines of research from their papers.\nIf you can do this stuff then you will put yourself ahead of the pack.
As an atheist, there is a difference between "factually incorrect" and "stupid". Religion may very well be a smart choice for some people, even though it is not based in logic. The platform for religion has had millennia to evolve into an institution that is intertwined in important ways with our human needs. As an anarchist, I look at it like government. It's wrong, it needs to be eradicated in favor of modern alternatives, but it's not "stupid" for people to espouse it in the current social context.\n\nI'll tell you what's stupid is to lack empathy when trying to affect social change.
Democratic =/= voting 
I don't agree with his manner of discourse, but I do think he has a good point about not associating antifa with liberalism. Antifa is mostly made up of hardline communists and anarchists. It's basically like associating Trump support and the alt right with libertarianism. There's little connection besides a few shared goals, which you could easily find in any two compared movements.
If someone hacks the data then they haven't been prevented from obtaining it, which goes against our earlier premises doesn't it?\n\nI feel like you're grasping at straws here by trying to make the problem seem unsolvable by enumerating every corner case. But it just makes your case seem really flimsy since it's obvious your main focus is a moot point that needs to be bolstered with distraction. Hacking is totally orthogonal to the issue of whether the system makes the information publicly available, which is the status quo. Not many people think limiting government will fix all social problems, but the trick is to evaluate whether it's better than the status quo.
The mistake you're making here is to call it "the" goal rather than "a goal". Anarchists don't generally believe that ALL hierarchy originates in the mode of production or economic system, or even a state for that matter. Although the liberal capitalist state is the strongest institution of hierarchy today, it is but one of many hurdles to a more anarchist society. Individual goals are important, but since social forms change, we need to be flexible enough to combat hierarchy when it arises in changed form, after we stomp it out somewhere else 
Why? Capitalism doesn't hold any allegiance to the particular group of people who temporarily occupy its upper echelons. Bourgeoisie are an artifact of the economic system, not some group of inherently nefarious people without whom capitalism would evaporate. You could kill all the bourgeois assholes you want and if the workers didn't take control over the means of production, a new bourgeoisie would appear organically, even if everyone intended wholeheartedly to be socialists. Don't kill the bourgeoisie, expropriate their property to those who work it.
> left wing\n\n> more government involvement \n\nDude wut 
Not exactly. Have you even read Capital? Marx speaks in terms of averages. So the average socially necessary labor determines value, and hence expected average pay. If someone creates an invention, the average necessary labor goes down, and also does the value.
That was fucking hilarious mate.
I don't think OP intended it as a pun tbh, I was just guessing what the other one was talking about.
The reason we have representatives is because the people can't be expected to understand the details of all legislative issues. Nothing's changed about that. Representatives serve, theoretically, as our expert proxies for complicated legislative decisions. Note that I don't agree that our current solution is effective, just pointing out its theoretical justification.
Wut. You sound like a liberal spouting off about how all Trump supporters are racist sexist bigots who want to bring back fascism. You might wanna pull your head out of your ass if you intend to actually attempt to understand the world.
Actually around here "liberal" refers more or less to anyone who's not a fascist or socialist. It's the trinity of political groups that characterized the early 20th century. Since a lot of anarchist literature and lingo originated in this period, it tends to be the default reference era for definitions are perceived not to change much.
He's putting forth a reactionary opinion. Party elites influence drops and Trump gets elected? The solution should be to restore party elites influence! I can't think of a more reactionary response. Textbook. He literally said \n\n"We need to give party elites a greater say in the process; not because they will select truly great candidates, but to reduce the danger of ending up with horrendously awful ones. Despite their many flaws, party elites have strong incentives to choose candidates who can appeal to a broad swathe of general election voters, and who are not likely to be dangerously incompetent or unhinged."\n\n
Any black market transaction qualifies here. Could be a drug or other contraband sale, you can't call the cops if someone steals all your heroin. That's why it's important to have a small number of contacts, all with good reputations, in the drug business. But it doesn't need to be contraband, you could be selling kazoos, and if you're not paying taxes, it's black market and you risk tax fraud charges if you go to the cops. I'm embellishing here obviously, just to illustrate the gist.\n\nIf you're interested in this topic in particular, there's an interesting philosophy called "Agorism" that is completely about subverting and delegitimizing hierarchy using black markets. It's actually an outgrowth of the American libertarian movement, but it was so far left that it didn't really take off in the far-right "Libertarian Party" so it's kinda been relegated to the fringes of both left and right libertarianism without being a moderate or centrist philosophy. Anyway it goes into some detail about the concepts and theoretical frameworks of black markets, and although I'm not an agorist per se, I do highly recommend reading some of the stuff to have those very elusive notions a bit clearer in your head.

As someone who has studied both anarchism and Marxism, I'm curious as to your logic here. Please don't take my question as petulant, I'm genuinely looking to understand your perspective. What part of Marxism would you consider "scientific"? And in what way does anarchism "reject" this scientific aspect of Marxism? I'm pretty open minded about this topic so please help me learn.
> No wonder libertarians keep losing.\n\nFail troll. I don't even identify as a libertarian, I only have mild and contextual libertarian sentiments.\n\n> And you're still terrified to answer my question \n\nYou asked a really silly question. I tried to explain why people around here wouldn't take your points seriously, but if you'd rather I answer directly here's my closest estimate:\n\nA libertarian society would probably not have "intellectual property" as it stands now, since there's a strong case to be made that intellectual property rights are unenforceable without a government, at least as they work today. Since intellectual property doesn't exist, data cannot be owned, so most forms of hacking and computer crime would be also unenforceable and thus not a crime. So the data "theft" is not a crime, the hacking itself is not a crime, and the responsibility falls on the holder of the data to keep it safe- rather than requesting potential thieves to not hack, as an excuse for industry and government to exercise laughable security standards as is the case today.\n\nThe main difference being that instead of trying to make artificial and violent disincentives to hacking, the data holder is expected to protect it at their own will according to the value of the data.

    Nerd: command not found
I understand where you're coming from and I agree that organized religion has more problems than simple religious practice. Theoretically. However in messy reality it's really hard to tease these two things apart, since practice is generally developed in parallel with, if not as an integral part of, the institutions themselves. For that reason I think there's still a lot of the positive aspect of religion embedded in the institutions and organizational practices, and I wouldn't want to discount organized religion from study until we can confidently say we've factored out these aspects into other places such as practice, or secular institutions, or something.
It's not a haystack, your analogy is terrible. It makes it sound like they're just dumping all their data onto tape without even indexing it or linking its metadata into an easily searchable system. You'd have to be pretty naive to think that the NSA would spend billions on data collection only to analyze it in real time. As someone who has worked a lot with big data and machine learning, I'd guess that 10% of their technical operating cost for bulk data collection is spent on researching new indexing algorithms and maintaining systems for indexing. If not significantly more, since it's a volume of data far larger than anything I've ever worked with.
I was skeptical about this too but it's pretty much true. Best way to verify it, next time you see a story about "zany Kim antics and hilarious despot", wait until the story is like 2-3 days old. Then look in the comments or do a search for it under "nk fake news" or something. When I started doing this I realized it's actually not just NK news but most popular news is exaggerated, sensational, and outright misleading. But especially for NK, I've found like 9 times out of 10 there's will be a credible rebuttal within a couple of days. It's egregious lies most of the time too, stuff like "new satellite photos provide evidence that Kim murders kittens with machetes" but the photos they provide are not new, just copy pasted from an unrelated article from like 4 years ago.
It's all g dude I wasn't coming down on you for it, just bringing it to your attention.
Did you just pull those years out of your ass or is there a reason you chose 1999 and 2013?
Since we all seem to be on the same page about "bash the fash" I'd like to remind everyone that this is 2017 USA, not 1932 Germany. The characteristics of every fascist movement are different and we should strategically make use of these differences in our resistance. In reality there are many subcultures that contribute to fascist ideology in the USA, and very few of them bear close resemblance to Nazism directly. Only aggregated do they form the familiar picture we recognize from the dawn of the Third Reich.\n \nThis is not a devils advocate sentiment, just a reminder that lumping all of our ideological enemies into one black box based on a nearly 100 year old historical precedent does a disservice to our comprehension of details and resistance strategy.
Ancap society in a nutshell 
It sounds like you rejected in a naive and warped version of leftist ideology, close to standard western liberalism with a hint of social democracy. In that case I'm not surprised. I wasn't saying that I understand the world, but just that losing all but a disingenuous and cynical sympathy for a position is a quick way to not understand it.\n\nThe video you linked is a ridiculous strawman. He goes around and interviews reasonably comfortable and affluent black people living in a super urban area. These are not the types of people voter ID laws disenfranchise. Try interviewing the bottom rung impoverished poor, especially those in underdeveloped or rural areas.\n\nThere are lots of flavors of the far left, but for example they tend to agree that workers are not given their fair share of their labor output. One far leftist group, market socialists, say that this "unfair share" is enforced by government limiting people's economic opportunities- for example there are significant legal barriers to issuing currency or credit, starting a bank, or opening a factory. This creates an imbalance of negotiating power that favors employers unnaturally over employees, which of course drives wages and benefits artificially low. Leftists closer to communism believe that, contrary to market socialism, labor inequality is created by the wage labor economic system itself, having been initially seeded into imbalance by the remnants of feudal aristocracy around the time of the enlightenment. For communists change must begin in the productive enterprises themselves, meaning that the workers should self-manage, and this will naturally grow new systems of social organization which deprecate liberal democratic institutions.\n\nThis has basically been the far left for over a hundred years. So I'm not sure what you mean when you say "the political spectrum is becoming more extreme" but then call out left liberal idealists as your extremists.
I read your comments and I agree with you. Just wanted to express that.
Just because something has good qualities, doesn't mean you can't do better.
Careful conflating your observations of "cultural Marxism" with Marxist ideology. The latter is a theory of economic and historical analysis, which has nothing to say about things like social norms besides that they are shaped by the dominant model of production in each society.
Do you think anyone is fooled by your incredibly weak strawman argument?
Actually I remember that being something I noticed a lot as a kid. But over time as I saw the map again and again, I think my mind became numb to it. Seeing the map from a different perspective, that significant detail stands out again.

Ben'sghayzi?
Pickup a textbook? I studied political science and worked for a US Senator doing legislative research in Washington DC. Pretty sure I know what I'm talking about. You on the other hand, based on your over-simplified and under-nuanced descriptions of everything, seem pretty clueless.\n\nAnd "semantics" literally means "the meaning". Since this is an argument about the meaning of left vs. right wing, semantics are relevant. Left wing does not equate to big government. There's not even a correlation there.\n\nExtreme right-wing despots such as Nazi Germany, South Korea until almost 1990, Pinochet's Chile, Franco's Spain, etc, have been generally characterized as governments having "complete control over everything." Are you saying any of these governments were far left?
I don't understand your jargon.
What exactly is your problem with that formulation? I could point out some common misconceptions but I'd rather not guess at your understanding.
Audiobook available also. It's not gratis but it's not hard to find pirated. However it's a Great book, I highly recommend paying for it.
Is that what a false flag is?
A community of workers is perfectly capable of judging that one person isn't doing shit, and refusing to give them charity. There's nothing against anarchism about refusing to baby an adult. What's with this simple minded straw man of an anticapitalist you paint? If an anarchist can't keep a handle on the outcome of his labor, there's nothing that will help him overcome capitalism in the first place.
The point is that you are offering an inaccurate portrayal of the history and root causes of fascism. The point is that fascism itself is only at most as old as modern liberalism, capitalism, and revolutionary socialism. You're enabling complacency in liberalism by pretending that fascism is a natural outgrowth of any other system besides liberalism, besides being historically inaccurate.
Neoliberal left? Dude wat? You realize neoliberal basically refers to modern free laissez faire or free market advocates?

It's not opinion. It's fact.  As people age the vast majority lose cognitive function, physical ability, and ability to adapt.  That is why we have a requirement age.

i thought u meant the people who think allowing businesses to profit off of it instead of just letting everyone grow and have whatever they want.\n\nthere are some people that just want to decriminalize and have it not be taxed or regulated and be like no other product in existence.. these people will also fight tooth and nail any legislation that does not fit this ideology closely and have been against many of the legalization bills in many states because they were too controlled by government and large money interests.\n\nthey care about their own principals of economics than they do about their fellow mans freedoms..

how many other comments not to do with racial identity politics in the timeframe these were taken from? the ratio is relevant. i hope this isnt cherrypicking bullshit
i think its ridiculous. personally i think its bigotry and sexism. i think its perfectly fine for a young teenage boy to explore his sexuality with an adult. i wish it happened to me. i spent years being sexually repressed and being told and given the impression it was bad. americans are disgusting when it comes to this. they have sexually retarded their society. just because hes talking about young boys and homosexuality or of he talked about girls ...\n\nthere nothing wrong with a 13 or 14 year old boy having sex with an older woman at the very least. like i said.. i wish it happened to me so i didnt get traumatized by americas ridiculous sexual standards and practices\n\nedit: i hate milo i think hes a disgusting drama fiend and white supremacist.. but he has a point about a handful of things and this is one of them
i dont think bill disagreed with him there did he? neither do i... ive wanted to fuck adults since i was younger than a teenager and im angry society raises their children to think sex is more than something like breathing, eating and sleeping
NOW, he does... they are also suckin bernie off during interviews when before they were grilling him like he was fucking their teenage daughter

or because u can tilt ur head whenever u want and look over the glasses
> within the context of a wronged woman seeking vengeance, that's what her job was.\n\nthis is all i was contesting. her job was vengeance. not womens vengeance. thats just what SHE chose to do
as soon as anything on that level happens without you making false equivalencies ill agree with you
thats an excuse too. saying "it cant be done" is lazy writing and lazy is unacceptable for billion dollar companies.\n\nyou are making excuses that is exactly what you are doing\n\nwhy wouldnt it make sense?\n\ni can think of twelve things they did that make less sense than not having the other studio rights. oh and BTW they did those things specifically because they had to replace the REAL storylines with their own bullshit because they didnt have the rights to the proper characters

i wasnt impressed with the other 2 posts ive seen claiming the same thing and mentioning way more examples. so far everything ive read that bothered me was the reaction to the very tame mentions of identity politics on twitter. i have a hard time disagree with the idea that there should be more minorities in government office. that seems to be the main point of the tweets im seeing

i will never forgive sorkin for dangling this amazing feat of social science and journalism on tv in front of our faces and then just completely rape and kill the entire idea.\n\ni heard him claim it was because journalists told him hes making them look bad because ACN does their job better. do i have that right? im paraphrasing of course but thats the impression i got.
im going to make a call and say hes saving money because the metal is so special it needs super expensive paint and hes paying out the ass to fund avengers stuff and replace things he destroys as iron man.

i distinctly remember drax and thanos fighting at some point though. didnt have to stab him with those knives, coulda been something else. i dont remember though

who decides that though? who is anyone but arguably a parent to tell a teenager who they should fuck? why does the state get to imprison someone who is 30 that has sex with a 17 year old. or an 18 year old that has sex with a 14 year old? its insanity that people get their lives destroyed by this. sex is not a sacred experience and your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria, water and electrical signals..\n\nthe only trauma from childrens sexual appetites specifically, comes from influencing someone to develope their sexual and emotional maturity before their body is ready and the societal pressure we put on kids in every possible way to oppress their sexuality. its disgusting and WAY more disgusting than the idea of a 14 year old having a sexual relationship with someone who is an "adult" whatever the fuck that means.\n\nthe same generation of people who told us cannabis is a schedule one drug, lead doesnt cause harm to ones body or brain and cigarettes are good for you is placing teenagers sexual development in a box and retarding its growth and then using the symptoms of that to justify the existence of the laws after they are implemented. they do the same thing with the war on drugs and pretty much everything else... like terrorism and education as well

it doesnt matter how many they get... ill never be satisfied until theyre ALL there and by all, i dont mean every avenger there ever was.. i mean F4 and Xmen... but most importantly... silver surfer.. i want to see him go after thanos in a fit of rage after nebula gets the gauntlet and thanos is helping them get it from her.. omg.. the only way that would be better is on screen..

donald trump cant form a coherent sentence in response to a reporters question and he is in charge of nuclear codes. said codes are held in a briefcase that is at the mar a lago right now handcuffed to a SS agent. this upsets people.

no shit dude.\n\nall these characters have different roles in the story. they all stand up to thanos and fail, which establishes thanos's power.\n\nffs the avengers in the MCU form are like tinfoil compared to the real ensemble in the IG comics. the idea that thanos is going to establish his power to the viewers adequately by beating them is kind of silly to me.\n\ni have like twelve other reasons but i have a headache and im going to bed.
is that a real fucking question??

jeremy felt that him being there would give more credit to milo and bolster his supporters on a grander scale that will have more effect than anyone he would convince milo is a charlatan. im sorry i disagree.\n\ni wouldnt debate trump on anything either because he just spouts nonsense and i am lowering the validity of my argument just by taking his opinions seriously
the idea that epics have been made the same way for like thousands of years with the same themes should really quell most of the cynicism, but we are not an educated society. we arent taught that storytelling is basically always telling the same story and history always repeats itself in blatant form

Look how much bigger that truck is than the car. What if it was an 80,000 lb semi that didn't even brake? What's a safe distance, 100 feet, 100 yards, a quarter mile?\n\nDoes not make any sense.

See, that sounds more like it - an extended period of inactivity and notice was given well ahead of time.
None of this is true. It seems like you've never looked at a report from a real credit reporting agency.\n\nYou are either reported paid/paying as agreed or not. \n\nThe only reason to have activity on a card from a credit scoring perspective is to keep the account open, and I really think the possibility of having your account closed with no notice is exaggerated. They certainly won't close cards with annual fees just due to inactivity. I have had cards with no AF and no activity for over 400 days at a time. I also have numerous cards that have had zero balances at statement time for over 5 years.

Joe Rogan is just a commentator. He doesn't speak for the UFC. He might get the rematch anyways, so we'll have to wait and see.\n\n\nWith the results of Edgar v. Mendes though it's looking like Frankie Edgar has a better chance of a title shot. Especially since Conor knocked Aldo out cold like that so early. It almost looked like a cruel joke. \n\nWhat people forget with the Rousey rematch is that the women's divisions are not completely stacked full of contenders right now. After Holm knocked out Rousey it makes sense to do the immediate rematch because it shook things up and we had an obvious top two. Nobody was coming close to touching Rousey in that division for a long time and Holm destroyed her so by association that means there aren't many worthwhile contenders to fight Holly and especially none that can draw in the numbers like the rematch.\n\nThe featherweight division is jam packed full of badass dudes who have tons of fans. A few of them can be tough challenges to either McGregor or Aldo while also drawing big numbers. An immediate rematch after a decisive knockout like that when you have other worthwhile challengers lined up is a waste.\n\nAll that being said, Conor wants to move to lightweight as fast as he possibly can. I've heard Aldo has considered it as well since they're both huge featherweights. My ideal situation is seeing them both move up and rematching later on down the line at a heavier weight. 
Just like Kevin.

Well you do have to keep in mind most of the people you'll see downtown during the day are tourists who probably won't be in town the next day. They obviously aren't looking to make friends.\n\nYou might try going out to the bars at night or going to a place outside of downtown that facilitates your interests. For example, if you're into comics or nerdy stuff there's a great comic book shop on Tunnel Road called Comic Envy. I've had nothing but great experiences in there.\n\nIf you're a smoker looking to quit or if you're already into vaping, there are some great vape shops with really friendly vibes around town. Vape Space in South Asheville is awesome. I went to an event at Man Vs Vape on Merrimon Ave a couple weeks back and I met a bunch of friendly folks.\n\nTo be honest you just have to put yourself out there and find people that are interested in similar things. I spent a lot of time sitting in my apartment being bored but I've recently decided to leave my comfort zone and explore and it's been really rewarding. I highly recommend checking out hosted events at different places and just changing up your routine.\n\nOther than the tourists, Asheville is just as friendly as anywhere else imo. I think you'd be disappointed in the same way no matter where you went nowadays. People don't really tend to enjoy talking to random strangers in public unless they already  have a shared interest as an ice breaker. \n\nGood luck anon!

Life is life. The poachers are murderers. The rangers are stopping them. If a man went into a school with a gun and the police had a shot they would take it. I don't see how rhinos or any other animal should be any different.
All types attach themselves to movements. Malcolm X and MLK Jr were in the same movement. Does that mean the Civil Rights movement was bullshit?\n\nThink it all the way through. Every garden needs a few weeds pulled. EVERY garden.
Exactly. There are literally dozens of, if not 100s, of white millitias across the country. If a few black women get togeher and form one it = "The fuck are they talking about?"\n\n
I'm going to echo what /u/dumnezero said. I am also rarely sick, but I think that has more to do with overall healthy living (no alcohol, lots of exercise, etc) and not just being a vegan. My recovery time from a cold is lightning fast now and I think that is in part to being vegan.
I agree and I think I said as much. Veganism is certainly more moral. But I don't consider myself morally superior because I am lucky enough to have seen the evidence. Now those that have seen the evidence and choose to ignore it are certainly less moral. 
This is so true. True of both conservatives and liberals. I find myself constantly exposed to this. (I live in South Carolina for a few more months before heading back to California FINALLY)\n\nSo many people assume because THEY personally do not see it that it does not exist. This is true of sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. I feel women really get smacked with this a lot these days. I try to (not so) politely remind these types of people that not all women live in their fucking neighborhood or hang out at their Starbucks next to the yoga class that has plenty of extra parking so their BMW doesn't get dinged by a shopping cart.\n\nHow the fuck is someone going to assume or assert that these problems don't exist when they literally do not even KNOW a LGBTQ person. I mean shit I'm a bisexual transvestite and I truly do not think I have it nearly as bad as women or my gay and lesbians brothers and sisters but even I get treated like I am a unicorn around my town or I'm TOLD by straight white people that they "understand" what my life is like.... bitch, please.\n\nIt's so frustrating. 
And the libertarians cried tears of joy. 
After 2 or 3 weeks even smelling a cigarette is horrendous. I recently was in between jobs and drove a little bit for Uber to keep some cash coming in. Whenever a smoker would get in my car it nearly knocked me out. And that was only after 3 or 4 weeks quit at that point. I thought to myself so many times "I can't believe I used to smell like that."\n\nThe physical distress will pass. Use a laxative if needed. Eat a lot of fruit and drink tons of water. Make sure you are eating healthy during this process. I can't stress how important that is. Stay away from greasy foods and eat tons of fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, and fiber. Stay away from processed garbage and fast food. You will have an overwhelming amount of energy within a few days of changing your diet up.
I truly believe their ability to maintain, or reclaim power when they are down is their ability to harness the pettiness of the average American citizen. They know at the end of the day American's are mostly trashy and will do anything for a rich man that promises to hurt the people or thing that they hate.
Can I ask how you knew you were not getting enough protein and not something else? Was this self diagnosed or did you get a blood panel done by a doctor?\n\nAlso what vegetarian food added the needed protein back into your life? Eggs? Because a 6oz glass of fortified almond milk has that. Milk? Same thing, 1 6oz cup of fortified almond milk. I'm trying to figure out how cheese and eggs were giving you the extra protein that would cause your hair to fall out when you quit consuming them when all you would need to do is eat a half can of beans to make up the difference.
Isn't that just the worst? Like when the President does it every single day? About muslims, or Mexicans, or 3 million illegal votes because he is such a fucking man baby that he can't admit he lost the popular vote. Like every member of his cabinet lies and lies and lies.\n\nI guess that's why we have Alternative Facts now. Don't worry, KellyAnne Goebbels will sort this all out ;)
It is truly astounding reading the full blown delusions that people like yourself are currently living in. I've never seen anything like it in my life.\n\nBoth policies can be read online very easily. I can't figure out if everyone is just too lazy to read and just copy/pastes memes or if they simply cannot understand what they are reading. Because anyone who thinks that the two are identical after reading them both needs to see a doctor, either for vision or cognitive issues.\n\nBut let's say they were similar, which they are not, but let's say they were. Trump and his supporters call Obama the worst American president ever. They froth at the mouth when ever his name is mentioned and do nothing but call every single thing he ever did completely worthless. Yet whenever Trump gets into trouble, he simply says "Obama did it". So when Obama does it it is Terrible, but if Trump does the same thing then it is A-OK? What makes a xenophobic ban on refugees and immigrants that targets a specific religion OK simply because "Someone else did it, too... Or so I'm told by /r/The_Donald"? The least liked person by Trump Supporters besides maybe Hillary Clinton is now the basis of Trump policy? And of course all Obama supporters without question supported everything he did. Amazing. The mental gymnastics required to be a Trump supporter is mind boggling to say the least.
So true. I see it all the time and I am 35. And its not just veganism. I am a recovering alcoholic and last night at a new years party a friend was practically trying to shove champaigne down my throat. "C'mon you can have just one drink... cmon its new years." I mean why the fuck would they even care that I am drinking or not drinking and why would you EVER try to give a addict a drink? Of course I didn't cave but what if I had?\n\nI seriously think, even at a young age, we push are bad habits on others so that we can feel less shitty about our own actions. "Everyone is doing it so it." Its the normalizing of bad behavior so one no longer has to justify it.
Roald Dahl and Edward Packard were very important to me when I was young. I would have thought it was odd if one of my friends had not read a Choose Your Own Adventure book or had not read The Fantastic Mr Fox.

Call the police. Seriously. 
I'll just copy/paste my response to another user since your point is basically the same.\n\nYou need to read up on what BLM is. It is a movement. It will have many "leaders" but it does not have any official "leadership" nor it is it an official organization. No more so than would be the Occupy Movement or Woman's Lib.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement for example had many "leaders" that people looked to for answers because they already stood as community leaders or raised to the occasion inspired by the movement. These leaders varied greatly in how they thought the movement should go. Malcom X and MLKjr had VERY different views in this regard.\n\nNo one in a movement is obligated to stop and apologize for every time someone else flying the same flag fucks up. Should every muslim in a position of power or fame apologize every time a islamist is involved in a terror attack? Or should everyone Trump supporter apologize for every time he says something about grabbing pussies or any of his ludicrous lies and accusations? Of course not. Hell, Trump's base made a battle cry out of not having to apologize for his stupid rhetoric and only paying attention to if good comes from the "movement".\n\nNo matter how you try to spin this shit, if you are attacking Black Lives Matters the movement and lumping them all together for the actions of a few than you... are.... a racist. Or at very least a bigot. You believe the actions of a few condemn the many. IF one is bad than they all are bad.\n\nSo that means ALL Trump supporters are Neo nazis. Because Trump is heavily and very publicly supported by out and open white nationalists and Neo nazis. Therefor, by your logic, since Donald Trump, nor anyone in his cabinet, have openly spoke against each of these racist groups than all Trump supporters must be that way. See what I mean? See how this doesn't make sense?\n\nJust think it through, man.\n\n
Replicants like any other machine, are either a benefit or a hazard.

It will be downvoted because it's mostly total bullshit.
It is extremely high in saturated fat, can lead to rapid weight gain, increase blood insulin levels, causes heart dissease and artery damage, and the list goes on and on. There is a good research paper by the University of Melbourne you can find or look for the work of Dr, Joel Kahn.\n\nNot to mention it is a total fad. We are not biologically the same as are Paleolithic ancestors and do not have access to the things that they ate. While paleo gets a few things right, like no dairy and no processed food, it pumps the body full of fat because of a perceived notion that that is how our ancestors ate... which is patently false. Our ancestors ate mostly plants, and meat or fish when they could (which was rare). It starts on a lie and touts early "visible" benefits without studying the long term effect of a mostly meat and saturated fat diet. It shuns things like fiber and good carbs which are essential for human health.\n\nIts just another fad that confuses people and leads to poor health decisions based of pure fantasy.
Im in SC, too... So frustrating. We even protested in front of one of Graham's offices in Charleston. But they will both probably vote for her. This whole thing is just a nightmare.

Some wines and beer are not vegan due to a processing technique that involves filtering the alcohol through fish bladders or other animal byproducts. Guiness beer namely (but I heard they are changing this) as well as many white wines.\n\nBut that is not why I abstain from all alcohol. As I stated in my post you responded to, I am a recovering alcoholic.
So you do not believe in free speech? Or you believe it is OK when someone actually uses free speech that it is A-OK for the wealthy elite to use their money and resources (money and resources unavailable to 99% of all humans) to harass and bully you until you have no choice but to no longer exercise your free speech? That sure sounds like freedom to me.\n\nBut then again, you would most definitely agree it is 100% OK for us to harass and hound Melania en mass, since we don't have the cash to do it alone,  until she proves she is legal and not a prostitute. That is how it works under your rules, so we are good right?\n
"them"? This is one person we are referring to. She should be called out and made to step down has her values do not represent BLM or ANY human rights group.\n\nWe have got to stop comparing millions of people to the actions of one. Hell I am a BLM member and I am white. I obviously do not feel I am subhuman nor does science back that up in any way. This woman is a disgrace to what BLM stands for.

"Mike Pence is a wonderful man"\n\nAre you fucking kidding me? Pence is possibly one of the biggest pieces of shit in this circus of billionaires now running our government.\n\nThis is a quote from this "wonderful man" : "Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage." Here is another : "Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual’s [sic] as a 'discreet and insular minority" entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities."\n\nAh yes, denying equal rights to Americans. Just wonderful. And lets not forget his opposition to women rights and the rights of minorities. He is a vile racist and homophobe and an absolute disgrace to our country.\n\nAnd thats not the only absolutely laughable statement by this author. This article only goes to prove the absolute fantasy land that Trump supporters live in. I am not sure if it is just an innate inability to understand what they read, a 30 to 45 second memory, or just a genuine worship of anything and anyone that touts money and conservatism.\n\nIt is downright shocking that I live in a place where nearly 50% of my fellow citizens actually think that Mike Pence is a good person. I wouldn't piss on his grave due to it being an insult to my urine.
Boneless inside-out asses to be exact.

Like from the money he will make because his companies are invested in the pipelines. Funny how that just happened to be the case. \n\nIt is truly sad how completely brainwashed you people are. Drain the swamp? He made it more swampy than any other time in history. His cabinet picks will directly benefit from destroying the agencies they run. \n\nThe fact you think American tax dollars were actually paying for foreign abortions for example. You don't even know the facts about the shit you are against. Daddy said its bad and you simply believe it without any research. Just repost the meme and your job is done. \n\nIt must be nice never having to learn anything. To live in a complete fucking fantasy. But what I don't understand is how you idolize this thin skinned man baby who lies and lies and lies directly to your face. He throws temper tantrums for crowd sizes??? The man is demonstrably unfit to be a janitor at the White House let alone run our country. \n\nBy the way. That little gag order wasn't to stop social media. It was to strip the agencies ability for their scientists to speak to the public about climate change. They are banned from speaking to the press. Not just social media. They scrubbed all climate change info from their websites, too. But ya... it's about tweeting. Sure, buddy lol. \n\nBut it's ok. We will all be laughing our heads off when this bullshit party implodes. And it will. 
What style do you like? \n\nSmall fast swords like long swords or rapiers? \n\nMedium size swords/maces/axes with a shield?\n\nHuge ultra greatswords/clubs/hammers?\n\nMinimal melee with mostly spells for damage?\n\nRemember, you will always be essentially a hybrid in this game except for one build (quality build) and even with that once you pass soul level 180 or so you will start leveling up magic skills anyway. \n\nMy strategy is to grab something like the fire longsword early on which is easy to do and evenly level vigor, strength, dexterity to around 30, then put endurance to 20 and get agility to 100. Upgrade your weapon as you go to things like bastard sword or just stick with a mace or longsword. Buy a 100 defense medium shield and you'll be good to go for a long time.\n\nAfter awhile you can level a rapier to +10 and 2habd that sucker and melt bosses. Look out to grab the Leo ring, ring of blades, and stone ring and get a good bow or level up a short bow to +10. Makes the game easy mode. Learn to dodge well and don't worry about armor much. Just use light armor like the Aurous set which you can get very early. Use a shield when clearing tight areas where you can't roll much or large crowds. You can atrack with a rapier while blocking and do crazy counter damage.  Once you are to Drangleic or so you can start thinking about specializing and respec if needed with a soul vessel. You'll want a solid health pool and enough levels to get plenty of attunement slots and either go Str/Int or Hex/Dex. There are plenty of resources you can find by googling those builds. \n\nSpell builds are very underpowered to start. It's best to stick to melee, collect spells and get at least 100 levels before you switch. \n\nThis of course is all my opinion as anything is possible in any souls game. People beat the game by staying level 1 with broken short swords. Anyone can "get gud" and make any build viable. But I find my method is best if you are new or returning and don't know the meta well. \n\nAlso, stay away from infusions until you understand scaling. \n\nHope this helps. I typed it on my phone so sorry if it's scatter brained. 
Bahhahaahhahaha!\n\nI needed a good laugh. Thank!
The ol' Vitamin I-O-B12 argument. Stumps them pesky vegans every time!
I feel this is a loaded question. But I'll answer it anyway.\n\nI flat out do believe that not eating animals or using animal by-products is definitely morally superior to the opposite. I made a choice in my life years ago to stop living one type of life and live another. I did this for moral reasons, not as a diet or a fad, but for solely moral reasons. I am a ethical vegan.\n\nNow, does that make me morally superior? You tell me. I made a choice to live a more moral life. I do believe that meat eaters are less moral, but is it their fault always? No. Most of the time? No. Meat eaters are lied to constantly and raised to believe certain things just like I was. I was a meat eater MOST of my life. It took many years to see the error of my ways and I don't think that I am magically better than someone else simply because I read the right study or was exposed to X truth or Y lie. \n\nMany people simply do not have the right information and are conditioned to live a certain way. I am not better than a person because I found the right information and they didn't. Our society pushes the consumption of animal products with such fervor that it would be very foolish to view one's self as superior simply for breaking free. It would be like breaking out of prison then calling the rest of the prisoners scum.\n\nThat being said, do meat eaters commonly view us as claiming to be morally superior? Yes. This is a fact. Do the large majority of us actually make this claim? No. Many of us fight tooth and nail to spread the information that we found to others that have not been exposed to the truth behind the food they eat or that were never faced with moral concerns of harvesting the flesh and skin of sentient beings for our benefit and amusement. Meat eaters, when confronted with veganism, are internally made to question their own beliefs. Since no one wants to be wrong, and no one wants to admit they have been lied to for years or decades, people lash out us by calling us names and projecting onto us. We are only here to spread the word and live our lives. To attempt to make a small difference and save a few lives along the way, both human (through health) and non-human (murder). \n\nOne way of living is definitely morally superior but we are not here to rub anyones nose in it. How completely ridiculous would that be considering you probably saw most of us chowing on a hamburger a few years ago, or for some young vegans here maybe even weeks or months ago? Becoming a vegan doesn't wash away the years we spent doing the same thing other meat eaters did and do.\n\nMy goal is not to be superior, it is to help others find a way to climb to where I have. To see the error of their own ways and join us in finding harmony with the world around us. To increase the well being of all sentient beings that we share this planet with and to dramatically increase our own health and well being in the process.\n\nI'm not sure if this answers your question but I'll elaborate on anything if you need me to. Cheers.
I just wish they'd let Washington, Oregon, California secede from the nation. Their combined economies would equal the 5th or 6th biggest economy in the world. We would be just fine and we'll all get gay married to our vegan trans lovers while driving electric cars in our bubble. They can fuck right off. I have no problem giving 90% of the country to these clowns so long as they promise to leave us the fuck alone.
Fucking our country and the world, people dying as a result of policy, allying with war criminals, going to war, etc..... Hilarious.\n\nI think we already know what America thinks:  Not. That. Much.
Or just go vegan ;)
They did get the red storm.
Nope you can respec as many times as you like. Each time costs 1 soul vessel. You will find somewhere around 10 each play though but they are very easily farmable once you get the the Giant memories.\n\nrapiers are beast. It's pretty much all I use. I keep a fume sword in my offhand in case I need horizontal slashes, but for the most part I just 2 hand a rapier. I hit for around 600 a hit and can pull off 5 and sometimes 6 hit combos with my endurance at 40. Poke 2 win :)
It's funny how the same people that call a BLM a hate group because they see a youtube video of a person claiming to represent BLM acting like an idiot and they think EVERY single BLM member is that way. Yet they do not make public statements every time a white group does something racist. As a matter of fact they do everything they can to NOT say anything.\n\nThe very idea they are promoting, that of condemning many for the actions of few is at the very heart of racism. They are telling us a group is racist while they themselves are being racist towards that group... I mean its dizzying.
That is their "proof"???\n\nBahhaha. Did you laugh and walk away? I know I wouldn't have been able to hold it together.
LOVE IT
Agreed there. 
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer!\n\nedit: What a weird post to downvote...
They retweeted a photo of the comparison between Trump and Obama's inauguration crowds which showed Trump having less than half of the crowd. How is that even in the same ballpark, let alone sport, as someone vomiting out extremely racist and sexist remarks about the First Lady?\n\nActually never mind, I really have zero interest in arguing with you.
>Something must be linked\n\nAbsolutely not true. Not trying to be a dick here but you are not a doctor nor a nutritionist. People need to stop self-diagnosing these issues. It literally could have been any number of things and if for any reason your hair starts falling out its time to see a doctor, not start eating cheese.\n\nThere is absolutely no way that adding dairy and eggs back into your life is adding some colossal amount of protein back into your diet because dairy and eggs simply do not have that much protein. We are not talking beef here. Seriously, a bowl of cereal with some Ripple milk in the morning and a half a cup of any number of vegetables will add as much protein as you are going to get from dairy and eggs throughout your day only without all of the fat, cholesterol, and death.\n\nTaking the time to learn basic nutrition and how the body works is paramount when becoming a vegan. No self diagnostics or anecdotal perceived problems will ever outweigh hard science. If your hair was seriously falling out, and you thought it was due to protein, why not just.... eat more vegan protein? Have a vegan protein shake in the morning? I mean seriously, I am not trying to be a dick here I swear but this sorta thing is exactly what gives vegans a bad name.
I'm at 42 days. Its tough but after the first week it gets much, much easier. It actually doesn't take very long to break the nicotine addiction. Its the social addiction that lingers. Fortunately, with a little willpower and the right attitude you can overcome that. I went cold turkey after 20 years of smoking 2 packs a day. Trust me, you can do it my friend!!\n\nKeep hanging on!
the greasy trash fire they call Rush Limbaugh is now called Politics? \n\nWow.
The breast milk argument has to be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard. We are biologically setup to feed our young with breast milk. It is a consensual act between mother and infant. This is the same type of ignorant hypothetical as the "What if you were stranded on a desert island with a cow" scenario.\n\nI have also heard the is "swallowing sperm vegan" scenario. \n\nI don't even humor these infinitely silly questions. If someone wants to ask me a serious question I will answer it, but I don't think it is worth my time or energy to give validity to a meat eater desperately grasping at straws to attempt to validate their eating habits. Vegans make meat eaters feel bad because our lifestyle causes them to have to evaluate their own beliefs. If vegans are right than they are wrong, so they fight tooth and nail to invalidate veganism in every way and these sad and idiotic questions are only proof of that.
Whatever you need to tell yourself, buddy ;)\n\nYou have a wonderful day now.
Anyone who thought or said the "republicans will keep them sane" or that it's not going to be as bad as they said on the campaign was lying to themselves. \n\nEveryone needs to brace themselves for a full blown attack on the LGBTQ community by the religious right. They are going to go after marriage equality and transgender rights.\n\nEveryone keeps scratching their head and saying "Why doesn't the republican senate stop them... etc." Because this is EXACTLY what republicans have wanted since Reagan. They could not be happier. And Trumps base? They could not be happier that they can all be openly racist now. This is a fucking dream come true and everyone is still acting like our new authoritarian nightmare was just "Campaign rhetoric."\n\nEveryone needs to wake the fuck up. (edit. Can't believe I am actually having to say this line... They've made us sound like the conspiracy theorists while they openly peddle lies and half-truths to blind their base. Now we just seem like the "crazies" as they dismantle our democracy. Brilliant actually.)
^ This just in from Dellusionland. Where Daddy is always right.
Well said. My exact thoughts.\n\nThey are doing this because they know trump will hurt people. He will bring pain to their particular brand of hate or intolerance and they'll scorch the earth around them to see their target suffer. \n\nThey are fully aware of the hypocrisy. This is an army of internet trolls. 
Be very careful working out that much when you cannot guarantee you are getting all of your needed calories and nutrients. You can put yourself in the hospital. Crossfitters do this all of the time when not on a budget let alone when you are trying to feed yourself 15 times a week at least for $25.\n\nYou need to figure out how much calories you can get in you on that budget first before deciding on an very intense workout plan.\n\nI'm not really sure I can offer much advice outside of eating tons of rice and lentils but I definitely wouldn't think $25 a week can afford you a vegan diet that can keep you healthy through an intense crossfit regiment. I strongly recommend looking at another form of working out like maybe starting with bicycling, yoga + jogging, etc. The diet alone is going to make you drop serious weight.
The_Donald is a troll circle jerk. I don't understand why anyone wants to try to attempt to 'reach out' to them. It's essentially 4chan over there. Do you really think common sense or logic will be met with anything but vitriol or childishness?\n\nI commend you trying to help, man, but you are seriously yelling at a wall.
Try not to judge that entire group based on a few idiots that don't realize Hillary herself was against the TPP towards the end.\n\nAlso, are they seriously implying that ANYTHING Trump does has to be fought even if it benefits America and the world? Isn't that exactly what republicans did to Obama for 6 years?\n\nReddit never ceases to amaze me. But serious, this is not ALL Hillary supporters. Lets not start lumping everyone together like the right does.
COME. ON. MAN.
I don't see the selfie stick... is this one of those selfie drones??? The future, man...
Neither do we... neither do we.
I ride a motorcycle and have been hit more than one by those types of sprayers
You need to read up on what BLM is. It is a movement. It will have many "leaders" but it does not have any official "leadership" nor it is it an official organization. No more so than would be the Occupy Movement or Woman's Lib.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement for example had many "leaders" that people looked to for answers because they already stood as community leaders or raised to the occasion inspired by the movement. These leaders varied greatly in how they thought the movement should go. Malcom X and MLKjr had VERY different views in this regard.\n\nNo one in a movement is obligated to stop and apologize for every time someone else flying the same flag fucks up. Should every muslim in a position of power or fame apologize every time a islamist is involved in a terror attack? Or should everyone Trump supporter apologize for every time he says something about grabbing pussies or any of his ludicrous lies and accusations? Of course not. Hell, Trump's base made a battle cry out of not having to apologize for his stupid rhetoric and only paying attention to if good comes from the "movement".\n\nNo matter how you try to spin this shit, if you are attacking Black Lives Matters the movement and lumping them all together for the actions of a few than you... are.... a racist. Or at very least a bigot. You believe the actions of a few condemn the many. IF one is bad than they all are bad.\n\nSo that means ALL Trump supporters are Neo nazis. Because Trump is heavily and very publicly supported by out and open white nationalists and Neo nazis. Therefor, by your logic, since Donald Trump, nor anyone in his cabinet, have openly spoke against each of these racist groups than all Trump supporters must be that way. See what I mean? See how this doesn't make sense?\n\nJust think it through, man.\n\n
Congrats!!\n\nI do this all the time. I'll accidentally order a beer at a restaurant or function and once it arrives I have to let it sit there or give it away. Its led to a lot of awkward conversations with wait staff. "Is something wrong with your drink, sir?" "Um, no... I ordered it by mistake."
Oh I agree. Liberals in general can be very self righteous at times. Not all of course but its definitely out there. You are right though about Trump supporters simply embracing the hypocrisy. Even more so they have developed a way to flip any criticisms into a personal attack on them. If they support a white nationalist and a liberal points it out, then that liberal is simply oppressing white people and is now the actual racist. The use of "alternative facts" and the like has become pretty shocking. And what upsets me the most is that it seems that Hillary supporters and other liberals are now just fanning the fire instead of taking action to stop the spread of this nationalism and populism.\n\nIt seems to me its time better spent calling a senator, voting local, organizing a rally, etc then pissing and moaning about Trump voters post election. I agree 100% that so many people are definitely not taking the high road and instead simply helping dig the ditch we all now are forced to live in. \n\nWhile I do not think I owe anything to the "forgotten midwest voter" who supports a demagogue because they didn't get a special nod or do not understand why the "factories closed down", I certainly am not going to lower myself to their level. I have real work to do.
To that I say bring on the consequences. The only consequences I see are the ones Trump and the Gang are now dealing with. Like having to learn they are not a dictatorship, how us "whining sore losers" are not going to stand by idly, and that we will be no more critical of Donald or Melania than they, and their ilk, were to Barack and Michelle.
I'll just copy and paste what I posted in response to another user as I feel your response is the same.\n\nYou need to read up on what BLM is. It is a movement.

I wish I could upvote you more than once.
Trump just put a gag order on the EPA and USDA, pushed through the Dakota and Keystone XL pipelines, banned abortion aid globally, is gearing up to pen laws to ban muslim immigrants and refugees, and is about to announce the construction of a wall on our border with Mexico...\n\nI could literally not care less about Baron fucking Trump.
Oh they do. You just fly to your private school in the helicopter everyone gets when they become millionaires because: Free Market.\n\nI mean, there is no way that they would all die on welfare like Ayn Rand... No way at all.
You didn't hear? The POTUS can brag about sexual assault, publicly call on a foreign entity to hack our government, and ask his followers to assault critics. \n\nBeing a dick is now called "being presidential." Try to keep up. 
No you wouldn't.\n\nAnd nor has anyone now that laws are allowing equal rights for transgendered folk.\n\nShow me where all of these pedophile are wearing dresses. Show me the police cases.\n\nProvide evidence or shut up.
Possibly. I wasn't really wanting to match anything up. Just throwing out another favorite that had to do with the Death Star fights.\n\n/shrug
TMI, but thanks for the advice
Wow. Now that is some clickbait. I think your headline is missing a few words...\n\nBut, seriously. This woman is a racist, obviously. But she is NOT representative of ALL BLM members or local chapters. I am a member of BLM and I am white and I certainly do not share these views. The president of the United States is a racist but I don't consider all Americans racist.\n\nOf course the Trump people and right-wingers will spin this into BLM the movement is now a "reverse racism" movement and all that lunacy but it's best to just ignore them. Don't feed the fire. Instead, we need to make sure we are vetting our own and calling them out when they say horrible things or turn out like this lady to be racists.\n\nThere are crazy people on both sides. Everyone needs to remember that.
This batch came out great!\n\nHomemade seitan (I steam mine for a more chicken-y texture) soaked in almond milk and broth, then rolled in flour, oats, corn meal, salt, pepper, turmeric, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, nooch - redipped in liquid and rolled again - then friend in vegetable oil.\n\nMashed tomatoes are homemade garlic smashed petite white potatoes and TJ's roasted corn and Annie's biscuits. My secret is to dip the chicken and roll it in breading twice.\n\nThought I'd share :) If anyone wants more detail on the recipe just inbox me.
Upside down, no less. He's such a rebel!\n\n/eyeroll\n\nStraight people across the nation pointing to their TV screens at a clueless billionaire holding a flag upside down. "SEE! SEE! He loves the gays!"\n\nI mean I knew people were stupid but this is a new low.
Shit, I can't predict the next 4 *minutes* with this fucking circus of a administration, let alone 4 years.
I would have. I also don't really go around announcing it to people but in this situation I feel that girl might greatly benefit from seeing a healthy, adult vegan and someone that has her back. Otherwise she may feel that it is actually just a fad and abandon it all together.\n\nI'm 6'3, covered head to toe in tattoos and Id like to think I am pretty fashionable (brag alert!! lol) so when I see a young person curious about veganism I always state that I am and defend them. I've been in similar situations and having the "cool older guy" have their back is a very noticeable boost in their self esteem and confidence about going vegan. I know it sounds silly but peer pressure is a bitch and we gotta protect our own, regardless of age.\n\nI get this situation a lot when young 15 - 18 year old kids are bagging my groceries at the local market. They'll ask things like "What is meatless meat?" or they will see "vegan" on a product and start asking questions. Almost laways the older cashier person will make a anti-vegan comment and I'll simply respond that "Don't listen to them kid, I've been a vegan for a many years and its the best thing that ever happened to me." Now I've got two kids at the local market that run over to me and ask me questions every time I come in.\n\nBe a loud and proud vegan! :)
Check out Vega brand. They have a myriad of different protein powders including versions that have full servings of vegetables in them as well. They sell it at GNC or Whole Foods, etc.
I know. I am a recovering alcoholic. I do not drink any alcohol, vegan or otherwise. I am just saying that me being a teetotaler and keeping a good exercise schedule has more to do with me not getting sick than my being a vegan, but that being a vegan I think helps with my recovery from illness.
Are we talking about her work history or immigration status?
This is demonstrably wrong. Anyone who wants to take even 5 minutes to look up gun violence statistics will see that women are no safer with guns than without. As a matter of fact, women are far more likely to be victims of gun violence from their own firearms, or firearms kept in the house either by an aggressor or by themselves or their children than they are to stop a "bad guy."\n\nSpreading the myth that adding more guns to the equation somehow makes us safer is downright dangerous and a sad and tired myth spread by those interested in the manufacturing and distribution of firearms.\n\nI am not trying to be a jerk here, but please do some research on this before you spread lies.
It is downright comical that anyone would be offended by the word "fuck" on a live news broadcast of a protest. \n\nThe now leader of the free world can be heard on every news network on the planet bragging about sexually assaulting women by "grabbing them by the pussy" and everyone is sad that Madonna said "fuck"? I seriously can't stop laughing at the staggering irony. \n\nMaybe real life isn't for everyone.
Thats the point. People don't care, especially Trump voters. They just want Daddy to tell them what to think and say.
A very simple google search will provide all the answers you look for. There are plenty of vegan bodybuilding websites and some of the worlds top atheltes are vegan, including various world's strongest men, distance athletes, weightlifters, fighters, cyclists, runners, swimmers, etc etc.\n\nIt is incredibly easy to build mass with just plant-based foods. It's also far cheaper and does less damage to your body.
Faith is kinda terrible for PVE after the nerfs they did way back when. I'd recommend changing up to a hex build. Even a 30/30 build will outshine a "cleric" build in every conceivable way if your wanting to use spells.\n\nIf you are planning on just using the faith for lightning damage scaling then I wouldn't really call that a cleric. More of a paladin. You will be mostly melee.\n\nEdit. I run a Robflynn quality build (50/40) with 25/25 int/faith (with black hood) and I love it. Im absolutely unstoppable with melee and when needed I can fall back on 63 dark orbs (think Giant Lord fight) and resonant weapon and resins for buffing. I have spiced down all of the faith and Int utility spells I situationally need as well.
And my locker room talk for them is: "We are going to get this orange clown with a baby dick out of our White House."\n\nIf they don't like it they can try and stop us.
Other than the fact she doesn't look, act, or sound, or do ANYTHING like the character Claire Underwood or that she is no where near accomplished and respected.\n\nThey don't even dress alike. These are literally just pictures of Melania wearing clothes that are the same color as clothing Claire Underwood wore. If I found a picture of her in a red shirt would she then be turning in to beloved 90s comedian Sinbad? https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oO8oSbfbL-Q/hqdefault.jpg\n\n\n\n
You have mine for sure :)\n\nI wish people would just see how amazing it is to be an ally. To stop and put aside bias and just lend a helping hand to those that are marginalized by a system that forgot them or simply does not care. People think being an ally means they must admit some wrong doing, or demonize their own race, or switch political parties or something...\n\n I think about it even day. How do I communicate to other white people that I don't "hate myself" or other white people. I don't want minorities to have "more" rights... just the same rights. I don't think white people with dreadlocks are "evil." Why can't people just stop seeking out the crazy extremists in every group and just stop and see that lending a hand to people is a very rewarding and joyful part of the human experiment.\n\nBut I think what drives me crazy the most is that while pointing fingers at one person and blaming the group when referring to BLM these very SAME people see no problem with the leaders of white nationalist groups publicly attaching themselves to the Donald Trump movement. Somehow its different for them. If a black person with racist ideas joins BLM then all BLM is racist. If literally dozens of predominant white nationalists from around the world join the Trump train it has zero correlation. It's sad that people are so selfish and so unwilling to help others that all logic escapes them in order to defend their own selfishness. What a animal we are, both capable of empathy and malice.
This looks like a capture from a 90s adventure game I would have loved to play. Brilliant!
Who needs a mouse when your trackpad is the size of Wyoming?
Action not words.  That is what we need from the DNC chair.  We know where Perez is in his views.   Ellison has support of the progressive base, but will most likely be abandoned (even if he wins) should he continue the move right by the party.   At that point, I would hope that a real third party will rise.  Progressives cannot sit back and support another Hillary as someone who is the lesser evil.   Unfortunately, every candidate that has been mentioned as a possible choice, fits that bill.   It is a long way away at this point.  Hopefully, we can get someone to run with some actual progressive street cred

Banks don't make much money, if any from your accounts any more.   They could really care less if you leave or not.  The only thing it is going to do is support your local bank.  That isn't a bad thing.    If your local bank is any good at all it will most likely be swallowed up by one of the large ones

I really hope you are right.   Dems have disappointed me my entire life.  
Now you will be blown away instead like the folks kite surfing.  Make sure to live stream it
some would argue that we are moving back in that direction 
I agree.   We have had folks ask us for advice when getting a home machine and we recommend them for purchase for home as well.   We have had a couple go with the slightly cheaper home model and when they break down in a year and their warranty is already up, they get to buy a new one.
Thanks for the info.  We moved away from HP because of their poor support for desktops.
You brought shit to a piss fight
delete the account and set it up again.   We see that quite a bit on both android and iphone.   Setting the account up again on the device should fix it
Me either
as a matter of habit, I never upgrade video drivers unless they are fixing a problem that I am having.   The same with printer drivers as well
My guess is that it is a MS problem.   When they update things in their network it seems to happen.

She has become much less progressive as time goes on.  When she was on air america she wasn't as polished, but couldn't doubt her positions.  She is an establishment mouthpiece now ignoring facts
She has long since been eliminated as a candidate for president by any progressive groups.  Only the groups that wanted someone like Hillary still consider her a candidate.   Maybe they can throw Webb in there again to make her look like a good candidate

I agree.  It is a handy skill to have to repair rims since they are so expensive to replace.  Seems like it takes a lot of practice though
I hate to hear things like this.   It isn't the first time I did though.    I actually went and bought a camera for my bike so that if an accident happens, I would have evidence.

Comparing what GM is and will offer and what Tesla offers is really off base.   They aren't comparable in any way other than they are both electric vehicles.
You are fooling yourself if you think GM has quality anything.  They are all about profit, not quality.   You go ahead and buy one though.  I am sure you will enjoy it
They must have just changed it with this new version.  It is still one of the best cleaners out there on the market.   We looked at it for one of my clients, and are still considering it as a supplement for their current scanner
yep, it is fun when you get that call.   I don't know what happened, but it is running really slow now and these ads are popping up on the screen.  We have some good ones as well, just not as many as the others.  They like doing searches for reviews on their books then not paying attention to the place it has been reviewed by.   
As long as the Dems keep running Blue dogs, I don't care if they ever win again. As a matter of fact, it would be better if they didn't.  Having a government that is just slightly less regressive isn't anything to consider worth fighting for

He isn't a whole lot better than the loon in the White House 
I had a buddy with a 78 bronco that had a blowout of one of the rubber lines while going down a steep hill.   He managed to stop.   He got a ride to the auto parts and got the part and replaced it on the side of the road.   Never replaced the other side.  3 or 4 months later the same thing happened, only this time on the other side.
I work at a university that is about 90% dell, and during the capacitor plague, they sent out cases of motherboards to us after they started going bad.   Most places have their own techs, so they either replaced them all at once or gave the option to have a tech come and spend time doing it.    They were willing to replace them even if they hadn't failed.   \n\nI give them credit for being proactive on this

Public schools, yes.  We as a country benefit by teaching science, math etc.  I don't want one second taken away from those subjects for religion.  If they want to concentrate heavily on their private schools, then have at it.
You don't want that to happen.   We will have a member of the christian taliban running the country then

We had a couple of collaboration type servers that never got updated.  There were 2 different groups assigned to do it and each thought the other was doing it.  Quite a failure in communication.
I don't have any recent experience with this latest driver set, but in the past when this has happened I either downloaded a beta version of the driver or went back a version to an older version.  If you do find one that works, make sure to disable the auto update on it.\n\nI hope that helps

Sometimes a clean install is the best way.  \n\n You can't install an OS from within a working OS.   Usually there is a recovery option when you boot up your machine, or possibly something from the manufacturer in the start menu that will launch a recovery.   From there, you can choose different options (repair, or complete reinstall)   I have seen some manufacturers have you hit a key when it is booting up as well to launch the recovery.

Save your quarter.  NC senators pretty much tow the party line.  Democrats can't seem to find someone worth voting for, so they aren't worried about being voted out.   I have contacted them on several issues and have to say that I feel like I am ignored 
At one time I would say HP, but we completely went from a full HP shop to a full Dell shop because of support.   We buy business machines and there is a huge difference in business machines versus home machines.   By default, both come with a pretty basic warranty.  If I am not mistaken, both are a depot (ship in) warranty.\n\nI don't know if HP support has improved in the 6 years since we left them or not.  I am not willing to chance it at this point.   We get the next business day warranty for our machines from dell.   We get optiplex and Latitude machines.   They really aren't that much more expensive and tend to outlast the home machines. Out of the 50 or so we get a year, we usually only have a couple with issues.   We had one with a bad power supply and a couple laptops that the main board failed.  That is pretty stable each year.   \n\nI hope someone chimes in with actual consumer grade experience for you.   
Interesting project.   Post pics if you do it.   I don't see why it wouldn't work as long as the center is large enough for your spokes.   Pulling the spokes just sounds like a whole world of problems.

In terms of a game, STRICTLY video game here, let me change the analogy.\n\nYou paid $##.## to watch a movie in theaters.  Person X decides they want to text during the movie, and their ringtone is all the way up.  Person X's consistent cell phone usage is making the movie viewing experience less immersive and enjoyable than it should, but it is enhancing X's experience.  Should that be allowed, that someone should diminish someone else's value of the experience?\n\nFor me, both are a no go.  Neither are a crime, but should not be allowed.  If person X gets removed from the theater, or you get banned from using the exploit, that is on you.
>So after basically threatening to have her fired by talking to my first sgt she relented and allowed me to test\n\nSorry, not sorry, but after this line you got what you get.  Most places, if you are 1 minute late, you're done, you fail, goodbye.  But really, you sound like you're digging.  Take the failure, and move on.  Don't make a shit show out of it.  Most people will just hear it as excuses.  Be honest, and retake in 42-90 days and move on.  It's not career ending (I was still allowed to promote to SSgt after 2 failed PT tests within a year).  But if you make a shit show of it, you're not going to get anywhere.

Screws have play. The glue will snap off a portion of the wood, then the screws come into play for an already failed joint.  https://youtu.be/WMi6W2cvw7g . This video shows what I mean more clearly.  You want to increase surface area for the glue to hold onto, the screws add very little.
This.  Also, if all you are able to do is listen to videos discussing the subject, then Khan Academy is the place to go.  I passed Microeconomics purely from watching Khan Academy.

I made this: https://quizlet.com/184258790/intro-to-world-religion-dsst-flash-cards/\n\nI studied that for a week along with some practice tests.  Went from an Atheist knowing nothing (Practice test at 26%) to passing in a week.  I used almost exclusively those questions.  I did test > options > multiple choice only > any number of questions (Usually 50) and did that over and over again.  I made those based off of practice tests that I took.\n\nEDIT:  I took it this past Thursday for perspective and passed.  Those questions a bit of history such as the split of Protestantism and Catholicism, and a bit of emphasis on sects of religions.  That should get you there.  If you already have a decent foundation, than that will make it easier.  I knew absolutely nothing when I started.

> giving new players a simple dust or card boost\n\nDefinitely this.  The solution has to be in the format, not the collection.  Imagine giving a new MTG player a starter deck, and then 1,000 cards extra right out of the gate.  It becomes overwhelming and could discourage them to continue.  Introducing the cards over time through pack openings once they are already used to the card they have, and through play is ideal.

The example is just the easiest thing in memory for me to look up.  I have, however, been shut out from discussing something purely on my gender/race in the past though.  I suppose that, due to my lack of social skills, I have commonly been shut out or ignored many times when I try to explain something (typically useless stuff, but sometimes co-workers will start bullshitting mid explanation  for pass down) and this situation is something that I have commonly played over in my head.  I usually conclude that most people will be reasonable with it, but I am always curious on the variance.
Not luck.  He has 2 minions in his deck, and that is both.  Trump started playing that deck lately, it's a little bit of a luck tempo play.

I was a Sanders supporter/voter turned Johnson voter for November.  There are many things of Johnson I do not support, but he is the one who makes the most sense of the four remaining contenders.\n\nI would not call myself Libertarian, I am quite left leaning in fact.  I do not support his ideas on healthcare and FAIR tax.  But I do support the gun rights and more state level control.  But the candidate that lined up close to the +85% range with my ideals was Sanders.  The other three have disqualified themselves for me.\n\nEdit:\n\nHeck, I still have my Sanders for President 2016 bumper sticker on my car.

Exactly this.  No other reason.  I typed "Murloc" into the search and just started to dump cards in.  The 100 gold quest.  I did hunter too for that deck for a win 3 games with hunter quest.

The basics of learning to program starts with what is called "Pseudo Code".  It is where you think of what you need, and lay it out in a code fashion in such a way you can read it clearly, step by step.\n\nThe easiest way I can think of doing it is making a "Portrait" prefab that will have the functionality you want.  The constructor could load up an image, and assign the image as the renderer.  Something to the tune of:\n\n/* image could be any image.  If the portraits are stored in the resource directory, then a Resources.Load<Texture2D>("Portrait Name")\nOr a player prefab could have it stored as a value and send it there.\nposition would be the location on screen it is place, such as: new Vecter2D(100, 100)\nlayer would work just like it does in RPG Maker.*/\n\npublic portrait(Texture2D image, Vertex2D position, int layer)\n\nYou would then put the code in there to parse that data.\n\nIf you want to make games, one of the most useful skills to learn is to learn how to read documentation.  [Here](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Renderer.html) is the Renderer page on the Unity API.

I will give you a little bit of background on the topic.\n\nWhen Clinton conceded to Obama in 2008, an apparent deal was made for 2016.  When Obama took office, he called the DNC chair.  The DNC chair stepped down, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz took his place.  DWS was a co-chair for the Clinton campaign.  Fast forward to 2016, Tim Caine is chosen as vice president.  Tim Caine was the DNC chair in 2008 who stepped down.  What that shows is this was planned.\n\nClinton has kept her hands very clean this entire process, but it is obvious her campaign and the DNC were colluding together with the Mainstream Media this whole election (MSM).  Similar attack lines were used by Clinton supporters in 08 that was used in 16. "Obama Boys" and "Bernie Bros" for example, and they tried to claim they had no part of it.\n\nThen comes the emails.  The DNC chair, DWS, claimed to be neutral in the race.  However, later in a debate with Tim Canova, she stated a lot of work was done to ensure Clinton would be the nominee.  Email leaks show that the current DNC chair (After DWS stepped down) was sending emails against Sanders, to include using atheism against him.\n\nThe only person in the DNC with integrity in the situation was Tulsi Gabbard.  She removed herself from her position on the board of the DNC to endorse Sanders.  Email leaks reflect how damaging that would be for her career from her fellow DNC members.\n\nTL:DR The people in power at the DNC, AKA establishment, played dirty tricks to make Clinton the nominee and lied about it.\n\nLook up the WikiLeaks articles if you want to know more.

It's not laziness, it's due to the strain on computational power.  Primitive based collision is much easier on hardware than polygon based.  Each polygon added is another calculation to every other object.  Adding those braces in would be 40-70 polygons per brace, that is a lot of math that would increase instability on the servers.  It's super easy to make the calculations polygon based, just use the mesh it came from.  But it takes work to optimize it for server stability.

Is your older cat a boy or a girl?\n\nI had a male cat that we introduced to a bunch of kittens that our neighbors had and we had to move him because he started attacking them, I think because he saw them as either prey or competition.\n\nNo kitten was hurt, by the way. We kept a very close eye on him and as soon as he started smacking them, I grabbed him.
I'm so sorry master-san.

I understand this and as a consumer, don't really give two shits. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect significant improvements in an HD port (otherwise, why would I even buy this in the first place?), especially because it's very much possible to make ports that run at higher framerates than the original. \n\n*Examples:* Team Ico Collection, God of War Collection, Halo MCC, Resident Evil 4 on PC, REmake and RE0 PC ports and a few others.\n\nWhy should you pay money for a half assed product? \n\n\n\n
Never pay more than 36 bucks and 73 cents on a game.

I don't know if he did a European tour recently and he doesn't have anything other than Boston announced for the next couple of days, but you can subscribe to him on [his website](https://louisck.net/tour-dates) and he always sends out a mass email to his fans when his tour dates are announced (maybe even before he officially announces them elsewhere).\n\nGuy's awesome towards his fans.

Angry Joe [threw a childish tantrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3afubBLsS1I) and cried a bit on camera a couple of years ago because he thought his YouTube money was going to dry up.\n\nThat's by far the most pathetic thing I've seen on YouTube,
Again, I understand what you're saying. There *are* great technical difficulties to bringing a proper port of a PS2 game to PC. However, they probably wouldn't have to REMAKE THE WHOLE GAME ENTIRELY to get it running 60fps on PC if it were handed off to an experienced studio.\n\nAnd again, I will say, why should **you** as a consumer, pay for a game that is a **mediocre port** of the original when proper ports of similar type have been done?\n\nBluepoint games didn't even have all of the original resources for all of their HD ports and they managed to fucking reverse engineer retail release copies of the game to produce a proper port. \n\n* God of War Collection\n* The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection\n* Metal Gear HD Collection\n* Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection\n\nAll excellent examples of proper, enhanced ports that run properly on modern hardware. \n\nAnyways, never settle for a 30fps PC port.

I pick 2012.\n\nSounds like you need to build a better rig. There are only a couple of games that I can think of off the top of my head that are REALLY tricky (Cryostasis for example) to get to run at 60fps unless you're running on almost decade old hardware.\n\n
I guess that's fair, but those are all notoriously shit ports. I haven't bought any of the games that you listed mostly due to the fact that I don't want to give money to a company that makes a bad product.\n\nStill solid point and I get it.
You can buy a vacuum and use it once or twice a week and it won't be an issue.\n\nAlso spray off any internal dust once a year or so.\n\nAgain, a non issue unless you live in a coal mine.

Thanks for explaining how comforters work, buddy!\n\nThere's no doubt that heat affects the fragile electronic components' lifespan. In my experience with consumer electronics over the last 25 years, however, is that putting things on your lap, on the carpet or on the bed doesn't significantly affect their lifespan so much that you should be this anal about it.\n\nExposure to sun does significantly increase your risk of getting skin cancer. That doesn't mean you shouldn't go outside ever or be in the sun in moderation. The risk is fairly negligible in the grand scheme of things.

That's really sad, I hope he's better now.\n\nI had a dumb Tonkinese cat as a kid, who actively ate any kind of string you left out. Rubber bands, sewing string, thin strips of cloth. This motherfucker *LOVED* eating string so much so that it wasn't uncommon to see a sewing string hanging from his cathole.\n\nMy mother used to sew clothes as a hobby and this dummy of a cat ate a strip of silk he snagged while she wasn't watching. He started acting strange, lethargic, lost his appetite and was meowing in pain. We took him to a couple vets, did X-rays, physicals and they couldn't figure it out. A couple weeks later he died during a surgery when another vet finally figured out that it was a piece of cloth clogging up his intestines, so it wouldn't show on X-rays or during physicals and decided to operate right there at home.\n\nReally sad stuff, but the worst thing is that that dummy lived his last couple of weeks in pain :(
Hopefully not.
Probably lupus.
I didn't even realize FFX and X-2 remasters were on PC.\n\nHow are they as ports?\n\n**Edit:** Seems that it's locked at 30fps, which is pretty goddamn absurd for a PC port these days. Shitbirds.
The locked 30fps alone makes it a bad port in my book.\n\nPass.\n\n30 frames per second is really some mediocre stuff these days. Downvote me all you want, but that is a shit practice and you're the problem.

Well, what would get your rocks off? Murder? Rape? Macaroni refrigerator art? Robbing banks? Mining for Gold? If you could do anything what would you do? 
Ok, I guess I'll have to explain it too you slowly.... \n\nOld and dying people need healthcare and social security. Two things that Clinton and her corporate whore friends are trying to stop because all the wealth is owned by the 1% and since we have to pay for them somehow, old, dying people mean more taxes for Clinton's donors. \n\nThe older people get, the more they see that the establishment is out to fuck them over. That is why Clinton and her liberal-in-name-only movements are failing at every turn. The people are too well informed to not see the bullshit any more. I don't want the old people to die, they will be on our side by the time the next primary rolls around. 
If he's just an old putz, why is Trump so afraid of him? Why is the democratic party so afraid of him? I can tell you why. He's the most powerful man in Washington because Bernie Sanders has the people on his side. 
Worst-case scenario they think this is a cover for being a mule.
Actually they have done tons of stuff, all for the betterment of the lives of the American people. Those protections that Trump and his cabinet are trying to rip apart to let credit card companies and banks resume robbing people, those were put in by Warren and Sanders. \n\nSeriously, go do some research. They have done more for you over the years than anyone else in the democratic party. I mean, hell, Sanders even protected the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans and stopped Clinton and her people from passing legislation that would have put a mandatory 10 day waiting period on buying any gun while they ran the background checks via U.S. Mail costing Americans millions every year in extra cost. The Democrats knew the Brady Bill wouldn't stand up to constitutional review the way they wrote it and that the republicans would shoot it down. They didn't want ACTUAL gun reform. They just wanted to "try" so they could get more votes without actually changing anything. \n\nIt was because he blocked the bill 5 times that we got the background check system we have now. The system that has blocked hundreds of thousands of criminals from getting guns and saved us millions of dollars. It's not perfect but it's sure better than snail mail.  
I voted for Jill because I couldn't vote for Sanders. 
She could win if she had Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as VP but there are so few people that the liberals actually approve of at this point in Washington that she has very few choices. Trey Gowdy is defiantly not one of them. He's a sell out. 
They are only losers if they don't change. Being a loser is a lot like not showering for weeks. All you have to do is take some action to wash the stink off. In the same way, all you have to do is take some action in your life to improve it and you won't be a loser any more. As long as you are taking action to make your life better, you're not a loser. 
Yeah, I know how you feel man. I grew up poor in America. Like super-super poor and it's just getting worse here all the time. Everyone is out for themselves and when you get good leaders that would actually change shit for the better they are crushed by a corrupt and greedy establishment. Sometimes I think the only real power is the power of a gun. \n\nHave you considered moving away from people and just living with animals? Start a dog sanctuary on some land out in farm land. You can go to grocery stores and ask them for the dog food that is expired. They can't sell it and if you get a non-profit license (How ever you do that in your nation) you can offer them tax rebates for donating to you. You can raise money online as a non-profit to pay for your own life while you rescue dogs. Just a thought! 
Yes, Clinton won most of the states where the Primaries were closed so only the people who had voted in the previous primaries and were registered as Democrats for a long time could vote but you can't win a presidency by being the most popular kid in your circle of closest friends. She got her ass handed to her because you need people who are NOT democratic party loyalists to vote for you in the general. Bernie Sanders brought in MILLIONS more independent voters than she did. \n\nThe only reason she won the primary was because those voters, who were behind Sanders' reform ideas, not her corporatist same-old same-old agenda, were not allowed to vote in the primary. The DNC knew she couldn't swing the independent vote worth a damn but they would rather lose to Trump than risk President Bernie Sanders making actual change that would raise their taxes and interfere with them taking legal bribes. \n\nThey literally removed hundreds of thousands of people from the primary voter roles just to make sure Clinton won in New York. The primary was rigged and the DNC paved the way for Trump by doing it. 
Where did you get a 15% tax rate increase? That was never going to happen under any president. A flat 15% tax increase would be insane. Seriously, did you read anything about Sanders actual policy ideas or are you just regurgitating bullshit from CNN? A lot of the things said about Sanders was just political hit jobs by people supporting Clinton. \n\nFor Example: http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21692895-health-care-costs-and-high-taxes-would-sink-sanders-economic-plan-vote-what \nMagazines and papers who target the wealthy ran stories like this one who claimed that instituting universal healthcare alone would raise taxes on every American by almost 9%. Of course this is bullshit and here is why. \n\nThe estimation for these plans keeps everything at it's current costs or raises it. If the government is the only source of insurance, they can lower costs and stop the price gouging that is being done in America. We pay more in health care costs than 12 other first world nations combined. 50% more than the next highest one. \n\nWhy? Because unfettered capitalism not only allows, but demands that the companies who produce these services and supplies price gouge the fuck out of us. Under socialized medicine this always stops. It's worked in all our major allies countries, over and over. \n\nIt would stop one of the major avenues for the transfer of wealth from the lower and middle class to the top so the people in power aren't having it. 
It's perfectly fine to talk to her and tell her you just don't feel ready to have a child. You still love her, right? It's the +child that is dragging the whole thing down. Having a kid is practically a death sentence for your life and dreams. It makes everything harder. She might be in love with the idea right now but if she talks to women who have actually raised children she might change her mind. When you become a parent you have to give up almost EVERYTHING to do it right. She might be just as upset about it as you are. Talk with her and see if she really wants the child or if it's just that she thinks you want it so she's doing it for you as a couple. With the economy and the world the way it is today, many people are just not having kids. Act fast if you are going to act. 
How desperate are these people to blame ANYONE BUT HILLARY? \nShe lost because she's a horrible, horrible person, a worse politician and is as likable as a week old corpse. The Russians didn't make Hillary lose, Hillary did that all on her own. America said #BernieOrBust and the DNC chose bust. If you are looking for someone to blame, blame Debbie and the DNC for Trump. 
To paint is the ability to force your will onto reality with the stroke of a brush. Through determination alone you create something from nothing. To paint is to be like unto a God putting forth creation and leaving a legacy that will survive even death. 
Yes.
Sending dick pics to a girl is one of the worst things you can do. Dicks are gross. Unless she is literally begging for it from so far away you can't drive to her, you are just going to lower your value by sending her a dick pic. \n\nYou'd be much better off just telling her that if she wants to see it, she'll have to do it in person. Describe it to her accurately if you want, but don't send pictures and you shouldn't pressure her for nudes either because as nice as they are, getting an early access pass to the real thing is better.  \n\nIf she is even remotely a decent person she'll understand when you say you don't want to end up risking some hacker putting your body all over the internet. You can use this excuse to avoid sending pics to a girl who is close enough to meet up with in person. Once you are both naked together you are already halfway home. \n\nTLDR: Don't give up a great opertunity for sex in exchange for a quick, cheap thrill. If she is close enough to drive too, she's close enough to get nude with. 
People telling you it's ok to feel bad and that your feelings are justified then not telling you how to move past them is not helping someone, it's just encouraging them to wallow in their own self-destructive spiral. Shit is bad all over. Feeling sorry for yourself is fine as long as you are willing to take action to change it. \n\n"Validation" without a plan to move forward is EXACTLY what people do who don't care about you. They'll say your feelings are real and valid and you have every right to feel that way then they will pat you on the back and walk away leaving you to feel like shit. \n\nI'm pretty sure people come here looking for the tools to fix their lives so they don't have to feel suicidal. Otherwise they would have just killed themselves. 
I do too, but he fucked up big time by supporting the dems.
Poor people don't own much, but most of us own guns. I wouldn't worry too much about the poor. I would worry about the cost of the prison system which is going to skyrocket when the crime rates double under Trump. When left with nothing else, people will do whatever it takes to survive. 
>I have no self-initiative, I have no discipline. I can barely do the coursework.\n\nSounds like a important person in your life (Father? Mother?) told you that you would never amount to anything and you believed them. You seem to be conditioned to fail. \n\nFun fact, some parents TRAIN their children to fail because it lets the parents control the children longer. It keeps them in the house, it keeps them from taking risks, it makes them safer and all it costs them is their happiness! It's a tool of control that some parents use, especially mothers. \n\nSee if your parents meet the shitty parent checklist! \n\n1) Your parents reward you when you fail. \n\nExample: Lose your job? Lets get some pizza to make you feel better! You'll have better luck next time! \n\n2) They find reasons for you put off trying.\n\nExample: You should really get a job honey but you'll need some new clothes and to fix the breaks on your car. Let me make an appointment with the garage and we can go shopping next Saturday! \n\n3) They make you feel bad about not being successful then ask you to aim lower and lower as if you are not good enough. \n\nExample: Have trouble finding a job in the field you went to school for? Maybe you should try something you like a little less until a job opens up? No, working that job would be too hard on your back, try something part time! What about part time at McDonalds? Anyone can get hired at McDonalds, even you. \n\n4) Parents that undermine your success to get you to quit. \n\nExample: Being a painter isn't a real job. You should go back to school and get a job in the medical profession! You shouldn't be wasting your time doing art. No one needs art any more! I know it makes you happy but you can't afford to depend on a job where the money isn't reliable.\n\nIf your parents do this kind of thing, you should channel your rage into one goal: GET AWAY!  \n\n
Think of school like a job that pays you in higher wages and better sexual partners after you graduate. College is a full time job. Don't let anyone tell you it's easy, they are lying. Just remind yourself why you are doing it. You don't want to be a dead end loser. You want to be the guy who gets the hot girl and makes all your friends jealous. 
you can't find **any** job or you can't find any job you are willing to do? 
Its not a catch 22 because he could have said, "The Democratic party has failed the American people by choosing Hillary Clinton. No candidate who is sponcered by and works for big business will defeat Trump. We can't win by trying to out-republucan the actual republicans. We must stand for and with the working class."  Then leave the Dems and form a Worker's Party.\n\nThat would have been the right thing to do.
Good news! If you eat healthy and keep yourself in shape you wont die. (Barring an accident) Technology experts predict that the human life span is going to double in most modern societies in the next 50 years and during that time it will double again. So if you are 19 now you are looking at a good 200-350 year life span and because the growth of technology is on an exponential curve that will grow faster than most people today can comprehend once we get true A.I. going, you'll most likely be spending your 110th birthday in space or on mars! Scientists are even working on a way to actually reverse aging and keep you in peek physical condition for ever. It's cheaper than paying for everyone to have health care! \n\nDo some research and you'll find you were born at a GREAT time in human history. You are the alpha test generation for the evolution of humanity into cybernetic life forms. Unlike all previous generations, (like mine) yours literally have little reason to fear death. By the time you are old enough to die we'll be transferring human consciousness into machine bodies. \n\nEnjoy, you lucky bastard! 
Yeah, I had that happen. I was hanging out with a female friend cooking. I had a big pot of boiling pasta in my hands and she was standing in the way to the sink. I said, "Beep! Beep!" like I was a car and she ignored me because she was talking on her phone with her boy friend. I kneed her in the butt cheek and said, "Hot pasta, coming through!" Then finally she moved. \n\nLater on that night she said she felt like I had raped her because I kneed her in the butt and she had to tell her boy friend about it and she didn't understand why he wasn't taking her feelings seriously. \n[](/spikemeh) \n\nNeedless to say, she's single now. \n
Are you dissing Legos?
They are better off with me than with someone who thinks they are a precious little angel. If you realize what they are you know how to best help them become better adults. If you raise your dog as if it's a cat, you're going to have a very unhappy dog. The same is true for children. 
Over 100 children are killed in just accidental shootings, every year, in America. But saving the life of one yoga instructor totally justifies those deaths, right? I'm sure their families would be so thrilled!
> It is possible to reform the Democratic party into something that is actually progressive.\n\nWe'll have to agree to disagree. The dems are blind to what's coming.
Hey, whatever gets him off the couch and into the game. 
> Please point out how her policies were worse than Obama.\n\nThere in lies your problem. You think Obama was a good president. He deported more people than Bush. He sold America to the corporate interests on a daily basis and he did **nothing** to help the working class. He never once fought for a single progressive idea. Even Obamacare was a a way to legally force people to pay insurance companies at the behest of his donors. It was a massive give-away to the 1%. Obama was by no stretch of the imagination a  good president. Why would I vote for someone just like him? 
This is going to happen on it's own. Check this video out it's called "Humans need not apply." https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU \n\nIt's an older video and underestimates how fast things are changing. The unemployment rate is just going to keep climbing and climbing. Jobs are going to be a thing of the past. People are going to have a lot more free time and they are going to spend it trying to find happiness outside of a work environment. The population is going to drop and people will generally speaking, spend more time caring for themselves. Also our life spans will have doubled from what it is today.\n\nTLDR: If you wait another 30 years, your ideal future will be the present. 
It was more that she IS massivly corrupt and wikileaks exposed it. Saying she lost because people dared talk about her corruption is akin to saying that we shouldn't arrest bank robbers if they are nice people. If it wasn't true , it wouldn't have been an issue.
I hear you. I don't have any interest in doing any of them either but I still write, I still help people, I still change the world and when I do I feel better. I have to make myself do them but when I do it's rewarding. \n\nThe real question is: What do you want to do but can't because it's illegal or frowned on by society?
Life is a gift if you are born with wealth and privilege. Most of us are not. We have to take those things by force. 
From what I understand from a friend of mine perusing her masters, once you get your Masters you are much, much more vulnerable to legal action if you say the wrong thing. \n\nA good chunk of psychology training is how **not** to feel actual feelings for your clients or get too involved in their lives. Once you get your masters you suddenly can't say things you would normally like to say because you could get sued for it. 
Don't get me wrong, I love kids, but you can't think of them like they are little people. They are not little people, they are little drama queens with nothing but self interest to guide them. We all start off that way. Some of us grow out of it and some of us just stay brats inside forever. I was just reading an article the other day by a woman who uses the same techniques she uses on her toddlers to help her deal with her husband and they work surprisingly well. \n\nExample: When your husband does something you don't like, nagging him isn't going to change it. Instead say calmly, "Baby, that wasn't really helpful. Next time can we <give him the right way to do it>, please?" then when he does reward him with a treat or a hug and tell him you are proud of him. It will change his behavior overnight. \n\nJust like children, many adults need to feel appreciated. When your spouse comes home, no matter what the day has been like for you, if you act like you have missed them sooooo much and have looked forward to being in their arms again all day long, for the rest of the night the stress from their jobs will be much, much less. \n\nJust like a child they need to know they are missed and wanted. That daily reassurance will do more to stabilize your marriage than you can imagine. It's worked for many of my friends. 
>Bernie raised like 300 million.\n\nThat was before he endorsed $Hillary. As long as he is a democrat the people who backed him against her will never trust him or be inspired by him like they once were. Until he disavows and separates from the corporate whores in the Democratic party he's pretty much done. 
Mock it all you want, but the fact of the matter is, old people die. Young people see the broken system and want no part of it. Old people can get in line and stand with us for making the world a better place or be cast aside as irrelevant fossils of a backwards political ideology. Sanders gets it. He's with us, we're not with him. When he endorsed Clinton to try and stop Trump he lost a lot of followers. Unlike Clinton's people, the next generation of voters vote based on issues and policies not who gets the most endorsements from movie stars. 
When Stewart was there it was a positive but now it's just another mouth price for the establishment. It's corporate owners don't let it offer any real critisism of the "left" and would never call it the Democrats for being the corporate whores they are. 
**LOL**, how can you feel that way about Children? Do you remember what it was like to be a child? Children are greedy, self-centered little cunts with no concept of how their actions effect the people around them. Children aren't innocent, they are mentally impaired. Your brain doesn't reach full functionality until your late teens. Children are literally tiny sociopaths who only care about what they want. That is the reason parenting is so hard. They don't start off as precious little angels, they start off as greedy, little, snot monsters and we TAME THEM to make them into good people. 
If you think middle class people wouldn't willingly pay $200 extra a year so that everyone can go to college for free and have health insurance you're really bad at basic math. Sanders plan would have saved the majority of Americans huge amounts of money but it would have cost the 1% dearly. That is why they cheated to stop him. \n\nWe live in the single most wealthy nation that has ever existed in the history of the earth and over half our population lives below the poverty line. If you think people aren't ready for something other than unfettered capitalism crushing them, you were obviously born into one of the families that are part of the problem. Most of America is one bad day away from economic ruin if not already there. Trump ran on a platform of changing that. He's only making it worse. \n\nBernie Sanders offered a peaceful way to fix the system and the establishment turned it down. The over 60% of America living in poverty are going to turn to violence to fix the country. They have had enough. \n\nYou see Bernie as some old hippy preaching Bluepill ideas but that was our last shot at preventing all out bloodshed. People are awake, angry and well armed in America. \n\nTrump is not prepared for what is about to happen when the Right Wing realizes he is just going to fuck them over like Obama did. \n\nI'd predict the assassination of a governor or congressman by an angry, white, factory worker from the rust belt who lost his job under Obama and voted for Trump to get it back by the end of June. \n\nOnce the first shots are fired, all the crazies are going to come out of the woodwork and it's just going to escalate. Escalation is the only thing Trump understands. \n
Ha, I know a funny story about this because I had the same problem when I was growing up after years of sexual abuse. I learned the secret to sleeping well from a G.I. Joe cartoon episode where Cobra had invaded the minds of the Joes giving them all nightmares. But one of the Joes, Tunnel Rat (I think) he always had nightmares so being trapped in one was nothing new to him. He taught the other Joes how to kick ass in those dreams and defeat cobra in their own minds.  \n\nYou see, in my dream my attacker (Grandfather) would come into my room at night like he did when I was young and make me relive the trauma. It wasn't until I accepted that what he did was wrong, that it was not my fault and I let myself get pissed off about it that the dreams stopped. Once I realized these dreams were because what he did was an attack, an act of evil, I let myself fight back. \n\nOne night he came into my room inside the dream and I finally just let myself be angry at him. I leaped out of the bed and beat the ever living shit out of him! My nightmares stopped after that point for months. Some times they'll come back but they have no power over me now. In fact no nightmare has power over me now. If I start having a dream I don't like, I can just change it. \n\nRemember, it's your dream, your mind and you can do anything you want in it. You have every right to be angry and your dream attacker has made you suffer enough. Fuck them up. 
Some people (Narcissists) become therapists to get their kicks by being looked up to and depended on. They enjoy the suffering of their clients. She sounds like one of them. \n\nJust cancel and then never make another appointment. Don't give her the satisfaction of knowing why you canceled. If she demands to know why, just tell her you found someone better. That drives Narcissists crazy. 
Name me a policy that Clinton had which was more progressive than Sanders.\nI would love to see your source on that.
Yeah, but a nice dream. There are so many better places in life than this world. I think this world lacks hope. There is no magic, no spark, no chance for people to be more than they are born into. All the best fictional worlds have ways you can better yourself that actually make a fucking difference. 
Where are you getting these numbers? There is no reality in which Bernie Sanders was going to levy a flat 27% tax increase. 
Obama won on a platform of being progressive, TWICE in record breaking numbers. He defeated Clinton on a platform of being more progressive than her. \n\nAmerica is STARVING for real progressives. Hell, even TRUMP ran on a platform of "Draining the swamp" and getting rid of corruption in government. Populism has won every election because people want CHANGE the system isn't working for us. \n\nThe democrats are just going to keep losing unless they embrace the left. 
>Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn't all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process.\n\nIt's brilliant thinking like this that lost the democrats the election. This Bill Ivey at Global Cultural Strategies should be a shining example of what not to do for all other consulting firms. It is people like Bill that cost Clinton the election because they convince her not to run on a populist platform.  
It sounds like you have a lot of fear in your life. Do you worry all the time? Think of the worst thing that could possibly happen constantly so you can be prepared for it? If so, that worry could be sucking quality out of your life. \n\nI encourage people to face struggle and fail regularly because if we fear failure then it will always hold us back but when we do fail we learn that failing isn't actually all that bad and more often than not, we achieve our goals. Never trying because you might fail is failing by default. \n\nMost problems in life can be boiled down to fear or need. You fear losing something or you are not getting something you need. Figure out which of those things is motivating you to be miserable and you can start walking the path to change it. 
Not after Sanders endorsed Clinton. She is poison to everything she touches. She fails at everything she does. The only thing she is good at is accepting bribes. Name one actually good thing she did in the last 10 years? 
For someone who doesn't care, you sure do get mighty offended and like to argue. I think you do care, you're just afraid. You're so afraid of failing you don't want to try anything. You're so full of yourself, so self-centered, so greedy and needy that you are are willing to give up **everything** because you want life to be handed too you on a silver platter. Your life is one continuous tantrum because you can't have things **your** way. \n\nWelcome to the real world, cupcake! You gotta earn your happiness. No one is going to give it to you. 
Lots of people will show them empathy, lots of people have shown them empathy int he past and you know what? Life still sucks. Telling people it's going to be ok doesn't change shit. You have to make changes in your own life. You can either be a loser or you can change it. No one is going to fix your life for you and no amount of empathy is going to get you off your ass to do it. \n\nIf you feel like you need to to kill yourself you are objectively a loser at life. You need to change your life right now. \n\nIf I was telling you it's ok and you should take your time to work through your feelings, isn't helping YOU it's helping ME feel better about you feeling depressed. \n\nIf someone is at the point where they are feeling suicidal they need change and they need it RIGHT FUCKING NOW. It's time for ACTION not sympathy or kind words of comfort. If you are suicidal that is life's way of telling you that you need to get your ass off the computer and make things different in your life.  \n\nEmpathy is all fine and good for most situations but suicide isn't one of them. If you are that far down the rabbit hole then you need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and make positive changes in your life. Earn my empathy by not being a loser and I'll give it to you. If you are willing to quit the game of life, you get no reward. 
If you are in a relationship living in a house with parents who try and sabotage your life, you'll find they try and sabotage your relationships too. Moving out ASAP would be a good idea. Take out student loans if you have to get your own place. It's better than living with an abuser. \n
It **should** be the opposite of a true Democrat but sadly this kind of monumental failure is business as usual for the current leadership. They used Super-Delegates to force Clinton on us because they would rather lose to Trump and let America suffer than be fired from their positions of power and lose the money they make. \n\nThey would rather let America burn than elect someone who would actually stop the wealthy from buying politicians so they forced the corporate whore on us and she lost. It had nothing to do with ideology or politics and everything to do with the people in power wanting to keep their jobs. 
That is awesome. But you are the rare case. Most gun owners can't afford a custom bio-safe. If you have all that, you most likely live in a very low crime area where you will never need to use that gun. Most gun owners don't have that luxury.\n\nPS: leaving your living room lights on is statistically far more effective a deterant than owning a gun.
> she actually had a wealth of solid plans for the presidency\n\nYes, and they were all plans that would have screwed the middle class and the poor. Picking Hillary over Sanders is what cost the Democrats the election. We all knew it was going to happen. Literally, factually, on video you can watch it happen, half the DNC convention got up and walked out when she was nominated by the super-delegates. They had to hire people to fill the seats at the DNC convention to cheer for her because she had no real support. \n\nThe DNC is the reason Trump won. 
You sound like a Narcissist. It's OK, we are all born that way. When we are infants we know only our own needs, we know only to scream and cry until we get what we want. It is our mother's job to give us comfort and teach us healthy ways to get what we want. It sounds like your mother dropped the ball big time on that one. \n\nShe sounds like she is emotionally distant and most likely grew up in a home with physical abuse (Father hitting/choking her?) \n\nBecause she failed to make you feel secure and loved as a child you never learned that sharing love is the best way to get it in return. You never got to have the touchy-feely moments that unlock the deeper emotions that most people enjoy. You feel like everyone else has stronger emotions, deeper emotions than you do, and you are correct. \n\nThe bad news is that because this damage is done so early in life it's very difficult to undo. You basically have to learn the language of emotions on your own over the course of your life. \n\nIn the mean time here is a simple guide you can use to navigate life as a Narcissist: \n\nUnderstand that for you, and pretty much everyone else, life is about getting what we need. \n\nMost people can put off this need for periods of time. We call this kindness or generosity but it's basically putting other's needs before our own. You are going to have problems with that. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's something we all have to learn. It takes practice. Your parents are suppose to demonstrate it for you but some parents fail. \n\nBecause you lack the depth of emotions that most people have until you learn them here is a guide to understanding people written by someone who has been in your shoes. Me! \n\nThere are five basic needs that people trade and ask for in return. These are called the Love Languages or The Basic Needs. \n\n=-=-=-=\n1) Practical Love:\n\nGifts with no specific meaning but are just nice things to have, Financial security, holding down a job, being frugal. Working towards the same goal but still being independent of each other. Working together to build a stable future. Slow to change and grow. Not good at sharing emotions or communication so you need someone with patience.\n\n2) Companionship Love:\n\nSharing feelings, talking, cuddling, traveling, exploring together, thinking about the future together. Maximum togetherness, excluding everything else. \n\n3) Emotional Love:\n\nPositive Reinforcement, Supporting each other emotionally, building each other up, standing up for each other when someone puts them down, emotional security and trust. Promises of fidelity and loyalty. \n\n4) Labors of Love:\n\nCooking, cleaning, writing poetry, songs, doing small things through out the day that show in small ways every day how much you love someone. Grand gestures of love, Flowers, carefully chosen gifts that show you know the person well or expensive gifts to spoil your special someone. \n\n5) Physical Love:\n\nSharing physical intimacy, a lack of barriers between people, nudity, sex, showering together, massage, attraction, desire, daring, being exhibitionists.\n\n=-=-=-=\n\nYou have some of these things you want to offer and some of them you want to get in return. So in order to find happiness with people in your life or in relationships, first identify what you are offering then find people who want those things. \n\nI suggest to people that they make a list of the 5 and give each one of the categories a numeric score based on how much of a priority that kind of love is in your life but the scores should always tally up to a total of 10 points. This is called your "Needs List" then make another list of the five and think about the things you have to offer in exchange for your needs. I call this the "Offerings" list. \n\nIt's ok to put zero in a category if you want to. \nExample: If you find the idea of having to work a job to prove you love someone repulsive then put a zero in Practical Love or if you find the idea of talking for hours, sharing your feelings repugnant, then put a zero in Emotional Love. \n\nBy using a total of 10 points you can easily convert the chart into percentages. Example: Your ideal relationship may be 30% Practical love, 10% Companionship, 10% Emotional Love, 20% Labors of Love, 30% Physical Love\n\nIf you know what you need you're better able to find the people who can give it to you. As a Narc it's going to be easier to provide Emotional love than you would think because we so love to study people. We like listening to their problems and the way they become dependent on us. Also many of us become very good at Practical Love because fame and adoration, being recognized for our accomplishments makes us feel very good. It's one of the things our parents never did for us. \n\nOnce you do some research on Narcissism you're going to realize we tend to leave a trail of broken hearts behind us but that is because if you don't understand what your needs are, you are just going to float from person to person trying them on until you get frustrated then you are going to just walk away from them. Once you do, they are done and over with. This can be very damaging to people. So for not only your own happiness but the well being of others, it's important to know what you want and be very, very clear about it from the beginning of your relationships. \n\nHope this helps! \n\nPS: Move away from your mother as soon as possible. She has issues, you have issues because of her issues, as long as you live together it's just always going to be a spiral of negativity in your house. If you are constantly screaming at each other, you can love her better from a distance, trust me. \n\n\n
Clinton's average rally was hundreds of people. Sander's average rally was 10's of thousands of people. Half the democratic party literally left the DNC convention when they nominated Clinton instead of Sanders using the super-delegates. She lost because she could not get turn out. Sanders literally broke records for turn out on almost a weekly basis. \n\nHe totally would have won. It is not even up for debate. If you think otherwise, you are ignorant of the facts. \nDo some research. http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-sanders-would-have-crushed-trump/\n\nSocialist is not a bad word any more. What are you like 50? A balance between capitalism and socialism has helped many nations around the world rise in prosperity at previously unimagined rates. The happiest, healthiest, people on earth live in nations with democratic socialism. \n
We get our cars tuned up, we change the oil and rotate the tires. \nWe go to the gym and run to keep our body and heart in shape.\nWe go to the doctor for check ups and take pills to solve out body's aches. \nWhy do people think going to therapy is any less important as any other regular maintenance? \nOf course you should go, we all need help from time to time. Even therapists go to therapy. 
The problem we have in America is that we are suppose to have two sides of the debate and we don't. \n\nRepublicans are suppose to be the angry anti-government branch of the nation who protects the people from over regulation and strikes down our enemies with righteous vengeance. They are suppose to be our sword. \n\nThe Democrats were suppose to advocate for larger government that takes care of the people here at home and meets the needs of the citizens. They are suppose to struggle for peace not war. They are suppose to be our non-violent shield.\n\nThe problems in America are because the Republicans have become whole-hearted supporters of HUGE WASTEFUL government that are waging more wars than we can keep track of, HUGE banks and corporations that are doing more damage to the American people than any terrorist ever could and the Democrats are doing the exact same thing. Both parties have lost sight of why we needed them so a third party is rising: The party of Anarchy. \n\nThe sword isn't fighting for us and the shield isn't protecting us, until they return to fulfilling their roles, the people are just going to keep rioting and destroying things. Without solid, constructive leadership the population will turn on the 1%, the banks and the corporations in ever more violent ways. \n\nAs long as Washington does nothing useful, the people will do it themselves. 
If one candidate gets 50,000 people to appear at his largest rally and tens of thousands on a regular basis while the other candidate gets 2000 people at her biggest rally, nominate with the one who people actually showed up for? \n\nHow is this hard? \n\nAlso, between elections actually fight for the rights of people not corporations. That would have helped a lot. \nSee: Standing Rock that is happening right now... still... and Obama has done NOTHING. 
> If life is consistently a net negative, what can one do but resent it?\n\nChange the world. Write a book, lead a march, do something illegal and stupid, just don't do nothing. Nothing is the worst thing you can do. 
Totally forgot about that, good point there.
If someone is hurting themselves through action or inaction it is our duty as decent human beings to tell them to cut that shit out. Validating them wallowing in their own misery isn't helpful. It's enabling them to be a loser. If someone is acting like a loser I'm going to tell them as much. All you have to do is try. It's not difficult or complex. Pick something good and do it until it works. Don't be a loser. 
You would need to make an appointment to fuck my mom. She's usually booked through the week.  \n\nIn all seriousness though, if there is really, nothing, absolutely nothing you want to do for yourself then why not join the army? \n\nYou don't want to die but you have nothing to live for, so why not live for your nation and your people? live or die bringing justice to the world? Make the world a better place for other people and maybe they'll make it a better place for you? 
Have you ever considered just walking away from your life? Take a backpack, load it with clothes (3 outfits, summer and two winter) a coat and sleeping bag then just walk away from your life. Take out as much cash as you can, drive your car till it runs out of gas then leave it on the side of the road. Be a missing person for a while until you find yourself. Nothing wrong with it. \n\nOh, and get a short hair cut before you leave. You don't want to look like a wookie by the time you get back. 
so, wait, you think the thing they are looking for when they come to this thread is someone to tell them, "Yes, you do feel depressed, you're in the right place." ???? Yes, they are OBVIOUSLY depressed and they OBVIOUSLY feel bad that is why they are posting. They don't need someone to tell them the OBVIOUS they need someone to tell them how to CHANGE IT. 
> Hillary's campaign was fine other than her getting sick.\n\nIf you think that is true you're grossly under informed. 
You want to kill yourself and no one is going to talk you out of it? Fine, be a loser at the game of life, but the very least you could do is use your death for something good. \n\nJust killing yourself is so lame. Go to the middle east and join the civilians fighting ISIS or join the military. Do something with your death don't just waste it on a selfish act of self-pity. Make your death mean something. Change the world. 
Try the "Three Things" rule. I made it up, it works for me. Do three adult, responsible things a day then give yourself permission to fuck off the rest of the day and be a slacker. This way the day is never too overwhelming and is never so large a mountain to climb that it doesn't seem like doing it is worth it.  
1) Talk less. You talk a lot. You share too much. More mystery, less history! \n\n2) Talk about other people's problems not your own. If you have time to take care of them then they will assume you have your own shit together. \n\n3) Be positive. People assume if you are looking on the bright side of things then you must be doing ok. \n\n4) Dress well, be well groomed. If you look slovenly then people will assume you have problems. \n\n5) Spend money on your friends. You don't have to spend a lot but take people out to eat from time to time just to catch up with them or buy them nice birthday presents. If you are willing and able to spend money on them they will assume your finances are together. \n\n6) Maintain your car. It's a sign of a person with their life in order if they keep a stable, working car. It doesn't need to be a great car as long as it is working and clean. \n\n7) Go to a gym. It would do your self esteem a great deal of good to go to a gym. You seem to think you need it. \n\n8) This is the most important rule and the most difficult to master: BE AWESOME. Do something every day to make yourself a better person. Don't brag about it, don't make it a big deal, just do it. Not for anyone else's approval but because it makes you a better you. Whether it's going to the gym, reading a book, watching a Ted Talk or practicing some hobby, just do something cool for yourself every day. Build your awesomeness because when you love yourself, everyone else will want to be around you. \n\nPS: Grammar. It doesn't have to be perfect but if you don't try you look lazy. 
I got my first job at 14. I ran track, I saved up and got my own car and when I turned 18, my own apartment. You don't have to be over 25 to have the things women want but if you are only interested in high school chubbies with low self-esteem then posture and attitude will get you far enough, I guess... \n\nMe, I wanted best. I worked for it, and I got it because that is what being Alpha really is.
You can eat the wealthy. ;)
2016 was the year that liberals had a candidate they rallied behind like never before in history... then the DNC stole the nomination from him and the voters chose not to vote rather than vote for Hillary. \n\nTrump didn't win because America is racist. Clinton lost because no one wanted to come out and vote for a warmongering, corporate puppet.
Sanders gets all kinds of shit done. He joined the Democratic party, ignited the fire in an entire generation who otherwise knew nothing about politics and battles a corporate whore to a stand still in the Primary. The only reason she won was because they used Super-Delegates to pick her. Establishment politicians who are part of the 1% that were afraid that Sanders would make them pay taxes instead of getting tax rebates. They choose to lose to Trump rather than lose their jobs and have to pay taxes. \n\nLiterally, when they announced that Hillary had won half the democratic party got up and walked out of the DNC convention to protest outside. Clinton's people had to pay actors to fill up the seats and cheer for her because half the building left when they cheated for her. \n\nBernie Sanders and his movement is the future. Like it or not, the revolution is happening. 
Fuck the old democrats. They are over. I'm just waiting for Sanders to realize it and join JusticeDemocrats. 
Ah, so that enter, etc. is consistent with one location on screen while clicking just uses whichever one you click?
Wow, I missed that part of the whole paid mods fiasco. So glad we didn't ultimately end up becoming like the Minecraft modding community
>Higher minimum wages\n\nWhich she only adopted because of Sanders, and then tried to limit to $12 an hour instead of $15. So pretty much the opposite of progressive. \n\n>Free community colleges.\n\nYeah, no. Her plan was to make colleges more affordable, not free for most Americans and again, she was saying nothing about it till Sanders. \n\n>Holding taxes steady for the lower and middle classes while raising them on the top 5%\n\nAgain, Sander's polices except that he would have raised taxes on the middle class a few dollars to pay for universal healthcare, the thing she says is impossible. \n\n>Paid parental leave\n\nSander's policy.\n\n>Public healthcare option\n\nYou didn't do your research did you? Clinton had this to say about the public option: "People who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass."\n\nShe only supported it late in the primary when she saw she was losing to Sanders because he actually wanted to DO things not just keep the broken system we have now. That is why the DNC had to cheat it's ass off for her. She was the candidate of "Meh, it's good enough" when people need REAL change. \n\nHer only political skill is taking credit for other people's work. \n
Sorry, my bad. You said that as if you wew talking about an actual progressive not Obama the neo liberal corporate whore.
> She got Iran to give up their nuclear weapons program.\n\nKerry did that. \n>She worked to expand health care for all Americans\n\nObama did that and it is failing as we speak. \n\n>She has worked to advance women's rights by creating an Office of Global Women's Issues.\n\nAgain, Obama did that. She just took credit for it. \n\n>She founded a charity that has helped countless people all over the world.\n\nYes, she did found a charity and if it wasn't a GIANT money laundering scheme for her corruption I would give her credit for that but only a small percentage of the foundation money ever goes to help anyone, it's mostly used to pay her friends and line her pockets. \n\nPS: The Clintons were members of a Whites-Only golf club until 1992 when the media exposed them. Soooo, yeah Trump is racist but so are the Clintons. \n\nThe only thing Hillary Clinton was ever good at was taking credit for other people's work and that is one of the many reasons she lost. She's fake. \n\n
This dumb fuck voted for Jill Stein who is as charismatic as a plank of wood so your theory is bullshit. Clinton was a corrupt, corporate whore who would sell her own children if the money was good enough and that is why she lost. It wasn't her personality, it was her lack of character and horrible policies. 
>He is breaking the left. They can't deal with him; nothing they do hurts him. \n\nPlease don't call Democrats the Left or Liberals or anything but Democrats. They are a party of corporate whores sucking the knob of any one willing to donate to them. They are stumped by Trump because he doesn't play by the normal rules and they don't know how to handle it. \n\nOn the ACTUAL left, Bernie Sanders and his people are handling Trump quite well. When Trump chose nto to reopen the White House phone lines because so many people were complaining about the pipelines, Bernie Sanders and his people set up a phone bank page where you can go to lodge a complaint about Trump's policies with a random business Trump owns instead. Sanders is hitting him where it hurts: His wallet. https://whitehouseinc.org/\n\nMeanwhile the actual left has organized Justice Democrats with enough candidates to primary every corporate democrat out of office three times over. https://justicedemocrats.com/\n\nThe real left is coming for the corporate democrats. Don't count us as part of those spineless wusses, please. \n\nPS: Trump only won because they ran Clinton against him. Most of Americans didn't vote because it was a choice between the second and the most hated political figures in America. They were both horrible. \n\nTrump promised America jobs, Clinton promised to have a vagina and not to be Trump. \n\nIt's no surprise Trump won. 
I've found that "acceptance" is kind of a lazy therapist answer to the problem of socially unacceptable fetishes. It's like saying "Yes, you're fat. You should just accept it" instead of asking why it is you might be over eating. Once you figure out why you have this fetish you might be able to move past it. Often sexual fetishes are the minds way of making you deal with some issue you that you don't want to deal with. After all, sex is one of the most powerful motivators a human can have, if your mind links that to some issue that your subconscious needs you to deal with, you are going to deal with it sooner or later. \n\nThink of it like your brain blackmailing you into dealing with your shit. Figure out what your brain wants, why did you develop this fetish in the first place and you'll have a good place to start curing yourself of it. 
Awww, did I trigger you? News flash: Changing your life is simple. You start making changes and you keep doing it until things are better. You don't have to enjoy it, you don't even have to do something that works all that well, you just have to take action. Action brings change, wallowing in your misery doesn't bring change. 
Yet, you are still avoiding the question of identifying one actually liberal policy that Clinton had. 
Have you ever faced any actual struggle in your entire life? Your depression could be because you were so protected you were never given a chance to be self-sufficient. We are suppose to have a certain progression of independence when we are children. We are given more and more freedom as we grow up. Three-wheelers to drive around the house as toddlers, bikes to ride around the block as children, 10 speeds to ride around the hood as kids, cars to drive around as adults. If you come from an overly wealthy family or a family that lives in such a bad neighborhood that you aren't allowed to explore, this can cause a hitch in your development. If your family was too afraid to let you out of your yard then what you may be suffering from is an insecurity because you were never allowed to take care of yourself. \n\nTry going camping on your own or with a few close friends just to have fun. Go fishing. Motorcycle riding is a blast! Do something you think you might not be good at, outside where you're not protected. Prove to yourself that you can take care of yourself. See if that changes your mood. 
Not just right-wingers, they've also drawn my conservative-leaning moderate friends into their web of idiocy.
Cut it out.
Did someone miss his nap today? \n\nLook, I get it. You want hope and wishful thinking to magically transform your dull life into something exciting but it's not going to. Posture and attitude are great, but as long as you are an out-of-shape slob with no job, no decent ride, no decent phone and no financial security the only women you are going to attract are the worst kind of broken, used goods. \n\nYou have to do the WORK of being Alpha, it isn't a state of mind you can just wish into being, it's a life choice you work at every fucking day. \n\n[](/swagintosh) 
Dreams are tricky things. Where you are at in the dream may be important. Was the dream set in your past? In your present? Was he the kind of person you could just talk to for hours when you were closer in the past? Do you have a friend like that now? Maybe he represents something you left behind that you want to recapture? If it's never sexual in your dreams it may be that he represents a missed opertunity? Do you feel like life is passing you by? Do you feel like you are under appreciated at work? Do you long for someone to recognize you for your contributions? He could represent these things. Someone who will see you for who you are, not look past you. 
Your mistake in this plan is talking. Let the girl talk. Women will talk about themselves all night long. Instead of talking, let her talk while you listen. Offer as little as possible of yourself but always be focused on her and engaged. This feeds her narcissistic supply (Which everyone likes) and it leaves you a mystery. Give her only the bare bone facts on the first date. Single, working, own a house or renting, what kind of car you drive, what kind of relationship are you looking for, those kind of things. Don't talk about yourself unless she asks. The less she knows, the more she'll fantasize about. \n\nFor the second date, I agree having plans is good but don't make them too soon. Give her a few days to think about you and want you before you go on the second date. I usually do 4 days later then call her on day 3 and talk on the phone as if I just couldn't wait. It makes her feel special and that is what you want. You want her to feel like if she is yours, she is the center of your world.  
This is pretty standard for therapists. A lot of people can write or even type out feelings that they can never express verbally. It makes it somehow less real when you type it out on a computer rather than saying it with your own words. It gives you a level of emotional separation that you can't get when it's coming out of your own mouth. \n\nMy advice? Write it all down on a word document then read over it all in detail then write a simpler version you would feel more comfortable sharing with your therapist with less details in it. If you write the detailed draft for yourself, knowing that no one else will ever see it then you can at least move it outside of yourself where you can look at it more objectively and find the parts you *do* want to talk with the therapist about more easily. \n\nYou'd be surprised at how much it helps just having it outside of yourself. Many pagan/tribal traditions had rituals where victims of assault would write the crime down then lock it in a box or seal it in a bound jar. Slowly over time the jar would leach away the pain and when the survivor felt ready they would bury the jar in the earth forever. There was an almost universally recognized value to having your pain moved "outside" of yourself where you can deal with it in some physical form then, eventually, let it go. 
You're right, I know and care nothing about you as an individual.  I wasn't talking about you or your life. I was talking about children in general but this post wasn't about you. Not everything is about you. You would probably have more friends if you stopped trying to make everything about you. 
they can't be reasoned with. They will have to come to the conclusion on their own. The great thing about the democratic party is that all they know how to do is lose. They will just keep voting for Trump's failed policies over and over and the public will see how they are paid to lose. The future of democracy is neither the Dems or the Republicans. It's time to burn this shit down and build a Worker's Party that actually gets shit done for the citizens not the oligarchy. 
First off, don't feel bad. This is a very common problem to have so there is lots of research that can be done on it. You can get past it pretty easily once you identify the source. \n\nTraditionally, dreams about being unable to stand up or being held down represent one of a few things I'll list them below. See if any of them apply to your life. \n\n1) Unfulfilled passions:\n\nYou are stuck in a life you don't actually want. Forced to do a job you never wanted, in a field you never wanted to be in but were forced into because it was easy or profitable but it takes up all your time so you never have a chance to follow your passions even in your spare time. \n\n2) Someone is holding you back: \n\nThere may be someone in your life, a parent, a boy/girl friend, a sibling, a teacher or even a counselor who is holding you back from what you really, really need to do. You know they only mean well for you and you feel paralyzing guilt for feeling angry at them. You feel they are holding you back in some important way. Many parents actually feel this way about their children in the early years of life. It's perfectly natural. \n\nWe need what we need, ask yourself if the people holding you back are doing so for reasonable, logical, reasons or are they just holding you back for their own selfish reasons? You might be angry at them and not want to allow yourself to feel that way so you downward spiral until you just don't want to do anything. \n\n3) Dead Weight: \n\nSome times you have friends who frustrate you to no end. Like a girl who you really want to be more than friends with but she has you firmly in the friend zone. You are never going to have the relationship you want but you also like being around her so you just suffer in silence to keep her happy. Perhaps you have a friend or family member who does too many drugs and is always dragging you along when they get you into trouble? An Ex that just stays in your life to keep you on the line giving you hope that one day thing will get better as long as you do them favors? People like these are emotional weights on your life. Cut off all contact with them and move on. \n\nIf you are not getting what you need from the relationship, then dump them. Friendships are no different than dating. If it's not working out for you, don't try and force it. Find someone better for you and let them find someone better for them. Otherwise you are doing both a disservice. \n\n4) You need recognition for your work: \n\nSome times we feel like everyone just takes and takes and takes from us until we have nothing left. You work your ass off for people and they never show you any appreciation. If this goes on long enough, you'll just collapse in on yourself feeling hollow and worthless. Again, if you have people in your life who are just using you and refuse to give you even basic recognition of your contributions cut them out of your life and find a better class of friends. \n\n5) Too much floating: \n\nSome drugs can cause this kind of sensation as well. DXM I think it's called? Robotripping? While you are not high you can feel this way. It's a neurological response. There are some funny videos I've seen of people trying to walk but literally being unable too. They felt like they were melting or something. Good news is that it's just a sign of over use. You can scale back for a week and see if that causes the sensation to stop. \n\n6) Heart problems: \n\nThis can be a sign of heart problems. Weakened valves or an unstable rhythm that can be exasperated while asleep. If you often lay down before bed and hear your heart beating very loudly it could be that you need to go see a doctor about a weak heart. Good news is, it's easily fixed with diet and exercise in most cases if you are still young and not a lot of damage has been done. \n\nAny of these ring a bell for you?  
If you don't like your life, change it, make it better. That's what the rest of us do. 
At 13 everything seems overwhelming and epic. If he's abusing you, pack your shit and leave. Walk out of the door with a change of clothes, snacks and water. Steal any cash you can get your hands on. \n\nWhen the cops find you, and they will, tell them he's been hitting you and you'd rather be in Juvie than live with him. If they threaten to take you back home, apologize to the cop first then kick him in the shin and get arrested. Worked for me. \n\nIf your parent is an asshole and one of you has to suffer because of it, then you might as well make it HIM not you. 
It wasn't Clinton specifically. She was just the figurehead for a way of doing government that people are sick of. Corporatist government has to die for America to survive. \n\nEveryone knows that the system is broken. It's just not sustainable. It's going to collapse. 1% of the population of America controls over half the wealth and value. They will just have to pay taxes because they literally have almost all the money. Clinton and her neo-liberal friends are all about keeping the wealthy rich and the poor starving. \n\nReal progressives didn't come out to vote for her because we knew it was going to be more of the same. 
Actually, that is what the 1st is for. She can yell "Fuck white people!" all she wants in America just like we can yell whatever we want. Yelling crazy ideas back and forth at each other is the very foundation that grew into government and society. We don't outlaw bad thoughts in America... yet. 
To add on to this, the Headmaster (the only allied character shown to be aware of the [spoiler](time loop) save for Jane) stated that he is strong enough to be aware of it, but not strong enough to change events.  So Fogg can't really be more helpful, probably can't rally the rest of the staff, etc. No one else knows the scope of the problem, and the main characters seem much more inclined to steal information and cobble together desperate rituals than ask for help.
December 31, 1969
I work a minimum wage job, 29 hours a week, spend my time painting and writing, thinking about the future and how I want to change it to make the world a better place, going to political rallies and hanging out with my friends. I phone banked for Bernie for a while. It's all good stuff. It's not the amount of money you have that makes you happy, it's what you are doing with it. \n\nIf you want to leave a mark on the world, do something good with the money. Go to your local middle school, talk to the guidance councilor or principle, ask about a poor family who has a smart kid that will not have a chance to go to a good college. Ask the school to arrange a meeting. \n\nTalk with the parents and ask them if they would like you to set up a college savings bond for their child so when their kid is old enough, the bond will cash out and they can have it to help pay for college. Put that money in the bank for them and let it accrue interest while the kid is in school. \n\nThis way the children you help become your legacy and the changes they make in the future are also changes that you made possible. 
> kingdom system similar to Warband **or Skyrim**\n\nI love Skyrim, but what is this kingdom system of which you speak?
No, the megachurches have been like this for a while.
Have you tried it with the Overload demo?
No, the megachurches and televangelists have been like this for a while.

Somehow my brain almost completely ignores the co-op part of the question. But yeah, while Transistor isn't purely turn based, the Turn() function lets you plan stuff out (and then you spend the next few seconds until it recharges running away). Not quite ideal.\n\nOoh. Totally forgot about this one, but Wakfu is a turn-based MMO. You could either play on separate accounts in a party, or get a sidekick and have one of you control them.
So, no comment on Yogic Flying?

Yeah, probably not eliminate it entirely. I like your description of sidestepping issues the judiciary doesn't want to deal with. Of all the branches to not be power-hungry, it's the one we want to be.
Yeah, I expected it would be innocuous. Just so you know, neonazis also use them to label people as jewish without saying so explicitly.
You rang?
Definitely the unofficial patch, fixes a bunch of bugs. Also pick up the Modern Brawl Bug Fix, maybe Cutting Room Floor if you want. Probably save perk overhauls and spell mods for a little bit later. Pick up Alternate Start: Live Another Life now, you'll thank me later (it doesn't stop you from playing the Main Quest) If you aren't modding too much, Open Cities Skyrim is great and does what it says on the tin.\n\nOnce you get used to iNeed and Frostfall they won't get in the way too much, but for your first few playthroughs I wouldn't touch them.\n\nOh, pick up a mod that disables kill cams once they start getting annoying (they will, I promise you).\n\nLast mod I'd consider relatively essential is the dll mod that enables achievements on modded saves--no idea why Bethesda disabled those.\n\nPast this point, everything pretty much comes down to taste and what sorts of characters you want to play. If you find that bad textures annoy you (or want a change), get a mod to improve it. Same for meshes, audio overhauls, etc. If you can't tell the difference or it doesn't bug you, you don't need it.
Oh, look. A judge. Fully retractable for the next time voting comes up, though. 
Apparently you have to do the quest and time stuff right and obey a strict morality code.\n\n Probably a matter of taste, but the whole thing just is a bit too on-the-nose for me. The bonuses, etc. seem more like what a lay worshipper of the Imperial Cult might think of the divines than anything else. And other aspects are a bit too gamey. The divines don't care whether you steal or are a criminal, they care whether you have a _bounty_ or not?
SE, I disabled all mods except the ones that should effect Campfire
Yes. Zephyr Prime.
But...they're not generalizing white people. They aren't generalizing poor people. They aren't even generalizing poor white people. They're saying that if you can convince a poor white person (these categories are useful here only in the context of this particular culture, they aren't generalizing the group as a whole) that they're superior by virtue of race, you can exploit them while directing their anger towards other people.
Everyone agrees Antifa is terrible. The ACLU can't do anything about them, that's the job of the police.

Yeah,  found them all through the SE campfire requirements link on the nexus. (Also because NMM throws up warnings whenever I try to download Oldrim mods through it, compatible or not). But they could have been improperly converted.\n\nEdit: that being said, on the SE discussion pages for all of them people talk about them working, so I think it's one or more of them interfering with each other.

Transistor isn't completely turn-based, but it has a turn ability that temporarily makes it so, and you can orient your build around that.\n\nAtlas reactor was already mentioned, and is multiplayer.\n\nX-Com EU's dash cam can be turned off.\n\nIn a different vein, Nethack and Slashem are free on PC (there's an isometric viewer) and are very D&D-like.\n\nDwarf Fortress takes a bit to get into, but it might be up her alley.\n\n The Civilization series is all turn based, and if you both like it you'll waste days playing it together.

Stupid question: can you mount a creature that is already mounted? Like, make the follower mount the player instead of the horse?
Modders were sabotaging each other due to drama, etc. Imagine if Ordinator had a script that crashes the game if Path of Sorcery is installed over it, that's what happened.
As far as I can tell, no, they would not. Pretty sure they're fine with the Warren v. District of Columbia ruling.\n\nLet's say we have a directly analogous situation: Obama has a sudden fit of idiocy and decides to give a speech in an ultra conservative university known for protests with a local KKK presence. There are peaceful protests before he gets there, and the KKK shows up to attack his supporters, shoot fireworks at buildings, pepper-spray young women in the face, etc. Questions of police complacency are raised. Aside from maybe a dubious equal protection clause argument, I can't see the ACLU doing anything in either case 
Is it? I thought they were just joking
To me, fanfiction invokes a distinctly different culture, purpose of writing, and expected quality. Sure apocrypha fits the broader definition, but my expectations for Elder Scrolls apocrypha are entirely different than my expectations for Elder Scrolls fanfiction.\n\nI expect these things out of fanfiction: Writing quality ranging from poor to decent. Unfinished stories. Power fantasies. Romance fantasies. Poor character interpretation. 'Worldbuilding' as an excuse for the above power fantasies.\n\nThere's a class of fanfiction that goes beyond these expectations (more of a spectrum really), but my automatic reaction when you mention fanfiction is to think of the trashiest pieces I won't ever, ever admit to reading.\n\nMy expectations for Apocrypha are higher than my expectations for most fanfiction, and _different_ than my expectations for the good fanfiction. It's almost 4 in the morning and I'm having trouble finding words, but Apocrypha tends to have a very distinct aesthetic to it that I haven't seen in fanfiction (or most published fiction, for that matter). 
Also lies
Hey! Don't you dare call them that, that's an insult to grifters!
So, I broke campfire and I'm not sure how. No apparent conflicts in SSEdit, I just can't place items. I have hearthcraft, necromancer camp, camping essentials, and jmr camp storage installed. Pretty sure one of these broke it, I'm just not sure how.
How do you not know how to do this? There's a tutorial
What I've heard is that Transistor basically inverts what it does well relative to Bastion. Where Bastion is upfront, in Transistor you understand the story through all the little side things you find. Where Bastion's combat is wide but shallow, Transistor's is narrow and deep.\n\nHaven't played Bastion, so I can't tell you if that's true. But I am definitely enjoying my first playthrough of Transistor. It's the sort of game  where I knew in the first five minutes that it was worth the price to me.
Yeah, this probably should only apply to political appointees and elected officials.
Are there videos of this woman and horse? For science, of course.
Have you considered making this yourself? It's a pretty good first mod someone learning the creation kit, if you have the time. Make the ConstructibleObjects (recipes) according to your own standards, make a custom item creation workbench with Enchanting as the relevant skill, make it portable the way Frostfall does it. (heck, you could attach the OnEquip() script to rolls of paper so you can enchant from the inventory), and you're golden.\n\nCan't remember how to do portable workbenches at the moment, but there was a post the other day in this sub about how to do so.
You jest, but somehow I did this. Can't download updates or run Warf Rame.
 Good fuck, Trump
No, there's an alternate start option that's just the vanilla start. Otherwise, it entirely depends on whete you start--if you choose a Winterhold or Windhelm start then you'll have to trek across Skyrim (you can hire a carriage for a pittance though), but some other starts can actually place you closer than the default start does. Definitely do the vanilla start for your first game though.
Nah. Personally I'd still expect the cases of widely reported allegations to be true more than half the time (obviously contingent on how you define widely). But this could definitely help explain the belief that fraudulent allegations are common.
Lo! Glorious day
PCMR was a deliberate reappropriation of the term.

Stuff like this is why I support private prosecution and a long hard look at how incredibly narrow legal standing has become.
Neither do I. Hills are for sliding down, not dying on.
Holy shit I just looked at his history. 
it was a joke :(
Fanfiction *isn't a neutral term anymore*. In a purely literal sense it is, but there is a distinct culture that has evolved under the label of fanfiction which contains large numbers of young, amateur authors. You can also use it as a broader term, but that doesn't mean the connotations suddenly go away.\n\nNo, that's why I italicized _different_ rather than saying the writing is _better_. There are certain subtle genre and aesthetic conventions that make it a useful distinction.
Let me play Devil's advocate for a moment here. The relevant stat to use as a heuristic for who to boo is not how often these claims are true, but rather how often _the subset that generates media attention and outrage_ are true. I wouldn't be surprised if false discrimination claims are overrepresented by the news simply because of the media's bias towards sensationalism.
Sorry, I meant Family friendly.
I strongly disagree here. The unique threat that Trump poses supersedes any code of professionalism, and should regardless of party.
I thought it was subreddit simulator and skipped over it.
Can confirm.
You're saying that as if the majority of the country actually supports Trump.  The majority of the US (both its civilians and government leaders) want to maintain a good relationship with Europe.  His stances aren't without controversy here, even among his own voters.
Not only that, but those boots have eyelets made out of jean rivets.  \n\nOP bought boots made of scrap parts.
Or flying to the US
I'm not blaming children for anything, though.  I'm blaming the ignorant, misinformed Trump voters.  Children are always innocent in matters of state.  That doesn't mean that we can't look back at this shitshow and say, "this person wouldn't be president had it not been for the people that made a conscious decision to vote for him."
Trading partner ≠ ally.\n\nAlly is a very specific term.  The US and Europe are allies.  China and Europe are not.

We're still waiting.
US and Mexican presidents tear a portion of the wall down and shake hands across the border.  This is some potential PR gold!
People had a choice.  They are only responsible for the choices they make.  If that choice was to vote for Donald Trump, they absolutely deserve this bullshit.  They are obsessed with personal responsibility, right?  Stop blaming it on other people and own up to the fact that they consciously walked into a voting booth and chose this clown.\n\nI was a Bernie supporter.  I did not like Hillary one bit, and I still don't.  But I saw that she was the better choice in what we were given.  I'm not going to obsess over whether or not Bernie would have won.  Unfortunately he didn't get that far, and yes the DNC is partially to blame for it.  But ultimately it is the fault of the people that, through all the bullshit, still chose to put a check by Donald Trump's name.
Otherwise he'd be breaking the law under UCMJ.  Our military and our politics are seperate.  This is why you don't see the Joint Chiefs clap or react in anyway during State of the Union addresses.
Thanks.  I'll go take my Centrum Silver now.
Why are you so mad Bront
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it will last a lot longer than the 1-8 years Trump is President.  You guys are giving him far more credit than he deserves.

They could even go into the industry that "took their jerbs" if they became electricians.  You have to start out low as an apprentice, but what the fuck else are these guys doing?  College isn't for everyone and the trades will always be there.\n\nMy brother is a truck driver.  I keep telling him to go into a trade.  Be it plumbing, welding, electrical, or HVAC, those jobs will be there for a long long time AND will pay better.  Truck driving will be gone, and soon.
> People take their word over ACTUAL scientists\n\nI mean, do they?

I've found when I sear a steak it isn't the oil that is reaching a smoke point, but the bits of meat, fat, and seasonings burning on the surface of the pan that are smoking.\n\nI was referring to taking a pan, putting oil in it and heating it past its smoke point before you start cooking.
Being a genius has nothing to do with it.  I know actual geniuses that don't know shit about political issues.  They have opinions, sure.  But they don't know shit.\n\nIt's being informed versus being ignorant and misinformed.

If you are waiting for your fats to smoke before you start cooking in them, you're doing it wrong.  You're not seasoning a pan here, you're cooking in it.\n\nOlive/vegetable oils:  Tilt the pan and run the oil from one side to the other.  If you see striations, the oil is ready.  You will see it start to shimmer in the pan around this time as well.  Same goes for vegetable shortening and animal fats after they have fully melted.\n\nButter:  When the butter is fully melted and just starts to bubble.  Butter will reach its smoke point quickly because of the delicate milk fats within.  Butter tastes absolutely foul when it starts to smoke.  It's best to just toss it if you've reached this point.  Also with butter, keep tossing it around in the pan to melt.  Nothing melts butter like melted butter.  The faster you get that butter completely melted, the better.\n\nIf you're smoking your oils/fats, you're getting bitterness.   So like, stop doing that.
When you think about it, it makes sense.  The military is supposed to follow the orders of the President.  The Joint Chiefs will give the President their opinions, and those discussions may get heated.  But it's never public.  If it were public, then you risk inching towards coup/junta territory with impressionable junior officers and enlisted men and women who may not have the full picture.  Not saying it would happen, just that there are reasons for these rules.\n\nThe military only functions efficiently if orders are followed without delay.  It keeps the gears lubed.  From your oath, to basic training, and throughout your career this instilled in you.  That said, you are also taught that you should not follow unlawful orders and that you would be accountable if you do.  In the back of every military member's mind is that you took an Oath to the Constitution, not to the President.  So it isn't just blindly following the President.
Not everyone in those states voted for this.  I'm all about saying fuck Trump voters, but as a hardcore liberal that enjoys the mountains of Tennessee with other hardcore liberals, this is fucked up.
No it isn't. The sweet spot is lower to compensate for the parallax caused by the image being projected at an angle
> You can mention his color, but not Obamas? Strange.\n\nI'm going to assume you're just trolling, but just in case you aren't and you have actual developmental issues, I'll explain it for you.\n\nObama is brown because he has African ancestry and was born that way.  Trump is orange because he is vain and chose to spray paint himself that color.  It is inappropriate to judge someone based on their race.  It is fine to judge someone that convinced themselves that orange is a natural skintone.\n
Pretty pretty pretty....pretty good\n
I was having issues also.  I opened a ticket and they did something on the backend.  It seems like it may have fixed it, but it was so random before I'm not certain, so I haven't closed my ticket yet.  But contact support if you haven't already, because there may be a bigger issue that needs to be remedied.\n\nI have a Nexus 5x, and contacts were both on iPhones with AT&T.  I'm not certain, but it seemed to affect me when I was on T-Mobile towers.  Not for sure, though.
As a person that grew up in a rural area in a red state, there is absolutely a hive mind in Trump areas as well.  More so even.
Cook in olive oil (not EVOO, but regular old olive oil) and finish and baste with butter.\n\nRegular olive oil will be cheaper and will be a blend of virgin olive oil and refined olive oil.  It has a less intense flavor, but it has a slightly higher smoke point.  Save your good (and expensive) Extra-Virgin Olive Oils for things like dressings where the full flavor will shine.  It's also would be good for quick sautes of things that won't take long to cook like seafood.\n\nThat is what I do, but I'm no means a professional chef.  Others may have better advice.
Tell me how voter ID prevents mail-in ballot fraud. I'll be waiting.\n\nThere isn't a long history of people being bussed in to commit voter fraud.  That is an urban myth.  If you would step out of your bubble you would know that friend.\n\nI'm not afraid to investigate anything.  Voter fraud has been proven time and time again to not occur on any scale in which it effects change.  Since 2000, there were 10 cases of voter impersonation (what the Voter ID laws were drafted to supposedly prevent).  Out of the billions of votes since 2000, there were only 2,106 cases of fraud TOTAL.\n\nWhen talking about fraud, you must think about it in scale.  Are the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on Voter IDs worth it to prevent 2000 cases of fraud in 16 years of voting?  Conservatives are supposed to be small government, right?  This has big, intrusive government written all over it.  It is literally preventing eligible voters from casting a ballot.  
>Also I'm pretty sure Wozniak was the engineer who did the designing and Jobs was just a salesman.\n\nNo, Jobs was an idea man, just like Musk.  It's not taking away from Elon.  I'm not comparing their personalities.  Elon seems to be a pretty cool guy and Steve Jobs was a noted douchebag.  Also Elon is far more technically competent than Jobs ever was or could have been.  But actual scientists, engineers, and techs have to turn the things that Elon wants to make into a reality.  \n\nYou know, like Woz had to do.\n\n(Yes I know Elon is an engineer.  No he didn't build the Falcon 9)\n

And oh how fucking wrong you were.
I decided to not take this list seriously when they added LL Bean because one shareholder voiced support for Trump.  That's not LL Bean, that's one person.  I'm honestly shocked to see them still on this list.   
This is so fucking retarded.
What are you talking about?  The people that voted this clown in absolutely deserve this.  He made it painfully obvious during the campaign that he was a terrible choice, but people couldn't see it because they were blinded by their own selfishness.  The best thing they can do now is say, "we made a mistake, and I think it's time we started correcting that mistake" but they refuse to even do that.  They continue to support this clown, because their obsession with being right outweighs their wanting to do the right thing. 
That's not a woobie.
And there is also such a thing as political capital.  If Trump wants to achieve his domestic goals, he may have to change his international tune.

The trick for really good pico de gallo is the tomatoes.  If you aren't using fresh, ripe tomatoes then you might as well give up.\n\nPersonally, I use plums, or even grape tomatoes depending on the season.  I also use serranos.  Chop the peppers and garlic, then grind them in a molcajete with some salt until you have a paste.  Lightly toss the onion and tomatoes with some olive oil.  Add the chile paste, cilantro, and lime juice and toss again.  Salt to taste.
Does that $40 billion include yearly maintenance costs?
Yes, that's what I meant.\n\nFor those curious:\n\n[Article 88](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/888)\n>Any commissioned officer who uses contemptuous words against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Governor or legislature of any State, Commonwealth, or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\n\nMilitary members are not allowed to participate in political rallies, protests, speeches, etc. while in uniform.  The Joint Chiefs are in a uniquely political/military position, but they will avoid political speak (blaming things on parties, giving political opinions publicly) and will try their best to appear apolitical.  At the next SotU address, watch the Joint Chiefs.  The only time they may clap is if Trump praises "the troops" and then one could say they are applauding the work of those under their command, not necessarily the political statement of praising the troops.  As to what the people seated behind them are applauding, that is another matter.\n\nCommanding officers will also issue directives to subordinates asking them not to use political speech on social media, usually during especially heated times (election season, aka everyday) to avoid possible UCMJ infractions.  A military member can vote and personally donate money to a political campaign but that is about the gist of their political activities.
Hah yeah.  It is.  Especially if I'm forced to use little grape tomatoes.  I just split them into eighths, so it goes faster than you'd think.  It makes a huge difference in flavor and texture, though IMO.  That said, I never really have to make a lot of it, and prefer not to because it's always best the day of.  I freaking love Pico de Gallo!
Oh look.  It's this again.

[We use a product called half-and-half.  Half heavy cream, half milk.](http://bakingbites.com/2011/11/what-is-half-and-half/)  It took over for "table cream" which was heavier.  You can't really find table cream any more.\n\nUnless you are a godless heathen, then you use non-dairy "creamer" which is a substance that should be launched into the sun.  A lot of people do use it because it is shelf stable (think an office environment) and they are used to the taste (that of pure evil).  Once you stop using it, and then have to use it again you can taste how awful it is.\n\nMy dad uses heavy cream in his coffee (33% fat) and I think it's pretty good.  A little goes a long way though.  You would only add a TSP to .5 TBSP.  He started doing that because a he would get more cups out of a carton, and half and half would cool his coffee down too much.

By people, I mean just regular, everyday citizens.  He can't stand it and he has an obsessive compulsion to try to squash that truth.  So he just tries to lie and muddy the discussion with his bullshit.

Well, were talking aren't we? LOL
I get it, the guy is a dork. I wasn't saying he isn't a dork. My point is that who cares. Leave the dork alone.\n\nAt one of my previous jobs, I worked in a level 2 helpdesk department of a very large corporation. I can tell you that I met and got to know every type of person you can imagine, including many of the types of people that are made fun of regularly (quintessential neckbeards, millennial sjw types, and every other type of person you can think of)\n\nSome of these people are the nicest people in the world. Perhaps they are weird and awkward. Perhaps they don't have great hygiene. Perhaps they have some emotional hangups. Perhaps they are annoying about their atheism because they think it makes them smarter than everyone else.\n\nBut to suggest that dorks are the type that will go postal is unfair I think. I don't see any actual evidence of that. I only see it in movies. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I know a guy from a previous job that I'm pretty sure will some day commit mass murder. But he isn't one of these dork types. I am only sure about him because I know him very well after sitting next to him for 5 years and hanging out outside of work and having mutual friends.\n\nI would never go as far as to suggest that a person that I only superficially know and think is ridiculous because of their dorkiness could somehow go postal and hurt people.\n\nPlus, you say that OP should get leeway on douchery because of this. But I can turn that around and say that OP lost all credibility when he listed having 2 phones as one of the problems. At that point OP outed himself as a douche and full of shit. 
You are correct that the current power holders will never let go. We are wasting our time trying to fix the Dem party
MDM is not cheap, but supporting devices without it is almost unimaginable.
Thank you for going through the effort of finding out the correct information and having the discussion with me.\n\nClearly you are correct and I was wrong. I apologize for being rude previously.\n\nFor the record, President Pence still technically scares me more than Trump.
I wish you were right, but I think unfortunately that you are not. If Trump gets kicked out, the nation would go back to sleep.
We all want to be Batman. Some people just take their dreams more seriously.
Let me guess, Australia.
Nuclear bombs don't care about population or GDP. They have a certain blast radius. When they are exploded over a city, they will destroy the entire city.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the city is 1 million people or 10 or 20. It certainly doesn't care about the GDP within the blast radius.\n\nTrump will nuke Tehran. I have zero doubt of it.\n\nThe only way Trump can accomplish his goals is my reestablishing US military hegemony and therefore the status of the USD. After Trump kills 20 million Iranians in ten seconds, no one will question USA authority around the world.\n\nThe US empire will be born.\n\nThe American right wing will cheer. About half of American "liberals" will shed crocodile tears. Everyone else will keep quiet out of fear. After all, if Trump is willing to burn 20 million people alive, I'm sure he would be willing to throw a few protestors in prison.
I think you are perhaps maybe being overly sensitive about his awkwardness. It's probably hard for us to tell without being in your shoes. \n\nPerhaps try to just be blunt with a smile. Say "you don't have to ask every time, it's fine, just come in and sit, relax"\n\nBut as far as the other techs, I think you aren't taking that seriously enough. In my humble opinion, that requires an immediate and forceful shut down.\n\nWhen you see an email like that with an obvious negative unhelpful non-team playing attitude, I would have immediately reprimanded the email sender with a formal written notice, sent the employee home for two days, so that the reprimand couldn't be kept secret, then sent out a department wide memo to everyone that " we are all part of a team and should always be helpful and positive with all of our interactions" (not mentioning the specific people or incident)\n\nShut it down fast so it only hurts one person once and goes no further.\n\nThis is going to sound harsh, but it's what I believe: you have no idea about this person's past, their personal life, and what led to them being this way. You have no right to judge them on anything other than their work. This teasing and bickering is not part of work. Work is not your family. People that are bothered by this person's awkward mannerism are the ones being overly sensitive, distracting and unprofessional. Tell them to get over themselves and concentrate on their job.
You hope, but we've been repeatedly disappointed by voters in the near past. Remember 2004 anyone? That was just after the start of the war in Iraq, the shock and awe, the 6 trillion Dollar theft from Social Security, and hundreds of disastrous actions by Bush and Cheney. This was after the millions of people that marched against Bush and Cheney.

I wonder about the air quality down there.
No. Their mistake wasn't in tactics or strategy. Their mistakes are fundamental to their statist philosophy. They cannot be saved.
aww, you can't spell either
No way no how.\n\nDNC did not make a strategy mistake. The DNC is fundamentally statist and therefore not salvageable.\n\nThey can't change their platform or some leaders. They must completely change everything. They won't. No one fires themselves. It doesn't happen.\n\nThere is zero chance they will select Ellison. Bernie and a few others are promoting him to show that the DNC will refuse.\n\nWe need a completely new party. We are already losing. So the pro Dem arguments don't hold. We didn't just lose the Presidency, the US Senate and the House. We also have lost nearly all the state legislatures, and governors. \n\nWith modern technology and communications, a new party can be rebuilt quickly.\n
LMAO\n\nThe comment above yours was deleted. But I can only imagine what it said.
Firstly, you are expecting your former employer to not be a dick. That isn't guaranteed. You are leaving it in their hands.\n\nSecondly, multiple accounts goes beyond just email.\n\nI have Apple DEP account setup on my work iPhone. I need it for my job and managing DEP and my MDM. I can't log into my own Apple accounts because of it. Also, my account is admin on the company o365, so I have the extra utility apps. I can't log in to my personal non work o365 account on my work phone. I do my own site management for my own personal stuff, including learning and improving my dev skills. I took a class in Sharepoint, so I purchased my own Sharepoint just to screw with stuff. I don't want to mix that with work. My job pays me enough to where my education is on my own. I pay for my own separate o365 account.\n\nSame thing with google. I have google apps which is linked to my work google account. I also have personal google apps on my personal phone with my personal data on it. I have a site I'm building and trying to improve my dev skills, all hosted in google. I don't even know how to make both of them coexist on the same phone. If I log off gmail on my personal phone then I lose all the extra google ecosystem functionality of having all my google stuff linked together.\n\nAlso, my phone is the authentication phone for lots of financial accounts and 2factor authentication for lots of things at work. One small example is that we have a print service maintenance agreement account for our 17 locations in 17 cities. My work mobile number is the primary number they contact. I travel and/or am not at my desk most of the time. Lots of our services are setup like that. I just found it easier to setup my mobile phone as the primary contact number for lots of things as I was building the infrastructure for this company. \n\nIt would be inappropriate for me to have my personal phone number be linked to all of these various services and agreements for the company I work for. I don't own the company. \n\n\nHell, even something as simple as Uber. I have my own Uber account for when I need a ride. I also have another account for Uber that is linked to my work email and work credit card. When I travel for work, sometimes I dont' rent a car and use Uber. But then I may go out with my work buddies and don't want to charge that Uber trip to work. That doesn't even include when I use Uber in my home city. Snapshoting receipts and getting reimbursed on my personal CC is a pain in the but, when I can get my assistant to just pay the bill on my work CC. Logging Uber in and out constantly is a pain in the butt.\n\n\n\nWhen I do finally leave the company, friendly or unfriendly, who the hell wants to deal with separating the phone number for all these accounts?\n\nYour comment is my point exactly about OP and lots of other arguments that come up on this sub, especially from one particular semi-famous sub contributor here. People have a tendency to only see things from the vantage point of what they know. It is hard for people to imagine or thoroughly understand that some people are simply in a completely different situation from them. If someone's situation is completely different than you, it doesn't make them wrong or less necessarily.

I use the FedEx One Rate Extra Large box (the flatter one, not the cubic one). It is the perfect size for laptops plus a charger or another item if you need it. It can even potentially fit 2 laptops.\n\nThey are super durable that they can be used more than once. They have quadruple thick walls. They fit inside the FedEx bins (surprising, I know). You can just drop them off in the bins. \n\nI bubble wrap the heck out of my gear. I don't like to cheap out on that. \n\nThe only glitch is that the box can only be used with the FedEx One Rate program, which is a bit annoying. But if you do use it with that, the box is free.\n\n\nhttps://www.fedex.com/images/ascend/us/supplies/382_lg.jpg\n\nSo, you could potentially have everything under your FedEx OneRate account and PDF email them the shipping labels.

Can anyone tell me if he actually used the word "populism" or was it possibly translated from another language in such a way that the word he used could have been translated in a different way?
So, you want 11.9 years of President Pence instead of 4 years of Trump. Because, that is what you are going to get if Trump gets impeached within a few months.\n\nAt least Trump is being fought at every turn and people are watching everything he does. The nation is paying attention. If Trump gets impeached and Pence gets in, the nation will relax and Pence will get 2.9 terms in office with no opposition.
Every scientific calculator I am able to find is either not RPN or is programmable. Even cheapie scientific calculators are programmable now.
If comparing apples to apples, 4 years of Pence would be way better than 4 years of Trump. There is no doubt.\n\nMy fear is that impeaching Trump will lead to 11+ years of Pence, which would lead to a 10-2 ultra conservative advantage in the Supreme court and a complete dismantling of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nI don't know how we would recover from that.
Damn. It's weird that Texas is actually pretty strict with knives. More than guns it seems.
OK, thanks. I'll take a look at the Casios
I am not suggesting that you can be conservative and left leaning, but maybe it's possible. My point is that the words liberal and conservative and libertarian have become messy in their meanings.\n\nIt is most obvious where the Democrats and their supporters clearly consider themselves liberal, but cannot in any way be considered left leaning any more. Left leaning requires that the primary focus be on economic justice. To me that means protecting the poor, weak, and less fortunate against the power and influence of the wealthy and powerful. I think that is the primary requirement of government. \n\nThe wealthy don't need government. They can already have what they want. It should be the primary purpose of good government to balance out the power of wealthy and protect the rights and health of the poor and weak.\n\nThe Democrats gave up on that a long time ago. But they are still clearly liberal on some social issues. They are liberal without being left. I think that is one of the main reasons our politics is in such disarray. People don't even know who is who and what is what. It's a mess.\n\nLibertarians seem to be liberal on some social issues, but only a very few. They are in fact OK with a private business discriminating against a gay person. So, how can they be considered socially liberal? They are faking it. They seem less bad than social conservatives. At least they don't want to put gay people in prison. But they aren't much better. They are only a little bit better.\n\nOn economic issues, libertarians are farther right that even most conservatives. My point about the Pence example is that some Christian conservatives actually would be in favor of assisting the poor and destitute. Libertarians would dump the poor in a ditch to fend for themselves.\n\nWith that in mind, I consider libertarians far far right extremists.\n\nAs far as whether it is possible to be left leaning and conservative, I think probably so. Look at the Pope for example. He is clearly conservative, although less so than his predecessor. But he is leaning left. He believes in economic justice, helping the poor, not favoring the wealthy, is against racism and war. That's why he has many American conservatives angry. \n\nI'm sure you have heard the statement that some people like to make: Jesus was the first socialist. He was in many ways conservative, because he moralized. But he was also clearly left leaning. But whatever, I'm not religious so it is hard for me to make that argument. I do know many people that are very religious and very much in favor of left leaning economic policies and against war.\n\n
I don't see any that are RPN
I am not interested in bi-partisan support. I don't care at all about partisan anymore. Since the Dem party and their elitist supporters betrayed people, all I want to see is for the Dem party to collapse and go away.\n\nThere should be no partisans and aisles. The Dem party is completely corrupt and needs to be rebuilt from scratch, not just adjusted and reformed.\n\nBernie is in there to show people that the Dem party will resist change. That is what he is doing. In year's time, the Dem party will implode. The power holders are not going to give up their seats. 
We seriously need to start making lots of Cartman-Trump Memes.

The USA never signed on to the International Declaration of Human Rights.
Not at all. You completely misunderstood the intent of the post and went on a rant. Everyone else understood. You made an assumption based on a rule that you made up.
I disagree with your opinion.\n\nMaking fun of stupid people or poor people or ghetto people or uneducated people is absolutely right wing.\n\nThe fundamental definition of right wing is that "might makes right". That translates into elitism. As in people who are better, stronger, faster, or smarter deserve better or more. Elitism means that people who are better or better at life are more valuable.\n\nThat is the very core and basic definition of right wing. You can scale that from people who argue that the Dem party is no longer "left wing" because they have become elitist and pro corporate by abandoning the poor and less fortunate... all the way to the most extreme fascist forms of government we have seen in the past.\n\nMaking fun of stupid people is elitist and therefore right wing. I'm sure lots of people aren't comfortable with that idea, but that doesn't make it any less true. That is why the politics of our nation is where it is. It is now fashionable for people that consider themselves "liberal" (which is not the same thing as left wing) to be very elitist while pretending to be the nice guys.\n\nI'm sure we all read and heard the many statements by supposedly liberal people after the election saying how uneducated morons and racists were the reason the current Prez got the votes. It doesn't matter if they are uneducated. If someone considers themselves superior to someone else because they are smarter or better educated, they are right wing.\n\nThey are right wing whether they accept that or not.\n\nIt hardly exists anywhere in our society anymore, as it is fashionable to make fun of dumb people doing dumb things. But there was a time when seeing a stupid person hurt themselves resulted in sympathy. Now it's "oh look at that idiot that just blew off his arm because he tried fixing his car without knowing how. hahahahaha"\n\nAnd yes, there are scales. Most people are somewhere on the scale and not purely one or the other.\n\nAlso, your example of a comedian is a red herring/whataboutitsm. Does there exist a comedian that is not clearly on the scale of right/left somewhere? How is that a surprise? How does that invalidate the existence of comedians existing on the political scale? It doesn't. Surely there are comedians that are absolutely apolitical. That doesn't prove or disprove a thing.\n\nAnd a note for clarification: left does not equal liberal and vice versa. Right does not equal conservative and vice versa. That is why our supposedly "liberal" political party is farther right than most of the right wing political parties in the civilized world. That's why you are able to say things like I know liberals that laugh at stupid people. It's because these people that you know are wearing the masks of decent humans pretending to care about humanity, but in reality are sociopaths and lack empathy.
But someone like Mike Pence would potentially consider food for hungry children or homeless shelters a Christian thing to do. A libertarian would make everything in society cash based. If you can afford your medication, then you buy it. If you can't, well too bad for you. Remember Ron Paul? He literally said that if someone can't afford their medication it's OK to let them die. His fan base literally cheered and clapped in response to him saying that on live national TV.
I'm going to need a reference for that.
I'm not. I literally don't know how I could possibly have both my personal and work data on the same phone. I have Google, Apple, and Microsoft accounts both for work and personal stuff. Even if I could figure out a way to make all of that coexist on the same phone, it would be a hassle and a mess.
Yep, I have no intention of mixing my personal data with work. 
So many people re mis informed about this legal topic it amazes me. \n\nPence would be limited to running and winning twice for President. He could legally finish Trump's term and then run and win twice after that.\n\nFor a look at the precedent, LBJ could have run for re election and could have won, but he chose to not run. He was not legally limited.
I guess this is as good as any place to ask...\n\nDoes anyone know of a good chassis, box, rack or container for housing multiple external USB 2.5" drives?\n\nI'm referring to the regular USB external HDD drives made by many brands and available nearly everywhere:\n\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/toshiba/toshiba-canviobasics3-hd-hand-sm.jpg\n\nI would like to house about 10 of them and connect them via a good USB3 hub to a net server.\n\nI am hoping I don't have to build my own chassis for this. I want it to hold about 10 drives, have adequate ventilation, hide the cables, possibly also hide the large powered USB3 hub, and then also look reasonably nice.
It gets worse: I used to work with with an ex-teammate of his, who won 3 Superbowls with him. The guy tells everyone that Brady is the most well endowed person he has ever seen.\n\nBrady literally has everything an American male has ever dreamed about.
I don't agree that it can not become more than a two party system. Third parties have existed in the past and the parties we have today haven't existed since the founding of our nation. The Republicans and Democrats want to make you think that there is no hope for another party, but it isn't true. Of course, it will require major upheaval of the establishment, but I think the time has come. What we have today cannot continue. Minor reform will not do. The simple fact is that the powerful elites in the Dem party are entrenched and will not let go.
All the major Star Wars characters have some back story. It's part of what makes Star Wars Star Wars. It's what the fans want.\n\nEven outside of Star Wars, any good story has to have a plausible explanation for how a major character came into existence. There are exceptions I'm sure. I'm not a literature expert. But I bet the vast majority of stories (especially epic sagas) have some explanation of who the major characters are.\n\nThey don't have to have a complete detailed explanation. But something about who he is and where he came from, especially since he is Force sensitive.\n\nMace didn't really have much of a back story, but he wasn't a major influence on the plot, for example.
That's Matthew Modine
Ear buds?
Did you seriously just quote the Constitution?\n\nPlease stop commenting based on your guesses and what you want to be true. The legality of what I said is not under question at all. \n\nFeel free to ask someone you will believe, instead of quoting the constitution, because law is not that simple. What you did is the equivalent of saying that the Second Amendment gives the right to bare arms and therefore I can take my gun anywhere I choose and any law to the contrary is invalid.\n\nSeriously, you are mistaken by a mile. Go ask a legal scholar or one of the legal subs here. And what does LBJ serving less than years have anything to do with anything? You make yourself look like a fool for saying that. You are quoting the constitution to "be exact" but then think that somehow because JBJ served less than 2 years people will just go "meh, let him run, it's only fair"
I seriously want to know also
/r/politics ftw 
You need an MDM and also have all devices registered with Apple DEP. \n\nThe difficulty I see is that Apple DEP is not easy to register with. I got my company done, but they do a financial check through DnB. So our devices are now registered as ours.\n\nI don't know how you can do that for devices others own and then register it with your MDM. \n\nYou would probably have to setup everything on behalf of the client in their name on their system. Maybe you can link your MDM with their DEP. I don't know.\n\nMDM capabilities are significantly limited without DEP. The brochures don't tell you that. Also it isn't enough to just have the device in DEP, you have to put it in supervised mode . This often requires a full reset of the device. So devices already out in the field already in use may get registered with DEP but not fully supervised.\n\nAlso it's one thing to get your client registered with DEP , but another to get all your devices in the DEP. You basically have to prove ownership. If client bought everything from a couple of vendors (Verizon etc) then that vendor will do it on your behalf. But if they don't have good records then it gets messy.\n\nBYOD devices will never be fully supervised. Android and other devices will also never be fully supervised. But you can manage them somewhat. Windows 10 has some nice MDM client capabilities.\n\nI ended up using Meraki MDM. I worked with Mobile Iron in the past. Don't like it but it works for some people. Before Meraki, we went through a 90 day trial of MaaS360. It was a horrible experience. The product was bad and their support was horrifyingly bad. I'm 90% happy with Meraki. So it gets an A but not an A plus 
And the Dems are losing anyway. 
I understand what you are saying. The problem is that what we used to consider left-wing or liberal is no longer left wing or liberal.\n\nThe Democratic party betrayed people. The many people in media and industry that consider themselves liberals and moderates aren't. They think they are, but they have been slowly pulled to the right since the 1990s. \n\nI know many people like this. I have them as friends and family. They believe in the system. They have achieved some success in life and think that we just need to work harder and smarter and we'll get to where we need to be. They think the future along this same path is bright. They believe that what Bill Clinton did in 1990s was the right way to go.\n\nBut I give zero credit for the economic successes of the 1990s to Clinton. The 1990s were a perfect storm of technological innovation in many areas and the benefits of a collapsed USSR. In fact, the only thing I can say Clinton actually did was destroy wellfare and put more non-violent people in prison and give them felony records. We are paying for that today because many of these people with minor marijuana felony violations can no longer vote.\n\nThe Dem party was fooled by the success of the 90s into believing that it is the way of the future. They purged progressives from their ranks saying that it was the old antiquated way. \n\nAlong with this came the many people in media and industry who are privately Dem supporters. Let's not forget that if you see someone on national TV (like the famous news media faces we all know), they are privately very successful. They came to believe that economic booms are good for the general public and that we all just need to be nicer to each other and less prejudice. They think that is enough. They believe in the system that has made them successful and they surround themselves with like minded people that preach to us every night on TV.\n\nThey live in a bubble and don't understand what is going on in the real world. They think they do, but they don't. They try and get it, but they don't. They think they are interested and sympathize, but on some level they came to believe like Clinton did. They believe that if you "work had and play by the rules" you will become successful.\n\nThey are lost. They don't get it. I'm not the only one saying this. There are many people who have written about how the "socially liberal" people that live in Silicon Valley and the media are living in a bubble and just don't get it. They have turned elitist without realizing it.\n\nELITISM IS BY DEFINITION RIGHT WING.\n\nThis is why Trump won. The Dem party and their upper middle class and elitist supporters have abandoned and betrayed people. In some sense, they are a bigger problem than the Republicans. We know who the Republicans are and why we must oppose them. The Dem party and their elitist supporters pretend to be on our side, but are really working against us.\n\nThe vote for Trump was an FU to the Dem party AND EVERYONE THAT FANATICALLY SUPPORTED HILLARY AT ALL COSTS. Keep in mind also that Hillary got about 10 million less votes in total than Obama did in 2008. She should have gotten more. The loss was more anti-Dem than pro Trump.\n\nThe Dems and their elitist supporters still don't get it.\n\nI don't like the Daily Caller or what they say. But I can tell you that in my personal life, some of the biggest scumbags that I have ever met call themselves liberal Democrats and some of the nicest, most generous, most honest, and least racist people that I have met consider themselves conservative Christians.\n\nI no longer accept what Dems and their elitist supporters say, even when it sounds good. I pay attention to the details. By corollary, if I don't accept the viewpoint of elitist fake liberals, I don't dismiss what the supposedly conservative media says. If anything, it gives me a window into the thoughts and culture of what people who consider themselves conservatives are thinking.
Seriously WTF

Yes, with DEP and fully configured MDM, you can basically fully auto configure a device. If you need to do a factory wipe due to trouble or a new user, you can just do a factory wipe and the device will get auto configured with everything necessary automatically. \n\nYou can't accomplish that without DEP the MDM will require user acknowledgements on many actions. For example, it will ask to install with a pop up instead of silently installing the app
The Dem party has actively worked against us and betrayed us. They are beyond redemption.\n\nThose corrupt individuals in the Dem party will hold on to power and never let go. It's their livelihood. It's naive to think they will ever let true reform happen.\n\nThe Dem party is now the centrist pro corporate party with a friendly face. We need an actual progressive party. The Dems will never let their party become progressive.\n\nWhat's the benefit of staying with them if they are losing elections anyway? \n\nNot only are the Dems losing in national races, but state level races are all lost too. The majority of Governors and State Legislatures are not Republican. Why do you want to stick with the losers?
Thank you, I also enjoyed our discussion.
Devices meant Apple mobile devices. That is all everyone here has been talking about here. This whole thread has been about Apple devices. Read the title. You are the only person talking Meraki hardware. Everyone else understood what I said
No, it's the opposite of what you think was intended. It's simply a listing of relevant news. 
You are incorrect. Please be careful making statements as fact, when in fact you are incorrect legally. Pence would be limited to running and winning twice. \n\nFor example, LBJ could have run for re election bud didn't.
OK thanks !
>DNC candidates\n\nI don't support any DNC candidate, no matter what they do or what they say they stand for. Their first action needs to be renouncing the DNC.\n\nBernie is the exception because he started this entire new movement and is tearing the DNC up from the inside.\n\nThey won't select Ellison. Just watch. There is zero chance of it happening. They will make it look good though.\n\nThe DNC needs to collapse and go away.
You can't manage, monopolize, or control the total market supply of renewable energy.\n\nI'm not an economist. But the basic economic classes will tell you that being able to even slightly manipulate the market price of a good will yield gigantic profit results on this scale.\n\nThe terminology is that without a premium on the price of what you are selling, the is very little "economic profit" which is different than how regular profit is calculated in accounting.\n\nI'm not the best person to explain this since it's not my field. But even a tiny restriction or influence on the market is what gives the oil companies their massive profits. They won't be able to do that with renewable energy.
It's still there. This isn't for Meraki hardware. This is the MDM service for other mobile devices and computers.
You can control individual devices and groups of devices without a problem. It's just a matter of setting up different tags and in Meraki you can even setup different "networks"\n\nAlso, in the Apple DEP portal, you link you MDM with the DEP. While each client absolutely will need their own DEP, I bet you can link several DEP with a single MDM. In my DEP portal it looks like it is possible.
and perhaps land it in New Mexico?
Not at all. It is shameful. But as a Redditor, every once in a while we make purely factual comments just to add to the discussion.
In what way is my comment immature?\n

hillary lost :)
I live in a nice comfortable friendly suburban neighborhood of Houston, TX. There is a creek in our neighborhood that was turned into a pretty nice walking park. I use it regularly for walking and running. \n\nThere are lots of families around. There are also a few animals. There are ducks and turtles and several other types of interesting looking birds. \n\nThe other day I walked by a father who was with his young son. I would guess the kid was maybe 6 years old? I don't really know. But definitely little. They had paused on the edge of the creek to watch the ducks. The kid was grabbing rocks and slinging them aiming at the ducks.\n\nIt wasn't just once or twice. He kept grabbing rocks and trying to hit the ducks. The father didn't give a shit. \n\nI guess some people think this is normal. \n\nIf I was Jack Reacher, I would have probably beat the crap out of the father as a lesson and told him to quit teaching his son to be a psychopath. But, luckily for the father, I am a whimp and also afraid of the legal consequences of assaulting another human. \n\nThat father is a piece of shit though and his kid will grow up to be an asshole.
Optiplex 780? What century is this?
Just in general, comedy throughout history has been more left leaning. It may be difficult to see that because what does "left" mean after all. But it is easier to see if you look at it as "definitely not-right wing" as opposed to trying to decide if it is left.\n\nFor example, there is some comedy that can easily offend and upset people that consider themselves "liberal" or left. George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Chris Rock, Bill Burr and Bob Saget offend(ed) many people. It's hard to say if their thoughts are "liberal" or "left". But they definitely are the opposite of right wing or conservative.\n\nThis has been true throughout history. Troubadours and Court Jesters relatively speaking were more left than the people who paid them.\n\nComedy from a Conservative or Right-Wing vantage point is difficult, because it is by nature more restrictive. How do you make people hear something they have never heard before if your conservatism is limiting what you can say. Not that it can't be done, but many "conservative" jokes too easily can get into the realm of "dad jokes". But as an example of someone who was able to make people laugh with modest jokes, consider Rita Rudner. I'm sure some people don't like her. But I think she was pretty funny for her time.\n\nWhen right wing comedians try to get edgy, they quickly start sounding angry and hateful, which doesn't lend itself to laughter easily. Not that it can't be done. But there is only so many ways to make fun of stupid people or poor people before you start sounding like an ahole. Consider for example people like Dennis Miller and Larry the Cable Guy. They were both pretty popular for a while. But they couldn't change their routine after a few years and faded out of fame. When you comedy is based on anger, it can be edgy and new for a while, but then it can't grow. People get tired of it. Remember Rodney Dangerfield? He was pretty funny for a while. But then he started trying new material and his politics became obvious. It just wasn't as funny anymore. When he started making jokes about lazy people without jobs, he quit being funny.\n\nPenn and Teller might be considered the exception to this general rule. They are far to the right and have been around for many years. They still make people laugh. I say that even though I don't watch them. I could possibly say that they have more of a niche audience and perhaps that has made them survive long term.\n\nSouth Park can be considered another exception. Although it is hard to pin them down as right wing. I consider them right wing, but they attack the right often too. I think perhaps there are too many famous silly liberals and so perhaps they are easier to make fun of. They were once quoted as saying "I hate conservatives, but I fucking hate liberals". I don't think that defines that right wing, but I think the majority of the jokes attack liberals (which is different than left-wing). But they do also heavily attack racists and religious bigots, etc...   So, maybe they aren't really right wing.\n\nSo, your question was about right wing news comedy. But I think the reason you don't see that isn't so much because of the news part but because of the comedy part.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some TV shows that are pretty right wing whose audience watches it for laughter. Like all the live reality cops shows. I don't think too many people from the left side of the political spectrum watch that heavily. Some do, but the audience is mostly right wing. They get a laugh out of watching "stupid ghetto scummy people" do bad things and be caught. Also, all the "Darwin Award" type shows are right wing, even if they don't look political. These shows still exist. People watch them to laugh at people dumber than them. They are inherently right wing, even if the audience doesn't realize it is.\n\nFor the closest thing I can think of that would be considered a newsish show, it would be that Tosh 2.0 show. I don't think it is around anymore. And I don't think people watching it would consider it right wing, but that is a philosophical view point of mine that can be argued. The show was primarily making of fun of dumb people doing dumb things. Some of it as purely Internet memes or whatever, but the tone of the show was one that primarily made fun of people being dumb. \n\nTLDR = Right Wing comedy just really isn't as funny long term. It can be funny for a bit, but it dies out. News shows need a long term audience with regularly scheduled daily or weekly shows. Right wing angry making fun of poor or stupid people runs out of being funny after a few repeated showings.
Yep, that must be it. The reason the USA has a problem with the International Declaration of Human Rights is because of the need for sovereignty. \n\nI'm sure our military hegemony protecting the USD around the world has nothing to do with it. \n\nThose other nations that signed on are all a bunch of pussified citizenry willing to let someone else tell them if it is OK to torture or not torture whoever they want. I mean, if someone is a traitor to our nation, I think we should be able to lock them in a dungeon and throw away the key. amiright?
There are theories about that. Firstly, there could be different skill power types. Palpatine could stand right next to Yoda and Mace and maintain cover. He was able to generate a cloud over the entire galaxy. Also some have theorised that he could have fight back but was playing possum for the benefit of turning Anakin.
LOL at "debunked"\n\nWe are all Star Wars fans here, but such statements are a little ridiculous for fiction don't you think? So there may have been some thread in the past where there was some consensus. Somehow that equals debunked? \n\nAre we confusing prevailing fan theories with science now? LMAO
I appreciate what you are saying. But from a philosophical point of view, if we stand back and carefully read what you said, that level of military worship is bordering on Fascism itself. My statement sounds extreme, because I know it was heroic military people that defeated Fascism. But we should be clear and careful about what we say we believe, lest we become what we abhor.\n\nMaking the wearing of medals illegal is in the same category of making flag burning illegal. It's offensive to many, but the whole reason America is a beacon to the world is because we have certain philosophies and rules others don't.\n\nI appreciate the military. There was a time when l was young that I considered joining. I have several ranked military in my family. I have one family member buried at Arlington. But I respectfully disagree with your statement.
The problem is the definition of corruption. I consider many things corruption that are not technically illegal.\n\nI am calling the entire agenda of the Democratic party corrupt. The Democratic party is supposed to be resisting the power of the oligarchy. But instead, they are part of the corporatist system. They only superficially look nicer because of liberal stances on some social issues.\n\nI believe that economic justice is the primary issue of concern in all government. The Democrats gave up on that a long time ago (90's Clinton era). They are now supporting the corporations and fool us into thinking they are on our side by being nicer about some social issues. \n\nThat is what I call corruption. It is the entire party. I am not referring to some specific politician taking bribes. It's the entire agenda of the Dems that is corrupt because it is dishonest.
I'm not saying I am pro or against any of the following arguments, but here are some that I can think of that people may be thinking in some combination or other:\n\n - Even if they show prejudice, us being prejudice against them isn't right. The reality is that most Muslims are born into and conditioned into their beliefs. Demonizing their entire culture doesn't solve a thing. There are over a billion of them and they are increasing (compared to other populations). They aren't going anywhere. Engaging your opposition is the only way.\n\n - Allowing any room for prejudice is a slippery slope. MLK said it his way. We have all pretty much heard the "they came for...and there was no one left" quote from the 1930s (I'm too lazy to look it up). Even if Muslim beliefs are determined to be wrong, we know that the majority of people that hate Muslims are doing it out of prejudice.\n\n - A very large percentage of non-Muslims still don't respect gay rights. I also believe a very large number on non-Black Americans are prejudice against African Americans. I see it around me every single day. The difference is that American culture is primarily pro-business and we have learned to be more careful about how we reveal our personal opinions to others. I see bigots around me daily. I am a minority, but due to chance, I look pretty white bread and have zero accent. It is amazing the things people will say and do around me before they figure out my name is not English. So, the point here is that I believe we are close to being just as bad here in the USA, but we simply hide it better. That means the difference is just presentation. Muslims are simply more frank about their prejudices. Perhaps then singling them out as particularly anti-gay is not beneficial to us because it may be simply be a case of us trying to make ourselves feel better about ourselves.\n\n - Despite all the things that Muslims do and say that is wrong, if we were honest about it, we know that the majority of people in the USA that have a problem with Muslims are bigots. Many people that don't want Muslim culture to become part of the USA are not bigots. But the reality is that most of the anti-Muslim talk comes from bigots. These same bigots are easily bigots against other groups at different times under different situations. We really don't want to align ourselves with or give any strength or validity to these bigots. There is a quote whose source I don't know, but it says something like "the best lies are 90% true". A bigot may say something that looks like truth at a particular time and place. But allowing the bigot's statement to stand give legitimacy to the bigot, which then will turn around and their future or other bigotry.
Yes, these people want to judge her as a "Dem". They are evaluating to see if they can "promote her as a Dem".\n\nI don't care one bit about that. I no longer believe in the Dem party at all. They need to collapse before they can be rebuilt.\n\nI care about what she believes in and what she does.\n
Much better than the other guys explanation. Thanks.
You can have a device added to DEP, but you need to provide proof for Apple. You have to call their corporate support, and they will have you fill out a form and then scan and send them your receipt from the store you bought it from. I can't even imagine doing that one device at a time.
Our Constitution is intentionally worded vaguely and is open to interpretation (as per quotes of our founders). Laws and how they get applied in today's life are much more technical, detailed, and nuanced than the principles laid out in our Constitution. I followed my statement above by giving the example how many people use the Second Amendment and ignorant argument to suggest that the Constitution (if applied correctly) bans all limits on all weapons in all places under all circumstances. So yes, quoting the constitution is often not relevant. It happened to be so in this case, as I responded to /u/keyboardchap below. But it was a more technical discussion than when most people quote the Constitution.
I agree. The rest of the team is being unprofessional. I suspect OP is young and doesn't have much experience in management. It doesn't look like OP is ready to admit that the people he likes are the problem. Hopefully he'll learn without the awkward guy paying the price.
Thanks, I'll look at that
It's going to take losing badly in 2018 and Trump being re elected in 2020 before the right wing DNC collapses. Unfortunately, it's almost assured at this point that the Republicans will win almost everything in the next two elections. \n\nI'm just going to keep my head down and try to survive this mess. The DNC power holders will not let go. It's their livelihood they are fighting for.\n\nWe won't see a new progressive party until after Trump's re election. That's when their arguments for party unit will finally collapse.
You are supposed to ask "What's that in Freedom units?"
Yes, exactly. Where was he during EP6? By what means did he get into his position of power? He just poof took over the First Order?
That's the key. I want someone that is as honest and sincere as a politician can be. And I want someone that is on my side at least some of the time.\n\nBernie is the most sincere politician I have seen in a long time. And his agenda is one that is mostly good for me. Not all of it is, but that's OK.\n\nI get the same feeling from Tulsi. I think she seems sincere and seems to mostly be pushing for things that are beneficial to my life.\n\nHillary was exactly the opposite of that. The most insincere politician in a long time. Even Trump seems more sincere compared to Hillary. 
In my opinion, libertarians are extremely right wing. For example, we had a libertarian candidate this last election, Gary Johnson. The guy was so far right that he made people like Mike Pence look compassionate. The interesting part is that some conservatives are sometimes compassionate, because they believe in their Christianity so strongly. I mean, they are also ruthless in many instances. But I would much prefer a President Mike Pence than a President Gary Johnson. At least I'm pretty sure Mike Pence wouldn't drop nukes on random countries. The libertarian candidate may look safer because they say they don't want to intervene in foreign nations. But if push came to shove, the libertarian is only one tiny step away from the Ayn Rand type Objectivist. These people would wipe the planet of other humans if they thought it would improve their profit margin by 5%.
I'll buy your ebook when you publish it. Hopefully you'll notify us. I would actually prefer a basic PDF or something. But I'll take the Amazon ebook.\n\nI've thought of building my own rocket stove with some personal modifications. Your engineering is great.

Yea, OP is a bit of a douche - very full of himself.\n\nIs the guy a dork? Surely. But who the hell cares.\n\nThe other day there was an IT Manager that posted a long rant about a guy who he admitted does good work, but I is a bit awkward and overly formal.\n\nTypically it's young people that are a bit smarter than average but didn't quite get to med school or get the MS from MIT. Hopefully he'll grow out of it or at least learn to not harass dorks. Maybe he just needs to get laid.
Once you get your DEP device in full supervision mode, you can do pretty much everything with the device. Force checkins, push apps, remove and block apps. setup alerts, geofencing, send files, configure the icons on the home screen, force security policies, force software updates, the list goes on and on and on.\n\nAnd the main thing is that once a device is setup in DEP, it cannot be removed in the field. So, the device is worthless to a thief.\n\nAlso, DEP is the only way to prevent the activation lock. If a user puts in their on iCloud, the phone can still be locked from activation after a factory wipe. But with DEP you can remove that. \n\nAlso without DEP, the Meraki client app can be removed.
Where is here?
The International Declaration of Human Rights is not a minor triviality that should be left to common sense and common law. It is a big deal that should have been ratified by all nations of the UN - FORMALLY.\n\nThe USA didn't ratify it specifically because the USA doesn't want to be limited by it. That should tell you something about the USA.
No where in this entire thread is anyone discussing Meraki hardware. I just reread the thread up to the top. You misread something. The device purchases being discussed are Apple mobile devices purchased through DEP channels. There is no discussion at all anywhere here about Meraki hardware. There is no mention of it at all. Cisco is using the Meraki brand for two completely different products. 
No driver's license?
For context on above comment, I'm not an MSP. I'm just an IT Manager for a company with a huge mobile workforce in many cities. I read this sub just out of interest.
Damn you for showing that to me. Now I have to leave work early and go to Home Depot
Dude, you are totally confusing two completely separate products. The Cisco Meraki MDM Systems Manager has nothing to do with Cisco Meraki hardware (sort of).\n\nYes, Cisco uses the Meraki Systems Manager for the Meraki hardware. But this is a completely different product and has completely different licensing. Potentially, if you have both products you can manage it all within the same portal. But the licenses are not even called the same thing.\n\nThis is an MDM product that is purely for mobile devices and also has some remote management features that can be used for PCs/laptops.\n\nBut just to be sure, because you made me doubt myself, I went and just now created a completely new free account with a completely different email address. Yes, it's still there and it still works.\n\nThis has nothing to do with buying Cisco hardware.
Title is so bad it makes you wonder if they did it on purpose.

Yes, MkLeo won one last month. Also, MkLeo is a Marth main and between 2nd and the 4th best player in the game. \nMost top players currently believe Marth is high to top tier and anywhere from 8th to 12th on the roster. 
And you were wrong loool
Yeah, that's how logic works right? As long as we can convince ourselves the other side has done worse, it's okay to be as fucked up as we want.

Well at least he's more attractive than Michelle Obama
Lol you can't even respond
You fucking do that every damn time I try to talk to you about anything even if it's not important you just say whew and to be honest it makes me feel rejected and unheard like nothing would be better that that bullshit who the fuck just says whew after you tell them something important I just don't understand how you think that's ok and I swear to god you're probably just gonna say whew to this but when you do you'll know that you're slowly killing me inside
And yet it has far more, hmm 🤔
Oh shit, this is the first thing that's made me laugh on this subreddit.

Some reference to Vimy would have been nice for one.\n\n
Yup, these are two entirely different markets currently.\n\nEducation will transform owners from one group to the other however.
You are engaging in a conversation about generational relationships and relationships with power imbalances.\n\nI asked if you wanted to engage in a conversation about how we define "pedophile" and if the legal definition is correct in all cases. \n\nFor example how do you feel about two different couples in two different states, in both cases the boy is 18 and the girl is 16, they have been dating for 3 years and in all possible ways they are identical.\n\nDo you agree that one of those boys is a pedophile and one is not depending on state laws where they reside?\n\nWhich boy is the pedophile and which one is not?\n\nOr try just answering this, in the entire history of the planet has there even been a human who is ready for sex 1 day before their 16th birthday?\n\n\nI would love to use me as an example but I was one who wasn't ready for sex early. A couple of my friends were ready enough though if you ask me or them or the person one of them married.\n\nSo, do you agree with me and Milo or is the law an exact representation of our human sexual reality?\n\nNow, if you can accept that some people younger than our currently defined legal age are ready for sex we can move on to what you want to talk about.\n\nI don't see any point continuing without a framework and understanding of pedophile, since you throw it around so easily at people.\n\nPlease keep in mind neither Milo nor I are arguing that the law should be changed, only that it is imperfect. I think we can all agree that currently we have no possible way to know these ages in any quantifiable way and the current laws should stay pretty close to what they are now.
He isn't a pedophile apologist he is someone who thinks the law is too rigid in its definition. Specifically his point is that not everyone is spiritually, physically and mentally mature enough on an arbitrary date like 16th or 18th birthdays.\n\nWhat do you think about that point?\n\nDo you think that there is a magic bullet age that everyone before is not mature enough and everyone after is? Currently that is how we define pedophile. His definition is a bit more flexible, not much, just a bit.\n\nTo you that makes him like young boys. That is a HUGE leap.\n\nCare to actually engage in conversation about that point, or will you just repeat your claim that is obviously so simplistic as to not resemble reality?
"Hacked to pieces"\n\nWere they supposed to eat it whole?

So in this round it seems there is no room to start earlier, I do not think the donald is full of piss and shit and just and I do not think the odor sticks so much as you do.\n\nI certainly don't feel smelly in this conversation for example even though I did visit the donald yesterday and have not showered since.\n\nTo flip the conversation I could say that people that supported Hillary were delusional and stupidly naive man haters and as such not worth talking to. It would divide us to have such a *public* stance and make us argue about that which does not matter. I do not want to do it about Hillary and I do not want to do it about Trump.\n\nYou hear no whining about disagreement from me, none, you do hear whining about not being able to talk because of that disagreement. \n\nLook we are talking about enough people to elect a president. On just the donald there are over 350,000 *registered* users, from previous reddit numbers published you can assume that ten times that amount lurk and 1/10th that amount post give or take, even fewer shit post and act like you hate.\n\nYour argument boils down to this if you use those numbers.\n\nFewer than 35,000 people on reddit act badly so we should ignored 3.5 million people because it is a minority anyway?\n\nDangerous thinking to ignore so many just because "minority" imo. That kind of thinking going on long enough will alienate enough people they might vote for a bad choice for president or something . . .\n\nWhy would you see these people as a potential partner in my poltics? \n\nThere is nothing to do about it, either you can talk to them or not but they remain a partner in your politics. They vote, they talk, they set policy. It is up to you if you want to put your head in the sand (stay in your echo chambers) or join the conversation. At this point on reddit there isn't even a choice for the 2nd one for you even if you wanted to.\n\nYour view about posters on the donald, like many others who share your political ideas, is wrong. I know it to be wrong because it is about me and people I know far better than you know them. I also know how easy it is to be wrong in that way as I experience it daily. \n\nI think very similar things about Hillary supporters.\n\nInstead of jumping from fact to conclusion I would like very much to discuss how that process happens. How that conclusion is drawn and what possible gaps in logic happened during that conclusion. I could then apply them to myself because I think the exact same things about people who support Hillary as you do about people who support Trump, they are so delusional and vile they are not worth talking to.\n\nTo my mind r/politics adopts a wounded, persecuted posture that I think is childish. They brigade like hell, and I have tried to talk about this on dozens of subs and they all are there down voting and attacking by the dozens, every time. They can't handle a conversation about politics if it includes two sides, what the fuck is a political conversation with only one side anyway?\n\nWell as long as that is the conversation you want, you can have it all over reddit. \n\nMe? I am a the donald supporter (not Trump so much) *because* I don't agree with how either side is acting on reddit, you all seem to be painted with the same brush to me.\n\nMost people I talked to that voted for Trump didn't, they voted against Hillary, or for teaching the Dems a lesson about primaries. There are not a lot of TRUMP supporters OMG, we just act like that on the donald as a reaction to years of behavior and it is that behavior that I would love to "unpack".\n\nAgain thanks for talking, thanks even more for talking with civility and thought, and thanks a whole lot for not including insults with your points.\n\nKeep going if you like, I am here.\n\nMy personal interest for where the topic might go would be how you got from "A minority of Trump supporters act badly" to "we should ignore all 60 million of them" type of thinking I see so often. Do you not understand you have some absolute rabid cunts on your side (male and female cunts, don't start calling me sexist for using female anatomy instead of calling them "dicks" or something) who act just as badly as *our* rabid cunts?\n\nAre you even thinking that it might be the same rabid cunts on both sides being paid by a 3rd party to keep us divided?\n\nThat would be another good topic to discuss. Correct the Record and the Trump fools who do the same things as CTR for free.\n\nHave you seen "Century of Self"? I see a lot of that type of manipulation in this. Want to talk about that?
Horribly wrong, you are missing the victims for one. Do they not exist? Are those hot young boys pedophiles?\n\nSo yes you are wrong. Since we established that your black and white view of the world is not correct in this instance. Can you consider that it might be wrong about more people than those young boys who you just called pedophiles or pedophile sympathizers. 
Obviousness, each jar holds over 30 grams dried flower.\n\nHaving weighed hundreds we don't need a scale to know.
Different person here but I love him for his willingness to put himself in situations that are hard for him in order to point out issues that society faces.\n\nThere are easier ways to point out those issues and he knows that, he chooses to do it the way that draws negative attention because it is more effective. \n\nI don't really like listening to him but I love that he is talking. Society needs people who will keep the conversation wide, and he does that.
He said nothing of the sort. He said some young boys that are sexually mature can be of a sound enough mind to give informed consent. For those boys a mature first relationship can be beneficial.\n\nHe further defined pedophilia as sex with a boy who was not sexually mature or who was not mature enough mentally to consent.\n\nBasically his point was that if the legal age in your state is 16, not everyone is both sexually and mentally mature on their birthdays exactly, some might be mature one day earlier, some one day later.\n\nIf you are going to hate, at least get it right.\n
As many many others have said you have nothing to worry about. 
I wouldn't exactly say I was a supporter of the regime, I picked Trump over Hillary however and I agree with you completely.
If we turn sun into energy they are going to do just fine, they have a bit of sun you see.
Yeah um, not so much as a "whole bunch" compared to the non Quebec part of Canada.\n\n Though French Canadians comprised nearly 30 percent of the Canadian population, they made up only about 4 percent of Canadian volunteers. Less than 5 percent of Quebec’s males of military age were enrolled in infantry battalions, compared to 14-15 percent in Western Canada and Ontario. Moreover, half of Quebec’s recruits were English Canadian and nearly half of French-Canadian volunteers came from provinces other than Québec. The result was an angry national debate concerning French Canada’s, and especially Québec’s, manpower contribution.\n\nAfter Borden went to visit Vimy in May 1917 he went back to Canada and on May 18th 1917 announced conscription to solve this issue of Quebec participation of both English and French speakers. It was instituted August 28. Anti-conscription demonstrations occurred regularly in Montreal in the summer of 1917. Angry crowds broke office windows at the pro-conscription Montreal newspaper, The Gazette.  The home of Lord Atholstan, proprietor of the equally pro-conscription Montreal Daily Star, was dynamited earlier that month although he escaped unharmed. Recruiting officers in various parts of Québec made themselves scarce for fear of their lives. Crowds chanted: “Nous en avons assez de l’Union Jack!”\n\nWhen more than 9 out of 10 participants are English of an event that created a sense of nationhood that had not existed before it might be a relevant answer to the question.\n\n"what would you have liked to see at the ceremonies to represent English Canadian culture?"\n
Oh no I am sure you are right since it isn't rainbows it *must* be "violent uprising". I mean these are the only two options on the "flag scale" right? /s\n\nSo far you have shown no one revering the flag because it stands for a violent uprising. \n\nYour idea of half isn't accurate on your claim, but you keep doubling down on being wrong. Rainbows, that's convincing. . .

Not running a smear campaign against an honest opponent would be respectable.\n\nNot running a smear campaign against Hillary was just foolish.

Might want to check out your understanding of the word "half".
What I would do is not the topic, you really have a hard time talking and staying on a single issue don't you.\n\nThe issue you are avoiding that I tried to start talking about was "how do we define who is a pedophile".\n\nNot - what would Bascome do at a Hollywood party. \n\nLet me ask you this, if you are at a Hollywood party and you see a pattern of behavior that as a previously molested child you know means that underage sex is going on. \n\nHowever, you are not sure that everyone else is as aware as you are, and if they are aware you are not sure anyone cares. Including the chief of police of Hollywood who is at the party. The young boy in the room is a Hollywood star who would have their career ruined if it got out. \n\nAlso the young boy is 3 days from being "legal"\n\nDo you recognize that we can't judge based on your limited opinion which is based on Milos limited testimony?\n\nOr do you still see it so black and white as good and bad behavior?\n\nWould you take your case that everyone would deny and that you have no proof of to the police with the only results being your career is ruined?\n\nIf you choose not to do that are you absolutely a pedophile or apologist?\n\nYeah um, no. \n\nYou might be a victim yourself from the same people 10 years earlier and just dying inside hoping your currently failing career doesn't lead you to suicide. \n\nYou might be a mother who is in such denial she can't see.\n\nYou might be blind drunk and unable to notice.\n\nThere are a lot of people at that party who I can imagine as neither pedophile or apologist, I find it incredibly sad you can't.\n\nNow what if those boys who are described as extremely young are 3 days from legal and clearly mature enough to handle what is going on? (how do I know they are clearly mature enough, I don't just go with it for the sake of the question).\n\nYour black and white world is not mine, I see a lot of grey. So does Milo. To you that means we are pedophiles or apologists. To me you are so narrow in your views as to be unable to see or discuss reality.\n\nYour opinion is wind, nothing more. You can't *really* apply it to life, life is complex.
You are not even listening to what my view is yet.\n\nLet me know when you want to talk about some serious issues, how you feel about me isn't one.\n
Certain prisons have a rape culture, as well as historical examples like the Spartans. \n\n\nAgainst women in North America? No, we have laws against that and we use them.

You want to talk about 12 million in relation to the US budget and call it fiscally irresponsible? \n\nHow about fiscally irrelevant? \n\nIf you want to talk about government money mistakes I am still waiting to talk about the trillions missing in Iraq. No way I get all riled up about this pittance. \n\nI also don't trust the numbers yet. I would not at all be shocked to learn that they include numbers against Trump that are not included in the Obama figures.\n\nI can see it going like this. \n\nAgent is assigned a job to find *ALL* the numbers that can be possibly related to anything Trump has done when away from the White House. Reach an absurdly inflated figure.\n\nDo search for article about Obama from a "trusted source" to compare this number to. The number for Obama however was created by White House staffers or perhaps a democratic "investigative" journalist and they *only* include values specifically related to only the travel costs, nothing else.\n
Ok you got your upvote, where is my million dollars!
Not yet, we can go further.
The topic I have been trying to discuss. We have several echo chambers, in fact most subs are turning into echo chambers.\n\nDo you see that?\n\nIf so do you notice that it is all happening at once?\n\nIf so do you conclude that is odd? Active conversation systematically being eliminated from reddit.\n\nDo you consider that the same people listed in this link about Merkel might also be the same people doing it on both sides and monetizing it or worse, they are doing contract work.\n\nDo you even see this is happening more ways than we are talking about in this thread?\n\nStuff like that, things to find common ground so we can work together. Instead of finding the differences so we can fight like this entire thread.\n\nNow if you do see some of the things I see what can we do?\n\nWell if we have a systematic introduction of ideas and conversations that eliminate real exchanges of ideas because of entrenched subs and ideas what can we do?\n\nClearly there is a problem having real conversation on the donald, should we start there because "they are the worst offenders"?\n\nOr do you see that maybe they are the worst offenders because they are the group with the smallest natural breathing room on reddit. SO many subs they can't go to discuss anything, even before the election even talking about Trump was banned, just like Ron Paul (he can't win anyway) kind of talk.\n\nJust like Ron Paul they went and make their own space.\n\nPersonally I think if you want to silence them you are wrong, if you want to make rules to eliminate their methods you are wrong, if you want to ban them you are wrong.\n\nHowever if you want to understand them and what they think and find out how they can think such different things than you and find common ground I am interested in finding a way how to do that. \n\nWhere should we start, can't be here I got so many downvotes I am on a spam filter 5 minute reply rule so I won't be answering in a timely manner if at all. I am effectively silenced here (it isn't a claim it is an actual reddit built in rule you guys are ignoring you see).\n\nSo if you want to talk, we have to go somewhere else, where  neither of us will get downvoted for talking politics, where do you suggest we go?\n\nTo me that is topic number one in a converation about politics, how do we facilitate reasonable exchange of ideas, it is impossible here, it is impossible on the donald.\n\nHow do we solve that one?
Weird Al is one of them.
Century of Self will go well with Foucault. It is long but by the end you might wish it had been longer.\n\nAs far as the my side and your side stuff I mean the sides we are representing in this discussion, you are the "reasonable liberal democrat" I am the "rapist sexist racist Trump supporter"\n\nAs far as the donald, you can't address them as a group, that is sort of my point in this whole larger thread. You need to make entertainment more hospitable so that when a trump supporter is revealed he is welcomed and challenged rather than identified and eliminated. \n\nSame for all the neutral subs and for certain r/politics is failing the role it claims to fill.\n\nThis method will lead to the most reasonable conversation and certainly more than we have now.\n\nPeople only have so much time and energy in the day. Now that I have talked a bit of politics with you that is time I didn't spend on the donald. \n\nYou just drained it a bit.\n\nThe only reason I have heard this won't work is each of those subs saying "we won't allow those type of people in the conversation because other people we see as the same are doing things we don't like" they just don't know they are saying it because they see them the same.\n\nHope you are having a good day. I hope this exchange of ideas makes it better not worse. It is for me, and thanks for the book recommendation. 
She could have been building a case to take him for everything, going to counseling then finding more proof really puts the nails in the coffin of a divorce case.
Ok if you don't want to talk about it that's fine.\n Defining what is a pedophile within the context of his comment is extremely relevant to if he actually is a pedophile. If you don't want to discuss that then I have trouble understanding why you think he is a pedophile.\n\nIs it because he knows that some 15 year old girls can look sexual, is that what now makes him a pedophile?\n\nIf I talk about that will you move the goal posts again to yet another comment?\n\n
You might have 4 wheel drive but you don't have 8 wheel stop.\n\nThen they look at me and say "huh?"
I think the drivers won't get paid enough for the risk. Other than that I am all for it.
No you are not understanding it, first line is wrong and not what I am saying.\n\nThe donald is not a haven it is a reaction that has become the only thing it can be, an echo chamber useless for discussion. The people on the donald however, not so useless, just the location.\n\nThe donald is not asking for this at all, I am. Do you seriously not see a need to discuss anything with anyone you don't agree with. There is no place for that on reddit.\n\nThere are rules on reddit to solve this problem, do not downvote that which you don't agree with as long as it is on topic and provides value to the conversation. If we followed those rules we wouldn't have a problem. \n\nThe majority of reddit needs to deal with the donald, if not they need to deal with the people on it, if not they need to deal with what the people do, if not they need to deny reality.\n\nGood luck finding a solution, to be clear the current state of affairs resulted in President Donald Trump.\n\nI thought there would be more agreement that a solution was a good idea.\n\nBlame is all anyone here cares about though, and focusing on me and my "victimhood" of course, dozens of replies on that.\n\nAgain, fair warning I have a 5 minute spam filter from down votes here so I may or may not reply next time depending on if I already used my reply on someone else.\n\n

Jokes are funny, sorry I missed it but try including some funny next time so you don't have to explain it to me.
I can see your point of view and I agree with everything you say about "the donald" but you don't seem to understand that they people on the "the donald" are the same people on asktrumpsupporters.\n\nThey just act differently on those places, one is not for discussion (so you judge them not worth talking to since that is damn near the goal of the sub, no discussion from outsiders) and one is for discussion.\n\nI still maintain that your evidence shows my point clearly, that the reason you can't talk to the *people* on the donald is because you are trying to do it *on* the donald.\n\nIf you tried to talk to me there, it wouldn't work, I would not engage like I do here on neutral (lol neutral) territory.\n\nI think if there was a place here for some real political discussion that allowed both sides to talk evenly you would find a *lot* of people on the donald worth talking to.\n\nSo, we don't disagree on any facts it seems. We disagree on the conclusion but I bet what I am saying is not so offensive you think it doesn't belong in the conversation. Do you think that?\n\nFeel free to continue on this topic or any other you have questions about or statements you want me to hear.\n\nMy point still stands and I find it more and more true every day.\n\nReddit is failing the conversation, *not* the donald.\n\nHaving the expectation to converse there is unreasonable, there are plenty of good subs *dedicated* to the conversation.\n\nYou have given one reason why you don't want to allow that conversation to happen (the quality of discussion on the donald). I think you are wrong. We don't need to insult each other to talk and we don't need to stop each other from talking. Thanks for helping me show that.\n\nOpen your mind to the possibility that everyone on the donald might converse like me, if you give them room.\n\nI hope you notice that many of the comments and down votes and insults tossed at me here might make the conversation tough for others to handle, I am not as thin skinned though so I can handle it. Not all of them can, not all of them want to.\n\nWe have two choices, find a way to talk, or find a way to ignore.\n\nIgnoring tens of millions, maybe even close to 100 million Americans is a bad idea if you ask me. \n\nIt might lead to them voting for a bad choice for president or something . . .
I was quoting you. . . wtf\n\nEdit: and no I still don't agree with your black and white absolutism. 
Thanks for your reply, your two posts combined create a realistic and informative view on the subject.
I am here to make a point, you are currently making it for me. That is why I am replying, but again don't worry about what I am doing, worry about you.\n\nMy current point you are proving.\n\nYour conversational boundaries are too small for a real discussion with anyone you don't agree with.\n\nYou already said that yourself pretty clearly, what I say is less important to you than how i say it and you get to know what I am going to say before I say it and judge it without discussion as wrong.\n\nYou are the problem here, my tone doesn't stop the discussion, you do.\n\nFeel free to pick a real topic and see where we stand.
Don't forget Carlos!
Yeah but it isn't like an individual has to pay for all that. 
What about us "anybody but Hillary" types? How dangerous are we?

Sorry about slow reply took a while to find the right video to send. https://youtu.be/pmpG97mGZhY My point isn't so much that we should believe what Murray says but that we have no reason to believe what the NSA, FBI, CIA and GCHQ are saying. Though certainly he has very little reason to lie whereas they have very many. With no evidence  there is no good reason to believe them.
Yeah everyone has a good bit of advice for how I present myself, for where I present myself, about how I look like a victim, about my circular argument, about every other damn thing about me...\n\nNone of you seem to notice that you are in fact making my point continually. You are focusing on *anything* but the actual conversation.\n\nI don't give a shit how you think I should talk. I give a shit about if *you* can talk on topic. You fail, almost all of you fail.\n\nA few got somewhere, those that engaged on the actual subjects that are relevant that is, not those who focused on *me*.\n\nYou talk like who I am matters, then when I reply and explain you all get it wrong and tell me I am playing victim.\n\nDrop everything about me and I assure I will as well, I didn't start talking about me. I don't want to continue talking about me, why the fuck do you?\n\nYour last line is exactly the problem and you can't even see it.\n\n"it's not dwelling on the story you told. it's dwelling on the way you told it."\n\n- why on earth would you dwell on the way I told it? Are you that sensitive? Do I need different tones and language for you to be able to handle it?\n\nThis isn't about me and I am doing everything I can to stop it from being about me. You just find me soooo interesting I guess you can't stop talking about me though instead of US politics. Now I agree I am important but I thought I was important like everyone is important, but your focus on me is starting to make me think I might be *really special*. Is that your point?
You have no idea what I agree with or don't, we are not that far in the conversation where you would hear what I think.\n\nLet's test your theory I will tell you and you tell me how much you think I hate democrats.\n\nI am for abortion.\n\nI am an atheist.\n\nI typically hate republicans.\n\nI typically don't agree with democrats\n\nI think equality is good.\n\nI think feminism has lost relevancy in the west compared to the issues my mothers generation spoke about fought for, and won.\n\nI think there should be election reform.\n\nI am pro pot.\n\nI am for very loose but legal immigration.\n\nI love multiculturalism and live in a town with 60 percent first generation immigrants and the best part is all the variety of food. \n\nI am not a Trump supporter. (I am a the donald supporter)\n\nI hate both Clintons. \n\nI think Obama was over rated and lied a lot more than was discussed. I think he will be our best ex president ever.\n\nI would love to see a female president, anybody but Hillary.\n\nI think the political dialogue is off topic usually and when it is on topic it is usually the wrong slant, when it is on topic and the correct slant it becomes jokes. Anything to avoid really talking (speaking about media here)\n\nI would like to audit the fed.\n\nI am for tariffs and trade taxation, we should charge people to get into the best market in the world.\n\nI think 9/11 has some serious flaws in the investigation, I have no idea who was behind it but I wish there was a real conversation about that, ever.\n\nI think gerrymandering was created by democrats and as usual once created it is used against the creators far more effectively, so BE CAREFUL giving out power.\n\nI think the power of the government should be more balanced towards the bottom end, municipalities/counties/ states instead of federal level power.\n\nI think corporate personhood is a crime.\n\nI think voting machines are deliberately able to be rigged.\n\nI think we should establish a more direct democracy and move away from representative democracy, the internet can help us do that.\n\nI am for citizens having guns.\n\nI am against Obama care but only because it didn't go far enough. Americans pay more than Canadians per person already without having the same benefits (comprehensive universal benefits) The health for profit industry should be gutted.\n\n\nWant me to continue or is it obvious yet we barely disagree *at all* and you can't even see it?
I have that one too, well my nephew currently does but he will give it back one day.
Yeah, so you keep talking about me over and over and over along with the rest of them. Even if I tell you you are wrong, still this is what you want to talk about. Me.\n\nI am using example and analogies, some have to do with me some don't I am also using other tactics but all you see is that one thing huh?\n\nSeems like *you* are the one who wants to keep the focus on me no matter how often I try to make it about something else.\n\nYou, like everyone else here, seem threatened by me and reactive, but talking about that has no value. Similarly talking about me has no value except when I use personal experience to express an idea, but you dwelling on the fact I used a personal story instead of addressing the points.\n\nI dunno, I guess I am just that important to you?
It isn't irony it is deliberate, want to talk about that point or just mock me for making it?
Yup agree with everything.\n\nIncluding that this doesn't do *much* but it does do *something*.\n\nLet me know what you think of Century of Self if you like.\n\nI am not even that conservative, I am *all over* the political scale and identify with no single group and never have. I suspect we agree on almost every fact, most conclusions when we get down to enough detail and that which we don't agree on is so small we can be effective with the rest without ever touching on those subjects.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if real politics was like that?\n\nThe reason it isn't is deliberate, but I will leave "Century of Self" to explain more of what I mean by that.\n\n
Obama promised we would, he didn't.\n\nTrump didn't even promise, what do you think the chances of it happening is?
Let me know when you will stick to something long enough to discuss it.\n\nHollywood parties with very young boys, of course that isn't ok. So are you saying that everyone at all of those parties in Hollywood where that happened is a pedophile?\n\nAre you aware of how many people in Hollywood that is?\n\nWhy single out the *one* guy willing to talk about it and call him out?\n\n
I would take Camacho over Hillary, clearly Camacho would have swept the elections!
You technically are driving, you are just using software of your choice to do it.\n\nWhat you are saying it sort of like saying "I am not making the car move, the engine is" as an excuse for hitting something.
First you claim they revere a violent uprising, then you link a poll about a flag.\n\nOne is not the other. \n\nShow me the poll where over half revere a violent uprising, those words in the poll.\n\nYour link proved you wrong, not right on your original claim sir and or madam.
You said "you need" twice, you should have said it 3 times.
Yeah so when you say A and I say B you just repeat A.\n\nThis is not a discussion.\n\nYou are very very sure of yourself on the topic of me i must say. \n\nStill proving me right in my claim that very few of you are interested in talking past your echo chambers.
That was actually pretty funny worth the watch.
You are missing pretty much everything I am saying, you hear the words but you just think I am "playing" victim. \n\nI am not, I am pointing out the fact that reddit is systematically eliminating the ability to speak to each other about that which we do not agree.\n\nCurrently I *cannot* answer you from the total downvotes I am now on a spam filter. I am not claiming to be silenced to be a victim or to make a point but rather to point out a reality that is happening to *all of us here*.\n\nYou just keep thinking everything I am saying is about me, it isn't I am just using me as the best, most recent example of what I am saying. Everything I claim about me is *also true about you* if we merely change subreddits.\n\nThere is NO PLACE TO GO TO TALK here on reddit. No matter where we go either me or you get crushed with downvotes and eventually run into built in reddit rules that means you cant talk at all, like me here now.\n\nThere is a problem and the donald is a symptom I agree, I also agree they are the most obvious symptom of the problem, but I also see it *everywhere* on reddit, do you?
Good analysis but Trudeau looks down at the ground then back up quickly, thus breaking eye contact first.\n\nI remember a breakdown of handshakes about Clinton. He was a master a rock, paper, handshake.
Yeah and one of Milos comments was it is not accurate to define pedophile as we currently do, it is merely legally expedient.\n\nThen you conflate legally expedient with a morality stance that is unsupported. \n\n*Then* you take this already assumed point which I don't agree with and you won't engage on and make a further point that anyone *near* that behavior is automatically a pedophile.\n\nYou are running a long way with no pants on . . . come back and lets talk a bit more slowly with less assumptions and attacks on your part please.\n\nFirst what is a pedophile, then  everything else.\n\nOne step at a time please.\n\nClearly everyone at that party is not proven to be a pedophile or an apologist, you have run yourself so far from reality you are being ridiculous at this point.\n\nEdit: I didn't say he was wrong, I said they were "bad enough". You are having a lot of trouble with assumptions I caution you to make fewer of them.
If you have a good PS2 you can play all those as well.
Please no.
Yup this whole story is all kinds of stupid.
King Rat is a book about that exact thing by James Clavell (who wrote Shogun and Tai Pan)\n\nGood book and much shorter than the other two I mentioned.

If he was being legally abusive they could have removed him.\n\nYou got fooled. The reality is the"he hurt her feelings" level abusive guy got thrown out of his own house because you like a girl.\n\nStay out of it next time and let the law handle it. You easily could have ended up in jail for this.
He didn't say he liked underage boys, he said as an underage boy he liked older men.\n\nHe also said that the age laws are about right but that humanity is not so rigid and as a result some legally underage boys actually are capable of consent, like himself at 14.\n\nHe likes big black cock, not young boy cock. Get your hate right son, we can't have you hating for the wrong reasons. 
You better take a whole day off to answer questions from the looks of things.

That's not a measure of popularity, If you look at the electorate as a whole you can see that as a percentage less people approved of and voted for her than any candidate before. So many people didn't vote at all the candidates were so unpopular.\n

That doesn't make her popular , You're basing that conclusion on faulty logic the population has grown and less people are voting:\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-weldon/two-thumbs-down-2016-pres_b_10219840.html\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-viewed-unfavorably-by-majority-cbsnyt-poll/
You finally realised 
Hey, Runescape's graphics are bad but not that bad.
There is a MASSIVE difference between democratic centralism (that is having your own opinions and still following the party line) and what Clinton was talking about. When she has a public position it is to appeal to votes and private one that is bend over to corporate interests that is two-faced and corrupt. Negotiation positions don't even come into it they are always public. Unless she is negotiating behind closed doors that would be corruption also.
Not really that relevant here, we'd need some more relevant charts. Though some of these would obviously look very different if capitalism had ended sooner.

Welcome to Capitalism.
Ha, that's the funniest thing I've read in a long time. You realise Clinton was one of the most unpopular presidential candidates in history right?
Nothing to do with the republican party they don't come into it. We need both sides exposed Democratic and Trump Administration. Expose one without exposing the other won't help.\nAnd by establishment I the Establishment.
When intelligence agencies tell us to believe them when they have a history of lying and provide no evidence then we should not trust them. IT is literally their job to lie there is even direct evidence to the contrary of what they are saying.
Why'd ya copy paste my comment and out of context?
They sold out,  how would people understanding that be any better for them?
Even if they leave the UK they'll still be British. Even people in Southern Ireland are technically British in that live in the British Isles, it is contentious there and in Northern Ireland though as many reject the idea of Britishness as coming from an English effort to homogeneous the cultures of the Isles.
The other commenters might be downvoting but I at least know you are correct. They do have the means just not the will it's ideology clouding them not you.
Exactly they seem to think they've got some sort of gotcha here when really they are basing their conclusion on very faulty logic.
I hope this is only a temporary measure.

This is going to look great in your comment history.
I already outlined why in my first reply to you. Even if those weren't the reasons we still know these agencies have a history of lying so there is literally no reason to believe them. The amount of discussion there is in the media about this show the media and the agencies are trying to push a particular narrative.

OK I'll admit I'm wrong on actually voting for her but your dead wrong on approved of her.\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-weldon/two-thumbs-down-2016-pres_b_10219840.html\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/22/politics/2016-election-poll-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/index.html\n\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-viewed-unfavorably-by-majority-cbsnyt-poll/\n\nShe is ridiculously unpopular, when she campaigned she actually went DOWN in polls in places she did that's practically unheard of. Don't delude yourself into thinking Clinton is in any way popular she is vilified by both left and right and many ordinary people.
Surprised you hadn't heard much, I guess if you don't get The Echo there's not that much in the way info spread around other than word of mouth and the internet.

The benefit is huge, if they can keep the narrative away from Hilary and democratic party failings they can keep the establishment in power rather see populist candidates take over the party. That is what they are scared of.

I'm familiar with what you're referring to, but someone submitted a FOIA request I believe to the Washington DC police and they didn't have records of an investigation.  Soo.. doesn't sound like a very thorough and transparent investigation to me.
that's fair, i'm not going to hold adele to a different standard.\n\non the other hand, as a fan of aphex twin and electronic music, my favorite artists are often completely in charge of sound design, song writing, sound design, and packaging.  i know this isn't a fair standard for pop musicians, but i do get annoyed when people think beyonce is a genius, but then some of the same people will denigrate electronic musicians saying "all they do is press buttons"

And get started on writing legislation that enacts your agenda.
Donald is exposing liberal hypocrisy like no other.  Let the dems think that this is an effective strategy, maybe they'll some day realize that a much better strategy would be to act in a principled manner.  \n\nIf dems collectively (somehow) acted respectfully throughout the next 4-8 years, then it would be a much more powerful statement than "rape Melania", or "fuck Drumpf".
a transparent investigation that publicizes its' findings.
honestly, i think a lot of the people interested in draining the swamp are less interested in a few specific cabinet positions and more interested in a paradigm shift to oust career politicians within both parties (like mcconnell, ryan, mccain, the clintons, diane feinstein, etc.).\n\ni'm not here to defend that position, that's just my opinion on the whole "drain the swamp" idea as it pertains to cabinet appointments like devos and tillerson.\n\nedit:  added the "etc."
Lol this was a few years ago before the election cycle, and I don't think they had any bumper sticker(s) at that time
Thanks.
I'm going to reuse my reply to someone else:\n\nRegarding a link, I'm on mobile but look up Gary Webb, mena, Arkansas, and you should find plenty of info.  Gary Webb is the reporter who broke he story, so you can probably still find his original article.  He was discredited and probably killed (he died through a suspicious "suicide") for this story, but eventually the CIA actually admitted to more of this operation than what Gary himself originally found.\n\nFor a very basic summary, under Reagan, the CIA operated and facilitated the smuggling of cocaine into America (through Mena) to finance covert ops in Central America to destabilize Nicaragua.  The smuggling operation was huge, and was a huge player in the LA crack scene, which destroyed the lives of so many.  It also tied into the Iran / Contra scandal hat you might be familiar with.
Congrats!  What are some of the applications of this within music-making?
I get that, I think it's a misnomer for what I mean though. Counseling is more accurate. 
i was wondering about this, and then i saw that this story is entirely based upon the testimony of unnamed sources.
haha just what i was thinking.
To be fair, it wouldn't have been much different if Hillary had won.  That said, I'm glad Bernie hasn't been quiet since the election.  If only...
the meme magic is strengthening
actually, in this thread, i don't see any mention of adele until your post.  i think we're simply discussing beyonce's celebrity and legacy in this thread, so perhaps you're mistaken..
Yuri Bezmenov, a defected KGB agent said in an interview in the '80s that only a small part of his job was the type of work glorified in James Bond movies.  The bulk of heir work was to shape ideas, attitudes, and people through soft means such as control over the media and news.
It was intentional
Yes but you can leave the govt once you're ready and get a sweet sweet lobbying gig based on all those working relationships you cultivated as a politician.
How is this humorous?
I'm glad you feel that way; I feel similarly.  A lot of my friends look at me crazy when I say that I think she was more dangerous to the country in some ways, only to find out they have no knowledge of how our activities in Syria was pushing toward a direct war with Russia.
i'd really like to know how this person is dealing with the fact that they're now a beloved conservative meme

i dunno, after continuing to follow the story over at voat, i think there's a lot of reasonable discussion and evidence.  i just think that this is one of those situations where it's hard for normal people to fathom how twisted and dark these people are.
And me
OoOOOhHh... my feelings!
Yes!  
I'm pretty sure Nancy Pelosi herself said during the presidential campaign that Hillary would pass the TPP.
I recently discovered a feminist named Camille Paglia, and to me she was interesting because she provided an interesting perspective on her take on the male mind.  She wrote a pretty successful book called Sexual Personae (she got her start as a professor in Art History) where she puts forth the hypothesis that the male mind is actually biologically different than the female's mind.  Specifically, she was fascinated by her observation that men seemed to have an ability to focus intently upon something, sometimes to their own success or demise (like with artists or serial killers).\n\nAnyway, I bring this up just because as an electronic music producer myself (another field generally dominated by men and which requires a lot of time spent focusing), I have wondered about why it seems to appeal to men more easily to women, and happened across her work, and felt like it was an interesting take.  So, you might find it interesting to look into her work just based on this post alone.
I voted for Bernie in the primaries, and would have done so in the general as well.  So yeah, there's no need for sarcasm, I genuinely want these people to get traction on making the country a better place for themselves and everyone else.
intelligence community
I agree; I was just wondering out loud to see what other people think.
As someone who thinks there's something there within the whole pizzag8 situation, the people screaming "pedo enabler!" to anyone expressing skepticism gets to me too.  \n\nWith that said, I do think there's some quality discourse there that's hard to find anywhere else, even if you have to deal with some stuff like you described.

somebody should try to follow them and report back with details
What the fuck Richard?!
If you look back into history, you'll know that the intelligence community regularly lies to the American people to achieve an end.  That's why it's the right thing to push for real evidence (which hasn't happened yet).  Look at what happened with blaming Syrian terror attacks on Libya in the 80s, look what happened in the gulf of Tonkin to start the Vietnam war, look what happened to lead up to the Iraq war, look at what Gary Webb exposed in the '90s...\n\nPizzagate though?  Plenty of compelling circumstantial evidence though no proof yet.  Would you like for me to find a summary?  There's a few different ones floating around that aren't too bad.
Sorry, no can do.  This site is as much mine to use as yours.  Thanks for the feedback!

the day when marijuana is no longer illegal and stigmatized in this country will be a beautiful day.  not only will it take a huge burden off of our judicial and penal systems, it would be a boon for our economy, destroy the cartels who run the black market operations, and would help improve inner city conditions.  i can understand if you personally look down on it, but in terms of america as a system, it needs to be legalized.
Aha, gotcha.  Spirit cooking seems like it did some damage, so perhaps that's why a few people were pushing it so hard, but yeah, it didn't do a lot of good for sensible discussion.

Funny you mention that, John Podesta is a long time friend of convicted pedophile and former speaker of the house Dennis Hastert.  When Dennis got nabbed by police, John even joked about how he should run away to Japan, instead of, yknow, expressing disgust that his longtime friend is a kid-diddler
thanks!
That part comes around ten minutes, for those who are interested.
This is the angle that should be employed in attempting to persuade people away from this sort of thing.
on top of that, archive websites like sli.mg have been selectively deleting pizzagate archived evidence.  there's definitely something going on here.
Just like all the bots who voted for him too, right?

Please leave politics out of /r/aww
Adam Curtis made some great documentaries covering middle eastern history for the BBC and I highly recommend checking them out
I think what they're saying is that within our rapidly shifting political spectrum, people like this make them feel disillusioned from the left, which is exactly the case for me.  I haven't changed my values, but I don't really feel at home considering myself a liberal anymore.  I consider myself an independent now.
Nice post!  It's really original and hilarious that you refer to people you don't know at all as garbage.  *I bet you're a riot at parties!*
Well, [when she wanted ducks on the ground, they got ducks on the ground.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEQvsK5w-jY)

It seems like they're almost the most upset that you're being nice and not taking their bait :)
good for her
It's even gotten into /r/aww which should be the one sub that's completely free of politics.  Come on Reddit, that's one sub where we should be able to set aside our differences and enjoy cute animals.
It truly is a shame how John Lewis treated Bernie during the primaries.  I guess that's politics, though.
And the point of this subreddit is?  To make fun of Donald for his weight?  \n\nYou realize you're just getting into the mud with him in using these tactics, and I'm not confident that we want to normalize fat-shaming within our political discourse.
i don't think this is supposed to be funny, though.  i think it's just for the sake of entertainment.
I would agree had lebron not come back, but they were shitty and he came back and won a ring for the land, hard to not forgive him. Imo kd is worse by far because he left a top team. 
Read more about the charges and you'll see that the charges are politically motivated, and the supposed "victim" didnt want to press charges, and felt harassed by the police.  I'm all for accountability, but let's be real here:  this wouldn't be the first time a powerful government tried to take down a powerful political dissident using sex.
on paper beyonce might be comparable to michael jackson, but in reality, he far surpassed beyonce's talent, and was more original in the process.

I've heard that the story about the burning building is fake, but I haven't looked into it on my own.  I did read a lengthy article that painted him to be somewhat shortsighted as a politician, specifically in regards to his attempts to reform New Jerseys education system.  I didn't like him when he was a vocal Clinton supporter, and I don't like him the more I learn about him.
As much as that could feel satisfying, it'd only reinforce the (false) idea that Bernie supporters are violent.
fuck yeah
There was a lot of content for this sub within her campaign.
Other laws do though, like the ones that make it illegal to physically attack another person.
Seems like it.
In spite of him having made the promise to do so early in the primary cycle, I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to switch from campaigning against Hillary to supporting her, especially with Jill Stein offering to take over the Green Party's ticket.
Fuck yeah
Lol.  Browsing /r/all and commenting sarcastically on a post before bed must mean that I'm sO TrIgGeRrEd.  Cheers!
Why would people just throw their signs on the ground when they're done?  It's not like they're heavy.  Couldn't they hold onto them until they found a suitable place?  I think that's the point that people are trying to make here.
other threads in this post discuss that, but i'm pretty sure that was all left out of this particular thread.\n\nedit:  the original post and this thread are both about critiquing beyonce's status and adulation in mainstream media.
Or, perhaps, freedom of speech in action.
good point--his style certainly doesn't make him very endearing to most people.  i'm sure that's a big reason why obama got a pass on so many things.
With torture having happened under both Bush and Obama, do you think that things would be different with HRC in power?  \n\nI know it's a moot point since she lost, but I wonder since it seems like people are judging Trump harshly for things that other presidents have done without much criticism.
Sorry for not being clear, I actually support the march, I just get disappointed when I see this behavior.  It's extremely common here in Baltimore and I hate it when it happens here as well.
It is, they made it too thick and took it out too soon.

i feel like i'm drowning in koolaid after reading just a few of the top comments.  "he seems like a good man!"  "george w bush seems like a great guy!"
In [this email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488), Tony Podesta (John's brother) refers to Hastert in a context that implies that they were friends for decades.
[There are govt operations to AstroTurf online](https://www.google.com/amp/boingboing.net/2011/03/17/us-military-launches.html/amp?client=safari)\n\nUnfortunately, the effect of programs like this and CTR is that honest people can get labeled as shills, but I wonder if infighting and divisiveness is an aim of these operations (like with Cointelpro)
"Like, like, like.."

It's happened to me, nbd. Didn't realize until after we were done but it did feel a lil different. That being said period sex is fine with me so for people who aren't okay with it it will obviously be different 
I will never not laugh at the dancing mom
Regarding a link, I'm on mobile but look up Gary Webb, mena, Arkansas, and you should find plenty of info.  Gary Webb is the reporter who broke he story, so you can probably still find his original article.  He was discredited and probably killed (he died through a suspicious "suicide") for this story, but eventually the CIA actually admitted to more of this operation than what Gary himself originally found.\n\nFor a very basic summary, under Reagan, the CIA operated and facilitated the smuggling of cocaine into America (through Mena) to finance covert ops in Central America to destabilize Nicaragua.  The smuggling operation was huge, and was a huge player in the LA crack scene, which destroyed the lives of so many.  It also tied into the Iran / Contra scandal hat you might be familiar with.
then i would be happy.  i don't want this all to be true, but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that, when considered as a whole, warrants investigation, IMO.
don't worry--lots of other pedes are out there viewing this material as well.  we have strength in numbers.
No, he clearly said they had doubts about his story, which is precisely why they asked him onto the show.
with how much of her latest work coming from the hands of many other producers, writers, and designers, i'm left wondering exactly how much of "her" legacy is really hers, and furthermore, how much of it she would've been able to make if she didn't look the part of pop idol so completely.
Good!  Good!  Let the hate flow through you!\n\n... and it seems I've been banned.  Cheers and thanks for the memories!
If you know her, ask her if she wants to go out for a drink sometime over text or something. Don't hit on her at work, that's not comfortable for her. 
Museums are perfect second dates because you already are somewhat comfortable so you don't necessarily need social lubrication (like alcohol, weed, or other people)
At least two of those are things that pretty much every person should be considering. 
Holy lord. Ozil won more tackles than Coquelin today. He also didn't concede 5 goals from the front. Holy shit.

Ok you just want to play magic. 
Because A) everyone should be in the gym at least to some degree. Beyond just strength, exercising regularly gives you insane benefits to mental health, and helps out in all areas of life. And B) you go to a doctor for checkups, right? Why wouldnt you do the same for your mind?

The McCircles have definitely slowed down, my favorite thing about his improvement 
You're right generally, but not being BBB accredited will keep most banks from dealing with them which can be a huge issue if it's franchised, and only that location is restricted from using the bank, they'll sooner fire the offenders and attempt to make amends with the victim
Is everyone seeing this shit? Wtf mascots
I don't think he's the first name on the team sheet here, and I agree he has serious weaknesses. I just believe that Wenger doesn't push him and a new manager that can is more valuable than selling him for 50m
I think he went to pass and realized his arms were horizontal and over Delly and was like shit I should probably shoot 
Nah I really disagree. You should be able to tell if your opponent will be running double fireball, or leroy cold blood x2, direct damage is important to a healthy game. Otherwise literally every deck would be tempo. 
I know this isn't what you were talking about, but girls (and guys if you're not a heterosexual male) love dogs and they're great conversation starters. 
Best part is according to him, it's because he's been taking naps before games and decided to try not doing that, and he's been balling out since 
Wondo has always been great for his club, for a while USA didn't have a ton of options, and after his miss in the WC against Belgium it was clear he had no confidence playing in the USA shirt, I remember him saying so himself 
Go meet her cat and every time she does it from now on you can just be like "omg I know it's adorable" 
Yeah some of these feel a little forced, but some are really good. I'd like to add "what do you daydream about?" every time I've asked a girl this I've gotten a really interesting answer, and its an endearing question because it shows you're really thinking about them 
I can understand that, but renolock exists with the combo finisher and its good. I do agree combo isn't strong right now though 
The emotional intimacy with a woman is different than with a man. (socialisation-wise, I've never dated a trans/fluid/nonbinary person so I can't speak on that.) \n\n\n\nPhysically speaking, everything that's been said, plus it feels right to hold a woman. 
How is priest hardly relevant? Dragon priest is definitely tier 1?
I've been wenger in for a long time, but at this point I think it's the best time. He's not getting further, and the longer he waits the more his legacy will be tarnished, and he deserves to be seen as a legend. 
>bleed through the pigment and leak on the sheet on the tablet on my mind cuz I don't write shit cuz I don't got time \n\n\n\nTbf the verse is hot, it's a jarring line but it fits
Of course, but it's pretty obvious the guy who wrote that hates every good deck he plays against. You can lose to good decks without them being antifun. 
So.. Jade isn't fun, pirate isn't fun, renolock isn't fun, dragon priest isn't fun. I'm starting to think the people on this forum don't understand the difference between being broken and just not liking to lose 
Sure, but literally every win (maybe not Portland I don't remember one from there), the other team's fans want to blow it up. Maybe we're just finding our identity (and naps were holding us back)
He lost big in a rigged election. The DNC and superdelegates handed it to trump. 
Not really interested in the team, in soccer the owner has a lot more responsibility, they play a part in financing the club, and Kroenke doesn't care about the team winning at all, he's just looking to make a buck. For comparison, Roman Abromovich bought Chelsea and took them from a decent team to a Champions League winner and PL titan
>gay for the Greek freak 
I get some people have diseases that affect weight and that sucks. But most people who are overweight don't. I agree with what the commenter said (although not how he said it.) I'm attracted to in shape women because it tells me they take care of themselves, and as someone who also exercises regularly it is a positive for me. Not every overweight person doesn't take care of themselves, but every in shape person does. I think that makes sense but I may be being unclear 
Hnnnng
Nah, Gym and Counseling. Easily the two most productive changes I've made in the past year or two
Validation, I really don't talk to any of the girls I match with outside of fucking around with obvious bot accounts and the occasional out-of-my-league match, who I just enjoy flirting with for a bit but not meeting up with 
Nah that's totally fine and not even abnormal in a bowl. 
Then you can't play hearthstone and expect to have fun. Or any card game. You're complaining, literally, about the resource of tempo. Playing the strongest minion every turn is a resource. That's 1/3 of the resources in the game. 
I hope so, but melo is melo man, hopefully he'll be okay with being a role player. I don't know if I can see that 
I mean you can usually tell conversationally, but if you mean interested beyond flirting, I'll go to the bathroom or something and touch her arm or shoulder or back or something as I pass, and every girl that has ended up being seriously interested has initiated contact at some point after I return. Then it's the game of little contacts back and forth until ya get outta there
Not right now, at the end of the season. I should have been clearer
Kings gave away a superstar for a decent young guy. They're going to lose. A lot. We get whichever pick is highest between us and them this year, and 2019 we just get their pick. It's fucking awesome for us, fucking unrealistically amazing for NOLA, and fucking depressing for Kings fans
>past 35 year old mustafi yelling at somehow 22 year old bellerin \n\n\n"mustafi is young mate Koscielny was poor when he started here too"
Eh I see your point, but in your analogy going to gym by yourself and self reflection are parallel. I get that, but just up band going to the gym can be dangerous because if your form is off you'll hurt yourself. Similarly, not every self reflection someone does is healthy
My #1 pick by far is Max Allegri. He could definitely bring talent over that would alleviate the wenger-players leaving, and would possibly help Alexis stay if the Juventus rumors are true 
I definitely disagree, because the Cavs weren't close to a ring, and OKC literally would have been in the finals if KD didn't iso and turnover 4 times in the last 4 minutes of games 5-7
What the fuck? If ozil goes to Germany he's going to bayern and starting every game. Not going to fucking Wolfsburg
What? They have to finish 9th and lose their group to be mad they lost someone they thought was a great player? (and they got fucking bale this is Real Madrid, efficacy isnt in question)
Holy shit you're salty as fuck. Kroenke is an issue because there have been billionaires willing to buy the club and make offers above what Kroenke paid and have been refused. Also, just for you, we have the 14th net spend in the PL. Our money doesn't come from our owner, which is the way modern football works. Look at Bournemouth, Leicester. 
If you have clippers take the back and side down and maybe try to product the front up to at something? That's the best instant advice I can come up with, other than that go to a real barber tomorrow morning. 
That's exactly correct! 
You know how sometimes when people are in a relationship for a long time they start to get restless and break up with their SO, then quickly realize being single isnt getting laid whenever you want with no responsibility? \n\n\nThat's about to be Arsenal fans. \n\n\nBut at least we're not the Kings. 
LEFUCK YOU THERE'S 
Because I had been trying to hang out and she had rescheduled 6 or 7 times in a row and I randomly met a girl I ended up dating for a while, and I didn't know how to deal with it. Luckily she didn't hold it against me and we're on good terms. 
I'm in a similar situation. My last girlfriend (first real love) broke up with me a month ago while studying abroad, and until a few days ago I've been super beat up about it, until I was texting her (I know) to tell her I'd be here if she changed her mind (again, I know) and she said to not wait for her. At that point I just had a feeling of "I'm not doing this over and over, I've said what I need to say" and since then have really felt way more over it. I haven't been looking exactly but I met a girl at a party and we hit it off so there's a date coming up. Anyway, my anecdotal experience is that its just gonna come at some point. Don't force it, but when it happens move on. 
Well that's tough to say, obviously lebron man-moded through the finals but KD was arguably the reason OKC lost. If you get a chance, rewatch the 4th quarter of each game of the WCF and KD iso-ing and chucking up nothing while Steve is cutting under or russ has a path, there's a ton. And Pre-Decision there was no way in hell the cavs could get through the Celtics, so lebron went to Miami to beat them. What he didn't do was join the Celtics. 
I think the low pomp suits you nicely, I'd ride it out if you're not looking for change in particular 
See that's fine, but you can't complain then about other people playing it. The irony in this post is that its complaining that other people are playing decks that aren't fun for them to play against, while also complaining that fun is subjective. 
I feel this, but Elliot Rodger was fairly attractive. Like I'd probably consider hooking up with him if I met him in a club or something 
Whoa man. This guy must be a fucking scumbag. Sorry you had to deal with him, I hope you can eventually move past it 
Holy fucking shit Hinkie just keeps giving 
I mean if it's not Embiid it has to be Saric, right? Any rookies have multiple 20pt games? (actually asking) 
I feel you on the way it went down for Lebron. He definitely didn't do it smoothly, but KD trying to play it up like he had to do the right thing for himself was embarrassing imo. The right thing would have been to buckle down and recognize your faults, not go to the best regular-season team in history. It wasn't the hardest path, its going to join a team that was already in conversation for GOAT. 
Let me start by saying I agree. It is worth considering though that beyond Koscielny's strength as a defender, his best strength is keeping the back line organized. This is huge considering how notoriously poor at this ospina is. Mustafi taking over was awful (see 4th goal, literally gets ran past while he's busy shouting at Bellerin on the wing)
You lost 1 game with a tier 3-4 deck against the best deck in the format? Wow, cancel it all
First of all, they sound the same, so it's a good thing I'm typing and not talking out loud? What the fuck? \n\n\n\nAnd Gotze has been awful. Really bad form. Like I know people think Ozils current form is the worst a player could be but Gotze isn't even getting that many minutes anymore because he's been terrible. And Wolfsburg isn't a team that buys Kevin De Bruyne, they bought him as barely more than a youth product and sold him when he came good. If youre talking about teams that buy de Bruyne you're talking about City. 
Sixers fan, I'm really fucking sorry for you guys, holy shit. I'm imagining Colangelo trading Embiid and I'd rather die. Y'all don't deserve this bullshit nobody would blame any of you for jumping ship 
Word, it's an interesting trend regardless, it's been slowing down as people are realizing we might be actually almost average instead of hot trash 
Pro tip: never take romantic hints from romantic movies.

Good calls. I haven't been watching the roty hunt much, just have seen Embiid and Saric ranked #1 and #2 on quite a few projections 
Alright... What? Xabi has like.. Always been known as that. He's the only relevant Xabi in football. And saying Xavi and Iniesta are the most iconic duo in modern history is a joke, right? And those are the players they sold off because they were too good for the clubs, you realize only Gotze, who has been shit this season, is still at one of those clubs right? 
If it was constitutional don't you think the group of individuals whose jobs are to do nothing but decide if things are constitutional for their entire life would have thought it was constitutional

Alright mate, just remember Spurs have taken more money from their owners than 17 pl clubs 
Honestly melo. Love the guy but the knicks aren't doing anything and I don't see someone like GSW or Cleveland taking him on. Maybe if he ends up with the rockets or Celtics and they make another huge move, but other than that it seems unfortunately realistic 
Agreed, but I don't think it's a bad character trait. Can't fault anyone for wanting to be a leader and being the star, and if it's about leaving New York I understand that as well

Agreed. I think it's managerial style, and Wengers doesn't work with Ozil imo. I love Wenger, but I hope he moves on and someone (Allegri optimally) pushes him back to top form 
I think he's ok. He'd be a good squad player. But the fact we seemed to pass on Kyrchowiak(sp?) and replied on Coq to start is not a good look. 
No. I'm not. If ozil goes to bayern he starts every game. There's literally no way in hell he goes to Wolfsburg. You remember he was one of Real Madrids best players and was only moved for Bale, and it pissed off CR7, Iniesta, Xabi because they all felt they couldn't replace his passing? He's a world class player. Period.

Xabi Alonso isn't a Barcelona player, first of all. Fucking hell, hes playing against us in 10 minutes. Second of all, he hasn't been lukewarm, hes a facilitator. Hard to make waves teeing up Poldi. Last season he was one off of the PL assist record. You're absolutely nuts. He would be the best player on any of those teams.  
That's impressive, seems a lot of work to get done in that time 
Sci-Fi made a mini-series in the early 2000s that is actually really good. Special effects are a bit lackluster by today's standards, but the acting is great and it's very close to the book.
I was a needy malicious asshole in highschool. I was always socially awkward (incoming cliche "autism spectrum") but I was able, with time and effort to learn how to interact with people comfortably, but not before my understanding of human relationships caused a lot of hurt for myself and others who I cared about.\n\nI learned that fear can turn good people into spiteful manipulative fiends. I've learned never to let my emotions control me now. They are there when I went them, and in the appropriate amounts, and gone when they become a problem.

So what's the deep analysis of all that shit on your face.
The real problem with drastic raises to the minimum wage is it kicks all the people in the lower middle class down a bracket. Prices go up a little bit, and people making minimum wage make a bit more money. But then all the teachers and such that are making 35-40k a year don't get their wages increased since they were already making more than minimum wage, and everything suddenly becomes more expensive for them.\n\nSudden drastic jumps in minimum wage aren't the answer, you need more systemic reform to avoid more widespread problems.
Well *hmphs arrogantly* it is now believed that the pyramids were constructed by well paid professionals, with minimal use of slave labor. *struts away*
More a novella, but for me it was "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect." The first time I read it I was generally more conservative leaning regarding sexuality and violence, but this book broke me of that. It presents horrifying violence and grotesque things but it is all germane to the plot.\n\nThe plot follows one of the oldest women in an immortal human society, who has created a sport of finding inventive ways to die, knowing that she'll be revived immediately after.\n\nIn a broader sense though [SPOILERISH ALERT], I usually describe it as a story about a machine intelligence that learns how to die.\n\nYou can find the full text provided by the author here: http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopiidx.html

I mean the ACA did mostly just cause rates to go up for everyone.

I have a similar problem. I had something of a difficult sort of relationship in high school. I would say I'm over it but I just haven't really met anyone in the last few years that interests me, in spite of school and several jobs and social hobbies.\n\nI guess my approach to relationships is that I don't want to date just to date, if I want to be with someone, it's because I know them and I like them already, and no one has really made me feel like that.
I'm all for it being independent and public, but honestly I don't think there is any substance to it. No one has come forward yet with any sort of meaningful evidence. All we have is the assurances of Hillary and her friends that Russia is big and bad.

This is total bs. Yeah, an infamous politician who has been accused by pretty much everyone of rigging about every election ever has a personal vendetta against Hillary Clinton because she made comments about him fixing elections.\n\nThey haven't actually released any evidence or intelligence of any sort. All we have are a bunch of professional liars assuring the public on behalf of the rich and powerful that Russia is evil. This is nothing new but I'm surprised how much idiots are buying into it.

It's a variation on the chinese saying "The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."\n\nAnyways my version is this: I will start with what I CAN do, and work my way to what I MUST do.
"The most admired woman in the country..." Damn these fuckers are delusional.
Charitywatch and Charitynavigator are full of shit.
The really sad thing is that both sides aggressively suppress any dissent in their own ranks and from the other side. Independents get a lot of shit too (I have been banned from both r/The_Donald and r/EnoughTrumpSpam.) \n\nOn a positive note racism and prejudice is something I see almost nothing of in my life outside of the internet. I live in a majority hispanic town in Colorado and really everyone here gets along, regardless of race/gender/sexuality, etc.

When I visited Moscow I was not expecting the kilometers and kilometers of endless midrise apartment buildings. It was astounding.
If the Nazis had just delayed the invasion of the USSR long enough or Rommel to achieve decisive victory in Africa, they might have won.
Yup. Then they complain when the forest catches fire and burns their wooden house in the woods down.

A contributing factor to this is urbanization. More people are moving into the cities where space is at a premium and as a result prices are much higher. \n\nI live in a small city in Colorado and housing here is dirt cheap, but then again, no one really wants to live here because there are few good jobs.
Keep your hands off my gay!
Meanwhile in 'Murica my home town is majority hispanic. FEAR OUR SUPERIOR MEXICAN CUISINE!
This is just more of the same "take our word for it" shit with no evidence. Why is everyone acting like this is a big deal?

There's a small idealistic part of me that says true love can be had between any two people who actually want to make it work, but then a much louder part of me is saying "This is a great idea!"
The fact that you care enough to be worried is sign enough that you will be a good father.
I tend to agree with your second point, but Rommel's loss in Africa was largely due to supply and reinforcement problems, which were greatly exasperated by the invasion of Russia diverting resources away from Africa.

My Grandpa's turned our family ranch south of Westcliffe into a pseudo-wildlife preserve; it borders national forest and he and several neighbors have all prohibited/avoided hunting in the area for decades. Now its full of bear, deer, and turkey. \n\nOnly problem recently is Amish poachers, but they don't kill much.
This is probably gonna disappear in the comments but I went back to wikipedia to check on ol' Kony in 2014 and saw the US State Department was offering a five million dollar reward for him. \n\nThough to myself "I could use five million dollars" and bought a plane ticket to Uganda. Didn't get him though. Got stopped twice trying to cross into the DRC with no visa. Have a canceled exit visa from Uganda though. Went pub crawling in Manchester to celebrate my failure.

Not as bad as all the people pretending the antifa riots were much worse than they actually were and equating them with all the pro-fascist violence that's been going on the last month. 
To be fair, Netflix deserves some of the blame here. They clearly used that clip to be provocative and controversial. The movie that this show is based on is a fictional story and this scene makes perfect sense in the context of the story, but on it's own it just seems to be calling white people racist. 
I think there's a video on youtube. I imagine you could find it quickly by googling. 
Basically every time Buddhism comes to a new country it changes. There are many sects and they all differ in some way. So yes, Buddhism is challenged all the time, we just still call it Buddhism. 
Just because they're not billionaires doesn't mean they're not successful. Some careers just don't pay as much as others. We as a society place too much value on wealth. 
Oh shit I misread the title. Yeah, the .44 mag is way faster. 
Yeah but mining is a pretty shit job. OP could go to trade school and become a welder or electrician. Or just do the programming thing. However, the military isn't a bad option either. You do get a pretty generous pension even if you only do four years. 
Europeans fucked first cousins for thousands of years just like everybody else. Why do you think all the noble families across the continent were full of retards? 
I believe Musk recently announced that they are working on that and will begin supporting third party repair and maintenance. 
It was probably used as decoration in some rich guy's house and never saw use in combat. 
He is trying to make money, but that money is going to be used to start a Martian colony. Musk is pretty cash poor for someone worth as much as he is. He reinvents nearly everything. 
God damn you're stupid. I bet you have no idea how cringey this is. 
As a player, you could hire additional alchemists to speed it up potentially. 
>That it compares to the recent, far smaller crimes done against muslims and LGBTQ people, some of which were found out to be fake?\n\nOh yeah, six people shot to death in a mosque is a far smaller crime than a few Trump supporters getting beat up. 
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh shit. *That's* why people love The Sims so much. 
Actually, if you want your organs to be useful to others after your death, you should kill yourself next to a hospital while you're still fairly young. If you're too healthy, you'll live well into your 80s and your organs will probably be useless.

Of course not. I doubt they ha e a problem with Mike Pence. It's just Trump they want to get rid of. 
True, but Phoenix is also more than double the size of Las Vegas. 
Very unlikely. It's a hollow point round, so it loses velocity quickly once it enters a target. 
LOL, you've never been to any of those countries and have no idea what you're talking about. I'd feel much safer walking through a heavily Muslim neighborhood in Germany than through the average trailer park in the South. 
Even if they are poor and desperate, they can't be allowed to kill rhinos. 
I wasn't asking about the US. 
Yeah, the US military built something similar in the 60s.

Trump is a fucking retard. You need to get that through your dense skull. The man has absolutely no idea what he is doing, he spends nearly every waking moment watching TV and tweeting. 
My point is that it doesn't matter if she cares or not. If the judge cared because of personal involvement with the case, they'd have to recuse themselves. It's stupid to justify punishments based on how the victim's family feels. 
Phoenix, AZ is the epitome of human hubris. That city should not exist. If the water ever runs out, they're fucked. They don't even have seawater to desalinate. 
Yes, but a local government could potentially afford to set up a municipal solar program. Just because you can't afford to buy in yourself doesn't mean you can't have an impact. \n\nAlso, you know you don't have to buy the panels upfront right? You can just pay for the power. 
Says the Nazi. 
Who cares what they think? There's a reason we have impartial courts dole out punishments instead of the victim or their loved ones. 
Sure, certain assets, but they wouldn't work very well and they'd look like shit. You can't use the old models, and using the old textures with new models would suck.

Nice to see a big ten team show up for their bowl

I think fries are called chips in lots of places. I'm pretty sure the reason we call crisps chips here in the US is because we invented crisps, but at the time they were probably just seen as extra thin chips, so the old name stuck. 
Yeah, it's one thing to let him out, but IMO they should keep checking up on him to make sure he takes his meds. 
It doesn't seem like he was being sarcastic this time. 
It looks like this was hand-drawn from memory. 
Because Republicans don't want to get rid of the immigrants. They are the party that represents business and agriculture, they can't do anything that would upset their donors. They know that you can only practically deport a small number of people. The goal is to make it look like they're doing something without actually doing anything. 
Multi-seat districts would be great, and wouldn't even take a constitutional amendment to implement. 
They are definitely not the majority. They are just a vocal and well organized majority. 
Proof? 
I would argue it doesn't make sense to hate someone for the choices they make because free will is a fiction and we're all nothing more than flesh robots when you get down to it. 
Depends on your company IT policy 
I might too, but that doesn't change the fact that I think shooting them is justified. 
If the country had more infrastructure, there would be no excuse for extra judicial killings. However, when this is the only available technique that works, it has to be used. Better to kill suspected poachers on site than allow the rhinos to become extinct. 
Not really. It was a relatively minor fuck up. It sucks but these things happen. There was no need to spend that much time and energy on it. 
They might just keep adding range and power instead of lowering the price. 
Nope, that's NASA rockets. SpaceX, Russian rockets, and most others use kerosene. 
Jesus Christ, do even the name of extremely famous celebrities have to be blocked out? I was very confused at first. 
No, he defended grown men having sex with 13 year-olds and said consent was "oppressive". 
That's not what I meant by wealth. You don't need to be super rich to be financially secure.
It wasn't just about the Cold War. The Soviet team was considered to be the best in the world by a significant margin. Honestly, they probably were. It was in large part due to political mismanagement that they lost. The team got stuck with a bad coach due to nepotism and became disgruntled and demoralized. They probably would have won if they had their original coach. 
Maybe it was a hack that the programmers of the universe used to save on resources. Like how they reuse hosts on Westworld. Maybe there are only a handful of consciousnesses running everything, or maybe just one, but all their memories are kept separate. except when there's some sort of bug. 
That's pretty cool. I mean it's basically a shitty golf kart, but if you had production at scale you could potentially make it for far less than the $5000 estimated in the article. Not that anyone would want to drive it given that it has no suspension, but it's better than nothing I guess. 
It doesn't taste like beef. 
Dead bodies always consent 
They don't even have to have an outside relationship to have a conflict of interest. The more drugs are prohibited the more work they have an the less likely that funding will be cut. 
They could still have lunch they'd just have to split the check. 
It is a major obstacle, but I would argue that FPTP voting is bigger. Closed primaries and our crooked campaign finance system are also major obstacles. If we can tackle all four of these, we'd end up with a pretty good democratic system. 
No they wouldn't. They probably have a clause for what to do of the laws change. 
Don't get caught. If you do lie to get your foot in the door, I would try to find another job after a year or two and be totally truthful in that application. That way you only have to make it a little while without getting caught. 
He was institutionalized. The purpose of institutionalizing someone is to treat their illness, not lock them away forever. 
Late to the party but I always thought The Postman starting Kevin Kostner had an interesting setting, but it was just such a bad movie it ruined the potential 
Honestly, I would go so far as to say elections are the enemy of democracy. None of these things would even be issues if we switched to a sortition-based system. Elections are what cause democracies to devolve into oligarchies by encouraging the formation of a political class. \n\nObviously selection by lottery has drawbacks, but IMO they can be overcome. For example you might have a petition system to keep popular leaders around longer, or a qualification exam for certain committees, or a two-tiered system where candidates are selected from a randomly sampled pool by randomly sampled electors. Ireland selected 40% of the delegates to its 2012 constitutional convention by sortition, so it's not like it's some unheard of thing. 
Any mention of it is probably grounds for a ban. 
There is no other option here other than to allow the rhinos to die. Sometimes there's just no other way. It's true that the poachers are probably just trying to get get by, but that just means it's all the harder to get them to stop peacefully. 
Yes, but Pence is still generally a rational human being. Trump is mentally ill and is a threat to global safety. 
Neither party is dying. They're both undergoing internal shifts, but there probably isn't going to be a split or a new party. 
No, population. Phoenix has over 1.5 million in the city proper and around 3.2 million in the metro area. 
Now there's some kids who deserve a pizza party. \n\nEdit: I didn't mean the pizzagate conspiracy kind 
You know that mixed-race people have a lower incidence of genetic disease than people of only one ethnicity, right? It's called hybrid vigor. Your entire ideology is based on pseudo-scientific garbage. 
The Dems managed to pull it together in 2006. Maybe they'll do it again. 
That was a typo it was supposed to say reinvests. Anyway having your money in liquid investments like index funds isn't the same as having it all in the companies you run. If he started selling a lot of shares, investor confidence would plummet immediately and their value would drop through the floor. \n\nAlso, he seems like a pretty chill guy. I don't know why so many people think he's some kind of egomaniac supervillain. I mean Trey Parker likes him (they're friends) and he seems to be a pretty good judge of character. 
That simply cannot work. Middle class people need to pay too. The ultra-rich do not have nearly enough between them to fund society's needs. This is just math. 
In my state even a basic biology or chemistry degree will get you $20/hr or more. 
Not the trial itself, but in this case he would likely have been let off the hook if not for the protest. The protests are needed to counteract the corruption. 
Trump supporters aren't all bigots, but they are all retards. 
Activation of the cones isn't color. Activation of the color processing pathway of the brain is color. That's why we can dream or imagine things in color.

Please don't score OSU. Only way beck might possibly be fired. Absolute garbage performance And game plan
Eventually - it doesn't make sense for me economically at the moment, but I hope to in a few years 
I lived in Ohio and NC and drove a lot through surrounding states, the roads during snow/ice storms weren't very different. Ice is ice in the south and north.   And, salting and plowing is not going to stop a blizzard from screwing up roads terribly in the north. The depts of transportation only have so many plows and have to focus on vital routes and such first. It may be days before a lot of roads are plowed. \n\nDrivers were bad in both places, but it did seem as though a storm in nc would really screw traffic up a lot worse than in Ohio  I think it might be a function of the types of cars ppl tried to drive in snow down there - Rwd and bad weather do not mix  
OK!

 The numbers who voted for Obama just didn't show up to vote for Hillary. So, Trump is in office. If they were so anti Trump, they should have voted.

This is just embarrassing. 
Not sure about the conspiracy stroyline but they have definitely been off. I was actually hoping to not get picked and go to the rose or something. OSU just was not ready this year - too young

Not sure what you're doing now,  but maybe you could do a masters there? 
Auburn? 
OK. So from this question I am thinking you may not know much about grad school. ranking grad schools as a whole doesn't make any sense. For instance Michigan might have a better law school than Georgia tech but they sure as hell don't have a better com sci program. Ohio state has a vet school and Michigan doesnt does that mean they have a better English school? it's all about your professor your research  and what specialization you want and most of the top 10-15 programs rankings are pretty arbitrary.  \n\nDon't let your bias cloud your judgement

How long will you give California to exit before you give up and leave the US on your own accord and move to France or somewhere else like that? \n\nI'm asking because these types of over generalizations are just as bad as what you think everyone in the mid west and south does,  and we don't need that kind of bigotry on either side in this country 
Clemson but it won't be easy at all. Alabama isn't going to screw up  like Ohio state. 
Maybe they should have all shown up to vote in November 
Thank you for doing this AMA. I'm a working dad who is very interested in the program but also have a few questions. So, thanks ahead of time for any info you can give on the below. \n\nFirst, I'd like to know more about the flexibility of the program. For instance, in the OMSCS, I've read that a student can take as little as one class a semester or even take summers off if needed. Will the same level of flexibility apply to the analytics masters? \n\nSecond, do you have any timeline for when other tracts and/or classes will be added? \n\nFinally, if I finish the micromasters first and then decide to enroll in the full masters, will the credits apply from the micromasters courses? \n\nThanks again! \n\n

They are a lost cause, don't waste your time.
Oh yeah but there was no mention in the last paragraph about it being just about football powerhouses. Just that Michigan is pretty much the best public university. \n\nAnd just so u know. GT is a great school. And I don't think UNC is behind Michigan by much if at all. At that point it's pretty much all subjective isn't it?\n\nFinally when was the last time Michigan was that much of a greater program in football than UNC or GT?  15 years?  I definitely don't think they are on the same level as most of the schools mentioned.

 Not every road gets plowed and salted in the north - especially not a place like you describe.  The roads just stay blocked a lot of times until they thaw.   People just figure out ways to get around.

Gold's good
Touche.  I should have specified fresh human shit  oh well
Fine.  If this makes you feel better then Michigan is the best thing since sliced bread and grad school rankings aren't subjective at all. Rankings totally determine the worth of a school and everything to do with it. There are no other schools except the ones you say that even compare with Michigan in anything and Michigan is THE greatest premier football power. A law degree from Virginia and a computer science PhD from illinois are not even worth a Michigan man's time to wipe their ass with the diploma.  If one gets a degree from another public school, they might as well just burn it and then jump into oncoming traffic as they are just dog shit compared to anyone who ever doned a Michigan shirt. \n\nMichigan is like Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT rolled into one for academics. And they might as well be an NFL team in football because they are just such a power house and just keep winning division, conference and national titles over and over.  When I see someone wearing a Michigan shirt, then I know that they are better than me because I am not.  \n

However the US wouldn't face the same consequences as putting down a California secession would be a lot less of a reason for sanctions than just annexing a part of another country.

Might be interesting to look around the muddin spot on google earth sometime and see if there is anything weird out there  
Not true - UNC uva a number of UC schools plus GT and William and Mary all compare w Michigan. Plus Illinois and Wisconsin aren't too far behind if they are behind at all 
I've never heard of that. In my area you can join many credit unions just because you live in a certain geographic region. They just want you to open a saving with like $50.00 in it and you get free checking.
If you don't plan on going to college. You should think about going to night school and learning a trade like computer aided manufacturing, welding, electrician etc. You will make much better money and it won't be a budget buster like college.
That's why I said demand full restitution. If the son is running the mother's finances he can take the money he needs to make himself and his sister whole. Otherwise it is time for mommy to meet the PoPo.
After the final Episode of TOS "Turnabout Intruder". You may want to skip Star Trek: The Motion Picture (They don't call it the motionless picture for nothin') though some fans love it. Then the other Star Trek movies except for 5 which is awful Watch 6 The Undiscovered Country and then start TNG.
There is a sociopathy that runs through it seems a larger and larger portion of the 1%. Certainly the types in the Republican Party. If given their way they would destroy every social safety net. Those idiots will bring the revolution. 
If he tries to sell you an annuity run out the door.\n\nNote: He will try to sell you an annuity. Annuities are terrible investments.
You might want to look into Dave Ramsey for debt reduction help. His method in short is to cut everything to the bone until the debt is gone. He has a radio show, books and web site.\n\nhttp://www.daveramsey.com/get-started/debt?snid=tools.howtogetoutofdebt
If you have a high deductible health care plan you may qualify for an HSA.\n\nA 529 for your own return to school or your kid's college\n\nYou can open a traditional IRA but you are limited to $5,500 annual contribution between the traditional and Roth IRAs.\n\nOther than that the best option is a Taxable account at Vanguard in an index fund with low expenses, fees and turnover like VTSAX.

You could have your parents buy EE U.S. Saving Bonds for you. You could also put your money into Certificates of Deposit at a bank (You may need your parents to be co-owner with you) and you may be eligible for MyRA from the Treasury Department if you are working.\n\nTheir web sit is here: www.MyRA.gov.\n\nThe best thing to do now is read about investing and saving. I would recommend:\n\n"Common Sense of Mutual Funds" by John Bogle\n\n"A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel\n\n"Rich Dad/Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki (Just don't take any of his seminars or his advice about going deep into debt to buy real estate)\n\n"The Millionaire Mind" and "The Millionaire Next Door" by Robert J. Stanley\n\nIf you don't understand anything in those books just come back here and ask. There are plenty of smart people here that are more than willing to help you.
Probate fees will depend upon your local laws. A probate court will still have to approve the legitimacy of all those beneficiaries and publish notice of her death in a paper where any of creditors can see it an possibly attach the estate if they are owed money. You can try to navigate probate yourself but, you may wish you had an attorney to help you. An honest lawyer probably won't charge much more than $500.00 if everything is pretty much in order as you say.\n\n\nIf you are splitting 35K or less 4 ways and you're mother is already over 70 and 1/2 taking the lump sum is probably the way to go as beneficiary IRA's can be a hassle.
You are looking for the lowest expense ratio possible with no sales loads or 12b1 fees. If you put the ticker symbol for each fund in at Yahoo Fiance or Marketwatch.com they should give you all the info you need about the fund. \n\nRun you choices by the PF subreddit and you can get more advice about your choices.
If you aren't willing to walk away the Corporate Democrats will give the progressives nothing. "Fuck You where you gonna go!" has been the mantra of the Corporate Democrats since the Clinton years. If it means 2 more years of a Republican congress to for them to get the message then so be it. I mean I actually see early stirrings of the Corporate Democrats trying to run Hillary again. They just don't get it and will keep losing even to a buffoon like Trump until they actually do something for working people.
And then watch "Legend of the Rangers" and you'll never want to watch TV again.
I guess I did not look closely enough it does look like the C Fund did perform even a little better than the market. Sorry, my mistake.
Season 3 "The Enterprise Incident" and "Day of the Dove" are fun. There may be one more that's decent. The rest just aren't the same quality as the first two seasons but to each their own.
Really look at your budget and see where you can cut. You might want to look into the Dave Ramsey program. He does a good job on debt reduction but, I would not take any of his investment advice.
Try one of your local credit unions.
B5 would have been a better series than DS9 if they had the same budget. A real writer's room instead of JMS pumping out all the scripts , plus his other producer duties and more money for better actors and effects.

She was also affecting other actors performances. She was real low energy and you can see Tim Russ trying to dial it down so as not to upstage her and it effects his delivery.
Tell the sales person that you've changed your mind and no longer wish to invest. If they don't have access to your money it is going to be much harder for them to do anything, hopefully you haven't given them any bank transit or routing numbers. If they give you hard time you may need a lawyer. Threaten to report them to the SEC, the Treasury Department and your state's attorney general. \n\nCheck your contract for a "Cooling Off Period" You will have to act fast as they are very short.
Vanguard Mortgage VMBS \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VMBS/risk?p=VMBS\n\nThe expenses aren't bad. These are mortgage securities and if we have another bust like 2008 your cousin will probably get killed. If your cousin is interested in investing in mortgage backed securities then Vanguard Ginnie Mae (VFIJX) would probably be a better choice. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and are of the same credit quality as U.S. Treasuries.\n\nHighland IBOXX Senior Loans \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNLN/profile?p=SNLN\n\nPretty high expenses at .55% and somewhat low credit quality loans to highly leveraged business.\n\nIshares MSCI USMV\n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/USMV/profile?p=USMV\n\nIshares Microcap IWC\n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IWC/profile?p=IWC\n\nPowershares Dividends PDBC \n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PDBC/profile?p=PDBC\n\nLooks like a commodities fund. Generally speaking unless your are a very sophisticate investor it is best to stay away from commodities.\n\nIf this is in a taxable account your cousin is probably getting whacked pretty hard on taxes. This portfolio an has an unnecessary level of complexity and some of the funds have relatively high expeses. A three fund portfolio at Vanguard would probably be better especially if you cousin is in a taxable account.
You mean $60.00 dollars? Not $600 or $6000? If it really is $60.00 just close the account give Uncle Sam the $6.00 and call it a day.
Victoria on PBS is fantastic but, does not seem to get a lot of love around here. PBS only shows it once at 9 on Sunday and there is a lot of competition. \n\nThis Sunday PBS is doing a marathon of the entire series all day Sunday. \n\nSet your DVR's  or catch up on the PBS website. It really is superb.
It would be a stupid idea to buy a $40K car in any situation. Only if this was a heavy duty truck for you work would it be acceptable. \n\n\nDO NOT DO THIS!
Cars are not investments they are basic transportation and can be enormous money pits. \n\n\nFor someone in your circumstances what you want is commonly known as a "beater", that is an older car that is safe and reliable but, maybe isn't too pretty or the coolest thing on the block but, gets you around safely without breaking down constantly.\n\nTry buying from a private owner on Craigslist. You can get a "Carfax Report" on the car's history using the "VIN Number" (Vehicle Identification Number) which is located at the bottom of the windshield on the driver's side. This will tell you if the car is a "flood car" (avoid) or has ever been in a wreck (avoid). \n\n\nYou should also try to take the car to a trusted local mechanic or friend who knows cars and can spot any defects for you. \n\nYou are better off paying cash for a "beater" than incurring debt at such a young age.
Then you are operating from a "stepped-up basis" which means that your capital gains tax is only based on the capital gains from the date of your relative's death. The market went up pretty well last year but, if you are going to move the money this is probably he best time to do it. You'll pay some tax but probably won't get killed.\n\nThese articles may be of interest to you.\n\nhttp://www.kiplinger.com/article/taxes/T055-C001-S002-cost-basis-for-inherited-stock.html\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-the-basis-for-inherited-stock.aspx
It looks like most of them except the last 2 have hit their doubling point and are now paying you less than inflation. So sell those and pay the tax. If you haven't contributed for 2016 yet you have until April 15 to do so and then you can contribute for tax year 2017. \n\n\nYou should put your money into a Vanguard Index like Total Stock or SP500 inside your Roth.
I just watched that piece of shit. If that's the example they are using to justify "Women are Funny" they just lost the argument.
Why is the money being moved out of the 401K unless the choices are abysmal?\n\nIndexing is the best way to go. Just understand that not all index funds are created equal. The epense ratio should be below. .20% or even much lower. There should be no 12b1 fees on the funds and no sales loads. Ideally the money should be at Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab and be in total market or SP500 indexes.\n\nIs this planner a Certified Financial Planner? If not look elsewhere.
I may be affected by having a terrible crush on Jenna Coleman.
I would stick with Traditional if you convert to Roth you are going to have to pay tax. You can always open a Roth later. There is not requirement to contribute to an IRA. You can skip years if you want, though it is not recommended. Compounding is your most powerful ally in growing your investments. The more you save early the more time you money has to grow. \n\nIf you are torn between getting rid of your debt and funding your retirement really take a look at your budget. Can you make coffee at home and brown bag it for a year or two? Cut your cable. Do a "stay-cation" instead of going away for a couple of years? Ride public transit? Get a flip-phone instead of a smart phone with an expensive data plan? If you get a program like Quicken or Microsoft Money it helps you to really see where your money is going and how your investments are performing.
The odds that you are better stock picker than every professional on Wall Street who's full-time job is to beat the market and can't is very low. Buy the index.
Be sure the investments in your 401K and Roth have low expense ratios and no fees.
Yet.\n\nExtra words, extra words futurology requires extra words because being concise is not valued on the Futurology reddit so waste a little time reading extra words.
Do you know the 5 letter code for your SP 500 fund The one I found (STBIX) has very different expense ratios than what you are quoting.
Cheat a little and finish up with "Q Who" from season 2.
Subtract the fees from that Mid Cap and it may not look so good.
You feel like your getting a better value because you are getting more disks so they can charge you more.
Move it all to the Vanguard Target Retirement 2050. You've got a lot of overlap there.\n\n\nAfter the balance gets above 50K and if the funds are available you may be able to duplicate the mix with Admiral Shares of the same funds in the same proportions that Target Date 2050 uses at much lower expenses and re-balance yourself.\n\nTell your wife she needs to start contributing again at least up to the match if not the full 18K. You are giving away free money and a huge tax deduction.
You may want to ask yourself the following questions:\n\n- How long do I plan to stay in the area I currently live.\n\n- Where does the Real Estate Market and general economic conditions of the area seem to be going.\n\n\nI will give one caveat about owning a condo as apposed to a small house. I had a friend who purchased a condo in a declining neighborhood. In the early 1990s recession many of the condo owners abandoned their units and the condo fees went way up because they were spread between fewer and fewer owners.  Ultimately my friend declared bankruptcy and walked away from his unit too (admittedly there were some other factors with gambling and out of control spending). Just be aware that when you are buying a condo you are hitching you wagon to a number of other people that may not be as disciplined about their finances as you.\n\n\nYou may want to consider a very small house in a good neighborhood rather than a condo.
No but it helps.
Kiplinger publishes a guide at least once a year of the highest and lowest tax states. It really does not address income just what the most and least expensive states are.\n\nhttp://www.kiplinger.com/tool/taxes/T055-S001-kiplinger-tax-map/
S3 has a kind of interesting back story. NBC was ready to cancel the series and then a fan letter writing campaign saved it for season 3. Roddenberry was enthused about coming back for season 3 and then NBC scheduled the show Fridays at 10 which was considered the "Death Slot". Roddenberry pretty much knew the show was toast and turned the day-to-day show running to Fred Freiberger who would get the nick-name "The Series Killer". Fred Freiberger produced a lot of mediocre to bad episodes of Star Trek in season 3. However, without those Season 3 episodes Star Trek would not have had enough to sell into a syndication package and it was in syndication that Star Trek finally found an audience. So as bad as some of those episodes are without them there would be no 50 year history of Star Trek.
Look into the Dave Ramsey method to pay down your debt. \n\n\nYou mention "eating out" this has to stop until you deal with the debt. All luxuries have to go. Get rid of the expensive smart phone with a data plan and get a cheap flip phone, brown bag your lunch and cook at home. Cancel the cable and the Netflix (rent DVDs for free at the library) and cut every other cost you can think of below food, shelter and very basic transportation. You could be debt free in two years.
You could open a 6 month CD but the interest would be negligible, probably not enough to buy lunch at McDonalds. Just pay the school.
I looked at that fund and it was under performing the market. Are you talking about PSMKX?
In the future you will need to pay estimated taxes yourself throughout the year each quarter. You can download the payment slips at the IRS.gov website.
529 Education Accounts for you or your kids and HSAs.
You should switch those SP500 shares over to Admiral shares for significantly reduced expense ratio.
Interested to know what fund family your 401K is in and what funds. \n\n\nMany people lose the investment growth they deserve because of over priced mutual funds.
Time to cut back on the Wacky Tabacky
I don't know about that. .03% is lower than VTSAX which is just about the lowest there is. You really need to find out what the ticker symbol is. State Street isn't know for being a low cost company and the The State Street Funds I found with similar names had pretty high expenses.
Pay the student loans. The interest is higher and you can't discharge them in bankruptcy.
How quickly do you need the 15K? For ease of access a CD Ladder at a local credit union would work. Buy 5 $3,000.00 Certificates of Deposit for 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 Years and 5 Years. That way as interest rates rise (and the probably will rise) You will get to rollover at the new higher rates each year.
Open a Roth IRA at Vanguard. Contribute $5,000.00 for Tax year 2016 (If you haven't already done your taxes you have until April 15 to contribute for 2016) and $5,000.00 for tax year 2017. Put the entire amount into The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Admiral Shares (VTSAX) reinvest your dividends and let it ride. \n\n\nContribute $5,500 (Or whatever the max is as congress adjusts for inflation) every year. Don't panic during the inevitable pull backs and market crashes and when you reach retirement age you will be very rich indeed.
I would put as much as you can in Vanguard Institutional Index VINIX\n\nLooks like a very solid fund with low expenses.\n\nhttp://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/vinix
Voya plans are usually not good investments (Very Expensive). You would be better to reduce your contribution down to your company match. Open an Roth IRA at Vanguard and put in $5,500.00 for Tax year 2016 and $5,500.00 for Tax year 2017 and put everthing into VTSAX. You can do this if you do it before April 15th and have not filed your taxes.
Open a brokerage account at Vanguard. Put half into the Vanguard Total Stock Index Admiral Shares and the other Half into Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Admiral Shares.
Nobody is going to tax an inheritance that small. After funeral expenses, state probate cost and legal fees it will be even less. Basically you will get a beneficiary IRA. The only thing to worry about with that is you will have to adhere to a withdrawal schedule based upon your mother's age. So at the point where your mom would have turned 70 and 1/2 you would have to begin withdrawing the money.
This is the correct answer.
You could put it in EE U.S. Saving Bonds or a MyRA account from the U.S. Treasury which you can eventually roll into a RothIRA when you have more money.
You need a bank to do this. When my father passed I needed a medallion signature to transfer some of the assets to my mother. \n\n\nCheck with your local bank, there may be a dollar amount limit but, I think it usually runs up to 100K so if you are transferring less than that it should not be a problem.
Maybe two twenties and a ten each week. A lot of places won't take anything bigger than a 20.
It is complex in that there does not seem to be much of a rhyme or reason to the picks. It is like OP's cousin just opened up the funds page of the Wall Street Journal and threw darts.
Are you putting in dashes or leaving out dashes when you type in the number? Look closely at the web site to see what format they want.\n\nThe other possibility is you don't know your real social security number. Do you have the actual card or is this the number your parents gave you with no documentation? Social Security numbers have a very specific format that indicates the the state in which the card was issued and the approximate time frame those numbers were issued. You may be off by a digit.
Roll it over to a Traditional IRA at Vanguard. You can do it yourself on their website. They will walk you through the process and move the money for you because you do not want to touch it.
It is funny. When I was a child all old people had rough creaky voices. It seems strange to see a "young voice" coming out of older women in their 70s.
If Perez wins I am officially done with the Democratic Party.
Fill you Firefly hole with "The Expanse".
While I generally agree with this sentiment it can be hard to do this when it involves family. OP probably should sit down with his mother, tell her she is caught and demand full restitution. If his mother balks go to the police. \n\n\nIt may require that the mother turns over her paycheck to the son and have the son put her on a budget, pays her bills and gives her a weekly stipend for miscellaneous expenses.
Are you entering 9 digits?
Star Trek really did not become popular until after it was cancelled and went into syndication in the early 1970s. It had a hardcore dedicated fan base, thus the letter writing campaign but, never had big ratings.
If you inherited them you may not have much of a basis so the taxes would not be too bad. How long ago did you inherit them?\n\nIf you are moving to “substantially identical” funds The "Wash Sale Rule" may apply but, you should probably run that past a CPA.
Call your state's department of consumer protection.
When I was married I had similar situation. We made good money for the late 1990s. We weren't extravagant, couldn't save a dime. My wife was a CPA so I let her run all the finances/ bill paying.\n\nAfter the divorce my income was cut in half. I started saving like never before. I couldn't believe how much I was putting away. I'm convinced she was taking money and giving it to her deadbeat brothers and parents. \n\nGet a program like Quicken and handle all the finances yourself. Make sure you know where every dime is going.
If you have 15K and only $900.00 debt just pay the $900 off and be done with it unless there is more debt you haven't told us about.\n\nThen put your 15K into a CD Ladder of 1yr, 2yr and 3yr CDs with 5K in each.
Did you get to episode 4? That's where it starts to pick-up.
Depends on  if sheltering $5.5K in taxes is more important than maxing out the tax free growth of the Roth. Ideally you should try to maximize both.\n\n
Interest is probably accruing and compounding on those loans. What was the professor's degree in, Stupidology?
You may want to look for other options in your 401(k) with lower expenses.
Without knowing the ticker symbols of the funds my guess is you are getting gouged on fees, commissions and taxes. You should have been making 13.5% or more over the last three years given the way the market has been performing. JP Morgan is probably not the place to be. Consider moving to Vanguard and investing in a low cost index fund like Total Stock (VTSAX) or SP 500. \n\n\nThere is no way you should be losing money over the last three years.
Nothing "Game of Thrones" is fantastic. \n\n\nIt isn't called "Game of the Small Folk" after all.
If you are interested in additional books to read:\n\nCommon Sense on Mutual Funds by John Bogle\n\nThe Millionaire Next Door By Robert J. Stanley\n\nThe Millionaire Mind by Robert J. Stanley\n\nA Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel.\n\n\nWhen buying mutual funds you need to be concerned about 3 attributes in your tax advantaged accounts and 1 additional attribute in a taxable account:\n\n- Expense Ratio\n\n- Sales Loads (Commissions for the salesperson)\n\n- 12b1 Fees (These are Marketing/Advertising Fees)\n\n- Turnover (For taxable accounts only.)\n\nYou should be shooting for the lowest expense ratios possible at least below .20% or even .10% in some of the high dollar amount funds like VTSAX (.05). You best bet is to put your money in index funds that track the SP500 or Wilshire 5000 (the entire stock market).\n\nIf your fund has sales loads or 12b1 fees run away as fast as you can. You are getting ripped off.\n\nTurnover really only applies in taxable accounts. Turnover occurs when your active fund manager is trying to beat the market by continuously buy and selling and trading. This generates short term capital gains which are taxed at regular income rates rather than the much lower long term capital gains and dividend rates that are capped at 15%. The lower your funds turnover percentage the better.\n\nIf you would like to look-up your fund's attributes, Yahoo Finance, Market Watch and Bloomberg all have pretty good screeners.
At this point it is too late. They are set in their ways. Best to work on your own finances and stop worrying about theirs.
Don't forget Search for Spock
Depends on the funds, the expenses and the fees. You would probably be better with a total Stock Index if your work 401K plan offers that. Without knowing the Ticker symbols of your funds and what other choices are available in your plan it is hard to really give good advice.
If the Handmaid's Tale is a big hit it would help.
Every single one of these funds is under-performing the market significantly.
I thought you needed a Masters to be a Physician Assistant. You may have to get a bachelors 1st. Which would mean six years of school.\n\nYou might want to think about a 2 Year Associates Degree Registered Nurse program. You can always go back for you bachelors later and ultimately your masters and become a Registered Nurse Practitioner. They make pretty good money. 
Might as well be. Sure you'll get some lip service on gays and a little bit of environmental protection but, the DLC third way types abandoned the poor and working classes the day Bill Clinton was elected.

Ugh, while it is certainly correct that Trump should make a clear statement against antisemitism, this is clearly a sign that Killary is thinking 2020. She's the reason Trump is President.

Take the job. You can always enroll part time to work on your bachelors. By a cheap reasonable car not something flashy and get a one bedroom apartment in a good area. Save Everything you can so if this falls through you will have something to fall back on.
Someone else told me Corporate Democrats are really just pro-abortion Republicans.
Sell off a little bit of the company stock at the end of every year when you have a good estimate of how much you are going to make.

If I defend Putin am I automatically a Russian agent? Would I also receive an agent's pay and benefits? Because I'd totally do it.
So let me get this straight. It's a bigger deal to you that the "Russians" were able to expose those emails rather than the contents of the emails being a big deal? Seriously??
Were not in /r/politics
If they both suck why is one considered fake?
So stupid that you are trying to compare them. Obviously you can't talk negatively about Trump on the Donald but that doesn't mean /r/politics should be so one sided.
I can't understand why people act like the Donald censoring anti Trump stuff is as crazy as /r/politics censoring pro Trump stuff...

What is the point of the wish list if not this?
...unsubbed
Even if he was in support he didn't vote yes on it like another potential candidate...
You do know what he's talking about
Easy, because for months leading up to the election if you turned on the news you would see that "Trump is bad because X and Trump is bad because Y" the average person sees this and says "hmm Trump is bad" other people however wonder why the coverage is so one sided, and how Hilary had scandals that many considered to be worse than saying "grab her by the pussy" and yet those were never coveted only mentioned.\n\nNow to answer that question, since the average stupid voter could tell that Clinton was obviously going to win (because have you seen the TV? Who would vote for Trump) they had no encouragement to go vote. Where as Republicans knew that they HAD to go try to stop her (because have you seen the TV? That crook is going to win) so when they finally went and voted they vote same party down the list.\n\nTLDR: Media thought they could pick someone and that's it, quite the opposite occured

Too complex, I'll check back on this comment once I'm older maybe then I'll understand.
It's almost like theres a reason you have a wish list
Jesus, I guess I'll do the explaining.\n\nFirst off I'll start by saying I don't do either of the things that were talking about but I understand them.\n\nWith that said real win trading (that occurs at the highest level of play) occurs so that a clan can feel like hot shit and be the best clan. They do this by COMMUNICATING to the clan members and telling them to intentionally lose when facing another clan member. Or in some cases since it's frowned upon now they end in a tie (lol) rather than.. you know.. just playing the game.\n\nDropping trophies on the other hand is a completely different type of thing. Perhaps some people are either A. Not good enough to attain quick trophies at their trophy level. Or B. Looking for an easy way to complete their clan chest.\n\nYour right! They both have goals and means of doing it but they are nowhere near the same thing.
Why are you subbed?

Everything in this sub is clickbait bullshit
Wait a second, they did!
There is no communication involved between people that are intentionally dropping and people beating them. Nova win trading on the other hand has a whole system of rules and shit to make them look like the best clan. Completely different things

you should consider doing a factory reset as soon as you get the phone and after any major software updates.\n\nThings get left behind and mucked up after updates.

alright, so that I'd be more inclined to use their policy.  These guys aren't boots...could they be resoled?  Maybe?  I'm not sure.  I'll probably be buying that second pair of shoes eventually and then maybe I'll contact customer support with the idea they'll repair the wear and tear for a cost, but if they can't, I won't pursue it any further.
I'm having trouble defending his actions from the point that everyone thinks he's an anti-semite.  I know he's not.  he's an idiot if anything who succeeded in choosing the worst possible thing to say.  he has to deal with the outrage and the anger and the loss of viewers and the bad publicity.\n\nOf course the string of previous off color humor creates a pattern that people love to harp on.  I know as someone who was in a similar situation.  That multiple bad jokes does not make you racist/anti-semetic/hateful.  It means you don't think about what you're saying.  I put my foot in my mouth very often.  It's gotten better, but I've had friends and family who loved me enough to not hate me for my stupid mouth and cared enough to help me fix my shit.\n\nThis will be a learning experience for Felix, and good luck to him, I just hope he can still be successful.

I found Bacon Reader when I had a windows phone and I fell in love.  I moved to an IOS and then an android and I pined for my dearest BaconReader...and then it popped up one day "Available on..." and I cried tears of joy.  So glad to have it back.
probably is as simple as Asics Swimsuit on google search
If you have an Nvidia video card in your laptop/desktop and it supports game streaming via the Nvidia software "gaming experience", you can use the app(also available on IOS) to connect your phone to your computer and stream your game to your phone/tablet/device and play the game as if your device was another monitor.
Use your phone?  It can work in a pinch when you don't have your glasses
when I was about 10~11 years old.  I was that kid.\n\nI was at a cross walk near my elementary school.  Never had a problem there.  Shouldn't have been an issue.  I was on the sidewalk waiting, the crossing lady was right next to me, my mom was sitting in her car across the street waiting for me to cross.\n\nThe crossing lady goes to step out and then immediately stops and doesn't proceed because there was a mini-van coming.  Probably going about 30, not very fast, but fast enough and close enough that the crossing lady shouldn't probably go out there.\n\nI, however, did not see her stop and change her mind.  I took 3 steps and put myself directly in front of this mini-van.\n\nI was not hit.  I can still see myself jumping in the air and my hand pushing against the hood of the mini-van. The car stopped, I landed on my feet and then shot like a bullet across the street into my mother's car.\n\nMy mother was surprisingly calm about the whole situation.  She checked to make sure I was ok.  She got out and talked to the poor, crying woman in the mini-van and the crossing guard who was just as shaken.  I remember the adrenaline and then crying for a short while because I dodged getting run over.\n\nInteresting post-script to the story, I don't recall if it was before or after, but another kid did get hit at that cross walk because of the same situation.
not aware of that, sorry.
I believe he does as this is getting him right in the feels, he just used heart.

good luck!
And where the heck am I going to put them all?!
Remor...Remorse, how did I not see that?
Have you done the system update recently?  Did you a do factory reset after?  Always do a factory reset after an update.  It should resolve the issues you're experiencing.
If there's anything to learn from this GET PET INSURANCE.\n\nI know you have it and that's great to hear.  I had my own scare a few years back and I would have been in deep deep trouble had I not had it.\n\nIt was completely covered short of medication.  That was a great relief.

Yea, I don't really see this as a submission thing.  They were observing a minor custom.  It's a piece of cloth over their head, it's not like they're asking for permission to drive.
I'm a 33 year old man. Sleep apnea on a bi-pap.\n\nI get ok-ish sleep, 7+ hours, and I'm in the same boat.  No energy when I get home from work.\n\nI'd suggest getting a sleep study.  It's possible your quality of sleep is questionable.  Do you wake up in the middle of the night?  Anyone say you snore?
Fine, you don't have to, wiping it first does you no benefit because the update will make it's changes and you do it again to clean up the problems it could create.
Bless this man with an amazing victory
OH! sorry man, i thought my explanation wasn't clear enough.  Glad I could help.
I can understand that.  Thanks!
does the return include normal wear and tear.  i've had a pair of shoes for about a year I bought from them directly.  I don't want to cause issues if I'm not going to get a replacement, but they are wearing a little and I may need new ones.  I do plan on purchasing another pair as well because they've got the lasting power I haven't had in a while.
I'd suggest TypeApp\n\nas it has customizable notification actions and customizable android wear actions.  Which I need and no other email platform has.\n\nI need my mark as read, archive, and delete actions.  it would be nice to have the ability to customize it further, but i will take what I can get ever since CloudMagic went retarded.
yes, it does canned replies I believe and from the notification
fair enough
go premium if you care enough, but if not, there are a bunch of other apps out there that may scratch your reddit itch

I can recommend Brother as a reliable printer.  I've had one sitting in my living room idle for months at a time.  I hit print and shockingly it fucking prints.  No complaints of clogs or other crap.  It just freaking prints.\n\nI can say get a laser printer, not an ink jet.
I have this with Auto-Voice and use "Scooby Do where are you?" and it will start playing the scooby do theme song.  Works great.
That's the kind of information I'm looking for.\n\nThank you.  Right now I'm leaning toward Amazon.

But you're not the only one to suggest it as a great mail client so I wouldn't want to turn anyone away that would find it extremely good.
Evolve does allow you to mute a conversation, but not entirely.  it still shows up as a notification for me, i haven't been able to get that to go away.  I'm not trying yatta sms and it appears to be able to mute a conversation.

* **Tentacle Wars** - great mobile game with random generated levels\n\n* **Tasker** - Automate nearly EVERYTHING on your phone. Want your phone to turn wifi off when you're not home, and on when you are home, done.  At night when I go to bed, when the stars align just right(Phone is wirelessly charging, watch is charging, i'm connected to my wifi, and it's between 11pm and 7am) my phone goes into Do not disturb, everything dims and my screen timeout goes to 10 seconds, all that reverts when I wake up.  /r/tasker for more ideas and help.\n\n* **Evolve SMS** - almost the best SMS replacement I've used, just \nneed the ability to completely mute notifications for a conversation\n\n* **BaconReader** - Best Reddit app I've used\n\n* **MoonLight** - if you have an Nvidia GPU, you can stream to your phone any game you have installed and play with a connected controller, kinda like the Nvidia Shield.\n\n* **BS Player** - Plays any video file thrown at it and can connect to your computer's network shares(including the dollar shares) and stream files without downloading first\n\n* **Perfect viewer** - read any zipped up image archive as a paged book, also connects to any computer via folder share(including dollar shares) and streams the file without downloading first.

I had a situation like this once.  I was walking to my car and there was a goat.  Just roaming the street.  it had a chain collar so it was definitely owned by someone.  I stood there in the middle of the street effectively dumb struck.  A guy just walks down the street, "Oh, i know who owns this" takes the chain and then walks off.\n\nI live in Brooklyn, NY.  WTF.
you might be waiting forever especially if this is a problem specific to your phone and not a widespread issue.\n\nI'd suggest looking into learning how to backup your data effectively so you don't lose anything even if you weren't to do a factory reset.
Always factory reset AFTER an update.
crap, my printer is too small!\n\nSo jealous
You are absolutely correct.  Tasker has a bit of a learning curve.
I wouldn't be too worried about it.  They'd probably give up pretty early on, they wouldn't have the heart.

Huh- hadn't imagined them working this way - like an aircraft carrier with the drones flying little short distance fights.\n\nI'd always thought of them all leaving from a central office.  This way  is more efficient, in terms of drone usage.  The UPS truck could be stuck in traffic, and still make a lot of close by deliveries.
Correct
What's the weight of the new system vs the old.  Looks like the center muffler should save some.
Our just the simple act of the patient waking down the hallway, touching a railing, elevator button, etc.    Other than direct patient contract, getting rid of the coat will not change anything I suspect.

No - that's not how it was, or how it is.\n\nYes there are long hours - mainly because there's a lot of work, and people don't tend to get sick only from 9-5.\n\nPeople go home when the work is done - because you are responsible for that patients well being and life.  No one is just hanging around waiting for someone else to finish - it tends to be very egalitarian - everyone chips in to get the work done, so we all get to leave w/o crapping on one person.
Lord of the rings, as the Hobbit were never very popular, at least not in the magnitude of Harry Potter.

People make the mistake of abandoning lanes.  There's no reason to not use all lanes - doesn't make sense to abandon the lane 5 miles ahead of time - that makes for increased traffic.
Absolutely
I pretty much only have my family and self seek care at academic hospitals. I've even had procedures done at my own hospital- just picked an anesthesiologist that I don't work with routinely.\n\nAll the best hospitals in the world are teaching hospitals.    Why wouldn't some one seek the best care?

Meanwhile,  Mr Sanders has been non-stop after Trump.\n\nListen almost anyone would be a better president than Trump, but the DNC like did some shady stuff, to back HRC, who is disliked by many, many people.  She lost to a misogynistic carnival barker, who no experience.\n\nI voted for her, only for the fact that she would get to choose a Supreme Court justice.  I think she's a big business DINO, and there are many other democrats far better than her, Warren, Gabbard who would make a better Democratic president.

If 50% of the population institutes a total boycott of the trump brand, and associated businesses, he may quit.  That will be the deal- you leave the office, and we'll stop the boycott.
Ya, I thought about that as well.  Maybe leave a note, just to make sure they knew what they did..  but that's just too much trouble, unless they really pissed you off - at that point you just dump your smoothie, or whatever riser you have around on them.   I've never been that annoyed though.

Yes, but consumer spending of a thousand dollars to save 20 pounds isn't worth it.  \n\nEven if you track your car, unless you notice a lap time difference between a full tank of gas and a half a tank, then you're​ not good enough to benefit from the weight savings.\n\nInitial best weight savings are likely getting smaller, lighter rims, to reduce unsprung weight.

Second this- OP needs to decide with his fiance as to how informal they want their wedding you be - she may have a very different idea than yours.\n\nJust a general observation - the more trendy/ in style something is, like the lighter grey 3 piece suit/ groomsmen with vests, the more dated/ out of style it will look in a few years.    That second photo you linked from the MFA will look like a  leisure suit and a 70's 'fro  wedding in a few years.\n\nHaving your groomsmen buy any old grey suit is going to look very sloppy/ haphazard - they won't match in color, fit, style.\n\nhttp://sh-www-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/originals/566.jpg

I absolutely agree.  Handwashing likely will reduce the highest rate of direct transmission among medical staff.  The rest,(getting rid of ties, white coats) is likely to reduce a percent or two.  Would we be better off re-educating the nurses asst, taking the BP machine from room to room?\n\nMy favorite example is seeing the family of patients on contact precaution - they'll hug the patient, and then put on the gown.\n\nWe'll likely never get rid of the pt who comes in with unknown MRSA, is seen by everyone, and then found out a day later, and then put on contact precautions.  This is the more likely source .

Yes, wound cultures are inaccurate, not reflective and often misleading.  They should not be done. Cultures should be obtained either intra- op OFF ABX for at least 2 weeks, or via IR.\n\nThe vast majority of orthopaedic related infections do not need ABX, unless they are toxic, or involve a native joint.  Prosthetic infections can be handled on an outpatient basis.\n\nAt least twice a month, I'm discussing this with some random community ID, or PCP doc.
Maybe a long time ago - but most bikes take longer to stop than most cars.\nhttp://www.beginnerbikers.org/showthread.php?18441-stopping-distances\nHigh performance bikes stop around 115-120 ft which is the average stopping distance for a car like a Camry.\n\nMany sports type cars can easily out stop a bike.

I thought you were talking about the sword in the pic, my bad.\n\nThat hook in the pictured weapon is supposed to point down when wielded, to pull on shields. I don't know how it's represented in game though. It's the same reason a lot of Viking axes have a hook.

This was posted, literally at the same comment depth, 11 minutes prior to your comment:\n\n>Yeah "put all Mexicans in camps" is really a legit interpretation of this:\n\n>>&gt;Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as "catch and release," whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.\n\n>>&gt;Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.\n\n>Because putting illegal aliens in jail and then deporting them is "putting all Mexicans in camps".\n\n\nAnd if that doesn't do it for you, here's section 5.\n\n>Sec. 5.  Detention Facilities.  (a)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.

Because we don't have existing detention facilities in the US?
It sounds weird, but I can totally see "The Last of Us" soundtrack fitting really well.
Say what? You think people just gave up the PlayStation?
Because you give it to them... But yes, it's true.\n\nHere's the NYC version: Police may stop and briefly detain you only if there is reasonable suspicion that you committed, are committing or are about to commit a crime. You should ask if you are under arrest or free to leave. In New York, you are not required to carry ID, and you don't have to show ID to a police officer.
I want to know the thoughts inbetween those ideas...
We have detainment centers already. Prove a need.

Yeah, no. \n\nAt some point, you have to mark your line. Mine is a pedant. The words mean the same thing, you understand them as the same thing, and both are recognized terms. There is literally no leg to stand on.
Depends on the class. For instance, if this is an english credit of any sort, you dispute the hell out of it, and specifically ask for a guideline on why that's incorrect.\n\nYou don't just get to mark shit wrong because you don't agree. That's the mark of a VERY shitty teacher.
That makes absolutely no sense, in context. You didn't mean to be insulting, so you used an obscure insult from a book? What did you think it meant, for curiosity's sake?
Yeah, I'm not sure we give a damn about the opinions of a Nazi.
Why not both? I like to eat my cake.

I would not trust that coffee.
So, honest question - what's holding back the other 6?\n\nIt's clear this guy is completely insane.\n\nOk so maybe 4 are Trump disciples but surely we can pick up another 2 for every 10, right?
In this case, in my opinion, you're looking at it wrong. From an accounting standpoint, sure, you have a point, but here, no.\n\nEven if you take half of the "MSRP" value off in the first year, the vehicle was never intended for resale, like a consumer vehicle. With that in mind, you have to look at utility as value. There's probably five to ten years on a new truck, and they just lost 4 to 9 of them, if were taking for granted that its about a year old.\n\nNow, they have to pay another 600,000, years before they budgeted for it. This can equate to less staff, equipment, sexy calendar photo shoots, or whatever firehouses need.
I just quoted another comment, and added a different section of the order. I never used hyperbole myself, in fact, you can go into my recent comment history and find me stating that I'm not of the opinion that it is in the works. \n\nI am however, of the opinion that this would make internment feasible, and that's enough for me to not support it.\n\nGood talk.
That's what whiny bitches do. If you listen, they'll keep whining.
>They created this gritty medieval setting and then put in stupid effects like this that don't fit.\n\nBecause, really, in a game about Vikings, Medieval Knights, and Samurai all being in the same place at the same time, realism and cohesion are the key.
You're inferring subtext in my comment, where there was none. \n\nThese are strategically placed detention centers, intended to house one specific racial demographic.\n\nRegardless of thier current legal status, this is one step away from internment camps. While I'm not stating that internment is going to happen, this makes the possibility of it that much greater, given that these facilities would be in place. 
From what I understand, my dad used Ancestry.com pretty extensively, but it helps that England has one of the longest uninterrupted records of births, marriages, etc...\n\nIt also helps that we come from nobility, they tend to have more written about them....

I can see the logic in your argument, but I don't think we can look at it the same as a company. For me, the distinction between public money and private money makes all the difference. Plus, depreciation isn't really a factor, because these vehicles don't get resold usually. If they do, yes, it's for a loss, but its also being sold to a smaller department.\n\nEither way, I dont think you're wrong enough to justify all the shade you're getting.
As long as we're talking about related topics, good aesthetics are subjective, historical accuracy is not.\n\nAnd what exactly would you classify powerups as, if not magic? Cause there's not shit on earth that magically heals wounds in a second flat.\n\n

Ah, gotcha. My vaporizer is much different, and used only domestically.
You must be the reason they disapprove of gay rights.
You may not think you were being insulting, but calling someone naive because they're simply stating the way something should work is kind of insulting.\n\nDude was stating a point of fact, that's how it should work.
You're talking about sex, this conversation is about gender. \n\nEither way though, nothing that would benefit this person would have any effect on you, so if you don't like the topic of transgender rights, just leave it be.
I'd think a lower clearance would be better. If they don't have clearance to view it, they can't spill it on accident.

You're forgetting that phones of a non-cellular variety exist.
>Sec. 5.  Detention Facilities.  (a)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\n\nI know, there was a lot to get through. I made it easy. You're welcome.

Personal experience from my own app.  You can't tell who it is.\n\nI put a toolkit in my app called Anticrack in about 100 places, and it slowed but did not stop the piracy.\n\nI later removed it due to a legit customer having a problem, and then lost ALL my sales.\n\nConclusion: Jailbreakers suck and the App Store is a terrible place to do business.

Pain of loss mixed with pain of guilt.\n\nPlease know that you did the right thing.  A dangerous dog cannot ethically be re-homed.  If you dropped him at a shelter, he could have killed someone's child.\n\nEuthanasia is a painless and peaceful way to go.  It is exceedingly humane.  This is likely a better result for Duke than him living in his own mental torture.\n\nAgain I'm so sorry.

Hi ForgedAnvil.  Thanks for doing this.  I've been looking for a 5e generator!  \n\nI'm thinking of using this to help my players port their 3.5 characters saved in HeroForge Anew into 5e characters.  I noticed that the spell list is right in the middle of the list of character sheets.  If I print a non spell caster, I have to be sure not to select this sheet.  Is there any way the sheets could be reordered, perhaps IV->III, V->IV, III->Spells Sheet?  This way, when I print the sheets double sided, I, II, III, and IV are all on two pages, and the Spells are on one page for spell casters.

I'm with Rob. I want a spinoff called Age of Serif.  :) \n\nIt was nice watching this start from the very beginning.  It's not often you get to witness this with something that has been planned, you got to see the planning, and now you get to see the execution.  I've also been a fan of Jeff (we share a name) and Patrick (we share a time zone) since watching the auditions.  \n\nThis is why I donate to Neal. Because he is awesome. 
All-Star Breakfast is what you mean. 
I've done the same in my current campaign of newbies.  4d6D1 in any order than an additional d8 point buy.  It made somewhat strong characters they a bunch of goblins wouldn't just mow down during the first session.  I was explicit in telling them the next game would be more 'traditional' and I'm almost thinking 3d6 down the line, figure out character from that. \n
Okay good, I'm not alone.  Now I want Cheddar Bay Biscuits.

Yeah so I have plenty of RSUs and non-qualified ESPP shares even if I sell the ones I've put a sell order on.  And as long as I stay, I'll continue gaining more shares.  The difference is simply whether the stock continues to go up at the rate it did in the previous years (so far this FY, it hasn't) so the 'buy' price vs immediate sell price won't give me that much of a gain.  Part of it is free money (RSU) and part is 15% discount (ESPP).  ESPP has a penalty withdrawing early, so I'd only pull out the qualified shares.  
You're using sharepoint to host RPMs? :( 
>binary search\n\nWat.
The platforms (merrill lynch and computershare) don't allow for that.  I can either sell with a price in mind, or sell at the current price. 
Oh the filter definitely helps.  I was just thinking from a usability standpoint, there are some classes who don't need spells at all, so having it as the last tab seemed to make a little more sense *to me.*  Right-O on the rename, hence bringing it up to you as you'd be the one in control of all the names.  \n\nIt was just a thought!

Binary Search is O(n) under worst-case.  Chances are some deductions could be made.  Four days is a long time to keep cake around.  Four hours seems more likely.  You could simply ask which Susan would working during the time someone saw the cake.  Meanwhile the LP guy is looking at tape and what I assume is maybe 4x playback speed, and you've always determined the Susan responsible.  If she was framed, then you can perform the search.  
You can't just leave out "and intimidation" to make your point slightly more valid.

Hi Neighbor!
You're mistaking having logging turned on with having DEBUG turned on.  Unless I can help it, I would never turn DEBUG on in Production.  Most apps that I support typically have a few Exceptions an hour logged, mostly SocketExceptions or ParseExceptions because of network or data issues at the time.

Thanks!  The IRA is also in Betterment. 
You've got alot of fans.
You mean Vinings?
+1 for Betterment.  I've been getting pretty good returns with 90% Stock / 10% Bond, but YMMV.  I have both an IRA and a "Just Save and Invest" goal set up and transfer $100 a week into both, plus $100 a month into another goal because I'm able to right now.  \n\nDepending on your bank (ideally credit union) you may want to set up a checking and savings account and link them together.  Combined, try to keep about 6 months worth of living expenses fluid.  The rest can be transferred to Betterment (and easily transferred back in the case of a non-IRA account) where you'll earn better interest if you're able to gamble a little with the money.  IRA has a maximum of I think $5500 a year you can invest.  Other types of accounts don't have the maximum.  There are other routes you can go too, in order to diversify.  If you think the money is just way too much for you to self-manage, find a fiduciary (very important, do some googles so you understand completely this concept) wealth management company to give your money to.  \n\nSounds like you have some student loans as well to pay off.  If the percentage is fairly high, you'll want to pay those off quickly.  Remember the golden rule is to pay off credit with the highest percentage first.  Usually credit cards > student loans > car loans > mortgage.  \n\nDon't worry about the IRS stuff.  If you need to, hire an accountant that isn't shady.  It really only takes one or two meetings with them to figure out what you need to do.  \n\nMost of all, have fun.  It's good you're thinking long term though, rather than sinking the money into a nice car or something.
Log4j2 seems to love talking about how well it performs.  Good for it.  If I'm having to log so much in my application that logging performance becomes a problem, I've probably written bad software to begin with and have turned on logging to figure out why something else that's broken.  \n\nedit: grammar.

I work for Home Depot, so I'm going to be referencing this thread along with a comment on the product page (yours maybe?) in an email to the lighting merchant. \n\nThanks for doing the initial troubleshooting.  I hope you didn't lose much hair!

Make sure to ask for an offer letter in writing.  And wait for a few weeks at least, as Lowes is probably trying to quickly ramp up warm bodies for opening weeks.  When there is more competition and the same number of people, the pay will become more competitive.  It does not hurt to ask, so long as you phrase the conversation around your growth and wellbeing.  Gauge how stable your job is compared to those at Lowes, who get paid well for a few weeks and then let go because they are then overpaid, or who get their hours tanked because the store can meet the person/payroll ratio without them.\n\nedit: typo.

She won't give herself and Billy Boy a tax increase.  It says it right on the page. \n\n>Hint: Cutting taxes for billionaires isn’t part of the plan.\n\nThe points laid out by Kat Kane in May 2016 which is when this article seems to be published are just talking points that have polled well with older more conservative democrats.  Actual progressives see these points as already-pandered-to-big-business talking points that she uses in hopes to grab the attention of some centrist republicans.  \n\nAlso, the fact the article blatantly says that billionaires aren't part of the plan is simply cringeworthy. \n\nI am ready for my downvotes now.  I won't fall in line.
Thanks! I guess in previous years the stock was doing so well that it didn't make sense, now that growth has slowed down and I feel like its a good time to get out.

Under Nardelli the stock tanked.

It's done well.  \n\nI do want to note that a) I am not in a position where I know the financial strength of the company before the earnings call, which is good for me, no insider trading, etc. and b) I'll always be gaining HD stock shares due to the benefits package.

I regret saying that they were equal evils. I really dislike Hillary but I wish she was our president right now. 
This looks like its going to cater to millenials, which means I'm probably going to hate it. It looks like it's going to try to combine "lol so random" with "sexy" and in the process make science off-putting and uninteresting. I think I'll stick to books, articles, podcasts, and documentaries to learn about science. 
One of the reasons we like her is because she's thick.

I have that sub. It's great for movies but too boomy for music, in my opinion. In your situation, I would get a smaller sub, maybe a 10 in. that can provide tighter bass.

The sales bring down most Criterion Blu-rays to $20. I just looked up Amazon prices and most are around $27. When Amazon has a sale on these, theyre usually around $20. How are you finding new Criterion Blu-rays that are less than $20 on Amazon?     
It's not the Starbucks and McDonald's making them fat. It's the tortas, tacos, gorditas, and tamales. The Mexican diet is loaded in useless carbs.

Some Muslims are terrorists. The majority are not, but some are. You can't just say a Muslim is no longer a Muslim the moment they commit terrorism. If someone in my family committed a horrible crime, I could go around saying they were never related to me, but it doesn't mean I would be right.

You're using the Goo paint, correct? Did you try any other paint before that? \n\nI'm projecting a BenQ 2050 onto a wall painted with Behr Silver Screen and the image looks great. I'd like to upgrade to a screen, but I don't know if the investment will be worth it (I also don't know which screen would be "best bang for your buck"). The room is entirely light controlled so I don't need to worry about making the image brighter. If anything, it might be a little too bright right now.   
You seem extremely threatened by this fact. I'm not giving it any value. I'm just wondering what David Duke's deal is. Chill out. You're being unnecessarily aggressive.

Some lenses are relatively soft at their widest aperture, like the Rokinons, for example. With that in mind, it's a good idea to buy a 1.4 lens so you can use it at 1.8 or 2.0 with its proper sharpness. I imagine this wouldn't be an issue with higher end lenses. 
Wages and earnings are two different things. That whole issue has been entirely misunderstood. Men make more money because they work longer hours in higher paying jobs (this is part of the reason men statistically die sooner than women). The female and male cashiers at any fast food restaurant make the same amount of money if they work the same amount of hours. This applies to any industry. I can guarantee you that. You have been believing a myth. If women want to make more money, they can do two things: go work higher paying jobs (by working on oil rigs or becoming engineers) or fight to make the jobs they tend to gravitate to (like nursing or teaching) higher-paying. 
Friends don't let friends watch high frame rate movies.

Your statement seems silly as well. Youre making an assumption. If only the protesters voted, then election turn out would be way less than 10% every time. 
Not to the same degree but it did happen http://www.dailywire.com/news/12901/travel-ban-unconstitutional-well-democrats-did-it-joseph-curl\n\nHating Trump has become a sport. I don't like him and, as much as I dislike her, wish Hillary was president, but people like to hate on Trump because that is what the rest of the crowd is doing. It's group think. No one is forming their own views and doing their own research. 
I bet she feels good. 
The only way you'll go through the lamp in a year is if watching movies is your job.

Classic country is great. I recommend Marty Robbins, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, and Loretta Lynn.

Women in the US have way more rights than women in less developed countries, but we still have really bad stuff happening to women here. Human trafficking is still a major problem.

You're insane, OP. I love it. I thought I was out of it for building a sex mansion and filling it with one good looking buff dude and eight sexy girls. I've gotten two of them preggers so far.  
You bring up important points. I'd like to add to one of them. At the same time that our society looks down at women for being career-driven, it also looks down at men for wanting to focus on family. The stay-at-home dad is still a social stigma in our society. 
Wonderful! If I post on reddit about a book, there is a 70% chance that it's from Peter Watts.\n\nThe sequel (sidequel?) to Blindsight, *Echopraxia* takes the vibe of the first book and turns the dial to 11. He's got a great blog too.
If nothing existed you wouldn't be here talking about it. The *only* option is existence.
I'd stay at least six months before trying to find a new job. I'd also do my best at that job (even if it isn't what you want to do). If this is your first job you'll want to make sure you can use this as a great reference!\n\nIn the future, if someone asks, "Why only six months?" You can say whatever you like (as long as it matches the reference). For example: The work wasn't challenging enough, I didn't see the kind of professional growth I hoped for, I wanted to work with [what new company does].\n\nIn my experience short stays at workplaces aren't a huge deal if it is only one of them, because you can use the aforementioned excuses.\n\nBut, your mileage may vary - I've never had a job interview (interview! I've been denied and cold-shouldered more times than I can count) that I didn't get.
Some people still really think that the only reason a woman would want a job is to help support the family, otherwise they'd be home with the kids or homemaking. To them a woman in the workplace is a woman who has no other choice. \n\nI couldn't imagine dating a woman who had this mentality. "So, without me (or a kid) you're nothing? Dead in the water? No goals? No desire to make change in the world? No need to test the limits of your motivation and intelligence?"\n\nIt'd be a complete lack of what I consider the best parts about being human!\n\n

Silly question... can people walk around those campuses if they aren't a student? I don't know how anyone would know anyway.
It'll be fine. Just reheat it well.
Cynical? There is already evidence for everything you listed! The only thing new is simply how much of all of it there actually is.\n\n**Edit:** For example...\n\nWhen you see a well sourced article, people say, "Wow, they even included the sources!" When an honest politician enters government people say, "He doesn't accept money from lobbyists, wow! Amazing!" When the wealthy donate money to a great cause people are impressed. When a company CEO makes LESS than 200x the lowest salary people are in awe, "What a great guy!" When a video is posted online of a police officer playing basketball with poor children in the street, "We need more like him!"\n\nYou see, at this point in time to *not* be on your list is the exception. The things you list are expected and common. It doesn't surprise people to see a bad cop - it surprises them to see a good one.\n\nThis is tragic.
"Bank robbery? Hmph... Looks like it's time for *Plan B*."
Y'know, I dislike that too.\n\n...that high-def sound of pouring, fizzing, ice clinking followed by some buffoon gulping like they just swallowed a whole hardboiled egg and then sighing contentedly like they just unbuttoned some pants that were 3 sizes too small.
Everyone who has had a similar problem as this ends up resorting to regex from what I've seen. I'm barely sure what it is, but I had no idea that it could 'detect' what dates look like. That sounds ideal.\n\nIn that case, would it also be able to detect a series of variables that occur in the same pattern? XXXXXX111111\n\nI may have to go that direction too!
Going off track in that way is always a good thing.\n\nIt is important to remember that a company isn't just hiring the best worker, they're hiring someone that works best with the team. Making a connection to one of the hiring managers like this is incredibly beneficial.\n\nIf someone with an exact match of your skills was on the list, you'd have an advantage over them simply because you were also into home-brewing (or whatever). Equally good workers, but one is more fun to talk to.
Speak for yourself!

I think that as long as you don't withdraw completely, becoming your true self is the best way to find people who you can stand.\n\nWhatever your hobbies are when you're in introvert mode there are other introverts who'd love to have a friend or SO with the same hobbies as them. I wouldn't worry too much. 
Arbitrary response of "Thanks, you too." to the arbitrary ask "How are you?"
You're not wrong to ask these questions. \n\nIf it's a Hillary, I'm sure you'd see everyone change their mind or focus on the next 'Sanders' or 'Ron Paul'. New subs will form accordingly based on popularity and astroturfing.\n\nBernie can't take over the party, but he's been promoting what I've heard referred to as, "Bernie democrats" - y'know, the not-your-daddy's-democrat democrats. Young people are excited about politics right now, this can only be a good thing.\n\nRegarding checks: Unfortunately I think you're correct. It'd be a waste to spend it on Hillary shills - if you want to increase popularity of the democratic party you'd need to do it through Sanders fans and hopeful progressives that expect the DNC to change (even after reading the emails) for some reason. Anything to avoid the eventual creation of new parties or *gasp* the end of the two party system.

I can sort of predict how this went...\n\nHe tells some well-to-do but innocently tech illiterate adult in his life, "I saved up 600 for a computer." They ask, "What kind?", expecting to hear one of two things - apple or mac.\n\nHe replies instead, "I'm not sure yet. I'm going to build it. I'm looking at some sweet *16gb 1600mhz DDR4 RAM though... dual channel of course.*"\n\nThat adult, in their innocent ignorance, assumes that since the child said something beyond their immediate understanding that it is not *them* that are uninformed - The child must be a genius. *Building* a computer? That's like... Bill Gates! The news must hear of this.\n\nAnd thus some newschannel that happens to be stocked full of more tech-illiterates decides to run the report on this genius of a child. The facts start coming out... \n\nHe didn't *design* the parts, but he chose them. He didn't *build* the computer, he assembled it. But, but, he continues to use confusing techy words... They've already sent out the photographer and reporter,  they'll take this to the editor anyway.\n\nBut first, "One question young man. Is your computer an apple or a windows?"\n

Gross weight is the total weight of the packaging and the item.\n\nThe net weight is the weight of just whatever, minus the box and packaging.\n\nWe would then presume that each item ( 10 pcs ) has about half a pound of additional packaging around it, including the cardboard box.\n\n
Are you running heavy electronics in there? (PC, Console)? They can heat the crap out of a room, more than you'd realize. If so, hold a hand in front of one of the fans of the device - it's basically a heater. \n\nSometimes all you can do is leave a door open to help circulate. \n\nYou might also want to simply consider a window-mounted AC unit for that room particularly.
Well, what are you trying to do?\n\nMaybe I can help strengthen your google-fu by showing the search terms I use and the results I get from them.
I listen to a ton of music without vocals.\n\nMusic with traditional vocals is almost like mind control. Someone tries to inject their own thoughts, feelings, or stories into your head. With a lot of popular music this almost becomes malicious in its attempted virality.\n\nMusic without vocals just gives you a new background for your thoughts. You can cater the mood to your desires without modifying your actual thoughts.\n\nI've even decided that certain albums or songs should only be listened to during certain moods - this lets me *evoke* that mood, that mindset I was in, at a time that I want it.
One way I'm familiar with is high intensity workouts.\n\n>Exercise is a highly beneficial activity for most women, producing an\nimproved quality of life. However, adverse effects upon reproduction can and\ndo occur. The mechanism for this appears to be via production of a\nmetabolic fuel deficit, forcing the body into a catabolic framework which\noptimizes health by shutting down the reproductive system.

I can't think of any combination more appropriate for this community.\n\n__\n\n\nAlso...\n\n>A Norwegian study headed by Sigridur Lara Gudmundsdottir, a PhD candidate in NTNU’s Human Movement Science Programme, published in the Journal of Human Reproduction, involving nearly 3000 women sought to discover if extreme or low levels of physical activity affected fertility. All women were of good health and of childbearing age. The study followed these women and regularly questioned them about their level of physical activity between 1984 and 1986. The women were then asked about their pregnancies 10 years later, between the years of 1995 and 1997.\n\n>“Among these women, we found two groups who experienced an increased risk of infertility. There were those who trained almost every day and there were those who trained until they were exhausted. Those who did both had the highest risk of infertility…“We believe it is likely that physical activity at a very high or very low level has a negative effect on fertility, while moderate activity is beneficial,” said Dr Gudmundsdottir.

Not that unusual. I don't work in a CS oriented office right now, but I see our managers (the ones who typically interview) complaining sometimes when it is super busy, sometimes trading with other managers.\n\n"I don't have time to go down there, can you go instead?"\n\nHave you also considered that perhaps you weren't the first interviewee of the day? Maybe you're the 5th one in a row and the engineers are tired and ready to get back to work. \n\nOf course, when you meet five strangers (interviewees) and know that four of them won't get hired it is easy to fall into an apathetic mindset to avoid getting attached to any of them specifically. If you go to the dog pound and get attached to every one you see, it can be a bit sad when you know you can only take one. Most people go to the pound and look at the dogs with disinterest until they're sure of the one they might want.\n\nIt's usually a good sign when the interview goes longer than you expected either way. If you were an immediate, "Not this guy." they would have seemed more rushed than disinterested; just trying to check all the boxes and kick you out.\n\nYou may never know the reason why the engineers seemed disinterested - Busy, didn't want to be there, or simply just don't like having to play "hire-er". What is important is that you gave it your best.
I think I've heard that they occasionally refresh it, some people had luck with updating their parks as parks in small towns for instance. But those anecdotes were from a few months ago.

I was explaining why you see so much Bernie here.\n\nFrom the sidebar:\n\n>This is a permanent "for president" community for the left. Instead of creating a new sub every time someone runs, we can stay organized under one heading.\nAt the same time, we're following Bernie's lead in taking over the Democratic Party, with our people and ideas, so that we're organized and positioned for victories on the issues.\n\nThe sub is leftist for new and current left politicians. What do you expect? On reddit no less... Hillary? Those checks aren't coming in anymore.
You're not alone. Plenty of young folks have been spit out chewed up.\n\nFortunately I made it out with "just" some tinnitus. I keep lots of fans and air filters going in whatever room I'm in.\n\nThere are some pretty stealthy hearing aids out there, but I'm not sure if the VA will spend money on those. You may have to look into it yourself.\n\nAnd there is no shame in an injury like that. You can use it to explain your story to civilians or you can make something up that sounds cooler than "8 months of recurring loud noises". You will also find that most people won't even ask you about it unless they know you a bit better.\n\nImagine someone saying, "So, uh... where'd you leg go?" It just doesn't happen very often on the street.

That was very helpful. \n\nI went ahead and tested it through regex101 as well as using a test regex sequence to make sure I understood how to print the result of re.search...\n\n~~Running the match for my date sequence turns up nothing in the code.~~\n\nI gave it one last shot before complaining to you... Fortunately I realized that when I converted my test regex code into the real attempt (the full date), I forgot to put... "Sent: " That explains it! It also proves that regex won't be likely to pull incorrect data. \n\nYou've been a great help! I feel like my python skills just leveled up.

This just in... "Korean Hillary" promises *not* to give state secrets to a shaman. "Korean wikileaks" publishes her emails, noting that she regularly accepts donations from a company simply known as *Totally not Shamans*.\n\n"Korean Trump" claims, 'I have the best kimchi. People call me, they say... Jin, you have the best kimchi. Everyone says it. It's true, they do! They say it.' He promises to build a bigger wall against North Korea and wins by a landslide. He then promotes the CEO of *Totally not Shamans* to chairman of education.
I would like to think that large beings (like titans) would be too large to survive or move with normal physics. Titans would have mass without weight. They'd be large and strong, but their bones wouldn't shatter with each step.\n\nTitanite adds this property to weapons, increasing their mass but not their weight. This is why both blunt and bladed weapons increase in strength. They're able to hit harder (F=MA) without gaining the weight that would cause them to become unwieldy.

Sometimes you can't.\n\nSometimes you can play mindless video games or watch mindless shows. Sometimes you can find someone to talk to. Sometimes all you can do is lay in bed with the lights off and pray for silence.\n\nAnd sometimes you can just go for a walk. \n\nTake the time to look at nature, at buildings, at people going by in their happy, chaotic little lives. Find a little bug crawling along a little leaf. Is it happy? No, it doesn't have emotions. Does it know where it's going? Nope, but it  marches along like clockwork anyway. And yet it exists? Yes.\n\nSometimes you need to be that little bug for a while. Let the clockwork tick while your neurons sort themselves out. You can find your own little leaf and just march around for a bit.\n\nEventually the skies will clear up a bit and you get to become human again with a relieved sigh - no rush though. You can do a lot with just a heartbeat. Tick-tock.

Former 68W here. You'll be fine, especially if wearing over-the-ear headphones. Depending on the type of hearing aid and levels (and frequencies) of amplification you may want to fiddle with the panning of the L-R speakers. This way you can make one louder than the other (and thus sound equal to you).\n\nDepending on your hearing loss type you may even be able to get away with using panning alone to hear things fine with only the headphones.\n\nThere are also hearing aids with wireless connectivity. Slap a bluetooth adapter on your PC and you can cut out the middleman.

I was going to say that the swordspear would probably be more effective if the guard was also weaponized (sharp, hooks, or something) so that it could be used like a halberd or axe.\n\nAfter reading your description I now see that the dullness of the guard was probably intentional, to avoid getting snagged when trying to slash during aerial combat. If the guard got stuck in something you'd lose the spear (or come off with it). This negates the advantage of having a stuck-proof sword style spear.

Playing around with regex now, thanks. It looks like this is what I need. \n\nI just need to figure out how exactly to find the first occurrence of, "Sent: Tuesday, January 24, 2017 5:01 PM".\n\nIt's a bit hard to wrap ones head around the 'regex speak' quickly.\n\nEdit: By quickly I meant in 5 minutes, I guess.\n\nI now see that your example looks for the arrangement of "Sent: Letters, Digits, 4 digits, digits colon digits, digits (seconds?)"

Geany was a great starting point for me. Very easy to use and understand. It also doesn't have the "Hey, this is wrong, guy." function of an IDE so it lets you learn the basics in the best way possible.\n\nI recently switched to PyCharm (like, a few days ago), which I feel would have been too complex for the, "Hi, I'm 12 and what is python" phase I was in a month and some weeks ago.
As someone with misophonia, I'm happy to see some research supporting its existence. It really sucks to feel such intense anger over something like a coworker crunching on carrots or a spouse eating chips. It's completely irrational and unavoidable emotional response. \n\nI thought it was interesting that the misophonic groups reported [lower scores](http://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/2082616025/2072855328/gr1.jpg) for the typically unpleasant sounds (screaming, baby cry) and the neutral sounds as well (rain, white noise) than the control group. Even more interesting, the scores seem equivalently comparible (yet still lower). This leads me to believe that the misophonia group is rating the sounds on a much different internal scale. \n\nI wonder if adjusting for and bringing the unpleasant/neutral sounds to the same levels would show what the trigger sounds would be rated if the control group experienced it.\n\nAnecdotally, I would assume that the reason misophonia group rated the neutral sounds *lower* is because they typically use such background noise to drown out other noises, therefore making neutral sounds comforting. For instance, I prefer to always have a fan running in the background - I've got three in my home office alone.

[Blindsight by Peter Watts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K15EKM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)\n\n>Canadian author Watts (Starfish) explores the nature of consciousness in this stimulating hard SF novel, which combines riveting action with a fascinating alien environment. In the late 21st century, when something alien is discovered beyond the edge of the solar system, the spaceship Theseus sets out to make contact. Led by an enigmatic AI and a genetically engineered vampire, the crew includes a biologist who's more machine than human, a linguist with surgically induced multiple personality disorder, a professional soldier who's a pacifist, and Siri Keeton, a man with only half a brain. Keeton is virtually incapable of empathy, but he has a savant's ability to model and predict the actions of others without understanding them. Once the Theseus arrives at the gigantic and hideously dangerous alien artifact (which has tellingly self-named itself Rorschach), the crew must deal with beings who speak English fluently but who may, paradoxically, not even be sentient, at least as we understand the term. Watts puts a terrifying and original spin on the familiar alien contact story.
For myself the noise of myself eating is annoying, but only when in the presence of other people. This is because I'm very cautious not to make eating noises in front of others, as I would hope they do for me.\n\nBut I don't really have an issue with my own sounds and I understand that this is common among most people with misophonia. It's strange, but yeah... self-originating noises aren't more troublesome than any other noise would be.\n\nWe know this is illogical too. \n\nHopefully your gf knows that this anger she experiences is an "error" rather than her simply just hating the way you eat things. I think the distinction could be important. It's not fair to blame people for doing something they often can't prevent (or even see as a problem).

Following r/yog_kathog, Coffee (and tobacco) is a mild monoamine oxidase inhibitor. MAOIs have shown effectiveness in treatment for ADHD. We know that treatments that are useful for ADHD tend to also help with motivation in focus in neurotypical individuals as well. Coffee and tobacco are both associated with increased motivation, albeit in slightly different ways. \n\n(As an aside, tobacco can be used as a learning aide and nootropic compound since it gives you immediate control over your reward response.)\n\nAlternatively (or also), the combination of simple stimulant effect and a positive correlation with coffee consumption and "doing" helps increase motivation due to the association with motivation and the act of drinking coffee.\n\nThe "coffee ritual" helps in this regard. If this is the case, you would find that coffee is less motivating when you deviate from your normal method of consumption. For instance, if someone else brewed it for you, chugged it cold instead of sipping hot coffee, perhaps changed the flavor dramatically, or even simply changing the type of cup you drank it out of.

That sounds pretty decent.\n\n...but, I'm a bit cynical at this point. I simply have trouble believing that facebook would do anything truly benevolent.
Exactly. I mean it's 1984 in a way George Orwell could never have imagined because we can never anticipate how the future is going to evolve. Going to the moon was an impossible dream in the 1700s. With the technology advancement increasing exponetially, individually targeted news articles designed to mold people into certain beliefs intelligently would have been completely unthinkable in 1949 when that book was written. I really need to read that book..
It's a great book, highly recommended! 
This is a fascinating idea actually. Think about Trump's exceptionally well targeted Facebook ads to suppress certain voters, but instead of showing them a generic Clinton video you show them a fake news story specifically generated to target their interests and fears. Make it on the spot and put it onto one of hundreds of domains (use the name they're most likely to click through on) you've been pumping legitimate news stories into in the form of AI generated summaries for years. \n\nMaybe this is why Facebook wants to control journalism as their next step, an AI driven article generator targeted directly at tiny demographics one  at a time could be incredibly dangerous.
Conflating the two helps push a dishonest narrative that the intelligence services agree with him.

You've claimed things that are problems if you let people stay in the US without becoming citizens. From my understanding green card citizens are in that category, permanent residents but not citizens. So my question is, does the evidence from the population of green card citizens support your claims that they eg. Won't be identifiable, won't know how much tax to pay and won't know which laws apply to them?

That reported apologised on twitter and Sean Spicer replied "accepted" long before his tirade about it.
Agreed, but is it just an immediate term 2017 only type deal? I thought these deals were typically over a few years, and if this one is then that means the government at least think they can make these deals right?
You know Russian offered a bribe? The only place I've seen that claimed is the dossier (which I don't think confirmed acceptance or refusal), do you have more information on the source that convinced you they did offer a bribe and that it wasn't accepted? 
Do you have a source on Turkey having visa free access to Europe? All that's coming up on Google when I search from the UK is pro brexit paper speculation but nothing credible.

Would this include a green card holder initially from Iran who wanted to go on holiday to Canada, or to a conference in Europe? I can't tell whether the ban is on them returning to their home nation (which is one of the banned ones) and then coming back, or just entering the US (as a citizen of a banned nation, albeit a US green card holder).
Where's that email? Both the author and editor should probably quit their jobs in that case because they're not very clever if that email exists.

They're verifiable falsehoods and somebody who can research and prepare their claims before saying them (like Sean Spicer could) is lying if they say something verifiably false. If he didn't know he should verify before saying it, this wasn't some off the cuff remark or a question he hadn't prepared an answer to.
I'm fairly certain being an essential supporter of Putin is a very lucrative position to be in.
That is interesting, I'm glad he was stopped - thanks for sharing! I suppose the elephant in the room that Trump might see if he didn't surround himself with white supremacists is that right wing terrorism has been a major issue since 9/11, compared to both left wing and Muslim extremists.

https://mobile.twitter.com/wmata/status/822482330346487810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nAccording to this @wmata tweet his 193k is about on par with Bush's 197k in 2005. But Obama had a big drop between 2009 and 2013, so 2nd term was worse for him - if Bush had the same then Trump is low for a first term inauguration. Data is a bit lacking to draw any conclusions other than way lower than Obama really though - 2001 data would be useful.
By all public accounts Trump treated Theresa May well when she visited, and a UK petition to block his planned state visit still got over a million signatures with various protests about it too. Those calls are happening based on how he's perceived to treat people in general, not specifically our leadership - I imagine the reactions will be very strong in countries where he attacks leadership directly.
It's pretty scary how much power the US president has in a democracy with so many (on paper at least) checks and balances. It'd cause a recession in the US for no purpose than a feud the president has and a desire to destroy another country, and you're absolutely right that he could do it if he wanted to.

He did tell the CIA that they should've took Iraq's oil and "maybe you'll have another chance."\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/01/23/donald-trump-iraq-oil-isis-starr-lwe-tsr.cnn\n\nCNN link but first bit of the video is a direct recording of Trump.
Thanks, but that didn't show a revenue decline of half a billion dollars - it shows a loss of $515m (on probably an increased revenue but I haven't checked). Your source also shows a complete lack of understanding in S-1, and then goes on to say that Amazon with ad sales $1.3b are winning in media - is he short on Facebook or something?
This reminds me a lot of the "enemies of the people" rhetoric the Murdoch press used to attack the UK supreme Court for ruling that parliament should have a vote on Brexit.
Why can't Trump's lifestyle adjust instead of taxpayer budgets? Also do you include his family who could easily not charge the secret service for their hotels in his associates?
Just like circumstantial maybe-what-if's being used to justify Pizzagate aren't actually proof, nor is that list. There's no evidence, and I don't think any of the proofs proposed are even new - we already know all that stuff.
This happened before too - Kellyanne Conway made up a 'Bowling Green massacre' that was in the US. 
I wonder if this line of thinking has ever been studied? My gut instinct is you'll get the same false confessions as you do under torture, but I don't have any evidence that's the case.

Where did you get the idea that NBC is the parent company of Buzzfeed? They made a $200m investment (at a $1.7b valuation) for a minority share last year, that's vastly different to being the parent company.
> Google changed their definition of Fascism to include the phrase, "right-wing."\n\nYou mean they changed their dictionary source from whichever one didn't use right wing in their definition of fascism (how is this possible? Mussolini was clearly right wing) to the Oxford English Dictionary definition, which they use word for word and you can see here: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fascism
I don't think Trump has actually openly admitted he plans to cut services, though I might be wrong. Obviously that'll happen if he cuts taxes but there could well be people who think he'll just cut taxes and not affect services. For example he still seems to have a line that he can do ACA better and cheaper, is that his line across the board?
They unfortunately definitely don't believe that because they don't seem to want Apple Music to die, and yet if you want it on your computer.. Yea, iTunes.
Do you actually get banned for being pro-Trump in random popular subs? That's pretty stupid. I'm pretty sure I could make a random anti-Trump statement in say, /r/worldnews or /r/politics without being banned, is that not the case for supporters?

They wrote a piece criticising the BBC for overblowing the threat : https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/uk/752782/BBC-breakfast-weather-report-London-snow-twitter/amp?client=safari\n
I just saw your link, that makes it pretty clear then - Dubai isn't banned, but an Iranian in Dubai is. Incredible, but someone upthread posted the quote "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" and I guess people just didn't consider at the time that it'd also mean Muslims in America who leave the country for any reason being unable to get back.
What's actually going on there? He tweets it at @OANN seemingly in response to nothing, they retweet it with no comment. There's no actual news source in the loop.\n\nEdit: Oh wait, @OANN responded with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPfadLWT64\nSo, OANN puts out this video, but nowhere in it do they make that quote. They're just supporting Trump on Twitter but there's no source anywhere. 
Just to make sure - you're not under the impression it's coming when we leave right?
So after tweeting that the Russians said they don't collect compromising information on anyone so the story must be false, he told us a story about how he tells all his staff when they travel to places including Russia that their hotels are full of hidden cameras. Why does he think the Russians fill their hotels with hidden cameras if they're not collecting compromising information?
Have you seen the i? I'd probably say since releasing that they've been pretty down hill - most of what's shared is just clickbait rubbish now. It's a shame.

Question to OP, in your link about how Mexico will pay for the wall it says : \n\nOn day 1 promulgate a "proposed rule" (regulation) amending 31\rCFR 130.121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to include\rmoney transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine "account" to include wire transfers. Also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien\rfirst provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.\n\nHas Trump done this or said what will be done instead? I haven't heard anything about it.
What did CNN report inaccurately during the inauguration? You're using Trump's lies to justify removing press credentials, isn't that dangerous?
I too hope the all powerful 'they' stop that! It's clearly a plausible threat that David Cameron, no longer a politician, will re-legalize fox hunting. 
Andrew Klavan played clips on his show yesterday - I think it was ABC news and an NYT correspondent but I might be getting things mixed up.
His 317k number was trips before 11am on 21st Jan 2013 (Obama's second inauguration). I'm not sure where 420k came from, but the comparable number for Trump was 193k by 11am on Friday so the comparison isn't even legitimate against Obama 2nd inauguration: https://mobile.twitter.com/wmata/status/822482330346487810\n\nAnd of course you're right, it was 513k for Obama first inauguration. \n\nAlso for comparison, 275k on Saturday for the Women's march: https://mobile.twitter.com/wmata/status/822841417475223552\n\n
Secrets, crimes and audiotapes did an amazing multi-part audio drama of this, highly recommended.
I grew up in South Wales and my family are still there, how that area voted for Brexit with the amount of work done there by EU funding I will never understand.
Could the reason it mattered to him be that the Women's march was drawing what looked from the graphics to be Obama-scale crowds? 
Labour can't vote against it as a block, 70% of their constituencies voted to leave.
I didn't see that - their revenue declined $500m? Is that YoY or between 2 subsequent quarters? Surely that takes them from profit to loss too? Can you give details please where you saw that?
I'm glad you guys are willing to try things to improve the sub. That said, what does your third trial even refer to? Can you give an example like a link to something you'd remove? All I think I understand is that if someone makes valid criticism, then others repeat it and make it an echo chamber, you'll cut the thread from the top? 
Is this the vote at the end of the negotiations? That'll be a vote close to 2yrs after Article 50, between what the government have negotiated and exiting with no deal with the EU - it's a rubber stamp. 
I know about population increase over time and that some of the satellite protests were small, but including those solidarity marches all over the world I wonder if that's the biggest one day protest in the world ever. 
Ugh I laughed because I misread subredditdrama as subredditsimulator...
He did say right at the beginning of that plan: \n\nOn day 1 promulgate a "proposed rule" (regulation) amending 31\rCFR 130.121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to include\rmoney transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine "account" to include wire transfers. Also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien\rfirst provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.\n\nThis seemed to be plan A, has he actually done this?
Were any of them ever appointed in senior positions by Democrats?
That's an amazing improvement for Nixon, ignoring everything else about his 2nd term..
This seems more verifiably false - a lot of what he's said has been taking something hotly contested and trying to make his view on it fact (on the other side I'd put Obama's scandal free administration in this bucket too). But this is verifiably false: there's a time lapse of the whole period, there's photos of floor coverings in 2013, there's Metro data etc etc.
This is a strong response, but just to clarify - your last example about a knife attack at Ohio State University did happen under Obama and you weren't satisfied with his response?\n\nOne other thing, can you explain why pictures of Muslim children killed by Americans are "hate content" (assuming the content is legitimate)? I agree they could incite hatred and terrorism but I don't see how they're hate content in themselves.

Of course I do - it's the fact it's not tracked to a buyer and the money doesn't add up that's fascinating. I highly doubt it's with Trump though - probably some complex unexciting reason for the shells. You said though "we know Russia offered a bribe and it wasn't accepted" which seems to suggest some part of the dossier is proven, which I wasn't aware of. That's what I'm curious about - how do you know? The only source I've heard claim a bribe from Russia is the dossier, which as far as I knew was 100% unverified - so what's the source that Russia did offer a bribe and it wasn't accepted?
Do you define "nothing" as a million dollars (ie more than most Americans will ever have at any one point) or am I misinformed that he received a million dollar loan from his father?
On Windows and MacOS Apple Music is part of iTunes - do you only use it on your phone?
Saudi Arabia is also a business interest for the Trump Organisation, so they shouldn't expect to have any issues. 
Valid response, but my quote including Muslims was his words (as I'm sure you're aware, that was a famous rally) - Muslim ban is what he campaigned on. But yes, when I said it'd apply to Muslims who leave the US and come back, it'd also apply to anyone from those countries in the same way. I think they're all majority Muslim countries but your point is valid.
Smart way to get sales, and she obviously made loads of money off them. Seriously though, do Amazon sell a lot of music? This is the only time I've ever seen their album ranking mentioned anywhere (other than /r/the_donald talking about this..)
Okay, but Trump uses hyperbole in exactly the same way and some on the right don't consider him a liar for it. 
Hillary Clinton has said negative things about and attacked Russia. Therefore, she is less of a puppet of Russia than somebody who has not done those things.\n\nConservative media were calling her a hawk and saying she'd cause a war before the election, now you're saying she'd have been soft on Putin?
This is a really interesting response, so thankyou for opening up this discussion. The stats you quote on business failure, is that pre-IPO? I'd be very surprised if 50% of companies fail within 2 years of going public, but if your source shows that I'd certainly reconsider what I'm about to say. \n\nI disagree with you that 98% of the 1%'s wealth is in particularly risky markets. I think that the risk you're referring to is in pre-IPO companies, investment categorised by angel investment and venture capital.  Short of a very small minority of extremely notable (notable because they're so unusual) wealthy people, most of their wealth is not in those areas. \n\nIf most of their money is in public markets then I'd argue they're not really investing in particularly risky ways and exposing themselves to the extremely high startup failure rate that you refer to.
I believe the dossier claimed he was there for the Miss Universe pageant that he held in Russia, nobody's saying he went specifically for those prostitutes. 
Thanks, I didn't think it had gone through. I wonder how much pull David Cameron had on that decision behind the scenes, the Brexit campaigners were dying to get news about Turkey being miles closer to joining than they are.
Haha, wow. Is it normal for a press secretary to be as unprepared as he seemed to give the actual update remarks at the end? He seemed to be working from memory - I guess he'd spent all his preparation time writing his little rant and didn't have time to write down the actual information..
So it's not a falsifiable claim in the context of the 2016 election right? 
I wonder what the causes of that are and how the Republicans can deal with it - because if you're right then they have a perverse motivation to avoid the economy booming in certain areas. In particular I wonder what they're saying behind closed doors about the effect of Trump pumping money into the Conservative areas he calls forgotten. 
Did Barack and Michelle Obama stay in Trump Hotels though? That was supposedly his motivation. I'm not sure what the usual arrangements are for the president when he visits different countries, but maybe before he was president there really weren't many chances to get into a hotel room shortly after the Obamas? Now he has plenty of chances to have prostitutes in places they slept I'm sure..
It's fair to say there has been bad and lazy reporting lately, so Kudos to the Post for this one.
I think that Schulz prefers a big coalition again. But it would be the best thing which could happen for Germany and Europe. \n\nThe most left-wing government is in Portugal, with even hardcore communists supporting it in parliament.

At 1:33:\n\n“In the USA has the leadership of the Democrats prevented the bearer of hope, Bernie Sanders, to come instead with a candidate of the establishment, who in essence represents everything what makes people doubt democracy, to give with such a candidate Donald Trump the way to the White House. This should not only give food for thought to the SPD (social-democrats which broke down the welfare state) but naturally also the CDU (Merkel’s centre-right party) which has now also a Chancellor which doesn’t know the difference between a democracy and an oligarchy.”\n\nSee also with what disinterest the social-democrat leader and Merkel ‘listen’ to her speech.\n
I love the phrase she used to describe the politics of the establishment parties: "Steuerpolitisches wohlfühlprogramm für Konzerne und Superreiche". Which translates to "Feel good tax politics for corporations and the super rich".
I highly doubt we'll see a big coalition again if the SPD gets the numbers, Schulz is actually quite open to red-red-green.\n\nIt would definitely be the most high profile progressive (not left wing) government in the world.

The brewery doesn't matter that much, but the beer style does. Ingredients, brewing processes and the yeast strains are different from beer type to beer type. Generally speaking, top fermented beer (e.g. Ales, Hefeweizen) has more of these other alcohols than bottom fermented beer (e.g. Lager, Pilsener).
Has nothing to do with chance. In fact many people here are hard determinists.
>He's a conservative, sure, but conservative views are valid political views to have. If people don't want that kind of a conservative, they'll vote against him, if they do want him, they'll vote for him. \n\nNo one is contesting that? You seem to contesthowever that being pro-Le Pen is a valid view to have. \n
Do you also like his lack of program? :p\n\n^(Don't get me wrong, I think it's very good if candidates advocate European unity, but without program it remains empty, which is filled with the 'charisma' of the candidate. And all semi-moderate candidates, Macron, Fillon, Hamon, support the EU but the last two also talk about their program.)
At first I sight I saw only those small houses and thought "Wow large in Liechtenstein is *really* small" but then saw the background, which I assume is Triesen.
Personally, I think that the current climate is indicating a crucial moment were either the EU crumbles into dust and the world will be ruled by autocrats for the foreseeable future or the European Project will take decisive steps towards total integration and become a true world power and, because of our shared history, a stronger force for world peace than any other political structure ever before. \n\nThe European Project until now is the most important achievement in european history and we will need someone at the helm who is willing to do what it takes to ensure it will survive the challenges it currently faces. \n\nThe CDU has a strong pro-european tradition and have been at the forefront of economic integration, but the conservative wing, especially the CSU, would be a serious internal obstacle to further integration. The traditional nation state is not suited to face the challenges of the 21. century, but I think not everyone in the union parties gets that. \n\nI'm not saying that I trust the SPD to make the right decisions and in fact, I have severe reservations about the way the SPD works and many of the policy decisions they make, but I trust that Schulz has the right direction in mind and most importantly, it is believable that he will stand for a free and truly democratic EU with a strong parliament, and not the burocratic clusterfuck it is now. \n\nMany journalists have been writing about how Schulz knows nothing about domestic policy and stuff, but IMO ensuring the success of the European Project is *the single most important* policy issue not only for Germany and Europe, but for everyone else on this planet, even. \n\nIch hoffe meine Pfostierung hat Hohe Energie.\n
That is actually not completely accurate. Laboratory photosynthesis can be much more efficient. The efficiency of photosynthesis process in terms of using solar energy itself is not the problem. The problem is  using CO2 at athmospheric (read: very low) levels. Plants are much better at that.

Under pantheism he understands: the idea that the whole world is one basic unity. Or: The world is the manifestation of this unity. \n\nThis unity was often called "God" hence the name pantheism. Later others called this unity "the absolute" etc and pantheist Schopenhauer called this unity "Will". He writes about the concept pantheism:\n\n>Against pantheism I have mainly only this: that it does not mean anything. Naming the world God does not mean explaining it, but instead only enriching language with a superfluous synonym for the word ‘world’. Whether you say ‘the world is God’ or ‘the world is the world’ amounts to the same. Of course if one proceeded from God as though he were the given and the thing to be explained, and therefore said: ‘God is the world’, there is an explanation of sorts, insofar as something unknown is traced back to something better known; still it is merely a semantic explanation. However, if one proceeds from what is actually given, hence from the world, and now says ‘the world is God’, it is plain as day that nothing is said by this or at least the explanation is of something unknown by something less known. (PP, v2, 69)\n\nSo the term God makes the term unnecessarily confusing: \n\nPantheism merely says that the world is one unity. One unity can hardly be found in this world so pantheists, like Schopenhauer, say that the world which we see is the manifestation on the one unity. \n\n(Or: the one unity is real, the world which we see is its representation)\n\nMainländer rejects the co-existence of one unity together with the world. The world is a collection, not a unity. So he rejects pantheism. One unity has once existed, it no longer exists.\n\nImmanent means that you don't go beyond the boundaries of expierence, which Schopenhauer does a lot. (What an unnecessary mention of God of that definition! Mainländer's definition is much clearer, in the first quote in the opening post.) Mainländer is proud that he doesn't: therefore the name *the immanent philosophy*.\n\n>Would you consider the main difference between the two being that of unitariness? \n\nYes indeed. \n\n> It seems that the "Rotting Body of God" concept can be seen as a form Pantheism, or Pandeism, as well as Immanence.\n\nThis is why the term God must be used so carefully, Mainländer is extremely careful when he does that. I think that the writer of that blog played way too much with the terms of God, talking about a rotting body of a suicidal God etc, something he tried to rectify in his second post.\n\nMainländer says there once was a pre-existence, now there is existence which dissolves into non-existence. That is clearer without using old terms which mention god.\n
Like Schopenhauer said, we should refer to each other with \n>my fellow sufferer.
Yes, I doubt it can be found online. He writes this in a letter to a friend he hasn't seen for years but knew from his childhood. The book of letters I have of him is a Dutch translation called "De wereld deugt niet", he writes it on page 110, to Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire on 10 dec 1836.\n\nEdit: I just discovered that the letter can actually be found online! http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/schopenhauer/content/titleinfo/4235398 He writes it on page 5 in French: "2 batards, que j'avais, tout morts jeunes."
Also the highest virtue of Christianity is celibacy:\n\n* Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it. (Matth. 19:11-12)\n\n* And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage: but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. (Luke 20:34-36)\n\n* These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They have been redeemed from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. (Revelation 14:4)\n\n* Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good to abstain from sexual relations. (1  Corinthians 7:1)\n\n* An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world. (1 Corinthians 7:32-33) \n\nWhat is the goal of celibacy? St Augustine openly writes that the Kingdom of God and annihilation of the world are one and the same:\n\n>I know some who grumble and say: If all were to abstain from procreation, how would the human race continue to exist? Would that all wanted to abstain! provided it were done in love, from a pure heart, with a good conscience, and sincere belief, then the kingdom of God would be realized far more quickly, since the end of the world would be hastened.\n\nOf course, since this doesn't help the Realpolitik of the Catholic Church pro-natalism was quickly embraced, keeping celibacy required for priests, nuns, monks. But there have been many anti-natalistic Christian sects throughout history, which therefore always disappear, such as Encratites, Cathars, Shakers.
Since you also asked about the electoral procedure to elect the French President:\n\n1. ***First round***: Anyone can be candidate. Two persons with most votes go round 2.\n2. ***Second round***: Person with most votes wins.\n\nDesigned to keep "extremist" candidates away from power, centre-left and centre-right moderates support the moderate candidate to keep the extremist out of office. Best example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2002\n\nIt's not a given however if the same would happen in a Fillon VS Le Pen scenario. Fillon is so right-wing and socially conservative that the people could vote for the protection of the welfare state ^(meaning ^Le ^Pen) in this case... 
I got interested in your posts because you're a Catholic christian. What surprised me to see is that even you who clearly has absorbed the Christian teachings, you write about not having a girlfriend as regrettable. \n\nBut you know what is written:\n\n> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, *you have not sinned.*\n\nAnd also:\n\n>An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world\n\nIn Revelations: \n\n> These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They have been redeemed from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
Closer to realism than Kant and Schopenhauer, but like S he says that philosophy has to be idealistic just in order to be honest. Matter is the way how we perceive the things-as-they-are.\n\nKant and Schopenhauer claim that their idealism doesn't "attack the *empirical reality* of the world, but only says that that reality is not unconditional", but Mainländer says that these are empty promises of their lips, and that their idealism hits the empirical reality in its core.\n\nIn their transcendental idealism the whole world is the projection of a single point (an X with Kant, a numberless Will with Schopenhauer), the only thing which is real, and this point goes through the prism of space and time in our brain which makes appear to us the (ideal) world.\n\nMainländer agrees that time and space are not properties of the things-as-they-are, that time and space are ideal. But he doesn't agree that they are *pure forms of perception* lying in our heads before any experience. \n\nThe individual wills work with each other, they are always in motion (a Will in rest is unimaginable). The point of motion is real, says M, we perceive it as the present, and connecting this to a line is *time*. Time exists only in our head, like with K and S, but there is movement. \n\n>Do you think he would claim that the world is real only because the Individual Wills are real and not the other way around?\n\nYes, even if there would be no observers the individual wills would exist and work with each other. Through space we see where and how they work in each other.
***Netherlands***\n\nIt's relatively big if I compare it to France (my other nationality). In all supermarkets you have meat substitues, often with a lot of choice. In restaurants I never encounter problems as most of them have vegetarian meals, very much unlike France. \n\nWe also have [The Vegetarian Butcher](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/mock-meat-the-rise-of-the-vegetarian-butcher/) whose goal it is to make 'meat' with meat texture which tastes like meat, because it's the no.1 reason why people love meat. Their products are sold at a lot of places, tastes excellently, but not very cheap. 
In general questions are for /r/askEurope , but to answer it: not much. They would get less total MEPs and less total voting power in the Council however.
I think that it's difficult to give one single reason for all humans. Some greek thinker said that humans live out of fear for death. Unless you are determined to end your life, your goal will always be to make it as bearable as possible. 
In practice the two-round system prevents 'extremist' candidates from winning elections, because the centre-left and centre-right voters rally behind the non-extremist candidate in case an extremist candidate manages to get to the second round.\n\nThe most famous example is the [2002 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2002) with Le Pen.\n\nHere is a list of the major candidates: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/5rd0zt/can_someone_give_me_a_summary_of_the_french/dd6brp3/\n\n
What she said was more egocentrical than egoistic.\n\nQuite special to see a Christian AN, do you think it was the goal of Jesus' call for celibacy? Or like St Augustine says:\n\n>I know some who grumble and say: If all were to abstain from procreation, how would the human race continue to exist? Would that all wanted to abstain! provided it were done in love, from a pure heart, with a good conscience, and sincere belief, then the kingdom of God would be realized far more quickly, since the end of the world would be hastened.\n\n
These protests are spontaneous without any group offering financial support. 
What, some of your Fillon-supporting friends will vote for Hamon? From the social conservative to a cannabis legalising candidate, from "many working people have the feeling that they work for those who don't" to basic income. I can only be happy about it.
Because what do you know about the Dutch Labour party?
I don't know if you're sarcastic about congratulating Kosovo: since you support an independent Srpska, would you agree to recognition of Kosovo too?
Anyone else who enters the second round.
Could you expand on why you think that of Nietzsche?\n\nHe opposes the main claim of Buddha, Schopenhauer etc about the worthlessness of life:\n\n>They encounter a sick or a very old person or a corpse, and right away they say ‘life is refuted!’\nBut only they are refuted and their eyes, which see only the one face of existence.
No.  She says she's good to go.  
> What depressed me after leaving religion is that evil is probably not an outside force but bad comes from humans.\n\nWhich religion did you leave? Since christianity says that all evil comes from humans; fall of man, the original sin, everyone is born sinful.
Yes, his promise to dismantle the welfare state (in France!), his open contempt of the poor and also not being that far away from Le Pen on social issues and immigration, would make it very hard for left-wing voters to vote for Fillon. 
With mandates you refer to constituency-representatives? Such a thing does not exist in Dutch elecions, there are only lists. Wilders composes the list of his party himself. So everyone is obedient in order to remain on the list for the next election. Everyone who dissents gets kicked out of the fraction *immediately*.\n\nEspecially on provincial level he lost dozens of seats. On national level he lost "only" 3 out of 15.
>You don't seem to understand\n\nYou don't seem to understand my question. I asked several times if the Catalan government will go for the nuclear option, but instead you seem to attack an imaginary pro-Catalan independence foe:\n\n>Don't even think for a second that Spain will abandon all those catalans that feel Spanish.\n
Because Mélenchon supporters don't want a candidate they think might do a Tsipras and oppose the policies of the PS of the last 5 years.
(And que j'avais=which I had.) Exactly :)
It sounds like what the Pope Francis did was reasonable, and that Burke/Festing didn't want an independent investigation to happen, shielding behind: "don't involve yourself with us, we are sovereign". 
What do you think of Die Linke, and how accurate is their portrayel of a party "which doesn't want to govern anyway"?
That's absolutely correct! Cool that you know this fact. \n\nIt enables him to rule his party like a dictator, everyone's job depends on his whim. His supporters don't care of course or don't even know it.
Why can't the constitutional court stop an unconstitional bill? And can the proposed referendum reverse it?\n
Two translations are posted on /r/Mainlander/ :) 
He votes for their version of the FPÖ. The EU is even more foreign for them. Not surprising he thinks like that, you have these people in many EU-countries.\n
Oh okay that's bad. Are there decent parties you can choose in elections?
Since they are split, it seems that they don't have a chance. A small hope is that the PS primary winner Hamon is very close to Melenchon, which is why Hamon tries to make a deal with Melenchon. But it's unlikely that after months of work, Melenchon would give up on his movement.\n\n\n\n
The last one, as far as I know no one with the Vatican flair lives there.
Maybe this is what you search: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Belgium)
What would "Wilders" happening mean? Maybe his party can become big. But it's sure that he won't be a coalition partner.
So do you think that the Catalan government will declare independence after a succesful referendum? Without the acceptance of the Spanish government.
> I believe we do have a collective responsibility towards each other to be truthful to one another and not mystify death as those who mystify life.\n\nAnd then you write:\n\n>we should be as equally honest of not knowing what death entails to our conscious.\n\nBut you just said let us not mystify death!\n\nConsciousness is only imaginable for living beings, life is prerequisite for consciousness. I hope you can agree on this non-mystifying sentence. \n\n*But if you say* maybe there actually is consciousness outside life, then you're mystifying death. \n\n
Agree.\n\n>We must destroy this universe in its entirety and prevent any further suffering that it most definitely will inevitably cause.\n\nWell that's already happening, in the sense that everything gets pulled apart at a rate which gets faster and faster, and no one has a single clue why it happens lol. The universe is doomed to dissolve into non-exitence :) \n\n
>If you were brought from nothingness into a sentient being.\n\nWe are created by our parents? It's like building a house (with consciousness) which afterwards says: wow, I was created out of nothingness! 
Most elections have been relatively "expected" with two famous shock elections, the 2002 one with Le Pen going to the second round, and the 1981 Mitterand election.\n\nBut this first round is one of the most unpredictable ever, with the only given seems to be Le Pen entering the second round.
Fantastic!
Philipp Mainländer. There is no English translation of his work, I have started translate a little bit myself so that people can read at least something of it. I think that I'll post it in a few days.
Oh, translations of this philosopher can be found on /r/Mainlander.
Do you think I suggested that Swiss politics are black and white?\n\nThe Swiss system has some features which I like, which are luckily adopted in the European Union (inclusive government with all major parties), protections for even the smallest languages, but instead of referenda (would be strange on EU-level if other countries could force their opinion on other countries) veto powers for every member state.
>They won't cause it would be ilegal, since they would break the art 1 of the Spanish constitution\n\n\nBecause in case of a *unilateral* declaration of independence [that constitution is irrelevant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence). Why would the nuclear option be off the table.
No just an anonymous redditor.
Which city did you live in? I heard something about Graz having a strong KPÖ. 
He had two children, they both died very young.
Wow! Keine Bremsen. I have to be honest that I didn't expect this much high energy, but he seems to be unstoppable in the polls. I underestimed this train.
Fillon isn't much better than Le Pen, he's anti-immigration and an extreme social conservative but with open contempt for the poor. Le Pen Vs Fillon is choosing between the destruction of the French welfare state or the destruction of Europe. 
In the first place society shouldn't let people live in poverty but give basic human rights to everyone. The children should get the best possible education like all of us. \n
There are charities which distribute contraceptives in poor countries! [If women got the contraception they wanted, unplanned pregnancies would drop by 70%](http://www.womancareglobal.org/)
The way I worded it made it sound too certain, I agree.
If you see that you make someone happy, before your own eyes, that really fulfills one with joy. So helping someone is something which can continue to motivate me, like hunger will motivate me to full my stomach, although I know that it's senseless.\n\nAs for motivation in general, it's a problem for me too. 
For which party do you vote?
Oh, I'm sorry that I gave false hope about living in a special country! No one with a Vatican flair lives there as far as I know. \n\nMay I ask what party you will then vote for? Since the Greens were also in power during the Schröder reforms, there doesn't to be much choice on the left.\n
There are many things which we have discussed before in this post ;-) 
They doesn't sound very different from the radical-left in France which is always around 10%, and as a more extreme version of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands. Thanks for your detailed answer :-)
I have to disappoint.
Thanks, the article seems to say that they'll go for the nuclear option.
You share this with Buddha, Schopenhauer, Tolstoy and Gandhi.
In the Netherlands you need to form coalitions in order to govern, just being big doesn't matter. All major parties, even the right-wing parties which Wilders once governed with and betrayed, now reject any possibility of giving him power.
If you had aborted them you would have spared them two lifetimes of suffering.\n\n>They're the joy of my life now.\n\nTypical selfishness of breeders. 
Which is why it doesn't make sense for Fillon-supporing persons to vote Hamon first round.
Europe has the best bridges, we really do.
Because of the two-round system it's almost impossible for Le Pen. In the departmental elections FN couldn't even win in regions where they got 40%. 
I thought you recommended going to India and Nepal? By the way, what is the reason you delete all your comments?, it's a waste of AN thoughts.
8% for coalitions, 5% for parties.
Gnostic religions and Jainism. 
Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, humans should stop procreating because we destroy nature. AN says that life itself is bad.
As far as I know the whole Tanakh is accepted by all Jews (that's why your comment surprised me), it's the direct continuation of Jewish history as started in the Torah until the Babylonians came.
Not that I know of, but google gives a wikipedia article about the concept Psychological egoism, so maybe that's what you search?\n\nI think that you give a very good example.\n\nAnd for the philosopher I mentioned, he says that all ethics is *eudemonology*, art of happiness. The greatest morality leads to the highest degree of inner happiness.
Liberal again? What kind of liberalism are you referring to?
No, but they don't get state funding in exchange.\n
Romantic and sexual urges were clearly stronger than principles at that time. It's not uncommon to have recognized the suffering which pervades all life but still not being able to free oneself from its temptations.\n\nHe had *two* children by the way.
Keine Bremsen. After the three glorious European elections this year high energy will make the Eurozone economy unstoppable.
By the way, what do you think of the current Albanian government? It's hard for me as an outsider to get more than shallow information, my impression is that the current one is an improvement to Berisha's.
Nothing kills off birth rates like good education, access to contraceptives. That's all you need for falling below the replacement line. People love sex, not necessarily children.\n\nGetting rid of the welfare state in order "to wake people up" gives African birth rates. People breed a lot in refugee camps.
I think it's Antinatalism from a time where contraceptives didn't exist. In buddhism life is recognized as suffering, celibacy was required to prevent rebirth. I think this is the reason for the difference between buddhism and hinduism/jainism. In jainism extreme ascetism is required in order to free onself from rebirth, while Buddha only demanded being celibate and moderate.\n\nI think that in hinduism/jainism two things get mixed. Not having children is required for not experiencing rebirth, salvation after death. Whether one uses contraceptives or celibacy is the same. But for this life, ascetism is only a method to escape from the sufferings of this life. Ascetism is "salvation", inner happiness which these philosophies promise, in *this* life. \n\nCelibacy is achieving **two** goals.
I want to add that in Mainländer's idealism, individuality is *real*. The world is not a single thing-in-itself without number as in Schopenhauer's philosophy (a metaphysical Will), but a collection of many things-in-themselves (*individual* Wills). M had written about his own distinction already so that's why he is so short about suicide here. 
All people of Afghanistan I know hate Pakistan with passion for funding the taliban, claiming Pakistan wants a failed state.
Ah, okay. Macron makes much sence. I was surprised to hear that some of them consider voting for the left-wing Hamon who as it stands now will most likely not enter the second round.
For the reason mentioned above: in the deparmental elections she could get over 40% of the votes in very FN-favourable departments, but lost anyway because the opposing candidate got all other votes in the second round. Nationally she doesn't poll around 40% but 25%.
There is no evidence. Japan places its money on robotification. I expect this to continue since that's a lot cheaper than massive government spending programs to get young people breeding.
What is this nonsense? How can you be in Kosovo while not realizing you're in a seperate country, you get a stamp in your passport, they use the euro not dinar, they even have buildings with walls where is written "Thanks for recognizing Kosovo" with a list of all countries who do.
We will see. But I don't see how Europe's and Japan's population will ever have fertility above replacement rate again. \n\n*the original European population
I agree. 
I will.

It must be fantastic to be able to read all those great philosophers without any barrier!
False equivalence.
It's part of their Tanakh.
That's what Mainländer claims too (as opposed to Schopenhauer): if someone with much compassion sees someone suffering, and she doesn't help him, is she happy? If she wouldn't help him she would be deeply unhappy. In order to free herself she has to help him, and is rewarded with good feelings of deep satisfaction.\n\nThe saint only seemingly acts selfishness, he wants his own salvation above everything! 
We can as safely ignore this idea as solipsism or other impossible to disprove theories.\n\n>For a start, how is the existence of the other universes to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on the slippery slope between that and the idea that there are an infinite number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to scientific verification. Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but in essence it requires the same leap of faith.
Hmm, I think it would be easier to help you if you pointed out exactly what you wanted to know. Its kind of hard to explain everything from the ground up.
I think one of the biggest challenges (and the list you provide makes this obvious) is that one needs political support for such a measure to gain traction and to pass. I can't imagine there was much of an organized movement with political backing to try and pass this in Colorado. Furthermore, if you look at states that have in the past implemented Single payer (such as Vermont I believe) one sees the fatal flaw of integrating the system in small states. Single payer requires the state to be able to negotiate fair pharmaceutical and medical service costs. Unfortunately such an undertaking takes considerable leverage, which individual states just don't have, causing the failure in such small states. Perhaps voters in Colorado were aware of this. I think, unless there is some federal price negotiation going on, state level single payer is only possible in the biggest of states. On the federal level, the gained negotiation power would make single payer far cheaper.
I suppose the same is true for those who say they would vote for Hillary now. Probably a Hillary supporter disguised as a Bernie supporter...\n\nSee what I did there.\n\nAlthough I agree, I will not vote for Trump. 3rd Party for me, probably Jill Stein.
Is there a certificate of authenticity included with the sticker?
Did you reply to someone else? What matters? what should I explain?
Fighting corruption and money in politics should be the priority, not partisanship...
A government run by the people is libertarian, a government run by special interests and the powerful interest groups is authoritarian. This campaign is about the more libertarian approach.
Sorry the following got a bit long, I started to ramble a bit...\n\nI have no problem with either health care system, what is important is that the people, not some small authoritarian elite, chose what sort of system is implemented and they are properly informed about it. I would not trust the current government to be doing just about anything, whether it is the surveillance system we have now, or some health care system. The government now, however, is not run by the American people, but by a small elite. When the government is back in the control of the people, and these people make the informed decision to implement a single payer system, it is the will of the people, and not some ruling class. Of course there will always be some who complain about the tyranny of the majority, but a democracy is perhaps the most libertarian society that we can conceivably achieve, while still protecting ourselves from small groups gaining too much influence and power.\n\nMy view of libertarianism rests to a large degree on the influence of power. To ensure libertarianism, everyone needs to have the power over their own destiny. This requires power to be well distributed, for example, in the form of a strong middle class. It is the responsibility of the middle class to maintain it, and to ensure their fellow citizens remain a part of it. Poverty and a huge wealth gap is the death of libertarianism. So in my belief, it is important and in fact in the self interest of every member of the middle class to implement policy which works to maintain and strengthen it. Single payer, or a public option may be an example of such policy.\n\nIn regards to trust of the government, in my view the government just serves power. Therefore government is as trustworthy as the power that runs it. If the people are responsible and trustworthy, and they run the government, then the government is also responsible and trustworthy.
NASA has already been gutted under Obama... I can't imagine Hillary will somehow bring them back.
Last time I checked, independents are part of the people, most of which were not allowed to partake in the primary. General election polls show Bernie outperforming Clinton against Trump. Too bad we can't get a more official number through primaries that include all people. After all, we all pay for these primaries with our taxes, directly and indirectly, why shouldn't everyone be permitted to partake?\n\nNevertheless, most of us are not just interested in the Primary, but also the smaller elections and the greater movement started by Bernie. 
Ok, so people support progressive ideas like single payer, but don't agree on how to best implement it. How does this make them less progressive? One of the polls even asked if they would support single payer if it meant higher taxes. \n\nWe have plenty of laws which don't pass, even though most Americans agree, such as closing tax loopholes and doing something about tax havens. But as we saw in the Princeton study, most laws which are passed serve predominantly the rich. They get support for these laws, partially through their well funded political machine, the same machine that keeps stopping progressive policy.
These people seem to forget how upset they were when Obama won. 
I agree with you as well, but you must realize, whether we do it via a 3rd party or via the Democrats, the only way to change the country, is if we act. Right now, this movement is acting, which is why I am working with it. I hope the Trump presidency wakes a lot of Americans up from their complacency. Perhaps enough will become active, such that we can change American politics completely.\n\nI follow Jordan Chariton and the DAPL situation closely, and I agree with most of what he says. \n\nWe must not just elect officials that will change this, we must pressure them to keep serving Americans, otherwise they will go back to being controlled by the 1%. This is not just a matter of installing more progressive persons in position of power, we also need to rework our media, our education, our culture, to be able to do what we strive for. This is a large undertaking and will likely take our entire lives, if not multiple generations to accomplish.
but thats the problem, its a monopoly. If it were community run, this wouldn't be quite as big a problem. Another goal of this campaign is to end the militarization and centralization of law enforcement. In the end it comes down to whether people are willing to get off their ass and do something about it. A society can only be libertarian, if it takes care of itself, not when it leaves the job to whoever happens to take it...
"I didn't hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she's the nominee. I think he's accepted that," Reid said\n\nSo this now means "Sanders Has Accepted Clintons Win"?
All I can say:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP8QdFttugg
I'm glad he got it together but yea, they need his glove in there. 
The American healthcare system is among the most inefficient systems in the industrialized world. American exceptionalism certainly has shined here my friend! Almost all the industrialized nations have socialized medicine, and they are more efficient than ours. Germany, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Canada, France, Japan... all more efficient. I suppose evidence doesn't get any more blatant than that. To bad the corrupt Republicans and Democrats wont let the Americans purchase their medicine from countries such as Canada, where it is much cheaper.
As far as I heard, Sanders does not want to be inhibited running progressive Democrats against moderates.
I would disagree. Democracy is all about involvement. The more people are involved, the less space for corruption and authoritarian structuring. Government is just a bunch of buildings and papers with some words on them. What the government ultimately does is determined by power players. This can either be the people, big moneyed interests, some big multinational corporate monopolies, the mafia, or some other influence. This campaigns focus is on fighting money in politics and corruption. To bring back the power to the people. It just so happens that a lot of people would like things like a better healthcare system, that doesn't charge more for medicine and care than any other developed country. And free public education, which isn't plagued with incredibly high tuition costs and more corporate influence. As an American that spends half his time living abroad, I can tell you there are much cheaper more effective options. It just depends how much people want it, and how hard they are willing to work to have a functioning implementation of these ideas. Every form of society inevitably has some form of power structure emerge, the question is, will the people be involved in its organization, or will it be left to the highest bidder.
This is what happens when people are complacent and let the highest bidder take over. They'll solve all the problems, albeit be it in a way that serves their best interests most. It is time for we the people to wake up, and fix the system we let fall into disrepair.
You act as though Ellison is no better than the current establishment leadership of the party. He will represent a considerable shift. He is not perfect, but if you want perfect, you need to be controlling the party. Do you control the party? My thinking is, it will be easier for our movement to influence Ellison, than any of the others currently running for that position. \n\nLook, I am a regular third party voter. I am against war. I would love it if we could get someone into power who will just end the wars and bring peace and prosperity to all. Unfortunately, most Americans will not participate in the 3rd party vote, because we live in a system completely tailored to the two parties in power. If we want change, we need to work through one of these parties, or we need to destroy one of these two parties to replace it.\n\nLet me explain to you my thinking of how this works. I see 2 possibilities for change. \n\n1. We use the Democratic Party, to pass legislation that will give us viable third party choices through reform such as ranked choice voting. This requires us to compromise with current power holders, but with effort in taking over the low levels of the party and working up, we can slowly and organically take over. This means slowly replacing all the problematic power brokers. \n\n2. We wait until the Democratic Party dies, perhaps helping along ourselves, and then help a new party to come to power in its place. Historically, new parties arose when one of the two old major parties had lost the ability to create a majority over long periods of time. The Democratic party had a majority in house and senate just a few years ago, and has the presidency until 2017, they are far from being dead. They are in a valley at best. With the coordinated effort of the entire progressive movement, you might be able to take down the Democrats. Of course that would require you to convince the entire progressive movement to do this, and as we see here, there is very much disagreement with this sentiment. It would take catastrophic failure (imagine election 2016, several elections in a row) before people turned away from the party for good. \n\nI prefer option 1. Our movement has been successful in some states already, taking over the state democratic party. Now they need to push and support their candidates, and soon we will control state houses and senates and more seats in congress and senate.
And here I was thinking she was just another run of the mill Reptilian...
except we have like 1000s of years of experience with breeding. We dont with GMOs. Personally, I think GMOs are just another step to the complete monopolization of crop production. As I said, I have a problem with the implications of the patent system on something like GMOs and  the unknowns of such a relatively young process (a few decades is not long, not even in science), not the health risks. I mean there are a lot of parallels with breeding and Genetic Engineering, but breeding seems to be far more accessible. It's much easier to produce a new crop product through breeding than GMOs. GMOs require lots of certifications and expertise (which breeding does not) which limits competition. 
what you do, don't ever give up.
This sites point 4 has some info on Student ID requirements. In case your friend has a Student ID.\n\nhttp://www.in.gov/sos/elections/2401.htm
One has to look at why the working class white men are turning to xenophobia and racism. One needs to realize that many of these people are struggling, perhaps not as much as some minorities, but they are struggling non-the-less. And when the Democrats promise to help the African Americans or the Immigrants in America, what are the poor white told by the conservatives of America? "When they pass legislation, to help the poor black man, they will take away from the little resources currently used to help the poor white man". And in a way, they are right. Because in conservative America, who do you think pays for welfare programs? The government dare not raise taxes on the rich, so the poor take another hit, with sequestration and welfare cuts. The few resources available to Americas poor are stretched ever thinner. \n\nWhat is the solution? We make clear we wish to help ALL struggling Americans. We are as inclusive as possible and we make it clear, it is those who took all the money from the American middle class who will pay for this, and not the diminishing American middle class, the top 1 Percent. We work to improve employment for all, we work to bring the minimum wage up for all, we will work to stop the conservatives from redistributing the money of the poor in the politics of divisiveness. No longer will the races be pitted against each other, to protect the interests of the richest Americans.
Well, capitalism, much like socialism, is a very broad term. Politics is more of a continuum between extremes. Capitalism in its purest form is not the same as Bernie Sanders politics. Neither is Socialism in its purest form. The better question is, what does it mean to be against capitalism? What does it mean to be against Socialism? Do either positions even make sense?
Hmm maybe they want us to think that we think that they are only infiltrating us to get us to be suspicious of one another? Whether or not they are doing these things is hard, if not impossible to verify. The best course of actions is just to continue working towards what we all as individuals think is best. Just keep researching the facts, and using them in all discussions. If we stay vigilant, the truth will prevail.
If for any other reason, to have some amount of leverage. If the democrats don't give us a reason to vote for their candidate, we'll find an alternative. Bernie as a 3rd party might be one. As long as that leverage exists, they might consider working with us. Or perhaps some other party might be willing to work with us first? A thought that should stick in their minds. It's just good business. I wont allow them to screw this movement, or myself over.
This is the first time I saw him mentioning the white working class like this. I think it is important to be as inclusive with all groups of poor and middle class Americans as possible. Even Martin Luther King Jr. mentioned the white poor in his speeches. I think having to mention individual races at all is absurd. We are all, after all, Americans. But in a day where you constantly throw out how we need to protect the African Americans, Latino Americans, and LGBT Americans from Trump, one should also remember the other races and groups. We need to work together. True or not, unfortunately many white working class and poor feel like the democrats are neglecting them, instead pandering to minority groups. No race should be treated better or worse by the state. We need a solution that helps all poor and struggling people in America. From Sanders history, I know he wishes to help all Americans.
I think the 2nd option is riskier. We would have to get all our influential allies in politics on board, in order to ensure the voters jump ship with us. Not just that, all the work we would have to do to elect our people into office under a 3rd party, would not be easier than voting our people into office under the Democratic party. Also, I think its hard to find the backing for it at this time. You must remember, most Democrats are not so pissed, that they would abandon the Democratic party.\n\nAs to the mind tricks you speak of. I hear you, it is a difficult battle. At every turn we will meet resistance, at every turn they will try to break us. No one said this would be easy. I am angry as well. I have been angry for a long time with how the government is run. The charade that is the war in the middle east. The surveillance state. The unaware elite having the say. The broken education, justice, healthcare, and prison systems. My only hope is, that we don't lose ourselves to complacency again. Whether with a 3rd party, or with the Democrats, I think most important of all is that we fight. As Bernie said: "Never, ever lose your sense of outrage!"
You throw around accusations without making an argument as to why, and call me hypocritical? Oh woe be me. I ought to be punished and beheaded, for I did not befit the purity tests of this fellow Revolutionary.... Perhaps you can point out why you think that, I can hardly improve myself if the only thing you do is throw around accusations.
You don't care*\n\nCorrected that for you...
The winner take all system we have in this country essentially forces a 2 party system. Its the winner take all that forces people to do the "strategic voting" which leads them to vote against a candidate rather than for one. We would have to solve that problem, before we could have a long term solution to the 2 party system.\n\nEven if we had a minor party or a 3rd major party, it would be temporary. In the end, people will align with 1 of only 2 parties...
This was a well publicized event, and is not one of the closed door speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs for which everyone wants to see the transcripts.
Its not like capitalism goes away in social democracy. Look at all other social democracies around the world. They still have free market, corporations, the ability to work up the latter with hard work and get rich...\n\nThe idea that people become lazy with single payer health care seems absurd to me. How does a single payer health care system allow people to stay home to avoid work? Unless of course you mean when they are sick and recovering? Sick people that work get other people sick and recover slower. Also people with proper health care and recovery time are under less stress and more productive. People who are unemployed don't get food or shelter from a single payer health care, and are forced to work one way or the other.
Now see, that wasn't so hard. Now I can make an argument, instead of getting into a pointless pissing match with you.  \n\nComparing Clinton to Ellison? I don't think you know just how bad a candidate Clinton was. \n\nNow, to the point about Ellison: that is like literally what I have been advocating. We the people need to enact change, because politicians wont do it for us. I mean, sure I could have added that qualifier in my first post, but I made up for it in my responses to /u/Anunaik, I promise. So please, just read them and see for yourself. We don't disagree so much after all.\n\nPlease don't accuse me of things without reason again.
I agree. We have a steep hill to climb...
So they are trying to say the problem with Clinton was, she was too far to the left? I suppose that explains why 23% of people who wanted a more liberal president than Obama voted for Trump...\n\nThis is the problem the Democrats been having for the past few decades, always shifting right. These people...
Jill Stein was my choice in 2012 and my first choice until Bernie decided to run in 2016. I suppose if Bernie is not on the Ballot, I will vote for Jill Stein. Although I could be convinced to vote another 3rd Party candidate strategically.
That's odd, I've only received like 3 in total throughout the election. I wonder why you are receiving so many...
I miss this meme
Details? When has she fought against bank monopolization or their criminal activity? Going there and telling them to cut it out and then getting several hundred thousand dollars does not impress me. What about the interventionalism and hawkish approach to war? What about her statement that she has not budged on her policy platform due to Sanders? What credible indication has she given she will fight Citizens United? Or remove Superdelegates? Or work for more open free elections? What work has she done to end the Monopolization of huge corporations and banks? How does her previous support for trade deals translate to working to stop them and reverse them? What work has she done against the military, pharma, and prison industrial complexes? What about her position on fracking?\n
This may work with casual supporters. But the core of her support will not be convinced even if Hillary screwed up royally right in front of them. They are in her team, that is all they care about... red vs blue... us vs them....\n\nThis isn't about the issues to these people...
I am not saying that we should lose ourselves to compromise, only that if you expect our politicians to do anything for us, it wont happen. We must do this ourselves. Is this too difficult for you to understand? If you want to change something, you need to do it yourself. We all have no power, not because we are powerless, but because we are complacent. We have allowed the takeover of our government, and the only people that will change this, is us. If you want better leadership, infiltrate the Democratic party, from the bottom up. We need to build up our leverage 1 step at a time, first Ellison, then we move to bigger prizes. To put the perfect candidate in the leadership positions, we need to control large portions of our government. Until we do, we need to compromise.  We do it like a bulldog, we bite, we don't let go, and we inch ever closer to the throat. 
The title is misleading, it was 23% of people who wanted a more liberal president than Obama who voted for Trump, not 23% of Trump voters.
Nothing like a Clinton supporter admitting that the only appealing thing about Clinton is Trump. If one of them wants my vote, they have to work for it. Its simple business. I don't care who of the two wins, because I see the end of all the things I hold dear under both. Convince me otherwise.
From what I hear he can fill out the provisional ballot, and leave the part swearing to being a registered democrat blank.
This has gotten pretty bad recently. It appears like a tactic to appear like the great majority, they intimidate people on all platforms. Similar to Fascist tactics in pre WWII. It may end when they got their victory out of their system, but what if not?
She has made the point that she doesn't have to pick up any of his policies to win the election against Trump several times. So much for a candidate who keeps going on about the importance of compromise and working with the other team. I suppose she will do that only with the Republicans.\n\nAlthough, would you trust her to actually follow through on Sanders Policies she picks up, if she said she would? After all the things I've seen from her, I sure wouldn't. So her promises mean very little to me.
I have some coworkers who back Trump. I think they are just living in a different circle of people, surrounding themselves with different mindsets and seeking out different sources of information. I think a lot of Trump supporters were just sick of being marginalized, there seems to be this feeling that they were liberated and are free to speak their minds now. Of course we know what kind of stuff was on their minds... seeing what they are saying on social media and in person...\n\nThey are convinced, that all sources of corruption is a symptom of liberalism, just like many on the left think it is a symptom of conservatism. Perhaps they were just upset with all the establishment arrogance, the same arrogance we are facing.
The effect on price of goods on the overall market is perhaps even smaller, considering the huge majority of wages already go to people making more than 15$ (considering top 10% earners make almost 50% of the money). 
OK, so there is disagreement on the Princeton study, I do enjoy being given some new information every now and then, and I thank you for that. My point still stands however, that most people agree with single payer. Disagreement on details doesn't make them less progressive. I would argue that disagreement with taxes arises mostly from the fact that so many Americans are poor and couldn't afford more Taxes. If we still had a big and strong middle class, this may be different. \n\nRegarding Americans being uninformed, I would agree (I think people pushing this fact onto the uninformed ultimately led to the backlash, that is President Trump). Perhaps the reason why Americans are so uninformed is because of the growing education gap, much like the growing wealth gap. Trust in Science is shrinking. That coupled with the constant misinformation spread through media, which I would argue work in their own financial interest and interest of their sponsors. Not to forget, simply the information that is under-reported, or not reported at all. I would argue that the moneyed interests, which to a large degree come from corporate interests, influence these public views by exploiting the fact that people are uneducated and uninformed.
As far as I hear, the question is not whether GM foods are safe to eat, but whether people have the right to know they are buying GM foods. I personally have problems with GM foods, not due to health concerns, but out of the implications of patented DNA.
I would rather vote for a Republican with a good track record fighting corruption and money in politics, than a Democrat like Wassermann Schultz. Let's not make this about red or blue.
The enemy of our enemy is our friend? Only the sith deal in absolutes...
Giving up is the only certain way to lose!
We can make demands whenever we want. The question is whether they will be heeded? That depends on how many of us and how much we insist. If the movement continues to grow, as it has over the years, it is only a matter of time. I've stopped trusting the flawed 2 party system a long time ago. 3rd Party is the way to go, if we want to end it. Screw the mentality of voting for the lesser evil, screw the mentality of backing a candidate out of fear, screw the mentality of "oh if you don't vote for one of the 2 sponsored candidates, the other will surely win". I mean, after all, Bernie won as an Independent in his home state...
Thanks for clarifying.\n\nHere are some issues that are important to me.\n\n * End the wars and interventionalism.\n * maintain a free internet\n * fight corruption\n * break up the military industrial complex\n * break up the pharma industrial complex\n * break up the prison industrial complex\n * election reform\n * end citizens united\n * end military authorization act\n * end patriot act\n * remove superdelegates\n * jail bankers who broke the law\n * reinstate glass steagal\n * fight monopolization\n * fight trade policies that benefit only big corporations, and screw the average person in both the US and the countries we do trade deals with\n\nThese are just off the top of my head.\n\nEdit: added a few points to the list
Thanks for sharing, I agree with most of your points.\n\nAccording to the political compass, it turns out I am center left libertarian... I knew that!
You can always check out congress.gov if you are ready for some dry reading. They have all the voting records on there.\n\nYou made the comparison to sports, I think there are some parallels. Just like sports, you sort of have to follow it for a while to get into it. Watch political analysis, interviews, articles, discuss with other persons. \n\nWhen researching politicians, I would focus on those you may have greater influence over, such as the representatives of your state and district. Really its good idea to look at a variety of political analysts and news sites, and see which ones seem to work the best for you. You can always check /r/Political_Revolution for news, but make sure not to get stuck in a news bubble. Google and Wikipedia are also good places to look for information, although you should be wary of false information. Wikipedia has the added bonus of having up to hundreds of citations, which can be used to verify and gain additional information. It's always best to verify information which seems important. \n\nI think overall, no single person who works for a living can be expected to research absolutely everything themselves. That's why its important to find good journalists and analysts who compile information in a trustworthy way. That's something that's going to take a while to find. I wouldn't presume to know the one true source of information, its something everyone needs to figure out for themselves. All I can tell you to be aware of bias, which exists in all sources of information.\n\nI like watching political commentary from people like liberal viewer (who is a bit more pro establishment) jordan chariton and jimmy dore (who are a bit more anti-establishment) on youtube, but that's a personal preference. \n\nI'm sorry, I am perhaps not the best person to help you. Most of the information I have about the histories and positions of politicians and those operatives involved in politics are things I picked up following politics for years. I don't know of any one place where all this information would be neatly compiled for you. I am sure it will all become clearer as you involve yourself with this topic for a while.
What about FDR after Hoover? We hardly had as many people in poverty in 72 as we do now. It is, if anything, more comparable to the 30s, when there was also great poverty. 
In that case perhaps the argument: A cooperative society is more productive than a bunch of individuals competing against each other. \n\nBut then again, if a person doesn't see the point in helping out our fellow man, why would he vote for Sanders?
What is this guy on about. Are these supposed to have something to do with Sanders?\n\nIf this guy has a problem with taxes, then perhaps a better analogy for him to understand it would be. If a person uses tools, knowledge, and infrastructure, built by the generations of people that came before him, and maintained and built upon by the people that live beside him, to build a product to sell for a profit. Is it fair to ask him to share some of his profits to maintain this infrastructure?
effect does not mean it makes it poisonous. It means it changes something. In order for there to be a purpose in using GMOs, it obviously needs to change something, for instance to make it grow better, otherwise it be kind of pointless.
Willkommen in Amerika. My own experience was similar, what shocked me the most was the pledging of allegiance every day at school. Or the flags literally everywhere. But I suppose it is not much different in other countries. Germany is perhaps bit a weird, in that hey sort of tried to tone down nationalism and militarism after WWII.\n\nEdit: I came here before 9/11, so I don't think thats what did it
Bernie Sanders can endorse and campaign for Hillary all he wants. But if he has nothing to show for it, he's gonna have a hard time convincing the movement to back Clinton. The problem with Clinton is that saying she will do a thing is not good enough, many of us do not trust her word. We need something concrete, that will give us a reason to back Clinton. Right now she is acting as though she doesn't have to do a thing for our votes.
So is Putin, whats his point?
That's something a Clinton supporter would say /s\n\nBut in all seriousness, I guess you didn't read any of my other posts on this thread. Or do I have to prove my "Loyalty" here now. Let us not become what we are fighting, OK?
well, there is the possibility of plausible deniability. The establishment and friends of Hillary are doing it without her knowledge...
To some people a crisis is nothing more than an opportunity...
I don't think you're reaching him...
I thought TPP is just on hold until Trump is in office, at least thats what I heard.
Here you go accusing me again. Do you have nothing better to do? Use that anger of yours and do something constructive.
In a way, Hillary Clinton is siphoning all the money that would otherwise go to the local contests. Progressive candidates get their money from the grassroots, so they are less affected. This may be an opportunity for the progressives to win more local primaries.
Well then Dean can't do the DNC job and work as a Lobbyist. 
you forgot /s
If you are in Austria, you probably wont see the results until tomorrow morning...
I think Bernie struck a deal with Schumer to try and get a hand in rebuilding the party. We shall see. But as Bernie said, change doesn't come from the top down. It is our job to clear away the corruption.
Its an investment. If you want a properly run company, you ensure that it is well kept, professionally run, the employers are well educated, and the products are produced with a high quality. If you want a society to be healthy and productive, you need to ensure a minimum standard. Poverty, stress, and health issues lead to a breakup of society. Crime and violence goes up, the government become more authoritarian, as people are less capable to be involved in politics, and so on. \n\nIts sort of like that study they did with rats. Two sets of rats, one living in cages, the other living in a "rat park" (essentially a more ideal environment for the rats). Both rats had access to normal water and water with morphine. Guess which rats consumed considerably more morphine!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park
How dare you challenge the plutocracy! Know your place!\n\n/s
Long term solutions are only viable if we have the power to implement them. First we must obtain said power. Of course, in the end, it all relies on us, the people, not becoming complacent again. Long term success, requires long term involvement. This is the case with everything, be it the Justice Democrats, your workplace restructuring, or any other political movement.
I wonder how many of those tweets are from our friends at CTR.
The problem is, just like there is a wealth gap, there is starting to be an education gap. Trust for science is dropping... how do we educate people, who feel that this entire notion is just some elitist nonsense? 
As I've said before, the only certain way to lose, is to give up.
A lot more is needed to end the 2 party system. We would have to get rid of this winner take all, that essentially forces a 2 party system.
If there is anything I learned from politics the last few years, is that if you want something done, you can't rely on the government to do it for you. You need to use leverage and what little power you have to give the government no other choice. Ellison, while not perfect, is much better than what we have now, and will hopefully give us a foot in the door.  
In business, If I have something the other guy wants, he has to offer me something for it. If I give it to him for free, and hope to get some sort of thank you, I am a loser. If this movement was to endorse Hillary Clinton, without having some guarantee of return, Hillary will probably win and we get nothing out of it. \n\nTo me, a Clinton win isn't necessarily better than a Trump win. I realize people like to throw out the Trump name to remind people of their place. A way to scare them into voting for Clinton. I am not impressed. Clinton has not shown me a reason to trust her, as such any promises she makes are worth little to me. When I look at her history, I see a war hawk, who dislikes immigrants, who will risk perpetual war for this country, who like to do business behind closed doors with some of the biggest crooks in this world against the interest of the US population. What could Trump possibly do worse? Unless this changes, say because one of said parties makes a compromise with this movement, which we are confident enough in that it will be adhered to by all parties, then we may just endorse that party. If that is Hillary, great, if it is Trump, great.\n\nIt's quite simple, we have something you guys want, we want something you guys have. If a compromise is not the consequence you see from such a situation, you are living in a dream world. 
its not about the issues with these people. They are only concerned about having their "team" win. Chose a color and stick with it...
Bernie Sanders has always worked with members of the establishment to get amendments into bills to serve the interest of the broader public. There is a reason they called him the Amendment King. It's the same he is doing now. It is up to us to take down the Corporate Democrats and replace them with our people. Otherwise our allies, like Sanders, will be forced to compromise forever.
Aye
apparently it is possible to leave the part about being a registered democrat blank
Having to chose Trump or Clinton is like having to select your mode of death in a suicide booth. Rather than doing that, I'll take the third option that has always been available, and vote for someone else. Why should I have my arm twisted to vote for someone I don't want for a president?
As far as I am concerned, Clinton and Trump may as well be on the same Ticket. 
What were the 5 stages of grief again?
Are you suggesting the GMO has no affect on the product? Why then use GMO? Look, GMO is a relatively new thing (especially when compared to breeding). Long term consequences are yet to be determined. I mean, what if someone in the Genetic Engineering screws up and we have wheat that produces prions, or other difficult to detect proteins. What about the implications of genetic ownership? Could I just make a retrovirus with a patented DNA, that then infects entire species of crops and injects DNA, forcing all food production to pay fees to the patent owner? There are a lot of questions that remain unanswered, simply because we are dealing with something there is no long term experience with. Therefor I think the consumer has a right to know they are purchasing GMOs. 
This page has a result of 8 polls asking about single payer showing most people support it:\n\nhttp://www.medicareforall.org/pages/Chart_of_Americans_Support\n\nAs to why it failed in Colorado, perhaps because the entire health care industry worked to make it fail. Money in Politics might not always hold sway over voters, but the machine we are up against is massive.
I am a left libertarian and support Bernie. I think it is important to understand that libertarianism doesn't mean we can't have a responsible government, it just can't be run by a central power structure, which is the antithesis of libertarianism. In my view, the top priority for the Sanders movement, is to bring back power to the people, and maintain a strong middle class, which is in line with the libertarian Philosophy. In my view a government by the people for the people is libertarian, and a government by strong centralized institutions like corporate trusts and international interests is authoritarian. When the government is run by a responsible people, there should be nothing in the way of them implementing things such as a more efficient single payer healthcare system, as long as it remains one which is maintained and governed by an involved and informed population. \nIf you agree, I think you will fit in quite nicely.
Hmmm, tough choice. Do I want a woman who lies cheats and would sell every last decent part of America to the highest bidder, while only occasionally supporting popular, inconsequential easy policies for good publicity and references for the next election. Or do I want a man who's only successful business has been in selling his family name and appearing on reality shows, who spouts things I'd expect some crazy right wing radio host to say and who has had no position of consequence from which to obtain an informed opinion on what he'd actually do in office. Oh the choices...\n\nBernie or 3rd party it is...
I don't know, from the very beginning the MSM has been saying that Bernie has no chance because Hillary is ahead by so many supers. I wonder if that influenced the vote somewhat...
>Missouri governor Jay Nixon echoed some folksy wisdom against him: “Here in the heartland, we like our politicians in the mainstream, and [Sanders] is not — he’s a socialist.’’\n\n>Nixon would no doubt be shocked to learn of his own state’s history with the red menace. In the early twentieth century, the Socialist Party of America (SP) boasted 135 locals in Missouri. In St. Louis alone, 24 of the city’s 28 wards had a local.\n\n>St. Louis was hardly an anomaly. For the first two decades of the twentieth century, the SP was deeply embedded in American life. In 1912, just eleven years after its founding, the party netted nine hundred thousand votes in the presidential election — 6 percent of the total. Across the country, Socialists won seats on city councils and in town halls. In workplaces from breweries to mines, Socialists served in elected union positions, and locals (and even entire internationals) passed socialist resolutions.
That's no way to speak to this grandmotherly looking person.:)
I hope he breaks a toe stubbing it on the leg of a chair or gets a case of diarrhea.
He  should be constantly reminded about what he is letting happen and how he keeps fucking up by letting it all continue instead of putting a stop to it. He should also be reminded that this is all happening on his watch and  he has a choice to rubber stamp this nonsensical farce rather than derail it like a sensible and responsible person would have by now  on seeing where it's all going.
Damn you, Burlington, VT!  Stop being such a great place to live!
That guy probably had to get away from the wife, family, and friends.
Certainly.  Truckers tea is a legendary taste.  The thick, syrupy consistency, the reddish/brown coloration tells you it was made by a man in his prime.  It's a wonder that drivers the country over will part with bottles for any passerby to enjoy!  Bring some home for the kids.

Correct.   It is selfish and I strongly dislike having people unload their emotional baggage at me as well.  I know the toll that can take.  I did think about her feelings.  That is why I stopped short of unloading this message on her.  I also neglected to tell her many other things.  I used restraint, as I always do.  \n\nYes, she knows the basic gist of my situation as a FA person and my lack of hope in the matter.  In the casual flow of platonic conversation over the years we have known each other, she has learned quite a bit about me and I have learned quite a bit about her, but it has mostly been superficial stuff.  However, she unloaded a significant emotional load onto me quite unexpectedly last Friday.  And this is the crux of my life's dilemma; how to contend with the natural human inclination to want to connect with others while realizing that I cannot indulge in this.  I'm usually good at avoiding emotional intimacy by simple avoidance; I limit my free-form interaction with people and maintain highly superficial, structured interactions with people by really only associating with others within the contexts of my job, the volunteer work, shared interest and hobby groups I participate in.  However, when someone begins opening up to me deeply and strongly, as she did, my natural instinct is to reciprocate, support and commiserate.  I probably would have been better served by stepping away and finding someone else she could talk to who was better equipped for emotionality.  The whole situation started with her expressing her feeling that people in the organization we are both members of are actively avoiding her and finding ways to pass her off to others or have her "sit quietly in the corner and not get in the way".  It is quite obvious to me that her worries are very valid.  A number of others have told me that they don't like her over-eagerness and the complexities her hearing impairment add to the work we do.  She is "A pain in the ass" in the words of a few others.  \n\nShe unloaded a lot of her frustrations with that situation and it devolved into full-on heaving sobbing.  She told me that she has no friends.  She is also estranged from her deeply religious family.  Ultimately, she admitted to me that she has nobody in her life.  She also told me point blank that she has never been in love, in a relationship and never has been physically intimate.  She was in a very vulnerable moment and I, somehow, came off as a non-judgemental confidant she could talk to and I unthinkingly filled that role.  I dislike her initial assumption that I am somehow a go-to person to open up to about things, but I caved in and gave her the opportunity.  I didn't ask for this.  She just started crying at me and I went weak.  In retrospect, I should never have allowed myself to feel pity for her ostricization and never should have allowed myself to be alone with her and thus available for intimate conversation.  I've learned a lot from this incident and have insights on how to avoid such unfortunate entanglements in the future.  I think it best that I just avoid her for now.  I can utilize many of the strategies our peers use to avoid her. \n\nAs to how I would feel if someone told me that they had feelings about me that I knew were not reciprocated?  I'd roll my eyes, but I imagine it would be refreshing for this typical melodrama to work out more efficiently.  If I told someone else that I could not be friends with them because I am utterly ill-equipped to be a friend?  I'd be grateful for the warning and glad to be saved the emotional investment in that dead end.  I'd also take it as a compliment that this person assured me that I am not a damaged freak like them.  Brutal honesty is painful but preferable.  It's like amputating a gangrenous limb before the person goes into toxic shock.  Honestly, I'm mortified for having allowed her to believe I am capable of the humanity to care.
The Trumpeltots are already saying that the archival footage of the Obama inauguration events have been doctored to show larger crowds.  They're "FAAK NOOZ"ing this issue to their distorted world view.   
Heard what?  What did she hear?
It's like he has never heard of JFK. 
"Running out of time"?  I HAVE run out of time.  Technically, as a guy, I know that is not technically true.  I'm sure I am still creating viable sperm.  However, I will not be the old dad.  I doubt I'd live to see my kids graduate high school.  More crucially, though, I feel that to have kids, one must, above all things, have hope.  Hope that their world will be a good, kind and safe one.  That they will have opportunities you did not and a good chance of finding happiness and success in life.  That they will be raised in a nurturing environment that provides for their needs in every way, a sable household, inspiring parents, family and friends around them who can help them live to their potential.  Personally, I have none of this hope.  Our world and nation are spiraling out of control.  I doubt my offspring would even have the opportunities I've had.  All I see is the malingering darkness of a nation in decline, a world of upheaval and inequity and a massive population of buffoons reveling to watch it all burn.  If you have kids and do not hold out hope for their sake, you are selfish sadist and probably only having kids as an exercise in self-gratification.  Furthermore, despite my presently happy situation and station in life,  I am objectively a complete failure in life.  Any children I had would be born into near poverty  and carrying the defective genetic payload I offer.  No.  I am an evolutionary and societal dead end and I know it.  This stops with me.  I'm 43 and done.   
I'm 42.  I half-heartedly gave up in January of 2012.  I had lost my nice laboratory job and, facing poor job prospects, decided to get a CDL license.  I then spent nearly a year driving a tractor trailer around the country.  I lived in the truck.  The solitude was vast and all consuming.  I saw a lot of shit.  It was exciting, interesting, mind-expanding, even, but it was a life cut off from everything.  I decided I didn't like it.  However, I did learn that I am a better person when I'm not close to people.  That is when I didn't so much as give up, as just turned my attentions to other things.  I simply knew, without a shadow of a doubt that I would never find love.  Now, I keep everyone at arm's length, so to speak, and it works out better for everyone.  Now I'm settled into a local driving job and have found that my superficial interactions with coworkers is just enough social activity to keep me sane.  I'll never be in an intimate relationship.  I'm not built for them and my eccentricities are such that I think everyone is better off not getting to know me well.   
I could see a system that combines aspects of tourism and light commuter rail; vintage and new equipment.  I'd love to see Catskill Mountain Railroad give up on their combative hosts in Ulster and run a contract/partnership operation on the Beacon Line running vintage equipment.  Joint operations/consolidation with the Danbury Railroad Museum would be an interesting possibility.  I could see seasonally themed excursions along the whole length of the line on weekends (Polar Express, Thomas visits, Leaf Peeping, etc.)  Given the length of the Beacon Line (Beacon to Hopewell), I think rail dinner nights and evening cocktail trains would be possible, especially if the Maybrook portion (Hopewell to Danbury) was included.  I'm not too familiar with the ROW east of Hopewell; I know it's sparsely populated out there but scenic as hell and in spitting distance of Barton Orchards and other touristy traps popular with the NYC Weekend Invasion.   I know the ROW west of Hopewell better and I could see:  \n\n1.  Main yard, maintenance facility, and major terminal with “historic” restaurant/catering at Hopewell behind Williams Lumber for disembarking tour trains out east.  This will have major parking for weekday commuter use going west as well.  The population of the Town of East Fishkill, of which Hopewell Junction is the community center, comprises approximately 30,000 residents. \n\n2. A smaller station in the Hamlet of Hopewell Junction behind the Acme shopping plaza or the post office with an additional large commuter parking lot.  This drops you off in a pedestrian friendly shopping area.\n\n3. A platform in the Hamlet of Brinckerhoff near Doug Phillips Park with substantial parking.  This gives access to the Fishkill Creek fishing areas and commuter access for the bulk of Fishkill’s suburban populace.  It instantly makes access to MNRR walkable for 3,000 residents.\n\n4.  A station in the Village of Fishkill at the end of Jackson Street to tie into the village center’s dining, shopping, and historic district.  It also provides non-driving access for 2,000 residents to the MNRR via Beacon.\n\n5.  A platform in the Hamlet of Glenham at Washington Ave. by the old Texaco Research property to provide connectivity for any projected large-scale redevelopment efforts for that massive site.  It has tremendous potential with access the Fishkill Creek falls, Mountain views, large open spaces and recreational spaces. \n\n6.  A platform at The Lofts in Groveville (Mill St., Beacon) to service that commuter population, the local industry, and anticipated redevelopment/development in that area.\n\n7.  A station on Main St. Beacon by the falls and The Roundhouse to connect to a highly walkable historic downtown district and the foot of Mt. Beacon’s trails (and potential restoration of the cog-railway up the mountain) and future development.\n\n8.  A platform at Tioronda Ave, by the bridge to Madam Brett Park to interchange with the Scenic Hudson Trail network there.\n\n9. A platform at the Beacon Waterfront with connectivity to MNRR and the Ferry to Newburgh.  You’d also have walking proximity to Scenic Hudson’s Long Dock Park, the River Trail Network and future connectivity to the Fjord Trail to Cold Spring and the Hudson Highlands Trails.\n\nWhy all this?  First, the traffic congestion through Fishkill's Rt. 52/Main Street to and from Beacon Train Station and commuters east of Fishkill is substantial and problematic on most days. It’s bad enough to prompt the DOT to do a major traffic study and develop a plan for a $$$$ village bypass road with two bridges.  A commuter targeted daily AM/PM rail shuttle service from Hopewell and Points east to Beacon Train Station could alleviate it and the tight Beacon parking situation.  I haven’t seen solid figures but Beacon MNRR station supposedly saw 530,000 riders daily in 2006.  A significant portion of them are driving Rt 52, Rt 9D from the suburbs east and clogs up the local roads. \n\nDuring the weekend, service could transition to tourism operations with the longer scenic daytrips going east from Hopewell out to Danbury and a local trolley type of service running to the West from Hopewell to Beacon.  The synergy with existing and future development in Lower Dutchess and Northern Putnam is intense.  The flow of tourists up from NYC to the Mid-Hudson Valley is escalating constantly, especially during the spring and fall.   \n \n
I think that means you have to urinate on him or her.
I would.  Variety is a good thing.
I'm 6ft 4in right now.  Height has done nothing for me except provide a sense of alienation; how defective am  I that my height is not an asset for being desirable?  My height is also a detriment to my crossdressing.  I am an ogre and there is nothing less desirable than an ogre in a dress.  So, I'd like to be rich, which would mean I'd be short and then, at least, my abandoned dream of living as a woman would be at least a little more workable in reality.  If nobody else will love me, at least I could feel more comfortable in my own worthless body.
I prefer not to.  Everyone in their specified boxes.  Coworkers who become friends learn too much about how odd I am.  Sure, if some of us get together for drinks after work, I'll go, but that is very superficial.
What?  What has she heard?
Because I am an utterly insufficient human being. Everybody deserves better.
You mean buttertits?
That would be from the resident, untreated UTI he's been nursing with Ocean Spray for the last four months compounded with advancing renal failure.  But if you ask him, the doctor is wrong.  That ain't Diabeetus; it's just bad food and lack of exercise.\n\nIt scares the crap out of me that there are guys out there like ticking time bombs.  That The Lost Driver Network has to exist to help find them dead in their bunk is a nightmare no family should ever endure.\n\nPlease stay healthy brothers.  
President Donald Trump.  Go ahead; lay on your couch in the dark and let it sink in.  I dare you.  President. Donald. Trump.
I'm being tall completely wrong.
What?  What did she hear?
Let's dispel this notion that the municipal workers didn't know what they were doing. They knew exactly what they were dong! \n\n
Flannel or fleece Pajamas.  I'll never wear them.  Ever.  I'm a nightie, garterbelt, and stockings kind of guy.  Seriously.
That's the point.  Why would I want a bridge to nowhere in my life?  Better to burn it than to have two people spending time and effort maintaining something nobody will ever cross.
good luck.
Yes.  I have no idea.\n
Good luck.  I hope this works out for you.\n\nHonestly, at this point in my life, that situation would horrify me.  I'd immediately question her motives and assume I'm being scammed or victimized for some ulterior motive.  I cannot imagine a circumstance or situation where a woman would willingly seek me out without some unspoken and below-board aim.  I'd already be putting distance between us and constraining the relationship to push her away.  It's unimaginable. 
Not really.  
Reading this and the replies, I now understand all those people fighting each other to buy one of the few remaining snow shovels as every big snow storm hits.  Personally, I've been using the same shovel for 11 years.  It never expires and I know that as long as I do not move south, it will likely snow on my driveway again.  I guess other people enjoy continuously rebuying necessities under duress over and over again.     
I'm quite happy with my current situation.  I've got enough money to live comfortably on a part-time seasonal job (school bus driver).  I use the vast periods of free time to volunteer (firefighter, Habitat for Humanity, local cat shelter, environmental advisory committee).  I have interesting hobbies and interests as well.   I do a lot of things everyone around me says they wish they had the time to do.  I have friends I adore, family I love and am a very active member of my community.  I own my home.  I know I'm fat, but I've managed to change my lifestyle and am now approaching a normal BMI.  Yet here I am.\n\nI'm done externalizing my defects and I own my eccentricities entirely.  I am unabashedly weird.  I'm a crossdressing weirdo.  I know that that is a huge turn-off to any sort of healthy romance.  I know that I offer nothing to anyone as a partner.  The certainty that I am utterly and completely unloveable is an ingrained foundational component of my existence.  I know it with the same certainty that I know the vacuum of space would kill me.  I sometimes suspect that I am not completely human, that something was left out or added that others can sense.  No human could thrive in this emotional sterility.  Yet here I am, thriving and doing it alone.  I have learned to not inflict myself upon others.  No woman wants to be approached by me.  Nobody wants to imagine me wanting them or them wanting me.  So I don't.  Ever.  I am never approached because I am not really human.  There is something about me that is repulsive.  I know it.  My life confirms it.  So, I stay away.  I keep everyone at arms distance, so my abnormality and my neediness doesn't harm them as it has in the past.  \n\nSo, really, besides this necessary maladaptation, I am very happy with my life.  I have learned that happiness is an entirely user defined expectation.  I am happy enough.  It's good enough.  It has to be because it's all I can do.          
I was impaling the can on a length of rebar and lapping it off the rusty metal all this time!?!?
I wear size 15 men's shoes in certain brands.  I can fit in some wide-width size 14's by Sketchers, for example.  So, my issue is primarily width, not length.  I've found that the Pleaser's brand of shoes in women's size 16 fit me comfortably.  I've bought them through Amazon.  Allheelsformen.com also carried large sizes that I have ordered and found to fit great.  It's been a while since I ordered from them, so I don't know how useful they are these days.
The pizza and pizza sounds like the best thing ever.  The best thing ever is like the best thing ever.
Yeah, with taxes.  Like you pay for your fire department and police.  You are, at this very instant, subsidizing the lazy entitlement mentality people who don't know enough to install sprinklers in their homes and hire a security guard for themselves!  Not to mention all those roads an industrious person would have paved themselves to get around.  Why do we coddle these people?   
Speaking as an American, I can endorse this.  It will work as well as amputating your legs at the hips helps to lose weight.

Bacha, Bacha, Bacha Khan.  I feel for you.\nLet me rock you, Bacha Khan.
Well, mate, I did not send it.  Yeah, I'd say many people are the root of their own problems.  I am a defective person and not worth knowing.  If more flawed people would own up to their defects, learn to live with them alone and stop inflicting themselves on others out of the selfish need for companionship, the world would be a happier place.  Telling a blind man he can read if he just tries looking harder isn't helping at all.  When the physiological mechanisms for an activity do not exist, it's better to just adapt to that inadequacy instead of following every false hope and wishful thought in a cycle of behavior that will only cause suffering.  \n\nCheers.
I've tried dating sites that supposedly attempt to extract compatibility information about the users based on interests, personality, mindset, etc. in hopes of moving beyond my utter weakness in making a positive first impression.  One in particular garnered my interests to the extent that I put effort into becoming "part of the community", engaging in blogs, writing blogs, chatting and all this other activity to supposedly let the real me shine though.  Yes, OKCupid consumed large scads of my time, fragile hope and confidence.  It proved to me that even given a preponderance of the sorts of details "women say they REALLY look for in a partner" I don't stand a chance.  I expressed my humor, my feelings, my personality and all that other crap, with complete honesty, openness and uncharacteristic hope, in every venue available to OkCupid users and all I really gained was a more thorough sense of alienation and the utter loss of hope.  I was able to extend my lifetime body of failure experience beyond the geophysical confines of my actual life into a colorful online life interacting with people all across the world.  It was soul crushing.  \n\nTinder is ENTIRELY based on looks and first impressions.  Just as I have learned not to press my bare hand against glowing stove top elements,  I have learned not to place hope in such a futile and inevitably painful process.
That guy was a hero!
Hope is intolerable.  I wouldn't wish hope on anybody.  It's like a cancer that devours happiness.   I wish I could teach people to lose hope and all the wasted effort and anguish it causes.\n\nGood luck.  
That I am content to live in this state in perpetuity.  I have found what one might call a happy, stable emotional energetic state.  I've got a good job I enjoy and a stable living situation and sufficient social interaction.  I have a modicum of happiness and joy.  Getting out of this condition would require effort that I am no longer interested in exerting.  Life is "good enough" to suffice.  Thus, I am in no way motivated to change the situation.  \n\nYes, in superficial ways, I am changing in positive ways; I'm living more healthfully, losing weight and exercising.  I am doing that not to become more attractive, but simply to extend my life and be capable of doing the things I wish to do with it.  I am learning new things, tying new hobbies and extending my massive skill set in new ways that interest me.  I am done chasing "The American Dream" and all the other expectations that society and culture have thrust upon me.  I am unequivocally living for me now.  \n\nI will always be alone because I thrive that way.  I am a better person alone.  This was thrust upon me and damaged me and now I own it.
The "out of my league" thing was my own honest evaluation of the situation.  She is, in my own estimation, strikingly good looking, smart, funny and full of promise.  She is legally deaf and that seems to be the primary problem she has with meeting people and forming relationships.  There are plenty of guys out there that can look beyond that and it is only a matter of her getting out there and being available to meet guys.  She has never claimed to be better than me or beyond my grasp.  She has simply stated that she does not feel any romantic "chemistry" with me and likely never will.  I am not a good fit for her and I agree.   I assert that I am not a good fit for anybody.\n\nI've decided not to send this message to her.  Rather I will let the relationship wither and die of neglect.  If I simply become unavailable to her, she'll grow tired of it and move on.
The Canadians will have the cost of that one covered.  Something to stem the future flow of refugees from their third-world southern neighbor.
During my entire childhood, when I was remarkably tall for my age, my parents instilled a fear in me of being seen as a "big bully".  Even when I was consistently being bullied (for being fat) throughout grade school, I was always warned that despite being right, despite not instigating, and only defending myself, I WOULD most certainly be seen as the aggressor picking on the "little kids" and be punished accordingly.  In most cases the "little kids" were two to three grades older than me!  My brother,who suffered the same treatment, proved their warnings correct when he confronted a kid who threw his gym sneakers in the urinal and proceeded to pee on them.  When my brother attempted to grab the sneakers, the other kid kicked him in the ear enough to cause obvious swelling and bleeding.  Well, in retaliation (and mostly to retrieve his sneakers) he grabbed the kid, lifted him and threw him across the bathroom and against the far wall.  The sneaker-pisser was three years older than my brother but ten inches shorter.  My brother ended up suspended from school for four days over that.  The other kid was only given a berating. \n\nI've always been meek and shy as a result of this mentality; more the peacemaker and the one to seek compromise.  I've certainly suffered from a lack of aggression, competitiveness and self-assuredness as a result of this upbringing.  I'm certain it's had generally detrimental effects on my career and social situation.\n\nAnd, incidentally, I have had experiences with long, painful bouts of sciatica.  That is serious, debilitating pain.  Back pain is horrible.  Your parents are real assholes.  I would wish them cases of degenerative spinal stenosis, but you'd no doubt be the one stuck caring for their wheelchair bound jerk asses because you seem like a good person and don't deserve that.   
If there were an HOA, these two ladies would be President and Vice President, no doubt.
Where is the outrage?  Well, in the Brave New Bizarro-World of Post-Trump Reality, this story is fake news created by the Rothschilds and "Patriotic Proud American's" know to ignore the fake news of the liberal mainstream media.  There are enough myopic Trump supporters to meet the requirement that a lie agreed upon by enough people becomes truth.  The real news is now some random person's old Geocities site and a site that claims no children were ever killed in Sandy Hook, CT.

This guy again?  I'm sure he's posting this thinking he's doing us all some sort of humanitarian service.  I won't bother watching.
My limited experience doesn't bear any of this out.  Granted I've only ever been on three first dates.  On the three separate instances where I did get a woman to go on a date with me it was painfully obvious that I was there to sell myself to her.  These were pity dates.  That was the best I could ever get.  Also, I've never been in the position of having options.  Well, that's not true; I had the option to not bother going on the date.  Getting a first date was a monumental accomplishment not within my control.  If you're getting dates regularly, I imagine you can graduate from beggar to chooser.   \n\nI was perfectly amenable to additional dates, but they felt otherwise.  It's been a decade or longer since I've tried and, honestly, I'm not interested in trying any more.  I'm happier not dealing with this mess.  It only infringes on my economic and time resources while continuously damaging my emotional state.  I have to reason to believe that the benefits of a romantic relationship outweigh the costs.    \n\nStill, even using a sales call or interview as a metaphor for dating is valid.  When you interview for a position or try to sell a product it should be about finding a good fit for both the applicant (salesman) and the potential employer (customer).  \n\nI agree with you that ideally, a date should be a meeting of equals and a learning experience shared by two people.  Job interviews and sales calls should be the same; mutual attempts to foster a relationship as employer and employee or customer and vendor.  Both parties should be on an equal footing, providing mutual satisfaction.  But how often does it work out that way?  My monumental absence of experiential mass, ensures that I am, most certainly, NOT an equal.  I am a 42-year-old virgin.  I have a dearth of experience in dating.   I am a glaring exception to normal human life.  I can draw from no wellspring of past experiences and preferences.  I am the long-term unemployed of dating.  I am the guy who's bills are coming due and needs to sell one more vacuum to make his sales bonus.  There is, inherent in my situation, an implicit desperation that will ALWAYS seep out if I am being honest.  And being dishonest during a date is not in any way fostering a healthy learning experience and, likely, poisoning any future relationship with the sort of toxic breakdown of communication that leads to messy divorces.  Quelling that desperation comes off as stilted, strangeness.  It is off-putting.  I'd prefer saving other people the misfortune of enduring my ineptitude.  It's an insult to others that I would deign to inflict myself on them.  So I don't bother.  We are all happier for me knowing my place and worth.  Come to me to talk about politics, about water quality assessment, firefighting or home renovation or the state of current affairs. I have knowledge and experience to share and have a place and value.  This 'relationships thing" is the one aspect of my life that is abject failure.  I'm done focusing on that failure and I'm moving on to only consider those things that are important to me.
Disrespectful?  No.  Not at all.  Everyone has a breaking point and a whole life full of trauma shaping it.  I'm 42, beyond hope and fully intend to inflect myself upon the world purely out of spite and curiosity.  If I wasn't so lazy, stubborn and weak, I've have checked out ten years ago.  \n\nMy only concern would be the message it sends to young fledgling wizards in the midst of depression.  u/Under_the_bluemoon elaborated on it better. 
I drive school buses and make more per hour than that.  Back when  I was using my Chemistry degree, I was being paid $13.55/hour to run five gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers, review the data and generate final customer reports.  \n

Exactly.  Everyone has that prerogative.  I don't begrudge her for it.  Rather,  I understand my failings and inadequacy and know I must do my part to not inflict myself on her.  
Don't talk about them except to trained, paid professionals who are remunerated for the pain of hearing it. 
I'd probably be just like I am now; fat, too tall, ugly, shy.  The kind of girl desperate enough for love to be consistently used by abusive jerks who know how to prey on the weak.  After a few bad beatings by cheating boyfriends, and pumping out a kid or two, I would have realized I was a lesbian and would have found that they won't date me.  \n\nSo, no, I'm happy being the fat ugly lump of male flesh that I am.  At least nobody wants to use me.
Ella Ella Ella eh eh eh
And the brewery tourists, cider mill tourists, winery tourists, the art gallery viewers, the antique/vintage shoppers, the day hikers, the farmers marketers, the ones looking for that authentic "small town experience", and the aforementioned leaf peepers.  People who treat locals like me as if we are Colonial Williamsburg reenactors "OMG You actually LIVE HERE?".  My personal preference is for the Canadians; so polite and respectful.

Yes. I read on my iPhone 6 with the text zoomed pretty large.  The constant turning of pages was, at first, annoying but I grew accustomed.  I only do it because I scored a disk of the NYT Top 1,000 and NPR's top 100 from a buddy.  I'm set for a few years still.\n
That sounds about right and I'd say 2-4" is a good starting point for heel height.  Avoid anything with platforms or those arched soles.  I think starter heels are better if they have a strap and a heel cup, too.  The first pair of heels I had ever bought was a ridiculous pair of 5-inch stiletto's (I cannot recall the source) and immediately regretted it.  I couldn't wear them long enough to figure out if I could ever get used to heels that high and they also kept destroying my hosiery.  A lot of Pleaser's stuff runs with higher heels (and honestly they're fetish/stripper heels), but I've had a lot of luck with their large selection of tamer stuff.  I've got a pair of "Divine 440's (3-inch heel)" (simple black heel, albeit with a strap) that I can comfortably spend a full day in.  They're comfortable and better quality than one might have suspected given the company's somewhat raunchy market segments.   Given the ogre-like size of my feet, I'm somewhat limited in my selection and buying experiences, so I can't say my evaluation of the quality reflects reality.  It's very cool that you're supportive of this adventure.  I wish there were more people open to defying the gendering of apparel.  \n\nOh, and u/chrkchrkchrk is right on about sizing.  Definitely order from a seller who does free exchanges in case the first pair doesn't fit.   
The Police are here to help.
The hope for love is like a bright, shining flame set upon a high hill overlooking the vast terrifying forest you've been lost in on an unending rainy night.  Your eyes can't help but be drawn to brilliance of hope's light; your body can't help but be drawn to it's luminary promise of warmth.  It fills your vision, consuming your world.  In the pervading darkness, that light is all you can see.  You know it is warm, you know it will sustain you in the the dark wet cold, yet every step you take towards it yields nothing.  Stumbling over unseen obstacles, getting caught up in tree branches, crawling through vines and underbrush, you fight and struggle onward and forward toward the light.  You pay no heed to these unseen things in the way.  They are just shadows in the light of the hope for love.  Still, when you collapse from the effort, and you always do, you've gained nothing.  The flame is always as far away on that hill as it was before you started.  It mocks you.  It is the unattainable goal.\n\nThen the hope dies.\n\nThe light is suddenly quenched.  \n\nYou are left alone in utter darkness.  There is nothing.  You've been gazing at that light of hope for so long, transfixed.  Now you don't know where to turn in the darkness.  You close our eyes to weep for the loss of that light. You shut your eyes in fear of the darkness that shall now consume you entirely.  You'll be lost out here forever.  Expecting only darkness to greet you, you finally do open your eyes again.  You find that you are now surrounded by many smaller flames.  Tiny lanterns.  Torches.  Candles.  Fireflies.  Innumerable small, tenuous flickering things, not anywhere near as bright as that burning hope had been, spread out in the forest, some close, some near, some high, some low.  They are scattered everywhere.  In the moments after the light of hope is gone, you'll look all around for it and realize that you can now see.  In the twilight lit by millions of tiny stars of light, you can see pathways, benches, fountains, and features you had never seen before.  There is a whole world around you of things you had missed.  You see the obstacles are things, pots, fences, planted trellises, hedges, topiaries; a whole world of the things you missed.  You look up to the hill and see, swinging in the cool summer breese, the dark cold form of a gigantic rusty bug zapper.\n\nThe death of hope is, indeed, death.  But there is a life after death.\n\nOr something.  It's actually kind of nice some days.
I look at it as a service to society.  At 40 years old,  I know I'm undesirable and hold no delusions otherwise.  Nothing will change that.  So, I don't burden women with the need to reject me.  I don't bother approaching or making any sort of flirtatious acts toward women.  I interact with everybody on an "as needed" basis.  I'm cordial, friendly, and helpful, but I will not impose myself upon others.  My hope is to be part of the background or at least not a significant concern.  I'm not interested in a relationship any more and prefer not having others hold that expectation that I am.\n\nAs for children?  My gifts to the future are the resources and opportunities my children will not consume.  I'm doing my part to cleanse the world of my poor genetic material.  I'm, happily, a dead end.   \n\n
Yes, for dignity's sake, it's not getting sent.  I've decided to just neglect the friendship to death.  
Steal third, suicide squeeze.  Let's go.

The amount of outraged butthurt from the GOP/Teabagger/Libertarians on this is insane. The comments I've seen; it's like Obama has ordered everybody to ingest a pint of their own feces.  Predictable, but insane.  Again, it's all just an extended metaphor for "HURRRR HE'S STILL BLACK!!!"
That Donald Trump is the rodeo clown to Hillary's presidential bullride.  His antics and outrageous behavior are providing an unelectable honeypot for the GOP.  How better to get a candidate like Hillary, with her trust and likeability issues, into the presidency than to put her up against a buffoon who says every possible wrong thing?  It is like he is saying every outrageous thing he can think up, trying desperately to find the bottom of the septic tank that is the right-wing electorate, thinking that sooner or later the gig will be up and they'll realize he's been gaming them all along.  He cleared out every serious contender in the Republican stable!  I seriously think that Donald will bail out of the election within the next two weeks (citing some bizarre personal issue), leaving the Republican party in utter chaos.  They'll throw up some establishment old-hat (Gingrich or Romney) and the Trumplodytes will scream ESTABLISHMENT TRAITORSOMGARMEDREBELLION!!!  Seriously.  I feel like [this picture](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/30/us/politics/TRUMPBILL/TRUMPBILL-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg) could very well be from the future; a shot during the clandestine private dinner the night after Hillary's inauguration, Bill and Hill, Don and Melania laughing together at their epic troll of the GOP.  If anyone can pull this off, it's Donald Trump.  
Ugh.  I've just gotten back from my fourth Christmas party so far this season.  I have two more to go to.  I'm very involved in the volunteer fire service and end up invited to a half dozen or so of these fire department parties each year.  I'm used to helping coordinate my own agency's party most years and will usually spend most of it in the kitchen preparing food or at the bar serving drinks.  It keeps me social, but also separate from the action and too busy to notice my own discomfort.  At other agencies events, I'll actually volunteer to help out.  I'll run the coat check or I.D. check at the door.  I prefer being embedded in, and busy with, the logistics as much as possible.  It's ironic how I detest these things but manage, by staying busy all night, to be well known and largely appreciated by people.  Everyone says they know me, but nobody really does.  I like it that way.  I forget that I'm the only one who came alone.\n\nThe hard party is my regular job's Christmas Party.  That's a catered affair, so there's no opportunity to keep busy.  I'll usually just show to make an appearance, hang out with the widowers for a bit and then get out.  It helps that most of my coworkers are retirees and much older than me.  There are no single women.        
Wow.  Between that thread and the one referenced within, I'm not entirely sure how a "sick fetishist appropriating perv who mocks women" crossdresser should proceed.  I guess we're the next, remaining allowably repressed minority.
"Got yer nose!!!!" 
Head first, hard... so hard and into what would become an array of spilled dumbbells.
I hear you.  The purple-skinned, horned succubus, tentacle things just turn me off.  It's erotic Pokemon. 
Deepest left shoulder massage ever.
I would say that if you've never dated and now you're into your 30's, it's highly unlikely that you ever will date.  You are missing so much of the experience.  People can sense the ineptitude and abnormality.  Yes, you can "fake it until you make it", but sooner or later, you'll drop the facade, they'll see the insufficient real you, and then dump the real you.  So, the answer is ALL OF IT.  You'll miss out on all of it.  The up side of never dating is that you'll never get dumped. I'd say it's better to never have then to have had and lost.  Kill the hope and learn to live.
Oh no.\n\n"And it seems to me HE lived his life like a candle in the wind..."
:skin crawls:
I agree.
I agree with all of this.  The familiarity takes a lot of the edge off.  You don't need so much of the "game".  You've moved beyond the point where lust and "chemistry" are the critical factors to continued interaction.  That initial, high stakes first impression has been made, and, within the parameters of romantic attachment,  you've failed.  You've become familiar and welcome to some extent.  Unfortunately, it seems, having lust and "chemistry" off the table means they are probably beyond the point of romantic interest in you.  That critical "magic moment" never happened and, likely, won't happen without introducing that "something new / risky".  You may be a treasured friend or a friendly acquaintance; romantic entanglement probably isn't something they are expecting or looking for.  That "something new / risky" in the context of that friendship or acquaintance may be unwelcome if there isn't some underlying reciprocal potential.  \n\nFriendship is the creation of a mutual safe relationship space.  The stressful sales-pitch world of dating is assumed to not be part of that safe place.  It's like waiting patiently for a train on a station platform; you know what direction the train will come from by simply looking down the tracks.  It's arrival will not be a surprise and you probably won't get hit by the train.  Being suddenly run down from behind by a bus that happens to be on the platform and also happens to be going to your intended destination is not an expected or desired outcome.  Yes, they MIGHT be game for taking the bus, but then why would they have walked all the way over to the train station?  Sudden overtures of love from one of your safe friends can be jarring and if there isn't some mutual willingness for that possibility, it can be downright off-putting.  I'm not saying that the Friendzone exists, but everyone establishes friendships with some set of mutual expectations that may put romantic pursuit out of the question.      \n\nThat means that there is a very small sliver of time and possibility for a romantic relationship to come out of a friend or acquaintance.  That period between the cold sell and "too familiar(?)" is tiny.  It is a crapshoot.  It is a rarity when someone hits it.

Bodysuits? Leotards? bodybriefers?  I love'em all!  The thing I'd go for is a bodybriefer, also called an all-in-one shaper.  They are my go-to underwear.  There's no shifting straps, no sudden rolling or "blowouts" of unshaped flab as various sometimes-overlapping waist cinchers, bras and panties slip around.  With a pair of tights or pantyhose, I feel like some sort of crazy superheroine.  I'd avoid the rubbery, unbreatheable ones for underwear or prolonged wearing unless you relish hours soaking in your own brine and smelling like a pickle.\n
That's a really useful question for introspection and personal discovery!  Cool!\n\nOn initial consideration, I wouldn't say I'm selfish, per se.  However, a lifetime without being able to depend on others has made me independent and highly unlikely to seek outside assistance for anything.  It has also taught me that if I don't look out for my own best interests, nobody else will.  That said, I still hold, as a firm fundamental belief, that individuals and society need to assist one another to be healthy and happy.  So, I volunteer in my community on a regular basis, have a job where helping others is a primary mission and chip in, helping people in need where I can be of assistance.  I offer my time, my abilities, skills and shoulder to cry on.\n\nI hedge all of this with the fact that I used to be an inveterate people pleaser.  My desperation for acceptance, friendship, and inclusion had turned me into a gullible doormat and many people saw it and took advantage.  I've been burned hard enough and deep enough to never forget.  So, when I do engage in selfless behavior it does come after a bit of contemplation as to whether I'm being taken advantage of or not.  I also evaluate the potential pros and cons.  This is essentially a check against the lingering desperation to be accepted and wanton self-interest.  I'm usually really good at masking this initial evaluation, but I know some people (especially those who use people) are keen to detect that initial reluctance and use it as a wedge to their advantage.  "Good people don't have to think about it when asked to help a person in need!" AKA the conversational badge of the habitual user of others.  My evaluation tends to fall on the self-preservation end of caution.\n\nSo, I would say I am shrewd with my time and energy.  That does come off as selfish, I guess.  So yes.   I am selfish.  Oh, well.  I will NEVER be used again and find that most people who dislike this attitude were looking to use me from the beginning.
Just got off work.  Showered, laying in bed.  Tomorrow I will spend the day alone winterizing my camper for storage.  I have laundry from last weekend that needs folding, but if I just keep it out It will all soon be dirty again anyway.  I'll eat my leftovers from tonight's dinner.  Sunday I will kayak if it isn't raining.  I'll cook for the next 3-4 days.
Yeah.  Life post-hope is a bag of broken pick axes.  Heavy and pointless.  I've found some solace and guilty entertainment in watching the world burn.  Seeing what will happen next is sort of my life's purpose.  It's passive and I really have no skin in the game.  It's hollow and cruel, but it wiles away the day.
Yup.  Still hot.  But I'm 42 and fat, so YMMV.
Hope is insidious and destructive.  It is the worst form of delusional, wishful thinking.  Hope with determined action can be fine in some contexts, but be prepared for the crush of defeat and then know that that pain was self-inflicted.  As long as you insist on retaining a shred of hope, you will try and you will find failure.  Abandoning hope releases you from the nagging desire try and the inevitability of painful failure.  Without hope, you can simply live and thrive.  When you know with certainty that something is impossible, it no longer holds power over you.    
My heart goes out and into the mouth of a hungry bear.
That's why they visit!  It's just like home but warmer!  VT is their Florida!!!
What you said about feeling as together as the average 16-year-old really resonates with me.  I feel that missing out on all those experiences has left me so out of touch with social norms and behavioral expectations, that the damage is irrecoverable within my lifetime.  It's like deciding to try for a career in ballet at age 60.  There comes a point where dreams have to die.  
And midnight will never be the same.
That's true, I was being a little flippant and harsh on Obama because he bombed 7 fucking countries, but for all of Obama's failings (in my eyes) McCain, Romney, or Hillary wouldn't have even questioned the neocons one single time  and we would have created EVEN MORE senseless death and destruction around the world.
That's fair.  TBH, I'm second guessing doing this entirely.  In looking for any help from that side, it seems obvious it isn't going to come.
McCain doesn't oppose Trump because he is a "good man" he opposes Trump because he is one of the countries top neocon scumbags and Trump hasn't been clear he will bomb everywhere the neocons tell him to like Bush and Obama did.  \n\nPlease do not turn war criminals into saints in your quest to take down the clown.  In the long run you are doing more harm then good.
He got laid down on the butt so, close. 
Was listening to Writers Panel podcast and those two are really old friends apparently.  Jimmi bought a camera with his first movie money that he and Charlie made their first videos with.  So, it's a possibility. 
Not a good day for quarterbacks.

Someone get Yakkety Sax over that last play. 
Anyone but Bill Murray doesn't pull that off. 
Caceras definitely has the best nickname. 
But will it be able to throw a 95kg stone 300m?   Wait I'm mixing memes up with real things sorry. 
Poor Mac. 
The one that came out a few days ago?  I'm assuming yes, since it's Charlie and Glenn but just asking if there is another one too.  I see they have Harmon and Roiland on there too as well as a bunch of others.  Thanks for mentioning this.
The world don't move to the beat of just one drum but it does move to the soothing sounds of Amon Amarth's double bass spitfire.
Oh I love that image.  Anything to piss off these assholes is a good thing today. 
Not to be a dick but it would take you less time to search for them than it would be for me to search and link. 
Cuomo is kind of a douche. 
Someone is running late.  Thanks, Obama. :)
That's pretty hardcore coming from Hardwick.  When he starts calling names, it's serious.
I add to the pile: time to put Romo in. 
He's dead right?  He has to be. 
I had to read this a few times to get it.  Am I just dumb?  Either way, if the Cubs do win, the 3-1 thing from Cleveland fans will be a pretty humorous side note.
I was excited to see another TES but then saw it was online which only then alerted me to that even being a thing.  (I'm kind of new to Skyrim)
Good point it does seem like Fox cancels stuff before it's time. 
Ah shit you are right.  I'm an idiot.  Thanks. 
I was at Game 2.  Same pitching matchup.  I'm not a superstitious person but there is no way in hell I'm selling these tickets and not going.
Edwards had that "yea muthafucka" look walking off the field there. 
Fox just ordered more episodes. 
True.  I'm actually a fan of his and think that there are plenty of negative shows (which many I also like) that it's ok to have a nice guy in the mix.  Can't be pissed off all the time. 
Yea I didn't much care for the song in the article just thought it was Interesting.  Mac Sabbath is decent though. 
I feel better about our chances in this one against Kershaw.  The way the Cubs have been playing the last 2 games it's like they can sense the goal and want to get it done.
Misleading thumbnail. 
That didn't work. 
I was saying during the game last night that the Cubs seemed to get a lot of breaks.  I want them to win but not because of some bullshit.  
I'm trying not to be negative but this is pretty depressing. 
Anyone who said to bench Rizzo is a moron. 
Cubs win and I had a #1 post on r/all today.  What a great night. 
I'm sure you'll still have plenty of time to swing by here and tell everyone why you aren't watching the show.  Can't wait for you and hundreds of others to do that. 
This could still happen in Game 3.  It's his comeback to Wrigley, still pretty rad.
Now we know why they filmed everyone getting killed by Lucille. 
Haven't they all or most of them done AMAs?
I'm pretty stoked CNN is even doing this.  I'll watch Ryan on Thursday too but I probably won't enjoy it. 
The Cubs World Series attendance and losing streak both died in the same year.  That is pretty fucking rad. 
Hopefully tonight's GDT doesn't have the world ending like the last few have.
Up by two now. Looking pretty good.  
Javier Baez will likely have some versatility and I expect him to be an almost every day player this year. 
I will be there Saturday too.  Let's get this tonight so we can be at the clinching game !
Buckle up buckaroo!  -  John Smoltz 
Have you heard of the lord and savior Clayton Kershaw?  Joe Buck has. 
Anyone know who the announcers are on BT Sport 1?
Where is agent Jack Bauer?
Hmmm.  Looks like the connection speed is much lower than it should be. Maybe I just need to restart my router.  If that works I'll feel kinda dumb but oh well. 
Jed Hoyer is a damn sharp dresser. 
And my axe?
Lester knows there is something fucky happening, boys 
Bill Murray is drunk as hell.  
Behind.  Lol.  Perfect for that episode. 
Bernie does not like Cuomo whatsoever.  Pretty funny to watch.  
First season is good but yea, Frank adds a whole other level of depravity. 
Good.
I got through about 15 minutes of it and turned it off. Yea, pretty bad. 
Such a great episode. 
My bad man, my bad. 
I just rented a waverunner for an hour but I'd say that was money well spent. 
That stamp under the Formation section looks like droopy boobies. 
Might be time for Arlovski to call it a career. 
My two year old nephew who plays choo choos all day is more mature. 
This whole sketch was pretty funny and the Cubs were the cherry on top. 
That's it.  Pull Schwarber. Lol jk
I'm not that greedy.  Hopefully the Cubs win this one and then my great night is complete. 
Thanks for the insight. 
Good, they should be considering they were part of the team and all. I doubt any of the other players don't want them there as well.
Who cares, Schwarber is back!
That should have been an inside the park home run. 
If UFC was around in the 50s would we be saying hey check out the tits on Mildred?  And would there be someone that would say dudez, Esther is way fucking hotter. 
Takes one to know one. 
This has to be in my top 5 episodes now.  I've watched it like 6 times. 
The last thing I want is to have to hear the song Cleveland Rocks after today.  Let's go Cubs!
I'm trying to be polite!  Classic. 
Listening to Amon Amarth might have a similar affect. 
Now Cleveland is ficking with the electricity.  
I think that term just might stick. 
I have been saying this too.  The time is right. 
It was the install not the download though.  It was at 95% when I turned it on this morning and played some single player.  It was at 96% an hour ago when I put it in rest mode.  Hopefully it works and I can go and get my ass kicked online. 
Ah cool.  I'll check that out thanks!
They was a face full of dirt there for Kipnis. 
Definitely not decent. \n\nOk that's probably good on the TPB references.  Cleveland is about to get a shit wind coming. 
I used to have that Death poster.  Ah the 90s. 
I thought it was supposed to be about the dicks out for harambe memes. 
The announcers are slightly more bearable when the Cubs are winning.  Weird. 
Norman Reedus might be drunk. 
It's great that they give Len a whole inning on the radio broadcast.  
Wow this is the first time I've ever made the front page.  I'm unreasonably excited about that. 
I will be 41 on Monday so I'd say about 35 years.  Summers for me as a kid were spent watching Bozo in the morning and the Cubs in the afternoon.
If he does run I'll still vote for him so long as he chooses a great VP.
I think this could've been improved by using the footage of Bernie being arrested for protesting for desegregation in Chicago.
Nina!
If he runs I'd vote for him regardless of who he chose as VP.  I'm confident he'll make a wise choice so I can afford to be glib but honestly it could be "Sanders / Intake Manifold 2020" with the slogan, "Make America suck again" and I'm buying the shirt.
Aw, Bernie. I'm just glad I got to witness his campaign, even if he hasn't gotten to be President YET. I wish we all had known him sooner.\n\nedit: more optimistic wording :)
Yep, that'd squeeze it into 59 seconds!
Elizabeth Warren
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Bernie Sanders**   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**------2020------**   \n&nbsp;People: &nbsp;Powered.                 
He's certainly staying in the media spotlight. If he does decide to run, he's not likely to admit for a long time now
I don't know if he'll run in 2020. I feel like we missed out on him already. Maybe he'll find a successor.
Remember all the fan made videos. The together ad still gives me goosebumps 
While I'm not a Christian myself, what about reaching out and using that Jessie Bohon video about Medicare for All? We can reach across "barriers".  Empathy will save us, if anything will.
To be fair, that wasn't "fan made." It was a professional production company. \n\nBut still. Shoutout to JB for the "President we Need" video. That was the first viral grassroots video the campaign saw.
I made this video and I guarantee that there are more coming.
I needed that laugh, thank you!
The air through which the audio is transmitted is public. 
Hopefully, even if Bernie never gets to the WH, his campaigning and rallies sparked a fire under those with similar ideals, and one of them will.
Good question!
Bernie!!!  Bernie!  I miss you.
I think that's an outward image he portrays, and I believe it's true to a large degree as well, but I also find it pragmatic to focus on both -doing what's right in the here and now, but also looking forwards.
It really makes me wonder why he won't just give the media a flat out "no" to all the questions of him running in 2020. They pestered him so much after the election and he repeated how annoying and irrelevant the question was. But he never said no. And since he was so annoyed by the question, then why DIDN'T he just "no!"? Really makes me wonder. Maybe he is leaving the door open. God knows he has the support. God knows he could defeat Trump. 
I would love to see him run in 2020.....but he'll be almost 80.... I don't know if that's a great a idea....
/u/Chartis thanks for posting this. I've got more Bernie videos coming soon.
He's too pragmatic to focus on a presidential run right now 
I agree. No one can replace Bernie. I wish there was someone like him that would be able to stick around politics longer. We will probably never get a non corporatist politician again. 
Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner. 
Music bed is too loud by 20%.\n\nCheering too long by 10%.\n\nWell done!
Better options out there. There needs to be new blood, and if Bernie is going to run, he needs to pass the torch to a new generation, and picking a young, energetic VP would be a great way to do that.
I think so too. He'll assess how he feels in 2019, if the party is more progressive he might not run. But if it's just as establishment, he might run.
2018- elect Berniecrats \n2020- elect Bernie\n2021- bye Trump
Nice work but the message is way too bland," say not to racism" doesnt turn swing voters anymore. I prefer focusing on improving infrastructur , fighting the shadow government plutocrazy and getting corporations to finally pay their taxes. These is the kind of  message that differentiates bernie from all other democrats
The issue is Bernie has a long history of studying political theory. He's a socialist. He believes a lot of the things he does because of years of trying to negotiate democratic socialism with the established system. \n\nBack in his day, there was a much larger labor and socialist movement. That was systematically destroyed by the cold war and he's had the misfortune of seeing any leftism disappear in the country and replaced in vernacular with liberalism and in practice by a basic capitalist propaganda de-education campaign. \n\nThere's not really anyone else like Bernie, by design. Everyone else is either woefully inexperienced, not nearly as charismatic, or a capitalist. \n\nThere's a reason he's so pure compared to other really good progressives like Warren and Franken. They don't actually want to change the system.\n\nIt has to be Bernie and there has to be a revolution in education of leftism. Jacobin and Verso are helping that along but Bernie has catalyzed their recent growth. What happens after Bernie? 
Glad to help.  I'd also consider, "Sanders / Stain" with the slogan, "America's Got Wood!"
Fuck deregulation and those that love it.
Yup.  $3,500 per household.\n\nBuy one here:  https://www.tesla.com/powerwall

Nobody say it...
I think the first rope went over the top
No, she was very obviously not into him. He blatantly offended her a couple times and she looked visibly turned off, yet she still kept him around. He was the most prime example of a producer pick that this show has ever seen. 
I wanna know if anyone's hit that. She seems like a pretty immature little tease....I wouldn't be surprised if she's a virgin. 
Let's see a cut. There are enough pro editors here that could probably tell you what to cut.  I could probably even do it myself (though alternate footage might be required for the best result).
They're basically identical.
I'm pretty sure a real Westworld would cost a lot more than this...
I don't think that beats the firing and suicide of Lane Pryce. 
I agree that the type of suit and tie he wears is kind of just an old man "i've always done it this way" sort of thing.  But there is definitely something psychological going on with his hair.  
I'm pretty sure Bobby never amounts to anything in the show because he's just too young. It's hard to have any kind of meaningful character development with such a young actor. It's very rare to get a kid like Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, for example (and he was probably even older in that). Sally was probably the age Bobby was at the end of the series in season 1. 
Really nice work.
Her ass ain't fake. 
lol nice try being condescending. And I don't jerk off to this shit....I think you might have just revealed who is actually pathetic. 
It's always the people who tattoo stupid shit on themselves who are saying "who cares what it looks like when you're 60?"

Yeah you should really never give yourself more than 3 credits unless it's a big budget film and you actually did do more than 3 roles (because that is impressive - like James Cameron writing, directing, editing, & producing). \n\nThe only credits you should be giving yourself when you did everything on a low budget/student film is director, writer, editor, cinematographer, and maybe producer. Pick three. I probably would't even put DP if it's a low budget thing that you obviously shot yourself. "Written and directed by" or "a film by" says a lot. Nothing screams student film like "directed by" + "sound supervisor". 
This is standard adolescence.

It's usually if there's too much story to fit into one film. It's pretty simple; If the characters, the world of the story, and the things you're trying to say have enough to be expanded into several hours, then you probably wanna make it a series.
You said it yourself, Playboy has articles. So that makes sense. There's no plot on a talk show. \n\nI'm not making a fool of myself, and I give zero fucks if I am anyway.  Keep the downvotes coming. This isn't up for debate. It's literally wrong to use this phrase on a show that doesn't have a plot. It's meant for movies or tv shows. Period. It's in the sub rules as well. 
Two birds with one stone 
So was Sabina Gadecki in the Entourage movie....they always made the guys on the show date the hottest girls. 
I dunno. She's young and religious. I also find that girls that are this hot aren't usually easy. 
A lot of top tier actors could.  Everyone always says "No one else could play X" about their favourite shows but that's just because they're so used to that person.  A lot of great actors could pull off any famous characters. Walter White or Don Draper could have easily been some other good actor. It would be different....but could still be good in its own way.
Either way, it was clear they didn't have a good enough actor for Bobby to write a more interesting storyline for him, considering they kept changing him. I think the actor who played him at the end could have handled a bit more complicated storyline, and they did give him a few little moments (like when he trades Betty's sandwich away on their school field trip), but it was a little late to dig into him I think. I actually think the actress that played Sally was a bit stiff sometimes, too, but she got the job done. 
I saw a short film online the other day that looked like this and I just thought the uploader warp stabilized their whole film...now I know it was the YouTube stabilizer. \n\n
I'm pretty sure the zoom and refocus were done artificially to help "sell" the effect. It appears to have worked.  That, or the cards were artificially blurred at that right time to match the focus buzz in the real shot.
I don't think you will be exhausted. You will just have a new outlook and "feeling". And depending on what type of experience you have, it should be fine to travel (unless you have a really hard experience that makes you wanna go home and lay low or get your shit together).  
It's true. Most people who suffer from depression and anxiety spend most of their time sitting on their ass, isolated in their home. They think that their condition makes them do this, but it's actually *why* they're depressed/anxious. \n\nsource: I used to be one of these people. (And still am sometimes if I don't work at it)
It depends on the person....a lot of people become depressed as a result of extended periods of no exercise, no meaningful social interactions, prolonged isolation, constant stress, or a combination of those things....and then yes, the depression leads to more of that behaviour which is what makes it so difficult to deal with. These things can happen gradually over time without you even realizing it, and before you know it, your brain chemistry is really weak and you're now depressed.  \n\nThe causes of depression are obviously complicated and not fully known, but the things I've listed definitely are known to contribute.\n\nI just think people need to stop thinking it's some disease they've been unlucky enough to have been struck with, and consider their lifestyle habits or circumstances in their life as contributors. \n\nAside from exercise, eating, sleeping etc. 'depressing' things in someone's life can contribute as well, such as losing a job or a loved one, or getting dumped, or being under a ton of stress financially or otherwise. But I don't think 'clinical depression' is necessarily a direct result of these circumstances, as much as it is a result of the physiological side effects that occur because of them. For example, if you lose your job and can't pay the bills...that sucks and will make you unhappy, but that isn't what makes you clinically depressed....it's the *stress* that causes negative effects on your brain which leads to 'clinical depression,' and not just unhappiness.\n\nWhen someone says, "The only thing that works for me is medication,"  I just cant help but think they haven't considered all the angles.  You can't carry on doing whatever you're doing and keep taking medication if you wanna get better. The medication is just a band-aid going over a wound that will never heal. It's like filling a bucket with water when it has a hole in the bottom. The medication will keep topping it up, but it will never solve the problem.  It's kind of a cop-out to take medication in my opinion. And this is coming from someone who did take medication and has been through all of it.  \n\nThere's a lot more to it than is commonly understood and talked about. Most family doctors don't even know anything about this stuff so they're happy to just prescribe medication since it's what everyone does. It's certainly a lot easier than digging deeper to find out what's really at the root of the problem.
Anything more than 3 could be a bit intense to handle, in my opinion. It's an extremely powerful psychedelic experience that can really blow your mind....depending on the type of experiences you have, you might want more, or you might want less. When I was at a retreat, 2 or 3 people didnt even participate in the 2nd or 3rd ceremonies, it was too much for them to handle. Other people had wonderful experiences and didnt break through until the 4th or 5th ceremony. It's hard to tell until you do it and see how you feel....but 3 or 4 is a pretty good number I think.  The first or second are usually really tough and more about getting familiar with it and comfortable with the experience, so you may not start really getting anywhere until the 3rd....but again, it's different for everyone, some people have amazing experiences on the first one.  I don't think that's common though.
There are hundreds of outtakes....they'll never be released though.
I don't actually care "so much" but when a bunch of people argue with me I'm gonna reply
Except if you were a finalist or a winner in the Doritos contest you got a shitload of exposure and many of those filmmakers went on to get commercial representation afterwards. 
Do you realize how bad it would be for the show if someone died?  If they are aware of a potential problem, they're gonna nip it in the bud. Otherwise, predators are the only thing they can't control and it wouldn't look as bad if that happened. But if they checked someone's health and saw that it was poor, and let them continue, and they went on to die, that would be a PR disaster. 
Save some of that breathable air for us too!  Maybe you can send it as foreign aid?  Canada saves the world.
It's not "plot" when it's a live TV show. \n\nDownvote me all you want, this isn't a movie or a TV show with a plot. These types of posts don't belong in this sub.
He's not comfortable in his own skin though, that's my whole point. He cares more what other people think than anyone!  Why do you think he gets in petty twitter battles and resorts to name-calling and other childish bullshit?  He's insecure as fuck.  Someone who was comfortable in their own skin would be confident enough to try out a new, more flattering hair-style, without fear of the criticism and judgement that would come along with it.
I have a couple of friends who I think I've done this exact same thing with. We smoke weed and dive into the same topics over and over again, and we can never remember if we've had that convo together or not.
This is definitely the case. There was no "CGI" done on her ass for a music video.  It's pretty easy to fall out of shape in a matter of months. This video was almost 3 years ago.
I agree...I have nothing against him really. He's achieved an impressive level of success...but I'm still baffled by how it's happened. He has 50 million + subscribers and every video is just a bunch of screaming and juvenile shit.  Like I'm usually pretty open to different things (h3h3 is pretty absurd and 'out there' a lot of the time), but I just can't see what's appealing or funny about PewDiePie's videos. I literally can't get through more than 30 seconds of one of his videos without being like "wtf is this? it's not even funny."  I think the answer is what Ethan and Hila said about a lot of those dumb prank videos that get so many views: *"It's kids."*\n\n
The translation on this video is kind of bad...
She has "Jeremiah 29:11 †" in her instagram profile.  I just get the vibe from her that she's the type of girl that likes the attention and likes to flaunt it, but never actually gives it up. She seems kind of immature.
Dont' forget [Sommer Ray](http://instagram.com/sommerray).
You're just not taking enough, man. 
No shit. But the "plot" is normally used as code word for boob in a movie that ACTUALLY HAS A PLOT. It's like "oh this movie has a really great plot" when the girl takes her top off. That's the fucking joke. If you say "this show has a really great plot" when it's a fucking talk show, it makes no sense. \n\nIn that instance, the codeword would need to be something like, "I really love the conversations on these Spanish talk shows". Do you idiots even get the joke in this subreddit's name?  There should be a sub called "WatchItForTheConversations" with talkshow nip slips or something. Do you fucking get it now?
If you have mild depression that isn't a serious chemical imbalance requiring medication, then the lifestyle changes can definitely make a difference. I'd recommend reading the book written by that doctor who did the TED talk.
This is why tax breaks and things like carbon taxes are so important. They make it more profitable to be environmentally friendly. It's really the only way to combat the capitalist destruction of the planet.  We'll never stop the capitalism, so just play the game in a way that helps the cause. 
Bannon really is a ghastly-looking motherfucker. 
This is like something you'd see in high school when kids are forced to do a shitty video project and none of them know how to act.
Damn that was BAD
Yeah it's actually kind of foolish to use this speech to sell cars. The irony is palpable. \n\nHe's talking about how people seek things in the future to find fulfillment, instead of embracing the present moment and living fulling now. And the idea that buying a car will do something for you is kind of the opposite of that.
What are you looking for? A big cloud producer with mods etc. or a more simple pen style vape?
A predictable response from a redneck Trump supporter. 
Tell me this isn't real.
We just need to be conscious of the things our body needs naturally. Our body is not meant to sit in front of a computer all day, or isolated in one's house, not interacting with others or not participating in a community, or not getting enough sleep or sunlight, or eating processed/fast food. If you are aware of the things that we are biologically programmed to do, you can try to do them yourself and your body will reward you for it.
Yeah often you can just cut right into a scene with an insert, like a beer glass coming down on the counter, then you cut wider to show the guy sitting at the bar. You can cut like 10-15 seconds of entering the bar etc.   \n\nMore inexperienced filmmakers usually show characters turning the door knob, closing the door, walking to their car, opening the car, starting the car, driving away etc.  When you can just cut to: key in the ignition -> drive away.  \n\nI'm betting OP's film has stuff like this that could be cut out, or every single shot could probably be tightened, or there are alternate ways of conveying whatever story things he deems important.
Trevone Martin.  A guy felt threatened because a black man was walking around in an upper class neighborhood.  Followed him and shot him.  Stand your ground was the defense.  He didn't get charged with murder.  
Is living forever happy? I actually find the thought kind of terrifying. Part of what makes life meaningful and special is that it is finite. If it were to go on eternally it would change your attitude about everything, wouldn't it?  Right now we live with a certain kind of urgency or preciousness with everything we do because we know that our time is limited. \n\nObviously I don't wanna die, but living for all eternity is almost worse. There's no reprieve. It's actually hell in my opinion. It's hard for us to even grasp the concept of eternity but it's kind of terrifying if you can think about it. \n\nHas anyone seen The Fountain with Hugh Jackman? His character is obsessed with conquering death and one part of the story (I think it's metaphorical, but that's a whole other discussion) floats through space in a bubble by himself forever, and it's scary. 
Pretty sure this is a wedding...
No Country for Old Men
Trump has all of his hair. He just chooses to stick with some weird hair style that he does himself (for reasons I've already speculated). There was an article somewhere about his hair stylist on The Apprentice who said he was very particular about his hair and he would show up to the filming with it already done; and it appeared as though it was cut and dyed by someone in his inner circle, possibly his wife or daughter. The haircut was terrible and just cut in straight lines, and the dye job was only on the top and didn't cover the roots. And it was all held together with hair spray in a thick matte. There's definitely some weird psychological/control issues going on behind that horrendous hair-do. 
It would just give him a reason to bash her more though. It would definitely be annoying for him but he would just brush it off by saying how bad her impersonation was and how unfunny she is etc. \n\n
The problem with warmer, more abundant environments is that it could just go on forever. It's a fine balance between habitable/challenging. 
Yeah if anything that means he didn't win, because they wouldn't show a shot of something that they only show for the winner.
[NSFW](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph579385dbd93c5)
I think there's a good chance of prequels/spin offs though.
When someone is saying something that is scientifically proven is wrong, I'm gonna go ahead and assume something is wrong with their anecdotal evidence. Going to the gym a couple times and doing a half ass workout isn't gonna solve your problems. 
It really sucks he's not around for some of the stuff that's going on nowadays, like VR, Donald Trump, marijuana legalization, and psychedelics being accepted in medicine (eventually).
I say just act like it never happened, then do the thing you originally meant to do. Share the same "memory" but say what you wanted to say originally, "I miss *them* so much."  But don't even mention the original mistake or that you're correcting it. It will *look* like a correction to anyone that did notice the original post, without having to draw attention to the fuck-up. \n\nIf you wanna go a step further to hint that the original post was a fuck-up, you could even italicize "them" or * star * it or something to help convey that the post is actually a correction to the previous one. 
The photoshop is strong with this one.
I think what people don't get about Trump's (bad) fashion choices is that it's very psychological. He's got all kinds of crazy ego issues that run really deep and have gone on for so long. He *can't* change his look. That would be admitting that he's flawed or isn't "the best". Even after being ridiculed for years about his hair, he can't change it. It would make him appear weak.  He's so severely fucked up psychologically, his fashion failures are just one symptom. 
Sorry but this isn't something to agree or disagree with.  It's measurable science. It's literally how the brain works. Exercise does so much for strengthening your brain chemistry. If you thought it made it worse for you, that's a psychological effect and you probably weren't doing it right, or enough.  Check out the book savemejubus0 posted, or another one called ["The Depression Cure"](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0097DHV94/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) if you want to know more about how exercise affects the brain positively.  If you raise your heart-rate for 30 mins (to the point of being out of breath), 3 times a week, you will notice an improvement in your mental health.\n\nI'm being downvoted because most people who suffer from depression and anxiety don't like to accept any responsibility for their condition and like to think it's just some 'disease' they're unlucky enough to have been stricken with, and the only solution is to take some medication to solve the problem. While some people *are* more susceptible to it, it can be mitigated and controlled with the right lifestyle habits; most importantly, exercise. And this isn't a psychological effect, like "wow I feel great because I got off my ass and went to the gym today, and i'm improving myself"....there are actual physiological effects going on when your heart rate goes up and you break a sweat.\n\nEveryone always gets defensive about their method of healing, but if you can let go of that for a second and open your mind to the possibility that perhaps your lifestyle habits are part of the problem, you can do a lot of healing from improving your habits, mainly reducing stress and exercising frequently. [The Depression Cure](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0097DHV94/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) has a lot of insightful information about bad habits people have that cause inflammation and other negative effects in the brain that lead to depression and anxiety. There are well-documented studies that verify these claims....but you often won't hear much about them because there's *a lot* of money being made by pharmaceutical companies, and it's a lot easier for doctors to prescribe medication.
Permanently inking memey stuff on your body is a terrible idea. Imagine what was funny or popular on the internet in 2012. Do you want that on your body in 2017? What about 2035? These things change and get old so fast.  H3H3 is very likely not gonna be  meaningful to you when you're 50+
That's why Donald Trump is so scary. He is exactly like this. He doesn't give a *fuck* about helping American people. He just wants to be as important as possible, and make the country great so that *he* looks great for being responsible.
First of all, "scripted" and "plot" are not the same thing. Secondly, these shows aren't "scripted" and don't have a "narrative" in the same way that a fiction show with a plot does. People that don't know anything about the TV business love to say everything's scripted, but isn't. Most talk shows/variety shows are heavily structured and planned, but no one's reading from a script (unless you're referring to a talk show monologue or a 'bit').  Regardless, that isn't plot. Plot is a storyline created by a writer in a fictional story.  You're clearly one of the morons that doesn't see a problem with this because they don't know what "plot" is referring to in the first place.
I never said this applies to everyone.  Trump quite clearly has some very intense issues with narcissism and self-worth, and a lot of it can be traced back to his formative years when he was seeking his father's approval (which was almost impossible).  His desire to be the president has *nothing* to do with serving the people or "making america great again."  It has everything to do with filling a hole that can never be filled. Everything he does has to be the biggest and the best. What position in life can be any higher than the presidency? It's the biggest prize.  His ego will never be satiated. He will be feeding it for the rest of his life.  And all of these issues factor into things like fashion and interior design. How does it look if he changes his hair style after everyone ridicules him for it?  It threatens his image as the best. He can't be the all-knowing Top Dog if he's giving in to criticism from all these losers. He's the best. He can leave it the way it is because it's how he's always done it, and he's always been the best, so there's no need to change it. \n\nIf he was a humble, down to earth person, he'd be accepting of advice or suggestions from other people. But he's the biggest narcissist on the planet so he can't.  Which is what's so terrifying about him being the president now.  It's seriously so fucked up, and I think we're gonna see some really bad shit in the next 4 years.  Ego is one of the great enemies of humanity, and Trump has the biggest ego of all.
It's understandable. I wouldn't pull out either. 
You nailed it. Our ancestors (who we are not very different from biologically), lived much different lifestyles than us. Our bodies are not designed to put up with a lot of the stress and weird bullshit modern-day people deal with. We are wired to do certain things, like be active, interact with other people, get sunlight, eat nutritious fresh food etc. and then be rewarded for it biologically. \n\n[This TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drv3BP0Fdi8) talks all about how depression is a disease of civilization and I agree with it completely. I don't even know how you could disagree with it considering the amount of people that are depressed these days has reach epidemic numbers, and cultures that still live hunter gatherer lifestyles nowadays have no instances of depression.
I'm just sick of seeing posts from talk shows and variety shows referring to "plot". These shows don't have plots. Everyone will upvote any nudity but it's literally not right for this sub and I don't give a shit about pointing it out and getting downvoted for it. 
You think that decision is up to him? The producers *require* people like Corinne up to a certain point just to keep the show interesting until things get more serious with the good girls.  Why do you think Chad lasted so long last year? He made a complete ass of himself like two episodes in and JoJo was mysteriously still seeing something in him...
The market was cool. Its not a bad idea to get a local person to take you through Belen Market. I went alone the first time and definitely felt a bit uncomfortable and I stood out like a sore thumb. I've heard it can be unsafe for foreigners in certain areas but I'm not totally sure about that. I met one of those street hustler guys who sells bracelets and paid him like 15 soles to drive me there another time and show me around, and it was worth it. I would also recommend taking a boat trip. There's one that goes to some butterfly/animal sanctuary that was really cool. 
Do you know what the word "plot" is referring to?  It's a written storyline. This sub is meant for clips from those movies or TV shows that you watch because of the nudity and not the storyline. A live TV show doesn't have a plot. It's not a written story. A clip like this would belong in a sub called "WatchItForTheTalking" or something relevant to a talk show. This post is more appropriate in /r/nsfw_gifs
My point is it *doesn't* work just as well with variety shows. The joke is completely lost because a variety show doesn't have a plot. Unless you think it's funny *because* it doesn't have a plot. I just dont' think that's funny. \n\nOr like I said before, that's when something like "I love the topics of conversation on these shows" is more appropriate if you're watching a talk show that's shallow/sexy. "Plot" is just not right in this context.
You do not want that thing coming after you.
I think his office might have been on a different floor or something wasn't it ?
I get "the ongoing joke of the forum".  But i don't think you understand why it doesn't work for talk shows. It's like saying "I like to read Playboy for the plot". Playboy isn't fictional literature! It works to say you read it for the articles. That's why it's funny. It's the same way with movies. It's funny to use plot as a code word because there *is* a plot. \n\nIt *is* a simple concept and I don't know why I have to even explain this. 
It's all about ego, which is what was so cool about the scene with the Buddhist monks and the sand mandala at the end of Season 3. It was a perfect counterpoint for the ego-driven mindset that the Underwoods have, and you could see Claire contemplating this. Buddhism is all about detaching from the ego and not letting it control your happiness.\n\n The monks work intensely in *the present moment*. They meditate on each little speck of sand they place down, and that's all they care about...the present moment experience. (this is one of the central ideas in Buddhism and many other spiritual practices). They don't think about how long they've been doing it, or worry about it being over, or think about what's going to come of the finished work. They only focus on the experience of doing it. One moment after another. It's like the old saying "it's about the journey, not the destination". And that's why they ceremoniously erase all their work once it's finished, the same way our lives are wiped away when we die. Because the finished work doesn't matter. The same way what we do in our lives doesn't when we come to the end. It only matters in the moment we are doing it. That's all life really is. And when people get caught up in creating some kind of legacy, or amounting to something, they miss the entire point of enjoying life while it lasts, and ultimately end up unhappy because they are chasing something that will never arrive. When you die, you won't be around to enjoy your legacy. It shouldn't be the focus of your attention.\n\nIn their arguments toward the end of season 3, particularly toward the end of the finale episode, it was very clear that Frank doesn't get this idea. He says "When we lose because of you, there will be nothing. No plan. No future. We will only be has-beens. And you wanna amount to something?" He is so hell-bent on being something important. Being remembered. Leaving a lasting legacy. So much so that he ruins every relationship and throws everyone else under the bus.\n\nHe's fighting so hard to hold up his dream of being remembered, and being a significant President that he's missing out on what really matters. If he could just let it go of all that, he could be happy, and his relationships would be healthy.\n\nRemy Danton's storyline is the alternative to Frank's. Remy let go. He realized that fighting so hard to be something, just for the sake of feeding your ego with ideas of prestige and legacy isn't worth the stress, back-stabbing, and bullshit. When Jackie Sharp asks him what he's gonna do after quitting politics he says, "That's the best part, I have no idea."\n\nHaving let go of this ego-fuelled pursuit of happiness (that is never-ending), he's finally found happiness and freedom in the present moment. He can do anything. His happiness is no longer going to be achieved by reaching some form of success in the future (which will never come, because as soon as one level of success is reached, another will have to be pursued). And it seems Jackie Sharp was starting to realize this as well...even Claire was 'letting go' and realizing it's not worth the bullshit. I believe that's what was going through her head when she was looking at the sand mandala photo at the end of the finale. Frank had just told her "you will be nothing", and it looked like she was starting to realize that being 'nothing' is better than ruining everything in your life trying so desperately to be something.\n\nDonald Trump is the perfect example of this ego-driven mentality. When you realize this, you actually begin to feel sorry for him.  He's so incredibly unenlightened and unhappy. He will never be truly happy or at peace because he's constantly feeding his ego for fulfillment (Frank Underwood is the same). He's a narcissistic business man who had to literally run for the highest position in America to seek fulfillment. He certainly doesn't care about helping people, so it's the only explanation for his ambitions. It's fucking sad if you think about it.\n\n 
The worst part isn't going to the gym. It's the dieting. Eating the right foods, in the right amounts, at the right times, and not eating certain foods. Then  add in supplements. Learning about all that shit is a huge part of it. Working out is 50%, maybe less. 
Thank you.
Truth!
I used to be one of those people who cared about little continuity things when I was younger, but after directing and editing a ton of stuff I've learned that it doesn't matter.\n\nFilmmaking is just an illusion. It's a magic trick. A lot of the early filmmakers *were* magicians. And in a magic trick, the goal is to just fool the audience, by whatever means necessary. If you were to film a magician doing a trick, and then slowed it down and observed it from every angle you would see what they did. But that's not how audiences view the trick. They view it in real-time, with mis-direction and sleight of hand etc.  A movie is no different.  There are all kinds of "cheats" and mis-directs going on in filmmaking as well, and if the audience makes it through the scene without noticing any of them, then it doesn't matter.  Of course, if a continuity error is blatant to the point of distracting from what's important, then I think it is an issue, but those sorts of things don't make it into movies very often.\n\nI was editing a commercial about a year ago and the agency's creative director was super nit-picky about every little detail (I made the mistake of painting out a few minor things, which opened the floodgates for fixing *everything* once she knew that was a possibility)....and there was one shot at the beginning of the spot where a woman was spraying her car with a hose, and then we cut to a couple of close ups and inserts, and then back to the same wide angle, and the position of the hose coiled up on the lawn had been moved on this different take....and we got into a big debate about the continuity being an issue (I was mainly fighting it because there was only one VFX artist available to fix that sort of thing and he was already overworked with the real VFX shots).....She wanted it to be perfect just for the sake of being perfect. It would be literally impossible for anyone to notice the hose had moved without pausing the video and comparing the two shots, since they don't cut together.  That's a prime example of bullshit continuity nit-picking that pisses me off.  Again, if you look at it like a magic trick, the audience would never notice the trickery, so it doesn't matter.  Now I sometimes intentionally don't mention things like that when I notice them because I know they'll just wanna fix them for the sake of making it perfect...but like the audience, they will never notice it unless it's slowed down and pointed out to them.
She's kind of annoying but her ass is fuckin crazy.
But if you're in love with someone, you're not gonna leave them because you can't see your kid for a month. It's not like you're choosing one over the other. It's just temporary. It may be hard but it's not a very good reason to leave a potential life partner. My point is, the fact that he used that excuse, showed that he wasn't that into her. It was a way to avoid telling her he's not into her....and Ashley was too oblivious to pick up on that.
This stuff is cool and all, but it's best if these get posted in https://www.reddit.com/r/Moviesinthemaking/  
I like seeing celebrity nude scenes in movies or whatever....doesn't mean I jerk off to it. It's just eye candy to click through occasionally on reddit.
Yeah I heard that no one is actually allowed to sing live at the Super Bowl because they need to make sure no one says anything inappropriate or whatever. So they record a live rehearsal run through, and they lip sync to that....so it still sounds live.
Nice! As fun as a big wedding is, it's a fucking terrible idea for people who don't have the extra money to blow on it. I always cringe at the thought of people going into debt or blowing their savings on a wedding.  I've always liked the idea of just eloping and then having some kind of party afterwards with the friends and family you would have invited to the wedding.
Hmmm...must be the uniform.  
I am a mom who has a host of medical issues.  My daughter is a beautiful, responsible 12 year old.  I started saving for her when I started getting sick and have life insurance.  I have a mentor that has agreed to fill the mom duties if necessary.  I wonder if there is anything else I can do to make her path easier.  My hubby will put her in counseling and our family doctor will keep an eye out for depression, etc.  I feel like I've planned what I can.  I am going to write her letters for each life event I may miss out on.

Nice!  Hopefully they will understand our frustration comes from lack of representation.  
I agree.  I'm disappointed in our politicians too.  We shouldn't have to remind them of our desire to keep our national parks intact and our public schools functioning.  
Yes.  It is.  If you've had any customer facing job you know it is part of it.  We pay taxes, we vote and are allowed to become upset when public lands are being sold without our permission.
I wish individuals that are prolife would be prolife.  Mandating WIC be fully funded, preK and daycare assistance programs, additional SNAP funds and free lawyers if needed for custody issues.  Additional housing.  Give these children a childhood if you are going to force a mother to have a child.  I'm ok with that and the programs should transfer if the child is adopted.  
Thank you!  
My favorite quote is from my 11 year old son, "It's treason".  Not my king, we have rights too.  Peaceful protest is necessary.
I am making a general comment about the state of political unrest.  Democrats failed us with Clinton.  I don't see a way forward with the politicians and their love affair with money.  I hope we have an influx of new people.  I am progressive and want more military vets going into Congress.  Just my opinion.  I eat meat and my hubby hunts.  I want fiscal responsibility and moral integrity.  I don't view SS as a problem instead Congress needs to stop using it as a piggy bank.  Snowden just disclosed what our government was doing in secret.  To my knowledge no one has died as a result of his actions.  If we punish people for telling the truth we will end up with a government that doesn't operate with checks and balances.  
Thanks for the information!
Jason Chaffetz was REAMED at his townhall tonight as a result of failure to investigate.  We are  not happy.
Are you familiar with the issues our veteran populations are facing?  Many have short term or long term memory issues and are 8 times to get cancer.  Of our 1st Gulf War veterans 90% are currently permanently disabled.  Back and knee issues are commonplace.  I am bringing these issues up because it seems as if you don't see value in your employees and our vets don't deserve a boss like you.  
Most of the reason I am not impressed with Chippy is what has been decided with regards to public lands.  It was randomly decided and it feels as if our representatives don't care if we disagree.  
Life is a terminable disease.  You need to let it go.  Worrying is just punishing yourself twice.  Air pollution is more likely to kill him.
I'm sorry if you find my desire to perform my civic duty to benefit our country disappointing.  I am an independent.  Both parties are unfortunately operating without listening to their constituents.  
We find people with integrity to run in 2018 as an independent.

Social Security is in a different account.  The fact Congress pretends Medicare and Social Security should be considered "available funds" is an issue.  It's forced retirement savings and truly an earned benefit.  
Want???  We need it.  We end up having the worse air in the country for months.  We live on a fault line and don't want earthquakes because a big one sets off a supervolcano in Yellowstone.  We want to survive and not have kids ending up in the ER with asthma attacks, pnuemonia, and other pulmonary problems.  
Thanks!
As someone that hot sick at 26 and had all the correct long term/short term insuance and have a spouse with excellent health insurance you have no idea the massive amount of guilt I feel seeing others in my same situation unable to afford medication.  I feel like despite the fact I wake up and am assaulted by pain and exhaustion all day I am SO LUCKY.  No one should face a total health betrayal in addition to feeling as if the only way to keep your family housed and fed is giving in and killing yourself.  
He already had his mind made up.  He won't vote no to DeVos or answer our questions.  He ended saying he was returning power to the people.  Annoyed beyond belief.  He doesn't care what we think.  
So bad.  Go solar before they tax away the rebates.  I did today.  Same cost.
I'm grateful that you are participating in the democratic process.  
Unfortunately it's not just liberals that are upset.  As a mother I am greatly concerned.
Can we keep this civil?  
550,000 veterans are dealing with TBI's and PTSD.  We've dropped millions of bombs.  We need to use diplomacy, peaceful methods and food instead of bombs.  
What are your favorite qualities in patients?
My daughter works hard and saves $5-38 at a time.  She's 18 but I am proud that we managed to inflict the saving ideology on her.  My son is 11 and has saved over $300 in allowance.  I hope we can continue to impress upon them the necessity of preparation.  
I have MS but it isn't as aggressive as it used to be.  I try to be a good patient but even though it sucks it's given me better relationships.  Thanks for the insight.  You have no idea how much you are appreciated.  We really don't get leave the house often and we consider you kinda our only friends if we are going through a rough patch.  =)  Thank you for bearing witness to our existence and thinking of us now and again. 
If you had a flu outbreak and 22 people called in sick would you can them for harming your business?  Will your business suffer if there is a backlash?  
The DNC choosing their favorite  2 years before people voted isn't enticing.  I'm independent and horrified by both parties.
No.  You can't conceal carry a gun if you are not responsible enough to drink.  
Changes to education are still in progress.  DeVos implemented the voucher program with stunning failure in her own state.  I don't understand why such an epic failure would be contemplated nationwide.  Unless it's just another wealth building exercise.  
Maybe but I don't like the glorification of stupid people.  No Wallmart doesn't make walls but you've inspired a generation to make equally idiotic statements.  (The fact I know that means she made millions, money is not the equivalent of value to society)
You are a good man.  The fact that we feel safe is because you are here.  You may not be all powerful but you take the hit with us and we love you for it.  You are our protectors.
Lol.  If you weren't there or don't want to be included that's ok too.
Utahns created an invoice for him and are mailing them to Chaffetz.  Apparently he knows who will pay people for showing up.  Hopefully he'll forward the invoices to the appropriate party.  #unpaidutahn may start trending.
I am not taking it personally.  I have teenagers.  ;)
Rich people have networks that poor people do not have therefore more access to opportunity.  How else can you explain DeVos?  Unqualified rich chick who wanted to buy a job\n
Absolutely.  Give me a bit.
I LIKE HIM.  ALOT.
Dude, I need an industrial box.  
Trump has eluded to torture being okay.  I've seen pics of the detention centers setup for the illegal immigrants from Mexico and I'm worried.  I do think the protests are potentially helping us avoid camps being set up.
Will Democrats get rid of superdelegates so we can?
Why some women feel compelled to get an abortion.  I was someone that picketed.  Then I got pregnant and realized that the father's family accepted that grandpa was a sexual predator.  I couldn't afford a child or a lawyer and his family had the ability to force shared custody.  In the midst of a recession I couldn't find any other alternative than setting my child up for sexual exploitation.  I struggled for years with having an abortion four weeks in but I couldn't do it.  Bring a child into the world to suffer, financially dependent on a child predator.
Credit Union have better reputations.  I've never heard of a credit union creating fake accounts and charging their customers fees.  (Wells Fargo)
Seriously agree.  We don't need machine guns but is that the MOST IMPORTANT issue we are facing?  POVERTY is what we need to declare war on not people.  
Primary issue is battery life.  I am waiting to purchase the Tesla Model 3.  We put in solar panels yesterday so we are closer than we were.
Do you have an orange cheetoh mascot?  Your PM makes panties drop, our guy makes us shrivel up into crazy feminazis.  No one in America is getting anything other than stress pokes.
I am independent as well.  It's always 2 horrible politicians to choose from.  I'm just curious where the logically sound are in politics.
Utahns Speak Out is a Facebook group attempting to setup the townhalls.  They will notify people if they get a response.  I have to admit they are slightly annoyed with our representatives at the moment.  
Not when it comes to their children's education.

I don't deserve to live but I don't deserve to die.  
DO YOUR JOB!
I'm so scared right now.  When I can I volunteer at a school but then wonder if using my 6 hours of energy a week to do it if I will lose my benefits.  I contemplate what I can do if I lose my insurance.  My medication is 12k a month.  I'm a "taker".  It is a struggle knowing that your try will never allow you to hold down a job.  Desperately wanting to be "normal" and knowing how little your life matters to a government whose policies may kill you.
Badge bunnies?  
How much would it cost to take care of our elderly and health insurance again?  Way less than that war.  Our military needs a break.  Our taxpayers need a break and aren't we tired of blowing up money?
May I buy IQ points?
He showed up and announced that he was giving away public lands and selling them for development to oil companies.  National Park services, teachers, and all of his constituents deeply troubled by Trump's first 3 weeks and what is happening locally as a result weren't in a great mood.  The Muslim Ban is villified here.  
We are organizing.  Upset now?  Wait until they start fracking.  We live on a fault line.  
Made me laugh.  Still don't wanna do him though.
Man, I am REALLY jealous of California right now.  
I am beginning to feel your workers need to unionize.
Encore Boat Builders just poked the consumers that care enough to boycott.
We can make a difference.  We can leave and let them sort it.  They are tribally controlled.
I disagree.  I'm tired of both parties at this point.  Same corruption different party.  
I hope that the attitude changes towards police but I do think policy changes are creating problems.  People are just pissed at the government and you guys are taking the hit.  I have to admit that I've become a bit protective towards my police officer that lives across the street.  My family drops of Starbucks cards, washes his car, and I constantly feed his dog treats.  I don't know if that makes me strange.  I want to protest selling off public lands at townhalls but not create problems for our guys.  I want to create a reporting app so that is people are trying to create issues like vandalizing public signs (thanks for making us look like assholes) we can report it and work with police to keep people on their best behavior.  Also clean up your trash for the love of goodness!  
Thank you.
It's part of his job?
I would either start crying or vomit.
My first thought every morning is if I should kill myself.  Being body slammed awake by pain and medical issues that will never get better is difficult.  I acknowledge it and mentally confirm "not today".
We have to switch to solar and give people the ability to choose.  That's what 1 spend for a 5 bedroom house with bad insulation.  
I like you.  POVERTY is an issue everyone can get behind.  The rest is social issues that they use as a distraction.  Look we decided "this type of person" deserves human rights TOO!  All the while stealing from our pantries.  
Yes.
We can hope so.  I'd like machines investing my money.
I have a rule with my daughter.  I gather up a pile of things and put them in a garbage bag.  Label it.  If you don't notice any of the things in the bag are missing then you toss it after a month.  She loves having the room to color and being able to find the stuff she uses.  The stuff was creating more stress than the use.  
It's an issue.  Instead of investing in clean energy we are drilling.
Utahns Speak Out has information on upcoming protests, town halls, etc.
Marching in the streets will continue...
Yep.  Thanks for helping out Clintons.  As a country we could have had BERNIE.  Now even our allies are freaking out.
You get to breathe?  It's bunker time down here.  No more fresh delicious food just MRE's and sadness.  We hope they will let us out to work on that wall occasionally.  Just to prove we're able bodied enough for some of that Flint water.  At least your pennies will be worth something.  
Does this include retirement/investments?  
I'm so sick of this crap.  Money, money, money...this is why they lost and will continue to lose.
Ultimately they want UT handling education.  We are 49th in the country and they currently have teachers rationing paper.  Most college graduates leave due to how poorly our teachers are compensated.  Federal standards allow children to move from state to state with basic outlines of what material has been covered.  No one should be able to buy their way into a cabinet position.\n\n*Vouchers are a terrible idea.  Every teacher I've spoken with is horrified at the idea that there won't be a federal standard for when children are taught basic skills.
Paris Hilton has access to opportunity but intelligence?  Nope.
I like you so much.  Seriously.  This has been an abusive toxic relationship.  We can't afford it.
I am not going to lie.  Your facts made me embarassed.  Then I realized I like facts.  In this crazy world please keep your facts and remind the rest of us if we need more information.  
Research the topic and trust yourself after you have answers.
I did naturalize.  Coming from Canada I knew much of the civics and historical questions on the test but I was scared silly throughout the process.  Depending on length of time in the country and age many do not have to demonstrate fluency in English but most will.  There are citizenship classes and specialized attorneys that are helpful.  Those who have not naturalized need all the support they can get if they apply, especially in our post inauguration reality.
RIP Public education and Special ed.  This is a sad day for the Dakota Access protest, women's rights and education.  Vote the bums out!
I hate Trump.  Despise what is happening however the DNC picked the candidate.  I am pissed.  Democrats AND Republicans are bought and paid for...we can march in the streets all day long and when we attempt to be treated fairly (prescription drug costs) they vote AGAINST us.  There is no party FOR the people anymore.  Oligarchs will continue to use our protests to push their agenda which seems to be never ending war and making it legal to chip away at human rights.  Abuse of power is being seen everywhere.  Take a million homes and make a billion dollars.  Ignore communities like Flint or Hurricane Katrina unless you can make a buck.  Other countries actually provide services to people in exchange for taxes.  Our government is a violent mooch.  Prolife should be antiwar.  If we value human life you aren't ok funding only bombs.  We are BROKE and you want my kids to go without clean water so some jackass can make billions selling our natural resources?  Does it benefit US?  No just one or two people that get a pass on paying taxes.  We get sick, 28 people get a job.  If it spills we pay for cleanup.  We are fucked.
Agreed.
I am jealous.  Canadians are lucky, lucky, lucky.  All I have is an orange cheetoh.

Count me in.  Have felt adrift since leaving the Dems and not crazy about the greens.  
There is a Los Banos CA US naturalized citizen stuck in a middle eastern hotel waiting to bring his 12 yo daughter back from Yemen.  His wife is naturalized, his other 2 children are citizens and back home.  They have tried to bring back their daughter for 5 years from Yemen and were finally given the go ahead.  He has joined in a lawsuit against Trump.  I personally do not think it is reasonable to deny a child's entry.  I think this is a horrible play on people's fears and prejudices.  We have more to fear from home grown terrorists than from refugees.
"Many have defended Manchin and Heitkamp, saying that their moderate stances are the only things keeping them in office, still as we watch Pruitt and Trump dismantle the EPA and neglect the environment, will that be any excuse?"
Bernie would've won.

Fight on Bernie!
I too worked as a farm laborer in my early 20's picking strawberries, asparagus, and apples.  I agree with everything you say about working in the fields.  I have gratitude for anyone doing this type of work.  To round people up for deportation seems so counter-productive and mean spirited.  
Yes, when I first moved here the Canadian plan was paying for our coverage.  Again no deductibles!
I must respectfully disagree.  I watched the press conference and all I saw was a bullying liar wasting everyone's time.
They have changed the focus to March For Science to be more inclusive to "non-scientists" like students, families.  Lots of enthusiasm and the beginnings of nation wide and international organizing.
Yes, and you don't even have to be rich to receive medical care in the US.  Medical insurance covers you for 6 months when out of country.  However, they reimburse for costs based on what they would pay for Canadian services.  Wise for Canadians to buy travel medical coverage to supplement the difference.
I agree.  I have noticed a certain level of disability as I face age 69 and definitely would have a hard time holding down a part time job.  There has been a growing realization that I will not stay forever young.   As my nurse daughter exclaimed to me when I mentioned full SSA retirement age at 67, "But Mom, that's when people start dying!"  
"Played" is a very accurate description.  It will be so funny when crops are left to fallow here in California due to lack of agricultural workers.  Maybe they can force those receiving unemployment benefits to pick up the slack.  Or teenagers? \n\nI discussed naturalization with my son in law and the reason why he has not applied is the cost, $725 up front, and then there would be the cost of a passport on top of that.  The US will make a fortune in fees!
No, it was our fearless leader.

Then they can negotiate their salaries and hire attorneys to protect their rights.
I am an ex green card holder from Canada, naturalized in 1990. I recently married my sweetheart who is a US born citizen.  We are concerned that a visit to Canada where my family live could somehow deem us less "American."  Even though I renounced foreign potentates, Canada still recognizes me as a dual citizen!  My son-in-law is a legal resident alien from Mexico, married to a naturalized citizen (my daughter.) They both came here at age 8!  So far this looks like a religious (and cultural) exclusion of Moslems, but it could get worse before it gets better.  Trump's moves are very disturbing.
Can Ellison decline?
"The vast majority of us aren’t protesting because we loved Hillary and she lost. We’re protesting because we’re against Trump’s racist bans, walls, and registries. We’re protesting because we want to defend abortion rights and collective bargaining rights and the rest against the vile judges Trump wants to put on the Supreme Court. We know damn well that, as George Carlin so memorably predicted, “they’re coming for your Social Security,” and with Paul Ryan as Speaker, Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader, and Trump as President, we’ve never been in greater danger of the Carlin Prophecy coming true."
Complain!  No way.  Becoming naturalized after going through the legal resident alien process is a scary thing from start to finish. It was some honorable judge of some sort.  I had already taken a course on the US constitution in order to get prepared for the test for citizenship (and a CA teaching credential).  I kind of found it humorous.  But what was strange was I was surrounded by all these "trained professionals," coming to America, ready and willing to jump in, work hard and finally vote again.  They were from all over the world.  They seemed friendly and very reasonable.  The judge was ad libbing and just got in over his head.  But I do love America. The ideals of America are beautiful.  Diversity is its greatest strength.  
Looks like someone wearing a black jacket with white shirt underneath reaching out with a lighter.  Didn't see hair actually being burnt.  It shouldn't be too hard for people to identify who it was.  Not a lot of people in black jackets close by.

Gee, where are you living?  I was in BC.
I don't agree although it may be true in other states.   My daughter is a California RN (part time) and makes about $90,000 per year.  She has her RN through a college system without a degree.  She makes 3 times what I made and I have a BA level degree and a masters.  But then I was a teacher and later a social worker.  Professions that are paid a lower rate.

Fortunately I have a brain and use it to assess situations on many levels.  Critical thinking skills are what is driving the Revolution.  I viewed the commercial's message of acceptance as trumping the message of division.  It found a large audience at just the right time.  
But why 5 phone calls?  There is more to this scenario than has been explained.  Shouldn't Trump give an reasonable explanation to the public?  He would have access to what was said.  The administration's surrogates seem to be going to great lengths to make sure the public knows that Pence knew nothing about this, Trump has known for 3 weeks.  Why didn't Trump talk with his Vice President?  
I have a nasty Saturn mars conjunct in Leo, 12th house.  I was told by an astrologer years ago that difficulties in the 12th involves hidden plots, enemies and possible imprisonment as well as affecting one's subconscious and dreams.  I doubt Trump will be imprisoned (he is 70 and President, big mitigating factors) but the enemies part sure makes sense.  The transiting Pluto conjunct Saturn in the 11th will affect his friend relationships adversely.  Trump is definitely here to shake things up!
Tell me about it!  I am fast approaching 69!  Fortunately I can still vote against Feinstein.
I have Dianne Feinstein in California.  She says she will run again.  Vote her out!
Kern County is the fourth most productive agricultural county.  If Big Oil, the EPA, Jerry Brown and multinational corporations, combined with ICE deportations, have their way with our state, pretty soon non of our crops will be edible! https://www.bakersfieldchamber.org/agrilculture/
And pay for daycare as well on minimum wage.
How is this comment in good faith?
Bernie Sanders is a rare and inspiring leader.  I am sorry he lost the primary but we must fight on.  We may be leaderless and dispersed but we know what he taught.  Stick to the issues, think independently, work for the peace and security of others.  I am sick of people putting him down and find it hard to read Caitlin's essays anymore.  The American people have the President they voted for and deserve.  
Finally, father and 12 yo daughter expected in San Francisco Sunday afternoon.  Welcome home!\nhttp://fox40.com/2017/02/03/central-valley-father-daughter-to-return-home-from-yemen-following-block-on-trumps-travel-ban/
I first worked in the US as a welfare worker and was surprised that one family who was applying was still making payments 14 years later after the birth of their daughter. Surprised because its FREE in Canada where I was born. I can see that you may not want to help pay for another's costs but what if you had big costs?  What if you had cancer and the rest of us wanted no part of helping for your surgery or chemo?  Socialized medicine is cheaper for all because everyone pays for it together.  Costs are negotiated downward, as are prescription meds.
Many of the people who run don't even submit a statement and are no opponents.  Don't sell yourself short.  Go to a few meetings and see if it is for you.
She's a dual citizen as she was born in Morocco.  She had a passport.  Canadians do not require a visa.
She wanted to know if she would be able to continue to get Medicaid if Obamacare trashed.
I remember and I won't forgive.  I remember PBS Judy Woodruff laughing in Bernie's face, demeaning the issues.  Now I see her as an older woman who is on her way out.  ... I loved this journalist's ending remarks.  \n\n"Here in the capital city, every pundit and every would-be pundit identifies upward, always upward. We cling to our credentials and our professional-class fantasies, hobnobbing with senators and governors, trading witticisms with friendly Cabinet officials, helping ourselves to the champagne and lobster. Everyone wants to know our opinion, we like to believe, or to celebrate our birthday, or to find out where we went for cocktails after work last night.\n\nUntil the day, that is, when you wake up and learn that the tycoon behind your media concern has changed his mind and everyone is laid off and that it was never really about you in the first place. Gone, the private office or award-winning column or cable-news show. The checks start bouncing. The booker at MSNBC stops calling. And suddenly you find that you are a middle-aged maker of paragraphs—of useless things—dumped out into a billionaire’s world that has no need for you, and doesn’t really give a damn about your degree in comparative literature from Brown. You start to think a little differently about universal health care and tuition-free college and Wall Street bailouts. But of course it is too late now. Too late for all of us."
I guess extramarital sex is OK.
I was very disappointed too.  However if voters in her state have a choice between Elizabeth and some really terrible repub. I would not fault them in voting for her. 
California father and his Yemen born daughter finally coming home on Sunday afternoon.  http://fox40.com/2017/02/03/central-valley-father-daughter-to-return-home-from-yemen-following-block-on-trumps-travel-ban/
Harris has just started but I might, depending on how she continues to vote.  
This is terrible.  I feel empathy towards those poor people.  My husband got hit with an overpayment but it was due to the employer incorrectly reporting wages.  We went to our appeal three times in total but finally won.  Fortunately we had time sheets, wage stubs and a calendar of hours to prove when and how much was earned (and reported).  Keep copies of everything work related for at least 2 years if you receive UI (food stamps, welfare, etc) and also have earnings.
Ted is full of it.  He didn't stay in Canada long enough to make a good assessment.  I don't know one Canadian who has gone elsewhere to get surgeries and my family lives in Canada. 
Yes, I see the 11th house issues, especially with females.  Poor guy.  I think the chart makes a lot of sense I just don't feel as confident of his ability to be a President.  But, I am a Taurus, Virgo rising, Capricorn moon so I like it pretty safe.
 Such a brave heart!
Thank you!
I can't see how these things happen.  Why do people always wait till the last possible minute to file (even if the wrong date)?  I usually give myself a week early for important deadlines.  
There is a GoFundMe account set up to help this family.  https://www.gofundme.com/AliFamilyFund
Wow! Down voted.
He has mars in Leo in the 12th house as well as Pluto, both major players.  While the extra energy of mars conjunct ascendant gives him strong leadership qualities, the planet placements in the 12th house indicates hidden enemies and possible imprisonment. His conjunction of Sun and Uranus in the 10th (occupations) indicates mental agility in the field of business but his mercurial nature is made even more so with the opposition of moon in Sag.  there is a trine aspect which strengthens his sun and Uranus. I see a wild ride ahead.  More tweeting and reversals.  Overall, the chart fits in many ways what we know of Trump.  It is an interesting chart, don't you think?
We've had a drought for many years and a huge amount of rain and snow lately.  The rivers are really high and there has been a lot of flooding in California lately.
Here's a link to some info.  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/solidarity/  The fight had been brewing for some time after the re-elected conservative govt brought in unpopular legislation against teachers, unions, the poor and elderly.  Any general strike needs clear reasons for the action and to choose leaders leaders wisely in this type of action.  Many BC strikers felt used and ripped off after the strike was settled without their input.
We don't.  The press is paid to sit there but the rest of us can shun this clown.
Over one million people (so far) have signed a petition to keep Trump from visiting the the U.K.
Agree.  They want us fearful or angry.  Easier to control.
Yes, like we all need c-sections!
"My advice would be to throw sand in the gears,” said Kenney, who was the first State Department official to resign over Bosnia. “You’re not going to do anybody any good by leaving. Nobody is going to listen to you. If you work in the EPA and think the Trump people are the devil, you and every mid-level person who can, mount an internal resistance. There should be opportunities for people who are smart to act in a classic bureaucratic passive-aggressive manner and just be obstructionist. It’s a situation that lends itself to creative opposition from within.”"
I guess a new list will have to be created.
However, millions of women, men and children didn't go to Washington, carpooled to a local march,  carried their own signs and didn't go based on the speakers but on their own personal concerns like equal pay, protection of women's rights, climate change, immigrant rights, or simply disliking the words of our newest president.  I personally think their participation counts and don't give a fig about the opinion of those putting them down.  
Where was the reaching out to find common ground from the people on this video?  
There's one in every crowd!  
"Ultimately, he said, his intent was to let men have a say. “I believe one of the breakdowns in our society is that we have excluded the man out of all of these types of decisions,” he said. “I understand that they feel like that is their body,” he said of women. “I feel like it is a separate — what I call them is, is you’re a ‘host.’ And you know when you enter into a relationship you’re going to be that host and so, you know, if you pre-know that then take all precautions and don’t get pregnant,” he explained. “So that’s where I’m at. I’m like, hey, your body is your body and be responsible with it. But after you’re irresponsible then don’t claim, well, I can just go and do this with another body, when you’re the host and you invited that in.”  \n\nThey wonder why women march.  Hopefully science will find a way to implant the fetus into a more willing "host".  Perhaps the men having babies will learn something in the process of pregnancy, delivery, and parenting for at least 18 years.  
I actually was part of a general strike in BC in the 80's.  It was Started by the teachers (who have a province wide union) and the nurses.  Students, professors, seniors and other groups represented by unions went out on strike over about a week.  It was exciting and pretty well organized.  Unfortunately the forward momentum was halted by a negotiation between the Premier and a labor leader.
I personally am freaked out.  I am naturalized from Canada after being here 30+ years.  Today I have researched answers to being "de-naturalized" and crossing the border back into the US if I visit Canada, where my family lives.  Apparently you can refuse to give info on social media and passwords, which I have a hard time remembering in the best of times, but then they can confiscate your laptops, electronic items and phones.  I actually avoid social media but feel I should have a right to privacy.  My son in law is a legal resident from Mexico and is taking his family to Disneyland this week.  God forbid they get pulled over.  Waiting for us to retake Congress might not help those who are being terrorized currently.  And yes I know about Obama's deportations.   
Do they (the male nurses) have a union?  I would think they have grievances to file.  But I disagree with your analysis of the pay gap between men and women.  I am a woman with 10+ years post secondary education and have faced discrimination and witnessed the same treatment of others.
The question is, "Why do we care about the rich?"  
Interesting.  When I went for my Sacramento naturalization ceremony in 1992 we were lectured on how we need to inform on anyone who is breaking American drug laws and that the US is a Christian country.  It was amazing to say the least. 
I don't know if I entirely believe her.  Her family should choose a better plan.  Nurse Practitioners make a lot of money.  
And expected.  The president is a narcissist.  It craves attention and is getting it non stop.  
Don't criticize what you don't understand Julian.  The reasons why people marched are as diverse as the number of marchers.  
Why do Trump supporters feel the need to type like Trump does? It's kind of pathetic, lmao
Yes, that's very true.  I don't have to use Airbnb to enjoy their commercial.  I don't like the sharing economy much and will probably never use.
Yes, that may be true.  It is reported that people drove through the snow to get there as well.  McClintock is an ultra conservative carpetbagger to start out with.  I have no problem with Roseville or Sacramento folks fighting back.  Maybe he should just stop holding town halls if people want to show up to report their complaints.
Hey, it's great.  For example I had prenatal visits, a regular birth, 10 days of rooming in for me and my daughter after her birth and a public health nurse checking in on me at NO cost.  Later I needed a hysterectomy, again had a 10 day stay, and a home visiting health nurse for an additional month at NO cost. My wait time for the latter surgery was 2 weeks.  And I lived in a rural area!
I saw this and am angry and afraid.  I just wrote to my son in law who is a green card holder to see if he would like to naturalize.  It's expensive,  but he has been here since age 8 so will have no problem with the test and interview.  I am naturalized but I don't carry my passport or naturalization papers with me at all times.  Is this where this is leading?  I read today about a NASA employee who had to give up his protected phone and pin to customs even though he is a citizen. It seems that immigration and border agents have been given too much power to ruin or disrupt lives.
I am a retired clinical social worker and hope to march in Sacramento.  For years I have watched the vulnerable in our society fall deeper into poverty while the wealthy have lived lives of luxury.  I first heard about climate change in 1968 and have watched the cumulative effects on our environment.  I strongly believe that human ingenuity, technology and science can mitigate the damage we as a species will face in the near future.  
But timing is everything.  Still have a bitter memory of the shut down.
Ah ha!  Sounds familiar...
Yes and our new senator from CA, Kamala Harris, failed to prosecute this creep!  
Thank you.  California: Feinstein, 4 yes votes (of course) and Kamala Harris 2 out of 4.  
But the district includes Grass Valley, Nevada City and South Lake Tahoe who lean blue.  Also in Placerville there was a strong Democrat presence.  On the news one attendee said he had been going to these town halls for years and never had seen anything like it.  When we lived in his district we never went to his town halls since we knew we were outnumbered.  But Our Revolution and others have changed the conversation finally.
When did he claim to hate white people? I don't ever remember him saying that.
Enough (positive) Trump spam. It's implied.
I thought the rules said to participate in good faith?
The Great Below needs to go to the great below.
People here downvote anyone with an opinion different from theirs. Last time I said this I had -2.
I think he wants the element of surprise. Doesn't want to give anything away.
Disagreed with Bush. Don't think he's a bully and I still respect him. Same with McCain, Romney and Pence. I think Trump is a bully and I don't respect him. It's more than just the typical political disagreement.
Didn't realize there was a big MM-Future crossover! Can't wait for the album, I hope it's like DS2.
It's crazy how wrong you are. Kanye was the first rapper to make it big without using the stereotypical gangsta or thug personality. With Graduation, he introduced electronic music to hip hop in a big way. 808s and Heartbreak was an innocent Kanye, with the use of autotune and talking about his emotions. This is his most influential album yet, paving the way for artists like Drake. Yeezus exposed people to industrial and experimental hip hop. While I admit Kanye wasn't the first to experiment with industrial music, he was the first to do it in the mainstream.\n\nPlease tell me what the Black Eyed Peas have done for music. I'm struggling to come up with anything.
First, if you didn't know, more people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by 3 million votes, but our electoral college system chose Donald Trump. Most Americans didn't vote for him, so please don't think we're all idiots.\n\nBut to answer your question, his administration's ties with Russia and his overall unpresidential behavior is making even Trump voters shy away from him. His current approval ratings are in the low 40s, the worst of any president ever.
As a guy who listens to artists ranging from Young Thug and Lil Yachty to Pink Floyd and The Beatles, I'll never understand these people. There's something special about *all* genres of music. Not all music has to be innovative or timeless to be enjoyable.
RemindMe! June 5, 2017
You know what the funny thing is? I don't see a single Trump supporter in this comment section trying to defend this.
I never called Kanye the most influential rapper. There a quite a few more rappers that have had a larger influence than him. I'm just saying that you need to give him more credit than you think.\n\nBasically all of these new school rappers cite Kanye as their biggest influence. Or is it just a coincidence that they have a similar style to Kanye's fourth album? \n\nI've given you so many examples and a source for my information yet you still refuse to acknowledge that he's had an effect on hip hop.\n\nAnd rap is objectively not all about lyrics. Even back in the early 90s, there were only a few conscious rappers. For myself and many other people, flows and beats come before lyrics. And I say that as a huge Kendrick Lamar, Danny Brown, and RTJ fan.
What are you pointing out?
Land of Rape and Honey is my favorite Ministry album.
Bad people can make good music. Would you not listen to any of John Lennon's music since he was an asshole?
See, mods? Removing posts like this is why people are uninformed.
People, stop upvoting this because it's funny. It doesn't belong in this subreddit.
I love the cluttered beats, mostly. Ride effortlessly flows over these beats that sound so hard to keep tempo on. My favorite of the two is Fuck That. The nonstop onslaught of vocals with the cluttered beat is what does it for me, it's kind of hard to explain. 
I'm not sure if one will be needed. Just noticed /u/unsaneroot (a mod here) said he'd look into what's been going on. But I'm up for anything!
/r/nothingeverhappens
Our electoral college system is fucked up. It elected the candidate with less votes two times in the last five elections. It's horrible.
The comment says "bother"
I expected an album, like Manson has been teasing for the past few months? This wasn't like the ACSS boxset. Manson gave us a specific date multiple times, mentioned it was "coming in hot", and didn't release anything. Tyler's tweet makes me think this is a mistake rather than intentional.
Not OP but I'd eliminate The Cage.
True, I guess the word should be "remember"
I'm a liberal who is giving President Trump time to prove himself, and it's not looking so good right now. I'll give him the rest of his term, but as of now I'm definitely not voting for him in 2020.
Has this kid actually heard any classic hip hop? The subject matter was often the same as today's 
Thank you so much!
That's some true 4D chess.
His face lmfao
He was a mod at /r/nin for a few months. Fucking destroyed the subreddit. We got rid of him yesterday after the community complained about him enough. I'm not sure what happened to him over here, but there are a lot more posts lately in this sub. I'm glad he's gone.
Your opinion is wrong.
Wow. This is a sub for Trump supporters answering questions, so thank you for answering, but *wow*. I didn't know people thought like that.
Hillary's aides never had ties with other countries from what I've heard
Glad to see The Pale Emperor so high. It's my second favorite Manson album.
Did they seriously remove your post asking about the mass deletions? That's unacceptable. Did they give you an explanation in a PM?
User Friendly gets overlooked way too much. Manson's delivery and lyrics are so great, as well as the instrumental. Probably my favorite track on Mechanical Animals.
As someone who's a Kanye fan, you're incredibly uninformed.
Do you have a source stating that Trump made him quit?
Not to mention his blatant hypocrisy. He'll say one thing and deny he ever mentioned it the next day.
Read the stickied post.
I really hope so. :/
People, please upvote these posts so they get more exposure. It's sitting at only +2 right now.
Something's telling me that you were never a fan. Em presented himself as a thug a lot, he rapped about guns, the hood, killing people, etc. He relied on the tough guy image. ICP didn't have anywhere near the reach Kanye did, and even if they did, all they talked about was murder and cannibalism.\n\nI'm still confused about why you chose the Black Eyed Peas as an example. You called them more influential and said that's a fact, just to say you really didn't mean it - to prove what, exactly?\n\nRead the "legacy" section of Kanye's wiki page. That'll give you a good idea of what he's done. And all Kanye fans realize he's not the best with lyrics, because his music is more about the production and beats. He does have his moments once in a while, though.
I still love that place. Some of the posts are a bit excessive, but once every few days there's a gem.
Thank you for looking into this! You seem to be the first mod to respond.
I say drive the three hours to Columbus. Who knows when the next tour will be.
I'm sorry, but how at all was the OP rude? This is one of the nicer posts I've seen in this subreddit.
Most of us didn't vote for these buffoons.
That was a week ago! In a week we can go from not knowing anything about the physical component to having it delivered to us. We need these threads.
Various Methods of Escape 
You got it!
That's why the post says:\n\n>Like I said, food for thought. Not making a claim.
Ok, I understand. Sorry. I'd be careful mentioning that around here, most PF fans aren't too tolerant.
I'm not complaining at all but how did Chance win over Views if Views is nominated for AOTY?
Just finished mine. Filled out the exact opposite of what they want to hear.
_________ capital of the world.
If you used to be a fan of Kanye then you should know that he's changed the face of music and that he received an honorary doctorate from a Chicago university. I trust those achievements more than "small loan of a million dollars", draft-dodging Trump whose businesses have gone bankrupt multiple times.
The Big Come Down is my favorite song on the the album :( that falsetto is amazing.
No problem!
You made a generalization of an artist you're not educated on. That's a bit uninformed.
Not what I had in mind, but that works too!
Wait a hour and we might even have two albums!
Listen to ILOVEITWHENTHEYRUN, Take a Step Back, and Imsippinteainyohood
Trent helped write Suck, it's not just a cover.
I hope they give his other songs a listen. X could be huge
Ban this person, mods. I'm not joking.
That's the correct spelling in the US.
Yeah it's ridiculous. Nobody knows the situation about the shipping because you mods keep deleting posts about them, so people make posts asking about the shipping, creating a full circle. You're adding fuel to the fire, mods! I liked this place better pre-NTAE or before this mass-deleting started, it was much more enjoyable then. The community has spoken and they're not happy.
Who's the president?
Something to add: Please at least give us an update on your decision through a post or something. We want our voices heard.
A lot can change in a week or two.
I don't agree with it either, but I try to separate the person and the music. Lennon beat his wife and kids, but I still listen to his music.
Careful, don't get yourself banned ;)
Trent rerecorded the song by himself for Broken, after helping write it in the first place. He even did the vocals on the "original" version. Can you cover a song that you did vocals on in the first place? I don't even know.
Good. I'm a big fan of both of them.
Once again, I'd like to thank you for saving this community. I had lost interest in what was once my favorite sub, and now it's back to normal!
What makes you think it's just a typical exaggeration? It's not an exaggeration in my eyes, it's a lie. It's just hypocritical that Trump blasts the MSM's "fake news", then spreads lies about his victory.
Those are my two favorites! Just goes to show how great an album TMS is.
Don't worry, I get your reference.
His last six albums have all gone #1. He's relevant as ever. And critics have named his "shit music" some of the best music of the century. Check any of his album's wiki pages and you'll see. Use better arguments next time.
Do we choose the one we like more or less? Some survivor series change it up for the last round, and the description isn't exactly clear.
This survivor is actually including most of my favorites! Voting The Great Below out this time.
Every country has its problems :( they're trying to improve and that's all that matters. No need to insult 1.5 billion people's home country.
How didn't I know this existed? Thanks for posting, I really enjoy this.
No, we didn't. Clinton received 3 million more votes.
Goodbye, The Great Below. You won't be missed.
I was thinking the same thing. This subreddit is suffering, and basically the entire community doesn't agree with how things are being handled. It needs to change.
This album will forever be a classic. One of the best albums ever released.
Filth Pig is a great album. If you're a NIN fan do yourself a favor and listen to it.
Never mind. I'm dumb.
Is there some unwritten rule that all NIN tracks have to be written by only Trent? It's just one of the rare times Trent worked with other people while songwriting.
It's a bit odd that you're not going to judge a president's re-electability by his first term in office.
No, you literally said you haven't listened to him in your original comment. 
How's the carrying handle?
Does it use the wands in VR?
It's been confirmed that the veterans discount still applies to the new unlimited plan.
Minus the fat, it looks like me after a few hours of playing with my Vive.
Do you use over 200 GB a month?
I want it with motion controls! 
This is nothing like 3D movies. Once this gets through the enthusiast phase and into mass marketing/manufacturing, the prices will go down and people will buy them. I've had a ton of people try my Vive and nobody disliked it despite a few instances of nauseousness. Even the nauseous people wanted to ty it again.
"customers that eat more than 200 GB in any given month"
I'm in Maryland and I wouldn't mind one of those on my property.
They're just cutting people who go over 200 gigs a month.
Wow, nobody posted that image of two neckbeards chatting to each other using those emotes. Am shocked.
Once mass production happens the price to produce falls rapidly.
The money you get from the VA should not be reported to anyone. 
I think they said everything was a placeholder.
Probably for about $10k, lol.
I didn't know that I wanted a chrome pistol grip and bcg until this post. I really like that.
Does it play as well as Doom in VR? That sounds really cool.
Il Fornos > J&P's > Bellasarios (sp?) > Ledos > PP Creations > Costco\n\nThat doesn't look that bad though.
It is a learning experience. Instead of siding with corporate shills and getting them up the ranks to contend against Republican presidential nominees, you pluck them at the stem before they blossom. If Democrats intend to win another elections, they have to regain unity. Anyone who voted against a measure to negotiate drug prices is essentially undemocratic. It's unfortunate that a decent local level politician did what he did, but he shouldn't be able to pull a Hillary Clinton and divide the Democrats into a loss again.
I really wanted to post it up but my Google fu is weak. It's a little two panel "comic" with two neckbeards facing inwards towards their computers typing similarly to each other, presumably under false pretenses. It's pretty good.
The job was for web marketing and some "light" IT work. This was at a car dealership. So I go in for the interview and it goes pretty well until the guy asks me how I feel about selling cars. I reply with something like "isn't that part of marketing? I try to get people in the doors and the sales team takes it from there." The interviewer then says "yes but wouldn't you actually want to walk the floor and sell cars alongside of the sales team?" I was pretty puzzled and told him I wasn't interested in sales, but marketing, like the job description said. Afterwards he explained that the job was marketing/it in that I was to respond to all after hours inquiries via email in addition to doing that and walking the sales floor during the day. I kind of went "ehhhhhhhhhh... no" and got up left. They called me a couple times to offer the job so I'm thinking they must've had a terrible turnout for the position.
Tax free purchases. Not all that bad for pricey items.
God I love their pizza. 
Throw objects at the zombies (right in the head) to kill the slow ones earlier in the level to save your bullets. Took me a while to learn but if you do a baseball pitch with just about any item you can pick up, you can one-shot them.\n\nIt does sound like you might be bugged, though, as my first playthrough spawned infinite zombies there too. 
Pretty much any religion creates a political ideology among their followers because of what is written in their texts. Look at Christianity and how much it's brought up by the right.
That's quite the study totem poling if I've ever seen it.
Fixed that, fuck you.
That's odd, I use between 3 and 15 GB a month and I'm never getting super slow speeds.
Have you guys considered making a game based on the mechanics used in Quest? I'd pay money for a game like that. I think I played it for like four hours last night without realizing it.
Was there any single piece of evidence that contributed this though? 
If you're seriously worried about a little motion sickness, get a small fan and aim it towards yourself. It's how I learned to use my headset. Helps trick the brain.
Yup.
This is a fantastic game. I have it on the Vive and am happy to see it crossing boarders.\n\nHopefully it'll be cross platform.
ITT: people arguing over a question that didn't need to be asked being answered.
I believe GabeN himself said they're better in just about every way.
35% of an estimated 5% of the population.
That is heartbreaking but I'm glad you guys rescued him. You might have to do some shady stuff to actually keep him without them getting him back though... I think he's still considered property, but maybe someone else can chime in on how to keep a vice on him? Sometimes abusive families will try to get the dog back because of their pride/arrogance. The system often sucks but I'm hoping they never try to take him back.
I feel so helpless in that game because I can't use my hands. I want to love it though!
How much data do you use in a month?
Pretty neat system, but that commercial was, uh, interesting.
Are you still working on this or are you moving onto another project? Wondering if I should download it now or wait.
Quality shitpost. Seriously though, that's a pretty good game on its own.
Version VS 128 1/14ish purchase date, original shipping date 2/17, no emails until now (FedEx tracking #) saying it'll be here tomorrow afternoon. I feel lucky having only waited around a month.
You had me at psshht.
I believe that the thing to consider here is that porting is pretty easy. The big name success stories released on Vive and Oculus will likely see their time on PSVR.
Probably Silent Civilian. 
> they should have provided a third PSVR score.\n\nThis right here.
Haven't tried Laurienzos yet, but I wasn't too impressed by Pistaro's. Too much hype for a long wait and decent food. I will say they have above average meatballs though.
Just have a contractor who builds fences come out and check. Kind of similar in Maryland, but the guy I had who came out said it looked treated/fine and vouched for me.
I'm getting my Pixel next month supposedly, so I'll have to do a root before activating it. Was rooting pretty smooth for you? The last time I did this was on the OG Motorola Droid.
It took up about all of my GBP including a pretty heavy advance. I'm pretty happy with it, but I would be lying if I said I never thought of all the tendies that never were.
They worked with my agent, so all paperwork was funnelled through him, but I'm assuming he gave that info. I know I had to sign something and pay him anyway.
I know what you mean. I feel so helpless in some scenes because I can't move my arms individually. I've been spoiled by SteamVR.
Last I heard in the end of January, positional tracking is currently in the works.
I've been using unlimited data since back in the day, glad to see that they're reopening the doors to everyone again. 
That one is pretty awesome as well.
That looks really cool!
Hello Finnish.
When did you order it?
This is going to be great. The Chipotle out by Wegmans is pretty terrible and the one by the theater is starting to shrink their burritos and mess up orders (at least the last two times I went).
Wishlisted. Game looks like it has potential. I'd like to see more from the devs though, maybe a Facebook page or something.
They actually did just this for the court under the supreme court. 
I prefer this theme.
Any victory is a victory for someone. Even if it's not a huge one to someone else. \n\nThat being said, I tend to agree with you, but then again I only really played hardcore for pvm.
If you have a company discount the new udp will end up costing you more. It's 80+ taxes and fees according to the rep I was speaking to.
Not much at this time, but that changes if you look at my family members. 
Having watched 3D TV and experiencing VR I can still confidently say your comparison isn't accurate. The two mediums are only similar in early sales because they were/are a new product. Early cell phones also only sold to those who were enthusiasts as well. It's like comparing a bicycle to a car?
I've been waiting my whole life for good VR and it is totally worth it. There aren't enough games quite yet, but the ones that are good are **good**.
Looking sleepy!
Had I been drinking something it'd have been sprayed into my screen through my nose.
No call here, ordered Vzw VS 128 Jan 10th and was told Valentine's day order. Have yet to receive an order push back.
What is this, Half life VR? 
Can you source this for those who aren't familiar with this person?
Too lazy to submit, but good luck to all!
The people behind the counter often ignore you if you did an online order (even when it's slow). That and they make the smallest Chipotle burritos that I've ever seen and I've eaten at a ton of these places. They're like 65% of what you'd expect. You'll only get a "normal" burrito there if you ask for extra meat/other fillings. The last time I was there my burrito was about the size of a softball, this was with extra steak. 
It's the beginning of a new medium. Anything you just said could be applied to any new technology. \n\nHave you ever used a Vive or an Oculus w/ touch? 
Just curious, but what's a good price for bulk ammo?
I didn't even think about that (rotation thing). I beat it once last night and can't wait until I can try it again. 
I'm guessing OP is some sort of dachshund/human hybrid.
You've come to the right place.
I fully support this comment
I'm on it as well. Maybe they'll unlock tethering for us since it's coming with the new plan?
If you're being serious, addiction can take many forms. Maybe you should limit your playtime.
Not saying any abuse is understandable, but who could abuse that noble prince?
That looks pretty good. By pretty good I mean better than anything I'll ever do.
Looks kinda like Shrek.
I suppose that's what the serious tag might help with.
That's where I'm stuck.
Sounds about as credible as the nude code in Tomb Raider.
Those California burritos at Santana's are so good! Sometimes after eating those burritos if wake up drenched in sweat though... Not sure what's up with that.
I saw that episode! Currently we don't have that kind of brain scanning technology. That's quite a ways away.
Imagine the mod community. I'd use it if I could program and create smells. Imagine how cool it'd be if you made a cooking game that replicated the smells of whatever you were cooking. Or hell, walking around in a field in VR Elder Scrolls and smelling earth and grass, flowers... Trolls.
Mine was ordered a few weeks ago and they gave me a February 16th estimated ship date. 
What's your favorite VR experience? Are you able to drop any hints as to any games you're working on that we'll see, hopefully this year, on steamVR?
GBP is at an all time high, huzzah!
Odd considering the rarity of jalapenos being used on any given pizza. 
Some people say some small areas of Frederick tend to be dangerous, but the people who say that probably never stopped living in their parents basement. For the most part criminal types will leave you alone unless you get mixed up in their crowd. Just a heads up not to be too frightened if someone says something. 
I thought it was quite [smashing!](http://imgur.com/gallery/jU4n0fW)
Paul McCartney actually said when he was working with Kanye that "He reminds me of John."

That's what it's aaaaall been about. "Just how far can I really take this? Just how much money can I gather along the way?"
Or security questions 
I mean, I'm definitely not a Trump supporter, but the literal 24 hours after the inauguration is pretty much constant parties. 
I love the fascism checklist guy too!! I sure hope he replies to you. 
Congratulations from a fellow Californian. This was very inspiring.\n\nCan I also just say-This is an IDEAL post for what should be on this sub. This is the point of reopening, to continue the progressive movement, to build a grassroots, progressive machine to get these wonderful people elected. \n\nThis is EXACTLY what we need to be focusing on in this sub. 
"We're good because we're great." 
No no no-their defense is "You liberals think it's so bad, but Obama did it too."
Not sure, I don't think it's happened yet. I'm on the west coast. Scratch that-it's 9pm eastern 
Came here to say this. My brother lives in Finland. God damn it. Should I start getting scared? 
Its the jaaaaaaacket. *waving hand back and forth italian style*
Sounds like maybe an elk or something?
I think that one Ohio Jeff. He's an amateur researcher with a YouTube channel. A lot of people like him
That guy next to Irish and Johnson always bothers me because no one has any idea who he is. Still it's such a classic moment. 
"Just give him a chance."
No no this is much more "professional." It's mostly interviews of scientists who have chosen to research it, interpretations of the subject, and analysis of the Patterson film. 
That makes no sense. I'm talking about planting a tree in the spring
Loaned $500 to freshman roomate-never paid back\nLoaned $250 to sophomore roomate-never paid back\nLoaned $400 to second sophomore roomate-never paid back
My personal advice. You're overthinking waaaay too much. Just be yourself is all that matters. Send a text if you think that would be nice and say what you want to say. Sounds like she likes you and things went great so DON'T worry. Be confident in yourself and BE yourself. 
The only other one I can really think of would be this one by National Geographic \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcphwYaVNd0\n\nIt goes over reported stories and history-pretty interesting. \n\nThis is a much higher quality version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkzHZIK5yqs
God every scene with these two was hilarious 
Not there
Wouldn't they run anyways for a little publicity? 
This doesn't happen to be Summer Heights High, does it?
In both videos it sounds like there are at least two of them. Possibly calling to each other? 
We 
All we really need is dna. Just hair or blood or anything. That and one clear crisp undeniable video once and for all. 
I love that song so much. But Tall Trees really reminds me of True Grit-one of my favorite westerns. The snowy thick forests in the middle of no where. 
Now how many people are going to be smoking while playing the game? 
Not saying you're wrong but genuinely asking: Why do so many people believe Bannon is behind all these decisions? I mean I know he's pure solid evil to the core, but why him specifically? 
A Wire reference in SandersForPresident. Ahhhh what a time to be alive

If it gets huge attention, then yes they would care and pay attention. But that's unlikely. Personally, I think time is better spent by calling our own representatives. Everyone should read this: https://www.indivisibleguide.com/web
I also have a Bernie drawer. I can't bring myself to use all the stickers I have, knowing one day they'll be crumbled up and ruined. I want to get a little Bernie memory box one day. 
I love the fire coming from the engines 
It's a miracle they haven't already. 
That's really what I was referring to actually. I never noticed this in Blackwater. 
I agree, though even if she had won barely, that is no reason to celebrate completely. Bernie said this should have been a 10 point victory. Instead they got slaughtered. 
siiiiiiigh........you're probably right. 
I've heard your video many times. The only thing I can think of is maybe an injured bear. Or a bear fighting off a pack of wolves? 
Oh believe me, the voters came out. In San Diego, for the thousands of students who voted, if they didn't write down their dorm room number when they went to vote, their vote was not counted. Conveniently. 
Sorry, I don't :/ 
Not a tantrum, but when Paulie asks\n\n"You hungry ton? You want, I send the kid to pick up some baja fresh." 
I'm pretty sure provisional ballots were not counted. 
Nah. If she hasn't left him yet she won't now. I think she'll just lock herself up in Trump Tower. 
What exactly are these positions?
I just dont understand why it's 2017 and there's still a shit show of wires everywhere. 
Wow after the whole syrian refugee skittle thing and after Skittles saying "Leave us out of your politics" I never would have expected them to create "American Skittles."
Is that what they did for GTA V? 6 months with zero information seems completely ridiculous. 
"IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE."
Leave your lair and come to DC! 
Shaky would have been hilarious. But they really should have just used Seth!! The only reason they couldn't is because Seth was inside the fort, but still they could've had him go in after or something.

Care to share a little more? I'm very interested in joining too.

I loved when John said the power one to Reyes because he looked like he genuinely took that to heart. Then of course he just became another evil dictator. God damn it. 
Fully agreed. I mean, I still love Warren, she still is a progressive. But you're absolutely right. She is NO Bernie Sanders and she IS establishment. People say "come on, this is Elizabeth Warren were talking about" But you know what, actions speak louder than words. And if theres one thing Bernie taught us, it is hold your representatives to a higher standard. She was totally silent during the primaries and that showed her true colors. \n\nMLK once said "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." 
There is a surprising number of goth high schoolers who love him. The comments on his interviews on youtube are filled with people saying what a genius he was. Disturbing stuff. 
Yes
Yes, I did. Very much so actually. I still do at times. And it's a little harder to make friends or have a conversation when you know nothing about sports. The topic comes up constantly with everyone, everywhere. \n\nAnyway I stopped caring when I basically just became confident in who I am. Not liking sports doesn't make me worse than someone who does. 
Miss you, Jane. So much. Would have been a first lady on par with Eleanor Roosevelt. 
MMW needs someone who doesn't think like a moderator!! Make MMW Great Again! 
No prob!
I can't believe I forgot about that. He is a piece of shit. 
Tall Trees. The snow, the thick of the forest, the dead silence, the mountains. I end up there every time i play. 
MMW: All these people who are told they're on a list aren't actually on a list. 
Me too! Hi neighbor! 
Cat Cafes. Most are peaceful. But people are generally complete assholes and don't want to follow rules. So they'll treat the cats like toys and just cause a riot in the cafe. One just opened up in LA and I shutter at how it will turn out. 
How dare we question Perez's coronation. Better we focus on "party unity" and stop causing trouble.
I would kill for a more farming simulator. It was so much fun living as a typical rancher but you didn't really do anything. And having a deeper relationship with your horse is always a good idea. 
Thanks so much!
Vote SMEGHEAD! 
Richie. He was such an old school hard ass gangster. But god damn it why did he have to question everything Tony did? It was so frustrating to watch him dig his own grave.

Is there any way to see Bernie's upcoming events? I live in LA and it's stomach turning that I missed this chance and OTHERS to see Bernie. 
*immediately hums The Wire theme song*
Serious question: What is so difficult? How is this not a major emergency issue, especially for Michigan. And especially after having so much news coverage. What is preventing them from fixing this?
Oh don't worry that's coming too. 
Ok i am absolutely no trump supporter at all. But a president traveling around the country to give rallies during their term is nothing unusual. This is his response to his sinking approval rating. Obama did the EXACT same thing when his support went down. NOW the fact that he's doing this after just 1 month is pretty embarrassing. 
Yep. He's a New Deal Democrat. And to think that parasite Hillary had the nerve to say he wasn't a "true democrat." When she herself was literally a young republican. 
I doubt it-they already had their "make up guest appearance." Why would this just happen out of no where? 
Wha? Impore me? You...impooooooore me......?
wow. That was just disrespectful. Unbelievable arrogance. 
BRING BACK BIGFOOT and not a guy in a suit like GTA V-I am PRAYING they bring back real Red Dead Bigfoot 
Oceania has always been at war with East Asia
"Where?"
I'm pretty sure it would simply shield them from the possibility of being deported. 
Thank you. Yes I was also referring to their destruction of the camps. In the movie "Downfall" the nazis in Berlin are frantically burning as many papers as they can in all government buildings, as the Russians were closing in on the city. As soon as they were done with this, they fled or committed suicide. 
That is a good point. Hillary had Debbie Shultz, we can have Kieth Ellison 
Thank you. 
Reading these feels like reading those old depressing 90's cartoon theories. 
Omfg you're right. That's exactly what it felt like. 
Look the last thing I want to do is discourage activism, but these people could not give less of a shit about who comments on their FB page, and especially if they're not even you're representative. Call your own representatives. Tell them you and your family and friends and neighbors and peers and colleagues support that amendment. Tell them to support that amendment or they're not getting your vote next time. 
Like Pa always says, "Don't go waking snakes."
And maybe ask for evidence that stoned drivers are dangerous, and not just anecdotes
Is wasn't meant to be informative. It was suggesting that since you seem to be passionate about the subject that you should help fix the problem.\n\nAnd then it was suggesting that you probably wouldn't choose Burlington proper as your location to do that in.
If it dries out between leaks you won't need to spray anything. Just get up there and feel it out.
You don't have to, but they're blocking the vent and shitting.\n\nHonestly that's probably all the damage they're doing right now.\n\nProbably good to evict them eventually however
Just a thought that you may want to test the soil where you'll be keeping them. Lots of property in Burlington has elevated levels of lead in the soil, and chickens pick up grit and therefore could be adding lead to your eggs if you have it in your soil. It's super easy to do a soil test through UVM\n\n(only reason I don't keep chickens at my place)
The math might work on a ten year ROI period, but not on a five year ROI period.\n\nThat alone could keep a nationwide chain from implementing
Welp, I guess spring is in Pennsylvania
> it's possible that we will keep him around\n\nJeebus, who put you in charge?\n\nYou speakin for me?
So what?\n\nI have one question for you:\n\nWhy are you mad at MMM for making money after he retired?
I'm guessing that OP uses it for bedding. Just a guess though.\n/u/sbharnish ?
Also, it's potentially a larger land base to allow the asset to become productive.....\n\nI.E., rent that land out to a nearby farm after you buy it, or put up a trailer and air b'n'b it, or whatever
You've never heard of a dirt floor cellar? \nThey all used to be dirt floor....
There are no taxes in this bill
I just chose it as an example. We know that the math works for solar in most cases, it's just a question of payback period. I'm not entirely sure what the senator was referring to in her statement that you quoted, but I was making the point that requiring rooftop solar on big box stores may be necessary to get them to pony up and put in the project, even if it is in their best interest in the long run
They maybe got spooked because your neighbor (or whoever placed the call) called the cops on them.  Go thank that person very sincerely.\n\nBe vigilant that whoever stopped by now knows how to get in to your house (apparently without breaking anything) and knows what you have and where it is.\n\nTime to fix the alarm system and replace the door locks with some that can't be "bumped"?
Start up a company developing in properties specializing in "middle-class and below" housing.\n\nI bet you won't be building in most of Burlington either, because you won't be able to make an income.
Yes, honestly that's where my aversion to the lingo comes from. It's cute when it's all in the same space with other people using it, but I'm hoping it stays in that subreddit and doesn't enter common usage......
And make them spray another (or more) arrows on the fence?\n\nNothing like pissing off local utility workers, whom you'll never need to benefit from their services ever again!
Yeah but you're totally forgetting the pre-emptive strike on armed disputed islands in the South China sea!
Because the potential tax revenue is one of the main reasons to get conservatives to go along with legalization at all

There are lots of reasons that renting isn't just burning money. And lots of reasons to buy instead of rent. There is no one size fits all.\n\n
It takes days longer than these are typically utilized for a sprout to start photosynthesizing enough energy to "feed itself". At the stage at which they're fed out they're mostly growing off of stored energy from the grain
What you are describing sounds to me more like "ecological agriculture". \n\nThe folks I've seen studying agroecology tend to be closely aligned with social science methodologies (though often incorporating agricultural focus and study).\n\nThat being said, I've never heard an agroecologist stick with one definition, or to all agree on the same definition.\n\n(And even though that's my experience, the department that you're considering may define agroecology more along the lines of what I just called ecological agriculture. Think of this as an advantage, you can make it what you want of it, to an extent. Also, let me know if they need a post-doc!)\n\nEdit to add: You can find researchers that let ideology get in the way of science in any field. Be cautious of them (in all directions - pro and anti whatever the subject is)
Fletcher Free Library?
You've already identified the leak. You need a new gasket/flashing (whatever, I'm not a roofer) at that penetration.\n\nI would just bite the bullet, get a roofer in for $500-$1k and have them fix it properly (tar isn't going to do it), and not worry about it.  Ask them to check for other issues while they're there.\n\nYou can try getting something out of your home inspector for missing the obvious leak damage from inside the attic, but I've never heard of anyone being able to do so. Check with /r/realestate if you want, I think they'll say similar.
Exactly, equally foolish.
Excellent addendum. Thanks!\n\nI wasn't really paying attention to the specifics of OPs proposed furnace/boiler.\n\n(I'm going for electric hybrid heat pump for my own DWH now that I just put up some solar panels, and adding a mini-spit to an apartment I own that is currently all electric resistance baseboards, so I'm on board too!)
I'm going to plant a fruit tree that belongs a full USDA zone south of me.  We'll see how it gets on. How many years can I keep it alive? What efforts should I go to to keep it alive, if any? etc....

Normal move here, or Mormon utopian community move here?\n\n(genuinely just curious)
New commercial developments already come with a bunch mandated work.  It's not like the Burlington mall was going to happen without them re-building two streets for the town. \n\nSimilarly, the state has very strict requirements on road side signs.\n\nIt's not like setting up rules for how new development happens is anything new, though you may disagree with this proposed one.
> I may not offer any payment but suggest joint work.\n\nYou want someone to do half the work but you keep all of the ad revenue?
Have you done anything for fertility?\n\nIt doesn't have much requirement since the leaves drop before you harvest, right? Just curious if you did anything for establishment, and if you ever add Nitrogen
Massachusetts is in a good spot to use the new generation of electric heat pumps.....
Not always the case at all.  It really has to do with where the tree's canopy got the most light. Could be the north side if there were other trees on the south......\n\nEdit: Also could have been compacted soil around the roots on the slower growing side.
If the units are comparable, and you already got a ton of interest at the higher rate, isn't that telling you that you've got a fair asking price?\n\nInherited tenant moved out of their own accord? You don't even have to feel guilty for evicting them!
> See if you can borrow a leaf blower and walk around the inside of the house to blow out all the fibers too (wear your respirator and tyvek suit if you have one when doing this).\n\nDon't vacuum, but do use a leaf blower?\n\nSounds a little crazy, doesn't it?
Oh good, I thought I was the only one who only saw Lorde
My point more generally is that the rotten rim joist rotted because it got wet consistently for prolonged periods of time. You can replace it, but you won't want it to rot again....
Which can be tricky for the far right (in groups anyway)\n\nJust try to keep an open mind, and see individuals as individuals /u/TheSourTruth 
That would require a state constitutional re-write.\n\nIt'd probably easier to organize a large voter call-in, mail-in to representatives, senators and the governor's office.  \n\nHonestly, if you get enough GOP state reps to sing on to the deal, Scott will sign it, because he won't want the embarrassment of having his veto over-ruled by the legislature.\n\nSo, you could go your route and re-write the state's constitution over probably a decade of argument, or start some strong social and traditional media campaigns to get Vermonters to express their support for legalization.
> that's peaking now.\n\nMaybe where you live.....  Still buried under snow around here
It's almost like not every situation is the same for everyone!
You mean, like Cow Power?\nhttp://www.eenews.net/stories/1060018678
Typically that would cause the petiole to senesce (die back) and the petiole would abscise and drop off. There may be a minor benefit that the plant will have a chance to make an abscission layer where the petiole drops off that will be more resistant to disease/decay than if you just had an open wound where you cut the petiole away from the rest of the plant.\n\nIt's probably a marginal benefit however, and it's hard to really advise without knowing more. What plant? Why does it need leaf pruning? etc..... 
No way, Doublethink is like twice the ideas, so it's a great thing\n\nDouble plus good
Think of the international energy scene going towards the future.\n\nHow long will you live in the house?  \n\nDo you think Trump will stay in office for the next 8 years holding back international climate change agreements? (I know you're in Canada, it's just that the U.S. tends to help things along or not)\n\nI feel like fossil fuels are only going to get more expensive in the future (because of carbon tax schemes, I think the demand will actually be dropping which will lower base rates).\n\nI also think that Electric gives you the most flexibility.  Your furnace probably won't be around long enough for fusion power to become a reality, but once it does, people are going to use electric for everything. (okay, that's a big if)\n\nWhat are the solar rules like where you live? Can you get a good net metering contract in place?  Even though /u/nathhad made a great argument against solar PV, if you have a bunch of panels cranking out KWH in the summer and you're allowed to offset your usage in the winter, it's not terrible. It may not fully win out over propane (when you amortize the cost of the PV system over the life of the furnace) but it does give you more psychological gains (particularly if you're worried about climate change), and insulates you from the uncertainty of future propane costs.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that propane was getting crazy expensive. It could happen again.
I've never really heard the cons. Care to enlighten me?
I think they're suggesting it means you do move to a new apartment, you just set the tax return money aside in a savings account and draw it down monthly to pay the rent. Every month you take the portion of your paycheck that would normally go to rent and use that to pay down your credit card debt.\n\nYou may want to get some help at /r/personalfinance They can help you make sense of your debts and your budget, and how to put yourself in a stronger position financially over the long term.
Did the plowing fully invert the sod?\n\nOften folks don't get a good flip, and you see the sod growing up again in sort of strips (parallel to the furrow). This can be trickier with small equipment in old, established sod.\n\nOne thing to consider is secondary tillage. Plowing is primary tillage.\n\nDo you have access to a set of discs? (disc harrows) or perhaps a roto-tiller?\n\n**tl;dr** You plowed, but you didn't actually kill the sod, so of course it re-grew. You either need to really bury it well, or get some secondary tillage in to better kill it.
I think their point is that some people mistake softwood for hardwood.  I've seen people call pine boards "hardwood floor" many times
> I'm joking, I know it's not called global warming any more but climate change\n\nThank god you cleared that up! I won't tolerate disinformation
I knew what you meant, but thought it was worth pointing out how the advice could seem contradictory without further explanation.\n\nYes, HEPA needs to be actual HEPA, not just "HEPA"\nHint, if you can afford it, it's not actual HEPA.....
Not to mention that the bill that gets voted on (if it gets out of committee) will likely look very different than the original proposal
Also the heat would dissipate incredibly quickly with such a small thermal mass
I was thinking more about the water that pools on top of the concrete step.  I don't know how much surface water or roof runoff hits there (if any) but whatever does end on top of the top step needs to go somewhere. Ideally it doesn't head back towards the house.\n\n(smaller scale than landscaping scale drainage)
I noticed this the other day, if you're licensed:\n\nhttp://www.dcenergyinnovations.com/careers
As a Vermonter, you're clearly just leaving us out because you've already got an inferiority complex....
It all basically boils down to money. For the most part "more rural" means "poorer".\nThe areas you are looking at are more well to do and have good schools. You'll be fine.
This article is kind of terrible. \n\nsorry.
And we'd be sending the CO2 back to the atmosphere, wouldn't we?
There are some useful links and such on the sidebar of personal finance.\n\nHere are some of my thoughts, take 'em or leave 'em:\n\nFor home ownership, you really shouldn't buy unless you truly plan on living there for 5+ years.  Paying rent does buy you freedom to an extent. That being said, I bought a duplex and have renters help to pay my mortgage.\n\nYou should have an IRA open somewhere, at the least. I chose ROTH over traditional and like to use Vanguard index funds.\n\nI'm not trying to tell you what to do, just give you examples to think about and spur your self-education. If you don't know what anything I just wrote means, go look it up!\n\n
Maybe ensure that the steps aren't draining towards the house as well
> Oh wait, scratch that, it just says 'HELF'
It's okay to not be the one doing the killing.\n\nBut also a rooster you let sit on your shoulder is now a pet, and you're headed towards one of those people who puts diapers on their chickens so they can live inside the house. (seriously, it's a thing, google it).  There's nothing wrong with that I guess, but those are pets and not livestock.\n\nA friend of mine only names her pets, and just refers to her livestock as "mutton" and "bacon" and "veal" etc..... ("come here mutton")\n\nTry to have a plan, which animals are livestock, and which are pets. It's okay to pay someone to do the slaughtering and processing. There's a good chance they're better and faster at it than you anyway, and you can probably observe and learn.\n\nAlso, if you have friends that are also doing meat birds, maybe you can offer to help them on processing day in exchange for more experience. Just be honest and tell them you're not sure you're ready for it.
And just since OP doesn't own a saw yet, I might add that they should very carefully set the depth of the saw blade as they go through that plywood. Better to leave an 1/8" of plywood that needs to be snapped than to cut in to the hardwood underneath.\n\nSecond tip, after a section is free, a shingle shovel can pop up those sections of plywood like nothing (including the nails)
from skimming that article, I would imagine he worked out a payment plan to pay the taxes he owed.
I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I bought with an FHA and my PMI is closer to $200 per month.  Over the years it has cost me a lot of money and made my overall ability to continue paying the mortgage a bit riskier.....
For everyone wondering if it will pass, email/call/write your state legislators and tell them you want it passed. Otherwise they only hear from the anti-legalization side because they're more vocal
You sure you've read those? \n\nThe bike wasn't actually stolen for instance, he forgot that he had left it at a friend's.

I don't think it would be cost-effective to remove previously installed capacity, so I guess it's just a question of how they're making decisions with future installations.

Though it seems like growing a lot of feed, the increase in fresh weight is due \nto water and most often there is a reduction in dry matter weight compared with the initial grain. \n**Hydroponically sprouting grain is less a case of growing feed and more a case of buying in grain \nand spending additional, sizeable quantities of time and money to change its quality and reduce \nits  dry  matter  weight.**  The  economics  and  application  of  such  a  production  system  should  be \ncarefully examined. \nThis report evaluates the economics of producing cereal sprouts for commercial cattle production \nthrough a hydroponic system. It looks at aspects of sprouts dry matter content and nutrient quality \nas well as provides methods of costing and comparing sprouts with other supplements. \n\nAvailable here: http://blogs.cornell.edu/organicdairyinitiative/files/2014/05/Hydroponicfodder-article-11wpnm0.pdf\n\nEdit: From the article in OP\n\n>But if placed in the right environment, seeds are able to germinate; and **in the process, the stored nutrients come to life, multiply and kick into action**.\n\nI'm sorry, what? what nutrients are coming to life, multiplying, and kicking into action?\nCrude protein is literally a measurement of nitrogen in the feed. That won't just magically increase as the seed sprouts. The only way crude protein content is going up is if the sprouted seed is being given nitrogen (like in a hydroponic system, with fertilizer inputs)

I'm fairly certain that the Sec. 9 of the Executive Order (the part that says what is considered a "sanctuary" jurisdiction) makes no sense. It defines a "sanctuary" jurisdiction as a jurisdiction that is in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1373. The problem is that the law prohibits any entity from restricting or stopping any government entity or official from sharing information about the immigration status or individuals with the various agencies that used to be the INS *unless there is a law at the federal, state, or local level that allows for the restriction or prohibition of such information being shared with that apparatus.*\n\n8 U.S.C. 1373:\n>(a) In general\n>Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\n>(b) Additional authority of government entities\n>Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any of the following with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual:\n>>(1) Sending such information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n>>(2) Maintaining such information.\n>>(3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local government entity.\n>(c) Obligation to respond to inquiries\n>The Immigration and Naturalization Service shall respond to an inquiry by a Federal, State, or local government agency, seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose authorized by law, by providing the requested verification or status information.\n\n

They may ask you what you went through, they may ask you for help right then, they may say "thank you" and not ask for helo right then, or they may react in an irritated or indifferent way. No matter how they react, follow up later—check in asking if they need anything. Try not to say "help" because it can make people feel worse—like they're weak and *need* help—and try to use the word "I" or "me" as little as possible, try to use "you"—make it about them.\n\nThat being said, if it the type of experience that you know will be something that they will laugh at in the future, thinking back on a shared past experience where you reacted in a similar way that you both look back on and laugh at could be helpful.\n\nThis all depends on the person you are trying to console and the situation. If it is a major thing that someone is dealing with (e.g. the death of a family member or friend), it is best to make it about them. If it is a trivial thing (e.g. getting a bad grade, fighting with a friend, or saying something embarrassing to their crush), do not try to trivialize their experience or their reaction, but telling them a similar story about an experience you went through and you were able to get past and still succeed can give someone a sense of hope or show them that there's light at the end of the tunnel. If the person greatly respects you, your past experiences will carry weight and your triumph over the obstacle can help.

The bulk was during WWII. There was only one case after the 40's where someone was convicted of treason—Tomoya Kawakita in 1952, but that was a case from WWII. No treason conviction, at least that I can find, that was not as a result of "levying War" occurred in the absence of a formal declaration of war. That's why the Rosenbergs were tried and convicted of espionage and not treason.

Being charged with treason does not mean they were guilty of treason—neither of them were convicted of treason. I should've been more specific: treason in the form of "adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort" can only occur in the presence of a formal declaration of war. In the form of "levying War against [the United States]" can occur at any time, but it requires a group of people in a coordinated effort using physical force against the government. However, as Trump has not gathered a group of people to try and forcibly overthrow the government, I didn't think the "levying War" flavor of treason was particularly relevant to this conversation. \n\nA few sources: \nhttp://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/treason.htm\nhttp://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/law/crime-and-law-enforcement/treason

Even if that were true, it probably wouldn't fall under the extremely narrow definition of treason.

I agree/disagree. I agree that just sharing a worse experience you had is not helpful, but sharing an experience similar to what that person has gone through *and then* offering them support because you've had similar experiences is helpful. In addition, when it comes to embarrassing stories (e.g. saying something embarrassing to their crush), "one-upping" can be helpful if the story has a happy ending because it can give someone hope that if you went through something similar or worse, they can get through it, too. Just the story on its own (i.e. *Person 1: My mom has terminal cancer. Person 2: My mom died of cancer when I was 7.*), though, is not helpful.
I hate to be the pedantic one here, but nothing that Trump or any of his ilk has done is technically treason. Treason can only occur when an American helps a power against which Congress has issued a formal declaration of war. Without a formal declaration of war, treason is legally impossible. Now, what Trump and his minions have done is absolutely wrong and in most cases (probably) illegal and in serious violation of the law, but, technically, it is not treason.

Not exactly, something like 8 or 10% of federal highway funding to a state is withheld if a state's laws with regards to drinking age and legal limits for drunk driving does not meet the standards set forth in the law. That was part of a law passed by Congress—the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. As far as I know, there is no law that explicitly ties federal funding of any kind to a locality's policy regarding how they deal with people in violation of immigration law. However, if the funding comes an executive department or agency, such as HUD Community Development Block Grants, could probably be denied to cities that meet/fail to meet whatever requirements Trump sets forth via an Executive Order.

Yes you are completely right about this. We're targeting people that have no convictions and then anyone else that gets killed in the process is like "oh well, this is war." And we do all this in the name of keeping our country "safe." Yet even if these tactics were keeping us safe (which I would argue they are not due to the new enemies we create every time this happens) we are really losing the very thing about our country that is worth protecting. We either believe in our principles or we don't. And right now we as a country have let our fear steal that from us.
As a female progressive I'm happy to see this many women mobilizing for change, but I think the marches today encompass so much more than just women's rights. This is the liberal backlash to the insane Trump presidency. 
Ok, so I used to be an OCD face washer. Washing more does not equal clear skin. I should also preface this with, I'm a girl so I wear make-up as well. My skin used to be really oily and I would get a fair amount of break outs. My skin has cleared a lot after I stopped wearing foundation (you can substitute w/ a mineral powder), only wash at night to clean off make-up, and use coconut oil as an all natural moisturizer. The coconut oil is especially awesome because it has anti-bacterial affects so it's also helping keep your skin clear as adds moisture. I put it on every night before bed.

I'm not saying don't learn multiple skills but know which one is your focus. You don't want to aim for good, you want to be brilliant. Know everything you can about that one thing. Surround yourself with people who are better than you and figure out how they got there. And if you're really serious be ready to move to NY or L.A.

My thoughts exactly. As soon as he said that I had a "palm to face" moment. Still? You're still sticking to that logic? It's like when a kid thinks they can just deny their way out of getting in trouble. Except it's a member of our congress... 
Couldn't agree more on this. I think we need to hold Dems accountable and let them know we are paying attention. This isn't about right vs left. This is about citizens vs corrupt politicians on both sides of the aisle. I'd bet Corey Booker will have some pause next time he wants to vote against what's best for the people. 
Dan Savage talks about how horrible our sex registry system is. Knowing someone is on the registry basically doesn't tell us anything because it gets abused in situations like this. He specifically mentions cases like yours where the parents seek retribution on the other party out of anger even though you weren't aware you were committing a crime. There should be a lot more nuance to the system so that you aren't receiving the same punishment as a child molester. It's insane. Hang in there and when you can, definitely go see a psychologist to help cope. Honestly sharing your story is important and it gives a voice to this problem so thank you for that.
You don't have to vote for either if Jill Stein is on your ballot. Vote Green instead.
You broke him
Career politician vs. reality tv star who brags about sexual assault? This is not complex. 
Just voted yesterday. Live in Palmetto. It was super fast. The only question is for the dem nomination. You are in and out in five minutes. And you can go to any participating location.
^^^ this guy has nothing better to do than comment anti Bernie stuff in SFP subreddit. I genuinely hope your life gets more interesting buddy.
Commenting so I can come back to this :)
Roe vs Wade has been getting undermined in a lot of southern states since the tea party took over. In many states the clinics have been shut down because of new laws implemented specifically to force them to close. Women are being forced to have unnecessary and invasive procedures in order to dissuade them from having an abortion. The right wants to defund Planned Parenthood, one of the primary centers for women's health that serves low access communities. This is all happened before we got a President that likes to brag about assaulting women. So? You get it now? edit: punctuation
We don't do a lot of dates because we're both so busy and money is tight. But we cook together every night, grocery shop together, and watch our favorite shows together every week. Finding pleasure in the mundane is important. 
Beast master-> umm, beast master...
Actually when people tell you who they are, we should believe them. Trump assaults women, denies climate change, and puts people in cabinet positions that don't know what the fuck they're doing and often just want to dismantle the very agency they're in charge of. I choose act now. You can wait till it gets worse if you want. 
What a great outline of the parallels to her attacks. Sanders could easily use this his advantage in pointing out that all these arguments have been made before... except they were against President Obama.
Life lesson: you're a dick.
This is an important point. We can't pay too much attention to these polls, especially if it is going to lower morale. The way polls are conducted are always going to favor the establishment candidate. You can't poll the once apathetic voter or the newly invigorated voter who has never voted in a primary. These people are hiding in the woodwork. They have to focus on likely primary voters. Sanders' key ingredient is excitement. That's what is going to bring people out for the first time or change the minds of the undecided. We can't let these polls dampen that excitement. It's an easy trap to fall into since a lot of us are recovering cynics of the whole political machine and numbers feel like this nice unbiased meter to rate our success. But the truth is this isn't your typical campaign and we can't gauge it the same way. \nI just met a Georgia group that has been tabling on GSU campus. In Georgia you can show your support for a candidate while registering people to vote and they have been running out of voter registration sheets at the Panther's for Bernie table. You can bet these guys aren't going to get called for polling. Keep your enthusiasm up! This is our race to lose, not Hillary's. \n\n
Excusing your behavior with a "I'm a terrible person" doesn't mean shit. If you're aware that you're a terrible person then change. That's completely within your control. And stop "teaching life lessons." Teaching is obviously not your forte. 
I'd like to know how this poll was conducted. I'm in Georgia near the Atlanta area and highly doubt this is accurate. Also as a side note, our university groups have been hitting it hard for months on voter registration. And GA has record voter registration this year. Those people aren't going to be included in polling. Hopefully they will turn out to vote. Atlanta HQ's has been very active as well.
I was also thinking that a March in response to this Muslim ban would be important to send a message that we stand with our immigrants. I know a lot of spontaneous rallies happened at the airports but since it looks like this is going to be an on-going problem it might be a good march to push forward. I also think silent marches can be very powerful. But I'm on board with any march that you guys feel strongly about! 
You can get a professional acting coach via skype these days. Worth looking into.
Just wondering, are you still friends with any of the students you befriended at Liberty and what did they think of Unlikely Disciple? Also, looking forward to reading your new book! 
Also voted in GA yesterday. Early voting is open everyday now till March 1st and you can go to an location to cast your vote.
You're getting primaried, and you're getting primaried, and you're getting primaried!
Another thing we can do....\n\nWhen I moved to Florida in 2008, on election day a democrat volunteer came to my door and asked if I had voted yet and offered to give me a ride. I'm from Tennessee so I'd never seen anything like that. 
They are referring to the exit polls,  not general polls conducted prior to voting day. Exit polls should be pretty close to the results because they are polling people after they leave the voting site. 
Thanks for this. I know why it's important to know that they were citizens for the abuse of due process, but I hope America will see that "collateral damage" is always horrific. When I read these stories it's really easy for me to ask "which side is the terrorist?" 
Get ready, here comes the big pep talk!\n\nGET BACK IN CLASS. Don't wait, just do it. Some teachers don't have the right teaching style to bring out your genius which you WILL uncover. I consider myself a pretty confident actor these days, but I've been in classes where I noticed the dynamic didn't lend to taking risks and gaining confidence. It became about needing that approval. If that's how your teacher is making you feel, it's not the right fit and you need to switch classes. Class needs to be a safe place to make mistakes. You should feel like you're gaining confidence, not losing it. Confidence leads to better performing leads to better confidence. That needs to be the trajectory. But I'm also just going to put this out there. What if you just did it because it makes you happy? What if you didn't give two shits about where this leads, but you still did it any way? Judging and expectations kills the artist heart. Find the right teacher, soak up their wisdom, and have a blast digging deep into the work. But PLEASE do not live the rest of your life wishing you had. 
There's a show called my 600 pound life on TLC. Might be a something to watch with him. Just make sure that he knows his value as a person is not based on his weight and make it completely health based. This is simply about feeling better and living longer.
First I want to say I am sorry. Society has let you down. The deck is stacked and it's not your and your husband's fault. Thank you for sharing your story. We need people to be talking about this and having these conversations. I shared your story on my facebook page because it speaks so clearly to where we're failing in our society. 
Been meditating for a few months now. When I was establishing the habit, I succeeded by making it the first thing I do everyday. I recommend doing this at first to get started.
Yeah, I'm from TN. My fb news feed is all about God and guns. Cause WWJD, right?
Count me in!
Jumping in here. I was in Atlanta for a year and I know the guys at Frat pack. You can find them on facebook. They are a great network of working actors that can really help you out. I recommend attending Rowan Bousaid's class.  A big part of class is also just finding your tribe that you click with. Kudos on having the guts to live your authentic life. If there's any nugget of advice that I could give you on this journey is just to remember why you started. Later on when you're going out for roles it can be easy to fall in the trap of tying your self worth to if you're booking, how much you're booking, etc. Booking a role will never mean you are good or bad. Stay in class and stay focused on the work. 
Thanks for this. I've got Alan Grayson. I'm good. 
I'm not sure if this would work in there but is there a place in the monologue where you could unexpectedly scream at them. I think it would be really eery and cool to play with that. I like how scary he is just being calm but it may add a level in there. It's great how it is though! This is definitely good casting for you. You're a good psycho lol.
That's kinda what I'm talking about. I think *some* leaders are perking their ears and have opened themselves up to some lesson-learning. That doesn't mean their politics will magically transform but I hope it's a sign that they're willing to pivot a bit to embrace certain elements of the progressive bloc.
If you truly believe the decision to close SFP wasn't talked about at great length beforehand, then there's no point in having this conversation. \n\nThey asked if it was shut down. I told them it was. Feel free to read into it as deeply as you like, but you're wasting time that would be better spent campaigning for progressives up and down the ballot. 
Not to mention the back-to-back-to-back winner of "Best Brewery in the World" award, Hill Farmstead. \n\nShit. I've said too much. DID YOU KNOW IT WAS -20 THE OTHER DAY? YEAH THIS PLACE IS AWFUL. 
I remember that rule. That's because your body isn't long enough. It's to prevent people from submitting posts that just have something in the title but nothing substantial in the actual meat of the post. \n\nI think SFP got rid of that rule. Maybe TPR should also. But try posting with more words in the body until they change it! 
Yeah I have -42 for you. Weird.
1 month later. How are you enjoying the game?
>We're talking about West Virginia specifically. You're better than this.\n\nI mean, you *definitely* didn't specify. Pretty honest mistake.\n\nAnyways. Good talk. While I generally agree that the purity test of the left is stupid, Joe Manchin is one of the rare exceptions. 
mods = gods
Shit, why bother listening to Jimmy Dore when you can hear it [straight from one of Bernie's fundraisers himself?](https://twitter.com/ttagaris/status/828617284709150720)\n\nPS - [Another fundraiser chimes in](https://twitter.com/michaelwhitney/status/828613234781540352)\n\nPPS - I worked with all these people. *Everyone* on the team feels this way, and any digital fundraisers worth their salt will say the same exact thing.\n\nEDIT: All that being said, stop reading Washington Times. This whole list thing is overblown. It's dumb to expect someone to *give over their entire list,* but if the DNC is willing to embrace progressivism, I'm 100% positive that Bernie and other progressive leaders would be willing to *use their own lists* to benefit the DNC and down-ballot dems. \n\n
Interesting to hear about your inverse experience! I miss Vermont with a fiery passion that could melt the caps of Mount Mansfield. It's damn WRONG that I can walk outside in just a long-sleeve shirt in the middle of February! \n\n>It was surprisingly easy for me to find a job in Burlington.\n\nThis doesn't surprise me, but I know many who are far less fortunate. It's not like I couldn't find a job *in general.* But one of the underlying problems here is that in my personal situation, I was forced to look out-of-state in order to find a *stable* job in my industry that paid a competitive salary on-par with my experience and expertise. Vermont couldn't offer that, no matter where I looked. 
No never.  \n\nEDIT: I'm really surprised so many of y'all took this seriously and also surprised I never got that pm. I even sent one to you, dude! 
That's the purpose of burying it in a friday news dump. It's a miracle anyone heard about this all. 
Savage.
>If you successfully primary him, the Republicans will take that seat.\n\nI don't really think that's how electorates go. Isn't the #1 rebuttal to the "Bernie would have won" crowd that Clinton won the primary? If you get more votes in the primary, it's *usually* logical to assume that you'll fare better in the general.\n\n>Primarying Manchin isn't about his constituents. It's about purity tests\n\nManchin is a shitty excuse for a democrat. If he can be beat by a Democrat in the primary, there's no reason to assume that same Democrat can't beat Morrisey.\n\n
Looks like the corrupted demon from Princess Mononoke. 
Bernie's campaign could not have been as successful as it was without petitions. TYT wouldn't be successful without petitions.\n\nPetitions serve three purposes:\n\n1) To raise viral awareness about an issue.  \n2) To rally a group around a common-issue and show mass solidarity.  \n3) To build an email list that can later be called upon for volunteer efforts, donations, demonstrations, etc.\n\nDon't downplay their significance. Sure, the DCCC is awful, and a lot of groups just spam petitions and donation-asks and never put it to good use. But in general, they're incredibly valuable. The popular "edgy" opinion is that petitions are stupid and pointless but only people outside of the industry feel that way, in my experience. 
GOP just turned the Senate floor into a safe space. 
/u/writingtoss: this guy is karma farming your subreddit using low effort tweets that I -- a certifiable idiot  -- used to write for the Senator. \n\nPlease stop this. 
Authentic digital and #NeverTweet? You sure know how to win me over.\n\nFor sure. I'm in DC full time. Lunch is on me!
Yeah, UMaine was way *less* expensive when I was college-shopping. Ended up going to UNH instead. \n\nMoved back to Vermont after graduating, picked up a low/middle salary job and tried to make it work for as long as I could, but that only lasted 3.5 years. Now I'm in DC. \n\nThere was virtually zero reasonable job availability for someone in my field. Moved to DC and found a career-changing opportunity within a weekend. \n\nThis is a big issue :/
Two things. \n\n1) Why the hell are we upvoting garbage from Jared Kushner's website? \n\n2) Bernie has been blaming the establishment all along. Stop promoting clickbait. \n\n
>It wasn't dominating in the second half. Their run game was getting stuffed.\n\nBingo. 10 total run plays in the 2nd half. Only 28 yards (4 of those 10 runs were for a loss, in fact). \n\nBelichick made adjustments and shut down the run in the 2nd half. That, coupled with injuries to the Falcons O-Line...really all there is to it.
Hired trained professionals to build a website and digital infrastructure to then hand over to the grassroots.... \n\nThat's exactly how this is supposed to work.  Ideally, every ordinary activist would have the experience, skills, and knowledge necessary to scale up a massive nation wide campaign but that is not the case. 
RIP HIS GODDAMN WEAVE OUT, DAD \n\nOh..... Wait. \n\n\\*sobs* 
Competition is a good thing. Keeps candidates honest, and encourages them to improve their positions to suit the needs of their constituents. 
Don't care about the retweets. Just stuck on mobile and needed a way to convey the urgency if the situation without being limited by title guidelines.

I once heard that I *single-handedly* destroyed the "biggest progressive movement in history." This person made that comment a few hours after the historic Women's March, for context (not to mention the total ignorance of history in general, and a complete over-evaluation of how significant Reddit is). Now, apparently, I'm the cause of significant medical-trauma. Next it'll be the Bubonic Plague. \n\nThe same story has taken many shapes since July. Folks just really like their outlandish hyperbole, I guess. 
Hey - you do realize that the Basileus is just restoring the *EASTERN* Roman Empire, and not the full Roman Empire at the peak of it's might, right? You basically just need all your original cores, plus all of Anatolia, two provinces up near Theodoro, and Cyprus. \n\nAlso: Good luck on the last-minute run. Around 1700 in my game, I got a PU over France *AND* Poland....still wasn't enough to get Mare Nostrum. Spain had eaten portugal, most of italy, and all of North + West Africa, and super Sweden and super Russia were allied to Spain. Ended up hitting 1821 with all of the necessary cores except *all of Iberia.*
Interesting. I have about 3 dummy emails that I use to track digital programs nowadays, and I think the only emails I got that I didn't manually go to their website and sign up for were Zuckerman (donated to him) and Jane Kim. \n\nGenerally, I opt for the "you must have filled out something at some point by accident" line of reasoning. Not sure what else to say. \n\nSidenote - Can I count on your vote in 2034? I want to be the one that breaks /u/Eternally65's tradition. \n\nSide-side note: I knew Minter was going to struggle and personally hated her insistence on putting gun control at the top of the list. Not just from a personal standpoint but from a strategic standpoint. Not a big fan of Scott but he's been pleasantly okay so far. Haven't paid enough attention but I like what I'm seeing more than ol' Shlumlin.
Yes.
........
[Yeah, he's addressed that too.](http://time.com/4025262/tom-brady-trump-hat/)\n\nIt was a gift from a friend who was running a presidential campaign. The gift made it's way to Brady's locker (usually managed by players, other personnel, managers, or equipment staff). That doesn't necessarily mean that Brady put it there himself. Nor does it mean Brady agrees with Trump's politics or voted for him (like I stated above).
This isn't true -- unless you believe Trump more than Gisele. \n\nBrady is *friends* with Trump. His wife has gone on record saying they didn't vote for him. And Brady has gone on record saying, "just because you're friends with someone doesn't mean you like their politics." \n\n
/u/writingtoss: this guy is karma farming your subreddit using low effort tweets that I -- a certifiable idiot  -- used to write. \n\nPlease stop this. 
Thanks for the update and thanks for trying to put in the work to push this legislation. \n\nBummed that we couldn't beat the rest of New England to legalization, and I hope we see it pass this time 'round. \n\nIIRC, Phil Scott has said he'll sign a legalization bill into law if it reaches his desk. Don't think Shumlin said the same thing.
Can someone explain to me who Sam Ronan is and what he's done that makes him qualified to run the Democratic Party in arguably one of the most important 4 years of the party's modern history?\n\nDoes he have *ANY* political experience? Any experience as a campaigner, or organizer, or negotiator, or strategist? Because the Democratic Party absolutely cannot afford to choose another round of ineffective leadership.
I'm conflicted. They gave the Falcons "Tweezer Reprise" for their intro video music. That's my #1 hype song ever. \n\nSOILED IT. SOILED IT. SOILED IT. 
>I can't speak for you and I don't if you can relate to this but it definitely hurts when your alleged "friends" believe your a second class citizen\n\nI agree. *Those* "friends" of mine are no longer friends. But when I ask all of the Trump supporters in my current circle about this, they assure me they hate that stance of his. \n\nIt's a really weird situation. Lots of party loyalty, lots of ignorance, and lots of selectiveness when it comes to why people support certain candidates. 
>It's pretty obvious to anyone paying attention that you shut this place down as a way of stopping all Clinton/DNC criticism\n\n-\n>We get it, you don't see us as people, you just see us as a tool to advance yourself.\n\n\n[You brought a lot of evidence to back up these claims so I see no use in arguing that point with you.](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-40503-Supernatural-Dean-Speechless-W-JVWN.gif)\n\nJust pointing it out that there are way more candidates in need than just Arturo. **And they are being neglected, just like the down-ballot candidates were neglected after Bernie lost NY.** I'm gonna go make sure their campaigns have money and volunteers. You stay here and enjoy the Bernie tweets. \n
Hate to break your heart like this, kid....
Well said.
That's not how ActBlue works, actually. You might have gotten caught up in a different list-swap from a different candidate or org.\n\nSource: Am professional fundraiser. 
Found Marshall Faulk's alt.\n\nEDIT: /u/DICKVERSACE please do yourself a favor and read the Wells Report. *Yes, the actual series of legal documents -- not some analysis on Fox Sports.* You'll be surprised at how the actual report doesn't fit with your preconceived narrative about asterisks and cheating and what not. 
Are you *really* suggesting that Star Wars got it wrong and science got it right? Preposterous. 
Ah! I missed the "*and get it*" part of that Wallachia sentence. My mistake! 
Vermonter here! Yep. Massachusetts is the greatest. I frankly hate Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire. Uninhabitable wasteland filled with gun loving rednecks yessir. Really just keep driving. Nothing to see here. 
I don't think so. Arturo's bio online says he's the son of immigrants. Richard Carmona's bio says he was born in NYC.\n\nGlad you're asking the tough, important questions though! 
More craven then Goodell. 
Go to war against other daimyos! Great way to make money AND take land at the same time. \n\nJapan is one of my favorite runs to do. Just be sure that you stop conquering land once you get to 10 provinces, otherwise the Shogunate will declare on you.\n\nMy general strategy for that is to take all of Japan that sits below Hosokawa's capital, and then declare on the other daimyos one by one. You can fully siege them without making peace (thus ensuring Japan won't declare on you). \n\nOnce you've recovered your manpower and gold and built up a force that'll wipe out Japan (make sure you let them take on your rebels to weaken their armies) then just sue for peace in all your wars, take as much of the land as humanly possible, then immediately DOW on the Shogunate. They won't be able to call in any allies since you just finished eating them all, and hopefully their army will have been weakened for protecting your lands from rebels.
Lawson's Super Session IPA (for all day crushability). Heady Topper for kickoff once it's time to get aggressive. Same combo I used for SB 49.\n\nRum and bourbon as emergency drinks.... Only to be opened for epic celebration or epic despair.  
What? I never karma farmed them or spammed SFP with them though. That's the difference. I know better than anyone here the kind of value Bernie's tweets have.\n\nBut considering the fact that the #1 complaint when SFP shut down was about how the decision was "ruining activism," it's a little strange to see zero activism on the top 3 pages, while plain old tweets take up 20 spots.  
Sail on Solons, brother.
Yep. Only those three 😏

Wanna know the worst part? The DCCC performs *insanely* well, even if it means sucking the well dry. \n\nThey don't care. It's reckless gluttony, but they get to *POST RECORD PROFITS! TRIPLE MATCH NOW!*\n\nThe whole system is a scam. Those $&*$&**ers even launch email campaigns that try to trick elderly supporters into thinking they need to "pay their annual Democratic dues" or else they won't be a part of the party anymore. \n\nYou'd be hard pressed finding anything more scummy in the digital-left than the DCCC. 
I mean I literally wrote "our man's tweets" for 8 months, but okay. 
I think we tried that once and it flopped. Surely it'll be different this time! 
ITT: some really amazing prescriptions for rose colored glasses.
Japan. They're in a very unique position to be both a domineering force throughout Manchu + China, while also colonizing the spice islands, Australia, and California. Plus they get unique events, a unique government, and it's only gonna get better with this new patch.\n\nRunner up is Holland > Netherlands. Then I'd rank Teutonic Order > Prussia and Byzantium > Blurple Kebab as the next up. With Ethiopia, Nepal, Sweden, and Florence bringing up the rear. \n\n
Nah, Our Revolution would function in mostly the same way as Bernie's list was operating (they're basically the same list). \n\nObviously can't say for sure without knowing *who* you got emails from but my guess would still be that you acted upon any of the large number of Bernie or OurRev emails that were centered around supporting candidates like Zephyr, Jane Kim, Feingold, Pramila, etc. 
Born and raised in Montpelier -- it's more than one person! \n\n...But I've said too much. Gotta kill you now.

[It's not like they're hiding anything, dude.](http://i.imgur.com/V9jUEA0.png)\n\nPS - If you think Trump writes all of his tweets, you're in for another big surprise. He only writes the *realllllly* dumb ones at 3 am on the toilet.
Sick burn.
Right. But even that's not good enough for some people.\n\nIt's such a frustrating bout of perfectionism. Is there really anyone here who can honestly say that they don't have friends whom they disagree with ideologically? I grew up in Vermont -- i've got plenty of "woodchuck" friends from my childhood and high school years. \n\nYes, they voted for Trump. Yes, we argue about politics. Yes, it pisses me off. But they're still my best friends. Nobody is perfect, and I can't blame them for holding a different opinion than me. They probably "hate" that I'm a socialist, but that doesn't stop us from catching up and getting some beers whenever I visit home.
I been here the whole time. 
>A large percentage of yours \n\nI'd love to see some math to back this up. Calling bollocks until then.\n\n>I'm not the one saying it's a bad thing, you are.\n\nI'm sorry if I haven't made this clear but lemme quickly repeat it: **"I never karma farmed them or spammed SFP with them though. That's the difference."** <-- That's what I'm saying. Comparing my posting history to /u/SteveSmith2020's is fallacious. Thanks to him, our front pages are filled with twenty submissions from the same user, on the same day, linking to the same Senator's tweets, *and that's a bad thing.* That's karma farming. That's spam. There's nothing substantial about it, and it should stop. There are candidates who could use our help.\n\n>Want to know why this place isn't as alive?\n\nMy complaints about the lack of activism extend to way way way way way before the campaign ended. You might not have noticed, but anyone who has been here from the start (and campaign staffers, too) will tell you the same thing: *real activism on SFP fell by the wayside as the campaign progressed.*\n\nAlas. That isn't really relevant. Yes, the subreddit was shuttered for a medley of reasons. No, David Brock was not one of those reasons (contrary to conspiratorial belief). But here's the thing:\n\nSo much of the SFP-closing outrage stemmed from a perceived loss of potential activism. It was the #1 complaint I saw. But most folks weren't even using the subreddit for activism back then! And now that it's re-opened, most folks *still* aren't using it for activism. \n\nAnd it's not for a lack of trying. There are a few people who repeatedly post call to actions, but those CTAs just get buried by -- you guessed it -- Bernie tweets.\n\nSo - my question to you and the greater community is: why do we ***REPEATEDLY*** find ourselves prioritizing memes, clickbait headlines, and tweets over actual work? Why do real calls to action get downvoted into irrelevancy while the same cookie-cutter tweet gets 14k upvotes? **And most importantly:** which type of post is more helpful to Bernie's revolution? His staffer-written tweet about healthcare that we've all seen 100 times, or a phonebank ask to support a progressive in California whose election is in 2 months?\n\nI believe the second one is the obvious and only correct answer here, and I'd like to see the community as a whole maybe be more aware of their tendencies to upvote substance-less memes and downvote actual activism. 
Hey Melissa! How've you been?\n\nWhat do you think are the biggest TWO lessons you learned on Bernie's campaign, and how do you plan on applying those lessons if elected as Vice Chair?
>39% of Sanders voters planned on voting for Trump in the general.\n\nCitations please! [I've got mine.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/25/the-democratic-convention-is-chaotic-the-democratic-base-isnt/) It says you're full of it.
A lot of people don't seem to understand that this is an early adoption feature. It's like getting the first Windows Operating System ever made. There's enough content for consumers to start trying it out and with more people using it, there will be a bigger push for development (especially with new money backing it from the high cost of content). \nOpen your minds people. 
I think the S7 has fast wireless charging - the S6 has slow wireless charging. 
Just what the game was missing, a Tracer skin.
Yup. But you gotta keep in mind that like 75% of the country wanted the Pats to lose last weekend. Folks just like to stoke the "Pats are evil" flames as much as possible. This is one instance of that. DeflateGate is another -- they don't really care about legal documents, scientific evidence, or retracted testimonies. *"Tom Brady is evil and the only reaosn he's been able to kick my team's ass for over a decade straight is cause he cheats!"* But that's a convo for another time. \n\nAnyways. Who knows who they voted for. Bill wished Trump the best of luck in his endeavors, but has *also* gone on record saying, "just because you're friends with someone doesn't mean you like their politics." Not really sure about Bobby. You could check and see if he donated any money to any particular campaign, perhaps?\n\nI'm most willing to give Kraft a pass since he comes from the same "old rich white dude" echelon that he and Trump have been romping about in for 40 years. Still doesn't make me happy but I also have no real proof that he voted for or supported Trump.\n\nThe problem (blessing?) with the Patriots is that they take their privacy very seriously -- even if it means they could solve a controversy by speaking out. *They only talk about football.* \n\nThis was on full display during Super Bowl week. Someone leaked a rumor that Tom's mom had cancer, and it was why she was ill for 18 months and hadn't attended a game all season. *Every time* someone asked about her, Tom deflected. Not because there's some big secret to keep, but because himself, Bill, and the Patriots organization just want to do all that they can to tune out distractions and focus on football. 
Oh - I don't *like it.* It bothers me as a lifelong Patriots fan. But what I'm saying is that it just stings less than if Bill or Tom voted for him, because I already expected it. 
No, they want it because it's the most powerful list in politics today. "Ditching" Bernie and Ellison would be political suicide and I think they've truly learned that lesson.\n\nThe obvious solution here is for the Party to embrace the progressive wing, and for Bernie to fundraise for progressive Democrats up and down the ballot. \n\n
Wait. They're REMOVED? Hmmm. That doesn't sound right at all. I can understand if the post fizzles out.... Folks like clickbait more than activism after all. 
That's a perfectly fair point, but I don't think it's necessarily fair to characterize emigrants as simply "not understanding Vermont the right way." \n\nI was born and raised in Vermont. It's my dream state and fully plan on settling back down here, but I spent a year job searching and not a single opportunity emerged. It took one weekend in DC to land a dream job in the same industry. Granted, this is an anecdotal thing, and everyone has different experiences with it, but worth noting.\n\nAnd to add to that, my apartment in DC is 2x the size of any of my three VT apartments I've had over the years, but is also less expensive (and no, I'm not living way outside the beltway. Beautiful neighborhood on Capitoll Hill). \n\nI 100 percent intend on moving back to Vermont down the road, as my current career will allow for remote work soon. But the sad reality is that as a college grad with 20k in student debt, working for 30k a year was going to be a massive burden on my life that'd last for a decade at the very least. Moving south was my only real shot at getting a rock solid footing in the short term.

> Just think about any change (progressive or otherwise) that has happened because of petitions....\n\nI was mostly replying to this point. Interpreted it as you saying no "change" has happened because of petitions. My point is that maybe they don't provide a super direct, inherent change in and of themselves, but they certain help *enable* change via voter/supporter contact.
Only if you *donated* to those candidates or signed their joint petitions. That's one method of list-swapping. \n\n

You said:\n\n>If you successfully primary him, the Republicans will take that seat.\n\nI'm telling you that this is counter-intuitive. In most cases, whomever gets the most votes in a primary will perform the best in the general. If we can *successfully* primary Manchin and win the primary against him, it means whoever that winner is has a damn good shot at beating Morrisey. 
Your abundance of sympathy is quite charming. 
>Why would you list a real email address on a petition?\n\nBecause you want to hear more about the efforts and help out when they call for donations and volunteers...
Hard to say, but if I were a betting man, I'd be willing to put down a small amount of chips on Ellison.

>My worry is that the growth required to have the same kinds of jobs you find in DC is directly at odds with the quality of life here that makes it an appealing place to live in in the first place.\n\nCertainly. But I suppose the idea is there's gotta be some middle ground. I don't think you'll find many Vermonters calling for urban sprawl and mass-development, but the current situation is still a big issue for a lot of folks. \n\nAnd it's not just millennials! My mother and her boyfriend recently moved to upstate New York because of the disproportionate cost of living / employment options in Vermont. Granted, New York isn't exactly an oasis of job prospects, but the cost of living is lower in the sticks of NY than it is in most areas of Vermont.\n\n> I don't know your particular situation but I know there are opportunities in Vermont and they just don't look the same, maybe it's a job, maybe it's cheap land, maybe it's building a yurt and renting it out on AirBNB, maybe it's unconventional living arrangements (free rent for work). These you will not find in DC and I suspect go largely under the radar of a person looking for a first job.\n\nThis is a really good point! My gut tells me that Vermont probably has the highest number of these "alternative" income-sources per capita (no facts to back that up but it just *feels* that way, y'know?)\n\nIt's actually been on my radar before, but then I always ran into the obstacle of risk vs reward. When you're already $20k in the red, it's difficult to overcome with the prospect of taking a risk like that. Though that's just my specific experience -- it's always something I want to come back to at some point. Owning a business is a ton of work and I don't know how much I like the idea of maintaining this into my 50s and 60s, regardless of whether I live in DC or Vermont...Then again, I'm only 25. Plenty of time to sort this out.\n\n>Vermont is where our dreams are coming true, as a result I tend to be quite protective of the state's current culture & circumstances as they allow us to thrive.\n\nTotally sympathize, and I feel the same way. I just gotta imagine there's a way to provide well-paying, traditional jobs (minimum wage vs cost of living is BRUTAL in Vermont) while simultaneously holding onto the cultural/societal elements of the state that we all know and love.\n\nBut -- end of the day -- I'm in politics. Not economics. Just an armchair commentator. 
I agree. Though 'Hurt for awhile' is a really mellow way to describe 'melted to death in agonizing pain.'

Private colleges exist->want to make more profit->federal government subsidizes cost with Pel Grant and other funds->government makes college loans un-bankruptable (yes I made that word up)->college kid wants a chance of a better life and to improve themselves, so takes out large loans->student gets into debt and can barely pay->government steps in and tries to help student pay off loans by buying the loan or regulating lower interest rates->college kid is still in crushing debt. \n\nTLDR: This situation is government created, government has to fix it.  This situation is big bank welfare. Big banks are guaranteed that college loan whether the student pays for it or the government trying to help the student; they're essentially loan sharks (in a manner). \n\nCorporate banks win big, government loses some, the middle class loses it all.

I think that Sanders will be a "worse" president in their view than president Obama, but they don't seem to tare down Sanders and instead focus on Hillary. Good for us Bernie Sanders supporters. Maybe they think that they can easily beat a "socialist".

I've been wondering this too. I recently entered the office work environment with a regular 5 day schedule. I swear that 5 days a week is too much for anyone. People need a third day off to get stuff done; two days is nothing. It takes so much time to get ready for work and commute each day - so I wonder if working 10 hours for 4 days is more efficient and if it would help reduce traffic.

We really do need a peaceful revolution, but I'm doubtful one will be sparked for quite a long time.

I'm aware of this.  I would like to see it stand up to the Supreme Court.  As a nation we have relationships with other nations.  If we have a problem with said nation we have a congressional mechanism to declare war with them.  The idea that we violate the sovereignty of another nation and do damage to its people and property without a declaration of war upon that nation isn't acceptable.  I believe your described authorization does not supersede.

Yes, I thought I and two friends had invented cross-multiplication in 4th grade.  The assignment was given with only a few minutes left in class and we were told to expect to take the assignment home to finish it.  We had pairs of fractions and needed to figure out which one of each pair was closer to whole. After a minute of looking at it I came up with the theory of cross-multiplication which we tested on a few sample questions to verify. Once confident we implemented it across the assignment.  We got done with the assignment wayyyyy before anyone else.  My teacher made us go back and show our work but even still we were done quickly as we were working backwards from the right answer.  That was the last time I felt smart.

Leasing public lands doesn't bother me.  I live in NV where mining is very important.  Over the last several years land reclamation has not gone well.  Mines will happily continue to employ a single person forever so that the mine remains "open" because it is cheaper than the clean-up costs.  Try that on public lands and now there is a higher authority that can be called upon to react and remedy the situation.
Well?
This has nothing to do with courtesy.  The MSM had an agenda through the primaries and the general.  When plan A failed, plan B was to find another way to keep eyeballs on their advertisers.  Since Trump is a buffet of Dunning Kruger, and the media has no financial incentives to be nice to him, he's the (well-deserving) mark.\n\nI don't take this as a change of heart for the MSM.  I don't trust them to be reformed 4th Estates who will hitherto be the sanitizing light.  They're still opportunists to me.  Maybe one day they'll regain my faith but not today.
How does that jive with the "Vacuum of space"?  
I'm inclined to agree.  I'm not even completely up my own ass about "Deep State".  There are millions of Americans working for the government who were there when Donny Tiny Hands got in and they'll be there when he's gone.  The intricate machinations between State and the rest of the universe undoubtedly need a more entrenched structure and tenured servants than  a 4-year rotation.\n\nSure, anything can be co-opted and turned to the dark side.  Those examples should be dealt with - you know, like with whistle blowers for example.  The rest are there keeping the wheels turning (I hope).
I feel the opposite.  Whatever gets attention is in our favor.  We already have the message and the man to present it.  All he needs is airtime irrespective of all else.

We force the opposition to confront their demons directly and without equivocation.  The Republican cast of responsible characters will see the crowd's reactions to what I hope to be an honest line of questioning and have no choice but to change course or accept whatever measure We the People decide is appropriate to deliver.

That seems like a convenience distinction.

"Install democracy" is well-understood to mean, "Access to hydrocarbon extraction".  America has toppled democratically elected leaders and installed dictators to that end.  But regardless of motives, we have Russia invading one country and America invading (with people and/or drone strikes) seven nations.  Both countries are doing it for selfish reasons and doing so despite the wishes of the resource-extract-ees.  Different tactics, yes, but I still don't see a distinction.

Secretary of education. I hope.
I do understand this argument but I reject it.  A nation, where extremists are living, is responsible for dealing with said extremists. As we expect a nation to address all its internal concerns.
Isn't this basically the same approach used on Limbaugh?
...and damn the forces that imposed this upon him.  He might as well have been asked to write a banking program by cobbling together Code Red, NIMDA, SIRCAM, KLEZ, Stuxnet, a few side-channel attacks and IE6.
The EFF, along with Adam Carrolla, are the reason you don't see patent trolls in Tyler Texas suing podcasters. Just one of their many successful efforts.

I hear ya, but even your cautious assessment is, IMO, better than the 0.1% getting to quietly keep on making the decision.  We're already at 10 times the representative voice and drawn from a population that samples more closely to my station in life.
Should be a movie IMO.
Not to put a damper on your downer but the US House and Senate, while still in the control of the Republicans, did move towards blue.  Although Democrats didn't take over, they gained ground in both places.  Similarly, Here in NV, we may have a GOP governor but 3/4 of our CDs are blue and our State Senate and Assembly went blue as well.

Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not defending Pence in the slightest. His policies would be disastrous towards the LGBT and women's rights in general. \n\nThat being said, I can't imagine that he would absolutely destroy our foreign policy like Trump and he would at least conduct himself in a presidential manner. 
I bet this person finished writing this, leaned back on their torn up, formerly white floral print couch in their crumbling trailer home and felt reeeeeal good about themselves
I believe you but do you have sources on those number?

"Wall of Meat" is exceptionally homoerotic, don't you think?

I love how he thinks that Obama *personally* welcomed them into the country, as if there wasn't a gigantic agency responsible for vetting and clearing refugees all the time. 
Except that people have many, many times before. Look up the Central Park 5 case 
Also, wouldn't that mean that double agents would be able to act with impunity? 
Did you listen to Bernie's interview on NPR recently? The interviewer was quite rude and asking ridiculous questions and even suggested that Bernie admired Trump. It's not hard to see the bias. 
How about quitting smoking because you don't want to fuck up your kid's lungs?

There's a difference between recognizing that those countries are embroiled with conflict and banning people from them outright. 
I type well written but embarassing messages
Unfortunately for those people, Israel is a democracy with freedom of speech and expression that doesn't ban ideas just because they're offensive to some. If they want their perfect conservative Islamic perspective to go unchallenged, there are a plethora of neighboring countries that are perfectly able to oblige them. 
Except that there are so many military forces at play that you can't say "everyone is just sitting around doing nothing". The US has been providing support to the Is in their offensive on Mosul and conducting routine air strikes on ISIS targets. Just because we aren't going to send boots on the ground in another fruitless Middle East war doesn't mean that we aren't contributing.
It's almost as if the game wasn't completely finished

I think it also has to do with the age of the individual when they entered the country/area. If she was in her late 40's/early 50's when she arrived in SK, I doubt she would've lost her accent. 
Eh, I'm not sure where this idea that Israelis will go above and beyond to help you out originated but it's not entirely true. Israelis are like people everywhere: some will help you out and some won't. Israeli customer service is probably the worst ever though. 
That YouTube account has since shutdown
Actually, all the refugees from all 7 banned countries has only resulted in 1 terror attack in the US. That's one out of hundreds of thousands
Terrorists deserve to be tried in a court of law and if found guilty, face whatever punishment deemed necessary by the court, not summarily executed in the street after being incapacitated. If Eichmann was able to receive a trial for his crimes, so should everyone else.

Because you're saying that all women should be forced to go through an extremely dangerous and dehumanizing process as a punishment based on the actions of the extreme minority of women who get abortions like in the post. 
There's a difference between eating a placenta because you're so deprived of nutrients and because you're a millionaire hollywood celebrity trying to be "organic"
Also, the Food Pyramid was blatantly incorrect and wasn't even developed by the FDA; it was developed by the Department of Agriculture which conveniently said that you should eat grains the most.  
I've never met a guy that wore studs that was an agreeable person

Deplorable 
Yes, the Visa waiver program which means that they would normally have to apply for visas like everyone else in the world that isn't visa free with the United States. \n\nThat's different than outright banning everyone from those countries, including green card holders and dual citizens. 
Now look at this net 
Unless you're a Chasid, you probably will never use Yiddish. 
Funny story, I used to work in a hostel that would get a lot of German tourists and I tried to teach a group of them to play BS (the card game). It took them awhile to grasp that part of the game involves lying and they were confused on why you'd lie.

I think it's a comment towards how these specific students weren't able to make it into more competitive schools and instead went to their State School. \n\nNot that I'm shitting on State Schools, you can get an excellent STEM education at most State schools. I just know the type. 
It depends on how you do it. I took a gap year between my freshman and sophomore years of college and it was pretty cheap. Granted, I worked my ass off the summer prior and I was working/volunteering for room and board the entire time I was abroad, but it was cheap and I paid for it by myself. \n\nI also didn't go to Cambodia for "enlightenment" or whatever these basic people do 
I'll honestly take President Pence. Pence would be a Dubya Round 2 but at least he's not a puppet government. 
Girls are upset that Backpage, a popular Craigslist-esqe website most notably used for advertising prostitution, was shut down and they can't be hookers as easily anymore. She's saying that all you have to do is work 9-5 and suck off the managers for a raise

Alaska leads the nation in suicide and STDs which means we only have a couple ways of dealing with the darkness
Nope. That's the point of the VP, to take over in the event that the President can no longer do their duty.

"The passport of Bangladesh is valid in all countries of the world except Israel, which is a state not recognized by Bangladesh."\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_passport\n\n"Pakistan does not recognize the state of Israel so its written as observation 'This passport is valid for all countries of the World except Israel' on Pakistani passports"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_passport\n\nso I wasn't entirely right, Bangladeshi and Pakistani passports aren't valid in Israel because their own governments prevent them from traveling there
What about Denmark? Or the Netherlands? Or Sweden and Norway? 
Y'all are forgetting that you can fly over the north pole 
Yeah, State schools are "public" schools, meaning they receive direct funding from the state.

Have you actually watched the movie that the show is based off of?
You don't have to be in the USMC to want to defend an organization with centuries of service and sacrifice. I don't know what your deal is, but there are a wide spectrum of people who serve in all branches and it's incredibly insulting to paint them all with a wide brush based on a false preconceived idea
Yeah of course. I'm born and raised here in AK, I love my home but it's not the easiest place to live

There are reasonable restrictions on basically every right. For example, speech that incites immediate lawless action is prohibited but we still have the First Amendment.

Crossing state lines with the intention to commit a crime is the Mann Act. It turns what would be a smaller crime into a federal offense. Don't mess with it

I think Sombra is more of a distraction character than DPS. Stealth behind the enemy line, hack a few health packs, hack an enemy if you can, try to solo cap until they spot you and split up to kill you, (which leaves their front line vulnerable) then stealth again/port to escape. Not every character has to be about dealing direct damage. 
 I think Alludra could withstand Harpers attacks to finish him off, but she would fall pretty quick to Thom. Thom would be able to beat Alludra, but Harper would roast him. It really depends on where they are all standing when the fight starts.\n\nThat would make for a fun dream sequence episode. 
All the old ones up to the previous expansion (currently Warlords of Draenor) are included with WoW. So you only need to buy WoW and Legion atm.
Someone I knew when I was a kid had their house burn down shortly after Christmas. The only good thing about that, was that everyone in the community was still feeling giving and charitable, so people donated time, money, food, and everything else to them. In the end, they had their home rebuilt, and a second Christmas with a lot of the people around town just about a month later. Happy ending. \n\n\nI told you that story to tell you this. The kids uncle was a plumber, and had personally set up nearly all of the water works in the building, including the showers. A few months later, the shower head falls off, and the kids 15 or 16 year old sister discovers a hidden camera. They disassemble the other shower and find another. Turns out the uncle had banked on the unfortunate event of the house fire to place a few cameras around the house, particularly in the bathrooms and girls rooms. He admitted to it, and I'm not sure how long he went to prison for.
One of my favorite curses doesn't permit the wilder to use any weapon other than the cursed one. If she draws an item with the intent to use it as a weapon or tool- nope, dagger. Put the dagger down, draw rapier- nope, dagger. If she uses the rapier like a lever to pry a door open- dagger. Uses a big stick to knock something out of a tree- dagger. It simply doesn't let her use anything else for any purpose until the curse is broken.
Good try. Maybe tomorrow.
I like that Taako's color scheme is similar to that of an actual taco.
Even if you already know, I find that asking what your daily routine would be like there is always a well received question.
I have an 8 month old daughter and I can't even imagine what goes through those peoples heads. I can't even sit down to watch a 30 minute show in a single sitting if my wife isn't taking care of my daughter. I would never bring her to the movies. Even a kids flick.
If you search for a Power leveling community (just search for "power level") you can join and ask there. Usually you'll find a group in a few minutes, sometimes you have to ask again later on. I've had 4 characters plvled this way this season so far. 
USA probably started it, and is trying to blame everyone Rose.
I can't remember what it's referred to, but there's a theory that the more people that witness a situation where help is required, the less likely it is that someone will help on their own volition. People tend to think "someone else will do it, so I don't have to."
I have a FB friend who deletes her FB every 3 months or so. It's always the "last time" but no-one ever calls her out on it.
He'll spin it so that it looks like he didn't want to run again, rather than he won't be re-elected. It has to remain in his hands. His teeny tiny hands. 
Reading your stories gives me hope. I don't think I could ever muster the courage or verbal finesse to tell off a customer, but I want to every day. I work in a pharmacy, and everytime I hear someone say "My doctor told me they sent in my Rx this morning, so I know you have it!" and we don't have it, I want to tell them their Dr is a lying sack of shit who will have his nurse send it in to us right before they leave for the day, probably with a bunch of errors we won't be able to fix until tomorrow. But of course it's always my fault that we never received it from the Good Dr.
Watch the bloopers, or imagine you own. The main character is being chased by the monster, but she can't stop laughing at the cheesy costume.
A moida most foul!
Found online, so I don't have a page number for you, but \n\n>The white fire of the holy sword painted the tear streaks on her face silver as her mouth dropped open in an expression of shock and stunned joy.

He paused, then admitted, "Granted, He doesn't always answer quite this quickly."
If you right click the buff icon the kite gives you'll descend. Very quickly. This probably won't prevent your dying issue.
I would recommend any of the gathering professions- herring, mining, and skinning and just sell everything you get on the AH. When you get to a higher level, figure out what profs you really want to pursue and use your nest egg from gathering to fund it.
I'm not a fan of Demon Hunters or Tracer, but that works amazingly well as a combo. \n\nI'd love to see Reinhardt as a Tauren if you're looking for ideas for more. Also, Symetra Mage.

Goddammit I thought it was going upward with the gaster one. And yes fucking kill me I wanna know about that fucking sprite
All the players in the games I host have weird quirks, such as one player explaining his name to everyone they meet, or another constantly sneaking around and putting his blade to the back of the throat of whoever another player is talking to, just in case shit hits the fan. Another removing clothing at every opportunity. Another breaking any and all pots and jars Legend of Zelda style because he thinks they contain things he wants (Spoiler: they don't). At first it was frustrating because I'm used to a more serious toned game, but once I started designing my NPCs around their quirks it became super fun. Everyone was trying to out-weird each other. There were chains of NPCs with blades to others throats and none of them knew someone was behind them. "Link" smashed a Funeral Urn, upsetting an entire town which was gathered to pay their last respects to the deceased mayor. \n\nIf everyone plays the same way, it can be fun, but if only one player does so, it can ruin it for everyone. 
Correction: kid buys PS4, justifies it to mom by claiming its for dad.
I mention this a lot for kids games, but [Monsters and Other Childish Things](http://www.arcdream.com/pdf/monsters-quick.pdf) is great. The rules are simple and dice mechanics can be easily adapted to any situation. 
As a Vermonter, I wish I was a Yankee.
Remember, vote Trump, or he'll see you in court.
That would be a good start, yea.
I still have the whole run. I should get some bags for them.
Browse the server forums on the WoW official site. Or if you press "o"  it should pull up a guild finder page, where you can input some info about what you're looking for and browse guilds to apply to.
Easiest way to do it is to disable half of your addons, then trigger a cutscene. If it skips, disable half of those and run it again. If it plays, switch to the half you disabled and try again. Repeat until you find out which one it is.
When I was around 7 or 8, my school had  "Donkey Basketball" once a year. It's exactly what it sounds like, basketball played on donkeys. It was always some fundraiser thing, but I dont remember what for. My mom and I would go see it every year. This year, the bleachers right in front of us were mostly empty for a few rows down, so I was having fun and bouncing around like kids do.\n\n After a few minutes I get tired of that and stand up and sit back on my moms lap without looking back at her. I grab her hand, and realize it feels a little different than normal. I look down and think "Huh, her skin is really wrinkly, and I can feel her bones. And where did this ring come fro-" I turn around into the face of some old lady I've never seen before and instantly start crying. She laughs and my mom picks me up (she was sitting 2 feet away, i just moved to the side while I was playing). After a few minutes I calm down and we all have a good laugh over how surprised they said my face looked when I realized that wasn't my moms hand. 
Congrats on the 800 miles of paved roads, BTW.
You should try working in a pharmacy. "I have Medicaid, this should be free! You must be doing something wrong!" Nope, even with Medicaid you still owe $1. It sucks that the insurance you don't pay for only covers $6,244 and not the whole thing, I know. What's the point of even having it if you still have to pay?
Uh-oh... It's all starting to come together now...
I've never wanted a rice cooker more than I do right now. 
On second thought, his leg seems to be working just fine.
I like how no-one is paying them any attention. "Same shit, different day..."
Damn, that's pretty intense for a kids show. Just gave me some inspiration for a Dnd adventure.
Right, they pretty much want to make sure you're devoting your life to them. All of your life. Anything else, family, friends, other responsibilities comes second. You work your ass off for the company and ignore everything else, and they might give you a chance to make more money. 
All of the barbarian builds I find don't use the primary attack, instead they depend on Rends bleed effect to build rage. I don't have good luck with that, so I just pick the Unforgiving talent, and whirlwind everywhere. Works great for me. The few times I can't, due to getting trapped, I use my cleave to build rage if needed, or I put down a Volcanic Avalanche, and the kills anything around me. You have to find what works best with your playstyle.
That's what I love most about Jim's portrayal of Michael. He's a Holy warrior, yes. But he's also a father, a husband, a friend, and a mortal human. He's a "Good Man" to be sure, but even he has his breaking points.
Probably not until 100 at this point. Heirlooms are available up to level 100. They increase the leveling speed, and are BiS until they max out, so you'll see them a lot.
If you wait a couple more levels you shouldn't have any problems soloing it. Alternatively, if you ask for a party in general chat you may be able to find a group that way.
Well, no. It was tempting, but we decided it was too big for us. Half the house would never be used, but we would still be paying high property taxes.
There's a good chance he was decked out in Heirloom gear, which is gear that levels up as you do, and is always the best gear available. It's meant to make leveling an alt easier and faster. You'll be able to buy heirlooms later on. \n\nDon't worry too much about gear at your level. You'll end up replacing it almost as soon as you get it. Just focus on leveling for now, and worry about gear when you get to max level.\n\n[Here's some guides for you to check out, hope they help.](http://www.wowhead.com/classes#shaman)
Eatons Sugarhouse in Royalton is a local favorite.
The show "The Whispers" did this, too. It wasn't a great show, but the wife and I enjoyed it, and it was starting to get really interesting at the end of the first season. They even showed a preview of next season, but just never came back on.
I thought it was going to be a camel peeing in a basin or something  and the guy comes up after and he just didn't realize what it was. No, he gets it right from the source...
You can sometimes see other useful stuff, like a hidden sniper you didn't see before, or a portal if they have one, or an ambush point they have setup, etc. Not always, but often enough to make it worthwhile.
"Sorry, that was meant to be a relaxing massage, didn't mean to wake you up. I'll go now."
I used to work in a hospital, and everywhere in the employee areas are signs that say very clearly, if you're sick, call out. I called twice 2 months apart because I was really sick, and was told that if I call out a third time in the next 12 months, I would be fired. I don't understand how they expect anyone to work in public service while sick, it just spreads the illness, and especially in a hospital where even a minor sickness could literally kill someone.
Not gonna lie, I was just about to google that...

There are a few places to watch cutscenes at will. The fountain in old Dalaran, someone in the garrison headquarters, those are the 2 that come to my mind.
I saved my money for months to buy that game. Did extra chores, did stuff for the neighbors, if I wasn't at school or sleeping, I was doing something to earn enough money to buy a N64 and that game. When the day finally came, I asked my mom to drive me to the store after school because I couldn't wait any longer. I bought the N64, and to reward me for working so hard, my mom bought the game for me, even though I had enough for both. I didn't grow up with a ton of money, and for a good portion of my young life, we were using food stamps to get by, so this was a huge thing for her to do for me. \n\nWe still had to go grocery shopping that night, but I sat in the car looking at the boxes and reading the guides. When I finally got home, I unloaded the car, then ran to my room with my purchase. I set up the N64, and grab the bag to get the game... But it's not there. I look everywhere, in all the bags, in every box, in the car, under the car, I even run down the street thinking it somehow escaped on the way home. I run crying to my mom and tell her it's missing, and she helps me look for it to no avail.\n\n 2 hours later, after sitting on my bed holding the N64 controller with no games to play, I decide I'm hungry. So I go out to the kitchen and grab some oreos and milk, and notice a familiar looking box in the refrigerator. My mom had put the game box in the fridge without realizing what it was. IIRC, the box was very similar the the off brand of margarine she always bought. I was so happy, I ran back to my room, stopping only to shout "I found Zelda! " at my mom on my way. \n\nThat's it. Story over. Carry on.
Can this not be the new planking craze? I don't want to see "moron falls out of moving car because he was hanging onto the side of a moving car like a moron" headlines.
Please be good. Please be good. Please be good. \n\n\nI heard about this game a while back and am super excited for it, but I'm so worried it's going to just be another overhyped garbage game.
Children's toys that play lullabies automatically. My daughter has a toy that sings to her, and it goes off on its own to remind you that it's on. Most toys that do that do so every 2 to 3 minutes, but this one waits 2 hours before randomly playing "hush little baby"  or "twinkle, twinkle little star" late at night. I'm about to fall asleep and I suddenly hear someone singing to my child from her room and it really freaks me out everytime.
When I was around 10, I went to visit my dad the weekend after Christmas. (parents divorced when I was 2. I saw him pretty often, but looking  back, you could tell it wasn't really his choice to have me over for a weekend each month.). He gave me a bag of backgammon dice and a budweiser beer stein. Just what every 10 year old boy wants.

I saw the Enquirer yesterday at work, the top reads "New evidence Obama wasn't born in the US". Jesus, give it up people! He's only in office for a few more days, can we drop that lie already?
As a new Pathfinder GM myself, this post is incredibly helpful for things I haven't experienced yet. 
My mom had a similar rule for me. I ate what I could at the meal, but had to save and eat anything left over before I could eat anything else. Didn't eat my pork chop for dinner? Guess what's for breakfast.

Well, you're right, but I don't think "Because I Said So: Toward a Feminist Theory of Authority" is what he meant. \n\n
I've never seen nor heard "pleb" used as a verb, and I'm not sure it works. \n\nAs to your actual complaint, yes, sniping good deals does require some luck. It's good for getting a quick pile of gold if you make the right purchase, but it's not reliable enough for a steady income. \n\nIf you're just trying to build capitol, running old raids is a perfectly decent way to make a few thousand gold per week. Once you have enough saved up, research markets on your server. You probably won't be able to shuffle felslate constantly, because that's already a well known profit, but look at what crafted items cost vs the ingredients, and how quickly they sell to find your own niche. You shouldn't follow everything on this subreddit word for word, use it as a guide and find your own means to success.
When my wife and I were looking to buy, we were shown this beautiful Tudor style house way under our budget, and way, way under what it would normally go for. Turns out a lady and her husband lived there. Her son (not his) came to the house often, I guess they played poker or something every weekend. One visit, things got heated, and the son killed his stepfather and his own mother with a hammer, then killed himself in the garage. The poor daughter/sister was stuck dealing with the house, and just wanted to get rid of it.
Could have been shopping with others, I've seen that. They have a main cart, which they leave, usually out of the way, and everyone has carts and baskets to walk around the store and meet up at the main cart later to pay.
That's too bad, I was really hoping I found something good. Oh well. Thanks!
My daughter is only 5 months old right now, but I can't wait to introduce her to games like this. I'll have to write down your method so I remember it when the time comes.
Wow, yea, that's the one.
Harry Johnson\n\nAlso used to work with a kid who's name was "H", which he said was short for Heroin. I doubted it at first, but then discovered his siblings: Mary-Jane and Opie (Opium)
Kind of similar, I work in a pharmacy, and the number of people who don't keep track of the medications they take is astounding. \n\nJust last night, I had a customer come to the counter for a med which she literally cannot miss a dose or she risks major heart problems within hours. Of course,  she has no refills. For a smart person this isn't a problem, because they reorder well in advance in case something comes up. This old gal, of course, has no tablets left, and it's 8pm on a Friday night. I'm willing to do anything I can to help customers out, especially in situations like this. Usually, I just go talk to the pharmacist and we'll loan her enough until her Dr can be reached,  pretty standard. But she just starts screaming at me! "What do you mean you can't fill this? Are you trying to kill me? I'm going to die if you don't call my Dr right now!" \n\n I hate helping these people. I still will, obviously, but her acting like this and then getting what she wants just makes her think she won something, and she gloats the entire time. The situation would have turned out the same way (gave her 5 pills to last until the Dr responds) if she had just calmly said "I didn't realize I was out, what should I do?", except I wouldn't be dreading seeing her again.

I've lived in my house for 4 years and have had my mailbox hit 5 times. I call to report it every time, and it's always the same guy telling me it's my fault for putting my mailbox too close to the road. That's how mailboxes work, dumbass. They sit next to the road all year long, until you come along and drag it to the end of the street after plowing 2 inches of snow. 
Keep in mind that if the hunter has a bodyguard with them, the hunter will have to attack it a few times before taming it, so as not to lose the beasts attention to the bodyguard.

My roommate in college had his parents come and take him out for a day or 2 every month because he needed the time to relax. From 2 states away, they would drive down 1 or 2 weekends a month and just do whatever he wanted. Arcade all day, Universal Studios, beach, weekend cruise, whatever. \n\n\nAlso, they never invited me.

Check out the [Dresden Files RPG](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/3717/dresden-files-roleplaying-game). Sounds like it's pretty close to what you're looking for. Runs on the Fate system, but investigation is a pretty big part of the books it's based off of.

Democratic politicans who get their campsigns sponsered by corporations.   \nThey tend to try to keep politics to themselves and are scared of unchained politicans like bernie.  \nEvery single decision they make must be accepted by their sponsors. And since these sponsors also pay republicans, it doesnt matter to them which party is in power. Thats also why they prefer to concede seats to republicans rather than unsponsored candidates.

I don't think its extremism is lack of the ability to doubt ones own view of the world.

Free Speech isnt about legality or opinion, its about respecting the intelligency of your audience and allowing them a view into someone elses head.

I'd say just shy of 25k. She shoots the boss 9 times, but the last time is only ~half of 2911, as effective damage. 
She's amazing still on SpiderQueen map and Dragonshire.

Also, now Greymane's Cursed Bullet, which is picking up popularity steam.
Hands down, not the only one. But, I have to also agree with the previous poster a bit as well, as it is antithetical to HotS's design, which is why I think it would make a great candidate for a separate queue. 
I love Heroes, but QM is absolutely terrible. Only like 1/5 games feel like a fair match making/ team comp. The rules/algorithm need changed, for sure. 
Anthropologically speaking, there is an argument to be made that male humans are attracted to breasts in that they represent a full buttock. When our late ancestors evolved to stand upright, the males of the species may have grew to be attracted to large breasts, as their posture was further increased to viewing less direct contact with the female's buttock/genitals and more with their face and upper torso.

game balance > fantasy, Blizzard has stated this many time. He also has iceblock and a flying drone, which are quite un-druidy. 
Seriously, how in the world is that possible? 
Um, except Arti is a boss, and is lvl 90 versus 67, not too sure how they're similar tbh.
Didn't you read the TIL? He said it wasn't from oil/water interaction with light.\n\nedit: jesus, people. It's sarcasm. 
Before groupies changed to a quest talent, he could absolutely heal as much as BW in late game, if in melee range of his allies. On a map like Spider Queen or Dragonshire, you could get like 55+ globes in a 25 minute game
Absolutely worked for me, I have a 6* Talc in storage. took about a month.

It's a grey area in a lot of ways between what **IS** fake news and biased, partisan B.S. news. 
Perfect metaphor, 10/10.
Wait, people are just going about their business while a dude gets sucked off in the corner?! that's crazy!
In a lot of ways, much better.
I wonder how we would have such a cute video IF PEOPLE DIDNT FILM IT. This circlejerk is SOOOOOOOOOO old.
Sunk cost fallacy? 
If I'm not mistaken, it's from an ad.
I wish a had a hung, horny coworker friend like you.
Every single hero in this GAME is perfectly viable, and just people the best of the very best pro players do not pick her, is not a sign of if she's viable. I refer you back to my original statement, that the illusion that she is trash, makes the entire community thin she's trash. I wouldn't focus on what GMs think the meta is, unless you're one of the top 2500 people in the game in your region. 
You mean, Varian should have committed suicide? Makes sense.
Since there is few **major** cases to prove this, I think technically this is an assumption - the leading assumption, and the one I agree with, but it's not empirical proof.
I feel like attempting to penetrate our own government officials is like screaming at a wall.
Quick match? Because QM is a cesspool. 
First off, I'm not an anthropologist with primary research, but tons of anthropology is a theory with little to no proof, what's your point? 
Yo, fo real doh, if yo team pvping in midlane 4v5 and it's 4 mins into the game, imma be farmin bot lane fo XP. Fuck dem niggas
Cause it's cute? Its not like it's a Doritos commercial, its an ad for love and ending hate, not exactly subliminally messaging you to put credit on your card.
What a circlejerk this comment looks like it became. You can derive a "type" from this photo and it not be about the fact that the guy is almost perfect in the standard sense. His type could be tan smooth skin, with a small bush, or something. Surely this can be someone else's type, and also be like the paragon version of it. It can also easily not be someone's type. 
That's half the fun, but, mainly that more than half of the posts when this TIL was posted were referring to the oil on water shine?...\n
She's literally the most global hero in the game, with Nydeus, and can show up to the fight after clearing two lanes ~15 seconds later, at full mana and health. I strongly disagree there are 5 better global heroes, that bring more to the table than wards.
Is Zenyatta a Viking? 
It's completely beyond reason to ever assume any animal, or life form in general, would ever stop procreating.
You're really in the minority. I'm pretty sure, even with the changes to the terror vehicle, most people hate this map above all else. \n\nedit: to each his own, though. I personally moan every time I get this map, however.
They gave her Nydus Worm nexus healing, though, which makes her less oppressive 1v1, but extremely sustainable nonetheless. 
I want to join you in holy matrimony. 
Yeah, so anti-melee blind build is very viable. 4-man blind, with a 25% slow, rest of the talents go into healing, makes her very annoying for a melee heavy enemy team. All you need is some lock down to counter with, and they kill themselves. Her mana with Conjurer's Pursuit, and her throughput with Kungfu Hustle makes your team bream with HP.
My three siblings and I made a small camp fire in the backyard and put a multi-pack of lighters in it to "See what would happen." After all but one of them exploded, I poked the last one with a twig and the melted plastic casing opened up exposing the lighterfluid. I was like 7, and my dipshit siblings +2/4/&6 years older than me let me. I assumed they too were curious.
Mind if I do it, and decline to join?
Also, Abathur and TLV have a 4% and 1% pickrate according to this website. They are Zagara's only competition when it comes to global splitpushing, and I will bet my bottom dollar Aba is not picked to go splitpushing build, but rather Symb/poke build. 
Why is an anti-racism post ruining your day so fucking hard? Reddit is dictated by current times and political climate, it's not that big of a fucking deal, good lord. Again, downvote it, and move on, you're screaming at the ocean.
Druids are nature based, so as for the flying robot, I think that's self-explanatory. \n\nIceblock however in WoW, is a Mage specific ability. In reality Jaina would be the only hero who can use Iceblock, posssssibly Kael, since he is a WoW mage, but is a Fel-corrupted Fire mage.
Only time I've tried poppers it just have me a headache, kinda like brainfreeze. I just assumed they were cheap or knockoff. 
Yes and no. There's nothing wrong with the assessment that people derive meaning from their struggles, because they absolutely do. The old cliche is what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and I know personally, having a reason to leave the house such as work, is absolutely the only reason I do. There's a medium here, between a job being the sole factor of what people find meaning from, and a reality that responsibility does make a person better/stronger/smarter/able... and the idea that people will automatically find a driving force when their lives are freed up from a desk and chain.
sPITacular O_O
Displacer Beast would be a more appropriate talent, Druids have that in game (which I also assume in Lore).
FUUUCCCKKK popup videos, scared the shit out of me.
What sort of abuse does a gay kid have to suffer, to look to Hitler as an idol? 
Best zone in the game, amazing idea!
Hopefully one of them will at least be funny, then!
The younger generations in america are increasingly favoring socialistic ideals, mixed with capitalism. 18-34 year old college kids are drastically more progressive than their GenX/baby boomer relatives, for example, even when compared to when they were that age. 
That was absolutely a "I can and will cut your fucking finger off, bro," sound!
Doomfist confirmed. 
I think the fire witch makes the level too hard for some people, I would imagine. A AoE cleanse and heal, if my guess as to why she was removed.

Every post, even if it was a post of a kitten under a blanket, where all you can see is the blanket and it's a zoom in shot so it's completely grey, is marked NSFW in this (and many adult-content) subs.
I think my reason, and most likely others, like Dragonshire is because of all the 1v1 and 2v2s, with really high stakes 5v5s. It's very high stress and requires people to really understand the strengths and weaknesses of their hero. \n\nI vote for Tower of Doom (Though Dragonshire is a very close second), however. I think it's the most original map, and has a lot of the same high stakes as Dragonshire. 
Well, I said he's stepping down if he wins the DNC chair, so as long as he makes them transparent, and vows to end lobbying and corporate welfare of the Democrats, he could have wrote Ted's law himself, and I still see Keith as better than like 94% of the people on that stage. 
She's still a 1v1 laning monster, are you kidding? 
I'd ask for more than just a tip.
LOADS of people will not pick a hero due to that hero's appearance of being bad. Zagara can be rediculous on many maps with Nydeus. She just less facerace 1v1 damage now, but only by a margin. She's perfectly viable.\n\nAlso, how does playing a hero you think is UP make someone a special snowflake? 
Just pulled a Oberon (Light Fairy-king). I also have a Water Monkey King, and am curious which is a safer option for arena and GWs? MY first instinct is to pair Oberon with a Konamiya, and nuke the enemy team's key monster, making it 3v2 from then on in GWs. \n\nI don't currently have the runes and devilmon to invest into both, so I need to choose. 
Time to shelf Abathur for a while, and pick up the frog.
I feel like they didn't even look at the reference photo. That looks like a muppet with a hijab...
Maybe thinking of MadTV?
That's fuckin adorable but the captions really make it :D
Maybe try an IUD? Its really difficult to get pregnant with an IUD but once you take it out, you can have a pregnancy easily once you are ready. Don't guilt trip yourself over it, you probably wouldn't have been able to care for kids at those ages and you did what was best for you. \nAlso, speaking as someone who had an abortion at 19 and ended up having my first child at 21, wait to have kids. Spend your 20s being selfish and stupid, don't be a mom when you're still a kid yourself. \n\nJust my opinions... (I'm 32 with two kids now)

Hearing voices is part of delusional behavior and is very much a symptom of schizophrenic behavior: "Psychological: hallucination, paranoia, hearing voices, depression, fear, persecutory delusion, or religious delusion" are all symptoms of schizophrenia. \n\nHowever, if you felt I used it incorrectly, let me amend it by saying "delusional behavior of hearing voices" which can also be a symptom of schizophrenia.

haven't there been news stories of people suffocating or freezing/cooking to death by trying to live in poorly insulated storage lockers?
Are you sure the cousin isn't screwing with you? Like touching and being close to your bf just to drive you crazy? Girls can be like that, especially if your boyfriend mentioned it to her about you feeling jealous. 
I don't go to Starbucks myself but just reading through, i don't even understand how this can all apply to one single drink..
I didn't know they had flocked funko! \n
Well, then its premature to tell people who don't remember the alternate ME that they don't belong on this /r/. OP asked if anyone does NOT remember, so the people who don't remember Sinbad as a genie are replying.
Berenstein/stain affected me but not this one with Sinbad. So I guess the theory is that every ME is from its own timeline where only that happened and nothing else was different? If so, how can you explain people being affected by multiple ME's but other people only being affected by one? Were they not in the same timeline? I'm not trying to be difficult, I am just trying to understand the premise here.
I have this black mask peel. If you try to wash it off, it takes literally forever and it normally still doesn't ever wash off completely. I don't like it for that reason.
Thanks! I know the video is a little old and I've seen it before (and so have a ton of people.) I figured this is the perfect place for it to gain some new views :D
Yep,had two in the past seven years, best thing ever for a person who forgets pills like there is no tomorrow. I got pregnant 3 times on the pill but I haven't even had one "scare" since I've used an IUD. I tell everyone about them, get one if you can!
Well, to be fair, the bag IS camouflage...
I feel like this is bordering on satire. I also feel like it would lead to an increase in schizophrenic behavior, since we would all be hearing voices in our heads randomly throughout the day...
The foster children change is a positive one, at least.
Do it! You've made it this far in life, celebrate being You!
this has already been posted to /r/WTF. It was directly under this link on my front page\n
This is deeply disturbing to me, for some reason. But I love it and want to make my own, as well.
Sell it. Collectors pay nicely for naturally mummified animals...
I am not sure about the no dental insurance but I know Triad Family Dental is wonderful. My kids and I have been patients there for a little over a year now and its the most gentle dentist I've ever had. http://www.triadfamilydental.com/\nAlternatively, I know that there are dental clinics through the county for uninsured people but I've never been to one. http://www.myguilford.com/humanservices/health/
Awesome, day before my birthday
I'm actually kind of surprised at this outcome.
https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz\n\n\nMight give you some clarity. I took it before the primaries last year and it helped me with knowing which party shared my interests.
I just want to know where the guy came from. I paused the video and there doesn't appear to be a doorway or a hall where he was standing. It just looks very strange, like he was standing behind the ambassador the entire time.\n\n\nedit: I know more about the scenario now, since more information has come out. It was just confusing after the story broke and not much was getting released about it.
I wasn't expecting him to continue flying after the cut. I'm glad he's okay or I would feel horrible for the amount of giggling i did..
Done!
Sometimes it can happen from crying too, just in case the sneezing excuse doesn't pan out
He had a pretty serious heart attack and had to go through surgery, maybe that was what triggered people thinking he died?
The Cuddle Cot program is in the US, also. It's a great resource for parents who have lost a baby because if you keep the body cool, it will stave off decomp (for a little while at least.) \nIf you ever find yourself wanting to donate money to a worth-while cause, Cuddle Cots would be it, in my opinion. Giving grieving parents a few days with a baby as opposed to a couple of hours is worth it.\n\nedit: grammar 
"tax benefits"
All of the pupils look faked...
I went back to the church while I was dating someone who was super-extra religious, Southern Baptist. I tried to go with him on sundays and get involved, since I was very religious as a teen but it fell away as I got older. But no, I felt like I was watching from the outside, seeing these people SO devoted to everything that the preacher said and I was just biding time until it was time to leave. We dated for about 4 months and that was it, I got tired of faking it and he got tired of me not being obviously bible-thumping. I'll never go back. 
Maggots...
Thank you, I will look that up
AUVI-Q AffordAbility™ is a first-of-its-kind access program for AUVI-Q.\n\n"$0 out of pocket for all commercially insured patients including high deductible plans.\n(Terms and Conditions)"\n\nLooks like they offer it for insured patients as well, unless I am misreading?
>"oh"<
My kids elementary school already almost lost their art teacher, thankfully, she now splits her time between two schools so they can still have that class. They lost some other teachers and most of the aides this year as well
the child is deformed and probably has Microcephaly or her brain is outside of her skull, among other things...Its a horrible story but more due to lacking prenatal care rather than depression, imo
You get samples too? Can you give us an idea, price-wise?
Most of these were tough to see, especially the accidental death photos.
That lemon comic is probably my favorite of all time. It gives me a giggle every time I see it, no matter what :D
Fetlife might be helpful for you. Lots of women have this fetish, maybe it will give you some "comfort"?
I dated a crazy Xtian who tried to convince me that only micro-evolution was real. He was *insanely* devoted to the thought but he never was able to fully explain it to me. I studied physical Anthropology in college so I brought my side of the argument as well.

I love this. It looks like a painting someone might find untouched after a house fire, like its got a mind of its own. Great shadows
I'd totally send my kids to a Satanic school
The fact that he called and tried to convince you that it "didn't happen" showed that he knew what he did. Don't let this eat you up inside, talk to someone who can help you work through it.
well, I can't say for sure but given the religious climate in my area of North Carolina, it would've been on the news had certain people been aware of it. Maybe it enlightened a few people on the highway :)
Did they mention the bio-mother or father? The article didn't really say anything, it's a bit odd for her to be caring for her stepson alone (not rare but odd they didn't mention the child's actual parents at all)
Aww, this made me sad
This is a segment from a Je video. She has a lot more on her youtube page
