I removed the logo from my MPOW TKL the other day with acetone free nail polish and it removed some of the case so this is a great idea. My wife has a Cricut cutter so if I can find the dimensions (or an SVG) of the steel plate I can just have the machine cut it for me. \n\nLove how this looks and I think I may just go with a matte black (or beige / white) vinyl to allow for some key color customizations. \n\n

But oh no if you say something to them it's always "stop living in the past" bullshit. Half of their fans weren't alive to see their cup win in 1994. 
That color combination is fantastic! 👌🏻
¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
So I just got my Gramr 84 and have the same issue with loose stabilizers causing really bad rattle. I am pretty new to MKs so I just had two quick questions if you don't mind.\n\n1. What kind of lube did you use and where do you get it? Do you just apply it from the top of the case or do you apply it from underneath with the board taken apart?\n2. What type of glue did you use and where did you apply the glue to make sure it didn't rattle? Do you have any pictures?\n\nThanks!
doot doot!
Can anyone recommend an inexpensive key set for the Drevo Gramr 84? Has 1u right modifiers and 1.75u right shift. \n\nI believe from what I'm reading that DAS key sets usually cover these use cases but I know those are relatively high in price. Am I going to find anything cheaper?\n\nThanks in advance. 
Yellowcard lyrics? 👌🏻
The Silhouette can cut steel (or at least thin metal), but I was talking about cutting a vinyl to place over top of the keyboard to cover my attempt at removing the logo with some acetone-free nail polish (maybe even change the color to white or beige).\n\n[Using Keyboard Layout Editor & Case Builder I got pretty close to what I think is correct](http://imgur.com/1xj7BVU), so I need to check these exact measurements and then have the Circuit cut it to see how close this is to exact.
Looks lost out there. Making some horrible decisions too. 
HENRIQUE! The Rangers killer!
Something our players do to our own goalie. 
I purchased an MPOW MP-99 (TOMOKO clone) about two weeks and have really been loving using a mechanical keyboard - I'm even in the market for one for work (that's quieter than the blue switches this has). \n\nLast week I decided to try my hand at removing he unsightly logo above the arrow keys by using some diluted acetone-free nail polish remover. Even though it was diluted it still removed some of the rubberized coating. \n\nMy wife has a Cricut machine so with the help of a lot of measuring, Adobe Illustrator and some assistance from (TaeKeyboards on YouTube)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCllGwtW6scxAjM28fIgEozg] I was able to cut some matte black vinyl to cover the top plate. \n\nThere are some measurements that were slightly off which all hide under the keys except for one small crease. I'm going to make this change in Illustrator and possibly find some more fun vinyl since this will become a project keyboard - next step is making it detachable USB. 
Thanks for confirming
I'm trying to cut a vinyl sticker to place over my Tomoko TKL which I messed up when trying to take off the logo - what is the size of the cutout for the switch on your board?\n\nThanks in advance!
Oh wow thanks bud. A bit pricer than I was expecting but this is only my 2nd week here (averaging 1 new board a week, haha) so still getting used to pricing. \n\nI have a keycap set coming from Ali Express so I shall see what the coverage on that is. \n\nThanks again!
Blues may be a bit loud for the office but I have this one that I really enjoy and comes in well below your budget. \n\nHttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DBJTZU2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_mkhVybWVVPN29
Oh these look awesome!
Waiting for my new keycaps to come in and then I'll be buying a new cable to match. Can't wait to purchase!
My favorite band!\n\nPS - love how this looks, haha. 
Barclays has this too but that isn't a real hockey arena. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Luckily I am into photography, craft beer and expensive whiskey / bourbons so this is just another thing to add to my list. My wife doesn't mind and I figure I can build one with my son when he's old enough to understand what's going on. 
I bought a Drevo Gramr 84 the other day (waiting for it to show up) and I absolutely love how your middle one (which looks to be exactly the same layout) looks awesome.\n\nWhat keycap set did you buy to get those weirdly sized modifier keys?\n\nThanks!
If the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th lines could provide some offense that'd be great. If Jon Merrill could stop being himself that'd be great. \n\nAlso, it's crazy to see smiles Wood be kept up with by the Rangers defense. 
I have a 75% keyboard with MX Red clones & 0.2mm dampeners and some people type louder on their regular keyboards than my keyboard is. 
Zajac should've taken the shot

Without Cory it's easily 4 or 5 goals. 
Even Merrill is getting shots on net. What even is this team?

What a fucking dive. Usually I know Dano can be a bit of a homer but holy shit was he right for ripping on Tavares for that. 
Wait what the fuck. It's not even in Standard Def?! Why are the Islanders on two channels. \n\nOne of these better be listed wrong. 
Coreigh. 
Okay cool - thank you. Maybe I'll just wait for Adafruit to get the mini-USB board back in stock to order the exact one you used so I know it lines up. Also, I didn't even think about just using the cable that's already in there - not a bad idea at all. \n\nThanks again - this is going to be my work board and it's easier to lock up in my drawer or toss in my bag with a detachable cable instead of unplugging the USB from the back of the computer daily. 
20 minutes - need an early goal to keep the energy with the Devils fans.
I see these desk mats in a lot of pictures - which one is yours & what is the use of them?
Oh awesome! Okay I just sent them an email asking about what i could do to make this work correctly and even if i just buy a set of modifiers that would be perfect for me.\n\nSeeing the font in person isn't as bad as it seems online but I definitely want to do something about the keys as black is just really boring, haha.\n\nThanks again!
My buddy at the game said Sevo went to change but no one hopped onto the ice? Anyone see this?\n\nIf so fuck that. How is everyone not ready to jump those boards. It's 3-on-3 against one of the faster teams in the league. 
FUCK ME I WAS RIGHT! PALMS! 🚨🚨🚨 
I'm in the market for something similar and I think I may give the Drevo calibur a shot and just swap the Win & Alt keycaps and hanged the modifiers in System Preferences. \n\nFrom what I've read on here the new version with Bluetooth 4.0 fixes any connectivity issues. \n\nIt's between that and the Anne Pro. 
Right now I have 2 - Tomoko TKL & Drevo Gramr 84. The Tomoko is going to be my learning board - going to practice soldering on it and replacing some switches. 
1st - this looks incredible!\n\n2nd - I just got my Gramr in the mail today and I was browsing WASD to buy keys today. It's like you read my mind.\n\nWould you be able to list what you bought from them so I can buy modifiers that will fit? I already have a 104-key kit coming from AliExpress but want to do some colored modifiers to set it apart. \n\nThanks so much!
Let me know if you have an extra. 
Yup once I get home I'll send over the Illustrator / SVG file. I'd recommend making some minor measurements around the top row of keys and the stabalizers around the space bar but other than that it's almost a perfect fit. 
I have 0.4mm rings for mine and it makes a world of difference. I have a 75% with reds at work though and no one notices. 
There were two - "If you know the Rangers suck, clap your hands" & a Rangers suck chicken dance which was a new one to me. 
The MPOW was my first MK - still use it all the time! Love the clicky-ness of the blues. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KWqxSiL.jpg
You just need more alcohol. 
I absolutely love this and would be the perfect time to put together a full set for my Drevo Gramr 84 because of how hard it is to find 1u right modifiers and 1.75u right shift. \n\nCould you accommodate that?
Hynes said Kinkaid started tonight or Tuesday and after the Devils won last night I thought we would see Cory back in net and Cammy in for Blender. This was an absolute must win and I think Cory should've been in net. \n\nI think sitting Cammy for one game is enough to get him motivated to do something but that's just me. 
You can get the Tomoko / MPOW MP-99 TKL for just about that price. Comes with Cherry MX Blue clones & a great starter keyboard. I just bought it a few weeks ago and I absolutely love typing on it compared to any previous keyboard. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KWqxSiL.jpg
This is one of my favorite posters yet - such great detail. Not sure what it has to do with Ottawa but I guess that's what happens when you need to design two posters for the same opponent after playing them 5 days ago. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
That is correct. 
This FiOS / MSG Networks thing is bullshit - there is no HD on FiOS tonight. Now I have to choose to watch the Rangers feed or this in Standard Def. \n\nThis is so fucking annoying.\n\nAnyone use Kodi / NHL Streams on a Fire Stick?
You can see the rubbed off part of the case where the logo used to be - https://i.imgur.com/2ZzMyhR.jpg\n\nPart of me says I should've left the logo, but I'm almost done perfecting the top plate layout on the Cricut so it should fit the keyboard inch for inch. For now I'm just going to do black vinyl because my local crafts store had it and I've been thinking about spray-painting (or Plasti Dipping) the bottom case white to make an interesting storm trooper look. \n\nI wish we could remove the top plate fully because I would've fully plasti-dipped the entire thing. 
Sorry to bump an old(ish) post but wondering if you ever got around to doing it? 
Very new to this and in the market for a Bluetooth MK - which one is this? Looks great! 👌🏻
Good. 
It's just an old laptop I have out because when I work from home he likes to try to type emails on mine. 
I think the problem with cleaning up rebounds is that especially against the Rangers if someone pinches without coverage the Rangers are guaranteed to be off on an odd man rush. \n\nThey have so much speed it's ridiculous.  
Right from the Rangers twitter feed. I can't even argue with Rangers fans on Twitter. This is straight up fucking embarrassing. 
Jesus Christ Taylor Hall. Thank you Coreigh. 
Direct line of sight between Raanta and Quincey. Easiest save he will make all night. 
But we already have D to expose in th draft. 
I believe the Tomoko & MPOW are all rebranded EagleTec boards. But yeah I like mine but it's a bit too loud for work. I may swap the Blues out for Browns and use it at work. 
My son is napping - trying not to wake him up.
Neither could Hallsy. Story of the season though. No puck luck. 
**THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING**
Lifted his stick - totally clean play. 
A mix of a Pale Ale & a Blood Mary? Sounds good to me.
Team Tank reporting for duty!
I just got the same one a few weeks ago as my first MK and I absolutely love it. I cut a black vinyl to lay over top to hide the logo and borrowed a few keycaps from a friend and it looks like a totally different board now. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KWqxSiL.jpg
I read the responses to one of their tweets about Everyone Can Play night and it's a shit show in there. I don't get it. I think this is great that the NHL is doing this, but maybe some people just can't understand. \n\n¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Cmon Palms - give us the hatty. Doot.
How easy is swapping the switches on this keyboard? 
I've always loved the white main keys & colored modifiers - looks great!\n\nHave you thought about doing F5-F8 in the green color as well? I've seen some people do that and it kind of balances the board out a bit. 
It's time for the PSE&G POWER PLAY!
Unless you wanna listen to the Rangers feed. 
You can buy a Drevo Gramr 84 on Amazon right now for $40. I just grabbed one form eBay with red switches for the same price. 
I want to do the same to my incoming Drevo Gramr 84. I found these two items on SparkFun - are these the correct breakout board and jumper cables? Obviously I'd cut one of the ends off the jumper cable and cut its length down if needed. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PI7cLtI.jpg\n\nThanks!
Relatively knew to /r/MK - what's with the flipped space bar? Looks awesome though. 
Tried searching for eBay Netherlands but I don't really speak the language to know the results or cost but see if this helps. \n\nhttp://m.ebay.nl/sch/i.html?_nkw=Tomoko+keyboard&isNewKw=1&mfs=GOCLK&acimp=0&_trksid=p2053742.m2428.l1313.TR0.TRC0.Xtomoko+keyboard&sqp=tomoko+keyboard
It's time for the PSE&G POWER PLAY, AGAIN!
Would you be able to do a white 37 with the rest of the keyboard black? Unless I haven't searched hard enough I can't find this look and I'm looking to see what it would look like if bought a set of white from Bang Good. \n\nThanks!
Also vaguely interested
Sure could! The cheaper price is making me consider a Type-S now..\n
How is this cheaper than buying from Smart Imports at the moment? Currently sitting at AUD $283 now. Am I missing something?\n\nhttp://www.smartimports.net/products/Happy-Hacking-Keyboard-Professional2-.html
Is this still available?
From what I can gather, it's a lightweight way of having nice DOM selector functionality without the bulk of something like JQuery.

Ah yep, awesome.
If you have a resin printer your caps will feel way better. 
https://puu.sh/ureDb/4006c99806.png\n\nI ordered that from shapeways, i does feel kindda cheap compared to a normal keycap but it fits well and works like any other keycap.
I designed a 2u spacebar that I had printed at shapeways. It was OK. I didnt care for the material and I designed it too thin. But overall my goal was achieved. 
I found keycaps are pretty hard to get right on an FDM printer (which you probably have at school). In particular, the contact surface of the stem with the print-surface is very small, so it has a tendency to detach at some point. This can be mitigated by surrounding the stem with a brim, but that has the disadvantage you need to remove it after printing, which is both tedious and hard to keep tidy. \n\nAlso, it is important to use both a small nozzle (0.25 mm) and thin layers (0.1 mm). A 0.4 mm nozzle has a hard time producing a sufficient amount of detail, and thicker layers will lead to a very grainy feel of the top of the keys.\n
Pm'd
You know I actually preordered that one about a year ago? I cancelled the order a few weeks ago since my current keyboard is slowly falling apart, and they are realistically not going to deliver for at least another 3 months or so. I can't wait that long anymore. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob_disease#Diagnosis\n\nTL;DR; There are symptoms, but no objective test as of yet. Since they are not going to do a extensive physical and psychological examination of every donor that walks in, they need a blood test. Which does not exist.
Also, 130 mm/s is extremely fast. Slow it down to, say, 30 mm/s, see what that does and maybe work your way up from there.
I have actually been wondering the analogous thing about when a star ignites. Is that something that happens suddenly, or is it a more drawn out process?
Nope, right now, you cannot donate if you ever had male gay sex. Or even if you are a woman who had sex with a man who had sex with another man. \n\nThese rules are being revised right now though. Sanguin did a survey just a few weeks ago asking donors how they felt about gay men donating blood.
On top of that, it's totally unbelievable Elysium has this huge fleet of mobile medical facilities just standing by. Why? They weren't going to help anyone on Earth, right? 
Yeah, it's heavily based on the MS Natural, which is of course _enormous_. I thought about several variants, including having the navigation cluster in the middle (either with or without a numpad). In the end I settled on a pretty conventional layout, albeit tenkeyless.
The hollow bottom would be tough to print. You can add supports there, but you'll have to remove them for however many track pieces you are going to print. Not fun.\n\n
You are wrong.
Fair enough. Thanks for the provocative thread :)
I am not in the US.
That a cloned human will be a mindless drone, ready to be used as the perfect soldier. Or, alternatively, that clones will somehow have a telepathic connection to their "original". \n\nActually, I think many people still believe this.
Also, even of you manage to design and print this the cup and tube will feel very different in his hand and mouth. I don't know if that is important to your son, but something to keep in mind.
Pulling post-it notes off of the pad. Yes, really.\n\nIf you do it like most people do, you hold the post-it at the bottom and pull it upward. WRONG! This causes the post-it to curl at the top, where the glue is, which makes it pull itself loose from whatever you stick it to. \n\nWhat you should do instead is pull the post-it downward. This requires more a bit more force, but the post-it will stay straight and stick a lot better and longer.
*one of the guys called me out for a syntax error*\n\nThat sucks. I always let candidates write code on the whiteboard, and always make it clear I don't care about syntax errors. It's your thinking I'm insterested in, and how you approach a tricky problem.\n
In één keer goed. Knap hoor :)
No, you will not be able to donate blood. There is no test to check if a person is infected with CJD. In fact, the only way to be sure someone had CJD is wait for them to die, slice up their brain, and look at it under a microscope. For this reason, they introduced a rule that everybody who was in the UK during a certain period cannot give blood. This also goes for Dutch people. When I go in to donate, I always have to fill out the same form, and it always includes the same question: Were you in the UK during this-and-this period? If you answer "yes", you will not be able to donate blood. 
Not sure what you mean by indent. The angles and spacing are almost identical to the MS Natural Ergonomic 4000
Yes, I think the palmrest requires some more work. Right now it follows the angular look of the rest of the keyboard, but that may not be the best choice for comfort.
Me too! Where can I get one?\n\nedit: Oh, except that it looks like it's not tented :(. I really like my keyboard tented.
Ah, thanks, I didn't remember the exact moment. That makes sense.
Maybe a bit, but with that height vs width ratio the maximum overhang is going to be pretty severe, regardless of the exact shape. This makes it hard to print. \n\nDon't get me wrong: It'll print, and you'll get something, but the surface of that overhang is not going to be smooth.
PLA should definitely not end up in your compost. While it is sometimes marketed as "biodegradeable", this should be taken with a large grain of salt. Although maybe theoretically accurate, the temperatures at which PLA degrades are rarely if ever encountered in real life. \n\nWhere I live, all plastics are separately gathered by the utilities people and then processed/recycled, so it doesn't end up in a landfill whenever possible.\n

I think I could have gotten used to the Matias Ergo Pro layout, but there was such a minimal difference in typing experience between the Matias Quiet Click switches and the rubber domes of the MS 4000 that I didn't feel it justified the price difference. \n\nAs for the more exotic layouts like the ErgoDox and Atrius: I can't imagine I'll ever get comfortable typing on those. They're just too different from the ANSI-type layouts I am used to.\n\nAnd I guess they're not split as in "physically separated halves", but what would be the proper term for keyboards like the MS 4000 if not "split"?
The unit of time, A.K.A "second", is defined in terms of specific behavior of the Cesium 133 atom. Within a specific frame of reference, this will always result in the same duration, of course. So the "speed of time" will always be 1 and dimensionless, as you say. \n\nHowever, when expressing the "speed of time" as you see it pass in a different frame of reference, shouldn't you consider "their" second to be a different one from "our" second? \n\nIf we are in frame of reference A, and they are in frame of reference B, then of course the second as measured from inside frames A and B respectively will yield the same result. However, if you are expressing the "speed of time" as proposed, you are comparing the second from frame A to the second from frame B *as measured in frame A*. So this should not properly be considered the same second, I believe.\n\nSo if the second in frame A is called [s], and the second in frame B as measured from frame A is called [s'], then the unit for "speed of time" would  be [s/s'].\n\n
You see how the orbiter lifts a little, even though the boosters are still attached to the launch pad? The designers didn't realize it would do that, and it led to damage to the boosters' nozzle which they only discovered after recovering the boosters for the first time and inspecting them. When they figured out what happened, they strengthened the boosters' bottom.
Well, there was a proposal in the US once to make it mandatory to enlist in the army for congressmen who voted in favour of war.
Thanks for the feedback. I think you're right. I'll try a curved palmrest, much like the MS Natural has. I just hope my 3D modelling skills are up to the task :).\n\nThe keyboard is pretty modular, so one option I have is getting rid of the middle part entirely, and using the two halves unconnected. 
Sorry, no can do. I've had my mk2 for a couple of weeks now and am absolutely loving it! 
I actually took some notes during my build:\n\n* Take your time, carefully read the instructions and don't skip steps.\n* Use the online build-guide instead of the printed one, as the pictures are way better\n* When installing the belt on the y-axis, pay close attention to the instructions. They flip the whole assembly around a few times in the pictures, which confused me.\n* The extruder is the most complicated part to assemble. Carefully measure the lengths of the screws to ensure you use the correct length in each spot. The square nut you insert in the beginning is only secured at the end and kept falling out. \n* Use the attachment point of the PSU holder to the Y-axis as a reference point to ensure proper spacing between the frame and Y-axis\n* Tighten your grub-screws properly! The XYZ-calibration kept failing on me because the X-axis pulley grub-srew was a little loose.\n\nand finally: Take your time!\n\n\n
Slow does not begin to cover it. I actually bought book 11 twice by accident, because it so completely failed to impress me that I completely forgot the story.

Thanks, that ties into what @Justinicus says above. 
There is no territory to claim on the north pole, as it is all ice floating on water. Antarctica is actually a continent (i.e. there is land underneath the ice). Since there is no land underneath the North Pole, strictly speaking the same rules would apply as for territorial waters (Such as "the sea up to this many miles away from your shore is yours. Beyond that, it's called International Waters") . Unfortunately, there are natural resources to be found on the bottom of the ocean floor around the North Pole, such as oil and natural gas. Therefore, nations are scrambling to find whatever reason they can come up with why this or that piece of the North Pole belongs to them. \n\nOh, and about Antarctica: It is split between a number of countries who have agreed not to drill for oil there. They all maintain a "scientific" presence there. In reality, these scientific bases are at least partly there to keep the claim to their part of the Antarctic valid, just in case the world ever decides it really needs the oil.
You mean it is surprising to you that it is the same star every day? In that case: No, this is not a coincidence. Earth's axis wobbles, but very slowly, so that won't have a large effect on short timescales (years). The same goes for Earth's and Polaris's movement relative to each other. Earth's orbit around the sun is relatively fast, but the size of that orbit is minuscule compared to the distance to Polaris, so it won't have a huge effect. This is similar to how the moon seems to move with when you look through a side-window of a car at night.

So when one of their engineers comes up with a new way of determining recommendations, they test it out on a small percentage of visitors, and if it leads to more sales they'll use it for everybody. \n\nApparently, in all these years, they have yet to come up with a recommendation engine that does a better job at maximizing revenue than the one recommending you vacuum cleaners for years.\n\nAs a counter-example though, my local DIY store has a loyalty program that tries to be more intelligent about this. So when I buy a few boards of plywood, the system will print me a discount coupon for nail or screws. And when I buy electrical wire, it will give me a discount on light fixtures.
Russia's leaders seem to be slowly going completely bonkers.
There's a few aspects to this question. \n\nFirst of all, given a tax system that allows for deductions and benefits, there will simply always be groups that benefit and groups that get left out in the cold. If there's a tax break for keeping your lawn nicely mowed, then guess what happen when you choose not to mow your lawn?\n\nOk, so why are there tax breaks, benefits etc? These are essentially how lawmakers try to guide society. Financial incentives can promote or discourage certain behaviors. You want to promote people driving a more fuel-efficient car? You can either tax fuel-efficient cars extra, or give owners of Electric/Hybrid cars a tax break.\n\nSo to answer your question: Because the elected representatives of your country decided that marriage and kids should be promoted and that the elderly should be rewarded for their hard work in earlier years. Ok, these may not be the actual reasons, but the fact remains that these are rules enacted by your government, which in theory fairly represents your society's mores and values. \n\nIf enough people ever vote for, say, a Libertarian party or candidate so they can dictate policy, you'll find these measures are probably quickly abolished. 
For what it's worth, I read somewhere Armada was actually written _before_ Ready Player One, even though it was released after. I thought that made sense, since Armada to me felt like either an incredible rush-job or a story written by an author-in-training.\n\nI did enjoy Ready Player One though, and am looking forward to the movie.\n
What I don't get is 1) where all the money goes and 2) why on earth they need close to 4000 people to keep it running?\n\nThey employ 3900 people, with revenues of over US$ 2 billion. That's over US$500,000 per employee, which is more than decent revenue per FTE, even for a Sillicon Valley company. So why are they still bleeding money?\n\nOn top of that, when all is said and done, it's not a hugely complicated service. Sure, you need some serious engineering-fu to scale a webservice to that amount of users, and you'll need a sales team to sell the ads that produce revenue, but I don't see how that requires even close to that many people.\n\nAll in all it just sounds like an incredibly inefficient company.
That's certainly an option, although it means deviating from the standard ANSI layout. Not sure how I would like that.
The Prusa i3 Mk2 is a serious update of the Prusa design, improving it in many ways. While I have no direct experience with the Monoprice, I do have experience with other Prusa clones, and the Mk2 is better than all of them. As PuffThePed says, the Mk2 outperforms printers over twice the price.
It's intended as a mechanical/TKL version of the MS natural, which is not ortholinear. Maybe if the mech keyboard bug really grabs hold I'll try ortholinear at some point :).

Yes, this. Ever notice how Obi-Wan calls Vader "Darth" when they face-off on the original Death Star, as if that was Vaders first name? Even the Sith didn't exist at that point.

When indicating the number "2" with their fingers, they will always stick up their thumb and index finger, instead of index- and middle fingers. This is because "index- and middle fingers" is the same as giving someone the finger.\n\nGot me into a bit of trouble when I ordered 2 bears in a bar.
After running 4.5 km with my daughter and 1.5 km with my son I finished a 1/2 Marathon in the Eindhoven Marathon event (the Netherlands) yesterday. Final time of the 1/2 marathon was 1:53:19, which I am very content with!

Awesome stuff. How many takes does it usually take to get "the shot"?
You can hand-wire a keyboard, no PCB required. Just a lot of diodes, wire and patience. See e.g.: http://i.imgur.com/0SQMKV0.jpg

Interesting you mention Ender's Game, as I would lump that in the same category as Ready Player One: A simple but enjoyable read. \nI liked Speaker for the Dead a lot better, for example. Everything by Orson Scott Card that is not Ender-related or -derived that I read is just depressing soap-opera by the way.\n
Hard to say for sure based on these pictures, but a couple of random thoughts: \n\nOne possible cause is under-extrusion. This can be caused by improper configuration, but also e.g. a contaminated hobbed bolt or hobbed bolt with worn out teeth. \n\nIn case of a direct drive extruder, one possibility is the filament is twisted on the spool. This makes it hard to unroll the filament, and can actually make the extruder (and hence the hotend) lift itself up a bit. 
The main downside with Cura is that Prusa seem to focus most of their attention on Slic3r. Point in case: When I tried the mk2 Cura profile I found out the hard way it does not preheat before homing, leading to the blob of solidified PLA dangling from the nozzle crashing into the bed. The Slic3r profile preheats before homing, presumably for this reason.
Thanks! I'm afraid I would miss the function keys and navigation cluster too much though :)
The print- and hotend-fan were only added to the selftest in 3.0.9, so definitely upgrade and try again.\n\nTo be clear: The hotend fan (the little one on the left of the extruder that makes a lot of noise) is not controllable. It is completely automatic and will switch on when the hotend goes over 50 deg C and switch off when it goes below that. So that seems to work as expected from your description (including the bit about it not switching off at the end of the selftest).\n\nThe print fan, on the other hand, is on a completely separate circuit and responds to different command. So that's why it's really confusing when you say the print fan comes on when the hotend heats up. \n\nAnyway, just go ahead and upgrade the firmware and try the selftest again. When the selftest asks you whether the hotend fan is running, please confirm the print fan is NOT running (and vice versa when the print fan is running).\n
Ok, thanks, that's a bit what I'm afraid of too. 
The opposite of that is "heterological" (meaning: Inapplicable to itself), which leads to the Grelling-Nelson paradox (Is the word "heterological" heterological?):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grelling%E2%80%93Nelson_paradox
Night's Dawn Trilogy by Peter F. Hamilton. 
Reminds me of the time I was browsing for something (I forget what exactly) in a staples isle. When I saw what I needed I bent over to get it. Unbeknownst to me, an old lady had walked up and was standing right behind me looking for something on the opposite side of the isle. When I bent over, I butt-pushed the lady head-first into the metal racking. She had a small wound on her nose, and was a little shaken, but otherwise fine. I was totally freaked out however, since I was pretty new in the US and was afraid I was going to get sued like hell. So after apologizing profusely and making sure she was really OK I high-tailed it out of the store.\n
And why does it move like it's handheld.
If it is a real mk3, then it should have a black side with printed text etc, and a metallic side. The metallic side is the print side, and you can print directly onto it. In fact, if your printer has (or will have) an inductive sensor for automatic bed tilt compensation, you have to get rid of the glass plate or it won't work. \n\nOh, and I can imagine the foil protects the metallic side during shipping. If so, remove it. It could also be thermal insulation on the bottom side though. That should stay in place.\n
Why not simply ask for a replacement heatbed then?

Well as long as you're not looking for anything too fancy, you can get your own [colored dye-sub DSA caps](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-sublimated-keycap-sets/)!
they are hard to buy new, but go to /r/mechmarket and there's tons
Can we just get some white or black PBT blanks for fuck's sake??
SP is producing sets for the pmk website from time to time. Regarding abs SA sets the machines are booked out for this year. So if you do a group buy now it will ship next year. SP doesn't have the machines to produce more and to be able to have sets in stock. 
ooo look at that 
Don't knock it till you try it! I found uniform caps very easy to get used to. It also makes the keyset much more versatile and nicer looking IMO.\n\nYour best bet is /r/mechmarket for the sculpted sets, though. It'll cost you a pretty penny either way unfortunately. DSA tends to be cheaper and easier to get a hold of if you just wanna try out spherical/uniform caps. All of these hold their value very well, so you could always sell those you don't like. 
SA believes that this market is highly volatile. In another economic recession, most of us will likely stop spending as much money on keycaps. Thus expanding production now to meet full demand would be foolhardy, as most of their production would dry up in a less prosperous time. Or so their logic goes.\n\nI partially agree with it. They should ramp up production somewhat though, so at least new group buys ship within 3 months.
dsa is not too hard to find but SA in the style you want/ with the layout you want is pretty hard to find\n\nif you want to find the SA set you want expect to pay a lot for it too
Yes, that's true, I forgot to mention. Still looks nice enough that it could tide me over until I can get a real sculpted set though...
Ice Cap is all row 3 though, which defeats the purpose of SA
I own a set of these and I would say they are worth it. Some of the keys are a liiiiittle bit crooked, but I'm not super picky. They feel and look great IMO :)
>hard to buy\n\nJust wait until you see older GMK sets, or get into the sad world of Topre keyset hunting (AKA spending $400 on HiPro)
SP owns the injection molding machines\n\nand the molds\n\npimpmykeyboard does make extras\n\nthey end up in grab bags
Not only that, but they plan to keep several keysets in constant production (although I assume from all the GBs right now, it might be cutting into their production).\n\n>As production time allows, we plan to keep the following sets in stock indefinitely:\n\n>Eve, Midnight, Deep Space, Green Tea, Dolch, Otaku, Quartz, Think Different, Jukebox, Hana, Granite, Stealth, Ice Cap, Industrial and Borealis.\n\n>[Pimpmykeyboard](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/whats-new/)\n\nRecently, Quartz showed back up and before that, Granite. They also have their keyset of the month sets every month, last month being G20 Semiotic and this month(?) [Uniform R3 SA Grade](http://www.keyset.design/).
[SA Ice Cap](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/) is currently in stock on PMK. Only in ANSI though, and dye-sub rather than doubleshot.\n\nI do wish we didn't have to wait for group buys though. I've been reading this sub for probably the past 3 or 4 months and I think I've only seen one SA group buy pop up in that time.
You're faster than me, this one came into my mind too :D
Nice idea. Do you have some pictures how this looks like with this strips? 
SA sets are hard to come by because the manufacturer, signature plastics, doesn't allocate the resources to consumer caps that it would take to satisfy demand. Why? Because they make a lot more money from their commercial sales I assume, and this little enthusiast keycap thing is just a side project. 
Why don't the enthusiast keyboard sites like WASD, mechanicalkeyboards.com, or even pimpmykeyboard (Signature plastics themselves) stock of these keycaps though?  They seem to be popular enough to always sell out.  If one of these sites sold SA keycaps and made them more accessible through their stores (instead of forum post group buys), or even on new keyboards like WASD does with their UV keycaps, I think there would be even more or a demand for them.  At least as much as there is for any of the other mechanical keyboard stuff.    \n\nI don't disagree that enthusiast keycaps are small potatoes for SP, but it can't be a very lucrative  business model for pimpmykeyboard when pretty much full sets of everything they have are out of stock.  Why not make extras during the group buy runs and then sell them?
There are also SA keycaps sets available on Taobao, but depending on where you are the ease of getting these will vary 
Personally I'd love to see WASD stock maybe like 3 colors of PBS caps. Been wondering, maybe I should send them a mail asking about it :)\nThey could effectively order an amount SP would be willing to produce.
Are the rows/caps having different molds than the SA ones? Can you take some pictures comparing the rows of SP SA and this clone? I bought a grabbag on r/mm with a T keycap with an unknown SA profile which i haven't seen before and i would like to know who produced the cap.
As you can see the inner part is black, the rest is white. Doubleshot keycaps are made with 2 layers of plastic, the black one with the legend and the white one with the cap. With this technique the legends can't fade within the years.  \nThese ones are old cherry abs caps (today known as gmk caps like the recent plum group buy on massdrop). These caps are very thick and have a high quality. In Germany they are more common (mainly because cherry is a German company) and these sets are worth 20-30€, with ansi it should be more, especially when the set is white and not yellow (abs plastic ages when being in sunlight for a longer time which makes keycaps become yellow). To make it short: the switches are shit, the keycaps are the best abs doubleshot you can find and are worth a decent amount of money.  \nIf you want to learn more about doubleshot (or this switches) you can have a look at this wiki: https://deskthority.net/wiki/Double-shot_molding
You could have a look at switchtop. 70 switches with international shipping should be ~28$
No colemak? :(
No idea about the switches but you could use Imgur for pictures ;)
A pen or a cheap rubberdome because he was poor /s
Update your flair :P
140$ is average and nowhere near 'very cheap'... 
Any split keyboard can do this. Else you could just look for a small keyboard (eg tkl, 60%, preonic)
You can cut the case by yourself. But apart from that there is no place to buy (except the atreus62). Sadly there is not such a high demand for atreus. 
He is a bit busy at the moment due to 2 devlin group buys. One of them should be shipping at the moment, with the other one he had to do all the refunds. If you give him some time everything will be fine.
I disagree, in Germany most post offices have cherry blacks boards. They were sold so often here that you can get those used for 1€.
Probably a poker with RGB
You can be lucky and pick up a bag from pmk or you could ask at mechmarket, some people have so many of them so you may get some for shipping costs.
No, no chance getting the space bar
I can understand their point but I am using 25 year old blues at the moment without any problems. I don't think that this is a necessary change, especially due to the problems with some keycaps.
Flair checks out
And pmk has dsa blank sets on their website
Go with orthlinear planck :P You will find all you need on a layer ;) With thumbs you toggle the layers and you will have all the numbers and function keys in your homerow so you don't have to move your hand for it. And you still have native arrow keys :P
With the Devlin problems, other issues around Christmas and January and now the shippment of skidata ukkeycaps was very busy in the last time. I don't think that this keyset is forgotten, it will come back when he has the resources for running this buy :)
Always keep in mind that most cherry boards with cheap laser engraved pbt caps have a different bottom row with Windows keys, with a 1800 board they have 1u modifiers instead of 1.5u.
Well i have a 'T' Keycap which seems to be a row 2 keycap. But the cap has another shape than the normal SP ones. So regarding this set: Is a row 2 key of maxkeys identical to a row 2 one of SP or do they have a different shape?  \nSry if i am writing odd things in your eyes, english is not my first language :/\n
Proper usb c cables have like 26 pins iirc. This is not easy for soldering so I don't think there is any diy or custom cable. 
Well they are popular examples. Take the donot cable keyset which is "spammed" here, it is around the same price range, as mentioned above Hydro is at that range. The current dolch group buy is at this price range. Terminal was a bit more expensive but they offered much more caps (eg planck support). The February gmk group buy on keyclack was at this range too.  \nI don't want to say that the price is bad, instead for some people of some nations it may be good. But this is not a "very cheap" price.\n\nEdit: and even plum at 250 sets was 149$ shipped across the ocean
None of them. Get a brand like coolermaster, ducky etc
Plum is at 129$ shipped across the ocean, carbon was cheaper. And most people are from the US having low shipping costs for most buys. So maybe it is 'cheap' for some few people living at the end of the world but for the majority of buyers this is only average. 
Taobao is always ordering minutes before the time ends. Eg at dasher you could see an explosion of orders in the last day, most of them were the taobao bulk order. 
Mainly quantity. I think you can get whole gateron boards for similar prices in China. If you order gaterons at taobao they are at like 14ct each + shipping/proxy fees. So the pricing is mainly a thing due to low quantity and import stuff. 
Size? 
Is there any update? Will it start shipping tomorrow?
Colemak user here, caps is my backspace
Without homing keys and row 3 profile this set is compatible to dvorak/colemak. So it's quite a nice deal for people using these layouts.
Buy a keycap puller for the next time. Without one alps switches are your worst nightmare
uniqey.net :P  \nBut that's probably not the website the OP was looking for :D
I don't like LEDs so i wouldn't do it.  \nThere are some people doing it, there was a post about someone doing it with rgb LEDs which was kind a mess. As long as you don't have a unusual layout i would invest the money to get a LED compatible pcb.
Sure, already send him a mail, Have a look at the post from this night, there are quite many people canceling their order.
I second the text frokost1 wrote. Additionally i wasn't only talking about the microphone activation, mostly you can put this at a number so that it doesn't activate when typing normally. But when you are typing/pushing keys and talking simitaniously you will record it with both ways.
Thanks! Will have a look at my wallet if i can join the drop :D
I thought about that too untill I got my first SP SA set with 1-2-3-4 caps. The T is not identical to any of them. The key itself has a rough texture on top and is doubleshot. So maybe SP has more row molds or there is a manufacture with other rows. Either way thanks for taking the time, I'll probably take some comparison pictures and post it on Reddit :)
With decent pricing, good international shippment and trrs jacks you should be able to find a good amount of buyers :)
You make me poor :( Definetly will buy one of those. 
It really depends on your budget. With maximum silent I would recommend qmx clips or the ones from zeal which are plate mount compatible (qmx only pcb mount at the moment, plate mount ones should come soon).  \nAs I expect you wanting to keep the price in a decent range I would wait for the new qmx ones if you want to build/buy a plate mount board.  \nFor now I would recommend a coolermaster masterkeys pro s with reds (they will be lighter than the blacks of your current board) and buy some o rings to dampen the sound a bit. Generally linear switches are not very loud when you don't bottom out the key. So if you touch type and get a feel for the point of accusation and don't bottom out anymore you will reduce the sound. Tactile switches can help in this regard but as you already own a board I assume that you know the feel of different switches, else get a switch tester :P  \nRegarding the caps: you can spend 20-250 bucks for an ISO de set, really depends on your wallet. As a cheap one you will probably go with a taihao ISO de set. 
As long as it says blue you are fine. The cadet blue keycaps are with grey and white letters. They should ship within the next 2-3 weeks, 7bit is doing everything alone so you should give him some time. 
Isn't this basicly the same as the Datamancer poker case on massdrop last time? Normally it comes without wrist rest iirc but the concept is pretty much identical. 
At ebay they go for like 8€, at 2hpc.de they go with ps2 for 3€, when ordering 20+ they go for 1€. Good source for black switches
Well depending on the country the hhkb jp is way more expensive and rarer to buy compared to a normal hhkb or a normal keyboard :/
You should get the orings from ebay with shipping from China, they will need ~3 weeks but they are only 1,10€ there.  \nRegarding the keycaps: taihao pbt ones have ISO de and some group buys have the possibility to join for an international set with ISO de caps. Keycaps have different profile and different thickness. All keycaps have a different sound, eg SA profile feels louder than cherry profile. You could do some research on this of it should be very silent or you could just buy whatever you like and what you wallet allows. The taihao pbt ones are good cheap ones but very flashy. There was a ISO de dolch gmk group buy which will ship shortly. You can ask at comuterbase (the German forum) if somebody wants to sell a set. Or you could join a group buy by yourself but this will take some time and will be more expensive.  \nBtw: trust me: öäü is by far not as important as the numrow :P
switchtop should have them in stock, shipping is pretty fast and affordable with dhl.
no, the lets split does not support leds.
I am keeping all my caps. Could be usefull of I want to sell a standard board like the cm one. And they don't need so much space compared to all my boards :D
They should be MX compatible. And this could be HAD caps (abs doubleshot) which should be worth quite a good amount of money with ansi layout
And 2 times going to customs + additional fees (up to 20$ per package iirc) in some countries to get your products.
With China proxy it hit the 1000 2 days ago :P International kit seems way too weak For the moment, maybe a proper ISO de will give it a bump, we'll see.
You should ask for a replacement key. The F and J are normally in scooped and normal version so that you can use one pair as homing keycaps.
Uniqey
As massdrop has r4 pcbs and you will have r5 ones soon. Is it worth waiting for the new ones or will there only be some small changes?
These colors are so horrible. First all the delay and now a complete other keyset. I can't imagine ukkeycaps picking 2 wrong colors for a keyset and with both faults combined Devlin seems to be a very bad company at the moment. If such a color fault happens they should stop after the first cap and speak with the buyer to change or cancel the order....  \nI requested a refund even if I feel kind of bad because it doesn't seem to be ukkeycaps fault. But this is just a way too big issue in my eyes
More like 48 function keys :P
This shouldn't be possibly easily. The legs of the diodes are goung throug the switch into the pcb, between switch and pcb is next to no space. I don't think there yould be any place to use wires. Additionally the solder points for the leds are hidden by the switch too, so most likely you would have to solder that from the back.
Could you share your sources? I would like to build some cables too and haven't found good sources yet. 
Chances are very low as there are hardly any boards using these keys. Some group buys had such keys but i dont know any cheap blank set.
Should be ice cap with jukebox crap bag mods, there are tons of these shifts in those bags. 
80%
What's the difference between these 3 colors and dasher with 2 colors? In the end most keycap designers are just adding some colors, only few designs have their own special keys. If we like a set or don't, it is just personal preference like everything in this hobby is. But I wouldn't say that a design is bad because I don't like it. Maybe it is nothing for me but this doens't make a design bad\n
The XDA set on keyclack was like half the price. I am understand that it was a good deal compared to DSA but regarding the "normal" price of XDA this was horrendously overpriced on massdrop. Additionally we know nearly nothing about quality control etc.. If this would have been at keyclack prices I would have bought a set but not at this price. 
Mx clears/greys are made for industrial use. They have a bit tighter stem so that keycaps can't Get lost during work. Especially signature plastics keycaps are sitting way too strong in these switches
Or qmx clips with pcb mounted boards. The dampening within the switch is only possible if your board supports switch too removal (normally only custom or pcb mount boards have this feature) or you would have to desolder the board. 
yeah sp caps must be horrible :/
Build a planck :D  \nHow do the keycaps feel? They look pretty nice
There is a 6x5 GamePad pcb comming on switchtop soon. I was thinking about trying to use it with one hand but as I type not enough I wouldn't be able to learn it could enough. So in the end I will have a board which would be capable for that use but I will only use it for gaming
Some days with my planck, pretty fast. Just stick to it and you will learn it and press the wrong keys in a normal board :D
Nice! Hope pcb and cherry switches will drop together to safe shipping costs :)
Love the rat picture :D Would like to have some rats/mices too :D  \nDid the same to my dell and the linear blacks are way better than the tactile ones.
Well blues can be bad for gaming if you play multiplayer gamer and you have a microphone that records all noise in your room (eg samson go mic and others). As blues are loud this may be recorded. But with most headsets you shouldn't have a problem.
This is a normal price for a used 1800. They have blacks and cheap laser engraved caps. If you want to try linears for cheap you can buy one. They are solid for use but not special
Same here. Without dsa there were some white/blue DCS caps (like raindrop, don't know how the set was called) or the abs taihao set which is currently on massdrop. Apart from that there are mainly vintage keysets. 
Sounds good but this is way too far away for me :'(
The keycaps are nice. If nobody can help you here you should post it at deskthority. They have an "identity this keyboard" thread and "vintage nerds" are more likely watching the forum than Reddit. 
Well gmk carbon had the problem that the international kit was announced after the normal group buy. I know some german people who would love to have gmk carbon but they haven't joined the main buy because of the lack of the international set. And when the international set dropped even some of them bought it hoping they can find a set on the 2nd hand market but even that is next to impossible. 
I don't know if they changed it yet but 2 days ago # and <> of ISO de were missing. This set is at ~240€ at the moment and if there are 2 keys missing for that price I can understand that people are not joining it... 
5 assembled ones (but the model M needs a converter, so 4 working ones at the moment) and 2 kits which needs to be assembled which will happen soon 
I really like it, it makes writing much more comfortable as you have to move your finger less than with normal shift. With my planck i use the right shift as a layer for german symbols like äüö and toggeling the layer is so uncomfortable compared to thumb shift. You should give the thumb shift a try!
You would loose the legends, wouldn't you? And normally you do this with pbt and not abs or am I wrong? 
I think the demand will be much smaller than the demand for letssplit. But as a kit with trrs jacks this should become quite a nice buy for preonic users. 
Not again... 
cheapest would be bus with 30+ for one way. But with a place to sleep it adds up to quite an expensive weekend for my monthly budget :/
Love the board :3 hhkb jp is probably the nicest stock board out there
Switches: switchtop, cheap kits: Aliexpress, other kits: group buys or massdrop (planck should come this month), resellers: eg planck/preonic at olkb, Ergodox, atreus (62) are all at stock in stores, or do it by yourself with a custom plate + case at lasergist or other companys. 
The Novatouch should be more silent but it will feel different. As far as I know it is discontinued and sold out so you will probably have to buy one in the 2nd hand market. I think that there is a modification to silence a Novatouch which should make the board very silent. 
I have shift as a thumb key. With a normal keyboard I am just pressing space all the time :D
The case looks really good, how much is it with shipping to Europe? 
damn, unlucky :(
Ah okay, question answered. 
Around 80-90wpm on typeeacer, with mx greens, on qwerty. On colemak on the same keyboard, i can just about type 30wpm (still learning, its so tough)
Get the bomb stuck behind that gate-door... never seen this before either
Noob question, but what advantage(s) do these bracketed sliders have over the normal + shapped sliders?
I use it in Word and other such programs to correct typos (pressing the menu key is effectively a right-click).
It is now! Although the keyboard is going at 70usd (60usd at lowest drop), and choosing MX Clears adds 45usd to the purchase...
Motherboards specifically don't support them. So I suspect no. Feel free to correct me AMD_*
AMD has the pro CPU ranges that should allow this. Not on Zen architecture yet (I hope, looks with squinted eyes at the back-doors.)\nSee: http://www.amd.com/en-us/solutions/pro/security-manageability (DASH)
Another find: PRIME X370-PRO BIOS 0504 <= this BIOS contains ECC strings in it's blob. Yet the specs only mention Non-ECC.
One Gigabyte motherboard currently has the * removed atm, waiting on ticket to get confirmation.\nEdit: GA-AX370-GAMING-5
There is something weird currently going on with GA-AX370-GAMING-5, first it said ECC supported, then all motherboard got their specs updated "(Operate in non-ECC mode)" but it seems to have been removed from the specs of the GA-AX370-GAMING-5 motherboard. Currently have a ticket open to verify this informaion, with a good chunk of luck this means it currently supports ECC.
Another find: PRIME X370-PRO BIOS 0504 <= this BIOS contains ECC strings in it's blob. Yet the specs only mention Non-ECC.
"Support for ECC Un-buffered DIMM 1Rx8/2Rx8 memory modules (operate in non-ECC mode)" Is currently in the manual, but not on the website. No confirmation on ticket yet.\nhttps://www.overclockers.co.uk/gigabyte-ga-ax370-gaming-5-amd-x370-socket-am4-ddr4-atx-motherboard-mb-554-gi.html lists without non-ECC mode, so there is a small chance the motherboard BIOS has been updated.\n\nOn 22 feb someone posted:"ASUS PRIME X370-PRO specifications now lists non-ECC memory only."\nhttps://community.amd.com/thread/210870\n\nSo it listed ECC, then it listed no-ECC, and now it's ECC again. This could be a good sign.\n
For those interested in the associated patch:\nhttp://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=044e7a414be9ba20826e5fd482214686193fe7b6
Suppose one could unpatch ones kernel, if it will work as it should, that's a different question.
There has been a request of this to Asrock with a negative reply.
You fail to see that some people might want to upgrade asap, but do not wish to compromise on ECC.
You can find some quotes on the internet and screenshot if you search for the model number and ECC.
TLDR: Memory is detected (+1 other board), ECC working on L1 and L2 cache, ECC is working "at boottime", ECC error reporting might not be present, Rowhammer test: system did not lock up and no errors where reported.
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=044e7a414be9ba20826e5fd482214686193fe7b6 <= has been disabled to work in more recent kernels with modern CPU's. (>=0x17)
Not for some on modern kernels see:\nhttp://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=044e7a414be9ba20826e5fd482214686193fe7b6\n\nYou might be able to unpatch your kernel and try. But I suspect there is a reason this was added.
Do note that it doesn't entirely fix it. However a properly configured system (IMPORTANT! according to some paper, many servers have this configured poorly) should be screaming with ECC errors allowing you to detect it.
Got a ticket open to confirm for ECC. No reply yet (submitted on Friday). Most curious part: it used to say ECC then non-ecc mode, and now the non-ecc mode has been removed (as far as I was able to gather).
I reckon they will not update the manual (often), so BIOS updates are more important in this regard.\nWhat's most interesting about this board: first the website said ECC support, then non-ECC mode, and now the non-ECC mode is gone. I have an open ticket @gigabyte, concerning this, not reply yet though.
Correct, with Linux you might be able to get away with ecc_enable_override at boot time, if this works on Ryzen (not a clue).
:D
Damn, is it really that much in Canada? That sucks.\n\nYou *could* probably work around that by buying a Realforce/going on /r/mechmarket.
I mean if you're in a 5 mile arena with a bear and a decent head start I could realistically see the chance to run, chip a rock to a blade point, and to slit it's throat in it's sleep.

Any recommendations for 60% cases for a semi-reasonable price? Acrylic, wood, aluminum, doesn't matter.
I would think it'd be a violation of Nike's Hyperfuse's copyrights, not GMK, considering they adapted the colorway *from* the SP set.

The Exent has a [group buy thread] (https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87213.0) with details. You can choose between the premium and basic kits, the only difference being the premium kit comes with stabilizers, switches of your choice, and a GMK keycap set. Keep in mind shipping is expensive, since it's coming out of Malaysia.\n\nThat GB closes later this month, and you'll also need to assemble it yourself. Don't believe MX Speeds would work, since they aren't sold individually, but there's plenty of switches to choose from if you buy the Basic kit and source the switches yourself.\n\nThe Terminal GB already closed, so it's a no-go for now. You'd have to wait for another group buy or buy it from someone on the aftermarket (which would probably cost more like $200). They're expensive because they're high quality keycaps with a lot of keys, small demand, and because it was independently managed without Massdrop. Some GMK sets are cheaper, Plum, which launches soon, is closer to $100.
Fullsize has greater space between arms. Ideally, you want your arms extending out forming two parallel lines directly from your shoulders when you have one hand on the keyboard and one on the mouse. Additionally, when your right hand (assuming you're a right-hand mouse user) moves to the keyboard to type or back to move your mouse, you want your wrist moving at a comfortable angle, not having to put yourself in a strained position to type. \n\nAs for having pains, any Ergodox will do, as well as the Kinesis Advantage, and Atreus. And make an effort to improve posture.\n\n\n\n\n\n
Yeah, I tuned into one stream, saw the classic P2P connection bouncing and said "fuck that".\n\nThere's too many good games with good netcode on PC for me to really be interested in a $60 P2P game

It's not really the same (not to knock on what you like, everyone is personal preference and what makes you happy makes you happy). Building gives you a lot of control over what goes into your board, and it's a really rewarding experience.\n\nI've never handwired, though, because I value my sanity.
Anywhere from $100 to $400.\n\nIt depends on layout and switches, mainly, but also on case/caps preference and potential extras.
Which pexon cable/color is that?
>Realforce\n\nThis guy thocks.
Honestly I would buy neither. There are better Topre boards out there (albeit none in RGB) and there are better MX RGB boards out there. Choose which is more important to you.
Comparing Blues to Topre is hard since they're a different beast.\n\nBasically, Topre is the butter to a typical MX switch's potato chip. All the pressure on top, breaking and unfolding into a smooth downstroke vs a lot more of a crunch-y, plastic-sounding experience. \n\nCalling Topre "just a rubber dome" gives the wrong impression, imo, as they feel vastly different than most membrane boards you'll ever use, but on a technical level, yes, they are rubber domes
>and maybe find a keyboard that's noticeably comfortable.\n\nMaybe look into ergo keyboards, like the Ergodox/Atreus/Kinesis Advantage
It really says a lot when the only positives you can spin about your switches are either half-truths, lies, or technicalities.\n\nAlso, when you can't even write more than like 2 lines for a strawman "skeptic". If you have trouble coming up with and refuting fake arguments, you clearly can't begin to handle real ones.
PMK sells a few sets directly. EnjoyPBT possibly. /r/mechmarket
"Who is Pulp Fiction man?"
Could also check if you can return, possibly.
Zealios are still the best tactile MX switch, wobble or no wobble.
Good aluminum/wood cases under $75?
TKL kits are several hundred dollars above your price point and are far more rare. Most kits are 60%, 65%, or 40%.
That is indeed yours. :D
First half (up to Where I'm Going) I'd peg as an 8/10. Leaving out the 30 second interludes, there's only a few tracks that aren't very memorable. Tokyo, A Fan's Mail, Jameel's Space Ride, Friend Zone, and Captain Stupido all show off this quirky/funny side, while Walk On By, Where I'm Going, and Them Changes all are somber and depressing. It hits a decent amount of notes, and it's fun all around.\n\nThen the second half hits, the quality of features plummets, the songs blend together, it starts to get boring, and you realize he is actually going to start 4 songs with the exact same *ooooooh* and it gets boring again. Cut down, the album would be a lot better.\n\nI think Eggmelon's 6/10 is fair enough, but his complaints about the static on the drums of A Fan's Mail and about Kendrick's flow on Walk On By are ridiculous.
Man, if only that would help me be *any* better at Invoker.\n\n
Any plans to make 1u novelties like this?
>B+\n\nWhat are your rating for other switches? For comparison.
The second "invoker" was a typo referring to the ability "invoke".\n\nThey also meant either "tri-dye-sub" or "tried dye-sub". I don't know if tri-dye-sub exists, never heard of it.
It's good if you have the self restraint to not let yourself fall into the traps of tranq snipers or bottomless resupplies, while also toggling off reflex mode and marking targets.\n\nOtherwise, it's too easy.
I get that Topre is expensive, I own a FC660C, but $105 for a numpad when a I can get a 55u for like twice that is kinda silly.
the GOAT
Nothing wrong with a QFR-i, AFAIK, but I seem to recall an LED issue with it. Try a Masterkeys, maybe?
PM'd.
R4 Zealios are more stable and wobble less than R3 Zealios.
That's some late 2015 early 2016 OCN sentiment which isn't even true anymore. The G Pro and G403 aren't spaceship-like in the slightest. Material quality is fine, miles ahead of Zowie (who constantly get a free pass for their nonsense).\n\nProbably the only mainstream nice brand that made any sort of comeback from the era of DPI-jerking/spaceships. Razer, Corsair, and Steelseries definitely haven't.\n\nIf we still lived in the era of the G502 and so on, I'd be inclined to agree.\n\nTheir keebs suck though.
People are fine with their keyboards, but dislike their keys.
/u/ripster55 for giving us so much keyboard science over the years.
Get a 65%, man.\n\nThat said, I've used Full-size --> TKL --> 65% --> 60% and never had problems transitioning.
How does it look?
Nah, time doesn't make it better. You should give it to me to "take care of". *wink wink*

Is widebasket's store empty for anyone else, by the way?
Topre isn't really very comparable to MX browns. They're a lot smoother, less wobbly, more tactile, and honestly feel kind of "buttery". I love them.
1. Dye.\n\n2. From another board.\n\n3. Artisans on /r/mechmarket
Really wish there were options for Topre keycaps. I feel like my choices are "buy another" or "deal with it". \n\nI really just want some white alphas for my FC660C
It's an ISO layout, really common to see enter keys like that outside the US. Occasionally you get ones flipped upside down and even wider (known as big-ass enter keys), which is rare but neat, if awkward to use.
Splitting hairs over whether a linear switch is better than a clicky or tactile switch or over milliseconds of downstroke is about as irrational as running your VoIP program on a separate computer to not hog that desperately needed 1% of CPU usage.\n\nGet what feels comfortable. Best way to find that is to order a switch tester, find your favorite, and go from there.
LSDSA
I don't believe it was mentioned but you also have a wider range of switch choices.\n\nAll the Gaterons and Cherry switches are completely open to you, not even mentioning switches that don't go on retail boards (Zealios, Aristotles, MODs, Invyr Pandas), vintage switches (vintage blacks, Nixdorfs) and custom made switches (Zealiostotles, Gatistotles, MODios).
The best way to learn is to sub/browse this sub, use the daily advice threads, and to not be afraid of asking questions. People here love answering them. The wiki has a lot of info and there's a noob guide on it.\n\nIf you want to know anything in particular, lmk
Ground Zeroes had no open world and had arguably better level design than MGSV.\n\nThe opened-up bases and areas surrounding them were what propelled the player agency forward, not the big empty stretches of land.

Honestly idk if 14x14 is a good size for a launchpad. The biggest launchpad-like device I've seen used is 8x8, and idk what you'd do about a keycap being far smaller than a standard launchpad button.
Hey, any photos of your matte wrist rests?
Well shit, there goes that plan.\n\nHow different are they?
>without any weapons\n\nThe point is that you'd be able to create weapons, like a sharp rock. Part of the human brain advantage.\n\nAlso, the guy did kill a bear by sinking his teeth into it's neck, so clearly sometimes it can work.
I just now realized it wasn't. Huh.
Personal preference, but Cherry profile is my favorite.
Honestly for all the things they do, I don't think they treat the community poorly. Sure, queues are long, but compared to companies/groups/people who can't even follow through on their own groupbuys or insult customers, they're at least above the median when it comes to treatment.
In retrospect, the world design of DS2 and DS3 seem to be mixed up. DS2 is about exploring an old, forgotten Kingdom, and there's a ton of nonsensical garbage and inconsistencies everywhere. DS3 is about exploring this melted-together stew of lands from different kingdoms that drifted together, and it's full of fairly standard medieval architecture.\n\nDS2 should have had the cathedrals and castles that filled DS3, while DS3 should have had the seemingly unrelated lands melded together
>Klink before Lord of the Game or I Want It I Need It\n\nBut why?
>The spring is entirely too week, Once the resistance of the dome is overcome, the key just collapses down\n\n1. The spring has no effect on the tactility of Topre switches.\n\n2. This is a large part of the appeal of Topre switches, high tactile bump, smooth on the way down.
Topre is godly, by the way. Just got my FC660C today.
/r/MouseReview is alright, but the Zowie fanboys are annoying. RJN is better than most mouse reviewers but fills his videos with a lot of junk (AKA a 30 second test of whether or not a 3366 will spin out; hint: it won't). OCN is hilariously obsessive, but Ino's reviews are top tier.
The FC660C definitely feels steady on my table, and doesn't slide at all. Should be heavier than the Pok3r.
I'd return it and pick up a Masterkeys or something.\n\nQC is a weird thing because some keyboards, no matter how well recommended, will have dying LEDs, and some, which are often complained about for their dying LEDs, work fine. It's a lottery, best you can do is buy a better ticket.
So approximately when will they be available? Not sure whether to get a lowpro or hipro case\n\nEDIT: is the photo of the gunmetal case? Do you have photos of rosegold and champagne?
GMK Carbon, GMK Hyperfuse, GMK Hydro.\n\nI know these were recent, but I missed out, okay? Besides, GMK keysets ALWAYS look better to me after they ship.
I'm excited!
>alternative text\n\nWouldn't this be an image, then?\n\n(I know what it is, guys, haha)
If you have carpal tunnel issues, I'd really recommend an Ergodox or some other ergonomic keyboard. They're expensive, but your health is worth it.\n\nAt least get a smaller keyboard. Full-size is hilariously unergonomic.

I'm not really willing to.\n\nI had to rma my last gaming laptop, and they refunded me a large portion of the purchase price (not all since it was 1.5 years ago). So unlike other upgrades I don't have my previous model to play games in the meantime.\n\nThis will probably mean I'm buying a processor over what I would otherwise, but the ability to buy a couple months early is worth, say, $100 or so to me. Plus, that $100 is going toward a CPU that will definitely hold up when I do an upgrade.

I'm unable to match your work with the $320 /u/Jrchbld , can you link to the specific card with which you got this price after discounts?
Sounds like you work for a nice company :).
Personally I'm a fan of outemu browns but not blues. The bump on cherry browns isn't pronounced enough for me, and I think the outemus are slightly heavier so that's good. They're scratchier but I'm willing to live with it.\n\nBut I was disappoitned by my outemu blue board. They're louder than mx blues. I find heavier springs less necessary on blues (the bump is stronger to begin with), so they lose that and then also retain the scratchiness.\n\nThey're still decent, and better than Kailh which is the other switch you'll find at this price point.
No, but you'd be paying (slightly) extra for freesync without any benefit. \n\nAt that level, might be worth it to sell the 1060 and get a rx480. Might still run you less than buying a gsync monitor.\n
iClickers are the more expensive version of this.\n\nI like how one mechE professor at my University does it. He sets up a line you can text an answer too, and then lets you take out your phone to do so in class.

Honestly, I think the summit was one of the best tournaments in many months because we got to see so much more of the "lower" tier players like axe (that is, ranks 6 - 20ish MIOM) in the pools matches. \n\nThough Armada has been playing amazingly, his dominance has made top 4 at Majors very stale these days. 
Another suggestion: You get a much better quality keyboard with the Ducky Shine. I highly suggest it over the K70 if you want a RGB keyboard.\n\nThe K70's days are numbered from when you get it. The coating on the keycaps will rub away over time and they will become slick. Except, you can't replace them due to a nonstandard bottom row. Now, they're numbered in years, but the Ducky is probably numbered in *decades*.\n\nOf course, $75 for a K70 is nothing to wag a finger at if the refurb means they replace the keycaps.
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE US DOLLARS.
Maybe give the last couple games a pass though.
Agreed, I know OP's point was about ME1 but this annoys me. It's probably the best game of its series.
Until very recently, Signature Plastics only does SA in ABS plastic. So you're kinda stuck there if you want SA.\n\nOn the other hand, the shine of SA lends to a retro look IMO. Which is almost a benefit. 
> There is always more than one way to look at one event. Was Lincoln like a modern Republican? I don’t think so personally, but my perspective on the matter doesn’t magically make him a modern Democrat. Likewise, are not aspects of Hamilton more Republican and aspects of Jefferson more modern Democrat, honestly, I could make a case for it. Perhaps the key to better understanding how things changed is to move away from labels, and move toward understanding we are one America who has no better ally in the world then our political opponents themselves. Did things change and evolve? Yes, certainly a Gilded Age politician is not the same as a Progressive Era politician. But, is this best summed up by “they changed platforms” or “they changed ideologies”? Lots of room for debate there.\n\nThis is true, but it is a much weaker statement to consider democrats now unlike those who supported the Ku Klux Klan as recently as the 1960s. I think this statement is easily justified, though as you mention, considering Lincoln a modern Democrat would not be justified.
Guys, K70s are good but not in comparison to other mechanical keyboards.\n\nI would highly recommend a Ducky keyboard over a Corsair if you're looking into the flashy rgb types of keyboard. Much better quality for your money.
> TBH, DA:I doesnt run nearly as good as people remember.\n\nWell, no probably. Still it wasn't too badly optimized, I played it on a gtx 260 when it came out. Hah.\n\nI'm probably waiting a while for ME:A, I might try to wait for Vega and see if its worth it. Might play ME:A on my xbox1 in the meantime (I know that's probably sacrilegious, but if it allows me to make a better gaming rig by waiting then I think that's okay).

> I'd advise waiting until March 2 because Ryzen, although it may not be necessarily cheaper, may be more "bang for your buck."\n\nI would still agree with this, but only because intel's prices may go down across the board (not necessarily, but I'm hopeful).\n\nThe lowest end cpu coming out in early march is the 1700 at $329. That's way out of OP's price range, even if it is "more bang for your buck". He'll either want to wait for the mid/lower end ryzen cards (could be a while it sounds like, at least another month) or get an intel card now-ish.

Yeah, I think it looks repairable. I'd just say, when you get it fixed and somewhat working, put it on board and don't intend to take it off for a looong time.
Yeah, payment systems always go down at the worst of times.

Staples online will apparently price match with Microcenter according to another thread on /r/buildapcsales
I'm afraid I don't know, not having gone through the process myself. I suspect it wouldn't affect cashback sites, since the interface changes when you order with EPP are minimal (the price is lower and that's about it).
Hah. A few decades off.
Damnit, I'm in indiana, but close enough to get to Illinois. Can't get it to work either way.
I'm actually not as huge of a fan of them as I thought. I like them, but I'm used to lighter switches so they wear my hands out over time. Hoping this will go away soon, I only added them recently.\n\nI'd probably put them above mx browns for tactile, but I recently acquired an old apple extended keyboard that has ALPS orange, and those are definitely my favorite tactile switch. I wish ALPS still made switches.
I'm jealous. Fry's and Microcenter within driving distance.
I see, now that makes it a tough call.\n\nEDIT: That looks to be the lowest price anywhere by at least $40, but it's in store only and I'm not that close to a microcenter.
Then slow down a particular part where you illustrate the technique, and speed up the rest of it.
Darn.\n\nChicago area?
I'd definitely suggest avoiding the K70 if you want a durable keyboard.\n\nBuild quality isn't great. Keycap quality is poor. The real issue though is that the bottom row is nonstandard, so once the keycaps wear out you'll need a new one. Mechs can last decades, but these keycaps will only last a few years before degrading.\n\nIn its place, I'd recommend the ducky shine. http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/page-en/ducky-shine-5/\n\n
Not that I don't encourage OP to pursue his preferred major, but that is far from a true statement.\n\nThe ChemE industry is down right now due to low oil and gas prices, but that isn't typical.
Hey OP. I previously had a laptop with a 960m. If you're still not sure if you're using the dedicated card, then I was able to switch that through my power options. You can get there by right clicking on the battery icon in windows 10. \n\nThrough this, you'll be able to edit a battery profile (which has options like how long you want the laptop backlight to stay on without human input), and one of the options should be for the graphics card. I would have to change mine from "maximum battery life" to "maximum performance" to use my 960m.\n\nWish I could give more specific instructions, I don't have the laptop anymore!
That's a nice Micro center deal. Actually, I'm in the market for something like that for roughly that budget. Would you be willing to link to it?\n\nMy personal perspective is that this deal is good (I was able to match the specs and the price at $900 plus there's the $75 discount for some people), and that the Micro center deal is better.\n\nEDIT: Is it this one? http://www.microcenter.com/product/467635/G313_Desktop_Computer If so, that's not an apples to apples comparison because it's in store pickup only. This ships anywhere in the US.
It's not my favorite, but I have a soft spot for it.\n\nActually, it was the first song I ever heard from ID. Not long after it was released back in 2010, some social media agency had a vote off between America and "Impossible" by my then favorite band Anberlin. It got smashed in the voting since Impossible is a better song, and Anberlin was more popular, but I kept ID on my radar.
Link to a video with timestamp! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vsx3df-51xg?t=6m
I think a fair view of the game lies inbetween those two extremes. Probably an 8/10 game. I'd put ME1 at 8/10 too, and ME2 at 9/10.
I can't help but be a little saddened by the Corsair. It would be so much more awesome if they would use a default bottom row. This wouldn't be so bad, but they compound the issue with lower quality plastic (the material is ABS plastic) that will "shine" after a couple years of heavy use (they will look and feel slick instead of textured). Since the bottom row is nonstandard, it will be hard/expensive to replace the set, especially the spacebar.\n\nThey're kinda like the Bose of mechanical keyboards. They're still awesome compared to a $20 keyboard, but they're not built as well as others for the same price. Despite that, they sell well due to name recognition.\n\nEverything else about this build is badass though.
>You might have heard your cat chatter her teeth while longingly staring out a window at a sparrow or squirrel in a tree. Sometimes accompanied by a chirp, squeak or faint cry, the chatter is thought to be an indicator of a cat’s predatory excitement and of her stress at not being able to get to the prize. Some claim the chatter is actually a mimicked bird or rodent call, but this is anecdotal at best as the hunting prowess of cats is dependent on silence and stealth.\n\nOn the one hand this makes sense, but on the other my indoor-outdoor cat does this once in a blue moon, and he seems perfectly content to stay on my bed looking out the window at the birds. He knew perfectly well that I would let him outside if he went up to the front door, so I'm no sure where the stress would be coming from.

Right, price is about the same.
> Pok3r RGB with Cherry MX Blues with Vortex PBT keycaps. Best keyboard I have ever owned, the keys feel amazing \n\nVery nice!\nCherry MX blues are my favorite switch, but I have some zealios on my mobile 60% keyboard since it comes to places with me that wouldn't approve of the clicks. \n\nFor those not in the know, Zealios are made by Gateron, the company reputed to make the best cherry Mx clones. They are tactile like mx browns but have heavier springs.
> Many years needed for a reasonable ROI\n\nTrue, though one advantage here is you will be able to sell the house at a premium whenever you leave. Might make it easier to sell depending on the market too. 
I only use them once in a blue moon, but they've saved me a couple times when payment systems go down. \n\nThey're cheap to get so no reason not to.
> It's CURRENT_YEAR\n\nlol.\n\nTrue though, I only have checks as a backup/for rent payments. Most of my landlords are a generation or two older and aren't really kosher with electronic payments. One of mine let me wire him though at least.
Yep, same here. I've started to root for Mango, M2K, Leffen to beat lower tier players that I generally like better (like Plup), just because I'm so darn sick of Armada Hbox GFs.\n\nI miss having PPMD :(.
And then Ryzen looks to be above their older standards too!
> except for the fact that it seems like devs never get around to that whole multi-core\n\nYeah, it probably won't ever be quite there, still I'm hoping.\n\nI also do scientific computing, and while my research group has our own dedicated cluster, it's still nice to test locally where you don't have to submit jobs and wait for your friends' tests to finish. In that case multi core is definitely more important. 
In comparison to top 1-5, which is why I used:\n\n> "lower"
> Something like THIS or THIS are good deals. This is just meh in my opinion.\n\nLike I say in my comment, there are better prebuilt deals out there but they're few and far in between. For what is available right now I think this is among the best, and it matches a price I can get from pcpartspicker building your own.\n\nBoth deals you link to are expired :/.\n
This is good timing for it now. AMD CPU's seem like a no brainer with the Ryzen announcement, but its necessary to wait a bit longer for those benchmarks to get here!\n\nSo, if we're waiting anyways... might as well use the time to our advantage with sales like this.
Man, it was cool being able to zoom in and see the precursor to my undergrad in Tufts college :).
I'm actually about to buy a new computer, for my midrange enthusiast budget (GTX 1070 level) an intel might still make more sense, subject to Amd's benches.\n\nEven if that turns out to be the case, I almost want to buy from AMD on principle now.
> PP needs to fucking come back so if leffen chokes someone will stop armada again\n\nI dunno, it's not like Hungrybox was close to beating Armada, but Leffen was a heck of a lot farther away with the 3 - 0.\n\nUnless you're referring to him choking with his set with Armada.
For those who need a prebuilt, this isn't a half bad sale. It's the best one I've seen on hp.com since I've been watching it for about a month and a half now. Historically there have been better sales, but they seem few and far in-between.\n\nKeep in mind, this isn't refurbished and is from hp.com directly. You'll get a full 1 year warranty.\n\nLink to the EPP program: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/jobs/retiree/epp.html . You may be eligible to sign up if you're at university and sign up with your student email.\n\nI almost bought this deal. I returned a omen 2015 laptop to hp that they failed to fix (3 attempts) in return for $1100 in gift cards to hp.com. I asked on the buildapc irc, and they convinced me to sell the gift cards (at a ~$130 loss unfortunately, but oh well) and build my own. Still I thought I would share this!
> Please rethink that "almost'.\n> \n\nTo be blatant, I will be buying a Ryzen CPU as long as the benchmarks AMD has published are verified as accurate by 3rd parties when the NDA ends in the coming week. I'm with you here!
I'm pretty sure the whole running for DNC thing was a publicity stunt. He needs name recognition outside of this district if he wants to pursue a senate or governor role. Which I really hope he does.

>You are in a though spot because you need to buy at such a pivotal point. Just be prepared to buy something and have it seen 50 to 60 dollars off in the next few weeks.\n\nYeah, I'll give it a couple weeks to try to minimize this, but I am indeed prepared to see this happen.\n\nAt some point, time is worth money.
> I've never understood this stance. If companies are doing shady stuff to get ahead of each other, why put myself in the way of the bigger one to try and help the littler one?\n\nWell in this case, I'm thinking of buying the Ryzen 1700. It's nearest competitor is intel's i7 7700k. The 7700k has a higher single core clock speed, whereas the 1700 excels more in multi core performance from what I understand and if the official AMD benchmarks are to be trusted (we'll get third party ones very soon). Single core is currently more essential for gaming, so there's where I'd be missing out.\n\nBut it's not a huge delta like it was for previous generations of AMD cards, so the pill is easier to swallow. I'm also partially suspicious that future video games will make better use of multi cores (some games like fallout 4 do already), so I think this might be a good move long term.\n\nSo, it's a mostly rational decision I'm slightly tipping with knowledge of Intel's tactics.\n

In that era, alternative mp3 players were the shit. They were way more affordable than iPods, generally had better sound chips (or so I was told), and extra features like removable sd cards/radio tuners.\n\nI understand why Apple got marketshare, they did it right first and nailed the look/interface. But, if you were willing to overlook those you got a much better device.\n\nThe other really nice device, though a bit before the zune, was the Creative Zen Vision M. 
Danke :)\n\nMy original intention was to buy a i5 6600k, but I made the comparison with the i7 7700k as the price points are closest.
> For a while we just seemed kinda stuck, and no one at Tufts cared enough to help us.\n\nSorry to hear about that. It sounds like you'd be in my year (class of 2016) if you just graduated but could live off campus at that point.\n\nI'm not sure what I would've done either. My landlord that year was kind of an arse, but at least he was pretty serious about the upkeep of the house. \n\nIt most certainly is illegal, but nobody cares to help students. The community seems more concerned about getting their 4 (or 3 now in the case of Medford) students per household housing code enforced in order to reduce noise complaints. Even though they claim it's to help ameliorate living conditions, that doesn't explain issues like yours.
I do, but venmo, like a check, might make for an awkward transaction. You have to transmit a varying amount of personal info about them (could just be a name, but I often have trouble adding people unless we're facebook friends), and the payment is public unless you disable it.
I'm not sure if anybody else is seeing this, but the current CSS still has an issue where my horizontal subreddit list at the very top of the page is cut off. No other subreddits with CSS causes this same issue.\n\nThis has occurred since the style revision, and the change to the Gaiden remake announcement hasn't changed it at all.\n\nI'll ping /u/Shephen in case it helps.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/jPdh6\n\nI'm also using RES.
I mean, more than 2 but probably not that much more. There's definitely a sweet spot, as your argument I think rightly shows that too many isn't great either.
> This is crap, I don't know why it keeps getting repeated by non-scientists.\n> Chattering is an instinctive distraction mechanism that cats use when they stalk pray like birds and rodents.\n> Small sounds make birds and rodents freeze in place and watch for movement around them. When cats chatter, they force their pray to sit still instead of wandering off.\n\nThis fits my anectodal evidence well. Seeing as my outdoor-indoor cat still chatters when watching birds inside, even though he's plenty able to go outside when he wants to (so no stress about not being able to hunt).
Maybe that's all he had on hand?\n\nIf someone came and saved my life, I only have $20 cash on me... . I'd try to write them a check but some people are humble and wouldn't accept that, whereas cash is more natural.

Mannimarco annoyed me in Oblivion, so I soul trapped him and enchanted some bound armor boots with feather (you could get it permanent by a glitch in early Oblivion), then reverse pickpocketed them into the ugliest orc I could find. \n\nNPCs in Oblivion will put on the best quality armor in their inventory, and Bound Boots count as the highest quality: daedric. So, the orc put them on and Mannimarco is eternally surrounded by smelly orc feet.
In the same way that FDR started the shift with a focus on social policies, LBJ cemented the shift by signing the civil rights act. The democrats lost the southeastern sates after the civil rights act, not before. \n\n4 years after the civil rights act, one of the most notable members of the southern democrats (or dixiecrats), Strom Thurmond, changed his registration to the Republicans. Though most in that faction would remain Democrats, their successors shared similar ideologies and were Republicans.
Yeah seriously... ND is really quite progressive.

I bought a pretty powerful (and pricey) laptop from hp before I entered college. My dad insisted I get a 3 year extended warranty, and offered to cover the price of the warranty. I agreed. Because of that warranty, hp is buying me a computer now and loaned me two laptops in the meantime.\n\nWell, fast forward just under 3 years and the wifi card is on the fritz. So I send the computer in. To my surprise I get a call from a Case Manager who tells me my computer has a battery issue and since they don't make the battery anymore they have to replace it.\n\nThere was a weird glitch on that laptop, that sometimes the beats volume rocker/button could get stuck and it wouldn't power on. You just had to press it and it would go back to normal. I think this happened and they assumed it was a battery issue. But I didn't tell them that.\n\nSince I decked out that laptop, I paid around $400 for a 256gb ssd. In 2012 that was only on their top laptops, and in 2015 it was still only on their top laptops. So they could only offer me a couple things as replacement. I accepted an offer for a $1600 gaming laptop, which then had it's own 1 year warranty.\n\nWell, the touch screen on that 2015 laptop never worked right. I sent it in 3 times on warranty to get repaired and they never could fix it. I got my problem elevated to a case manager who again was going to replace it. This time I just asked for hp credit so I could buy a desktop, and they agreed to $1100.\n\nI sold that $1100 at a loss for $970 through a gift card website (I know nobody IRL who's in the market and I was too scared to sell on ebay). I'll be making a gtx 1070 rig soon. \n\n[Here's the 2012 laptop configuration before a 30% coupon.](http://imgur.com/a/mKNQt) \n\n[Here is the 2015 laptop configuration.](http://imgur.com/a/TB5jb)\n

What are you talking about?\n\nThe only bad thing about the python is it's maneuverability (It's not terrible - with dirty drives it's just OK).\n\nAnd what do you suggest instead? Anaconda with C grade thrusters... wow, what a brick. Great advice.
Are any experimental effects worth the hassle?
What does Dazzle Shell actually do? "Reduce sensor acuity" isn't very informative.
I see, so you didn't actually do anything special :( I guess the recording is different on Vive then. Because no matter what I do with the game displayed on the monitor it always has terrible fov.
I know. I was expecting it will be in the Warthog price range, so around 350 EUR for the whole hotas.
thx
I'm rasing one from harmless and the wage increases by one for every rank. He takes 7 at master so I guess it will be 10 for elite.\n\nI don't think that money is the problem. The problem is I can't really take him to pvp because he will die with the ship.
I prefer standard PAs because of less time on target needed.
Charge enhanced all the way. \n\nIF weapon focused 5 was available, then you could consider it for pve.\n\nFor pvp you still want charge enhanced so you can boost all the time.
I don't have a [new model](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-NL/Hive-Guard).
You could tell him that directly. You don't have to make a reddit post to do that.
Where is a good place to get those kind of missions?
Yeah, Python with dirty drive isn't such a brick anymore :D
No, you don't understand. The patch broke it. I heard it is only broken for steam version though.
Got a Xiaomi Yuemi and I'm amazed how well it is made. It's heavy and it's metal :P The top glossy cover is also very nice. For $70 it is amazing.\n\nI also made a wrist rest from some cheap alder wood. \n\n
Man, I need your help. I am trying for weeks to make the fov bigger in recordings. How do you do that? \n\nI use Oculus Rift. By default, if I'm recording while in VR, the fov is super small and annoying. I tried to use the additional window described [here](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/43396-Oculus-Rift-second-window-(useful-for-twitchers-amp-youtubers)) but I could not make it any better.\n\nLooking at your other videos I think you are using Vive, but I don't think that makes any difference in recording.\n\nPlease share your settings.
That's why LCS sucks. The teams just do not want to compete internationally.
I think your best bet is Gladiator.
Is FAS just a weaker FGS or does it have any advantages over the other?\n\nEdit: I see that it's a lot faster so probably more maneuverable too. Anything else?
I would agree 2 years ago. Now watching another TSM vs CLG is just boring to me. But maybe it's just me.
It is better against NPCs. In PVP most players will get thermal resistant shields and then standard might be better because it does not overheat.
that was my point
120 euro in europe. And I live in Poland so that is not cheap for me :)
> Conda is better than a Vette in some situations\n\nDude, what are you smoking?

Of course I change some things for mining (prospector limpets, rafinery and mining lasers), but for everything else this is my build.
That depends on a headset. The scale is perfect in Oculus Rift.\n\nEdit: I see that Vive owners are downvoting me, even though the problems with scale on vive are documented. Typical.
What's the point? He will answer like he always does. "You will know soon". He can't tell you anything more than you can see on the website.
Here you go:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/JcdOU
No, you are wrong. First they were 100% thermal + additional 20% kinetic. So they did more damage than regular.\n\nNow they do 100% thermal (actually 95% damage of regular because of -5% rate of fire)
Try to update USB drivers or plug the periferals into other sockets.
thanks
You have 2 options:\n\n- RMA\n\n- Cut the led wire: http://www.wikihow.com/Disable-the-Green-Light-on-a-Thrustmaster-T.16000M-Joystick
It's still faster to destroy the skimmers with dumbfire rockets.
FAS if you have the rank.
>I seen you put the descriptions for all the engineer mods on everything thats awesome of you.\n\nI use EDMarketConnector, it exports your ship with everythig. I didn't have to set anything manually.\n\nI use a python for farming mats because I think it is the best multipurpose ship (I don't like a conda, it's big, slow and can't dock at outposts).\n\nBest way to farm mats for eng is to first plan it out and then farm everything at once, you save a lot of time. Choose the mods you want, put them into [collector drone](http://collector-drone.one/#). I think 9 rolls for every module is enough to get a great ship and it is not a grind at all (3-6 rolls for repetetive modules like shield booster).\n\nFor combat zones be sure to use limpets so you can get the loot fast. Also always stay near your allies and attack the same target they attack.\n\nAlso you don't need to get grade 5 on every module (basically grade 5 is only mandatory on overcharged and rapid fire because of jitter). For example I don't want to farm Imperial Shielding, so I only got grade 4 Resistance Augmented shield booster. The difference is small.
thanks
I see, thanks.
Can you point me to a high end hotas then?
No.
Next time press Alt+F10 to make high quality screenshot.
Xiaomi Yuemi with TTC red switches. I got it from banggood for $70 as it was discounted (20%).\n\nI love the build quality. Everything fits perfectly and looks very solid. The white glow is also very nice.\n\n
Hey man, after your first two shots I thought I was done for. I had like 1% shield left. Those frags deal crazy damage.\n\nIs it common for FDL to run without SCB?
2000 users requested it on massdrop. I don't know how many of those would really buy it but I'd say that's a significant number.

I have Dispersal Field and Target Lock Breaker on the medium ones (although corliolis does not show the former for some reason).
That's not very optimal. 3 resistance + 3 heavy duty is way better. After 3 resistance boosters the diminishing returns are not worth it.
Jesus this guy is bad. Zero situational awarness.
Let's just agree to disagree :)
So how much did it cost?
I want that chair!
No. It's just how it works. He is not allowed to give us any additional info.
First of all not all weapons have different penetration. PA has 100 penetration in all sizes.\n\nSecondly many times you don't care about penetration because often the fight is over the second you drop the shields. For example if you have pack hounds to destroy the modules.\n\nYou value penetration waaay to much.
I think you are missing something ;)
It's really good. You will not get anything better at that price. 
But... they are not OP.

Could you please share your wisdom? In what way is she better? What secret does this build have?\n
There are many like it, but this one is yours.
Where did you get those arms?
OK I was waiting there for about an hour and there was no blockade. Only traders going back and forth.\n\nI was told there would be cookies
That's super expensive. Oh well, I guess it's not for me.
japan...
This looks amazing. I hope the price will be reasonable.

I am using gladiator + TWCS + Oculus Rift and I have more than enough buttons for Elite.
Looks to be crazy expensive. Throttle and pedals are usually more expensive than a stick so we are probably looking at almost 1000 euros.\n\nI know it is top quality and a niche market but I don't see myself spending that kind of money on a hotas.
Except Corvette has a lot better gun placement so realistically you will get more dps in a vette. Unless you are fighting another big ship and can keep it in your sights.
Thrustmaster FCS Hotas\n\nor\n\nGladiator joystick + Thrustmaster TWCS Throttle\n\nRemember to get a joystick with twist axis. You will suffer without it in a space sim. Don't let those pro aircraft pilots tell you otherwise.
I removed the link.
Just make an armory module that can store ammo. I cannot believe this is not a thing yet. How the hell a Corvette carries the same amount of ammo as an FDL? That's just stupid.
I had my throttle in the blue zone the whole time. Not that it matters since I was boosting constantly.
Why repost it?
Hardpoint placement is something many people don't take into consideration and it makes a huge difference. Corvette has great HP placement compared to a conda.
Do I need touch to play it?
For me it does not start in VR. I have to go to options every time I launch it and specifically pick HMD.
Yes but only against hull. Penetration vs hardness.
LOL you are silly. I have a pc and ps4 so I don't care about your "wars". This was just a reminder that pre orders hurt the consumers but I guess this subreddit is just to stupid to understand this. Go pre order another no mans sky lol.
Too bad it's a shit quality. Any yuoutube mirror with good quality maybe?
Excuse my noob question. You have a faster and more maneuverable ship. Why are you jousting him and throwing away all your advantages? Unless I don't understand something.
Efficient beams look the same and are actually usable.
You are wrong. Not sure about all weapons but looking at fixed multicannons:\n\nH: 28 dps\n\nL: 23.1 dps\n\nM: 15.6 dps\n\nS: 8.6 dps\n\nSo Huge is only 3.26 times stronger than small.\n\nEdit: Checked beam lasers - huge is 4.2 times more powerful than small.
Is it possible to buy this (or similar) board anywhere? Or was it only on massdrop and now it's unobtanium?\n\nI don't care about leds but I need a split keyboard with normal layout (so no ergodox) and wrist rest.
Jesus Christ. I would kill for that board.
http://i.imgur.com/tNdf9SD.png?fb
Incendiary does not deal "the same damage to hull". It deals thermal damage, so it depends on the target resistance to thermal. 
Yeah, so where's the video?
There is no VKB hotas. Only joystick.
No. Max is +179% (without secondary). The plus is important here. So the boost goes from 20% to 55.8%.\nBut with secondary you can go higher. I have a booster with +210.54 which gives 62.1% shield boost.
Will there be a tournament (a bracket)? Or just random duels? How do you check if someone has an engineered module?
If you really want the most inefficient weapon imaginable, sure, why not.
I don't understand this business model. There is a large demand from what I can see and the product is unavailable. Do they not wan't to make money?
Well, I just wish he accepted help.

Miami Gators maybe? Not Miami as this board knows it.
> Miami Gators\n\nHah this would make so many fans super salty. 
🤔\n\nMy heart says yes but my wallet says no. \n\n
Seems like you focused on that  crack instead of the center? Dope ass cap though, i love the translucent piece. 
🤔
🤔🤔🤔\n\n
Ooo, should I consider this a vote for a Gulf Racing Livery based keyset?
That's the kind of artisan I'm looking for. All of the blob animal things don't appeal to me at all... This looks like it was made for a keyboard, not just something *on* a keyboard.
Ahhh that makes a lot more sense. 
This was actually one of my personal favorites and all along I thought it was based on the Gulf racing colors. 🤔
Blue is too light for the Florida Gators. Maybe the Miami Dolphins but then again. Its a light blue and not a teal.
Finally, someone else. haha. I get the draw to artisans, but so many of them look *too* hand crafted? Or just messy and blobby.
That's still a yes in my book. Can't wait for those R2 basts to show up, super stoked for 'em by by the way :D
There are a lot like that. I suppose that's why the really sharp-looking ones like Snappers and Fugu are so huge right now.

Alright man, no problem.
This is a comment on your comment that verifies you've won.\n\nPM me the e-mail address that you'll use for your battle.net/blizzard account. :)

I don't. They just ship from there. :)

Any of the available colors for the other components can also be used for the lens.
Just message me if you have to make changes.
Yup! The next iteration shouldn't have clearance issues. \n\nAs for rubbing, I'm not yet sure. Waiting for feedback. The other one I'm worried about is SA. 
<3
They look nothing alike apart from the layout.\n\nClueboard's sides are convex, whereas this is flat.
Hi! Yeah it did. \n\nHowever, your Bastion's going to be part of the second batch.\n\nETA for this is TBC, but most likely mid-January to avoid partially inflated holiday-season shipping costs. 
It seems like no one from Canada has gotten theirs yet. I'm not exactly sure why it's taking this long. \n\nDon't worry though, I'll be sending replacements in the event that they get lost forever.
Out of curiosity, is that just the in-game model's head placed on pedestal?
It's not the stem, it's an issue with the chin piece.
Ivory is Beige. But it's not the grayish-beige, it's closer to white. 
Ayyyyyyy, nice article. The only critique/suggestion I have is that if it's for publication, text alignment shouldn't be justified. But I guess it's still up to the editor if he/she wants it that way.\n\nAlso... *Very early next week. \n\n*From there, US orders should get theirs within the 2-5 days. Or however long it takes USPS to deliver from California.*\n\n*Everyone else should get theirs within 8-10 business days depending on location.*

Welp, prepare to spend every paycheck on keyboards now. :D\n\nCongrats on winning the giveaway! 128 was the second number to have a match. PM me the e-mail address you use for your battle.net/blizzard account. \n\n
Yours is the beat to shit looking one right in the middle. :D
It's weird seeing them in pictures that I didn't take! Hope you're happy with them, please take care of my little friends. 😊
But senpai, I did see his comment. :)
They'll be available in limited quantities on my website when it finally launches. \n\nI haven't touched that in a while though. Might just use a CMS like wordpress just to get things up and running. 
I'm not so sure yet, the primary reason is just to get to the level of detail and refinement I want.
There's no need to be ashamed about that 49 wpm. Because that 49 just secured you a copy of Overwatch! Another dude had 49 but didn't follow instructions. Congrats!\n\nI already know your e-mail since your part of R1, but PM me the one you plan to use for battle.net/blizzard account.\n\nCheers man.
The configuration you chose should be in your invoice. But seeing as you can't remember what you ordered, I'll just make yours a rainbow colored one. :D
Unfortunately, you're going to have to make one form for each. Sorry about that.

**Bastion R2**\n\nHi there! Just wanted to give everyone an update on what's going on. I had hoped that my website would be up and running at this point, but that sadly isn't the case. So it's back to  good old reddit for updates. \n\nIf you don't want to read the wall of text here's [the extras order form](http://bit.ly/BastionR2ExtrasOrderForm).\n\n\n***\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Ok, so what's changed?** \n\n* [Comparison between V2\\(R1\\) and V3.1\\(R2\\).](http://i.imgur.com/emifV7a.jpg)\n\n* The whole thing has been[ re-engineered](http://i.imgur.com/2vM85rV.jpg) so that it no longer relies on adhesives to keep itself together. \n\n* I've also separated the frame from the stem which means you can now [customize the frame's color](http://i.imgur.com/iccgP29.jpg). Previously it was only available in white or black as I wanted to avoid over-painting that area.\n\n* The Lens/Eye and the stem are now in one piece, this theoretically improves the light piping feature, if that's your thing. :)\n* **You can reconfigure it now**. **An incentive to those that configured more than 1.* \n* There are tweaks to the available [colors](http://i.imgur.com/HA8rMcN.jpg). \n * Dark Gray replaces Black. Currently considering metallic gunmetal gray as additional option.\n * ***New colors***: Acid Green(Lime), Pink and Navy Blue(Dark blue).\n * Purple will be less blue-ish and more red-ish.\n\n* Semi-gloss and ultra gloss finishes have been discontinued as not very many people chose either of those 2.\n* Pricing for the custom color schemes are now fixed, as evaluating each and every one of them was a tedious and time consuming process I did in R1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Clearance woes.**\n\n**TL;DR:** [R2 will come with 2 chin pieces](http://i.imgur.com/C1CA3cU.jpg), one for displaying and one for actual use in case you have clearance issues.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are some units in R1 that has the chin piece hitting the key below it. This is primarily because of the chin not sitting flush to the frame. Due to the way it's [assembled](http://i.imgur.com/JR4DmSc.jpg) the peg that connects the frame to the chin sometimes doesn't let the chin be where it should be. The other reason was because I made the mistake of only giving it ~.1mm of wiggle room even in an ideal scenario. I had initially planned to just make the chin [smaller](http://i.imgur.com/EZykbYv.jpg). However, it looks disproportionate and ruins the aesthetic, so I've decided to just include 2 of them that you can swap out. One would be for displaying and if your layout has enough space for it and the other is for when you have issues with the key interfering with other keys.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ETA?**\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q2 2017. *Work sucks I wish I could just keep making Bastions all day long.* 😢\n\nProduction starts, possibly within the next 2 weeks or so. Just like last time, I'll have semi-regular updates.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**You already configured one and want to make changes?**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select *"You're here to make a revision"* in the [order form](http://bit.ly/BastionR2ExtrasOrderForm). Because it has been a while since you guys filled in the original order form, I will start invoicing*(with a long due date)* as a way to confirm your order and to avoid confusion. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n**R1 REPLACEMENTS**\n\nSomething wrong with your Bastion? [Just fill in this form.](http://bit.ly/BastionR1Replacements)\n\n**ORDER FORM**\n\nThe order form is [here](http://bit.ly/BastionR2ExtrasOrderForm).\n\n**3D Model for the regular keycap?**\n\nI'll be releasing that when I've completed all of them, potentially along with a tutorial of sorts as it realistically only takes about 4 minutes to make it.\n\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's all for now. If you have questions, just message or e-mail me. :)
No :( It ships with R2 as well. ~April/May\n\nThose that ordered more than 1 and had a unit that had paint issues*(I believe there were four of you)*... Well, I've decided to not just ship the non-defective ones first and then have the rest follow because I thought it would be best to just re-make all of them using the new and updated frame that I've discussed here in this post.\n\nThe reason for that is while the overall silhouette is very similar it's not exactly the same.\n\nIf you'd like to refund the standard one as well, just let me know.
You're in R2. :)
Are we going to be the meme team?
It is indeed OEM profile.\n\nIt should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/o2PhDh3.jpg) and like [this when bottomed out.](http://i.imgur.com/7Wr2qcx.jpg)\n\nIn any case, the clearance issues that are present on some units of the first batch shouldn't be an issue on the second batch.
D:\n\nNever knew I ~~wanted~~ needed a 65% board until I saw this one.\n\nWill the matte black's chamfered edge also be matte? And are the aluminium tops interchangeable? 
Hey man, invoices for the first batch and those that are on the top of the list for the next one have been sent out.\n\nYou're most likely in the second batch. ETA for this is mid-January to avoid potentially inflated shipping rates due to the holiday season.\n\nSorry if I couldn't do everyone's Bastion in one go. 
You're in R2. 
Fear not! If all goes well, I'll be express shipping Canadian orders in bulk too, then redistribute from there. 
Indeed! I wish I had more than 24 hours in a day.\n\n*Oh and btw. That's the part count, not the total number of them. I'd probably die doing all that if that was the case. >.<*
Hey man...\n\nFirst of all, awesome username. Second, apologies for the delayed response. Third... Yes, you're in R2.
Sorry for replying to this late. I didn't get an e-mail notification for this.\n\nAll non-defective R1 Bastions have been shipped.\n\nUnfortunately, yours was part of the affected units that I described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5p5wdg/photos_bastion_r1_update_finally_shipping/dcolzrc/).\n\nYou'll be getting yours along with R2. If you want to make changes to it, just let me know. Alternatively, if you'd rather just get a refund, also let me know.\n\nCheers. Sorry again for not being able to reply to this sooner.
You didn't win the game, but I'll PM you about the other one. :)
If I'm not mistaken yours is actually the one on the bottom left corner similar color scheme but orange sides.\n\nAhhh, camping the mailbox, like a true bastion main. Yes, it should get to you within the next few days.
Thanks buddy.
Yours is fine, pretty sure it's the BB-8 themed one. [Rightmost Bastion in this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/0jXaQJp.jpg) :)
No buddy, you're in R2. You're also near the top of the list for it, so if someone in R1 cancels, I will start giving their slots to you guys.\n\nI haven't gotten around to messaging people individually. Primarily because you can't message multiple people at the same time with the same message. >.< 
Thanks man!\n\n[You're part of R2 though.](http://i.imgur.com/H6WECGP.jpg). Unless you don't want it anymore :P\n\nInvoices will be sent out when I have the time to organize them. Or I'll probably hire someone to be my spreadsheet slave.
You're in the second batch. Apologies for not having some sort of confirmation e-mail. 
Outside giveaways, this is probably going to be the last one in a while.
This is a comment on your comment that verifies you've won.\n\nPM me the e-mail address that you'll use for your battle.net/blizzard account. \n\n*PS, totally didn't pick you because you were the first one to comment :P*\n\nPPS, nice cables man.
I'm glad you like it man.
Depends where you are man. But anywhere from 10-20$.
[Yeah, it didn't look like that when it was still with me.](http://i.imgur.com/5P6JkcU.jpg) [Second picture](http://i.imgur.com/lhO5EOS.jpg). *The tiny little specks are dirt/dust.*\n\nHowever, this is the second ultra-gloss Bastion that's had its topcoat shrink and crack, so I'm just going to assume that particular finish does not like the temperature swings it was exposed to during transport.
It also doesn't help that your username is pumpkinbundtcake. D:

Soon. Not Soon™ soon. Just soon. Packaging related items were supposed to arrive earlier this week, but they didn't. I was hoping I would be able to ship them on the 20th so they arrive at/on Christmas day, but that sadly didn't happen. *Ditched the original packaging for a larger one since it didn't have enough clearance for all the bubble wraps. Will be replaced with foam for R2.* \n\nUnfortunately, I'll be away for a few days. So even if it arrives this week, I wont be able to ship them until next week. Sorry 😢😢😢 T_T\n\nHad it arrived yesterday, I would have been able to ship them out before I left. 😢\n\n**Which batch am I in again?**\n\nIf your invoice reads ~~1xxxxx~~ 001xxx or 15xxxx, you're in the first one.\n\n***\n\n**R2/Second batch**\n\nI haven't forgotten about you, it's still happening.

Thanks man.
PM'ing you your tracking number. \n\nUSPS says it's out for delivery. So I'm assuming you're going to get yours within the day.
Nope. :)
Next week (hopefully) :)
CATCH PHRASE!
Woops sorry about that. D:\n\nThanks man.
:D\n\nHope it gets to you safely.
Beep boop
Confirmed
:(\n\n
I heavily underestimated the time I would need to cut bubble wrap, sort the Bastions and put everything in their proper packaging. \n\nGot back home last Sunday thinking I'd be done in a couple of hours and ship them all out the next day. I have never been more wrong in my life. It was a very busy week for me too, so I could only do them at night.\n\nApologies for all the delays.
Yours is fine. [If I'm not mistaken it's the rightmost one in this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/L5BrGHN.jpg)
**HOLY SHIT! Many centuries later, u/haxoroo finally finishes QA/QC-ing and wrapping the Bastion army!**\n\nShipping starts today/tomorrow(depends on your time zone).\n\n***\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**First things first**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I sincerely apologize for all the delays*. A lot of things did not go according to plan. By a lot, I mean erm, all of them. 😢\n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Some not-so-good news.**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White-framed Bastions have been deferred to R2. To cut the story short, paint reacted negatively to the top coat. (Do NOT click this if you have Trypophobia/ Fear of holes) [Picture here](http://i.imgur.com/sHtnWmk.jpg). \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, I am still not sure if it's incorrect thickness and viscosity or left-over wax that caused this.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice this prior to my holiday trip and couldn't inform you sooner. I also didn't have enough spare components to make completely new ones. Some light gray and ivory parts were affected by this as well. \n\nThe only good thing I can tell you is that your new Bastions will be built on the R2 frame, which has some slight improvements. I will contact everyone affected by this as soon as I'm done organizing stuff. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n****\n&nbsp;\n\n**R2**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-production has already started but delivery/fulfillment date has been pushed back. They will most likely be injection molded instead of printed this time. I find that even with industrial grade printers, they're still inconsistent. It's going to be nearly identical on the outside but the frame has been tweaked so that it doesn't rely too heavily on the adhesive to keep itself together. Will update everyone once I get the prototypes.\n\n*Those in R1, this isn't a ha-R2's-going-to-be-much-better! kind of thing. This is more of a I just made a lot of them and I felt like some things could be improved. I'll try to make it up to you guys in the future.*\n\n&nbsp;\n****\n\nThat's all for now. ^^^I ^^^have ^^^to ^^^go ^^^to ^^^bed.
It's a different sculpt, but the G403 would be closer to the 502.\n\nEDIT: To add to this, if you didn't like the hump of the 502, you might like the 900 because it's less pronounced/shorter.\n\nIf you did like the hump but think that the slope down on the buttons wasn't enough then the 403 is better suited for you.
Done.\n\nI've refunded the custom one.
Yes, [here's the form](http://bit.ly/BastionR2ExtrasOrderForm).
Oh wait you're right. I've gone crazy. 
I'll PM you once I'm done with other logistical things.
Beep boop! [ 92's the first random number to have a match](http://i.imgur.com/7DEKTrS.jpg) and you were the first dude(out of 5) to post. Congrats!\n\nPM me the e-mail address you use for your battle.net/blizzard account. :)\n
PM'd
:D\n\nYours is the only white-framed Bastion in R1.
Late October. Technically, there's only one round split into 2 batches. 
It makes it easier to read IMO.\n\nAlthough full disclaimer, my magazine knowledge is limited since the only magazines I actually read or have read are Top Gear(UK) and 3D World. Both of which I only own digital copies.
You're part of the second batch. \n\nInvoices will be sent out once I'm done with the first batch. As for that, it's 90-95% complete but I'm still waiting for the packaging stuff.\n\nCheers.
Hey man! \n\nIt seems like the chin piece doesn't sit flush on yours. *The cement that binds them together should have fully cured by now so don't attempt to fix it as it will break off.* \n\nI'll send a replacement along with R2. It's one of the things that I tweaked. [At the moment, the clearance when bottomed out is ~.1mm](http://i.imgur.com/7Wr2qcx.jpg). In retrospect, that might have been too tight as some keys aren't exactly 18x18mm, it's usually 18.1~18.3mm and the peg (.25x .1x.175mm) that connects the frame to the chin sometimes doesn't allow the chin piece to be where it should be.
[This one?](http://i.imgur.com/Ohqr0zL.jpg) \n\nDo you want me to give it a darker shade of blue and teal sides to make it match?\n
Unfortunately, yes you're going to have to submit another form.
Thanks man! Oh and you're part of R1.\n\n
Hey man,\n\nYours will be part of the second batch. ^To ^be ^more ^specific ^yours ^is ^number ^316\n\nETA mid-January.\n\n
Just checked, you're part of R2.\n\nETA: Early February.
isn't that the joke though? "mods are asleep, post [content not directly related to the sub]."
Wooops I thought I answered this...\n\nWell anyway, negative on that. They are glued together. The pegs are there primarily for alignment. Unfortunately, the components are too thin to be able to hold itself together without some kind of adhesive.\n\nSorry.
Found the Widow main that misses everything. 😂
Just checked the invoices and I did make a mistake, 001XXX and 15XXXX is R1+ extras. \n\nSorry about that. In any case, I should be able to ship them out(yours included) by the end of the week.
It most certainly looks like that in person, this is the second ultra-gloss Bastion that's had its topcoat crack/shrink during transport as [it didn't look like that when it was still with me.](http://i.imgur.com/5P6JkcU.jpg)\n\nIt had already been 2 weeks or so after the topcoat was applied on this particular unit when that picture was taken. So I'm just going to assume that it hates the hot-cold-hot temperature shifts. It comes in a metal can too so that aggravates the issue.
[Yours is the white one in between the orange and teal(2nd row, center of the image).](http://i.imgur.com/0jXaQJp.jpg) \n\n:)
**Bastion Sitrep**\n\n***\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Hi there!** How's it going everyone? \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been getting PMs about the army of Bastions and I just wanted to update everyone on how things are coming along and to address a few questions. Oh and I apologize for not being to respond to everyone previously.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**First, when do you get yours?**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tentative ~~ETA week of December 12-18 or (worst case) 19-25.~~ \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are currently a bit off schedule from the December 9 (completion)/ December 10 (shipping) target date since I've been getting complaints about smell, nausea and whatnot. While I personally wear a respirator mask while painting, the people around me don't. And as much as I'd want to just say fuck it and keep doing it anyway, I happen to also like being friends with said people. Because of this I've decided to slow things down a bit. I also powered through the ivory and white bits in one day and felt absolutely horrendous afterwards*^(might ^be ^asthma ^related)*, so there's that. \n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Second, what about those that were shortlisted (from R2)?**\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few cancellations and there are 20 extras for R1. I will message you if I could include yours, that is if I haven't already. But there are several factors that would affect this like components that need to be re-done and time. *Unless you want yours to not have faceplates or something* xD.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Third, will they ever be on sale again(after R1 and R2)?**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure. TBA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Fourth, do you haz a website?**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working on it, finishing the keycaps takes priority though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n**MISC**\n\n[Total part count for R1](https://i.imgur.com/pQEW3cM.jpg) (For the record, Core: Frame+Faceplate+Lens Cover+ Side Armor; Sub: Chin + Side detail)\n\n[Hmmm...](http://i.imgur.com/0vBBmm6.jpg)\n\n\nThat's all for now.\n\nCheers.\n\n\n\n\n
Seems like the gloss topcoat's cracking. :(\n\nI'll send a replacement along with the second batch.
I can't get over how nice this looks. D:
sick tat, questionable dad-horns xD
lol. exactly what i meant, thanks!\n
explain yourself!! i'm currently playing a death-domain cleric. love it\n
I've never heard of Resting Troll Face.\n
decriminalize, legalize, and use the war-on-drugs money to create a campaign of addiction/substance abuse help throughout the country. 
i use an ergodox for all my gaming; league, wow, skyrim/fallout, overwatch, etc. I love the setup. The only change I made which made a monster of a difference was programming that little key on the bottom right before the thumb cluster to be space too. the most comfortable layout. another nice thing about ergodox is that it's essentially a half-keyboard and can flat around like a gamepad. \n
Not a pizza guy, but shit, I know exactly what you're talking about. It's like they're made to point directly into my eyes when I drive by.
If any of those kids who discuss previous life happenings are correct, it's weird. I'm open to it and that seems like good proof, but I remain skeptical.
Same boat dude. I get severe anxiety if I think about actually trying to fall asleep, so I have to let myself just fall asleep by surprise. lol
As a usual lurker, (honest question) what kind of posts could cause such a fiasco as what we're seeing? How could there be drama on such a board? The content is pretty straight forward and there really isn't room for strong opinion, right?
sick, thanks!\n
hahah welllll, you aren't wrong...
Ever since the first time I saw this image, that fucking dumb face has been burned into my mine. It haunts me. It's the face I see during sleep paralysis. \n
Pm'd. Thanks!
well shit, this is literally exactly what i need. thanks!\n
Sick board OP. Peep [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhy_e5wIX44) while you type. 
sorry to hear that pal. i will say not having kids is nice, though i don't know what kind of wholesome feeling i'm missing out on that i just haven't felt. as for the wife deal, that's kind of one of my worries with my current wife. i love her to the end of the universe, but she and i can be stubborn. so that worries me how it would transform when a small child's life is involved. best of luck to you dude, i hope you find your happiness.
Bad Ben. Some extra things in the shadows I didn't see before.
damn dude, make a starterpack about it why dontcha\n
I do this (not the pennies nickels thing tho). I defend doing it personally because I worked a uscan for several years and am fast af. I can't stand how wasteful and bullshit the bagging policies are at grocery stores. 
I guess it's better to wear the boot than to be under it.
States that you can find a RBG, kill it, then invite them to your party? I thought the portal was only accessible to those in the game at the time of the kill.
Exactly what adinan89 said. Once the community moved up as a group, it got harder and harder to get into mythics. Your best bet is to create a group of your own like stated before and just be prepared to wait for a sec, especially if you're dps. There are people out there in your situation, even people with high ilvl mains looking to get their alts in somewhere. Good luck bud!
oh sick! does this work just as well in seasonal campaigns?\n
looks sick, though, you'll never reach end game. there is no end game\n
Wasn't terrible. Hurt a little, but I have a poor tolerance for pain, so it probably wasn't bad at all. haha. I was eating seasoned fries that same night!
Healing is a ton of fun. I would maybe look at holy priest or holy pally to start. Monk healing is difficult; when you fall behind, it's really hard to get back up. I would say get comfortable with healing first before getting into more nuanced play styles.  \n  \ninb4: someone says i'm completely wrong. this has been my experience.
Would this be what you were talking about?  \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69ix9VdBskE
you are the best. thanks a ton\n
Phoenix Tapes 97 - if you're into found footage type shit. love it myself\n
he blew a ton of spells... isn't that what's supposed to happen?\n
Is your name Thomas?\n
oh yea buddy. if you have the gold, then just spend the fuck out of it. otherwise, you gotta farm marks and other shit. haha. good thing is that if you get 25 heirlooms you get a free mount that works at level 1.\n
[This](http://www.enworld.org/forum/attachment.php?s=6602e0dd99a112b91dbd6cc23d72ab7c&attachmentid=64858&d=1414775237) is what I've been using. I'm new to cleric so the hardest part has been figuring out what happens because i'm a cleric, and what happens because i'm death domain. Best of luck!
Is there a way I could get 4 of those top plates from you? :) Those are looking real nice.
she even bot a head start!\n
inb4: muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda muda \n
thanks!!
dammit already fucking chuckling. thanks
perfect, thanks!\n
I found it rather difficult to find a good HDMI cable that would support the speed as well as not take my wallet into the 4th dimension. I would suggest sticking with DVI or DisplayPort. I am currently using both of these with my setup right now. There is no *real* difference in those cords, other than function. HDMI carries audio as well. I put the DisplayPort on my main monitor and the DVI on my 2nd. But that's just personal choice. Best of luck and be sure to shop around for a good priced cord! They are wayyyy overly priced.
thanks, i'll have a look through this. do i have to worry about sizing translating when approaching a business to cut the materials? I saw something awhile back about a dude that had a top plate cut way too small because it didn't translate the size properly or something.\n
If you get around to it, post a screenshot of the back of your PC, particularly your video card. I can try to suss out what's what and go from there. If you have a video card you will *not* want to be using the mobo video plug at all.
At least it's right twice a day.
Damn, and we still can't get Roosters to do online ordering for pickup. What is this world?!
yea, i guess it wasn't very clear. i want a line in front of my arrow so i can see the line i'm traveling on the map. QOL change, nothing major\n
I'd modify baseball .. would make it hockey. Should work.
were you jesus?\n
someone check the fucking pixels.
i've got XGIVEUPX on my inner, lower lip, 3 x's on my left calf, and my remembering never skull tattoo was intended to be that as well, but not really.  \n  \nEdit: oh shit, yea totally have drug free on the front of my shins, but they are old outlines.\n
more edge memes pls. so tired of answering "why you are edge" threads\n
Congrats to everyone that can afford these.
gah! i fucking knew it and i still laughed!\n
are you seriously not getting what is going on? the line is to extend the arrow. look at what the line does to the arrow vs. what the arrow does on its own.
I remember having purple gack. Was playing with it on the toilet one day and dropped it in with my poopy water by accident. I was so sad, and there was not saving it from there.
these look pretty awesome. you may enjoy the works of Thomas Doyle. The body of work is called Distillations. http://www.thomasdoyle.net/distillation/
dat necklace though\n
I would say their first 2 albums are definitely in a Deathcore vein. Their current status, no way, but they used to shred for sure.
I've got a Planck and Preonic. I do not have set keycaps, they are basically frankenstein'd Miami keys on my Planck, and some spare Cherry profile blanks on my [Preonic](http://i.imgur.com/yqLrb1N.jpg). All the keys on this Preonic are from one set. These work fine for me though because I'm not super interested in non-blank keycaps.  \n  \nI prefer the Preonic just because that's less layer keying I have to deal with and you get a couple other keys freed up due to the extra row making room. 
ayyyy, thanks!
I apologize for lack of further information, but there was a post a little while back about a dude making videos in his house about his birds, and after the videos were out people started noticing a figure in the background of one. Then it finishes off with him walking around his house in that sort of deafening silence we all hear when scared and listening. Was a nice little bit of content, maybe another person has the info.
downvoted
Any board with blacks or browns. Blacks because they are a little heavier than reds, so your resting hand doesn't so easily press it. Blacks or browns because they are non-clacky, blacks being linear and browns being tactile. 
i mean... i get that, but i want to see where i'm gonna end up when i'm flying clear across the zone and i want to alt+tab or not stare/check the map constantly to make sure i'm not off course. I will take your comment under advisement.
lol i see what you did there
teach meeeeee\n
you got so mad that you went and made a start pack about this. be aware that you did that\n
I would also recommend checking out some youtube videos. I put a mirror shine on my keyboard back plate with some super high grit sandpaper, spraypaint, and clear coat. GL!
I had many friends take this route. They aren't belligerent fuccboi's like impassioned, new-born edge preachers would have you believe.  
Dude at SwitchTop is top tier. I've ordered a lot from them and he's always been very diligent in shipping. Prices are great too.
Is there a mailing list or some way to get notifications when this goes on sale? I need need need this!
imo should've re-branded after mitch bit it. 
What were those sticky little stand offs you used? \n\nThanks!
You are holding him to this perfect idea of who you think he is, whether you know you are or not. That's why I think it's bothering you. I know the feelings you're having, I'm sure a lot of us have seen friends break. We worry about them, sometimes thinking they are making a bad decision. You sound like you already know that he's got to live his own life. It's up to you how you process your feelings on the matter and if you continue to let it bother you.  \n  \nI've kept some friends that broke, others I've stepped away from. People change. Best of luck, dude!
Nice! Thanks for the response! From what I read, you are shipping from Hong Kong?
Squeeze your hands really tight to force new calluses to form under the stain.
Hey dude. After having a look, those appear to be DisplayPort plugs. Does the monitor you have offer display port in the back? [This](https://sgcdn.startech.com/005329/media/products/gallery_large/DP2VGAMM6.C.jpg) is what I would shoot for. 
I liked it, but one criticism: the cussing and tone was edge-lord worthy. 
anyone actually believing this hasn't fucking heard babymetal
Not sure, I can't even find it on Joann's website... 
Dude, did this when I was 16 in my ex-gf's bed. Never again. Since that night I make sure to be as empty as possible to the point that I it makes me anxious. 
i was singing the song before i clicked the link. you're the best\n
listening to some music while reading this and the build up of the last paragraph turned to soft silent violins as i read the last two sentences. definitely picking up the controller tonight\n
Are you going to be posting the build log here? Or in a separate post? 
send me a letter about it\n
Tauren. Down to the tribal looking accents, feathers, bones/teeth,  and that axe looks kinda like [Shadow Crescent Axe](http://static.icy-veins.com/images/thumbnails/c9492ea6d8201aa84fbf9bf339049989013c479f4d031ec9d67e515afc54d2b6.jpg).

I honestly never ended up finding an HDMI cable that could handle the load. Your best bet would be to see what you could find in regards to adapters or DVI to DisPort. I am currently using a DVI - DisPort on my side monitor and that runs at 120fps no prob. Just make sure you get the appropriate female/male ends. :)
I think I saw Afropunk reporting that they have since left the Ethics Office alone "...for now."
Same boots man. Shit's weak. Last of my group. RIP
through leveling, not sure how they fare, but their end-game melee dps is strong and their caster/ranged is good/fun for 5-man mythic content (end game). overall they are a super fun class.\n
going through just the leveling with no end game in mind, monk is very obtainable. you can also set up a spec that will let you dps while you're healing. shaman is really fun to heal for 5 mans\n
I'm sure the Lord of the land saw the irony when the revolution was fought with his pitchforks. also, it was a fucking joke, kys
Dude, Seraphim is the best cover band right now. Their covers are so thoughtful and with enough person flavor.
If you're home when it happens a gun is a great deterrent. What if you're at work though? That gun is just a hunk of harmless metal.
Id recommend the GT Omega Racing wheel stand. I have one and its a great setup. Small enough to move out of the way when not in use. Happy racing to your boyfriend. \n\nP.s. Try not to lead him down the sim racing rabbit hole. It's expensive. Just ask my fiancee about the $150 wheel rim i got for xmas to swap onto my thrustmaster tx. Haha
He didn't win MVP because I did with Carson Wentz, but in my second year of an Eagles franchise he had 28 sacks.
PS4 games. Apps. PS2 on PS4. Three folders. Simple and clean. 
Nice. My fiancee is all about RPG's and action games as well. Nice to have someone that supports my hobbies. If your boyfriend isn't aware of it, let him know about Inside Sim Racing. They have a website and youtube channel where they talk about all things sim racing.
Im waiting on my magicforce 68 from a drop that ended what seems like forever ago. Was constantly wondering what the Ducky purple caps looked like. Thank you very much for your post. 
All ea sports games switched from the old engine to ignite in 2013. Fifa made the jump to frostbite for 17. The rest of their lineup will be on frostbite for 18. So...not quite. 
Being obsessive over color scheme I decided one day browsing mechanicalkeyboards.com that I needed to replace my BlackWidow with this, and then swap out the key caps. My PC is in a white fractal r4 and everything in it is color coded white, red and black. Also picked up a white corsair m65 rgb to go with the color scheme. Luckily my fiancee does not know the true cost of this color matching obsession.
I have a fairly small desk and adding the corsair desk mat and glorious gaming wrist rest in the last few weeks means i no longer eat at my desk. Just pull up a tray table now.
Yea that would actually be a perfect medium I think. Would need to fully implement and correct the ability to have play hurt. I.E. lineman play with a sprained MCL more often than WR's and other skill guys do. At least in my observation.
Yep it works. I've noticed that navigating the overlay can *sometimes* be janky, like not being able to switch from the bubbles on the bottom to navigating the rest of the interface, which may be because I had my motion controls powered on at the same time or something else, but it generally works great with the Vive.
So far I have had no issues. I have had it for I would say 5-6 months and it is a very solidly built keyboard. No issues and is definitely holding up better than my Razer did. I have no modding skills and do things purely for aesthetics so I had no clue what I was getting when I ordered it. With a bit of research I came to the conclusion that Ducky made solid keyboards and decided to take the plunge. Glad I did. 
I have a ducky one that i use as my main board. Also use the glorious gaming wrist rest. Its a quality item. Good combo for the ducky especially if youre using the standard or other ducky caps.
Would love for this to exist as well. I like knowing how much time ive spent in game.
Peyton wasn't injury prone. Outside of 2011 or whatever year it was, he never missed time. 
You can do without. I did for a while but because of the height of the case and Ducky caps i started to have wrist pain. Just the extra bit of elevation has made all the difference for me personally. 
Massdrop. The drop had a long wait time but at the lowest tier it was $48 shipped with gaterons and the regular keycaps. My daily driver at home is a white Ducky One with Cherry MX Browns. Contemplating using the magicforce at work once it finally shows up but im not sure. I for sure need a number pad at work but I can always pick up a cheap membrane one of those.
My car has a loud, annoying, never ending beep if i cross 5 mph with either front seat unbuckled. Back seats aren't really an issue because i drive a fiat 500 and unless it is my fiancee's 5'0" twin sister, no one is riding back there.
IMO there's nothing inherently wrong with Razer boards. I was using a 2013 BlackWidow with MX Blues before I switched to a Ducky One with MX Browns. As the previous comment mentioned, once I wanted to swap to different color keycaps though, I had to change it up.
Should work just fine. I use a windows based Logitech wireless for my mac mini HTPC. Win key functions as CMD key. Biggest loss, in my experience, is knowing what the top row does on the Mac as you need to hold FN to get F1 - F12 by default.
Hes not even an owner. Hes the vp of football ops. Lol
Both 6 Apex and Horizon 3. Although they're poorly optimized and are brutal to run on even decent hardware. 
My set of Shine 3 red caps came with a wire puller as well. Im pretty sure they all do. 
I alerted my landlord that some of my stuff had mildew/mold on it in the basement, half expecting a dehumidifier to be in the works. His response was, yea don't put fabric or paper down there. It does that. 
I got mine with gateron browns and white led's, and the regular keycaps, not the typewriter ones, for $48 shipped. Placed the order in december and it isn't supposed to ship until may though.
Just used this after simming the first season of a new Niners franchise. Draft wasn't real deep at the skill positions but i did get 4 day 1 starters including my c, rg, and rt. My C was a 6th rd pick with superstar dev. Best guy was my #1 pick 3-4 rolb who got moved to re since i run a 4-3.\n\nHands down the best thing for cfm i have seen in a long while. Great work. 
In getting the home inspection on our likely new home. Found this buckling spring gem in one of the bedrooms. Wonder if they'd let me keep it. 
For quick play id assume just delete the roster file and say no to the download prompt. For franchise just turn off pre existing injuries. 
Yep. I want to try lower profile caps like DSA's or something on mine but man they're a lot of money. 
While I agree with some of this my one point of comment is the random follies. I'd like it to be as realistic as possible, but there is no way I'd want to be driving for a game winning td or fg and the algorithm sends my shotgun snap over my head. In video game land, I want things to be in my control, not random. It's realistic, but its not fun. 
This was a replacement to my 2013 Razer Blackwidow. The blue's started to get on my nerves and this matches the color scheme of my build. Best $150 I have spent on a keyboard.
This used to be the case. A recent beta update (may be on stable by now) *should* automatically disable SteamVR's reprojection when a Rift is detected. This issue with the Rift using SteamVR reprojection nullifying ASW/ATW was brought up on the SteamVR discussion pages and a fix was released to beta a few days later.
I agree, and no it's definitely not healthy.\n\nBut I will largely disagree on one point: I don't see *nearly* as much fanboyism on the Vive sub. A lot of what I see over there is more /r/pcmr like not-so-serious sarcasm/fanboy imitations for fun. Especially online in Vive MP games.\n\nBut, the Vive sub does have its bad apples (fanboys that talk shit.. pointless drama)... I have to admit... So I can't disagree *that much*
My store turned away all walk ups even while nothing was going on for an hour and 20 minutes... And I had to basically stand there and wait... for an hour and 20 minutes while nothing happened. I should have showed up much later... 
I showed up for my demo... 1 hour and 20 minutes early... Nobody there and pretty much just browsed the store as much as I could for nothing I was going to buy and stood there for 25 minutes akwardly while the demo rep shot the shit with other BB employees... While nothing was going on. A few people walked up to try it and we're disappointed to hear they had to reserve a slot even though nobody had been demoed in an hour and 20 minutes at least.\n\nDuring the demo, the rep was messing with my wife, trying to get her to mess with me while in VR saying how it would be funny. Really pissed me off, left me with a pretty sour taste about the otherwise okay demo (pre-touch). The next day I went and demoed a Vive and they took walk ups, 2nd in line, reps were all enthusiastic and professional. I was sold... Mostly because of the experience (99%).
>  deal with the fallout of people flashing their Steam controllers\n\nThat's their problem at that point... :-P ... plus worst case it's only [$12.99](http://store.steampowered.com/app/530260/) down the drain.
Virtual Desktop has an Environment Maker dialog thingy... Essentially the same format that's compatible with SteamVR environments will work with the VD Environment Editor. You can add in stereo cubemaps to models, or 360 panoramas, however you want to do it. I recreated my apartment and placed a *Giant* virtual screen where our TV is and it's pretty cool for watching movies :-)
That is beautiful.
Yeah it's good. A lot of times I just hang out by myself in my own little world creating a house and other cool gadgets... But it's also a lot of fun exploring other people's world's, meeting other people, having conversations and seeing the crazy things other people come up with beyond your own little (or big) world.

Lol that sounds bad.. and unless u brick it probably couldn't be worse... *But* it can be better! Enable Bluetooth communication... Mine has always been \n\n1: "firmware update available" \n\n2: *click item*\n\n3: "do not power off device while updating... Continue?"\n\n4: *click yes*\n\n5: "updating..."\n\n6: "update successful"\n\nJust about. Never have to plug in anything.
Yes, Van-Gogh.
As false as assumptions made can be, I think the number of subscribers to the sub indicates we have a pretty good representation of all kinds of users... And in turn I feel like we can get a fairly accurate judgement of the user base as a whole.
BAM... it even has a rats level! lol... and an AKM that just takes me back.
I've been hearing that coiling is purely cosmetic, and that they don't really rebound at all. I coiled up just a regular USB cable I had laying around and it came out great. I tried the 'twist it backwards on istelf' trick to tighten it up... It worked but it just came out more loose unfortunately, so I just re-tightened and heated it back up. It came out *great* and retains pretty good tension.\n\nDoes Paracord and techflex make the situation worse? I know you want to wrap and heat with all that on from the get-go, but tech-flex is real rigid imo. I feel like coiling like you do with tech-flex would make for a super rigid, if not springy, cord. \n\nLet me know, I might want to try a coiled cable with techflex... Or whatever leaves me with good tension and springiness.
Sweet!!!!! So glad for you guys with Rifts!!! \n\nHoping this works well for everyone
Oh my... my K65 3d model will now come in handy outside Virtual Desktop :-)\n\n\n**EDIT**:  [Got it working!! I love this program...](http://i.imgur.com/W0zXWXn.jpg) ... just needed to \n\n    setdeviceproperty 0 1029 int32   4  \n\nto set it as a tracking *reference* so it wouldn't trigger the chaperone bounds constantly..  :P
Does this mean I can possibly add my 780 in to help my 1080 run even faster at some point?\n\nEdit: got my answer towards the bottom of the article. Potentially...\n\n> it could hinder the experience with delays, jitter, tearing or out of sync frames. It still could add value to having older, dissimilar GPUs alongside for splitting the workload. Though that’s not likely anytime soon.\n
VRChat has been around since the early DK1 days it seems. It's developed into quite an amazing experience since then... And custom avatars are great... :D\n\nPeople should give this game a try. There always seem to be admins and other devs hanging out too which is great. The presentation room is fun for tiltbrush drawing :-)
... good to know ... \n\nRemindMe! "When /u/dan_t_mann goes flying and decides to check his luggage..."
That's me! :-) I went ahead and PM'd you.

It's totally legit... Just some persons personal project.
Nice! One thing I'm looking to do is be able to bind Vive controller buttons to traditional keyboard inputs / hotkey combos. I have Ctrl + Right Arrow bound to an SSH command that changes songs on my music server, and constantly looking out from under the HMD to find my keyboard can be a bit of a pain to change songs in VR... Can this program do anything like that yet?\n\n**Edit**: wait.. you said remap buttons!?! Gah Thank you Matz!!! I notice you can remap to other openVR buttonIDs, is it possible at this point to reference keyboard input somehow instead?
Decreese Whiz.
Well generic tracking devices are enumerated specifically alongside controllers, HMDs and reference objects as part of OpenVR... And there are already some [cool things](https://youtu.be/0KEeympkT2Y) you can do with virtual tracking devices or even just static reference items in steamVR using /u/matzman666's [OpenVR input emulator software](https://github.com/matzman666/OpenVR-InputEmulator). This basically makes anything possible in the present to short term with minimal effort by *any* of us... Define your variables.. input and whatnot... The possibilities are cream-worthy once we get these pucks. In the meantime you can just use extra controllers with a reflashed steamcontroller dongle for wireless connections... Tape it to a beer can and set the rendermodel to a beer can... It will show you where your beer is whenever you pull up the SteamVR overlay.
support.
I wonder, I've created a few avatars up until last night and now I am stuck on pushing those upload speeds no matter how many new projects I create or how many times I reload the SDK... maybe related?\n\nI loaded up an older avatar project that uploaded just fine up until last night, and today it does not upload...

Can you just unplug your internet, disable Oculus services from accessing the internet, then replugin internet?
I hope Oculus opens up their tracking to 3rd parties, but i'd guess it will be kept under heavy NDA *IF ANYTHING*, and remain an Oculus 1st party product.\n\nPlease tell me I am wrong, but I fear they haven't 100% ironed down everything about their tracking system and where they want it to go... and that they probably want to figure that out for themselves first before opening the flood-gates. I know they are doing a ton of research and experimentation to figure out where they want to go as a company, but I also fear this probably means they aren't going to be open to handing it out freely to anyone who wants to add all sorts of random tracking devices to the experience. Oculus seems to me to be focused on a seamless user experience, and if anything was opened up tracking wise from Oculus... I suspect it would probably come out as a first party peripheral, limited to the Oculus ecosystem to maintain that seamless experience. \n\nIn my opinion, Oculus is taking the "safe-route"... keeping experiments *in-house* and releasing only what *they* know is good. I think they probably see opening tracking to 3rd parties as a **HUGE** liability. I feel like Oculus has control over their ship, and they want it to stay that way.
How do you like the clears on your core btw? I ordered mine with clears.
Thanks, my wife helped pick the colors. I bought dampeners too- probably won't need them either... we will see. :P I'm also downsizing from a TKL (k65)\n\nI got the cable from [1UpKeyboards.com](https://1upkeyboards.com/diy-no-solder-usb-cable-kit.html). I *really* love pete's selection and it beats ordering paracord, techflex, heat shrink, usb wire and adapters in bulk all separately. I think a custom USB cable would go great on your desk with that keyboard.
:-P thanks for not making me look like a douche like every other time I try to have fun with spelling mistakes then people edit them and I get downvoted to purgatory :-)
* Make or download your model. \n\n* Use mixamo to rig it up, or otherwise rig it up\n\n* Import it to unity\n\n* Set prefab to humanoid and click configure bones... If all is green hit done.\n\n* Import the SDK to unity\n\n* Assign an avatar descriptor script and set the height of the white ball to right in front of your avatars eyes\n\n* Add the avatar controller to the avatar\n\n* Sign in to the build control panel in unity under the VRchat tab and export your model after setting cam position\n\n* Enjoy in game!
Same thing happening to me recently as well. It must have came to us with a recent SteamVR update.
I decided to stop by Joanne's fabric store to find materials for a sleeve. I don't have *any* skills sewing or doing fabric stuff, and I don't have a sewing machine. \n\nThe lady at the store recommended I use fabric bond that you iron together... I think it came out okay.\n\nI've got materials coming in to make a matching USB cord and keycaps colored like the last image in the album... very excited. My wife said she wouldn't mind as long as the stuff I get is *'pretty'*.\n\nBonus image: [tried coiling a non-custom micro USB last night for the first time](http://i.imgur.com/UF30VT8.jpg).
I think the argument that they are locking you to Steam is wrong. You can run SteamVR outside Steam. Right now you have SteamVR only because there haven't been any other alternatives to hook into OpenVR... But that doesn't mean they can't or won't exist in the future. I think that's probably one thing that Khronos is working on. In the meantime, feel free to launch your OpenVR content *outside* Steam itself.
*THAT* is beautiful! Thanks for the video!
I might try that... but take a look into AMZL. Amazon uses contract delivery drivers who drive unmarked vans. It's Amazon's effort to cut costs by being their own carrier.
Somewhat off the OP topic, but in response to your post...\n\nAs effective as Linux can accomplish the things I do personally, it's not 100% effective for me as utilizing closed software- specifically Microsoft Office. My work uses it, classes I take use it... its ubiquitous. \n\nSure, Openoffice / Libreoffice *work* alright, there are inter-compatibility issues, general usability pitfalls, and other OS things like heavy battery consumption, sleep / wake problems, wifi-driver incompatibilities... all sorts of things that I can figure out just fine *on my own time*... but when pressed with deadlines, specific formats and fonts, and generally needing my tech to work in new environments with proprietary formats like .pdf as fast as possible... I find using Linux to be a major hindrance. \n\nI love linux, I have it exclusively on ALL my PCs / laptops except for one laptop for school and work. Linux enriches my life in so many ways: sharing music to myself anywhere on my own terms, remote administration, creativity, programming, desigining UIs.. If my laptop had the hardware capability to virtualize efficiently and not chew through battery like it does already running Linux, than I would just run Office in a VM. Maybe it's just my configuration, but Linux on some of my hardware has a problem with the UI locking up as well... and when I need to print that paper, or research a topic in a limited amount of time, I don't want to have to [CUPS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUPS) on the spot because it's a new printer in a new place or have my laptop's screen go catatonic. \n\nI hope Linux evolves to be more resource friendly over time, and if Microsoft really *loves* linux... release Office for Linux. \n\n**TLDR**: Proprietary software is 90% the reason why I have Windows on ONE of my machines. :-( The other 10% is the stability/battery usage. \n\nAs for the OP... I can't wait to use my Vive on Linux native instead of in my VM. Super happy :-) Hopefully devs start releasing Linux ports soon.
With a 1070: \n\nApp SS - 1.3 or 1.4\n\nCompositor SS - keep lower for better performance overall or 1.3 - 1.4 like above.\n\nAllow async.\n\nDisable interleaved.\n\nInterleaved halves framerate for consistency when you drop below 90fps. Async fills in missed frames with updated head rotation without dropping to 45fps. Compositor SS increase means clearer SteamVR environment and overlay. App SS increase renders games at higher resolution for a clearer image (just like compositor SS but for your VR apps instead.)\n
ZOMGZOMGZOMGZOMG... \n\nGoing to have to unbind vfio-pci and give this a go!!!
Obviously, Half-Life, Half-Life, and Half-Life...
It is a really good mod. I've been using [mine](http://m.imgur.com/a/nNom3) for 7 months now and it's held up perfectly. I couldn't imagine VR without it or something as good or better.
I agree... I love the way Valve is going about VR. \n\nI don't know how hackable Oculus' code is... but in my ^limited experience futzing around with SteamVR... the platform's hardware *and* software invites limitless innovation. Sure, lighthouse tech is great, but OpenVR for example works with any tracking system. Drivers exist for Razer Hydra (magnetic), Rift sensors, HDK sensors, DK2 sensors, lighthouse, and all sorts of other things like TrackIR, Freetrack, Opentrack (and the various tracking techniques those use) via 3rd party compatibility layers. In terms of compatibility, it comes down to "*if you have a VR device, it probably works with SteamVR*". \n\nIn addition to working with *basically* anything, as long as a driver exists for it... the software is hackable: you can make your own launchers, like Viveport for example. SteamVR doesn't require *Steam* to run, so your launcher can be independent if you like. You can design new menus for the existing overlay, or modify the existing ones. With Matzman666's virtual input emulator, you can add OpenVR tracking devices of all sorts- Reference objects ([think virtual keyboard?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KEeympkT2Y)), virtual controllers that track against additional tracking devices (tracking pucks, or your own hardware like the guy who made a tracked coffee mug). Change your environment before going into games all you want, scan your room using photogrammetry tech available in your pocket (smart phone) and boot into your own VR space... make it yours. I've really only covered software and a little hardware stuff, but all the hardware specs are open and we are all free to create all we want... I *LOVE* it.  \n\nStill, this doesn't mean I don't love Oculus... Although it'd be great to see some *openness* initiatives on their part. Like a beta branch ;-)\n\nAs for playing *cross-platform*: We are pretty much there already... Rift can play OpenVR games... Vive can play Oculus games (revive)... HDK works with openVR which works with revive... Cardboard and Gear users can use RiftCat to link up with SteamVR which works with revive...

Works great for me!
There are pretty good filters to get to the good stuff. Popular new releases, Top Sellers, What people are playing, etc. Even though there are hundreds of pages of crap, if you use the filters (which are usually defaulted to as-well) you shouldn't have to look very far at all to find great games. Keep looking real deep and sure you will find a ton of crap... but i've never had to *wade* through crap to find good experiences.
Yeah, I thought it was weird... I don't hold anything against Oculus, or Best Buy... It was just one experience and I guess I got a not as excited / motivated as the rest kinda guy which is whatever. 🤔
:-D 
Amazon loves to deliver packages to other buildings around me for some reason. I just walk across the street, find a similar number... lo and behold- my packages sitting at someone else's doorstep. I *steal* them of course, because they are addressed to me! \n\njeez.
I couldn't understand a word he said... \n\n\nLucid, you say?
Guys no.\n\nWhat we need is *some kind* of *rendering* that improves performance by tracking your gaze, that reduces quality in areas we can't see as *clearly*.\n\nOr bad HDMI connections.
Where can I get one, and is DSA a possibility?

I ran across a guy last night asking why the table on the Onward lobby was so low, and if a game update changed it. People in the room asked if he had an Oculus and he said "yeah, why?" \n\n... I guess he doesn't follow the Oculus reddit 
Or flash the VR controller firmware to the Steam Controller dongle. You can buy the dongle itself for under $10... It should be easy enough to buy a couple lighthouses and controllers if you really want to do this. I'd love to know how it works.
Well you do *license* Windows to use it... With all the limitations and agreements you make to use the license. 
You could also try the program called Corsair effects engine instead of CUE... Your lighting can optionally act as an audio visualizer
It hurts :(
I love how agnostic OpenVR API is. You can have more than two tracking sensors, just like 4 Rift sensors work in SteamVR. If Valve makes the new base station hardware able to sync across 3 or 4 base stations, than the software support is already there in OpenVR... They would just need to amend the current lighthouse driver or pop a new one out. I'm hopeful that it could be done with the new design.
I think I'll try that tonight.\n\n*Edit*:\n\nIt looks like a reinstall of unity solved my issue too! It hung up on uploading preview image... but for some reason when I changed the name of the avatar (world name?) to the Prefab name, it seemed to work. It may be unrelated, but I tried it 3 or 4 times before changing to match the prefab name and it worked. \n\nRegardless, working now! Unity re-install + *possible* name change did it... didn't have to reload SDK or anything, the project loaded back up just fine.

It's not that complicated actually... once you do it a couple times, the whole process is a breeze. 
Battle Dome has a desktop mode in addition to VR. It was *the* original popular FPS game during the Vives early days after release, before Onward hit Steam.\n\nA ton of content has been added since, but the player count has mostly died off since then. You used to be able to find at least two full lobbies at any given time... which back then was *a lot*. Still, some of my first and best memories in VR were in that game. TDM for hours, highly reminiscent of paintball and laser tag with just as much sweat to go along with it. \n\nIf you can find players, it's a super fun competitive game.
Fantastic! Thank you!
I say this all the time to people.. it's a little bit of work, but probably much cheaper than the Deluxe head-strap... You can get someone in your town to 3D print some adapters using a site like 3DHubs and purchase some headgear meant for welding face shields. It can be setup with a bit of extra padding on the headgear and take *all* the HMD weight off your face - super comfortable. With the ear buds, you can route them towards the front and down the sides so they always hang right next to your ears and never go anywhere.
Dodge, dip, duck, dive, *dodge!*\n\nCan't wait for wireless.
The Steam Controller dongle can be reflashed to connect controllers directly to the host (PC) right now. This is how the pucks will work- dongles that ship with the correct firmware already.
Are you guys planning on some kind of decoupled movement for the SteamVR mode?
If you ordered from HTC, just hit up live chat. They will have one on your doorstep in a few days free of charge. My dog chewed mine to shreds and they have a policy of replacing one of any *cable* for free.
traffic, rain, distance... it wasn't just right around the corner, we kind-of made a mini part-day trip out of it.
Yep! The assumption that ASW doesn't work is false. This idea probably stems from the fact that SteamVR didn't used to automatically disable the built-in SteamVR reprojection techniques for Oculus devices, in which case the Oculus runtime would register 90fps as SteamVR was cutting to 45 fps, reprojecting to 90, and sending 90fps to Oculus runtime... hence no ASW. \n\nOnce SteamVR reprojection (async and interleaved) is disabled, Oculus runtime will accurately register dips in framerate and Oculus ASW/ATW will kick in. A somewhat recent SteamVR update automatically disables SteamVR reprojection for Rift users, so everything Oculus "warp" should work fine by default, even for OpenVR/non-Oculus native games, as they are all fed to the Oculus runtime for display to the Rift. Totally false that ASW won't work on pretty much any games the Rift runs.
He looks so cute! I think my wife will love this one. Congrats man!
yes. Good. Very good.

I used it in a custom [Virtual Desktop environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMIwbbYegFM), and now I can take it with me everywhere in the SteamVR Overlay! Thanks matz!\n\nHere's one way to use Matzman666's OpenVR Input Emulator... add some reference objects to your SteamVR dashboard!

No way they hold SteamVR's ASW for GDC... no way. That's an unfaithful move.
Going to have to give this a try tonight now. Thanks for making a demo devs!!
Absolute beauty.
It looks like nobody has mentioned it yet, but HTC support provides one free replacement cable (*any cable*). You just need your order # and serial #... hit up live chat. They had a new cable on my doorstep within 3 days of contacting them, no charge to me.

I've got Cherry MX Clears on it... I like them :-) \n\nI'm coming from Cherry MX Reds on my other board, and I haven't ever really used tactile or clicky switches before, so it took some getting used to / breaking in a bit. Now i'm feeling them. I also added a couple red dampeners under each keycap which makes this board feel super plush and relatively silent, which is exactly what I need for class.
Interesting... The PSVR HMD looks easiest to use with this because it just slips in vertically, but the docks for the controllers don't look to be supported by anything but USB... Surely an adapter would fix this. Vive being second easiest because of the flexible headstrap able to be pulled through. \n\nRift compatibility I applaud, but it looks like a pain to pull the HMD in and out of the wall mount config. It looks like the top strap catches going in, and then the headphones look like they squeeze in and would catch on the way out.
There is also the situation that they *are* developing games for VR, but the target platform is not the platform they are targeting (Oculus)... so it seems to me that it seems to them to be in their best interest to screw over the competing platform to bolster their stake in the VR market they are targeting. This just shows me even more how shitty of a company they are.
I know what im doing tonight.
How long has it been since you installed / messed with / tightened your lighthouses? I was having severe *controller* tracking last night, and noticed my controllers were at 2 out of 4 green dots in SteamVR, and quickly went to 1 dot. \n\nAfter restarting my computer, fully charging the controllers, spending some time re-orienting my lighthouses to face them directly at the center of my playspace just between my HMD / natural controller position, mounting the lighthouses from the bottom instead of the rear to lift them up even more, tightening down the lighthouses **HARD**, and running a **long**  (4 mo?) overdue fresh room-setup... my controllers now track **PERFECT**, \n\nIt is really amazing after almost 10 months of *almost* sorta-perfect tracking, and last nights horrible tracking, to now have FLAWLESS tracking! :D \n\nI wish you luck. 
Your post title seems to imply that you won't get ASW on OpenVR/SteamVR only games...
[This is what I used](http://i.imgur.com/VSfMWKy.jpg). I wouldn't call it super strength... and you're definitely correct- sewing would be *much* stronger.\n\nRegardless, it seems strong enough. I had to wet a 'press-cloth' quite a bit and iron over a few times in a few places, especially around the zipper to get it to hold **solid**-*solid*. I did my best to ensure the seams weren't going to just pull straight apart from each other, so one side is bonded to the other from the inside on multiple layers of both fabric and bond. Up top near the zipper, the seams were coming apart a bit, so I [added some support](http://i.imgur.com/kvnpZag.jpg) to ensure they won't come apart over time.\n\nThe total material cost was about $10... which left me with enough fabric / bond to re-try at least a few times if I were to royally fuck up or not like how it turned out.
Comcast just rolled out caps for everyone I think. Sucks balls.
Dear ASW, thank you for all the hope you give us. PLEASE bless thy framerate and interpolate our ever moving trajectories. Let us live in your tranquility for all of Gen 1, in Lord GabeN's name I say... 
* view distance adjustment options ... I can't see most of the objects in my home environment, especially distant ones.\n\n* ability to 'paint' objects... like a couple different brushes with adjustable transparency and adjustable size that we can use to brush various colors / emissives / etc onto existing objects\n\n

The only real gripe I had with Steam early on during the beta transition from WON was the fact that we would no longer have WON. There were a few issues with game updates and Steam instability, but nothing really sticks out past losing WON... We didn't lose any functionality, and auto-updating games became a godsend. I don't miss having to manually download all my CS/TF updates from a website. I do miss those days though, those salty days of the steam icon fucking some guy in the ass..
I just kinda planned it out in my head beforehand, measured the cuts a couple inches bigger initially and went ham. 
I didn't get a lens wipe. 
Good thing someone has an explanation for this. Otherwise, watch out... Conspiracies abound...
You could always just edit your steamvr.vrsettings file without the need for SteamVR addons. That is all the *add-on* does anyways is edit the steamvr.vrsettings file for you. :-)
yeh. should still be good viewing. We've already reserved a campsite on the other end of the country dead center in the path for our own fun and photography.
We'll have to see what remenant of the paragon system is in Andromeda - they've mentioned doing away with a really obvious pos/neg choice wheel.
Oh dear, I'd love to squish that purple on to my wife's board as a present. Here's hoping!
Or get a non HFCS ketchup like Simply Heinz or your personal favorite brand that does non HFCS (I think French's does a non-HFCS ketchup too, and cheap) and add in a healthy dousing of Tapatio, Cholula, or whatever red pepper sauce you like most!\n\n(Personally I like to use Tapatio for everything, but especially spicy ketchup and spicy mayo. When the 1 liter glass bottle of Tapatio is like, 3 bucks? Worth.)

Wow, I'd love to see this come true in any... every profile. Well, almost every. Looks stunning!
PMed!
If that is the case (And we'll know soon since they already have post 6b SA GBs on the books), we'll write them off as a manufacturer for this set and take this to one of the other manufacturers which has started to tool  up SA profile.\n\nWorst case scenario, we change the profile. But we'll sit on it before we change it, NASA looks the best on SA, we will do whatever we can to keep it on SA.
Soo pretty. Hard to pick, but entered! GL all.
Confirmed
We might just have to borrow this form factor for a SA NASA related PCB & Case ... if you don't terribly mind us doing so!
We'll have to see though - they haven't really shown us much about the way we play the story side of the game yet! If para/ren return, I could see to making the appropriate novelty caps to go in a ME:A set.
PMing
Damn this is saddening. I guess I'll throw those GB funds at the Let's Split GB instead once the refunds come through.\n\nSorry to hear they put you through this mate, you made an a+ effort for us!
Too kind.
We are considering MD or running it ourselves. We're also looking at alternative SA manufacturers, since SP does prefer MD, and has a lead time that may already be in to 2018 now.
I got mine too, and i def. love the aesthetic and those pins. It's a great looking switch.\n\nThe few I've played with have started to smooth out, enough to warrant the price alone? I don't think so. But combined with the aesthetic, wobble reduction, and those pins? maybe gettin' there.
For sure. I tried to organize things neatly and knock things about in a way that makes it easier to get through but, no doubt, it's a beast.
> Do Devlin just leave the sprues like that though?\n\nI dunno. When I get the SkiData set they're doing (if i don't cancel out), I'll be able to make a better judgement.

Seconding this! And for the help with SA NASA (among so many other people)
It's a crap shoot. If you know Aristotles you know how iffy they can be sometimes. But if it works and you can wear away that stickiness i experienced at first with it, I think there's something about the quality of the click in this combo that really does make it qualify as 'authoritative'. Or at least, demanding of attention.
I don't think the USPS has it in their mind to take the heat on a felony for an employee. They're like any other employer - they'll ship you down that river far sooner than they'd ship themselves. Not to mention, what's to gain for them besides more trouble? A lot of packages are insured by default, and many people take the added insurance - they do themselves no favors keeping a known thief in their midst.\n\nAnd it's perfectly plausible. I've worked in distribution and sorting centers and the like (never USPS, but they buy they hire the same designers and builders) and seen these machines do this kinda shit. Rollers can eat the paper right off a box... while the box merrily rolls along. If it did this after the sort scan, it easily coulda been bumped to its bin, where it woulda been mindlessly loaded, without its orphaned label, in to a truck.\n\nA day later, some unwitting sap in a rig has dropped your box in an entirely different state from its label, which has been recovered, sad and dejected, from the floor beneath the rollers.\n\nIs it possible this was theft? Sure, it absolutely is. But don't dismiss the heart of Hanlon's razor just yet, and don't think it's that easy to go picking around the DLO's looking for one particular box without a label.\n\n(As an example, I once fielded a bomb threat to one of the distro centers I worked at - the description I was given was a "small white box with no labels" yeah, you think that helped us locate any less than a thousand suspect packages in a 10,000sqft warehouse?)
Yep! On the fence on getting it atm. I like it, I just don't have anywhere to display it.
I haven't tried that combination yet, even though everything to do it is right in front of me!\n\nYour description makes me think that you might share my opinion about the pandastotles - they are loud, and harsh. It's a super pronounced click. To me, it feels more pronounced than a standard aristotle, or a gatistotle, or the pandosen. I think that slight size difference between a normal aristotle stem and the rest kind of amps it up.\n\nAnd yeah, fosen is awesome, but basically just because of the stem and top housing colors. If it were possible to put the fosen top housing on the bottom panda housing, that'd be my final take on the pandosen recipe.
Sweet! Keep us updated!
Takes cooking heat outdoors, instead of indoors. A semi-legitimate excuse to grill.

Will look in to it!
You probably won't shoot a gun in this style, though if you do, it is likely to be this exact one.\n\nThis is a PGO Mossberg 500 - they come this way (and a million other configurations) stock, and are terribly fun to shoot if handled right (this can be said of *most* guns though). My training put's this gun lower and tighter to the body, and held with a much firmer grip. If you do get the chance to open up witha PGO Shottie, remember to hang on to the lil fucker tight, and don't be afraid to ask for a few low recoil shells to start with, get a feel for the characteristic before you punish yourself with double ought or slugs.\n\nThis was my wife's first shotfun. It's just what we had on hand was this exact model/configuration, and she did not turn it in to a projectile all its own. This was setup, or someone who was not properly advised (or not properly paying attention to the instruction) on how this gun works and how to hang on to it.
Just to further underscore the stupidity of this bill - children born through artificial insemination methods in Saudi Arabia are still considered legitimate.\n\nSo uhm, congratulations Senator, you one upped Sharia Law.
We're looking in to it too - we'd love to take this set to a competitor if they can produce a satisfactory quality for a competitive price!
I don't think there is any excuse for his wait times in the end. If you run a store, and you post ETAs for products purchased, you should strive not to just meet them, but beat them. GBs I'm a bit more lenient with thanks to the process, but he has the capacity to modify his ETAs if he gets in to a backlog. Instead he doesn't, and he communicates poorly with those who have already paid him. That's a redflag for me.\n\nIf you're really set on him - the only thing that's truly outstanding or special are his PCBs, I'd go somewhere like 1upkeyboards.com, or a /u/leandren group buy to acquire them. (That and leandren's case designs are magnificent things)\n\nThe communication thing is just a monster red flag imho, and I've since decided that the PCB just isn't special enough to deal with that again. The only way I'll personally end up with anymore of his stuff is through other stores/GBs.
paid. ty ty!
Top row is the frankenswitches, bottom row is the donor switches:\n\nTop row, left to right:\n\n* Fosda (Panda Stem x Fosen Housing) Not a great switch by any means. Just another linear with no outstanding qualities that make it remarkably good or bad.\n* Gatistotle (Aristotle Stem x Gateron Housing) Obviously, a great switch. It's a well known mod that pulls its weight. definitely a favorite.\n* Pandastotle (Aristotle Stem x Panda Housing) I can only describe this switch as angry. The actuation is somewhere around 75g of force, and that's after you 'break it in', meaning wear down the edges of the Aristotle enough that it stops hanging on the Panda housing. The fit is tenuous at best for this reason. The click is loud, authoritative, and clearly announces the switches displeasure with you. It may even be begging for death, I'm not sure.\n* Pandosen (Fosen Stem x Panda Housing) Around 70-72.5g actuation, but not nearly as upset as the Pandastotle. The fit is good, the look is good, and the click is not quite as loud, and nowhere near as angry. I may actually build a complete board with this combination. The more I paly with this one, the more I enjoy it.
Two 6.25u spacebars in all modifier kits is our plan - whatever modifier kit you pick, it will automatically have that color 6.25u, and an orange 6.25u :)\n\nAs for a Mass Effect set - if the interest is there, I'll talk to BioWare about the license. Andromeda's color scheme is very open, so people who aren't loons (like me) for the franchise might still find utility in the kit's color schemes.

I think I'm in a good place to do the ME:A theme. I can freely admit that [i'm a little obsessed](http://imgur.com/a/6t0Y6) with the ME series :) (And that gallery of merch I own is at leat a year out of date atm, I got a lot to add to it!)
Thanks! We hope to do more sets (that's why the end of the poll asks for interest in some of our ideas!) and to take the same approach of really getting in and making ourselves knowledgeable about the subject of the theme, and then bringing the community in to help further guide and finalize what we envision. Though, we plan to make those sets simpler - NASA has been a bear to work because of the large color variation. We want to trim that down in the future, this was a lot of work.\n\nI thankfully have saved myself EPS for all the novelty keys (I redrew everything so that we have our personal EPS for these, not someone else's). So if the manufacturer we choose comes back with issues, we can make adjustments to every one of them to ensure the detail level hits that balance where they can reliably produce a viable key that looks good.
She ain't got UFC level training and she just got her back and the back of her head bounced off a pretty unforgiving surface. For her, this pretty much was a liver shot. She's probably stunned and winded. There's no conscious thought in to what she does in the next like, half a second of video we get in this gif, it's just automatic reactions to a very stunning take down.
I can wholeheartedly recommend varmilo keycaps, they are spectacular quality in thick PBT.
Well, I paid 150 for my full custom varmilo set 🙈 SP's prices are horrendous.
[I love the color scheme ;)](https://www.reddit.com/comments/5e5lhw)\n\nSeriously though, amazing work on the case, looks really nice!
I considered the idea, but ran in to a few roadblocks.\n\n1. MiTo did this with Godspeed, I didn't want to be MiTo jr.\n2. I think the text represents NASA as clearly as it would whatever key you put it on's purpose.\n3. I wanted to limit the text used to text found only inside the spacecraft (mercury, gemini, apollo capsules and shuttle orbiter). While I was able to find a few high resolution photos and schematic documents with proper labelling of the switches, there was no really logical 'x goes well on y' to any of the choices.\n\nIf you think there are clear text options to represent the keys on a keyboard, I think /u/ocloudnine and myself are both open to hearing it and seconding another poll of the graphic novelties and text novelties against each other, or offering two alternate novelty kits (graphic vs. text)
Looking up what I could read of the FCC ID on that NCR board, it might be a rebranded ADI board too - [more here](https://fccid.io/BR88YWKI-6150)
Boy oh boy, I hope you have plans in that same area come [August 21st](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53c358b6e4b01b8adb4d5870/t/57d75c533e00be04a7755888/1473732249458/TSE2017_Oregon)
Purchased two custom cables from /u/90N1NE
It seems the big hang up has been fully assembled boards. I bought a presoldered PCB and case from him last August, and had it in hand by October. Ostensibly it was a long wait, but considering what some people have been through with him, not bad by any means.\n\nThere are some other channels to go through if the primary interest is just the PCB, a few other people use and sell his PCBs, frequently in GBs and I think on a couple sites. As an example, 1upkeyboards.com has 60% and TKL kits which include GoN PCBs.
Hucked an order in there for a pair of 'em! I'll keep an eye out for the invoice.
Not to mention - there are two of us, and Cloud has a much firmer idea for Le Mans. He can focus there and I can focus on another.\n\nAnd that question on the form was just to gauge community interest - in the end, we'll work on what we work on, and I know Cloud is super eager to get Le Mans rolling as his next set.
Yeah, I believe 1upkeyboards.com does use the presoldered boards, so all your left with are switches, switch LEDs and backlight LEDs. You can shoot /u/skiwithpete a message to confirm, or just message them through their site.
Purchased DSA Grab Bag from /u/CatfishChronic
If you were to use clear glass not treated to neutralize the iron tint, are the edges strong enough to show that characteristic green edge? I'd love it with that.
The 7Bit rounds are probably going away. GBs may still continue. We've yet to see what's playing out beyond bits and chunks of what's happening between them and 7bit?

The entire home row, or just the home keys? We've got the home key deep dishes marked in the alpha sets and for the colverak.
Thanks, hopefully we can stir up something about it! We'll have more news about SA NASA soon^TM
But is it as supurb as the razer thang?
Got sand in your undies?
Tap dance ftw :)
Did you ever try Gateron browns? They are about as tactile as mx clears but much smoother and not as heavy.
Yes, just email them, they even make full custom sets to your specifications and the quality is insanely good.
Couldn't be heard over blue switches clicking /s
Can confirm, got one on my board as well. They make beautiful keycaps!
Seeing the quality of that cap just makes me look forward to my cap I ordered from them so much more! Looks absolutely stunning!
Even comes with no friggin caps lock! :\\^)
Cherry MX switches do not have any kind of "break in period" from my understanding. Where are you getting that information from?
That's forward slash, not backslash ;)
If you want to feel the tactile bump more and also have switches that generally feel a bit smoother (not as scratchy), try Gateron browns for your next board ;)
How can I help?
Auch hier Ordnungsgemäß: Keine Zwischenhalte auf dem Weg zum Kanzleramt!
So for browns... you chose... morpheus himself?!

I'm definitely interested!
Is the switch tester gone from the shop? I was planning on ordering one soon...
Where did you find cases? Am I blind?
How do I get my hands on one for myself? :o
Surprise buttsex?
Is it working with that file then? Or do you still have issues? If it works with that, it's probably your compile process that's the issue.
Gotcha! The cases indeed look amazing!
I was indeed wondering but too lazy to figure it out! Thanks!
Can I have one of [these](https://primecaps.ca/collections/earlier-editions-chaos-caps/products/chaos-cap-v1-limes-color-change-from-red-to-yellow-at-72-f-22-c), please? :o
Bullshit and more lies, as always.
I love the look of those! Would love to see how something like that looks like on his custom cases.
They offer all the compatibility you'd ever need, you just have to email them! I got a full custom set for my ISO Tada68 from them without problems! 😊
My "Chaos Caps 1.1 Limes!" came in today. This is probably the one keycap I looked forward to the most so far and it really paid of! Massive shoutout to /u/primecap for custom making the cap for me, I absolutely love it!\n\nAlso, I will have to find a store that sells Hershey here now, because [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/Hersheys-Cookies-n-Creme-Wrapper-Small.jpg) was included in the package as a gift and that chocolate bar was amazing!\n\nEdit: it also changes colors from deep red to the yellow you see in the picture when it gets above 22°C (72°F).
You just email /u/JOWQH at zhh19@zhihaihe.cn\n\nShe's super helpful and nice to deal with :)
No worries, I wish it was more common all over the world!
I'll leave [another XKCD](https://m.xkcd.com/936/) here.
I think Hershey's is not at all that common outside the US?
Can you put some keycaps of the same row profile next to each other? It's hard to get any kind of useful information from different row profiles as is.
I'd be very interested in a build like this!
The cherry stabilizers can have kind of a break in period sometimes, not the switches itself, as far as I'm aware of :)
I ordered mine off amazon.de and didn't have any problems or long waits, came with the correct keycaps and switches. I might just have been lucky though, judging by the reputation corus has these days.
Varmilo caps ♥
me too thanks
Joining raffles is my least favorite thing to do, always leaves me disappointed 🙈
But their service until it's in Europe isn't.
What caps are those?
To each their own, I guess :)
Thanks! :)
That's what I'm wondering as well.
A successor is not something better, it's just something following something else.
Not sure, I got a set for my TADA68.
What's the book key?
& that's why "&" should never be used anywhere apart from company names.
Innovation! I like it :)\n\nI'll follow this project along for sure!
What a lot of people probably mean by that is that lower resistance reduces the slew rate and thus theoretically allows for faster data transfer. That however only affects pins that carry a signal, not the ground connection...
Vernier up the butt! :D
Thanks! :)
[You're welcome](https://xkcd.com/1806/) :P
The default keymap files are always a good starting point in case you messed your custom ones up beyond repair!
White, maybe?
In Europa zahlt man mit Euro Cent. ;)
Awesome to get an insight into their factory! Thank you! I'm lowkey in love with varmilo since I got my custom made keycaps from them!
Alright, much appreciated!

Would be awesome if the plate supported ISO since it looks like the PCB does.

Gateron is just so much better than cherry, one more person confirming it ;)\n\nAwesome board as well, congratulations!
Would it be possible to make one of those style cases for the TADA68? That would be amazing!
Thanks! Looking amazing!
What is/was it used for?
I can definitely recommend Gateron over Outemu any day!

I cringed... have an upvote.
On newer firmware they added the windows key to the combo, so depending on your firmware version one of the combos works.
Looks amazing, really clean! What's the clock you got there on the left?
While it's lame LG is having this issue, why are you not backing up your media? It's stupid-easy with Google Photos. 
If Obama had said even a tenth of what Trump has, the Republicans would have torched the White House. They would have literally crucified him.

I'm about to take an international trip, and for the first time ever I don't want to tell people where I'm from. It's embarrassing. 
"Assistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said an Applebee's bartender called police because Purinton told him he had been involved in a shooting."\n\nIt's funny how racism and catastrophic stupidity seem to go hand-in-hand. 
Gateron or Cherry?
We pay out of pocket for it...a lot. But my wife has a pre-existing condition, so I'm happy to at least be able to buy insurance. If the ACA completely vanished, we'd be pretty screwed. Insurers won't offer her coverage if not required to by law. I just have to hope our progressive state can come up with an alternative system if the worst happens. 
The sad thing is it was actually kind of hard to tell if you missed the bit at the top. This is the world we live in. 
You mean STILL IS, right? 
Yep, the plastic wrap trick is very effective for this sort of issue. I have to do that on most SP sets as their stems tend to be a bit loose. Not a big deal as it's super-quick to do, especially with Cherry stabs. 
"He piles up food onto a plastic plate, and then he suddenly takes off his shirt without explanation. With his bare torso, he sits there and shovels meat into his mouth, a caricature of manliness, but also a show of power to the reporter sitting in front of him. He can do as he pleases.\n\nThen Jones gets up and holds out a sausage. "Wanna suck?" he asks."\n\nWooooooooooooow. If I saw that in a movie I'd think it was ridiculous and unbelievable. 
Nice. Love gat browns. Much smoother than Cherry these days. 
That person might just be wrong. But at any rate, third-party lock screens are a bad idea. They lack the integration with the system to actually protect your data. They can be easily circumvented. Don't use them. 
I don't know what that other guy is talking about. I get notifications with Flamingo. 
Oh, tell me all about how it was a genius 4Chan op, comrade. 
I wrote it. I gave them a few pictures of switches, and they went with that one. Not under my control. I'm typing on lubed 78g Zealios right now, if that makes you feel better. 
So when Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall, he meant American consumers would pay for it? 
In those cases it's usually a consequence of the design. Here, the bezel is a choice. 
If officials can't confirm what someone tells them, then they don't grant the visa. That's how vetting works.  A ban is unnecessary.

I pretty clearly am not making a legal argument. I'm just stating my opinion. 
Anyone with a passport from one of the listed countries. That includes people with tourist, work, and student visas. Also included are permanent US residents with green cards. There's some concern that even people with dual citizenship in the US and one of the banned countries could be affected. No guidance was issued to help agencies interpret the order, which has led to a lot of uncertainty. 
Posting publicly is asking for it. 
Assistant understands better in general and plugs into external services like IFTTT, Phillips Hue, and Nest.
I don't think it's the screen that would prevent Daydream. It wouldn't look great, but it would work. The Snapdragon 625 probably isn't fast enough for Daydream, though. 
I can't even. Those are terrible.
Having tried a lot of switches, I agree MODs are among the most tactile. They're like crisper MX Clears with lighter springs. I still prefer Zealios personally because of the smoother bump, but I can see the appeal of MODs. I'm typing on MOD-Ms right now. 
This is going to start wearing thin for mainstream Republicans who voted for him in hopes of getting their agenda passed. He's genuinely unstable and lost. He's used to managing something he _owns_, which means he can do anything. The presidency obviously comes with a lot more rules than he expected. 
Everything about that tweet is dumb. This has to be parody. 
I have too many GMK sets, but I'll get this if the novelties are good. Love the colors. 
Okay... don't do that. Go to a professional. I've never seen one of these at-home jobs turn out well. This is still fixable, but it won't be if you keep messing around with it yourself. 
Trump is currently wondering if the US even really _needs_ a State Department. What's the worst that could happen?
I assume it has clicky blue switches? Those will always make noise, even with o-rings. It's just how the mechanism works. Your best bet might be to replace the board with something quieter. Maybe brown switches with o-rings.
Yeah, he's more of a urine fan. 
Can't be. In the very same press conference he said he was the least racist person ever. Really, he said that. 
You can see where the ABS didn't flow into all the letters. The edges are rounded too. 
I love the Gmail tabs. They're very accurate for me. 
We're not talking about names, though. Just colors. That's all Hyperfuse is—a colorway. There are no novelties or custom legends. 
Better yet, make the message sound legitimate. Say you spoke to them at the inauguration, and you have to talk more about [legitimate sounding thing]. \n\nMake them waste their time trying to figure out what they forgot. 
Right now in the White House: Trump screaming at everyone, asking why he can't fire the entire State Department. 
I never got anything from mine. I don't think the person I sent a gift to has posted in months, either. 
Yeah, massdrop is not ideal for things you can get elsewhere. It's a good way to get rare things. As questionable as its customer service can be, is better than dealing with some random guy on a forum. 
No one should care if you're not trying to sell them. 
Bought snapper from /u/Rykno. 
Fonts absolutely can be owned. If you're talking about the glyphs in a font, you could technically recreate them and _maybe_ get away with it. This is something that has been litigated for years. You'd be taking a risk. Novelties I'm sure have never been specifically litigated, but I'm just expressing my feeling that they should not be copied. I'm not making a legal argument on that. \n\nSource: I checked with a designer friend who has dealt with this situation.

The ISIS media arm literally said this is what they hoped Trump would do if elected. They know it's going to be great for recruitment. 
So, is everyone sure that sub is legit now? Because last I heard it was sketchy. 
Not yet. PM if interested. 
He could just be using a VPN that doesn't keep records. Or both. 
Yes, I too used to have money. Then keyboards changed my life. 
I don't even understand the perspective of Republican Trumpeters. I'd be _begging_ for impeachment if the situations were reversed and we had just elected a Democrat who had massive conflicts of interest, was probably in bed with a hostile foreign power, and had shown nothing but incompetence while in office. That person can't successfully govern. Best to get them out and hope your party can get back on track. 
Spicer called DeVos an “unbelievably qualified educator and advocate for students, teachers, parents.”\n\nI'm sorry, I must have missed the part where she was an educator. 
Going out on a limb here. You can't own a colorway. If a set is in stupid-high demand and the original GB people aren't interested in running it, someone else should do it. This does not apply to custom fonts or novelties that were designed by someone. They own that work. 
What would Congress do? There's nothing to be done. DHS report confirmed there's no reason to ban travel from these countries. It's just nationalistic BS. 
Just like new things in the timeline? I can't say that's something I've ever wanted or needed. The notification would basically always be there. 
I swear, I'm cursed to never win an ETF raffle. The one Fugu I have was obtained at exorbitant cost on mechmarket.
There was also a separate written question about whether or not Sessions had any contact with Russian officials during the campaign. He said no. So, two instances of what looks a lot like perjury. 
My understanding is the bill would still require insurers to sell to you after a lapse in coverage, but if it's more than 2 months, they have to charge you 30% more as a penalty for one year. Which is... bananas. It disincentivizes coverage until people have a serious medical condition. That's exactly what the ACA was trying to prevent with the mandate. And how are conservatives justifying this? I don't even get it. Forcing a company to raise its prices is a lot more "big government" than enacting a tax penalty. 
Wait, you personally tattooed this on your arm? I'm confused by the language used here. As a tattoo, it looks weird. The lines are jittery and uneven. 
Grow up. 
Looks like there's some weird stuff going on with the bottom row. I don't know off the top of my head what the situation is with this board, but you might have issues with custom keycap sets. 
I'm not really into the design, but I think it'd look rad with something retro like Canvas XDA. 
What color is the judgmental skull on the sides? Can't tell for sure from the pic. 
Hi, that's my keyboard and blog post. It is indeed a TADA68 with MOD-M (I guess they want to call it a Saber now) and an aluminum case. GMK Carbon caps with a snapper. I think this is the third or fourth time one of my posts on AP with visible keyboards ended up here. 
Jesus fucking christ. I guess Trump was wrong when he said he had the best temperament. 
You are correct. All Nougat phones do this. 
Was public support for impeachment ever that high? Republicans in congress were on a mission to impeach him. Didn't matter what anyone else wanted. 
And thanks for your help!
I'm not a Republican, but I don't see why they're still lining up to defend Trump. His administration is such a mess, and he's a clear liability in getting the Republican agenda done. They'd be much more effective with Pence. 
Even if that were true, at a certain point saying terrible things because you think it's funny becomes functionally indistinguishable from actually believing terrible things. 
Hey, we're [keyboard twins](http://imgur.com/a/IT8CI)! Mine is MOD-M, though. 
Yep, this. Even people who have installed the beta that just came out today don't automatically get Assistant. There's something that still needs to happen on Google's end. 
Solid price. GLWS. 
If Republicans _actually_ wanted to stop illegal immigration, they'd push for severe penalties for employers that hire undocumented workers. They don't because it's not really about jobs. It's about xenophobia and racism. 
MOM-M is in interesting switch. The bump is like a sharper version of the Cherry clear. Spring is a bit lighter than that switch, of course. Doesn't seem as smooth as Gateron switches, but I'm not really bothered by it. 
And they'll regret it. History will remember who stood silently by while this was happening.

Yeah, they just got rid of the enantiomer that causes defects. The other one is safe, but lawyers be lawyering.

Legal marijuana has like a 20% approval advantage over Trump. This will not go well for him. 
I think you're misunderstanding. If I create a font and package it for sale or distribution, that font file is protected. Font licensing is a thing. Surely you've seen this. The shapes (i.e. glyphs) inside the font are not in and of themselves protected. You can recreate those glyphs as a "new" font and probably not get sued. You might still though because lawyers. 
I feel like the function row doesn't need to be removable. 
On the plus side, PBT plastic lasts for ages without looking worn. They're a good investment if you're going to use them a lot.

I think you've got it backwards. Voters chose Trump. Now the delegates want to not be held to those voters wishes, like how the Dem's superdelegates work, which is ridiculously undemocratic.

Eh, I don't really agree. The article doesn't dismiss black on black crime, it's simply explaining Trump's tweets and John Lewis' history.\n\nIt sounds like you stopped reading at this point:\n\n>  And while the city has a relatively high violent crime rate, it is almost certainly not as dangerous as Donald Trump...\n\nThe author certainly could have left that out since it's really just arguing semantics, but the problem with Trump's tweets isn't what he said about inner cities, it's that he said that a civil rights hero's opinion is invalid because he hasn't solved crime and poverty. And that's what the article is about, showing how this absurd argument is a common theme throughout history.\n\n> they are a main cause of the short life span of black men\n\n> they are being ignored by absolutely everyone\n\nIs there any evidence to support this?

I got you, bro. Prepare for a mechanical keyboard hand-wiring crash course. \n\nFirst up are a few informative hand-wiring builds. The exact keyboard they're building isn't important. \n\n[Dave Cooper's "I Built a Keyboard From Scratch"](http://gizmodo.com/i-built-a-keyboard-from-scratch-1649325860): His hand-wiring is a bit wobbly, but he explains the overall process well. It's his first keyboard so you can draw some parallels.\n\n[Hand-wired Planck Image Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/yqmKf): Very clean wiring job and helpful close-up shots. \n\n[RoastPotatoes Explains Hand-Wiring](http://blog.roastpotatoes.co/guide/2015/11/04/how-to-handwire-a-planck/): Proper explanation of the wiring process. \n\n[Matt3o's Brownfox Guide](https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/brownfox-step-by-step-t6050.html): This is the guide that made hand-wiring mainstream. \n\n[Matt3o's Firmware Guide](https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/how-to-build-your-very-own-keyboard-firmware-t7177.html): Accompanying piece to his Brownfox build. \n\nIf I could suggest a plan of approach:\n\n1. Plan your layout with [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com). \n\n2. Once you've settled on the layout, copy and paste the raw data into [SwillKB](http://builder.swillkb.com) to generate the plate. When ready, send the plate directly to Lasergist for production.\n\n4. Obtain necessary components. At a minimum, you'll need switches, keycaps, stabilizers, the case, wiring, wire cutter, solder, soldering iron, USB cable, and the Teensy. \n\nI'lll follow up tomorrow with some programming resources, but, hopefully, this is enough for you to decide whether to pursue a hand-wired keyboard or not. \n\nEdit: Let's move onto the programming. I only have experience with using Teensy 2.0, but I found it pretty straightforward. Here's a jumble of thoughts in no particular order. \n\n- Make sure it's the smaller 2.0 version. It has less pins which limits how many rows/columns you can have overall, which in turn affects things like how many keys/LEDs you can have, but it'll fit better in the case. \n\n- There are two big advantage to using the Teensy as your keyboard's brain; firstly, builds using the Teensy have been thoroughly documented already, and secondly, you can flash [QMK](http://qmk.fm), which is a fully programmable , open-source firmware that expands on [TMK](http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard). \n\n- If the actual programming is not something you want to deal with, you can use [TMK Firmware Builder](http://kb.sized.io) to generate the necessary .hex files to flash to your Teensy. \n\n- The method to programming and flashing .hex files to your board varies based on your operating system. QMK has pretty [good instructions](http://qmk.fm/#build-environment-setup) on how to set up your environment. Generally, you need a .hex file that details what each key does as well as any fancy logic or programming. You then initiate the flashing process on your computer and press the Teensy's reset button to confirm. Simple enough, yes?\n\n- I do the actual programming part with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com). Tabbed interface is useful to open multiple files at once, and it has automatic syntax highlighting. \n\n- In Win10, you can install the [Anniversary Patch](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/amp/?client=safari) to gain access to Bash Shell. It'll let you use "make" to generate your .hex files. Then you drag the .hex to reflash.bat to flash it. \n\n- In Mac/Linux, you can set up your environment to use "make dfu" instead, which will generate the .hex and flash it in one step. \n\n- Here are some really neat QMK features to check out: [Space Cadet Shift](http://qmk.fm/#space-cadet-shift-the-future-built-in), [Leader Keys](http://qmk.fm/#the-leader-key-a-new-kind-of-modifier), and [Tap Dance](http://qmk.fm/#tap-dance-a-single-key-can-do-3-5-or-100-different-things).\n\n- I assign a keyboard "reset" to a key combination so that I don't have to constantly flip the keyboard over to reach the reset button.\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head for now. Good luck, guys!

and here i am having the worst work day ever at a damn smoothie shop. i envy you amd your ability to grow. tx hopefully will be legal one day. 
i was lookin for your comment brother 
im in a+ class rn, this is funny! 
i really need to pick up the 3ds version, its an exact remake! my first gme when n64 launched was smash bros but then starfox, glover, pokestadium and goldeneye
looks spikey... i want it. 
i hate to ask, but where did this big if true shit start, meme-wise. or do all of you just say it. 
rough, but i love it. hairs dope too
thanks man, i really thought it was a baby lol
oh shit lol. when i saw it looked like sometbing below it had caught fire and made burn marks
updoots for that BoC vinyl. man and all that gear, i bet i could talk to you for ages lol. nice setups homie! 
man if they were to just print patterns like this on the actual label on the vinyl. some band should do that. 
n64!!! 
wish i could do this, its been my dream for years. sadly the premade backlit ones are well over my budget
im really sad now
dammit starfox 64 get your facts straight!
i need a whole board with creamy led
thats a knappyy ass duck yo
... yes. 
ive done it all too besides the bug, 
best one yet
pretty sure they knew eachother
hell yeah, i also need a new metroid game to come out on switch, then id buy. a real one like zero mission or fusion. not that crap they put out on gamecube or wii. 
wow stunning work!! she fiiiine. 
un fucking real. hed have to roll pretty much exactly down his spine with just the right amount of curve. fucking black magic alrighy. 
lemme get a triple double with cheese and uhhh
HOW COULD YOU FORGET GUY LE DOUCHE!? 
whaaaat, thats wierd. 
wow, dope
right? it went straight back, yet her hand was blocking it idk. maybe /r/blackmagicfuckery needs to take a look.

what a quick lesson
sad, hope he finds a new lady and she fixes herself up
i smoke pot too
cool as fuck, lioneering the hobby here! id lose that ball in a heartbeat tho
as a sig150tc owner since forever, i want your mod
i got real far. my mom and i would take turns playing too. i got pretty far in exile and riven too, i just lost interest eventually. ive played through real:myst now and it was such a nostalgia trip. myst the longest journey and phantasmagoria, i miss the ol days. 
they sell it at walmart, quality is no where near other companies that charge wayyy less for their stuff. its just bland boring and bleh. ive had razer headset and jeyboard in the past and both crapped out so quick. i dont shun people for using razer, just hope tyey soon find the light. 
soo this the new Rocket League dlc? 
You need DragonsDogma:Dark Arisen. i have piled hundreds of hours into it. Great game for a souls fan, its by the DMC team. 
A critical hit! 
i always thought megan fox looked like the fakest most boring chick ever. 1000 celebs hotter than her, but the world flipped when she rose to fame.  
dudes wearin shades while edgin
he means "me too thanks" 
wow, nice tap, very satisfying to watch. 
hahagood shit man
 imgur comments are infamous for being trashy, no worries op
i gon win :3
hey man can you pass me my pliers down there? 
this is my swamp. 
those guys are the ones who ruined it for everyone. i got what i needed out of vaping tho, im good. 
imma just make my own big shirt with the image, fuck that
then they got bought by Spencers right? 
oh the good ol days, before memes
sid_irl
thats a toasty cmos
Been dreaming of a sleek led spinner for quite sometime now. gonna pass on this though, the tech needs to be a bit smaller for me to buy. i know the click light is a special design by them, but that spinner looks too damn big. stoked to see wbo elae makes one. i always thought that tritium would be better for spinners, costly though. 
my favorite sub <3
i rented it from Randalls one time. one of the coolest  n64 games lol. trippy tho. i also miss gex, another wierd but cool one.  
dont feed the troll
wateva i dowat i wann
thats so fucking cool. i want a longboye mat with more trainer cards on it. id pay money. 
word, i smoke alot of pot so thats what has mostly kept me off everything :) i miss cigs tho, its been a few years since ive had one. 
i kekd
im dying laughing
ducky master race!! man i always flip seeing real torqbars so jelly
this was my shit as a kid. aside from newgrounds, albinoblack sheep, ebaumsworld and fat-pie. man those anti auto theft ones were the best!! 
ever girl loves a man who can handle his rattleback. 
idk that doll doeant look like hers tho lol
i still have so much respect for the dude knowing how well he skates. 
i picked up the boxset at a halfprice books for $3, flipped out went home and had such a nostalgia rush. best show ever.

damn.... 
Zeal60 PCB designer here: I actually recommend making clearance on the case rather that the PCB, if possible. Cases that support "custom" 60% PCBs like Zeal60, NeRD 60, etc. have clearance in the case. Cases that were designed to work with surface mount USB connectors (i.e. Satan) will have no clearance for PCB protrusions needed for through-hole USB sockets.\n\nSo if it was my "cheap 60% case", I'd break out the Dremel and a tungsten carbide bit and grid off enough from the inside of the case (around the USB cutout) so that it fits. Or just make the USB cutout a little bit "taller", like it is on a TEX 60% case.\n
The thing to note from that picture is that he is suggesting you only shave the PCB down to the point where the first set of legs on the USB port are. Not to shave it down to flush with the plate.
As an expensive alternate solution, TEX cases have enough clearance for PCBs with reinforced USB ports like Zeal60/NerD. 
https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=84248.msg2334409#msg2334409\n\nyou can
I opted to file down the inside of the port on my aluminum case, worked great.
As advised by others, it would be better to file/grind the case port cutout, or purchase a higher quality custom cnc'd case that's meant for housing PCBs that have reinforced USB connectors. SMD mini USB connectors are notorious for breaking easily (pokers, gh60 satans etc), which is why we opt to use semi through hole connectors. \n\nTex, custom Korean 60%s etc all have the appropriate clearance for the cutout. Cheaper cases found on Aliexpress and similar are modelled after GH60 Satan PCB. 
Needs moar chamfer. Like dis:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pAMzv7h.jpg\n
To clarify, it's the PCB protrusion, not the USB port itself. Can I shave it down flush with the aluminum plate?
I use tweezers or a piece of wire. A paper clip will work too. \n\nI recommend this app as well: https://elitekeyboards.com/switchhitter.php
Or just because it looks cool?\n\nhttps://flic.kr/p/PTVTGx\n\n

Man, I was hoping for a bit of witty repartee to liven up a slow afternoon, but it seems you're just out of your depth. Go back to the kiddie pool. Don't forget your floaties.
lol vinny, vinny... don't follow me down this rabbit hole.... get out now while you can ;-)
I switched easily from TKL to HHKB layout. Pinky Fn + HHKB arrow keys were easy to adapt to. Still don't use Home/End as much as before, and I use right key of the "split backspace" as Del always.\n\nAs long as you have full control of key layout, you can tailor it to suit your needs. That's what I think makes the switch possible (for me).
If you mean one with a trackpad, I doubt it's the case I'm looking for. Thanks anyway.
No problem, just on the lookout for a Dolch PAC case for a custom PCB in it. I don't have the heart to desolder these vintage blues, but would like an 1800 layout with Zealios one day... ;-)
Beautiful build and an interesting layout. 
The breakout was to show you how to use that LED driver, get a test harness going if you want. Obviously you'd have to make your own PCB to suit the application.
I find the easiest way is to do it in three steps:\n\n1. Solder a blob of solder onto one pad.\n2. Solder a blob of solder onto the other pad.\n3. Put soldering iron tip in between pads and feed solder onto tip until the blob joins the other two blobs.\n
Hey, wanna come over for some SolidWorks and chill?\n\n
Which one?
It is most likely this: [E-Switch TL3342F160QG](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/e-switch/TL3342F160QG-TR/EG2531CT-ND/379004)  \n\nIf you only need it occasionally, you can just short the pins to fake pressing the button... use a piece of wire or metallic tweezers and touch two pins on the shorter side simultaneously.\n\n
Cool, someone actually built this ISO.\n\nHey ANSI Zeal60 users, this is why you have half a switch pad on \\ | and your Holtite doesn't work well there. No witchhunts. Just saying.... ;-)\n\n
Oh well. \n\nHere's some help: use tantalum for caps >= 1μF on your power rails... those ISSI drivers make ceramic ones buzz like crazy.
Nice one. 
Run the EK Switch Hitter app.\n\nCheck it's working with another keyboard.\n\nPlug in Zeal60. Short the pads that the pins of a switch would go into by touching both pads (the gold part around the hole) simultaneously with the ends of a piece of wire. \n
Yes. And I don't remember. Even if I did, the answer would be irrelevant.
Thanks. It's cool to see it being used in all sorts of cases, especially ones I've drooled over myself.\n\nTusing did a guide for attaching RGB strips: https://gist.github.com/tusing/b9e58480d67a9f3e5932ba27096643c6\n\n

Dam son. That's a nice keeb.
Zeal60 designer here... I assumed people didn't really want (or need) LEDs turned off if they were under a blocker. I use an HHKB layout with a TEX case and HHKB plate:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Jd4V3C6.jpg\n\nand I like the glow that comes out there, since it matches the glow coming through the gap between the plate and the bezel elsewhere. I think I tried turning it off once and it looked odd.\n\nI'll have a think about it and might put in another option into the backlight settings. Short term workaround would be put some black electrical tape over the LEDs. Not a very elegant solution, I know...\n
Yeah I don't know... I've only used them on a couple of positions on my Zeal60 (like the caps lock) where I may want to swap. I've yet to build a full board with them. I'll be doing a full evaluation with the Zeal65 PCB ;-)
Easiest way is to put a resistor in series with each LED. For example, anode -> resistor -> 5V  and  cathode -> GND. Or alternatively, anode -> 5V  and cathode -> resistor -> GND.\n\nIf you want them controlled by the Teensy, then instead of ground, connect to the collector of an NPN transistor, emitter to GND, base -> 1K -> Teensy pin. Pref. a PWM pin of the Teensy so you can use hardware PWM to control brightness. This is how it's done with a lot of PCBs like Planck, JD45, NeRD 60. Check out QMK for more details.\n\n*EDIT* you want to use approx. 470 ohm or 510 ohm resistor per LED depending on your LED type and desired current.\n
I also got two of these cases to build with Zeal60. I'm actually recommending increasing the cutout hole rather than shave the PCB edge.
This might help: https://deskthority.net/wiki/Space_bar_dimensions\n\nI don't know what size spacebar you're using, but if you stick to using the positions found on Cherry keyboards, you're good for keycap compatibility and stabilizer wires.\n\nNote for the Cherry 6.25U spacebar mounts, use the center mount for the switch, not the other one close to center. That actually aligns with where the 7U switch mount would be, if you were putting both 6.25U and 7U on the same PCB (i.e. 1.25/1.25/1.25/6.25 vs. 1.5/1/1.5/7)\n
Seriously? I linked an Adafruit breakout with instructions how to use it. Look there for answers.

> Unfortunately you cannot remap anything in the FN1 layer\n\nWTF? I thought the most essential feature of a 40% was full control of layers.
Noice.\n\nBTW... I'm probably going to keep the layouts in the [Zeal60 QMK fork](https://github.com/Wilba6582/qmk_firmware/tree/zeal60) fairly limited for now, at least until I refactor the source to work with Zeal65 PCB and publish the GUI tool. Unless your "source code based" QMK layout has something that *can't* be done with the .bat file version, there really isn't any point storing them all in github - just use the supplied .hex file and the .bat files to tweak your layout.\n\nPeople are welcome to submit their layouts (the .bat file versions) to the [github for the configuration tool](https://github.com/Wilba6582/zeal60) or just send them to me if you're not a github user ;-)\n\nAll user-submitted layouts will be packaged with the GUI-based configuration tool coming Soon^^TM\n
Can't limit pulse current. Can only limit average current with PWM. Which is why I don't like to use them.
I think you need to desolder and remove the LEDs first. Then you can try unclipping the switch using the little clips on the top and bottom edges.
http://i.imgur.com/szmKecu.gif
Yes, another user had the same issue with a case from AliExpress. I recommended sanding down the edge of the PCB like this:\n\n http://i.imgur.com/aolQCBN.jpg \n\nAnother option is to make some clearance on the inside of the case.\n\nThe problem comes from those case designers only allowing for PCBs with surface mount USB sockets like a Satan GH60, and not ones with that PCB nub and through-hole mount USB sockets like a Gon NeRD 60.\n\n\n
I got one a while back and it was my daily driver for a long time. If you're interested in selling off your non-working ones, send me a PM ;-)
It's more like 16,777,216 colors  = 256^3\n\nBut if you factor in the luminosity correction, it's only 5,268,024 = 174^3\n\nWouldn't want to lie about it like the K70 RGB. It's definitely NOT 512 = 8^3\n\n\n
So cute. 
But change keymaps without needing to build QMK :O
Are you trying to take off the PCB in one go? I don't think that's going to work well. Better to unclip each switch from the plate one at a time, then you'll find the ones that are still being held by tiny bits of solder.
just the tip, and only for a minute
You should be fine. GH60 and others put a tactile switch under that big ass hole as a way to reset into bootloader mode and flash with new firmware.\n\nFor PCBs that don't put a switch there (like Zeal60), as long as you don't poke conductive things in the hole, you should be fine.\n\nSometimes that big ass hole comes in handy, like when you need to solder a big ass electrolytic to your prototype PCB because you forgot to order the right SMD parts lol\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IfGnH4b.jpg\n
Zealencios - for when your quick bursts of coding frenzy sounds like an AK-47 because you're a hack typist and bottom out like crazy, and you've already reached your quota of colleague annoyance by daring to bring in a mechanical keyboard.\n\n9/10, 10/10 with rice.
That's a nice combo... like a neon sign around the edge, continuing the 50's theme of Jukebox. Cool.
Shameless plug:\n\n[Zeal60 PCB](https://zealpc.net/collections/accessories/products/zeal60rgb) has split right-shift and split backspace, Winkey/Winkeyless bottom row and ISO support. Open-source firmware, uses [a fork of QMK](https://github.com/Wilba6582/qmk_firmware/tree/zeal60), users can program a pre-built firmware and configure keymaps/backlight settings via a host app, or compile their own QMK firmware with keymaps, macros, custom backlight effects, whatever.\n\nAlso, studies have shown that exposure to unicorn vomit RGB lighting effects increases your libido to over 9,000.\n\n\n\n\n

Assuming everyone here is involved with, and participates in drama.\n\nLet's summarize the situation: some people don't like being screwed over, they paid money for something that has not been delivered for years, and have a bitch about it. Other people side with them, and are critical of the situation and comment on it. So what? This is the internet. You should be allowed to express how you feel about stuff, just like you're allowed to shitpost like this, and I'm allowed to shitpost in reply and say take a dose of your own medicine and stop perpetuating the drama with calls to stop perpetuating drama.\n
Nicely done, esp. the LED strip mod.
Yes.
Needle files, or Dremel with a tungsten carbide bit.\n\nI did a quick test fit when I got the cases, looks like the top edge of the cutout needs to be about 1mm higher so the PCB has clearance.\n\nFWIW this is an issue with all custom 60% PCBs that use USB connectors with through-hole mount pins and need a tiny protrusion of PCB.
Pins that go into the pads to make the switches hot-swappable.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5a399o/guide_how_to_make_your_pcb_hotswappable/\n\n
I don't either, sorry.
AND MY AXE!
FWIW I code for a living, and do PCB design, case design, and code for fun. I thought I couldn't go smaller than a TKL, but now use a 60% for everything. You notice pretty quickly how often (or seldom) you use the function keys and even arrow keys.\n\nHOWEVER I built a custom 60%, with the case, switches, layout and keymaps that I want. I doubt I would have enjoyed, let alone adapted to a 60% otherwise.

Yeah good guess, 100mm should work fine for a 6.25U.\n

Great idea! Thanks!
The LED package is irrelevant. The LEDs we chose on Zeal60 (i.e. mounted under the PCB) solve the problem of through-hole RGB LEDs inside the switch being too large and interfering with Cherry profile keycaps, but also because it illuminates the whole switch when transparent (which some people prefer) in low-profile cases.\n\nAlso if you're interested, I'll leave this here: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2946\n
It might be approximately the same current going through the UV LEDs vs. the original white, but LED brightness varies by type, and AFAIK UV LEDs are emitting most of their light in the invisible UV part of the spectrum.\n\nThe UV LEDs may have appeared brighter using your jerry rigged 3V power source because you were powering them at a high current (you didn't mention using a current limiting resistor) and the current per LED on a keyboard is much lower, possibly 6mA.\n
Use thin solder. I use 0.56mm thickness for everything. It helps control the amount. Don't be afraid to do it in two steps... one to fill in a switch pad hole, one to make a nice cone-shaped joint onto the pin. As long as you don't heat the pin for too long each time (<2 seconds) and let it cool off in between, you can control the exact size and shape of the final joint.
It depends on the application. And I'm sure there are RGBW LEDs without ICs, just haven't bothered to look for them.
Yeah I misread your original post... I thought you had a regular plate with switch cutouts in the corners and had easy access to the LED. No worries, I'll fix that this weekend. Nag me if there's not a release by Monday ;-)
Niceu. Builds like this are why I left clearance for fat ribs on the PCB. #texmasterrace

Those overpriced PCBs of which you speak are designed by me.\n\nGood luck doing chargebacks or PayPal disputes after months of waiting.\n\nYou've missed the point completely. You are the one perpetuating drama by telling other people to just "chill out".\n\n\n
LOL yeah, well I also value my Zeal60 prototype PCBs more than some cheap case from China.

For not much more, you can get a [Hakko FX-888D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1204)\n\nI have used one for years for everything. It is the soldering iron of legends (and arrogant assholes like me). Having trouble heating up a fat pin and a ground plane pad? Say no more, fam, crank it up to 11.\n\nThis thing is dope and with it you will do dope things.\n\n*drops mic*
Seriously awesome photography. You managed to capture the LED glow and keyboard details at the same time, which I struggle to do.\n\nFWIW pic #6 shows random default "custom" key colors... I made them random so people would know which mode it was when they weren't set, but that looks so nice, I should make an effect which is totally random colors. 
RELEASE THE SCHMOO!
Holtites work best when "soldered in", which is easy for PCBs with HASL pads (i.e. silver colored), just push them in with a soldering iron. But that doesn't work with ENIG pads (i.e. gold plated) like the Zeal60. That technique can work if you add a bit of solder to the inside of the hole and then remove it with a desoldering pump (aka. solder sucker).\n
Look at the ATMega32U4 datasheet. Find other examples of using I2C with ATMega32U4. There are plenty of examples out there.\n\nIf you ask specific advice I can help. Like "should I use pullups on SDA/SCL?" and I might say "Yeah I use 4.7K". But you're going to have to research this yourself. I'm not teaching you electronics or drawing you a schematic.
It's a metal paperclip, right?\n\nCheck that it's showing up as a Zeal60 keyboard in your devices. Copy/paste this into an Explorer window address bar: Control Panel\\\\Hardware and Sound\\\\Devices and Printers\n
not needed
Not sure what you mean... The options are a) microcontroller drives the LEDs directly using transistors etc. for high current, requires lots of pins or I/O expander ICs, b) microcontroller drives an LED matrix driver, which handles things like brightness per LED using PWM, or c) microcontroller drives a "chain" of LEDs with integrated PWM ICs (like WS2812) as used in RGB LED strips.\n\nI use option b) on Zeal60/Zeal65 so you can use any LEDs you like, be they 4-pin through-hole RGB or SMD.
I used to think 60% is too small for coding, but I adapted quickly. Eclipse uses less function keys than Visual Studio, but even when I'm debugging in VS, it's pretty easy to get F8-F12 with just one hand, even left handed while I use the mouse with the right hand. I'm using a HHKB-style layout on a custom 60% PCB/case.\n\nWhat makes it work (for me) is total customization of layout, and I use the mouse a lot as well, so having the mouse *so damn close* to the keyboard is pretty awesome.\n
Don't know of any on the market (other than the Z70 which is 65% and non-standard layout). If you really want something like this, it's possible to build a custom 60% like this - get an existing case, make a hole in the side for a USB cable and solder it to the PCB. Some PCBs have pads for an alternate USB connection, like B.face X2, Zeal60, maybe some other ones.\n
http://i.imgur.com/BuCZZ1i.gif
I'm biased because I designed Zeal60 and I like Zealios. It's a trade-off, but if you want a switch that's not available in transparent/translucent base, you could make them, e.g. http://blandname.com/2017/01/14/zeal60-zealencio-zealiostotle-jspacer-holtite-build/\n\n
I've got two. Still unbuilt, but the quality was surprisingly good for the price. The only issue I have is the USB cutout is too small for custom 60% PCBs (like NeRD 60, Zeal60, B.face) that use USB connectors with through-hole mount pins and have a little bit of PCB protrusion. You will need to Dremel a bit of clearance for the PCB protrusion. (I haven't done this myself yet but I don't think it's too hard to do).
Yes.
Great build!\n\n> Nothing I could find actually had the proper mounting standoffs for the Zeal60 PCB, most were of the “Poker” variety, which were missing top screw standoffs, as well as one lower-left.\n\nThe Zeal60 PCB has mount holes to cater for as many cases as possible, with mount holes in positions found on other PCBs like NeRD and B.face X2. There's probably not a case out there that supports all mount holes on the PCB.\n\n> The Sentraq case with the Zeal60 is not without problems: both cases prohibited me from screwing in the leftmost PCB screw\n\nI'd be interested to know more about why the screw wouldn't fit. The PCB has a mount hole to fit the "Poker" mount which is common to many cases. I'm asking because I'm the designer of the Zeal60 PCB and wondering how I can change that mount hole to suit Sentraq cases in the next production.
Keep yer dick in a vice.
¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Autorouters suck. I cannot teach you how to route. You just have to learn by doing. 
Ahh you're still running the test firmware. Program it with the zeal60_default.hex and try again.
I've discussed this issue with OP - the slots on the Zeal60 PCB rev 1 aren't long enough. Rev 2 will include longer slots, like they are on the NeRD 60 PCB.\n

Yup, I actually started this thread hoping for a monitoring tool suggestion! Everyone is suggesting PlexPy, which I'll install as soon as I get a chance. Thanks for replying!
Take a look at QMK's [Space Cadet Shift](http://qmk.fm/#space-cadet-shift-the-future-built-in). Essentially, if you tap left shift, you get '('. If you tap right shift, you get ')'. It doesn't affect what the shift keys are assigned to do when they're held down.
Great! I should have tried that before laying out all the keys with mouse clicks. Thanks for such an awesome tool!
No problem! Keeping a healthy tank can be a bit 'mystical', but also very rewarding. You may get cloudy water (it'll clear up over time), algae (adjust lighting intensity/duration or dose Flourish Excel), or spikes in ammonia/nitrite (new tank syndrome can last about 8 weeks).  It may start up rocky at first, but be patient. Generally, time to get established is all it needs. Let me know if you have any questions.
Sure thing! Also, I've been seeing more layouts completely using SA R3 too. Kind of like a tall DSA layout. That's also a possibility.
That's a great idea actually! Unfortunately, I think the screw standoffs are likely to not fit with ortholinear because they're placed between staggered switches. You can hand-wire your own, but I think the size of the matrix will be too much for the usual Teensy. But I like the idea! I'll prep a top and bottom plate, and see how much it would cost to fabricate a simple sandwich case.\n\nEdit: Yikes. [Top plate and matching bottom plate](http://imgur.com/hJJUtqH.jpg) out of 1.5mm steel is roughly $100. I'm still tempted.
PM'ing
As a follow up, I managed to install PlexPy and did some looking into transcoding performance. Checking the log for "speed =>" shows good performance all around with an average of 7.x at 720p. Maybe the performance issue really is a network issue then. I didn't think that was likely since my server seems to be fully reachable from outside the network and my 200Mbps/20Mbps speeds should be fast enough. Any ideas on where to poke around next?
PM'ing
[DSA Think Different](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-think-different-keycap-set/) but it's around $100 to get the full 104 keyset.
The GH60 is a pretty good starter pcb. It's not as expensive as others, fits on nearly all 60% cases, offers multiple layouts, and is QMK compatible. You won't need anything more on the pcb to make it function besides switches/stabilizers/plate/case. LEDs if you want the bling. \n\nAs far as stabilizers go, Cherry stabs are installed between the pcb and plate, making them impossible to access after you solder the switches, but have the advantage of being neater on the top-side. You can swap long keycaps by just pulling them off. \n\nOn the other hand, costar mounts are installed above the plate and the mechanism is completely visible, making them easy to access, but swapping keycaps involve prying the keys off of the wire. 
What about a [Gherkin](http://www.40percent.club/2016/11/gherkin.html)? I'm not sure if the PCB is currently available though. \n\n
I'd be interested as well.
That would mean to get to FN2, you need to hold two keys. That might be okay, but your FN and FN2 are also using both hands, which is also slightly inconvenient. Have you looked into SpaceFN? It's a feature where you can assign a tap role and a held-down role to the same key. In this case, tapping space will give you a regular space, while holding space down can access FN2. You lose the ability to do repeated spaces by holding it down, but it's a good FN key because it's accessible by both thumbs. Tab and return are good candidates as well since those keys aren't really ever held down. 
Thanks for the reply. My users are running the full gamut: browsers on Windows/Mac, Android phones, iPhones, iPads, Roku, Amazon Fire Stick. I was trying to figure out how to modify my setup to ensure direct streaming works, thereby preventing transcoding. Maybe I should run some tests with videos from the internal drive vs the USB3 drive. If it's possible to transode videos at playback speed on the internal drive, that might be solution enough. In terms of streaming quality, I've asked them all to try lower bitrates, but they're still encountering buffering. I think the USB3 drive may really be the culprit. \n\nEdit: Is there a way to tell when something is being transcoded? Or logs to see performance bottlenecks?
I'm in the exact same boat as you, but replace 'grandfather' with 'brother'. I was able to get a code and was going to upgrade to the new MotoX, but my brother needs a new phone much more than I do, so I gave it to him. Sigh.\n\nAs far as upgrading, one thing I wouldn't base my decision on is upgrading for the sake of Lollipop since it'll be coming to our 2013 MotoX eventually. Aside from that, the increased battery size translates to slightly more onscreen time (until they optimize it further), much better performance (but not current top tier), and better build quality. The metal-edged chassis in particular appeals to me since my MotoX has hairline fractures along the chamfered edges. \n\nI would say the biggest differentiators would be the screen size and improved camera. If you want a bigger screen, it's a good opportunity. 
I would to, except out of all the colors, that one is the one I like the least. -__-
This is the closest I've found to a guide, but there aren't any specifics in terms of dimensions. Handy tools to have would be tablesaw, router, and drill press, but you could make do with a circular saw, router, hand drill. \n\n[How-To: 60% Mechanical Keyboard Wood Case Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EscRF8L0X5E)\n\nLeave the wood blank overly long on the dimensions to give the router some support to ride on. Use the router with a pattern bit to hollow out the bed for the PCB. Then make the cuttouts for the usb connector and the dipswitch, and drill the holes for the mounting screw standoffs (8mm M2 brass standoffs are only $1 or 2 for a small set on ebay). Then trim to final dimensions. \n\nI was working on mine just last night, but my a few of my screw holes are off by 1-2 mm...
Bought 1 x Pok3r from /u/a9udn9u.
Research at GH has led me to this [TaoBao item](https://world.taobao.com/item/542300386181.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.UcGK1p). It's small enough to embed inside the case alongside the Teensy, and converts the keyboard to bluetooth while allowing usb passthrough and charging. I'm wondering if it's possible to hook up the Teensy and lipo battery to this chip directly.
This is a long shot, but maybe you can try [reflashing](https://www.keychatter.com/2015/07/05/programming-the-kc60/) the stock keymap? Uncustomized, you should only have access to three layers: QWERTY, FN, and 10Key. I don't believe there's a way to get stuck on a layer with no way to get back to QWERTY, but the reflashing would be a way to 'restore' the KC60 to stock settings. It's also compatible with [QMK](http://qmk.fm/) which is what I recommend because it's in English and has many many more features.
Neat! What about using countersunk flat head screws to keep the overall appearance a little cleaner?

Thanks for the reply, sirrush7.\n\nI haven't had a chance to install PlexPy like suggested above, but I just tested a video from the internal 7200rpm drive. Same issues make it unplayable. Even stranger, I moved to the actual server pc to watch it, and the video kept booting me out of playback and back to the episode info screen. I had to open the actual file from Explorer to watch it. \n\nConfirming that the media server is connected via LAN cable while clients are on various home wifi and mobile. \n\nBack when I first built the pc, it ran Windows 8, SABNzbd, Sickbeard, and CouchPotato. Experience was passable for most users and unusable for a few, but I could never iron out the playback kinks. Couple of months back, I did a fresh format with Windows 10, NZBGet, Sonarr, and CouchPotato thinking a fresh setup with updated software might fix it. That seems to be when the real trouble started.
Yup! Paul Sellers wrote about doing this exact thing too ([back in 2011](https://paulsellers.com/2011/11/4473/)). I still haven't gotten around to doing this to my set yet. 
Hi, SentrantPC. Would it be possible to order light alphas and dark mods? I've been trying to get some XDA to test.
Just stopping by to comment that this hobby is amazing (sorry, wallet). In a thread about a broken stabilizer, the first two people to help are /u/evangs, of MiniVan fame, and /u/jchan94, of KeyClack/artisan fame. That's crazy. \n\nBack to topic. It looks like the stabilizer could be broken in two places: (1) the clip holding it onto the PCB, and possibly (2) the part that holds the wire. If it's just (1), a dab of hot glue to solidify the broken clip should work. If its also (2), then you'll probably want to follow evangs' advice and desolder the board to replace the clip properly. This is one of the drawbacks with cherry-style stabilizers. They do make keycap swapping easier, and aesthetically, I like the look of no wires.\n\nI was actually the fourth person to join the MiniVan drop at MassDrop, but had to back out due to financial reasons. So sad...
Ouch. Your username carries so much more meaning having read that story. 
Welcome to the hobby! \n\nIf you are unsure about what type of switch to get, you can start with a switch tester. That'll get you halfway there as playing with one switch is quite different from typing on a whole board, but it's a good way to feel the difference between linear, tactile, and clicky switches. 
I had trouble with my Zeal60 fitting into my AliExpress case. Yours seems to fit okay?
If you're looking for lighter actuation on the mods, maybe just swap the springs for those switches? That way, they retain the stem-feel and visual aesthetic.

Yeah, I was able to fix the columns with the new adjustment section. That's very handy! With regards to the pin display, I'm finding it useful as a tool to plan the wiring ahead of time, which is a bit backwards. Haha. I can see how displaying them wouldn't be particularly helpful if you've already completed the wiring. But I do think displaying them on the pin section is a good idea.\n\nFor possible future improvements and to make it easier to layout keymaps, would it be able to read user key presses and assign inputs to selected keys? 
Ah, true. I forget Vortex keyboards aren't fully programmable. My idea would need something like TMK/QMK.
**The short:**  \n\nYou can completely customize your keyboard by creating your own layers and keymaps. Any keys, anywhere, on multiple layers. Also, programmability for some advanced features (like SpaceFN, Space Cadet Shift, Vim's Leader Keys, etc.).  \n\n**The long:**  \n\nTo expand a bit, let's say you've gotten accustomed to using Pok3r's layout, but want to build your own hand-wired keyboard, or want to get a Planck/other programmable keyboard. You can relatively easily create a keymap that mimics the same layers from the Pok3r. From there, it's just as easy to make your own custom tweaks, custom macros, etc.  \n\nFor me, part of the fun is working with a living layout that's constantly adapting to my workflow and habits. Never used capslock, so I turned it into a modifier key. Holding it down turns I/J/K/L into arrow keys, and number keys into snippets that hold text that I type frequently, like my email address. 
Yup, there are various samplers out there. [This one is all Cherry MX](https://www.amazon.com/WASD-6-Key-Cherry-Switch-Tester/dp/B00AZQKCD4). I would also not discount Gateron as they're very very close. [This one is a bit expensive but offers both Cherry MX and Gateron](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-keycap-cherry-mx-switch-gateron-switch-o-ring-ultimate-sampler-tester-kit.html). What I would do, is just get the Cherry MX tester to get a feel for the differences in linear vs tactile vs clicky. Then you can choose Cherry MX Reds (linear), or Brown (tactile), or Blue (clicky). The Chroma you have is either clicky or tactile. Good luck!
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll install PlexPy as soon as I get a free evening.\n\nBack when I first built the PC, all my research lead me to believe the i3 was capable of handling at least a few streams of 720p transcoding, which was all I needed it to do. And if 200Mbps/20Mbps bandwidth isn't enough, I might as well scrap the whole sharing idea, because faster than that isn't feasible unless I move to somewhere with Google Fios...
No problem. I think you provide a great service to the mechanical keyboard community.
Nice setup! With the amount of effort you've put into it so far, I'm pretty sure you have Plex Pass, yes? If you do, enabling syncing for offline viewing would be one way to enhance your users' experiences.
That's awesome of you! I just managed to snag one about 5 minutes ago from the slickdeals thread : ). Thanks though!
Very nice extension! Going to start using it at work. : )\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that in radio mode, the current song is displayed beneath the fold. That means when I want to add it to a playlist, I have to do a baby-scroll to access the right buttons. I imagine this was intentional as the song is already displayed at the top of the column. \n\nSuggested fix: show the songs in descending order with current song at the top and previous songs listing downwards. Also, keep the same rollover treatment and add the play/save/delete buttons to the current playing song. This would save having to show the song twice, as well as being more intuitive and consistent. Or alternatively, keep the ascending order and place the player at the bottom of the column with play/save/delete button functionality. \n\nGood work, MeoMix!
Thanks for the info, alose! I actually ended up buying a TEX case off /r/mechmarket because it was confirmed to fit. Lol. 
Yup. Checkout the second to last image. It shows a perfectly centered 1, 1, 1, spacebar, 1, 1, 1. Reprogrammable with 6 function layers. Aluminum case and plate. BUT, it seems like the max orders is capped at 30, which may have been hit already. Also, Massdrop is going to drop the revised [Minivan R2](https://www.massdrop.com/talk/209/mini-van-r-2-keycaps-feedback-update) later this month for ~$200. Not centered spacebar, but definitely worth a look.
Hm. You're right. I was mistaken to think it was a wrap-around cover. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHA0EdFhZ8
Yup. Planing's end goal is to get something perfectly flat and square (two meeting edges at 90°), whether it's for joinery or a show-face. To get a bit deeper, it could be divided into phases. The first phase is rough removal to get the wood close to the desired dimensions. The second phase is to take shallower cuts with a more accurate plane to get things level/parallel/flat/square. Finally, if it's a show side, the third phase is finishing with a smoothing plane which removes minimal material but erases any irregularities from the previous phases and preps it for finishing. It takes a bit of practice to be able to do all this with reasonable accuracy.\n\nWith regards to the flatness of wood right off a saw cut, it really depends on what tool is doing the cutting. Sometimes, they leave cutting marks and sometimes the inaccuracy of the existing wood is translated through the cut. In these situations, hand planes are often used to finish the rough cuts. The alternate is a combination of a powered jointer to create perfectly flat surfaces, and a powered planer to get the wood to the desired thickness.

PM'ing!
[DSA Think Different](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-think-different-keycap-set/) has icon modifiers. The color palette is close to Granite, and the alphanumeric legends are the same size as the modifier legends.
You're looking for a standard 60% bottom row, stepped capslock, split backspace, split right shift, side LED/underglow. The layout isn't too uncommon but the underglow limits your choices. Off the top of my head, here are two options that would work.\n\n**Option 1**\n\n[Nerd60](http://www.gonskeyboardworks.com/pcbs-and-controllers/113-nerd-60-ver20-pcb.html) + [acrylic case](http://www.gonskeyboardworks.com/housings-and-related-parts/103-acrylic-housing-for-nerd-60.html) + [LEDs](http://www.gonskeyboardworks.com/electric-parts/14-ledssmd-50-pcs.html) (but there's been problems with order fulfillment recently).\n\n**Option 2**\n\n[B.face x2](http://winkeyless.kr/product/b-face-x2-pcb/) + [acrylic case](http://winkeyless.kr/product/bbb_acrylic-case-with-rgb-diffuser/) ([detailed build log](https://medium.com/@alex_young/b-face-x2-build-log-epic-guide-11df33bea46a#.j0dpuyslo))
For people interested in hand-wiring their own keyboard: \n\n1: [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) to build your ideal layout. \n\n2: Copy and paste the raw data into [SwillKB Plate & Case Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/) \n\n3: There's a direct link to push the order to Lasergist. \n\nThe [last custom plate](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/b661f21968659b39a265a06ad5f9058a) I ordered cost me ~$41. I'd say reasonably priced. 
I'm a graphic designer in a marketing group as well and the 60% layout is my daily driver. As long as you are "fluent" in your cmd/alt/shift shortcuts, you won't find adding an additional layer to be a burden at all. It took me only a day to get accustomed to it and now I feel lost without my arrows on capslock + IJKL! The one thing I do want to add is a sidekick 10keypad for those times where I have to do a lot of number entry. Let me know if you have any specific usage questions. 
Lol, I originally ordered the pre-assembled Massdrop KC60 with Gateron Reds, but I got the itch to try putting a kit together myself so I ordered a second one with Gateron Clears from Aliexpress. The second one came in maybe two weeks while the Massdrop one took months. Both versions had warped cases, cheap cables, and cheap caps.\n\nSince I was already collecting tools to solder the KC60, I ended up getting a few more supplies and soldered my own cables. Currently working on making a wooden case. \n\n1: Massdrop KC60/Gateron Reds/no LEDs/Blank PBT Keycaps/DIY wooden case\n\n2: Aliexpress KC60/Gateron Clears/sip sockets/3mm LEDs/ThinkDifferent DSA Keycaps/[Photo](http://imgur.com/8qpBN80)\n\nAs far as layouts go, I have 3 main layers: (1) Colemak, (2) FN1, (3) Macros/Keyboard Features.\n
Awesome. I tried searching but I couldn't figure out the term for "usb passthrough". I'll take a look and give it a shot. Thanks for the help!
Yup, that's a standard layout. If you try the ABS set and decide that it's not really your thing, you can probably get most of your money back by offering it on /r/mechmarket. Good luck!
To add to what /u/CatfishChronic and /u/brandon7s have said, the main drawback to the Vortex Core is that it doesn't allow re-programming on the default layer. For 40% boards where customizability is absolutely necessary, not having access to the default layer is a huge drawback. Swapping the internals to a hand-wired Teensy while using the same key layout has the form-factor/keycaps/aluminum case of the Core AND the full programming capabilities of QMK/TMK.
I feel like my fingers have to reach slightly further to hit the higher rows, but not uncomfortably so. Aside from that, they don't feel all that much different. DSA profile is also Dvorak/Colemak friendly since you can swap your keys across rows. 
I would do a prototype in poplar first as it's cheap and very easy to work. You can find poplar in any Home Depot or Lowes. Once you have the measurements down, you can move to a harder wood. Some suggestions for final species: if you want a lighter color, any variation of hard maple (curly and birds eye have beautiful characteristics), and if you want darker, any variation of walnut. 
O-rings deaden the feel of switches. The shortened travel distance makes the action stop too abruptly for some people. For that reason, I hesitate to suggest them as a way to quiet a board. But the difference in noise between linears vs tactiles is not as different as compared to clicky switches. Any linear or tactile switch should be just fine in an friendly open-office environment. \n\nSubjectively, I started with blues, then added a keyboard with browns to be office-friendly, then handwired a board with clears, then built a second board with reds, then built a third board with 65g Zealios. The only switches I hesitate to bring to work are the blue switches.\n\nWhat about this [Magicforce with Gateron Clears](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mechanical-Keyboard-GATERON-Magicforce-Qisan/dp/B01E6S1HSA) for £49.68?
Yup! Applying a bit of lube where the legs of the wires are clipped in will give the wire rotation a very smooth action. Also, a little on the walls of where the + inserts move up and down against the stabilizer housing will reduce chatter. Try not to get any on the + stems themselves though. I use simple white lithium grease from the hardware store. As little as a grain of rice in each spot should do the trick. To apply, I found a toothpick more useful than a q-tip.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/oWgrnQGBBn4?t=340)'s a good closeup video showing what I mean.\n\nEdit: Forgot about [Ripster's famous Guide to Lube](http://imgur.com/a/lhLqo#zG2aH).
PM'ing
Maybe consider keeping arrows on home row so you don't have to shift your hands. \n\nAlso, I only see one FN but you have two layers. SpaceFn?
The creator of the site has also just rewrote it from the ground up to support QMK at [http://qmk.sized.io/](http://qmk.sized.io/)!
GH60/KC60 is a good choice. It's a standard 60% size, which means it's compatible with most 60% cases when you want to upgrade (and you will), comes with choice of Gateron or Cherry switches, is visually programmable with their web-based interface, and is LED friendly.\n\n[Aliexpress Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Customized-KC60-60-Kit-Plastic-Case-Switches-Plate-Led-Stabilizers-for-60-Standard-ANSI-Mechanical-Keyboard/429151_32629156371.html) - If you're trying to keep costs down, just start with the plastic case. Kit 1 for $90/free shipping isn't bad. You just need to find keycaps. Stabilizers rattle like they have Parkinson's though.\n\nAlso, look into [sip socket mods](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNTOrmBnrYETOe8Fsjzzf3Se68hap6Oztd8BU-s8ZUT2zfxpQoXtvCWxRXUp-VNRw?key=QTlXc3dFc1dhNi1BLWtGdlROMTFDWDRyV2pNWWd3) for hot-swappable LEDs, and upgrading the programmability with open-source and amazing [QMK](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware) firmware.
The easiest way to get individual custom-sized keycaps is to buy DSA blanks from [pimpmykeyboard.com](http://www.pimpmykeyboard.com). DSA profile is un-sculpted so you can use them in any row. They sell 1u caps in packs of 10, spacebars individually, in-between caps in packs of 4, and all of them in various PBT colors. In some cases, it's cheaper to order full DSA sets for alphas/mods and add missing caps separately. Unfortunately, 5.5u spacebar doesn't exist aside from Noppoo Choc Mini or ordering one to be custom printed from [shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/product/274MBNFB5/blank-spacebar-keycap-5-5x?optionId=34454466). It would probably be easier to split the spacebar into two keys and readjust bottom row accordingly. 
This actually might get more discussion over at /r/woodworking, but I do hobby woodworking as my other wallet-draining hobby and I can give my two cents. \n\nWood is generally categorized into two groups: hardwoods and softwoods. As long as you stick with a hardwood that it relatively easy to work, you should be fine. \n\nWalnut (chocolatey brown after finish is applied), hard maple (pleasantly pale with nice a golden hue), and cherry (reddish brown) are all readily available at your local Home Depot or Lowes, and are very tight-grained and nice to work with. Poplar (pale green) is cheaper and very easy to work, but is actually softer than pine so it wouldn't be ideal for the final case, but would work well for prototyping. You can check the hardness of each species against each other on the [Janka Scale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test). \n\nTry to use sections that are knot free and have straight grain to prevent weird warping after milling. A spray-on finish would be easiest, but wipe-on poly worked well for me. You'll want to apply finish in thin layers with light sanding between every few layers. 
I would join as well!
This is one of the few artisan caps that I've actually been really impressed by! Detail and composition is incredible!

Just received the caps, and though they're pretty good quality, it's not really HHKB compatible. Namely, it's missing the two keys I've highlighted in red in this [image](http://imgur.com/bUxFOxX). It does have the 1.75u right shift though. Will probably return the set because I only ordered it for HHKB layout.  : (
Thanks for sharing your code! Someone's used it already.
There are some people that like ABS over PBT. Having both to try out is a good thing! Which model Leopold do you have? Some of them have non-standard layouts.
I have a 3 gallon Walstad tank in my office with a couple of live plants (Anubias and a random grass-type), a filter, and a heater. Started with 5 Cherry Shrimp, but after a few bouts of eggs, am currently around 25-30 with more on the way. The setup is similar enough where I can share my own experiences.\n\n* I prefer minimal-looking rimless square-cornered glass tanks like [this one](http://aquaticvita.com/). Unfortunately, they're still fulfilling Kickstarter pledges and are not being sold to public yet. If you can find something similar (tank only, ignore the add-ons), I'd say go for it. [This 2.7g](http://www.amazon.com/Penn-Plax-Vertex-Shrimp-2-7-Gallon/dp/B0069RPRHO) also looks good, but is slightly too big. They're easier to clean and don't scratch like plastic ones do. Water evaporation is pretty constant, but if you do weekly/bi-weekly water changes, it shouldn't matter. Alternatively, you can find plastic 1g tanks with lids that are made for betta-fish. They'd also be good for shrimp.\n* My filter is hardly ever turned on (5 minutes in the mornings to get some water circulation), so you may be able to get away with no filter as long as you have live plants and do weekly/bi-weekly water changes. \n* A heater is pretty important. I've never been able to keep happy shrimp without one. ~75 degrees ambient room temp would probably mean ~68 degrees in the tank. They'll survive, but will be slightly lethargic and will not breed. \n* Any desktop lamp should be sufficient if you choose easy-maintenance, low-light plants and use the suggested Walstad potting soil. Make sure you sift out large pieces of debris unless you like the natural messiness it gives. Also, I've noticed potting soil makes for a more pungent tank. Carpeting plants will be close to impossible without CO2 of some kind. I've tried to use liquid CO2 in the past, but could not get plants to carpet successfully. Java moss and Marimo balls are good choices for plants. Look into other low-light plants like Anubias. Drift wood provides good grazing for shrimp and works well as focal point for aquascaping, but fresh wood will leach tannins into your tank water and give it an amber/sepia hue.\n\nFrom my experience, you need 3 constants for Cherry Shrimp to be happy: **temperature**, **food**, and **water quality**.\n\n* **Temperature:** My heater is set to 74 degrees. They're silent and only kick in when the temperature falls below a certain threshold. I can't imagine anyone would give you a hard time for having it in your tank.\n* **Food:** Cherry Shrimp like to graze on organic matter that grow on top of surfaces. An established tank should have plenty of this. I've gone weeks without adding food and letting them survive on just grazing. But I've only had shrimp successfully breed by supplementing their grazing with more food. Currently, I add crushed up pellets of Crab Cuisine every other morning. They sink, making it ideal for shrimp.\n* **Water quality:** I do bi-weekly 50% water changes. Remember to use a water conditioner and try to keep the temperature similar. \n\nCrystal Red Shrimp are too delicate to work in a 1 gallon tank and Amano Shrimp get too big. Cherry Shrimp and various snails should be fine as long as you have enough surfaces and organic matter, and let the tank mature for a few weeks first. They'll also readily breed where Crystal Red Shrimp and Amano Shrimp won't.
I only ever hit space with my right thumb. A split spacebar would let me use my left thumb to access another layer, which would be really handy on a ~40%.
Ah. That is exactly what I was afraid of... Well, I'm able to make the .hex and reflash from Win10 already, but liked the idea of doing it all from Ubuntu. Thanks for the response, prototrd.
To add to this, what about implementing SpaceFn as a special third layer modifier? When you tap spacebar, it gives you a space like normal, but when held down, it accesses the LaTeX symbols across the home row?
I distinctly remember being able to choose post-process finishing options, but I'm on my phone and the website isn't playing nicely at the moment. I'll go through a mock order tomorrow and see what I can figure out.
It does have the option for screw holes. Choose Sandwich for Case Type and it'll open up some options. \n\nWhen I ordered mine, I hadn't decided on how to handle it yet. The two styles I've seen vary in screw positioning; having the screw holes on the edges (like the Whitefox), or on the interior (like the Pok3r). But I've also seen people just use epoxy to join the plate and case. 
I tried doing it with tap-dance, but as far as I can tell, you have to input the number of tap sequences first, THEN it takes the action. In my case, I'd like to see the action on each press. Like how T9 input on phones used to work. I'll look into a macro and state variables. Thanks for the input!
ahahaha oops fixed :)
Its good that you know what size you're looking for. The next step would be to narrow it down even further with choice of switch. There's a lot of different switches out there but they basically fall in three or four different camps: clicky, tactile, linear, and 'other'. \n\n* Clicky - You'll feel when the switch actuates and hear audible feedback on each keypress. Very satisfying typing experience, but can be loud and bothersome to both yourself/others.\n* Tactile - You'll feel when the switch actuates on each keypress, but no audible 'click'. Quieter than clickys with some physical feedback.\n* Linear - No physical feedback besides bottoming out, and no real audible feedback besides bottoming out. Tends to feel mushy to people who enjoy clicky/tactile.\n* Other - Buckling springs, topre, odd switch types that are probably not a good idea for a newcomer. \n\nThat's a super simple summary, but should get you started on the right track. 
Bought 2 x Tex cases from /u/HighNoon03.
Confirmed
Actually, taking the Royal Glam into consideration, it wouldn't be too crazy to find suitable standoffs, embed them into the wood yourself, and you're golden. Positional accuracy would be important though.
Yup, /u/aqlno is right. In a gist, the programmability of TMK/QMK let's you create whatever layouts you want. You can set a default mac layer on layer0, a windows layer on layer1, and toggle between the two with whatever keyboard shortcut makes sense to you. The stock software even comes with an example where Qwerty, Dvorak, and Colemak are all on the same keyboard. And Plancks use a special key code that just toggles the location of cmd/win and alt, without having to create separate layers. 
Aw, I just ordered it because the description says includes extra keys to make it HHKB-compatible, which uses a 1.75 right-shift. That's not the case?
Kb.sized.io was instrumental in my first hand-wired build! Thanks for updating it to QMK! Two comments. \n \nFirstly, found a small bug when I imported my [next keyboard layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@@_c=%23ee8833&a:7%3B&=ESC&_c=%23e8e8e8%3B&=Q&=W&=E&=R&=T&=Y&=U&=I&=O&=P&_c=%23b3b3b3&w:1.75%3B&=DEL%3B&@_w:1.25%3B&=FN1&_c=%23e8e8e8%3B&=A&=S&=D&=F&=G&=H&=J&=K&=L&=%2F%3B&_c=%23b3b3b3&w:1.5%3B&=FN2%3B&@_w:1.75%3B&=SHIFT&_c=%23e8e8e8%3B&=Z&=X&=C&=V&=B&=N&=M&=%3C&=%3E&_c=%23ee8833%3B&=%2F&%23x2191%2F%3B&_c=%23b3b3b3%3B&=FN3%3B&@_w:1.25%3B&=CTRL&_w:1.25%3B&=OPT&_w:1.25%3B&=CMD&_w:1.25%3B&=%3Ci%20class%2F='fa%20fa-caret-down'%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&_w:1.75%3B&=ENTER&_w:1.75%3B&=&_w:1.25%3B&=%3Ci%20class%2F='fa%20fa-caret-up'%3E%3C%2F%2Fi%3E&_c=%23ee8833%3B&=%2F&%23x2190%2F%3B&=%2F&%23x2193%2F%3B&=%2F&%23x2192%2F). It incorrectly detects 13 rows instead of 12, and stacks the column numbering for 11 and 12 on top of each other. The same layout calculated and rendered properly in kb.sized.io. \n \nSecondly, kb.sized.io displayed the pins next to the columms/rows, which I found helpful in keeping track of what I was doing. Any particular reason for hiding it in the new version?
Totally understand. Looking forward to all the new boards!
If you're looking to build your own board, the [Aliexpress Plastic GH60 Kit](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Customized-KC60-60-Kit-Plastic-Case-Switches-Plate-Led-Stabilizers-for-60-Standard-ANSI-Mechanical-Keyboard/32629156371.html) would be a good start because you can choose your board components and it'll be QMK/TMK compatible.\n\nAssuming you have basic soldering equipment (a soldering iron, solder, solder sucker at a minimum), and the full $100 can be used, there are two different kit configurations that I would recommend.\n\n**Kit 1 - $92 + free shipping -** \n\n* Plastic case (white, black, purple, opaque white, clear)\n* 60% PCB that supports QMK/TMK and LEDs.\n* Steel plate (steel) for costar stabilizers, OR aluminum plate (silver, black, red, purple, blue) for cherry stabilizers\n* Gateron switches (blue, brown, black, red, white, yellow, green)\n* LEDs (3mm in various colors, 2x3x4 in various colors)\n\n**Kit 2 - $105 + free shipping -** \n\n* Same as Kit 1 but Cherry MX switches (blue, brown, black, red) for an additional $13\n\nCouple more notes:\n\n* The kits don't come with keycaps, which is a good thing because bundled keycaps are almost always poor quality. \n* The plastic case is pretty thin and cheap. Since its a standard 60% size, you'll be able to upgrade to a nicer aluminum case later on. \n* The included stabilizers are very rattly. I use a tiny bit of lithium grease on the pivot points to make them smoother and quieter.\n\nGood luck! \n\n*Edit: /u/Inhumanskills's suggestion for the [aluminum GH60 kit](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Customized-KC60-Full-Set-Aluminum-Case-Programmable-PCB-Steel-Plate-Switches-LED-For-60-Standard-Layout/32620290856.html) is good too, if you can pay the extra $37. It's the same kit, but you get an aluminum case rather than cheap plastic.
I have the [Incase Sling Pack](https://www.goincase.com/shop/camera-bags/incase-dslr-sling-pack/) and I really like it. A bit pricey at $89.95, but fits my GX1, 14-45mm, 45-150mm, 20mm pancake, cheap macro adapter, lens cleaning pens, air puffer, spare battery, tablet, mini tripod, and 60" tripod in the bottom straps with room to spare. Well made with plenty of pockets, but I haven't tested it's weather resistance yet.
Wow! I had not seen this project on his site before. Only the Gherkin. Thanks for the link!
While you have everything disassembled, consider getting some lube for the stabilizers. I wouldn't go so far as to oil the switches, but the tiniest bit of lube on the stabilizers' friction points will help with any chatter and smoothness. Once you start soldering the switches in, it'll trap the stabilizers between the pcb and the plate, and it'll be a lot of work to regain access.
Right? Don't make my mistake though. Figure out how you're going to attach the plate to the case before ordering. I'm going to have to drill screw holes.  -__-\n\nAlso, if your layout has a lot of uncommon sized keys, it may be more expensive than you think to assemble the keycap set. DSA is the most forgiving because row profiles don't matter, but not everyone enjoys the flatness. [PMK](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/blank-key-packs/) sells 1u keys in packs of 10 and larger widths in packs of 4.
Remember that heat from the iron will dictate where the solder flows. For a good connection, heat up both the lead and the pad together, then feed the solder until you get a nice [concave cone](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NhKtbumNnGQ/UJ0CEtYvbxI/AAAAAAAAAIw/rcStl_ZcplM/s1600/index.2.gif). One thing that will make a huge difference is to work with an appropriate sized soldering iron tip. \n\nNot too difficult to get passable joints! Just need patience to get through the first few ugly ones.
Brother in arms!\n\n[DAS/WhitePBT](http://i.imgur.com/YeTXO5K.jpg)
Sure thing. I got my own KC60 weeks ago and I'm STILL tweaking and playing with it. 
Like /u/ckekc said, the long lead is positive and should match the positive terminal on the pcb. They're usually marked on the bottom of the PCB with a + or square shaped pad: [GH60 Example](http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1l3DWKpXXXXalXFXXq6xXFXXXG/Satan-GH60-PCB-White-Board-Flashed-Firmware-DIY-Mechanical-Keyboard-Poker-2-Pure-HHKB-with-Diode.jpg).\n\nLED sizes are important because they can get in the way of keycap fit and travel. The most common ones are 1.5mm, 3mm, and 2x3x4 square LEDs. \n\nWhile we're talking about LEDs, also look up sip sockets. Two of them can be added to each switch in place of the LED and soldered to the PCB. They act as receptacles for the LED pins, allowing easy swapping of LEDs: [damorgue's guide on GeekHack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51792.0).
My copy of Zelda arrived while I was at work today, but I went to the game anyways.
FWIW, I loved clears and have been really enjoying 78g zealios. They are definitely lighter but also smoother, and I like the bump better.
Anyone have a YouTube stream? \n\nEdit: also, why is tsn so bad at streaming?
True but he hasn't played goalie in a long time.
But do they circle player killed deer or the deer corpses that just spawn like that?
Older DSA dyesub sets used a different font but the newly produced ones moved to the font that Granite uses. If you're buying new they should be the same, but if you pick up an older dyesub set on mechmarket or something they may be the old font.
You can buy some keyboards "barebones" with are complete keyboards but without keycaps. So that would include a case already, but you could then replace it.\n\nTo get something without a case you're looking at a DIY build. This is where you buy a PCB (or handwire it), a plate if you want, the switches, stabilizers, case, and any other components your build may need and then assemble and solder it up yourself. There are quite a few options for DIY boards out there, so you'd have to narrow down what you want to build.
If it does data as well then it should be fine. Just beware of the annoying "charging only" usb cables.
Forced to have memories... fiendish.
Also just bought a Hakko 888D and was using 750 F to do my first build, went just fine.
I think this is a very personal thing. I type as fast or faster on mechs in general, but I typically am not using blue switches.
Even while playing a wizard 12 / archmage 2, I was capable of some ridiculous stuff and could answer any challenge just about. mythic ranks go a long way for knowledgeable players and some of the options are quite abusable.
I'd suggest living with the default keys at first and see how you like them, take advantage of having the pok3r legends to learn the board layout. \n\nI am a sucker for PBT though, I really like the feel. ABS keys will start to wear and shine eventually but you'll get some use out of them before that gets too bad.\n\nThose caps are a very good price for a full PBT set. Could be worth trying just to see how they are.
Cool, thanks!\n\nThere definitely are lots of decoration options in roll20 assets, so even if I was able to make a map and then dress it up further in roll20, that might help a lot.\n\nAbout to run Hell's Rebels, and I've been spoiled by running ROTRL. The community has made such gorgeous maps for the AP over the years, all just ready to play.
Plus they are used to taking tons of breaks for every little thing anyways.
Yes. It makes no sense to me that we have two challengable situations but then something like a completely missed penalty that results in a goal can't be challenged. It seems arbitrary what can and can't be challenged. I'd like to see them get rid of challenges for offsides altogether, or perhaps only if the goal is within X seconds of entering the zone (i.e. the offsides led immediately to a goal).
poker with clears at work. custom with zeals at home. Custom is actually quieter because this poker pings a bit.\n\nI asked some nearby coworkers and no one minds. It's louder than most folks but still quieter than the guy that hammers the crap out of his rubber dome. \n\nI wouldn't use clicky switches at the office.
Yeah, but fn+number gets you them. I guess if you play at higher levels, the dedicated key becomes more important. The games I play, it doesn't really matter. (FPS, rocket league, many single player games)
For yellow and black, find a set called tai hao bumble bee.
You can get thick pbt blanks for ~$60 or so, or can get tai hao abs sets for <$40.
Those are fine for low end boards, I'd wait for a sale though, they've been going for $40 ish fairly regularly over the past few months.
I thought it was questionable how quickly Wheels was back, I guess the spotters didn't think he needed protocol?
So, GM just didn't understand magic at all. I've seen that mistake a fair bit, thinking you get access to the higher level spell slots because of your high stat. I think it's explained fairly awkwardly and is easily misunderstood.

*shrug* my work has flexible hours, I could do 7-3 if I wanted to.
It is! It replaced my g500 and I'm really enjoying it.
Have you tried different usb ports or even a different pc? Just wondering if it's some odd combo like the cable not liking your front usb ports or something like that.
There used to be racks of shareware disks at stores, or even a console where you could insert a disk and have demos copied to it.\n\nI am pretty sure I got a pirated copy of Doom. Via a BBS. Later, I bought Doom 2 on CD-ROM. 
Ahh got it now. Didn't see that until I went digging for it. Thanks!
There are plastic cases for like $15 on aliexpress, could be a good option if you don't find anything second hand.
Eh, it's like pizza, it's not hard to get to "decent", as long as you're able to consume it immediately and/or be drunk.
I would agree that replacing the pok3r case with a cheap clear one is a bit silly since you're paying for aluminum, I'm not sure you'd get much light shining through the case because of the way the pok3r rgb is built. You could always sell the stock case on mechmarket though.
Ahh, you need a low profile card, that limits things.\n\nDoes the machine have a card in it already or does it use onboard? If it uses onboard, you could add a low profile card to the slot and use both.\n\nOtherwise, you may need to go external, I can't seem to find a card that supports 3 displays AND is low profile.
I find out about most movies via podcasts. Either the people involved being guests, or just podcast people talking about movies they're looking forward to.
Received the case today and am impressed by it. Got it fairly quickly too.
They do around human corpses, but not game kills.
Already a good suggestion on O-rings, just check their specs for size and hardness. Dental bands also do in a pinch, and are dirt cheap.\n\nI can't say whether the Zealencio's are worth it as I haven't bought any. I've used his switches, stabilizers and PCB in a build though and they are all high quality products. (note that his switches in themselves aren't any quieter, you need his silencers)\n\nPbt often sounds a bit deeper (close to a "thock" than a "clack"), not any quieter really... though again this varies on the exact caps you're comparing.
While there definitely is a storage implication to a larger limit, or unlimited storage, it's not much.\n\nAll you really have to store is a row that basically says "CMDR X is storing Y module with Z modifications at station N". Row counts in the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands aren't a huge deal with large scale enterprise databases. Scaling up for an increase should not be difficult. \n\nI'd agree that unlimited is a bad idea, but the limit could definitely be higher without much impact.
I added an SSD to a system that they built and it was a very neat and tidy build job. Excellent cable management, lots of zip ties for neatness, my friend has had no issues with the computer.
Least favorite of the originals perhaps, but I still really enjoy the pacing of the three simultaneous climactic sequences - land battle, space battle, and jedi showdown.
You talking U2... to me?
Do you really need dedicated function keys for gaming? I've had no issues going without though it may depend on what games you play. On most of these small boards, FN+1 = F1, and so on, so you still have access to the function commands.
I dont like the side cutout details in the lambo, but otherwise very nice case. Much prefer this one, just hope it's as nice as it looks once I get it. It shipped 10 days ago, with any luck it'll get here soon...
Sometimes portability. My favorite thing is that I can do anything a regular board can do (other than numpad codes) without moving my hands from home position. I find it quite helpful to be able to navigate around a large text file without having to reposition or grab the mouse.
I don't think he's heard it before.
They also had electronic darts and a pool game where you had to sink pairs of purple and orange balls. 
Does this still have the crappy DRM?
GMK sets often are. There are way cheaper sets to be had.
So they finally jazzed it up a bit.
Me llamo T-Bone La araña discoteca.
Yup, it's fairly comparable. Their larger cities are very close to Winnipeg climate wise.
If you ever have to fend off a home invasion, your Filco will double as a pretty capable bludgeon. Things are solid.
Even cheaper for pc during a sale, if you really want to get it for the cheapest.
In Canada, we have poutine at Costco. Legitimately decent poutine.
We have no official policy against any self devices, even usb drives. As a developer, I also have local admin to my machine and even global admin to certain other groups of machines. We do have a very locked down network though, maybe they're counting on that. I'm just a coder, not the infrastructure guy.

They just went back up on massdrop.com!
saudi prince?
Little's beard is getting red as it fills in. 
group buy is also still open straight from Zeal, closes tonight.
Making small amounts is easy. Some of the prices are crazy high.
I would say your mainstream (for this sub) choices are gateron and cherry. Gaterons are generally considered to be the best of the cherry mx clones, and a lot of folks like them even more than cherry switches. \n\nThey have all the same compatibility so they'll work with the same pcbs, plates, caps, etc. Gaterons are a fair bit cheaper than cherry, so I'd probably go with those myself.\n\nAt the high end of the market, while staying mx compatible, are Zealios. They are produced by gateron but are a higher quality switch and come in clear housings which is great for lightning up the board. They are considerably pricier though.\n\nAs for stabs, you have to decide costar vs cherry style, and if cherry you can either get plate mounted or pcb mounted. Costar are the ones where the wire is on top and it attachs to little inserts, while with cherry the wire is mostly hidden and they attach by mx stems. I prefer cherry style myself, but that's subjective. Again, zeal offers a premium option of transparent stabs that are quite nice, but also a lot pricier.
some nitpicky notes:\n\n- Anyone can do 1 extra offhand attack, TWF feat just reduces the penalties to something reasonable.\n\n- You only take TWF penalties when actually making the extra off hand attack. Someone who dual wields but doesn't take any extra attacks beyond what their BAB allows does not take TWF penalties.
Thanks for the update! I just installed this rubber padding and I actually quite like it: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQTV2I/\n\n\nIt comes in a huge 24 x 36" sheet so it's plenty enough for a bunch of keyboards. It has a rubbery smell (which makes sense because, duh, it's made of rubber), but after airing it out it will be just fine. It seems to give my keyboard a nice THOCK and I think the thickness of it is perfect. I'm still not done with my build but when I  am I will post pictures and a build guide.
O-rings will make the bottom out feel mushy. There are different hardness and size of O-rings that will change up exactly how this feels. This will only dampen the sound of bottoming out though, but it does help. Otherwise there are silencers available such as Zeal's that dampen the upstroke too, though its a much pricier option.\n\nYour filco came with ABS caps. PBT feels different, sounds different and won't "shine" with use like ABS will.\n\nI don't have one but many here like the Anne Pro. Good option for the low end of 60% boards.
Any clue how this compares to buying market assets on roll20 and piecing together maps from those? How suitable is the content for making a bunch of urban maps?
It's working well for my grip, mice are really subjective. The PBT is amazing though, it helps with my hand sweat a fair bit.
*softly weeps*
Not every time though, I've never had to provide ID, I've made 4 purchases.\n\nIt was quite simple... make order, order ships, receive product.
Don't stick your fingers at him, hold out the back of your hand. Let's them get a good sniff and lick without you extending vulnerable digits.
I did my first build on the weekend and it was actually quite fun, but I imagine that takes a certain type of personality to enjoy. As others are saying, you'll basically have to commission one.\n\nHeck, I'd build something for free but most people aren't going to want to pay for shipping both ways.
I'm imagining the young adventurer slays a goblin and suddenly the skies open up and start raining down gold coins on him.
This has R3 78g zealios and I'm really enjoying them. I've mostly used cherry clears and browns before this. These feel smooth with a nice bump.
Yup, this is true. Make that one bit easier at the least.
Zealpc.net is in canada, but only useful if you're looking for his particular switches.
I ordered from that listing a couple of weeks ago and received a shipping notification. Hopefully it arrives without too much delay. \n\nComparable cases are Tex and Lambo, but both are a fair bit pricier. I like the simple lines on this as compared to the Lambo as well.
Assuming you are from North America, you would be buying an ANSI poker that has a "standard" layout and most keysets come in standard ANSI, so you should be fine.\n\nIf you're in Europe and are getting an ISO poker, then you'll need a set that accommodates ISO, not to mention whatever regional layout for the legends.\n\nAlso, they need to be MX style stems, which the vast majority are. (as opposed to Topre stems or Alps or other...) 
Excellent, thank you.
I like your cooler master much better. Good choice.
re: process... I did my first ever build in an afternoon. The only soldering I had to do was switches though.\n\nre: aluminum cases... check out aliexpress for some decently priced options, there are both low and high profile black aluminum cases available there, I used a high profile one for my build.
Does it seem like these skates fuck up too often?

I enjoy Dave's scorpion, don't know if it's the hottest non-extract though.
Good good, thanks. That looked pretty rough.
I believe it's essentially the same, just plus garlic. Same bottle but different color label and maybe lid.
Thanks! I originally wanted to put this in a high profile case as well. I was initially looking at the lambo case since my other boards (both whitefoxes) are low profile, but once I took a look at the zealios switches sitting on the board and knowing that they are going to be RGB I wanted to feature them more.
whoa inverted alts too, makes sense... i might try this with blanks.
That's pretty damn gorgeous!
Oooh I like this one.
Yeah it's a pretty neat layout. I think you'll be super happy. I don't believe in endgames, just current daily drivers, but this is pretty damn satisfying. I was going to do 7u spacebar and winkeyless on the bottom but I didn't want to kick myself later for losing an extra key. I use that as a FN3 toggle for my numpad layer.
Looks awesome! Very similar to my build, except I put a purple midplate, which I now regret because I think I crushed down the LSHIFT with my ham hands and it broke the clear zeal stabs, so now I have to unsolder the whole damn thing to replace it. I just might not put the plate back on when I fix it. It makes repairs so much easier!
hahaha I guess I can't look past the keyboard :) 
she's the best! first dog i've ever had and i feel so lucky to have her in my life :) dogs are the best!

OMG I want one! Great job!
One thing I would suggest is to keep that in mind when you go keycap shopping. It was actually pretty hard to find a full 117 key keycap set that had everything I needed. There were plenty of 108 sets, 114 sets, but of course I had to be difficult, haha. Thankfully aliexpress has some good ones.
Ah man, you describe exactly what happened with me. Weeks later, we'd of course return to Street Fighter II because it was a bit deeper as far as strategy, combinations and competition, but I will never forget that moment of seeing the first fatalities, and the oohs and ahhs from the crowd. Good times. I miss the arcades.
OK, this is PERFECT... loving reading about some of these functions already and I hope I can get them to work. Thanks so much!
Totally. I don't know if I can trust myself to let a peelable layer be left unpeeled :)
Thanks! Interesting... I ended up getting this rubber anti-vibration pad and I think it works quite well. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQTV2I/

It's going to have a stepped caps and split backspace (because a keyboard is useless for adobe programs without the tilde key) and a split right shift (for yet another function button) and here's the layout I'm putting together:\n\nhttp://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0628448afc17f0a2a3c94d80deb048e6\n\nThe big change is that I moved Caps Lock as a layer 1 key and use that button as a function key. I wanted a layout where my fingers left home row as little as possible, so arrow cluster is on JIKL and my page keys are on SEDF (WASD would require shifting away form home row so it's no good). \n\nI also put a numpad on a layer, as well as putting numpad zero at keypad zero with a modifier, because it's also a huge adobe shortcut key.\n\nLastly, there are media controls and also screen brightness controls for when I use it on my Macbook Air and iPad Pro (via lightning to USB OTG adapter).\n\nGoing to work on more complex macros next :)
yeah the pcb does not line up with all the posts on the case. not sure if it's an issue with the case or with the pcb. also not sure what i'm going to do about it. i'm hdmeeitwbt to order another case because it might also not line up. wish there was a compatibility chart of some sort. 
 Thanks! Going to look it up
The tough part for me on your numpad layout is the placement of the zero because of all the years of learning to be a 10-key touch typist. I think I'm going to do something similar, but shift the zero to where you have your menu key, and move the multiply and divide to be next to the plus and minus, then have the = be on the bottom right button, where it usually is on a numpad.
Both are pretty popular, hard to say. Are you looking for a long drawn out bump, or a shorter tactile bump that's a bit more crisp? 
One more question, sorry... coming from a whitefox where I could assign keys to Lock or Latch into function layers, is that something that I can do with a .bat file or do I have to delve into keymap.c for that? Also, are KC_FN# buttons modifiers to go to that layer? Is there a layer lock function that works like a caps lock but for layers?\n\nEDIT: basically I want to be able to do what triple-tapping FN_TT13 or TT23 does (toggle layer 3 on/off) but assign it to a single keypress
they are! since we adopted her from the high kill shelter we could not stop taking photos / videos of her, haha. one of her videos got over 80,000 views on youtube and got her featured on huffington post and other places. so weird. everyone should have a dog in their life, something about them makes you want to be a better person.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPMl8AKKrNY
Is there an example file for definitions? The one linked on the wiki goes to a 404 error. I would define it in the config.h file yes? I guess that means I would no longer be using a bat file but going the make route if I wanted to get this done? 
I heard that you may need to shave a little part of the pcb to get it to fit in that case, near where the USB port is. Please report back and let me know how it went (with pictures, of course!).
specs: Zeal60 PCB, 65g zealios switches (i will never go back!), zeal transparent cherry mx style gold plated stabilizers, sentraq purple midplate, low profile black aluminum case, mechcables cable, george made wrist rest.
i got these black blank pbt cherry profile caps from ali express. they had everything i needed for my 60% build with split right shift, split delete. there are 1u bottom row keys on the right side of the tada68 as well as the split right shift which means the ordinary 60% keycap set will not do. \n\nhttps://m.aliexpress.com/s/item/32750162619.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail&productId=32750162619&productSubject=NPKC-Blank-121-Keys-Cherry-Profile-PBT-Keycap-ANSI-ISO-layout-For-Cherry-MX-Switches-Mechanical
Thanks so much! Yeah I think the sentraq plate peeking through from underneath the keys works really well :)
sounds fun! i might try to make it out to this one. it's not too far of a drive from redondo. the difficulty is in convincing my girl to come along. is the event dog friendly? i have a 9 lb doge that would love to make it out.
I have a sega boot disc from when I used to work there. But I don't really bootleg any games. Thankfully I have a huge lot of them still :)
7/21/2016 - "I won't be a servile puppy dog"\n\n1/31/2017 - "Arf! Arf! Woof!"
Looks great! I'm hoping to get a planck on the next round :) Your keycaps make me want to try a space invader keycap layout :)
Thanks so much! I've been wanting to get a 60% but I wanted to have a few specific features: split right shift, split backspace and for some reason I really like the look of a stepped capslock. I also wanted something that looked super clean. I'm pretty happy with this one! I'll post a real build log with more pictures when I have some time. :)
that's pretty! 
Oh snap. Hook a brother up with a message once the raffle is up?
I have 65g zealios r4.5 switches that I'm putting into a 60% board build (zeal60 pcb), this is coming from a gateron brown user. I just test-fitted these since most of the parts are now in and wow man I have to say I LOVE the tactile feel of zealios switches. \n\nBelieve the hype.
Ahhhh thanks! I'm going to have to read through that again!
Copy that. I'll try to get on it soon.
That's awesome! Yes, would love to take a look at the guide when it's done as well. I'll be sure to check this out :)
Thanks man! I got the mouse to match my white Yamaha HS7 speakers and my white tower case, but then the whitefox came and put everything together quite nicely :)
Nice! You even have my all time favorite keyboard (Apple adjustable). However, since I live in California, the first thing I thought of when seeing all those boards on that short shelf was "Those things will kill me in an earthquake." :)
Ah man, good thing I got a big roll of this stuff... I can put it on the zeal60 I'm building, the prima whitefox and the nickel minivan I have pre-ordered :)
Nice! My layout is here for reference if you're interested:\nhttp://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0628448afc17f0a2a3c94d80deb048e6\n\nI'll be putting it up with a full build log when I can find some time.
yessir. portrait mode is pretty neat when it works. great work on it! i wish i picked up more!
hey there, looking to possibly sell my batch 2 whitefox, gateron browns. i also have a george made custom birch wrist rest that fits it perfectly. curious what the price would be.
I have an extra sentraq purple plate (ANSI). I did not do enough research and realized only after the fact that if I wanted the split delete, split right shift and stepped capslock that I had to use the ISO plate. I love how the color just peeks out between the caps.
yeah, it's the 100-400L. really good piece of glass.
Okay, this... I want this. Is there a way to sign up or preorder or whatever I need to do to ensure that I get the opportunity to throw money at you for one? :)
Thanks so much! Will dive into this and try my best to figure it out :)
Funny thing is the photos are from my iPhone 7. I have not seen the photos she took haha. Yes, the ss x key is freaking amazing, btw. I think I can hurt someone with it if I threw it really hard. :)
That is pretty damn sexy!
you misspelled "weaboo" :)\n\ni keed. i keed. :)
Aaaaannnd they're gone. =T I missed out on getting monolegends for my poor set. That's what I get for missing one day of browsing MK!!!!!
Aha! I see it! Thanks!
sweet, i'm in. thanks!
Dear Donald: When the American people finally impeach you, the headlines from all media will read, "You're Fired."
Your whitefox did not come with one? I have a prima and an r2. I haven't opened up the prima but the r2 came with a nce rubber-like liner. EDIT: Both were bought second-hand.
How can you tell how he has his jeans cuffed???? :) 
Ahhh yeah please do update!
Ah that's great to see pictures of this! I almost bought one for my zeal60 build but I ended up getting a low profile floating key one from 1upkeyboards to show off the zeal60rgbs and the clear zealios. I would love to see how it looks on a board, especially if someone got it in black :)
ahhh damn... well, she did ask me to make her a board one of these days, and pink is her favorite color :)
boy this brings back memories! i used to work at sega, and i did the graphics on the vmu football game and worked on sonic team usa on the sonic online stuff :) good times!
Looking at it now, thank you! So does that mean FN_TG33 toggles layer 3? And that I can access even more layers (provided I assign them in the .bat file) using FN_MO43 and so on? Sorry for the annoying questions, my PCB is at home and I'm at work trying to wrap my head around this :)
trial and error. there was always the few kids that would figure it out. there were others that would have notepads and pens and we would all get together for burritos afterward and compare notes. it was super fun. way before the days of googling answers. :)
hehehe thanks!
Oh man, so much this! We used to play in street fighter 2 tournaments back when I was in high school. I am in my early 40s but I still remember that one tournament where I got to the final match by winning with a throw reversal. Huge crowds of people, really fun stuff. Me and my friends had a local arcade we always played at, but we would all occasionally visit other arcades and get in crazy competition. It really was an amazing time.
Hell yeah! That was the best part of it: the suspense of whether or not they would be able to execute the fatality. Kids would stop what games they were playing, crowds would form, there was a lot of excitement in the air. It was a really historic time for gaming.
I would buy the eff out of this, especially if it were available as case only version to use with PCB of my choosing. Great work man! Looks like an awesome bento box!
DSA granite alphas, DSA hc granite bonus pack, DSA hc granite extreme icon modifiers.
If it's the same case as mine I can confirm that it fits. One thing I'm not 100% sure of is if the screws fit perfectly on the standoffs, but they seem to. I dry-fit everything and it seems fine. That said, i LOVE the look of your case, and I'm curious to see how it all turns out for you. It's going to be gorgeous!
I was able to figure it out and now I can say I'm able to at least get what I want out of it. There are neat little features, like I like to use my caps lock as a FN1 button and I have it programmed where if I press it it will act just like a normal caps lock, but if I hold it down it acts as a FN1 modifier. Really neat feature. I can help if you have any questions since I went through all that pain already, haha.
TIL 67gs are the quintessential Zealios. 
Hey there, I have a question: I can't seem to find what FN_MO13 and FN_MO23 means. I am pretty sure they are function layer modifier keys, but I am trying to understand why they are used instead of KC_FN0, KC_FN1, etc. I'm trying to get an understanding of what is going on more than just getting things to work. I can't seem to find any explanation for this. Please advise.
Yeah, I'm a vfx artist who has not been in bash in AGES so I'm used to spreadsheets and I'm whining :) \n\nIf these are most of them, is there a list of all of them? Also, is there a tutorial for programming in complex macros and key sequences? I really want to make the most out of the zeal60 keyboard I'm building and adding more functionality to my whitefoxes.
I was expecting something like this ASCII table: http://www.asciitable.com/\n\nI might put something together and put it on my website just for my own reference.
Adorable! Great work!
Thanks! It sounds time consuming but it might be interesting!
hoo boy that's pretty damn sexy. I was not a part of this sub when this gb was going on so hopefully I can get in on the next one. :)
this board is the freaking best. if you're on the fence, do it.
Oh man you're going to love it. I love the layout options and I didn't get it for the RGB but it's really nice and I can't believe how bright it gets!
this servile puppy dog will yip on command.
I actually asked this question which is why I went with a different case. :) Here's the link to that comment and the answer from zeal: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5o026q/limited_amount_of_r1_zeal60s_extras_available_now/dcfl5js/
I went with one from 1upkeyboards.com... I just noticed that they don't have any more of them in matte black, but I think it looks just like this: https://1upkeyboards.com/al60case-champagne.html
hahaha, yeah I don't think pudding would be a good idea :)
That sucks! But somehow it makes me feel better. But not. :(
Ah, whitefox problems. =T
OH HAPPY DAY! Ordered! Thanks for letting me know!
Yeah as soon as I read about the tap dance function I got excited. :)
That's awesome! As a chihuahua owner, these are perfect!
Begun, the clone war has.
I never knew that this was all I ever wanted. It doesn't even fit in with any of my boards so I will have to make one just for it. Holy crap that's gorgeous.
love it! this is almost exactly how i have my zeal60 set up, except that i have a split backspace because i need the ~ key. other than that: stepped caps, split right shift. great looking board! i even have a pink and white of my own, but it's a bluetooth keyboard. :)
i don't remember exactly. it's a long lens monster that she actually couldn't use to shoot my keyboard because it was meant for shooting animal pictures (she's headed to galapagos in a month).
I picked it up from 1upkeyboards.com\n\nI believe it's this guy: https://1upkeyboards.com/al60case-black.html\n\nNote that it was supposed to fit the zeal60 pcb perfectly, but it does not. It may be an issue with the pcb, it may be an issue with the case, but that's what we deal with when we work with customs, i guess. One of these days when I have time I'm going to try to figure out how to seat it better.
The clips are actually under 0.9mm thick, but they dampen the upstroke and bottom out noise quite a bit when paired with Cherry profile keycaps. Reduction in travel is quote minimal compared to other offerings such as orings, landing pads, etc. 
If you have a PayPal account, you could fund via bank account... Other than that CC based services are pretty standard in the industry. 
Sliders+top housing. 
All plates work with the hot swap sockets. Just make sure to push the sockets firmly into the PCB and you're set! 
Nice! Not many people opt for PCB mounted build. :)
Maybe :o
I'm more surprised you kept the stock Aristotle housings, considering how crappy they are. :/
Most people buying the Zeal60 PCB aren't going to be using cheapish doubleshot shine-through caps. Once you start getting more into the hobby, you start to appreciate the glow around thick keycaps and don't care for the "gamer/awkwawrd" looking legends found on shine through caps. You'll either sport thick ABS DS caps such as GMK, or Cherry profile dyesub PBT, SA, DSA etc. \n\nAs for the legend brightness, since the LEDs are on the user side instead of North facing, the legends won't shine as brightly. You can try for yourself, but it won't be optimal. \n\nZealencios are frosted, so it helps diffuse light a bit. The top part is a solid white square though, so again, keycaps that have top aligned legends won't glow as bright. 
You'll have to open it up and look for yourself to get a feel of how the parts are put together. Angle the internal slider and gently pull it out like this: http://i.imgur.com/q15f3Ue.jpg\n\nThe back part of the slider should pop out if done properly. 
Hmm...there hasn't been a video guide made yet, but will consider making one. \n\nYou can download the firmware here and edit the bat tool to check it out though! https://zealpc.net/blogs/news/programming-your-zeal60-rgb-pcb\n\nHere's a video sethbc made of the Zeal60 running reactive mode in an early V0.1 of the firmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J0lGfyet7s\n\nSince then, we've added a bunch of new features as you can find in the changelog at the bottom of the blog. \n
The old R2/R3 78g spring was underweight, around 68-69g. It has since been addressed on R4 onwards. \n\nStem wobble has been addressed, made stem a bit fatter to reduce wobble greatly. 
1) 78g Zealios. Basically softer, smoother MX Clears without the super tight grip on caps. FYI MX Clears bottom out at 95-100g. \n\n2) R4 Zealios onward have greatly reduced the wobble. 67g has a slightly more pronounced tactile bump than the rest of the weights, but that's just because of a certain sweet spot in the spring weight. 65g has a more bubbly/rounder bump, whereas 78g is a mix of 65g+67g in tactility feel. \n\n3) Set your keymap/LEDs once in the .bat file and everything else can be set via FN + button. You can control brightness, hue, saturation, tweak alphas/mods only, cycle preset hues, reactive mode, wave (horizontal+vertical) mode/raindrop "random colours", etc. \n\nTo set individual keys to certain hue colours, you'll have to set it in the .bat. Accessing that mode can be done via FN+button. 
There's going to be a 65% next, then perhaps 75% and TKL in the future. 
That's interesting to hear. On both my Zealencio'd builds, the clips clicked on easily with the spudger tool. Tried on both aluminum and stainless plates. You can definitely install them onto the switch and then assemble if it's easier for you though. :)
65g is most popular due to MD only offering it...But community wise, 67g and 78g are pretty close back to back. 
Yes, everything will be shipped in one package. If you'd like a slightly softer and much smoother MX Clear, then I'd definitely recommend 78gs.
PM'd. 
Had extras, so figured why not. ;)
Oops. Thanks for catching that. 
Yes. 
Not a single 67g or 78g switch remains. :o But if you place your order now, earliest you'll see the switches would be around March! 
Not really. I guess you can subscribe to my newsletter and one will be sent out whenever the PCB is ready to launch. 
Yep. ;)
Dude, that's crazy. I've always wondered what cool projects people would do with my 4pin RGB LEDs...Never imagined someone would hand wire a whole board! Major kudos to you. 
1) You shouldn't have any duds, switches are QC'd during assembly. \n
Coming very soon. 
It'll dampen the upstroke and bottom out if you use Cherry profile keycaps. Click will still remain. 
The switches are supported by the pcb mount pins and the switches are soldered. There's no reason for pcb mounted builds to wobble. At most the pcb flexes a bit more. 
Krytox is extremely inert and almost has no solvents that can remove it. You will have to disassemble each Aristotle stem and give it a good wipe with a cloth (preferably microfiber). Then once you feel it's mostly off, give it another good wipe with another clean, unused microfiber cloth. Water won't really do anything and will just bead up around Krytox lube. 
Would be up to them. 
Yes, definitely. If you'd prefer to compile your own hex, you can take a look at wilba's github here: https://github.com/Wilba6582/qmk_firmware/tree/zeal60
I'm sure there are a bunch of guides on r/mk and google, just make sure not to skimp out on a quality soldering station. Skip the cheap $10-20 soldering irons, your life will be miserable trying to work with those. Practice on some small PCBs you can pick up on ebay. 
67g has a satisfying "crisper" tactile bump than 65g, feels slightly higher/shorter duration with a tad bit more cushion. Though 65g is also very nice with its bubbly tactile bump. 78g if you want a fusion of the two but a heavier bottom out while still being lighter than MX Clears. \n\nUnfortunately I'm currently out of 67g and 78g Zealios (might have 1x 78g remaining)...Not sure if you wanted a 3pcs switch tester missing 67g though. 
Yes. 
My old stock of SIPs weren't gold plated. :o They were just regular nickel plated. The new gold batch I got in December. 
If I do, it would only be offered in one weight though. Thinking 65/67g. Popularity really isn't there as it barely sold in R1. But now that people seem to appreciate smoothness, I may consider bringing it back. 
Only the springs are different. 
The Zealencio clips are custom designed by us and thus the moulds were 100% purchased for our exclusive use only. There will not be a Gateron variant available. 
Pre-order pricing is still available, just 10c higher than GB. ;) \n\nCrack open aristotle housings like you would an oyster...Only thing worth harvesting is the stem to be modded into other switch housings. 
Better solution would be to just add some tape to insulate those pads. :o
That's correct, but date is subject to change to meet certain manufacturing time slots.. 
GUI is in the works. Currently the programming is done via editing batch files, which is a lot easier than compiling QMK. 
Haven't planned on making any 96 key PCB....but options are of course open. 
If you're into the PCB mounted feel, you can definitely show off the PCB aesthetics, like what jokrik did here: https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/584/31436424243_b79753731f_o.jpg\n\nRealistically, any plate will work. The RGB LEDs are very bright at max brightness and shine through the Zealios without issue. Here's a side shot picture of the PCB set to random colours mode: https://puu.sh/tmsTA/4cab8e6220.jpg
Cheers! :)
This Korean guy did it with Cherry profile caps: http://kbdlab.co.kr/index.php?mid=board_Lsno50&page=3&document_srl=4064062\n\nGoogle translate says it feels like "realforce+alps". 
Wobble reduction and updated stem colours would be the most noticeable differences from R1->4 onwards. 78g would be quite similar to MX Green weights, but with a smoother and more tactile bump. Cherry's line of clicky switches aren't actually that tactile. 
It should, as they're using WKL PCBs. Might be a bit tight fit though as WKL PCBs have tighter PCB mount switch holes. Just squeeze the legs a bit with needle nose pliers and fit won't be an issue. 
Er... :(
It's actually ABS doubleshot from GMK, licensed by Cherry China. 
65g and 67g are safe bets. Great first timer Zealio weights to go for. ;) 
Gotta lift more. 
Maybe in the future! 
;) 
Everything the Zeal60 supports, Zeal65 will. 
Just updated OP, thanks. :)
Yes, of course. You'll just have to desolder and re-solder the LEDs and make sure polarity is right. 
Everyone has different preferences when it comes to lubing, you really have to experiment. I personally recommend the thick lube I sell though, as it works great for zealios, springs and stabilizers. \n\nTry covering all faces of the switch with lube, minus the tactile legs. Add lube on the bottom housing rails + spring inside and out. 
I'd say stick with 67g then. 65g is more of a bubbly bump than 67g's, if you can imagine that. 
> SoonTM\n\n^TM Soon
GB price is already the lowest price we offer to our customers. D: \n\nYou get a free spudger as an installation tool for the Zealencios if that counts. :P
65% PCB should be ready in a month or so...but the case is still being designed and needs prototyping. Expect the 65% kit gb to launch probably around Summer time. \n
Yeah, the items you see right now will be back as an add-on to the kit. 
No problem, ask away! 
Beautiful setup! :) 
Should arrive well before Mira does! 
You can insert them into those hot swap boards, but the switches might sit at a slight angle depending on how tall the LEDs are. The milky bottom Zealios don't have a cutout for SMD LEDs. That said, mounting (RGB) LEDs onto the top of the PCB isn't the best option anymore as you can mount them onto the bottom of the PCB like on Zeal60. 
Last round Zeal60 actually had another import tax that wasnt calculated in the sale price. :/\n\nWe've also arranged for a custom darker purple soldermask this time around, which adds to the cost a bit. \n\nZeal60 supports split backspace and stepped caps. 
The Zealencio clips shouldn't affect downwards travel of SA keycaps whatsoever. Only the upstroke will be reduced by a tiny bit, but most people won't notice it ad their fingers would be on another keycap by then. 
Zealencios work with every board using Cherry stabilizers and any Cherry/Gateron/Zealio switch. The clips are tight on purpose -- to dampen the keystroke. The supplied tool helps install them, or you can use a flat head if you prefer that instead. 
TKL is planned for the future. 
R4 onwards 78g spring weight was updated to be accurate. R2/R3 had a weight just a tiny bit heavier than 67g 
The screw in stabs are meant for plates that support PCB mount builds, or simply builds without plates. These plates usually have a simple rectangular cutout and the stabilizers just poke above them a bit. Plate shouldn't be touching the stabilizers at all. \n\nAFAIK, plates that support plate mounted stabilizers natively support PCB mounted stabilizers due to PCB mount stabilizers having a smaller footprint, unless there is some serious issue with the stabilizer hole cutout. \n\nEdit: universal plate showing PCB mount stabilizers fitting in "plate mount" cutouts: https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=41464.0;attach=17056;image
Shouldn't be any issues. However only the upstroke will be noticeably silenced. Bottom out not so much as the cross stems underneath the cap aren't the same height as Cherry profile caps. 
You would have to pickup the switches/silencers/stabs off my site as the drop on MD is for the PCB only. \n\nIn addition, you will need to source your own aluminum case & 60% universal keyboard plate to build (either via GBs or China). 
Oh wow that's a really dark purple then! Sorry, obviously didn't read the top post. :o
Unfortunately there are no plans to make a non-gold-plated variant. It would split up the order count and reduce order sizes which doesn't help the MOQ. 
Lube makes everything better. If your environment is clean and you don't eat around your keyboard, cookie crumbs/dust shouldn't be an issue. :)
Will work on proto pcbs once CNY is over. PCB design is ready, just need to test. 
I've built up a few boards with the transparent stabilizers and swapped many times and haven't had an issue. As long as you wiggle upwards it shouldn't pop out. Not sure how often you'd be swapping keycaps a week for it to accidentally happen. When I built a board with regular Cherry stabilizers, the wire popped out when super tight caps were mounted. I always recommend squeezing the horizontal stem cross a bit if the fit is tight with caps. Not always needed, but different keycap manufacturers all have different tolerances. 
Much smoother than Cherry stabilizers and no mush or rattle. :) 
No changes for anything R5 
Thanks! 
tl;dr, /u/JDragon is asking for me to revive linear Zealios? :o
Zealios go from $0.75 during GB to $0.85 during Pre-order. 
Anne pro and pok3r rgb will both work with the clips. However if you use Cherry profile keycaps, there might be some interference with the top row. If you plan on using the stock keycaps, you won't encounter any issues. Only the upstroke will be dampened. 
You'll need to desolder the whitefox & LEDs in order to mount Zealios. If you're referring to the Zealencio silencing clips, yes they will fit. You will just need to trim a bit of the edge on the clip for the stabilized keys as costar bars get in the way. 
After importing the first round of Zeal60 PCBs, there was another tax that wasn't calculated in the original price =/. We absorbed the cost and didn't talk about it, but this meant R2 had to have a slight bump in price. The custom darker purple soldermask blend also is a special request this time around, which we feel would look a bit better / match the Zealios better than the R1 PCB.  
/u/fangske, you have sinned. https://puu.sh/u9vBm/6faf8b4c81.png
If you give the Zealio housings a good lube job, it's one of the quietest typing experience you'll have. Just make sure you don't add any extra lube on the tactile legs or the tactility will diminish. 
Thus far, there hasn't been a single [in-switch + stabilizer RGB LED PCB](https://puu.sh/tmsTA/4cab8e6220.jpg) that's fully programmable via QMK. It also has aftermarket modding support for RGB underglow via RGB strips if you know what you're doing. Adding RGB LEDs underneath a PCB is simple, in switch, not so much. The PCB is also made in the US, vs in China, so pricing is quite different. Zeal60 programming via QMK also doesn't require users to compile their own hexes. Just edit a bat file and run it. \n\nOverall, it's up to you to decide whether or not a premium PCB is worth it. There are definitely cheaper/simpler PCBs out there, but to reach a certain price, corners have to be cut somewhere. Users seeking "end game" parts know what they're buying/getting themselves into. 
The early vids were on pre-released firmware, so that's why the other modes weren't included. I'd make a video right now, but I've loaned my Zeal60 to a friend of mine for a while...it's lubed too perfectly he won't give it back! :P \n\nI'll see if I can get someone else to make a video for the time being, or if I can get my board back before the GB ends. 
Hey mylighterside,\n\nPrices are in USD on my store. 
Yep. The Zealios still have a slot/holes for regular through hole LEDs to fit through! 
Just reply to your order confirmation email with your updated shipping address and I'll have it sorted. :) \n\nSwitches & accessories are also ahead of schedule, so it's looking to arrive sometime mid/late March. 
Yep, works with jailhouse blues.

Check game settings, update drivers, make sure your overclock is stable, make sure your CPU isn't bottlenecking the GPU. Even if it's overclocked there could be a problem there.

Such a pretty setup! Well done my dude :)
So pretty! I hope my axo has gills like this when s/he gets bigger :)
wew lad
Oh! In that case it'll be insanely easy for you. You only have to feed them every other day. Only thing is you'd need sand as a substrate because axos will eat anything smaller than their heads. I'm gonna get lily pipes for my axo tank so the current from my filter doesn't bother him.

Yeah, definitely going to upgrade to a 20long when I get the money. I have the perfect spot for it, too :)
You'll have to get a bigger tank when the axo gets bigger. A 20 long is a good size for one axo. You should also get at least two hidey hole cave-type things, one on each side of the tank. They really like to hide. Other than that, looks great :)
I see that now, thank you!

They're quite easy to care for, actually. I wouldn't recommend keeping it in a little one's room until she's a little older as they can take up a lot of space and be insanely expensive to care for. I blew a few hundred on tanks, substrate, plants, and food for mine.

1. Full brightness on a ws2812 is crazy bright. I doubt you will really want to go past 50% duty cycle as that's already much brighter than about any other keyboard.\n\n2. 60mA is the max possible current draw for *all three* channels on full cycle at the same time. In my experience, 20-30mA is more typical in-application, even at full blast. If you pair this with 50% brightness, you can drive 32 ws2812s off a single port easy. \n\n3. You can use a USB Y-cable to draw more current from a second port. External optical drives use this trick.\n\nFor testing I recommend utilizing an external power supply to measure overall draw before you plug it into your PC. PM me if you need some help setting this up.
I meant it as an insult. I don't actually want to know more
https://youtu.be/QlnLqKL5IHE?t=8m28s\n\nHere they talk about the process
Re: current limiting resistors.\n\nWhatever WS2812 package you use should have the necessary resistors already. Do not add resistance, you should control brightness with PWM instead. The popular DIY firmwares have built-in functions for this.
>  doing some fancy software trick\n\nI believe it's a combination of that and PWM from the hardware controller
Ah, that all makes sense. I had forgotten that they're probably driven by PWM. I hadn't yet had a chance to test real word current draw on my bench top but 20-30mA seems about right.  Thanks for pointing me in the proper direction!

Currently there is no way of doing it directly.  You could get around it by dividing the work place contributions into a monthly rate and adding it to your monthly contributions, or vice-a-versa.
Just put [this](http://meepmoop.com/calculator/) calculator together, maybe it'll help?
I arrived at a rate of 25% from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States#Current_.282016.29_law) assuming I was in the 25% ordinary income tax bracket at retirement.
Good feedback.  The issue with setting a very large slider range is that it becomes difficult for the user to make fine adjustments.\n\nRegardless, the age have been updated, the yearly contribution max is now 24,000 and starting capital max has been increased to 100,000.  (if you have 1M in starting capital you're probably paying someone to make these graphs ;)

Perhaps 'interest' isn't the right value; yes, that represents the increased value based on the rate of return input.\n\nAlso, cash flow may also be the wrong term; not sure what else to name things...\n\nYep, I've been meaning to move the negative values below the X-axis; added to the feature list!
Ah yes, looking at the wrong column :(
Great idea

> What sort of humdity and air movement do you have?\n\nIt's inside a small-ish apartment, so there isn't a lot of air movement and it could be quite dry.  I'll try to adjust those and see if it does any better.  It also sounds like I could give it more light, so I'm going to move it to a brighter room.  \n\nThanks for the great info!
The calculator has been updated to 'loss' as a negative value just like mint does.
You are not "fucked" if you get a 1k raise; you only pay the higher rate on the part of the salary within the bracket.  So if your salary goes up to $38k, you're only paying 25% on $349 (38000-37651) assuming [this 2016](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx) tax bracket
I suppose it doesn't matter, it's one side of a coin I suppose.  I could also ask, "well I want to retire at 60, how much money will I have at that point, I'm 26 now and I'm too lazy to do the math..." :)\n\nThanks for the bug report, it's been fixed!
Voted, it looks beautiful.

Long story, I had an Archon/Mew/Alex team pretty good all 5* and rolled a Mondrian. Immediately switched to Mondrian and was pretty happy about more burst, etc. But I got stuck in 3-18 Hard, been for a couple of days.\nToday saw that I left Archon with a lvl 1 MR (and is lvl 4 now) so I thought what the hell and BAM! tMR on Archon.\nCleared 3-18 first try with almost full health.\nRNGesus finally smiled at me.
In the download page, click bellow "Additional downloads", there you can download the editor (32 or 64 versions)
I worked as a commercial photographer for a few years and started transitioning into video, so I have a few thoughts.\n\nFirst off, how are you defining being exclusive?  Is this with regards to how you edit your videos?  The post look/feel? The composition? The content? Etc. Etc.\n\nIt seems to me that this would be hard to quantify.  Normally (in the stock photography world, at least) a rights-managed license prevents anyone else from using the content.  That comes with a price of course, but allows the client to have exclusive use of the content.  This allows the client to associated the look/feel/content with their brand.  I'm guessing that's what you're going with here?\n\nIf you are going the "exclusive" route, you better have a very detailed contract which outlines what exactly the state of being exclusive means.  Be sure it includes a requirement for a minimum number of videos so that, worst case, you know how much you're going to get paid for the duration of the contract.  Furthermore, ensure that the contract details exactly what they get exclusivity for.  After all, you don't want to put yourself out of work (unless the client is ready to pay you a yearly salary).\n\nI'm guessing that, once you start fleshing out these details, it's going to be become clear whether this is a good idea.  Really, you're balancing the sunk cost of not being able to do the same thing for someone else, assuming this contract goes through.\n\nOn another note, are you really only charging $300 for a single (finished) video?  That doesn't seem near enough to cover preproduction, equipment, insurance, rental, travel, setup, shooting, tear-down, post, client-feedback, etc. \n\nGood luck.
Yep, actually I read [this](http://ninjapixel.io/my-beef-with-pie-charts.html) earlier in the week - not sure why it didn't stick when I was putting this thing together.  I'll probably go with a bar chart ...
Even if it doesn't cash flow and even if it doesn't appreciate (one would thing that at a minimum it would keep up with inflation..), wouldn't I be left with $100k when selling?  Wouldn't that mean 0 taxes and still a better gain than the Roth IRA?
Your flyback diode is backwards. 
**Mechanical:**\n\nif you have any spare CD/DVD roms laying around, I'd crack those open to remove the stepper motor and leadscrew assembly - see [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFo5MKSrM-k)\n\nThis setup should give you plenty of precision and might even be free if you can find an old ROM.\n\n\n**Wireless:**\n\nThere are plenty of cheap wifi boards out there but one of my favorites (excluding all the China ebay stuff) is the [Adafruit Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821).\n\nYou could then use an MQTT server to log your data - Adafruit even has a [free service](https://io.adafruit.com/) for that.
I understand what I've laid out may be too simplistic, I was just trying to reduce the dimensions to make the two strategies more comparable.  I also removed depreciation in order to reduce depreciation recapture.\n\nAs to the deductions:\n> If you or your spouse actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, you may be able to deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from your nonpassive income. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule disallowing losses in excess of income from passive activities. Similarly, you may be able to offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of nonpassive income after taking into account any losses allowed under this exception.\n\n> Generally, if your MAGI is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if you are married filing separately), there is no special allowance.\n\nQuoted from [here](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html)
> Why is your place so hot?\n\nI find it unnecessary to keep my apartment AC set to 70 during the summer; I guess I'm being budget conscious :) \n\nPerhaps having more moisture available to the plant will bring it back to life a bit.
For what it's worth, and depending on how much you made while in Korea, you won't owe any taxes. The [foreign earned income exclusion](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion) allows you to exclude up to  ~$95,000 (depending on the year) from your MAGI.  When I was working in Germany, I always filed and never had to pay anything.\n\nNow, as for proof of that, I don't remember off the top of my head if I even sent anything at all.
The y-axis doesn't show total portfolio value but rather cash flow for the categories of interest received per year, fees paid per year, loss due to inflation per year, etc.
That's all great feedback, I'll definitely get rid of that pie chart.
Back up now.
It's meant to be simplistic, to show the effects of compounding, to show how much you'll lose to fees over the years, and to show the importance of saving each month/year!
Made a similar one but is interactive and shows you the category breakdown:http://meepmoop.com/calculator/
I suppose my goal in putting this together was to educate people first starting out within the world of financial independence or finance in general; so maybe this wasn't the right sub :)
Oh nice! Looks like we're on the same journey!\n\nHow do you like the symmetrical stagger layout? Is it comfortable? Is it any better than the traditional stagger?\n\nI'm new to MK, so could you expand a bit on compatibility with existing key sets?

Now you need 2 separate blocks to stun
Use something you know ALOT (http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html).\nSo you can generate a good history and make the game lore something appealing.\nI know lore it's secondary, but it can make the experience less enjoyable, even if the gameplay it's good
Also, save your components in a variable if you use them on your updates\n
What i meant with 2 separate blocks, it's that now a block (1, 2 or 3 chain) will only heal him 5 times, so he need another block (again 1, 2 or 3) to stun, because the stun happens after the 8th heal.
If you are using force to move a rigidbody, remember to set Drag to something greater than 0.

Games are really high risk inversions, if you want to make games do it for the fun, because you are gonna have a better long term return in almost any other business. Just as an example, Konami, one of the biggest gaming companies with a ton of GREAT games, is leaving behind games to make pachinko machines because in japan their are huge.\nThat said, you can make it big with a game, but it's too high a risk from an investor point of view, that's why things like kickstarter are so popular right now.
We can't help you if you don't tell what are you trying to do.\nBUT, your multiplication is a statement that returns a result (like every binary operation). So you need to asign it to something\n\n    something = transform.Translate(myVector)*speed;\n\nBut if my mind reading is correct, what you need is\n\n    transform.Translate(myVector * speed);\n\n

Most simple idea that comes to mind, is make them aware of peers (enemy array of something) and force them to stay away from each other (if it's to close to a peer move in the oposite direction)\nCombine that rule with get close to player. If they do giggle to much, give priority to them (first one in array selects position first) or only check distance to peers below them in the array or something.\nSorry for being so vague.

The big problem is RNG, most algorithms use a seed (say internal clock) and generates a series, so probabilities between captures are related.\nIt should be expected that the capture attempts before a success are normally distributed, more than this without knowing the capture mechanics, it's uncertain.

What grinder are you using? Are you sure you haven't accidentally put some flavored beans through it before?
Unfortunately, you've chosen one of the most expensive coffee drinks to go to. You might be able to swing a used Gaggia Classic for that price, but that doesn't even include a tamper, grinder, etc. \n\nA grinder will most definitely be the biggest expense; at the very least, I would recommend a Sette (if you want an electric grinder) or if you don't mind a manual grinder, a Lido E(-T). 
> on point\n\nOho, I see what you did there.
I got mine directly from China. 
Is that a Boba Fett USB stick?
It's OK; it's just amusing to see this come up every so often. We're generally a friendly community anyway!

No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. 
Glad I could help!
Since the linked model is parametric, all you have to do is change the unit length from 1 to 2, and then re-render the file. That should generate the needed 2U modifier key (or whatever size you need). 
I've never actually tried Vegemite, and have been afraid to try it since :P\n\nOf course, I don't mind helping out people for Taobao. 
Gateron are like knock-offs of Cherry MX switches, but many people now agree that they are actually better than the original.
My favourite is the brain! 
If using paper/paper towels, be sure to give them several good rinses!
Based on what /u/jgodinez302 did in [this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5vlkm0/working_on_a_little_side_project_for_some_of_the/), I decided to reach out to a contact that I had that could do this sort of embroidery for patches.\n\nThe diameter of the patch is 3.5 inches (outer diameter).\n\nPatches will be made so that they can be ironed on (note: this is not permanent and they can be ripped off if you force it. They are supposed to withstand wash/dry cycles, however).\n\nNo optimization was done; things like the placement of the fonts, arrows/arrowheads, some of the stitching that is unclear (filled in spots when they should be outlined) can be fixed if needed.\n\nMaterial is Polytwill (similar to the material you would find on a baseball cap). Colour of the fabric and threading can be chosen. Design can be changed, but I can envision perhaps 2-3 final designs only (please don't sue me, Cherry).
There's always a reason to spend money in this hobby!
[Deskthority](https://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO) has a good image illustrating the differences!
It's possible that the beans are very light; do you have a photo?
I might setup a second thread sometime later just to get a better grasp on the interest. Mainly, it's cheaper to come up with 2-3 designs on 2-3 materials, at most. There's a charge for every different design, while cost of changing material colour is less, and thread colour changes are even cheaper (provided the threading is all one colour).
My contact essentially said this was just a direct copy of the image that was provided (that was on the Cherry website). There are small tweaks (moving the numbers around a bit so that the patch can be made smaller, for example), or fixing small details (e.g. the bottom arrowhead next to the (3.3) is not centered, the plastic nubs for plate mounting are filled in, etc).\n\nFor reference, the original image is [here](http://imgur.com/a/nQoPq)
Essentially Coolermaster or any of the other brands that have been mentioned are great. 
All depends what people want. There are a bunch of Cherry schematics, and it's up to people to settle on what they want, I suppose.
The site shows them to be modifier keys (control, shift, alt, etc) but in non-standard sizes (such as 1U).
Lido E(-T) is the way to go, if you want a grinder that is under $200 and will be consistent enough for espresso.\n\nThe key to good espresso is consistency (grinder, tamping, everything!)
*Is* Chinese. Well fuck.
Well, I'm not aiming to make money off this; if /u/jgodinez302 wants to run it, it's fine by me :)\n\nJust hoping to spread some love to the community
I rarely use those top 3 buttons, but I wouldn't say that they're extremely hard to press. A bit stiff, maybe, but not too bad. Definitely not as easy to press as the side four buttons though.

Technically, it's Cherry's design. It is available on their website under [dimensions](http://cherryamericas.com/product/mx-series/)

Too bad this is CONUS only! Best of luck to everyone!
I'm just curious (and this might be a stupid question), but when you write 1+8, you mean one complete revolution (16 ticks) + 8 more, right? 
That's a meme I've not heard in a long time....
One thing that you may want to note is whether you require an ISO layout. If you purchase in the US, it may be more difficult to find an ISO layout.
You need 2 Holtites for each switch. For 40 keys, you will need (at least) 80 Holtites.\n\nThere are different Holtites for LEDs (6-1437514-7/6). \n\n

Yup. Saved your post for future reference. Just sent an e-mail off to see if they can whip up a sample. \n\nFor now, I'm asking for single colour, with no thread change. Things like multiple colours, material, etc will of course influence the final pricing, so I guess it'll be up to people to decide what they want (might start an IC thread once I get some samples).
Noon?! I start before 9 am.
As /u/theony mentioned, 3D printing is not a technology that is developed to the point where it is as simple as hitting the 'Print' button - there is still a lot of tinkering that must be done.\n\nIn terms of calibration, once you have the bed level, and the hot end calibrated for the filament, there's not much else to do. That being said though, it's worth the time to do it properly, since it'll affect downstream prints.

Other than the non standard bottom row, they are also overpriced for what you get. 
It's probably a clone of the Tomoko 87. It's a decent keyboard!
I remember when I turned 30.... /gazes off into the distance
I think the biggest problem right now is the lack of (hot) water. While there are some solutions (such as Handpresso), they are more like severe compromises. Additionally, you would still need hot water, so they're not really an option.
Gooble gobble, Gooble gobble!
As long as you like it, it's all that matters.\n\nGenerally, this sub looks down upon mainstream mechanical keyboards like Corsair and Razer, mainly because they are overpriced for what you get. Additionally, they have a non-standard bottom (space bar) row, so if you want to customize your keycaps, it becomes a bit more difficult.
You can hardly purchase a regular dome keyboard for that price, let alone a mechanical keyboard.

What is your coffee:water ratio?\n\nAlso, have you tried the burr stabilization mod for the Hario Mini?
Don't forget the Tada68!
It looks to be an odd size (maybe 7.5U, as you mentioned). Unfortunately, with some companies, their bottom row (space bar row) have odd-sized keys, leading to the problem that you are facing now.
I like that the 60% is -$10 (from base price), but the 40% is -$5 (from base price) lol
Bit of a random question, since Datamancer passed away, who is making these? Did his family sell the rights to a manufacturer?
Wow, it looks like Datamancer finally realized that stabilizers are a thing. I'd be tempted to get a set once these are available in their other styles.
Magic force starter kit #2. Most opt for kit #1, Tai hao Miami.
Didn't hear about that, thanks.
These are pretty silly, and woah that price for a novelty keyset!
IIRC, some of his students took over the business and started producing everything on a grander scale. I don't remember where I saw that, though. 
Right! I was thinking about getting them for a little novelty board and then I saw the price...nope. When I requested the drop I figured the price was no more than $50.
The Magicforce comes with different, but similar keycaps.

Thanks for the information! It's a real shame that the Chinese don't give domestic manufacturers enough credit. In addition to Gateron switches being smoother, I've measured that the dome weights on Noppoo capacitive keyboards are far more consistent than those on Japanese Topres. Here's hoping that domestic production will get more recognition as time goes on.
Thanks, I hope to have a gallery up for that soon!
I keep eyeing Datamancer sets, but I'm not sure how usable the short (non) stabilized keys are. For a $100 keyset, I'd prefer not to be hitting gaps whenever I press shift/enter.
Huge thanks to /u/AWildSweeetsChase for the Rose Gold cap!
Yes. Artisan market's silly, isn't it?
Really? I was tempted myself to buy the US key because of the details on the stars. It's a shame that Jelly Keys are so expensive, their quality's amazing though.
Switch break-in might be a factor, but I also remember reading somewhere that the quality of newer MX blues aren't as nice as old ones. No idea if this is true, since I don't think anyone did any *keyboard science* on the subject.\n\nHere's a thread from GH that talks about this: https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=80154.0
That is amazing. Now all it needs is for the PCB to fit into the aluminum VA68M case and we'll have an endgame-tier board on our hands.
Wow, that looks amazing! I was reluctant to join the drop because it might be difficult getting caps for it. Regretting it now though...
The title is a quote from the Canadian national anthem.
Can you tell me how well the short shift/enter keys work for you? That's the only reservation I have about getting a Datamancer keyset.
Maybe, but I'm thinking that pink wouldn't work well with the gold. I'm pretty happy with the way it is right now, you did a great job!
/r/mechmarket has sellers and buyers from all over the world. I'm sure they'll appreciate a post over there, as long as the post is correctly formatted.
There is hope! Which tracking service did you use? Mine isn't tracked by Canada Post.
That makes sense, thanks! I wonder how surprised they would be if someone told them how sought-after Gaterons are overseas, or that foreigners would even desolder Cherries to swap in Gaterons, haha.
Now that sounds like a kick-ass name for an SA keyset.\n\nAs for the unmistaken Barocco, it's just not something that's at the same level, unfortunately. Granted, it's 1/4 the price, but it also loses out on all the navigational keys I'm looking for.
Wow, that's really unfortunate what happened to yours. Mine also isn't perfect; the stem is a bit off center and I had to file it down to get it to fit in a switch.
These were sold on [TechKeys](http://techkeys.us/collections/artisan/products/jelly-key-flag-keys-pre-order) for $65, the US flag for $80. Since the group buy is over, the best way to get them would be if people are selling it secondhand on /r/mechmarket.
Thanks! I went through 2 pairs of black/white keysets before settling on this one, it was pretty expensive. :(
The item you have selected for 309 RMB comes with a standard black or white plastic case (plus 61 Gateron switches and a switch plate). The item with an orange background and 349 RMB comes with an [acrylic case](https://world.taobao.com/item/523908206281.htm?fromSite=main), the item with the red background comes with an [aluminum case](https://world.taobao.com/item/523921762234.htm?fromSite=main) (these two bundles do not have switch plates or Gateron switches).\n\nEdit: for really complicated orders like these, I personally would recommend strongly that you go through an agent. This way the seller can let you know (via the agent) if you are missing anything, or failed to specify some details in the order comments (you'll need to comment to specify the switch color and case color, for instance). An agent can make sure that everything is in order, and for a non-Chinese speaker is well worth the price.\n\nEdit 2: optionally, try [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Customized-KC60-Full-Set-Aluminum-Case-Programmable-PCB-Steel-Plate-Switches-LED-For-60-Standard-Layout/32620290856.html), where the seller speaks (or at least attempts to speak) English.
I think the best part is how you messed up "reddit.com" but got "mechanicalkeyboards" perfectly.
Wow, 150g springs? You should post a sound test!
Ha, [found it](http://i.imgur.com/wQ8EDwq.jpg). CM hides their diodes really well. Pushing it down makes G register, so I'm just going to reflow the solder and it should work. Thanks!
Yes, you can never have enough expensive rubber domes. But my opinion might be biased...
That's brilliant. I'd totally get like three. :O
Thanks as always for all the links to Chinese articles! Given your exposure to the Chinese community, could I get your opinions on a few things?\n\nFirst, I get the impression that the Chinese don't make a huge deal out of Gaterons the same way the Western community does. It feels like they (similar to the Korean community) still prefer Cherry, and tend to lump Gaterons in with the rest of the domestic switches. Would you say this is accurate? If so, why do you think this is?\n\nAs a follow up: what is the general Chinese opinion on Zealio switches? Given the preference for Cherry switches, would they have a lower opinion of a switch based off of Gaterons?\n\nThanks again, looking forward to more great links in the future!
The common definition is to divide the number of keys by 104 (the keys on a full-sized ANSI keyboard) to get your percent.\n\nWith this in mind:    \n1. The Planck is referred to as a 40% by convenience and convention. At 47-48 keys, it is technically a 45%.    \n2. A 61-key keyboard is a 60%.   \n3. A 66-68 key keyboard like the Clueboard/TADA/Magicforce is a 65%.    \n4. A 75-key keyboard is a 75%, it is not a 60%. Someone must have been mistaken.
The real shame is that Taobao has a very limited selection of Kancolle caps unless you get them custom dyesubbed.
> Canada\n\nThere should be plenty of stores with mechanical keyboards on display. Where are you located in Canada? If you are in Ontario, then Canada Computers is a great choice. For western Canada there is NCIX for BC and Memory Express for Alberta.\n\nAside from the specialist computer stores, you could always try Best Buy, they will have a few on display, but their selection will not be as wide as those mentioned above.
Agreed. The original MMO definition of endgame is when a character has reached max level. So it makes sense that the keeb parallel would be when a keyboard could no longer be enhanced. A new build is the same as starting a new character, which you take to its own endgame.
Digging through all my boxes for the ring pullers took dozens of minutes. Dozens!

Another vote for chiclets for speed. If you're going for speed you won't be able to stop yourself from bottoming out. The short travel of chiclet keyboards means that I'm far faster on one of those than on a Realforce.
Click, Clack, [Moo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GD9CO7S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
Variable force Topre, which I alone love. :(\n\nIt is the perfect balance of weights for all your fingers, the lighter 35g domes are especially important because of how QWERTY overloads keys for the pinkies. This is the switch I choose when I need to code/write all day without interruptions.
What if his prized possession is a snack bowl? You'll be playing right into his hands!
Awesome. Does it take standard MX springs?
That looks fantastic! Any chance for a pink one? I would love one to go with [my Anne](http://m.imgur.com/a/43oTM).
I'm beginning to think we'll never get it.
That's awesome. Hope you make a post when they're in stock. This Canadian has been searching for Fosens for a while. 
Hm, if they rattle that loudly, your clicky pieces sound like they might be really loose. The clicky pieces on my Aristotle sliders don't move until pushed, while the same pieces on Gaterons move pretty easily if you shake them.\n\nIf the clicky pieces on your Aristotle sliders are as loose as those from Gaterons, then it just might be that you had a different batch or something. 
Confirmed
That should be a DIN connector: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector\nIt was the standard used before the PS/2.
You can, here's a photo of mine: http://imgur.com/a/vt0eS\n\nI think it had some sticker residue, but otherwise it was fine.
Don't have one of the SA sets you're looking for, but let me know if you ever feel like selling GMK Royal Alpha. Thanks!
Ew, it almost sounds like a stock Novatouch. Which makes sense, since I imagine Topre probably used the same tooling for the sliders.
We've got one of those at my workplace. The switches are beam springs. I'll try and get a gallery/typing video up sometime this week.
But I've posted [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/4zj36d/photos_yet_another_anne_pro/d6w7w06) before. :(
That's true, it does give more character to otherwise uniform profiles like R3 SA and DSA.
Nothing yet. =/
'neydian!
no thank you
Came in expecting to see another Clack selling for thousands. Glad this isn't one. That's a pretty good buy, congrats OP. :)
*Came* here for this comment, wasn't disappointed.
This was bought on [TechKeys](http://techkeys.us/collections/artisan/products/jelly-key-flag-keys-pre-order) for $65, but are now sold out. They are produced by Jelly Keys, who have recently put up a storefront here: https://global.store.joiha.com/
Picked up mine from the post office today. Glad it's finally arrived, but I'm genuinely curious why it took so long.
Thanks! :)
I knew there was a reason why I impulse ordered 5 gems! :)
Bought GMK Royal Alpha from /u/damonskv
Only three months! It's almost like they shipped it by boat.
It was an expensive cap, but worth it though. And it helps that Americans get to pay more for theirs. :P
Another vote for the HHKB. Silenced Topre basically the same volume as membranes.
There shouldn't be any issues. The PCB and firmware both support the grid layout for the numpad cluster.
One more vote for pink and white combination!
Hm, it looks like your models might be flipped from left to right. For instance, [the tortoise](http://wot.zipek.cz/3d/index.html?tank=gb32_tortoise).
After this it gets really confusing, though. Because everything afterwards is pretty loosely defined:\n\n5\\. Like 75-key boards, an 84-key keyboard is also referred to as a 75%, even though it is around 80%.    \n6\\. A TKL with 87 keys is occasionally loosely referred to as a 80%, even though it is closer to 85%.\n\nAnd we haven't even gotten into whether you should divide by 101 (winkeyless), 104 (most common), or 108 (Ducky) yet, which gets even messier.\n\nIn the end, I think the main takeaway is "the keyboard percentage is just a label, a keyboard is whatever % the community says it is". It's more important to look at the layout of a keyboard in detail than to assign it some ballpark percentage value, after all.
Looking good! Where did you get the typewriter keys on the TKL?
The ZZ96 uses ps2avr, but RS96 uses TMK. This means that the ZZ96 is easier to program, but the RS96 is a bit more flexible with more layers and the ability to code complex macros via the source code.
I'm also waiting on my Trass and Lava cap, shipped out on Dec 1. Canada Post takes an atrociously long time with untracked international mail (typically 1 month+ from China), but this is the longest one in my experience.
Not literally, I hope? :)
Someone should totally organize one, I know there are quite a few mech fans in Calgary. I'm based in Toronto, though, so I can't come. :(
Yeah, with MX it would be completely unremarkable, but I thought this was worth posting because these aftermarket Topre keysets are basically impossible to find now.
PM'd
I'm interested in the bamboo case with 50g springs. Are the springs something I can swap out myself, or should I wait for a future revision? Thanks!
Another vote for checking ps2avr compatibility. Please let us know about the LED hole sizes when you're able to check, thanks!
I even counted mine. There should be 31 points, but WG thinks I only have 29. I suppose this is what I get for believing that WGNA could get anything right when they couldn't even code a self-updating third-party service.
And then variable-weight Realforce gets left out again. :(
They look nice. Not as great as GMK Royal Alpha, of course. But for $65, they don't have to be.\n\nI'm really loving the influx of Chinese DSA/SA imitations. Hopefully we'll see more competition and lower prices from SP/PMK.
You could look into getting a Winkeyless keyboard with the acrylic diffuser case for a similar lighting effect. Plus WKL has a faster turnaround and a lower price.\n\nWhat I really want to see though is these caps on something with sliders over rubber domes, for double the membrane feels.
Found it on Taobao, tempted to get a set. How is the quality, especially compared to nice PBTs on the TADAs?
A
Dang, how does that feel? It looks way better than Corsair's attempt at making a lapboard...
This one's a Taobao custom, I've posted a build log [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/4xjik0/reviewhelp_taobao_fake_bpad_is_it_worth_it/).
Completely agree. I use keyboard lighting to complement my keysets, and RGB gives the flexibility to match any set without having to desolder or mess with SIP sockets.
Fellow IBMer here, I have yet to see a single Model M at the office. We've got loads of Selectric typewriters on display though.
I have tried lubing Zealiostotles before, it should be okay if you only lube the legs and sides of the switch. Don't lube the springs or the insert that goes into the springs, because that would dampen the click.
I didn't know him before your comment, but now I'm convinced that he's the coolest person ever, thank you.
We did it, reddit!
I really like how well the caps work with the metal plate and floating keys. Which keyboard is this?
That's exactly what tends to happen. You get a bunch of people and their keyboards together to talk about the hobby, see the recent SoCal meetup for [an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/53g353/photos_socal_meetup_2016/).
Augh, I also jumped straight to a Realforce for my first board. "I have Topre now, I think I'm done!", I said.\n\nA year and a half and a dozen keyboards later, I now realize how silly I sounded.
That's amazing. Do you have a list of everything you've tried? Which keyboards are in your collection right now?
With the latest firmware, they've added the feature where the backlight shuts off automatically after 1 minute of inactivity. Annoyingly, it doesn't automatically turn on once you resume typing, so you need to hit Fn+R to turn the lights back on.
Looking good! Can [my Anne](http://imgur.com/a/43oTM) come too?\n\nI've had a similar experience with the stabilizers. The one on my spacebar is so loose that if I used a thick PBT spacebar it wouldn't bounce back properly. Your issue sounds fixable though, have you tried lubing the stabs to see if the noise goes away?
I was in the same boat at one point, the problem is that you're forced to settle for a compromise keyboard for the sake of the volume wheel. I recommend that you get a [dedicated volume wheel](https://www.amazon.com/Griffin-Technology-NA16029-Multimedia-Controller/dp/B003VWU2WA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472583030&sr=8-1&keywords=volume+wheel), which should free you to get pretty much any keyboard you want.

I would always do this and "whoops" my way into [[Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre]] or [[It That Betrays]].
I'm not familiar with Bhiner, but I'm assuming they have some sort of customer support. Try getting in contact with them and letting them know.
Those aren't niblets! They're little rat poos!
Lightning Bolt, Hella, And So I Watch You From Afar...
I mean, out of the easily obtainable Cherry switches, they're my favorite... but I prefer clears, or Zealios especially. Tactile is a way of life.
There's a PCB called "Let's Split" that is akin to the ErgoDox.
That would be illegal for USPSA. :) 
I wish this was the start! This was only my first build. I have an ErgoDox and Pok3r currently, and this is my third board altogether. I'm loving it! 
yo bro this is sick dawg ye
Don't forget, we check email 3 times a day... 
Dude!!! I'll be transferred there next semester! I sure hope we'll be able to connect, since I started the addiction not too long ago...
Fly high, airman! I'm goin' through tech school right now, and not being able to build anything at all is super tough (I worked at the LBR store in STL, so very frustrating). \nWhat AFSC are you lookin' at?
I mean, we only had six at the STL Lego Store... That's rough, guy. :(
I certainly agree with it being comfortable! It's just a little too light nowadays for me.\n\nDo you know if the Mionix Naos has a decent weight to it?
[[Gutter Grime]] during OG Innistrad. \nI think I pulled maybe 40 of them? I can't remember having any other rares.
I actually got the keycaps and the 2-piece case as a gift, and the Zealios came out to around $50 or so. So really, I managed to build the board for $100 with the GH60 and the Zealios. It would have probably been close to $200 if I didn't have those as gifts. \nBut, I've been using it more than my Pok3r. The switches feel so much better, and the case is so dang light. It's my new daily driver. \n\nEdit: forgot to mention that I struggled to find a driver for the GH60 that worked well for me. u/robotmaxtron has a great one on GitHub. Reminds me a lot of the poker 2 layout. 
Cyrillic subscript?! 
[[Frog]] and [[Green Ball that's Red]] because Jund lands matter too, ya know!
Well... I'm still waiting on 3run, but I don't mind waiting on this. :)
They're probably not *vintage* blues, but regular blues, before they started using their own switches.
Now handwire it and make it an ergonomic nightmare!
I'm a huge fan of Cherry MX Browns, but Gateron Blues are making me feel I can never go back...
Please ignore the lack of a spacebar; I didn't have a full keyset that I could afford to utilize completely!\n\nBig thanks to u/skiwithpete for releasing the LJD61Up! It's a really study case/plate to hang onto the PCB and switches. \n\nAnd zealios? In the wise words of u/ChucklingKumquat they truly are the way to your feelios, They're R4.5, if anyone's curious. I know there were issues with wobble in the last few rounds, but these seem to wobble even less than Cherry switches (which in my experience isn't really saying anything).
I use a messenger bag I got from the Esri UC last year. Small enough to not be ganked, but unique enough to be recognized as mine.

Absolutely, without a doubt, [[Riptide Shapeshifter]]. When you only have on Eldrazi in your deck ([[Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre]]), you start beating face ridiculously fast.
You're also getting a variety of switch types if you order 27 testers...
Mg15 Storm is my absolute favorite so far, but the A-10 is just so difficult for me to use... To top it off, it seems like every single kill on me is using it.
Unlimited? Beta?! ALPHA?! WHAT IS IT?!

[[Tuk-Tuk]] is a good time because of dying a lot!
If you're deadest on those two keyboards, go with Corsair. The build quality is better (but only barely). However, as many others have suggested, go with either Ducky or CoolerMaster for an entry level keyboard. The quality is far superior to both Corsair and Razer.
The deck I use him in is super heavy Voltron - pop him out turn one, throw some janky buffs on him and swing for game by turn 5 at the latest. It's a good time, granted that no one has any removal to pop him with.
He's decently slow (you have to really prep for him to hit the battlefield), but he's insanely explosive. Once he's out, you best be ready to draw way too many cards. Any spells like [[Alhammarret's Archive]] or [[Thought Reflection]] absolutely need to be on the field as you're starting to use him, otherwise he just lets you stack your deck, which is definitely not a bad thing. Of course, [[Venser's Journal]] always works well too, just as a backup strategy in case you're taking bad beats. As others have said, [[Diviner's Wand]], [[Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind]], and [[Psychosis Crawler]] are nuts paired with him and any draw doubler, as well. \n\nHe's a little janky, sure, but I don't think I've ever had more fun with a commander. Plus, the precon that he came in is oddly geared toward him better than Mizzix, I feel...
I was the only one who bought one at the STL store yesterday. You're seriously all out?
hashtag no filter
These really confuse me since (at least) the enter key uses two switches for stabilizing instead of stabilizers... Not having experience with it directly, I'm not sure how it would work. I'm sure one of them is loose, but it's just a little odd.
/u/That-Canadian thank you for the various caps and switches!! I put the rainbow DSA on my ergodox, and hooph does it feel interesting!

Don't go with Corsair for your first keyboard! Ducky tends to have awesome value for the money, sure, but usually they're hard to try in person before buying one. Check out the CoolerMaster keyboards, as they tend to be a bit cheaper and have a good build quality for the cost.

Reds don't provide tactile feedback - they're linear switches. Browns, Cherry MX Clears, Zealios, MOD switches... those are gonna be your best bet for tactiles.\n\nIf you want it compact and having a numpad, that's gonna be tough... You'd be better off with a TKL or a 60% if you want compact. As for it being wireless, I know there's more than just one out there, but most of them are escaping me atm. The only one that comes to mind is the Anne Pro, and it's a 60% that connects via Bluetooth. It's relatively cheap, as well.

You're giving it to someone? Frankly, the Corsair tends to have a *marginally* better reputation than the Razer. However, what they use is going to be up to their preference. Go ahead and give it to them - the switches are likely different. Who knows, they may end up liking it more than their own purchase!\n
If you can get a Ducky Shine 5 for $100, absolutely jump on that. Especially if the Cooler Master ends up being more than it. It's a fantastic starting board, and it'll have a majority of the features that I'm sure you're looking for.
The fact that it's new doesn't mean that it's worth getting a better, cheaper keyboard. The Cooler Master kbs are really, really worth the price, and very customizable. They're all around good starter keyboards. But, if you're dead set on getting a Corsair, then by all means! I have a K70 and while it's not the best keyboard on the market, it definitely works! You just can't change the keycaps (which trust me, you're gonna wanna do. The stock caps on the Corsair boards are so thin and flimsy).
That looks like a tree to me...
Most custom keycaps you'll see support Cherry MX-like stems (so not Romer-Gs). If you're looking at getting a K70, you're going to struggle with getting custom keycaps. The bottom row is non-standard, which means that the size of each key is different from the norm. If you want to change keycaps, you'd be better off looking at Ducky, Varmilo, Leopold, or even Vortex for customization.\n\nIn regards to switch types, there's no way to judge how you'll like them. The best way to go about learning which switch is best for you is to actually try them out. Go to a store and see if there are any keyboards on display that you can try out, or buy a switch tester online. \n\nThere's a lot more research that needs to be done than you'd expect from this hobby. It bit me in the butt my first time around. Here's to hoping you don't make the same mistakes I did!
I guess technically it was M12/M11 white weenies... Griffin Rider was my best friend. :')

I think he might be better as BW, too... He's definitely not an evil dude by any means. 
Go for something other than the Corsair keyboards. Ducky or CoolerMaster is often suggested because of the cost, and the standard bottom row. It makes customization easier in the future, should you want that. Plus, they both offer RGB keyboards with numerous switch types (with the exception of Cherry MX Silent, which is a linear switch). \n\nA suggestion could be to go to a store where they have those boards, such as a Best Buy or a Microcenter, and try out the switches and see which you like the most. 
You've gotta give some specs, my friend. I'm assuming you're on PC? What GPU do you have? Is there any error that shows up when/if it crashes?

Are you using an external Bluetooth adapter or does your mobo have it built in?\n\nAlso, I can relate on not wanting to buy from Banggood... but I've got other reasons for that that aren't worth going in to. Glad you like it, though! (Borealis is a hell of a set, isn't it?)
No, there are two items that you can get in-game: The New 3DS and New 3DSXL. Both of those allow you to play puzzle league on ANY 3DS.
Right on! That makes it a bit easier for a visual comparison... the difference is nigh negligible from what I can tell, give or take the height of the keys.

I currently use a 60% .\n\n I literally never use a num pad, and since I have a DAC and AMP for my headphones that has a volume nob on it I don't need a second on my board, so right there I could cut down to a tkl. \n\nI currently never miss the function row (only thing it was used for was print screen, and during gaming recording functions) these can all be attached to a different layer or just different keys though I currently don't do that and still barely miss them. So there I can cut down to a 65%\n\nFigured I wouldn't miss arrow keys or some of the mods so I could cut down to 60%. Been using 60% for about 5 months now. Realize I do in fact miss actual arrow keys, and wish there was a little more room to display a couple more artisans. So have a 65% and a tkl on the way to see which I am happier with.\n\nI probably will end up staying with the 65% and getting a Rama 6key macro pad when they drop for instances where I actually do miss having a real key for something.
Damn lucked out and went in for two awhile ago. First mx binge caps otw!

Nope, typically a keyset runs once in a group buy format every 1-2 years it seems. After that you have to check out /r/mechmarket to buy one in the aftermarket. Though you're in luck and supposedly it's supposed to run again sometime this summer

Always thought Rama made cool classy stuff but never felt the need to buy. But then I followed and joined the m65-a gb, and now I feel I need this. I'm starting to get worried
Correct! 
Just got some hotlites in that I purchased from you on mechmarket and they look just like gold hotlites should look! Haha hope to win some more in this giveaway as I do have two customs coming so still need to cover another board :).\n\nAlso I'm not sure if you know, but are hotlites compatible with ergodox pcbs?
i'm jealous you had enough money to win both this bbv2 from keypress and the pompakull from keypress (though i don't see it pictured). Big fan of the pompakull one!

Real life comes first good luck with everything.\n\n\nI find this very funny though, (let me preface by saying this is a good price and I'm not complaining about your listing at all! Just other users reactions). \n\n\nYou post a good price for a rare keycap and say the money is for medical needs and every single person is okay with the price and basically just says good luck to you. You could be completely lying (I don't think you are) but people just take your word for it and not one complaint about the price.\n\nMeanwhile I see someone post a 1 of 2 snapper for a good price as well yesterday and half the thread is people complaining about how high the price (even though it was half of your cap for a probably rarer cap, think there was a few of these? Could be wrong).

damn those 55g domes go quick!
yup have to agree. besides the bottom right the rest seem to have a blue base. his is purple base. So we're looking at at least 6, I'd wage a guess at 10 though.

Been getting spikes as well randomly, usually muchh worse then in your video, last a couple seconds then completely back to normal. Mine just started with this patch
Uh I have a Hubble Mira tkl coming in a few months, total cost to get that was about $500, then mod-ms for about $70, zeal teams stabs for $45, SA carbon mixed with SA pulse blue legends for about $500, uh then artisans for at leastttt another $200. So about $1350 total. Should I probably just resell everything and upgrade my laptop to a pretty good desktop, yes. But damn my keyboard is going to look pretty fucking sweet.

Woooo Zarya 2.0!! Don't get me wrong I'm excited for this hero. But ummm let's see it seems her alt fire is a smaller form of zarya ult, her two abilities are a throwable shield (basically a zarya shield for more then one person) and her other regular ability makes her impervious to CC and takes decreased damage like zaryas own shield. And her ult increases team wide damage, while all of zaryas abilities help to increase her own damage. So yea basically zarya 2.0 but there's more emphasis on aoe

Did you even read the article linked? Articles are not censored, there is a process to flag articles as disputed involving 8 major newspapers.\n>Under the system, if an article is reported as false by users, it will be sent to a portal that all eight media companies have access to, according to Le Monde. If at least two of the companies confirm the article as false (with links to support their claims), the content will be flagged as disputed in Facebook’s News Feed, and users will see a warning before they share it. Advertising against the article will also be blocked, Le Monde reports. \n\nThe idea is to prevent bogus news agencies making outlandish claims, like during the US election, when most of the fake news traffic was coming from Macedonia from people looking to make a quick buck.
How to avoid accidentally ruining your keyboard: ruin it intentionally!\n\nEDIT: thanks /u/HeyBehr for reminding me about[ this](http://i.imgur.com/KhJHisn.jpg)
>Nous livrons uniquement en France Métropolitaine, pour toutes livraisons vers les DOM-TOM ou vers l'étranger veuillez nous contacter\n\nOnly ships to France, for international delivery, contact the seller (that might put a dent in the budget).

Those are pretty expensive though.
See my and /u/Glorfindel212's comments above, if the election was held over the next month, she would not win. No way. Now we will have to fight against her during the rest of the campaign, but she is not the threat Trump was, not just yet anyway.
Yup, it's quite frustrating knowing you are paying for your brand new GMK set being shipped from Germany to the US and back to Europe, with the possibility of being charged 30 to 50 euros in customs and paperwork, when shipping would be much cheaper if you could buy a set directly from GMK. And there's the paypal currency conversion fee no matter what.
I really like the 1976 color scheme, so I was better off trying to emulate one on WASD, and it's pretty cheap as well.
Same rate for my language, what a joke of a company. Never had any hopes anyway, I don't need new customers ATM so it's all good, but seriously, these guys are parasites.
You don't "need" any type of switch for gaming. Also, popular streamers usually get free stuff if they show it on their channel.\n\nIf I were you, I'd take a look at the Wiki and do some research around here, you'll soon discover that gaming keyboards are usually not your best option (quality, non standard layouts, proprietary switches).
It's not about the female lead, it's about being a love story in a spaceship. This is a good love story, but a bad sci-fi movie.
I'm in the same boat as I use an AZERTY layout on an ANSI board, I just used the[ Windows Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx) to remap the missing key on the alt-gr layer.
That's what I figured, but the vetting process threw me off, you have to attend a webinar and submit your CV, and only then can you work for them. This is quite unusual for this kind of companies.\nAnyway, I'll try it out and report back, not holding my breath on that one, but who knows.
[It is](http://shop.caps-unlocked.com/product/varmilo-va87m-iso)\n\n>The following ISO Layouts/Keycaps are available:\n\n>- ISO - UK \n- ISO - GERMAN \n- ISO - FRENCH \n- ISO - SPANISH \n- ISO - ITALIAN \n- ISO - NORDIC \n- ISO - PORTUGESE

I think [this one](https://en.zfrontier.com/collections/keysets/products/es-lingua-franca) ticks all the boxes if you can wait until April/May.
Wait, so you keep watching your hands even with blanks? That kind of defeats the purpose of blanks, have you tried forcing yourself to watch the screen instead?
It will show up when someone looks up HP in this sub, might as well leave it.

Yup, sounds like Trump and his new friends, like Richard Spencer, who calls mainstream media, especially outlets critical of Trump, Lugenpresse.
No, it can only be capped from outside now, the whole team was literally useless being inside.
> It's been outlawed, but people still do it from time to time.\n\nYou'd think they would only do it once
I'd recommend anything with a 6,25u spacebar so you don't end up regretting your purchase the day you want to change caps. A lot of gaming keyboards have a non standard bottom row, I would avoid them for that reason.\n\nI have a Ducky Zero with mx blues, i'm satisfied with it. I also have a Steelseries 6gv2 with mx blacks, it's fine but has a big ass enter key, so customization is harder.\n\nMy new daily driver is a 60%, I have some projects for the Ducky and the Steelseries, I'll probably use them again down the line.
Yup, that's what I figured. In the meantime I asked a German shop, and they told me they could still sell to France until June apparently. I'll buy a few bottles and see what happens.
Except it's not the same company, but yeah the color looks similar.
As long as you find a color you like for the modifiers it's all good. They don't have to be the exact same tone. 
There's an [IC thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=76080.0) for an orange/white SA set on GH. There's a [massdrop poll](https://www.massdrop.com/vote/REBEL-A-keycap-set-from-a-galaxy-far-far-away) as well.\nI'd love to get the Aurebesh alphas.

If you can't fix it by cleaning the switches/updating the firmware, you can try [this](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Keyboard-Chattering-Fix.shtml). I use this with a board that has a couple faulty switches I need to replace. 
Pretty sure it's a bot (comment history).

IIRC there is no such thing as an HP mechanical keyboard.
Meant azerty (still have the ISO left shift and <> next to it), reposted to avoid looking like the idiot in the room, thanks
Oh no problem, but you might want to mention that somewhere, it doesn't look too great otherwise.
I don't know the shipping restrictions with this vendor. \nRegarding the modifiers, you could always just buy the alphas from this set and buy a set of DSA modifier from another vendor.
From WASD, this is going to look very bad compared to an actual 1976 set but this board still has it's original caps after 18 month, it has to be fixed.
What I did for French AZERTY is use the ISO layout and just remapped "<>" on alt-gr ";" and ":", that matches the ANSI layout, just have to use the modifier to access them. \nI remapped the keys with [MS Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx).
It's a very popular Signature Plastics set called [1976](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-1976-keycap-set/). I wish I had one of these.

They do not feel exactly the same. Some people will take Gateron over Cherry MX any day of the week, some people will prefer the Cherry MX. That's why testing them is the only way to know what you prefer.
Varmilo is about to make one: http://shop.caps-unlocked.com/product/varmilo-va109m-mechanical-keyboard
I think the Professional version is the same, the Ultimate version being the identical but with blank caps. As for the caps, Das Keyboards use Cherry MX switches, which means you can buy any MX compatible caps, the easiest type to find.
If you want to compare everyone's translations of a same document, I'd use any translation software that allows several translations of a same segment being stored at the same time in a TM (no overwriting). \n\nEither use a shared translation memory, you'll need to be on the same network, or import everyone's translation in the same TM, without overwriting existing translations. \n\nOnce everyone is done with their respective translation, go over the document again, and the "lookup translation" part of the CAT tool you used should show all the different versions of every segment. You might want to set the max number of lookups to a number greater than the total number of students involved, otherwise only the 5 or 10 latest translations will show up.\n\nIf you use Trados Studio, hit me up, I can help you set that up, if I understood your request correctly. That should be doable with any CAT tool, but I'm only 100% sure about Studio.
I had to find a way to end the gradient with black to work around [this clusterfuck.](http://i.imgur.com/rNDFXoc.png) I'll post the actual keyboard when the keys get here in a few weeks.
I thought you'd have a script to say something clever when someone calls this account a bot.
I'd get all the Cherry, all the Gateron, all the Zealio, since they're the most popular oustide of DIY, then pick another one.
It's a click, and that's a lot. I type all day, I am a freelance translator, and I type around 70,000 characters a day, I know that since I had to use Keyboard Chattering Fix at some point, and it logs your stats. My most used keys, AEIOU and space, are actuated a few thousand times each days at most. That means 50,000,000 key strokes would last around 30 years @5k strokes/day every day.\n
No problem, Arrival is one of the best movies I've seen these past few months, loved every minute of it.

It's called chattering and can be caused by a variety of factors, see [here](http://imgur.com/a/fyxIg), scroll all the way down or Ctrl+F chattering.\nIf you can't track down the cause of this issue, or if you don't have time to solve it right now, you can always use [Keyboard Chattering Fix](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Keyboard-Chattering-Fix.shtml).
I see that answer every time this question comes up. US-international is just not an option for some languages with diacritics. I'm French, I'm using an ANSI board, but I've remapped < and > to the alt-gr layer on the AZERTY layout. Having to use dead keys for accented characters is a huge waste of time. \nWhile I'm not familiar enough with Swedish, I know for a fact this is a no-go in other languages.
Please, copy and paste the lie, show me where I lied specifically. 
If that matters a great deal to you, get yourself a set of double-shot keycaps. In those, the legends are physically embedded in the keycap, they can never wear off.
I could access just fine this morning here as well. Are you using Google's DNS by any chance?
Anyone care to do a TL;DR on the drama? Surely I'm not the only one out of the loop here.
>Expensive\n\n>$47 WASD set\n\nSweet summer child...\n\n\nLooks great though!
I don't want to sound like a dick, but why make the poll then?

The bottom row is where your space bar is, the standard bottom row is 1.25 - 1.25 - 1.25 - 6.25 - 1.25 - 1.25 - 1.25 - 1.25 (these are units, 1 unit is one alphanumerical key). \nWith a non standard bottom row, you can't use customized keysets, at least not a full set. \n\nThe point is, if you want to change your keycaps later, you won't be able to, you will have to keep some of the default keycaps.\n\nMore info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/keycap_guides#wiki_key_spacing).

Being in Europe, do you process shipping like MD, that is to say, you get all the stuff from the vendor and send every order to each buyer or do you have plans to ship from the vendor directly? I'm asking because the only way I'm going to use your services is if it saves having my stuff cross the Atlantic twice (like for GMK sets for instance). Any plans of having a European fulfillment center at some point in the future if your venture works out?
Change your DNS settings, I was getting a DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error using Google DNS (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4). I changed to OpenDNS (208.67.222.222/208.67.220.220) and everything works.\n
You're not factoring that it's 50 million for each key, not for the whole keyboard.
The reports go to 8 news agencies, who then have to provide proof that the article is factually false. Then the article is just flagged, not even removed. 
Because your dick and balls is totally the same as the fingers of a guy who processes honey...
You could unplug the keyboard from the keyboard side with one that has a removable cable. If you get a keyboard with micro USB, you can use a magnetic adapter so you don't even have to fumble around to plug it back.

Yes, the 6GV2, which has this very annoying big-ass enter key. This was my first mech, a year and a half ago. I'm working late at night these days and I don't want to wake my roommates with my mx blue board, so I dug up this one that has mx blacks.
That's absolutely not what the article said.
Yeah, like when KAC says "massacre" you're supposed to understand "non existing terror attack".
It looks like [that](http://i.imgur.com/1kwEP3q.jpg), you can search for micro USB magnetic cable/adapter on amazon, you'll find a ton of them. You can also use an [adapter](http://i.imgur.com/oOdWij9.jpg) to place between the cable and the keyboard, if for example you want to a nice custom cable.\n\nEdit: User /u/yellownurbs posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRuFOuUqEEY&feature=youtu.be) of a few days ago showing just that, full thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5vkz1m/halp_cant_stop/).

Well deserved

Why the roses there if I may ask?
Ugh yes. Hazel is my favorite tbh 
BLOW THE FUCKIN WHISTLE 
I agree. He's not a target forward and the midfield and formation is treating him like one
I wonder what follows this 🤔
It was intimidating seeing it in person the first time. It's so big! 
Just in the MLS realm, I much prefer Orlando's and Portland's crest.
He ended his career with them 
FUUUUUUUUCK YOU FS1!!!
I dont like how he died earlier in the game
Ugh, I'm one of those people lol. I hate the green seats. If you compare our stadium with others they all have seats that match and it looks really nice. I hope they do replace the seats with blue and yellow ones. Same colors as the Chargers too. 
ooooh I get it now lol

How many square feet is your apartment? 500sq foot family apartment over here. \n\nI like the room. Might have to get some of those shelves. 
Isn't that like when grandma gives you an ugly sweater for Christmas though? Just say thanks and never wear it haha.

I like the smell of what you're cookin stranger.
Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.
I don't see the Kore as a purchasable option. Was it at one time?
From Amazon or somewhere else?
The things on your wall seem a little haphazard to me.\n\nMaybe move the self with your HOTS figures (the one below the ST ships) to the right of the shelf with the ship minis.\n\nIt would give it some symmetry.\n\nThen you could rearrange the posters/framed art. Maybe space them out a bit more.\nI don't know, that's all i could think of and I'm kind of drunk. Nice set up.  
Mom jokes. 
I see one on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Qisan-Mechanical-Backlight-Cable-Black-Magicforce/dp/B017N5SH6S/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1484936632&sr=8-3&keywords=magic+force) but it has colored LEDs can you change the colorways or is this a different model?
Oh god I needed that laugh.
Honestly, that was my first thought too. 
I bought 3 FN-2187s when they came out (left plenty on the shelf). They were for coworkers that paid me back retail price. Maybe the other guy wasn't a flipper but either way that's great you got one!
I still upvoted you because you made me laugh in r/funny.
Whoever told you that is a dirty liar.
Looks good to me.
Thanks! It's a little out of my price range but i did pick up some other things! Wouldn't have even know about this collaboration if I hadn't been on r/mk haha. 
If we get this and a casual Dad76 skin...I would think about possibly maybe buying a couple of loot boxes.
In. Thank you for another giveaway.
If you are getting harassed for call outs, then yeah, that isn't right.\nIf you are trying to command your team and get out of "ELO hell" then it's normal for people to react badly to this and may be why you are called bossy.\n\nAny other factors such as jokes about your gender and whatnot are just going to happen. When people are bad mouthing they will zero in on whatever specific factors they can. I play with a guy who has a southern accent and he was accused of being a hillbilly in the kkk. It's just what people do to try to hit you right in the insecurities. \n\nEither just play passively and stick to call outs (that's what I usually do in solo, even though I myself do not have a vagina) or find a group. Even playing passively I still will get badmouthed often but having a regular group you play with goes a long way towards reminding you that there are normal friendly humans to group up with.\n
Games and Anime look great at higher framerates to me but when I watch anything live-action in a higher framerate it makes me nauseous. I don't know why but it makes me dizzy. 
Well, to be fair, with the title of the post and the screenshots it's an easy assumption to make. 
I'm kinda glad that you do.

Good luck cleaning that.
The human eye can't see more than 37fps so it shouldn't really be a bother.

Tried to convince my GF to get one to go with her white setup and get cool guy points by having a GF that's into mechs but she will never dump her full size Logitech.\n\nUh...anyway... I like your keyboard.
That view is dreamy.
Big difference! That looks great buddy. 
Nice! Thanks buddy. 
He buyed it that way.
Shishkabob build.
My brother is in a chair and will use a catheter to pee while sitting in his car before we go into a building. He will usually only poop at home. I don't think I've ever seen him go into the restroom. It's honestly hell on road trips with him because he can use a catheter to pee while we drive on the highway and expect me not to use the bathroom for 8 hours... but I get to use my legs so I guess we are even.
Now your setup is inspiration and the circle is complete.
Hey you're welcome. I just woke up sober. \n\nSo I'd space the stuff on the wall out more and try to have some sort or plan for making it symmetrical. You can also google "gallery wall layout" if you have a bunch or randomly sized stuff. Otherwise I think your desk looks great and I'm jelly of that mousepad. 
It is true actually.  My father was a fighter pilot and could only see at exactly 37fps. He was highly decorated and last year finally retired so he could make framerate jokes on Reddit that go over people's heads. 
I haven't played in a while. I just remember when I would lay down in my Aurora's bunk my window view was blocked by an engine or something.
Ever get that feeling of véjà du?
I'm dead inside and this still made me smile.
I know about Ducky's build quality and good reputation. I've had a Shine 5 with MX Reds for a couple of weeks before deciding to sell it to a friend (I wasn't a fan of Reds).\n\nThe thing is, I'm interested in the MK Pro M specifically because of the layout which is an hybrid between a fullsize and a TKL. That Ducky One is almost the same thing as my MK Pro S. And the price + shipping and conversion from UK pounds to euros is more than what I'm willing to pay for, so there's also that.\n\nThanks for the suggestion anyway, but that's not what I'm looking for.
https://www.overclockers.co.uk/ducky-one-tkl-rgb-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-brown-cherry-mx-switch-uk-layout-kb-21v-dk.html\n\nYou have this one too which is better than CoolerMaster
http://www.coolermaster.com/product/Lines/keyboards\n\nIt looks they are gonna sell them soon 
Realforce RGB https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2114 if you want to put your GMK set into a Topre keyboard. However, the Novatouch is a great alternative because it's a TKL (f you prefer this size) and this keyboard is cheapaer than the other one
Are you joking ?
Just get a switch tester and avoid Corsair
Varmilo VA87M or VB87M and Leopold FC750R = Better options
LOL
https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ikbc-full-size-rgb-mechanical-keyboard\n\nProbably this oneif they're a mx clear version (will be avaible at mechanicalkeyboard.com) or wait for the Varmilo VA108M or VA104 with RGB 
Not all the keycaps
What's the keyset name ? I have forgotten it\n\nHowever, nice keyboard and how does the 30g topre feel ?
budget ?
Where do you live ?
Varmilo, Leopold or IKBC they come with stock PBT keycaps 
Varmilo VA108M or VA104 = best compromise\n\nYou have the same quality as Leopold because it's the same factory and backlight.\n\nAnd you can customize it more and we have a Varmilo representative into this subreddit \n\nEDIT : I have forgotten the IKBC MF-108 RGB https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ikbc-full-size-rgb-mechanical-keyboard \n\nNormally, this one will be available at mechanicalkeyboards.com this month
RGB suck as f***
Leopold FC750R\n\nVarmilo VA87M or VB87M (Bluetooth) which is the same quality as Leopold with backlight and more customisation https://i.imgur.com/lR6zKLT.png (we a Varmilo rep into this subreddit)\n\nVortex Pok3r
I love you Varmilo <3

HYPE !! HYPE !! HYPE !!\n-\n
Many topre owners say that you doesn't get a full topre experience with the Novatouch. Also, the sliders isn't as good as the other topre keyboards (less solid and thin). \n\n/u/DeltaIntegrale is 100% correct 
Kailh switches avoid them. CoolerMaster , Ducky or IKBC 
No problem's ;)
you can order directly a keyboard from Varmilo. You just need to contact the Varmilo representative into this subreddit ;)\n\nThey were in sale at CAPS UNLOCKED too http://capsunlocked.bigcartel.com/product/varmilo-va87m-iso and http://capsunlocked.bigcartel.com/product/varmilo-va109m-mechanical-keyboard
Yeah :)
Amazon.jp
You can add the Realforce RGB which  have cherry mx compatible slider 
Filco topre board ? :D \n\nI think you want to say Leopold. The Leopold keyboards are as good as the Realforce. Many people prefer the HHKB for the layout or the "thock". However, the quality construction isn't as nice. \n\nIf you want the best Topre keyboard you need a Leopold or Realforce
Varmilo with cherry mx green ;)
Leopold or Varmilo (if you want backlight) would be the cheapest and will last you longer without any keycaps problems etc ...\n\nThey're the best for the price
Neither because  the majority of the keyboards marketed as "gamer" have a non standard bottom row thus you will have many difficulties to find a replacement set when your keycaps will have a shine effect over time (and quickly) because they are made with thin ABS. IN addition of that, they have a lot of internal components problems (LED, PCB).\n\nPrioritize a TKL size because it's more ergonomic than a full size keyboard\n\nCoolerMaster , Ducky and IKBC are the go to go especially IKBC because it's  100% programmable keyboard, have a full aluminium case and PBT keycaps  (link below)\n\nhttps://www.massdrop.com/buy/ikbc-87-rgb-mechanical-keyboard\n\nThe IKBC will be available at https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/ this month or http://mykeyboard.eu/ or  https://www.candykeys.com/ if you live in Europe  \n
Avoid Corsair keyboards. Overpriced for what they are\n\nRGB = IKBC F108 RGB or Ducky shine 5 or 6, CoolerMaster Masterkeys L\n\nBackligt = Varmilo VA108M (my favorite between all of those keyboards) or Deck Hassium\n\nNon-backlight = Leopold FC900R  (my 2nd)  and Filco Majestouch\n\n\nIKBC , Varmilo, Deck and Leopold come with stock PBT keycaps but IKBC haven't a detachable cable. \n\nVarmilo is the more customizable and we have a rep into this subreddit
Hi,\n\nCan you make a typing video please (or something like that) ? I want to hear this beautiful keyboard in action :-)
Thank for the reply :)
https://www.reddit.com/user/JOWQH/comments?activity=comments 
IKBC MF108 RGB or MF87 RGB and you have the perfect RGB keyboard
Overpriced for what it is. There are better RGB keyboards like IKBC, CoolerMaster and Ducky
Leopold FC980M or 900R\n\nVarmilo VA108M or VA104 \n\nYou have the best keyboards available for the price.\n\nWe have a Varmilo rep too into this subreddit
For a non RGB keyboard : Leopold FC900R , FC980M or Ducky one \n\nFor a  backlight keyboard : Varmilo VA108\n\nRGB = IKBC MF108 , CoolerMaster MasterKeys  L RGB 
3 HHKB O_o\n\nWhat do you think about the Leopold FC660C and FC980C ?
Probably the Leopold FC660C , FC980C or Realforce 87U (especially this one)because there are 45 and 55g versions are the more suitable options
Avoid keyboards like Corsair, Razer or Logitech because they have a non standard bottom row, poor keycaps quality and many LED problems. \n\nAlso, the Romer G have a pretty bad feeling and zero replacement keys possibility.\n\nCoolerMaster MasterKeys L , Ducky shine 5 or 6 and IKBC MF-108 RGB with the aluminium case (especially this one)  are the go to go\n\nhttps://www.massdrop.com/buy/ikbc-full-size-rgb-mechanical-keyboard the IKBC will be available this month at mechanicalleyboards.com
No problem's ;)
Perfect !!!
Yeah you can buy a wrist rest separately and they are far better if you really want one
Thanks 
Mais ce n'est clairement pas un bon coup tu as du Ducky au même prix et pour moins cher du CoolerMaster.\n\nEn plus pour 145€ CAPS UNLOCKED a du Varmilo en ISO FR
Thanks\n\nCan I buy the spacebar separately ?
Is RGB important for you ? Backlight is enought ?
RGB = IKBC F87 RGB , Ducky one TKL , CoolerMaster Masterkeys S\n\nBacklight = Varmilo VA87M (my favorite top in everything) , VB87M (Bluetooth version) , Deck Francium\n\nNon-backlight = Leopold FC750R (my 2nd) , KUL ES 87 and Filco Majestouch\n\n\nIKBC , Varmilo, Deck and Leopold come with stock PBT keycaps but IKBC haven't a detachable cable. \n\nVarmilo is the more customisable and we have a rep into this subreddit
They're overpriced :)\n\n
https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/vortex-pok3r-rgb-iso-mx-blue-without-keycaps_19/ + https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/pok3r-rgb-iso-german-keycaps_35/ and you have a discount = 145€ 
First time I've seen someone who prefer low quality cherry mx fake over the real :D\n\nAlso, the model doesn't have a lot of wobble in comparison to the cherry mx switches and Razer switches aka kailh switches wobble more than cherry mx switches
http://candykeys.com/ and http://mykeyboard.eu/ have or will have Leopold FC660M with ISO UK or DE\n\nAnd http://shop.caps-unlocked.com/ will have Varmilo VA68M with the ISO layout in a couple of day
no problems ;)
Probably WASD have keycaps for non standard bottom row keyboard but this will cost you a lot and the build quality is low.\n\nAnd they aren't backlight friendly

Contact the Varmilo rep :)
Normally there is a Realforce 104U 10th anniversary all 45g but I think you need to order it at Leopold.co.kr and use a proxy
\nRGB = IKBC, Ducky or CoolerMaster\n\nBackligt = Varmilo (my favorite between all of those keyboards) or Deck \n\nNon-backlight = Leopold  (my 2nd) , KUL  and Filco \n\n\nIKBC , Varmilo, Deck and Leopold come with stock PBT keycaps but IKBC haven't a detachable cable. \n\nVarmilo is the more customisable (bluetooth version too) and we have a rep into this subreddit
180g Zael Plann
VB87M = Bluetooth but not the VA87M \n\nAnd we have a Varmilo rep into this subreddit 
no problems ;)
The CoolerMaster seem to be the best choice available. I don't know if you can find a IKBC MF-108 for 125$
You can contact the Varmilo representative into this subreddit to order one from them\n\nThe keyboard with a Japanese name is Filco ?\n\nWhat about Ducky one , shine etc ... ?
Ducky + usb Hub + remap your keyboard
What you need is a cheap membrane keyboard and play this when you type on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAmiYr0GjaY 
Enjoy your cup rubber life ;)\n\nHow do you like it ?
Awesome. How do you like it ? However,can you make a comparison between the two keyboard ?\n\nBuckling spring and Topre by far my two favorites switches but it would be really interesting to know which one you prefer.\n\nCapacitative switches are life !!\n-
the Leopold FC980C is a really good keyboard too :)
responded :)
CoolerMaster or Ducky are far better in term of build quality and the wrist rest isn't good for your wrist but if you really want one you can one separately which is better than Corsair one
Master Race no ... But Welcome hope you like your keyboard and prepare your wallet :D
Varmilo = Leopold = same brand\n\nVarmilo is the one they use in China and Leopold in Korea. However, Varmilo is more community friendly and relatively new in comparison with Filco etc ...\n\nVarmilo offer Gateron , cherry mx grey, clear , green etc ... Aluminium case etc ...\n\nWASD = the best clear and green because you have one no ?\n\nFilco offers more aftermarket customisation because Filco is relatively old. I'm totally agree with that but still overpriced (with WASD)
A keyboard like that https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/2wn8qp/photos_my_new_varmilo_va87mr_with_mint_keycaps/\n\nVarmilo have keyboards with green PBT keycaps and green LED
Avoid Corsair too if you want to have a good keyboard and not an overpriced one. CoolerMaster, CoolerMaster or IKBC if you want RGB
Vortex Pok3r or Varmilo VA68M RGB
Varmilo VA87M or VB87M (if you want Bluetooth). We have a Varmilo representative into this subreddit\n\nLeopold FC750R or Leopold FC980M\n\nThese keyboards come with stock PBT keycaps but you have more customisation with the Varmilo one (backlight too)\n\nAnd get a switches tester ;)
Varmilo VA108M with cherry clear. You will have more customization than the WASD code and stock PBT keycaps. Also, we have a Varmilo rep into this subreddit
Nice keyboards :)\n\nAmazon.jp if you want keycaps for your Leopold
Yeah Varmilo is the chinese brand of Leopold and you can have a aluminium case too :)
If you want an overpriced keyboard WASD and Filco are the go to go
https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=867 120$ ??!!\n\nCorsair = poor keycaps quality , they felt solid for you but the internal build isn't as good as CoolerMaster (for the same price). Also, they have a non standard bottom row which is really annoying when you need to find a replacement keyset.\n\nNon detachable cable \n\n"In fact they looked great" for you ... For me, they look ugly as f*** and designed for kids
Varmilo VA109M = PBT keycaps, backlight (blue if you want) and you can customize it \n\nhttp://shop.caps-unlocked.com
The Whitefox is so sexy ❤ \n\nLucky you !
Nice collection. I love the /u/p3xon cable too :D\n\nNeed to order one of your beautiful cables when I will buy my Realforce. Keep up the good job !
I've heard Mykeyboard.eu https://mykeyboard.eu (probaby CandyKeys too www.candykeys.com ) will have Varmilo keyboards this month (ISO nordic too) for 118 euro\n\nIf you can wait ;) You will have a keyboard with stock PBT keycaps and backlight which is better than the Filco
Varmilo or Leopold  get one of these !!
Welcome dans la community? Comment est tu aimé ton keyboard ? :D
<3 <3
No you can have a far better keyboard for the same price.\n\nWhat do you need for your keyboard ? backlight ? RGB ? 
Varmilo = same quality as Leopold. It's the same factory but Varmilo is backlight.\n\nDeck come with stock PBT keycaps (and backlight )when Filco and WASD it's thin ABS keycaps\n\nWASD and Filco are overpriced (and overhyped) in comparison with Varmilo, Leopold and Deck atm
Varmilo is good too (same quality as Leopold)  and we have a rep into this subreddit\n\nCan contact her to se the option for you
The Pok3r RGB isn't 170€ ...\n\nhttp://www.candykeys.com/vortex-keyboards\n\nhttps://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/category/mechanical-keyboards/60-mechanical-keyboards_4/
Neither. Coolermaster
Corsair is overpriced like Razer or Logitech. There are better keyboards for the same price
Np :')
RGB = IKBC or Ducky\n\nBackligt = Varmilo (my favorite between all of those keyboards) or Deck \n\nNon-backlight = Leopold  (my 2nd) , KUL  and Filco \n\n\nIKBC , Varmilo, Deck and Leopold come with stock PBT keycaps but IKBC haven't a detachable cable. \n\nVarmilo is the more customisable (bluetooth version too) and we have a rep into this subreddit

CoolerMaster , Ducky and IKBC are better if you want a RGB keyboard.\n\nVarmilo and Leopold are the best for the quality

Yesterday or the day before there was a post on Reddit where we should post our weird keyboards. There was a black model which was exactly like this. If you search for the post you should find the name of it :)
You're right, seems like it was a bit too early for my brain,lol. Maybe the brand of this one can help him if the company has produced similar keyboards.

Mechanical keyboard owners of r/ph, san oks bumili ng keycaps locally, (kung meron)?
Bumili ako ng G300 for 900 something pesos. Buhay pa rin ngayon, though looking back, sana yung G100 na lang binili ko. Mas mura at hindi kasing complicated ng G300, na may mga extra buttons na hindi mo naman pipindutin, extra profiles na hindi mo naman papansinin.

What colour solder mask are you gonna make? I kinda want a black one :) 
You need HADapter kits, incidentally the GB was created by a German (hence HAD
Read the wiki, it's over there - - ->
I did not know you can just flash the hex to a nerd board like that, I always thought with these GON PCBs, reprogramming the bootloader first is a hard requirement 
Generate .hex using qmk, convert it to A .bin, then drop it onto the tada using the normal mass storage method 
What are you on about, most modern non gaming boards have 6.25u space 
Shift is either 1.7u, 2.25u or 2.75u. You're better off using the 2u numpad Zero key
Pming
Check under the label and the rubber feet. Screws are usually hidden there 
The Cooler Master Masterkeys series had visualiser function. Stay away from corsair or razer 
Yep and they're both fully functional 😀
If you ever want to replace the caps, yes
The tada plate does not support switch top opening. If you want to do anything, you will have to desolder the whole board. I have a tada from the very first round and have converted it to iso layout by swapping out the default plate for a custom iso one 
Are you sure that's doubleshot? It looks just like uv etched abs caps except a little thicker. \n\nEdit: After having a second look, I'm 99% sure it's just uv printed shine through abs, especially considering each cap has SP many sublegends, as well as front print, and the domed windows key
Thanks! 
Well seeing as Gateron manufactures the blank keycaps for MOD and Enjoy PBT to dye-sub the legends onto, they should be exactly the same, physically speaking
Who needs food when you can have keycaps! 
You can't just have a sandwich case with just any random top plates. Usually the top and bottom have to be designed to match so that they screw together (usually with a threaded insert in the acrylic section) 
I suggest switching your computer to US-international instead of US-ansi and learn to type with US-international key map. It has all the umlaut and accent keys to support pretty much all major languages 
You're not gonna want to pair that with a laptop. Kustoms usually go for 3+ kilograms
Size is more defined in terms of percentage. This is a condensed full size board. Stop arguing semantics. 
I do have my tada on qmk because I converted it to iso layout and the tada original key mapper doesn't support iso. There's nothing to really 'go back' per se, you are not replacing the bootloader. You're just using qmk to generate the key map .bin file instead of the online tada keymapper
I see, I think there's an option to do that in Windows too, but I use ISO-UK which is close to ANSI with only a few differences and I don't use the accented characters all that much 
Is this case tray mounted like typical 60% cases or does it mount the plate to to the top housing using a bespoke cut plate (à la Kustoms)? 
Well I know I am 😉\n\nThere's currently a gb on GH for GMK Dolch with pretty decent iso UK coverage and add-on kit for 1800 and other non standard layouts. I'd say you should pick it up if you like Dolch colours 
Pming
You have access to a CNC mill of your own? That's awesome! Would you let me use it? :D
OG Cherry is one of the best keysets you can get. Wodan is due to start round two of HADapter within the next month or so
Obviously this is not a one size fits all solution, but I do know it's not a problem with accented characters if you take the time to learn the key map. I use it for Vietnamese which I can assure you has many MANY diacritics 
Well all keyboards are the same to a computer. Just swap the command/options key in software or something. The rest of it should behave exactly the same doesn't matter what keyboard you are using 
They're not made out of solid gold... Just stainless steel with gold plating...

Imsto actually sells tiny silicone balls that is sized so you can drop it inside the stem well of the bottom housing to get this same effect. Worth having a look if you're too lazy to cut out small felt pads
Absolutely no details given as to what you need. Budget, form factor, switch type, layout... Those are all the things you need to tell us if you want anything useful at all. None of us read minds.\n\nGo and read the wiki on the sidebar and post in the daily sticky questions thread. 
For sho man, I'm out and about at the moment, I'll draft a detailed email later ;) 
No
TKLs exist for a reason! I suggest you try them out
PCMR sells them for really reasonable prices too
Cherry 11900 came with a 2u Shift. Outside of that, I can't think of anything else. You might be able to use the numpad Zero key in its place. 
More secure feeling, easier to tune to eliminate rattle
To build a custom Topre board, you will have to buy and actual Topre board, scavenge all the sliders and slider housings, and machine a custom plate specifically for it. And design a custom pcb. And design a housing, and write custom code since capacitive switches like Topre does not use column scanning like contact mechanical switches like cherry or alps. Not many people has all the broad interdisciplinary knowledge to do that
Adblock + no script is a thing 
You can buy them new from Oco here: https://www.originativeco.com/products/gmk-spacebars-6-25-7?variant=16795174725\n\nEdit: Whoop I didn't read properly, seems you are already aware!
HADapter are made by GMK in abs, so for the best match ideally you would get HAD doubleshots, although if you are keen on PBT, I suppose it will still work with SAD dyesubs
I see, so I'm guessing your case will be a lot closer to the original G80 case than the one I'm making! I guess that means I haven't totally wasted my time! \n\nWill you be making the case out of aluminium or are you investing in injection moulding dies? \n\nAlso could you elaborate a bit more on the improvements to the L3 PCBs you are talking about, I just contacted leeku last week about procuring some L3 PCBs for my own 1800 projects, and would very much like to hear what improvements are being made. I hope you haven't got exclusivity over improved PCBs 😱\n\nFull disclosure 1800 is my favourite layout and I am a Terminal GB participant ;) 
+1 would buy one! 
You will need to order a custom printed keyset from WASD. What you want doesn't exist 
Confirmed
That is awesome! I am UK based as well. Did you come to the recent meetup? I might even have bumped into you without realising 
Stretch your budget a little and get a Masterkeys Pro S https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01D8ETGJ0/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488391711&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&keywords=Masterkeys+Pro+s
' is used as a modifier for the keys like é á and the likes for example ' and e makes é
Different things for different purposes. Magnesium is more susceptible to corrosion, magnesium dust is a fire hazard, and doesn't have great high temperature performance. 
Your best bet is a new keyboard tbh
That is actually exactly how it works. A lot of the time when I try and pull out my caps on MX clear stems, the whole slider and switch top comes off with it. Doesn't bother me personally but worth it to keep this mind
WASD doesn't make 75% boards, what are you on about, they only make full size and TKLs (and rebrands the Poker) 
Not mechanical, it's a rubber dome with a metal clicker to make a noise 
Alpine Winter
Product pictured on amazon don't usually reflect the actual items. If you buy the Nordic Masterkeys Pro S, it will come with the proper iso configuration (iso enter and split left shift). You cannot simple buy an ANSI layout keyboard like you linked and expect it to work like an ANSI board, it's missing a key (split left shift)

Ah yeah but you can't compare tai hao caps to OG Cherry / GMK can you? 
Depends on what game you play, but as far as I'm concerned, any lag is unacceptable, and going Bluetooth by itself introduces latency due to the Bluetooth stack overheads. Not to mention the Convertibles don't even have Bluetooth 4.\n\nInterference would also be a problem. I don't need any more devices clogging up the already crowded 2.4GHz spectrum.\n\nUnless you really absolutely need it, wireless is totally superfluous. You also need to check if the Convertible can operate in wired mode when plugged in. Some Bluetooth devices operate under Bluetooth even when plugged in (i.e. No data passes through the cable, only power) 
This might fit the bill \n\nhttp://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/swedish-finnish-filco-majestouch-2-tenkeyless-nkr-tactile-action-keyboard.asp
It's a 550 paracord cable. I don't know the exact colour code, check his website maybe? 
You need 2 sockets per switch 
Same (I'm in the UK and EU orders hasn't shipped 🙁) 
6u spacebars from Gateron (epbt and other dyesub makers) and GMK all have offset stem position. Swills tool output is correct. If you plan to use OG Cherry caps, GMK or Gateron PBT 6u spacebars, do not change this switch offset (or widen the cutout manually if you want the ability to use both offset or centred stem) 
The word you're looking for is an **ISO layout** keyboard. The ones I suggested are both available in a wide range of iso flavours (German, French, Spanish, Italian, Nordic etc..) \n\nFilco boards are good too, but they're a bit more expensive 
Why ask for renders when the set has already been made years ago and photos of the actual thing exist? https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/40/d9/70/40d970056c320ca5f91c1ca2c17f00c8.jpg

Wireless keyboards are just not great for gaming in general. If your primary use case is gaming, you might as well keep it plugged in, and if you're gonna keep it plugged in, why pay extra for wireless functionality that you won't use? 
Leandre from mekanisk.co has stabs, and his store is based in Norway 
Unlikely to ever happen. Iso versions of the Apple aek has horrifically non standard layout
Switch your keyboard to US-international instead of ANSI-us, then you can get the pound sign by using Alt Gr+numeric 4
I did the same a while ago, after converting my TADA68 to ISO (i.e. TADA69!)\n\nSorry potato pic: http://i.imgur.com/UwjurEN.jpg\n
That's the customer-facing website for Signature Plastics, so that's pretty much the only place where you can buy retail sets in SA, DSA, G20 or DCS profile caps

Damnit, there goes my unoriginal idea of remodelling the G80-1800 case with case mounted plate... \n\nI'm guessing you will be using the Leeku L3 MX 1800? Or will you be asking him to design a new pcb entirely? 
If it doesn't fit your usage case, you are free to NOT use it. Clearly there are other people whose use case matches the layout (seems like programming/web design is a popular case). The layout was designed for more economical finger movement. \n\nThere's a reason it's called Happy Hacking Keyboard and not Happy Gaming Keyboard. There are plenty of usage for a keyboard beyond the WASD cluster. 
It IS a full size 104 key. The fact that it's narrower doesn't change the fact that it's full size. 
Pcb-Mount switches only with minimal programmability and high price? I'll pass... 
You need need to keep in mind that all stabilised alps cap produced by SP uses cherry stabilisers instead of the alps style inserts 
A guy from the mkuk group designed a pcb for this very thing: https://imgur.com/gallery/B3hV5
Why would that affect you? If you're bother by the winkey/Alt placement, you can swap that in OS settings. The rest just works like any other keyboards. Why would you think Mac OS interprets the keyboard any differently to a Windows pc? 
I prefer having a plate TBH, but obviously subjective.
No. Use a hexadecimal to binary converter
I like in the UK but use ANSI 70% of the time for practical reasons (all the pretty keysets have ANSI support lol) 
Yes. Stabilisers isn't something you're gonna need to replace if you installed them properly. I prefer pcb mount stabs more than plate mount (both cherry and costar) . Also, if you use a universal plate, you HAVE to use pcb mount stabs 
I believe GH60, Infinity and WKL PCBs all support 6u layouts so you could build true hhkb layout 
they're all variations of the stock keyset that was present on dolch keyboards.\n\nThere's quite a few variations but you covered the main staples - regular and sky.\n\nocean is new and hasn't been produced yet. There's also a miami dolch/ivan dolch which incorporates pink.\n\nGMK produced regular, sky and soon to be ocean (as well as miami/ivan)\n\nSP produced regular dolch but in DSA profile\n\nThere's also Tai-Hao's copy of regular dolch in ABS.
Ah okay. Turns out I like Tai Hao caps, then, haha
Don't forget the Red Dolch set for Alps/Matias which were on Massdrop a few days ago. I was sorely tempted by them, but I intend on having an ISO Matias switch keyboard rather than ANSI.
Not sure who makes it, but there's an ABS Dolch that comes on the KBP v60, as well.
That would be Tai Hao :) 
FYI Miami dolch is called "Dolch reborn"
It was an Ad on the front page, which was obviously aware of my Reddit browsing history. I would never have seen it on my desktop, but I don't have Ad-blocker installed on my phone.
O-rings are very cheap, and they come in a variety of colour-coded thicknesses and hardness ratings to choose from.

Is there any reason you're not offering Clears as a standard, as opposed to a special request?
If memory serves, this was from an older Reddit thread (which I didn;t bookmark) in which the poster says they emailed Obins and were told that another firmware update will be coming out which addresses the macro problem.
Looking fine! I usually think of black cases being boring, but this is one set which really suits it.
17track is a bit patchy. Sometimes it gives me accurate tracking from Banggood - all the way from China to the UK, other times it shows nothing until my package is in the UK. In which case I just use local mail tracking.
I would recommend it. The 35g domes are so light that they are essentially linear. Maybe you like that, but the 55g domes feel much better, IMHO.\n\n\n\nAs for difficulty, it is very easy. The top shell of the board simply clips into the bottom half, then the plate and circuit board which sandwhich everything else simply lift out. **Do** be careful to detach the cable leading to the usb lead though.\n\n\n\nThe rubber sheet it easy to replace, but I also wanted to lube all the sliders as well - that's the task that was tedious and time-consuming. After that the plate needs to face key-side down, and be propped up on something, so the keys don't push the sliders back at you. Then the new dome sheet should fit easily.\n\n\n\nOne thing I wish I had spent more time on would be the placement of the inductive springs inside the rubber domes. I had all of these straight and aligned, but because I hadn't propped up the board securely it was sliding around as I was screwing everything together. I got impatient and, after most of the screws were in, grabbed it and screwed the rest in while holding it at an angle. I think this caused one or two springs to misalign slightly as I can hear a couple 'springing' when in use.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't bother me enough to disassemble and re-seat them though.
After Fn+B, you press 1,2,3,4 to choose the channel. Fn+1,2,3,4 saves the channel.
Really!? I feel like it was ages ago? What's happening to me... ?
I sometimes get this when it connects for the first time. It usually goes after a few moemnts, for me. What Bluetooth mode are you using? When in Bluetooth mode hit 0 (or it could be Fn+0) and it will try to switch between power-saving mode and compatibility mode. This might work.

How many rests did you take during the soldering phase? Did you need to tank up on caffeine to stay focussed?
There are three default profiles built into the keyboard, before creating any of your own.\n\n\n\nHold down both Ctrl keys: this will show you on your number row which one you are in. No. 1 is the standard, No. 3 is the Mac compatible layout.\n\n\n\nWhile you have both Ctrl keys held down, tap the Windows key. This will increment which layout you are in. It takes seconds to change layouts, so you should have no problem.
Love the typeface.
Bingo! I knew I wasn't going nuts. I always lose track of keysets which release in different profiles.
This may be a silly question, but have you remapped it? If you you will need to press the new CAPS key, but the LED under the original CAPS will light up.

Thank you.
You might say it's an... IceBox.\n\n\n\nDo you see?\n\n\n\nDo you see what I did?
My fingers had acclimatized to the force required, and I didn't like the quieter sound of the dampened switches. I did at first, then I think I got too used to the sound and liked the way they used to sound without the rings on them.\n\n\n\nFor me they were a temporary help for my stabbing fingers which were used to stiff rubber domes.
Black, green, and red is one of those combinations I would never have tried, but now that I see it... looks good.
I realised I was using cables which came free with other devices. When I used another USB cable the OTG connection worked fine.
I really wanted Devlin, a local UK company, to do well breaking into the enthusiast market. I joined this GB from the beginning and by the time the first delay was announced, I was already impatient to begin my build, as other projects were demanding attention.\n\n\n\nThe absence of homing bars, as well as the delay, was an issue for me so I'm glad I stepped out of the GB then, and moved on to other builds. I sympathise with those of you waiting on this set for your own build.
Thanks
Any time you get too excited... just think of those extra plum novelty keys, and get more excited.
Hold down both Ctrl keys: this will highlight which layout you are in. Tap the Windows key until you are in layout 3. This uses the Mac layout which, I think, moves Cmd to where Alt is.
1) Push in the reset button on the back to see if this clears up the issue. Try the keyboard plugged in first.\n\n\n\n2) If not then Go into Bluetooth (Fn+B) and hit "+". This switches Bluetooth on and "-" switches it off. Though if your board isn't working when plugged in then it may have a deeper problem.\n\n\n\nAlso, I've heard of some boards getting glitchy if you try to use the Bluetooth with the cable plugged in as well.
Yes, I've owned mine for a few days now and it's done it twice. I think I remember someone talking about the dongle not being the highest quality, so maybe that is the culprit.
Okay, I thought the Round 5 GB was the only way to get one.
Yes, I tried them on my very first Mech, a Filco with Cherry Browns. I came to that board from a rubber dome where i was used to bottoming out *hard*. When I used the browns my fingers were stabbing down into them and jolting my finger bones. The O-rings helps me get used to he softer touch required but then I removed them after a while.
As well as what ICKitsune said, these sets don't really depreciate in value. In fact some sets appreciate quickly.\n\n\n\nIf you did buy these, then got bored with them months later and sold thrm, you would at least get all your money back - maybe even a bit more.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, as someone posted a few days ago: it's like you're getting the caps for free.
The change is very minor, that's why I mention the lubing and stabiliser work having the main difference. The reason I insert the felt is to eliminate some very minor high frequencies which I can sometimes pick up on certain keyboards. Once I hear them, I can't ignore them.\n\n\n\nIt's a very subtle difference and needs to be considered againt the impact of lessening the cavity within the board.
Looking smart as F
It's the same for me. Bluetooth disables my media control, yet it works when wired. Although the mute icon in Firefox tabs doesn't work if my Anne Pro is plugged in. It's as if the Anne is hogging volume control all to itself.\n\n\n\n(This is on Ubuntu 16.04)
Oops, I must have confused this with another board I was looking at. There were only browns, blues and reds available. I've made the edit.
> clear,... tactile grey...\n\n*Swoon*
Thank you! I thought I'd buggered my board when I Iubed my switches: convinced that I had damages the PCB when i was puching the keycaps back on. Now I realise that I must have pushed both the Alts on at the same time.\n\n\n\nThis feature I actually really useful when you want to navigate with one hand while drinking with another.
According to Jessica she has designed many many sets but sent this one to GMK and, months later, they sent back some renders showing what it would look like. \n\n\n\nSo she didn't just design one, this happens to be the first which is being produced by a company.
Dewd *slap* DEWD!
Oh yes, I forgot all about that stage! I actually used some pieces of thin plastic which I cut into shims and slid them under the stabilizers.
Every time someone says they missed a white Anne Pro w/Browns in the Banggood sale, I become just a little  more smug.\n\n\n\nTyped on my white Anne Pro w/Browns.
There's no reason to be flippant either. Telling people not to be "angry" or "blamey" in a thread where resigned disappointment is the prevailing mood, is slightly off the mark: especially when capped with 'It still looks good if you think of it as Mint, IMHO, YMMV'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're all mature here, we all know the nature of group buys and the risks they entail.
Yes, the Anne key is responsible for Macros. However - people are reporting that the macro function of this keyboard is highly glitchy. Obins claim they will addres this issue in a firmware update this year.
Go into Bluetooth mode and toggle "A", that might work.
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll try that sometime.
You should be able to do this over the Android app. There is definitely a problem with the iPhone app if, as in your screenshot, it isn't displaying a blank square for the Fn layer.
Yup, I had to dig my way out of that GAS rabbit hole. I thought mechanical keyboards were helping me by providing a reason to sell off lenses I wasn't using anymore... if only I knew.
I don't know of anywhere that will sell individual PBT caps, but I would look for a single 1.25u blank white cap and a single 1u cap. Those are teh "measurements" of the caps you need, and you already know what their function will be, so blanks will be easier to find.
Even if you go through with a spring swap, which means de-soldering every switch, bear in mind that it may increase resistance but will decrease tactility.
It's necessary if he doesn't understand why people have a problem with the Razer brand. Everyone was a newbie at one time.
All the tactility of a Topre switch comes from the dome: the spring is there to register the actuation, not provide any meaningful feedback.\n\n\n\nThe caps and sliders would already be weighing on the springs and almost activating them, with hardly any force required to bottom out immediately.
Definitely download the app.\n\n\n\nBe aware that the ANNE key has no function use right now, as its macro is incredibly buggy with the current software.\n\n\n\nSome key combos are not on any websites: hold both Ctrl keys for the current layout to be highlighter on the 1-4 keys. Tap Win with the Ctrls held down to change layout. You'll need the app to see what each layout is.\n\n\n\nIf you want to use the Fn layer with one hand (say when drinking with the other) you can tap both Alt keys to make the Fn layer the default, and the standard layer now becomes the new Fn layer. Tap the Alts to undo.
Don't listen to TheMagickConch - you have it under control! Just keep it like that... try not to think of those extra dense, better sounding PBT caps. Don't imagine the extra sensory pleasure you would have every time you use your keyboard.
Your Miami has leaked up the cable and corrupted your screen.
Well my first ever keycap purchase was... a single red Esc key. Now I feel like a part-time casual.
Look at this guy's channel: he gets a lot of shit for just selling food.
Can you tell us which parts you lubed? How much did you put on?
Can you PM me too? Or at least confirm that you will let us know through r/mechanicalkeyboards, since I rarely go to MechMarket?
When can we hear more? Price, switch availability?
That's the kind of artisan just crying out for a "boop" every time you tap its snout.
Exactly the same as me.
Same here.
Did the keyboard just find out that the next version will be made with Cherry ML switches?
Thanks for posting this. Although I already have a hot-swappable board (Teamwolf TKL) I was considering getting the Z-77 TKL as well. I had no idea they were not compatible with standard switches. \n\n\n\nCheers.
Time? What year was Carbon?
It feels like I 've been waiting for this for *soooo* long. It's getting closer and closer though...
I think a lot of us who bought our Anne Pros in the Banggood sale lose sight of the fact that they are usually more expensive than we remember.
> The Type S is slightly more tactile feeling but that might just be the ages of when I lubed the sliders. \n\nCould that be because the Novatouch stems are not extended to accomodate the hyperspheres, as the Type-S is? This would stop the domes from fully standing and slightly lessen tactility.
>  Lube them if you believe the hype.\n\nLubed stabs are real. The lubed sounds are untouchable. So sayeth I.
~~There is also [this](http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/realforce-88ub-45g-key-black-on-black-mini-keyboards.asp) TKL version in ISO.~~ It's unfortunate they don't do the white one in ISO.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry, they have sold out of these now.
Yes, I rebooted after typing in those very commands. No change in the version. Not sure if I should just open Synaptic and uninstall everything with the 17 RC3 version number.
You don't happen to enjoy photography as a hobby, do you? ;)
Shots fired, shots fired!
They use Topre stems, so you will need to find Topre compatible keycaps. I don't think Tai-Hao have any Topre sets.
I think I had that once when mine was new. If you haven't already set up lots of custom Fn layer bindings - use the reset button on hte bottom of the keyboard.\n\n\n\nAlso, don't have the keyboard plugged in if you're connecting to your phone over Bluetooth.
Is it just the lighting, or is the 88 key TKL a floating-key board? The 69 key has traditionally recessed keys, right?
Except the Ergodox stuff, I think. But all the extra keys ans ISO support is included.
I misunderstood that question. If the "Fn+Shift+1" is just to trigger "Shift+F1" then yes, the Anne Pro can do that. Make sure you press shift first though. For a while I thought there was something wrong with my Anne Pro due to some combinations not working: turns out I was holding Shift as the second key instead of the first.
As always with the Anne Pro, jam in the reset button on the underside of the board and switch off Bluetooth. Then try it.
Yes, the answer is yes.
Yes... yes. Build this.
Although I don't have numbers for you, lithium batteries do not extend their lives by emptying before recharge - quite the opposite. Most lithium ion/polymer batteries are expecting regular top ups.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't worry about it.
Keep checking [Banggood](http://www.banggood.com) every now and then. They have them less regularly than AliExpress, but Im sure I've seen them crop up occasionally.
Looking sharp.
Exactly as you say: I match my thinest ABS set with my lightest switches. The feel isn't premium, but it's a damn sight better than putting them on any other switch.
Probably very linear. I hear that professional typists (e.g. Stenographers) like having lighter actuation for their keyboards.
Right? After coming back to a TKL from a programmable 60% I'm constantly trying to go to the function layer and use IJKL as arrow keys. I'm also re-aquainting myself with the Nav cluster.
You *don't* like something I've been waiting months for? You're a monster.
You should have left off the last sentence ;)
Sorry, if something is damaged then we're a bit beyond my electronic skills.
I know this is a render, but does that keyboards exist? You know, with the extra button on the function row?
Are Gat Browns bottoming-out at 55g, or is that the actuation force? I know that Gateron makes Zealios, so I would assume it's bottom out force, but I want to be sure.
There's no need for language like that.
thidjdiejcnsjs;wicncnje  \nwww wvififj \n\n\n\nfthusjs\n\nsssssssaaaaaa\n\n\n\nYup!
And now they're mass-produced for $3.50. Can you imagine the post-hoc rationalisational hoops that person is jumping through to justify their purchase?
Make sure you're not blocking ads on Reddit. That's how I found out about Banggood running a sale of new Anne Pros a few weeks ago. I bagged myself one with Gateron Browns, but they sold out very shortly after.\n\n\n\nYou could also check with Aliexpress - they sell the cases for the Anne Pro, so I can only assume that aat some point they sold the actual board.\n\n\n\nFailing that, eBay might have some.
I'm afraid I haven't had a chance to take a sound recording yet - you would think this would have occured to me early on.\n\n\n\n\nI thought I'd include a few pics of my recently arrived Anne Pro to show a technique I've used before to change the sound of the key presses. I would say, though, that lubing your stabilizers and the top-out areas of the switch housing will make the biggest difference. Maybe I'll make a post sometime about the other board I did this on, since it makes Zealios sound very nice.\n\n\n\n\nThis Anne Pro was purchased in the most recent Banggood Anne Pro sale, to which I also added a discount code, getting it for around £58. I chose Gateron brown switches, ~~though I was tempted to try their black switches.~~ from a choice of browns blues and reds.
Fear not, the [8-bit guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7vXMezW_I) has a solution for you if it ever does happen.\n\n

Bought a set of Cherry 1800 doubleshots from /u/peanutbuttermuncher 
Hey dude\nIt's very close from memory - they are very very dark purple.\n
plz add me to the waiting list :)
Ultimately my problem is with the i3 setup getting messed up between 12 and 13 with the same config file - that's why I asked here. 
Good to know. Without giving things away that you're (I assume) not allowed to, how much time do you think you'd add to that 50 minute estimate to get the proper equipment?
This is important for phones that actually have a front flash, like the Moto Z. Good stuff, Google.
Not at all my dude. I'm waiting for some new series, and while BOTW looks perfect for me, I don't have my Switch yet and want to avoid spoilers. Such is life, I guess.
Were you looking for Tux, or a distro-specific key? Either way, you can get it custom, but the Tux is a little overdone IMO.
If you don't bottom out hard, you'll be on par to the MacBooks bottoming out around you, maybe a little louder.
I think that's what I had done before.
MX Nature Whites, but made by Gateron and super smooth.
That's what I believe had happened in the past, as well. It's fixed now, though, as I built i3-gaps from source.
r/fountainpens ?
I think perhaps people tend to get those caps for Red Scarf boards? I wasn't sure, either.
I've used a Model M before (though not plugged into anything, as it was a terminal model), and I liked it =)\n\nThe only issue is, SSKs are expensive, and I have bad wrists, so I can't really use a fullsize.
I'm not sure if you meant console hacking, or if counter-hacking is a thing? Either way, I don't think anything will chance, since they use different systems for game purchase and online, and they don't have any cross-generational releases to force 3DS updates.
What board is that up top?
There are Club Penguin private servers, so if they have ban rules, I'd imagine that would be a prevalent category.
Side note: if there's any logs or other info you need to help me, I'm happy to provide it. I just don't want to do the update again unless I know it'll be safe. Even if I have to change syntax in my config, that's fine, I just want to know what to change.
Not to be *that person*, but it'd be MX Blue key*switches*, not key*caps*. Just so ya know =)
Ah, okay, thanks
I had downgraded back to the previous version of i3-gaps before, and then today I upgraded to the new i3-gaps by building it from source from Airblader's GitHub. 
Ease of use or brick risks aside, what *can't* we do that would be useful? As far as I'm concerned, it's all conveniences (apart from being able to use a GCN controller in vWii games, which I would love for Smash)
Ah, okay. That's good to know for if I ever start getting better than the people at my school (but they play a lot more than I do, so it's unlikely, which is fine with me)\n\nI've definitely had little tastes of the cool combos and elaborate setups, and it is really fun.
Practically speaking, you can just plug it in over USB to make sure it's charged, and keep it connected over Bluetooth.
I'll update my i3-gaps and hope for the best. Thanks!
Thanks! ^^ ^- ^^
Use the Elgato Game Capture HD (not the HD60). The PS3 blocks capture over HDMI, but the Elgato HD has a special cable for the PS3 that comes with it.
That'd be nice, because then we could just find the fastest way to do it with minimal equipment.
Alright, thanks =)
Ooh, cool. I've gotta practice z-dropping them at the right times when I get the chance, I can definitely see that leading into more damage. Right now I mostly just play for stage control with the hydrant, but I'm not great when I get to ledges. Seems I've got some stuff to think about =)
I made this video as a Computerphile-esque explanation of how buying, owning, and receiving WiiU games works. It is not an endorsement of piracy, but this does include an explanation (without details/methods) of how it works. I hadn't seen a video like this, and I love this style, so I hope someone else enjoys it!
I'd suggest something with Cherry MX Red switches, then. If you want a really solid, full size board, then my suggestions would be the Leopold FC980M or the Ducky One. Both fit into your price range from MechanicalKeyboards.com.
That HKP blank is a favorite of mine, I've got one on my v60 =)
Yeah, they've been looking for it.

No, I definitely get the reason it was posted here. I just like to point out when something appears at first glance as though it came from a different sub than it's in.
You know what, I had forgotten about Fire Emblem. I don't think an indie game would push an update, though, and Fire Emblem is only the one game so far between the two consoles.
It's Halo Wars 2, so it's a very recent game (might even still be in beta?)\n\nStill, though, it would be funny if there was thought put in.
I just updated i3-gaps from source and it worked just fine.
It wasn't loading my config properly, leading to basically default i3 with my rofi for alt+d being all white and my windows not having gaps. Not fun. Works now, though!
As in, no new games are coming out for both platforms. So, a new Switch release couldn't come to 3DS with a new update/fix for exploits.
I'm glad some people from here liked my video =)
Thanks for the input =)
It's funny - to be honest, I skipped out on disc games for the most part in my WiiU adventures, so I never thought about that. Thanks for the info =)
Well wait, did they find the title key? I don't use 4chan so I haven't been keeping up with the thread.
I think people want to play it because of the old Game Grumps series. That's the only reason it's on my radar, and I've heard similar from others.
Oh wow, it's really that simple? Looks like I need some "man pacman" in my life, haha
The 100g in some gat Browns would be great for your use. =)
Ah, okay. I have limited macOS/OSX experience, but I really like the way the colors/Ui elements are layered and put together in Sierra and iOS 10 as opposed to the old way.
I think Maxkeyboards would do a good job with that. Their custom backlit 1.25u keys are sub-10 USD.
Cool, sounds good! I've been slowly learning to use the various fruits better at the right times, so knowing that it's part of a good strategy is nice. Thanks for the input ^^ ^- ^^
Why not Sierra? (Or do you have to get El Capitan first?)
Alright, thanks. I have a vague idea what blobs are, but my friend isn't interested in jailbreak/modification stuff, so he doesn't have them. Based on past experiences, does it seem like there will ever be an exploit for 10.2.1+, or is it pretty out of the question? (From WiiU/3DS hacking, I know some changes are hard to overcome for exploit devs)
Do you have the newest version of LiveSplit? I use an older version and never have that issue, regardless of Internet connection status. (Though I've only been offline a few times with LS open)
WiiU VC is accepted on Speedrun.com for OOT. You should be good.
Cool pants, cool set!
Essentially, what makes a mechanical keyboard different from a "normal" one is the fact that each key has its own "switch." The swtich is the mechanism, topped with the keycap (the part you press), which you press on to register the key. The switch is made up of multiple parts, all of which work together to do two things: achieve a certain, predictable feel, and send keypresses to the computer. Cherry is a German company which makes a line of switches called MX, the most popular brand used in mechanical boards. The brand's switches are identified by the color of the *stem* (the part that the keycap fits on to).\n\nCherry MX Red switches are linear (meaning there is no artificial tactile feedback during the press) and fairly light (meaning the spring inside is not very hard to press down). Being linear, they are also *not* clicky (clicky meaning a switch that makes an extra noise upon pressing down).\n\nWhen you buy a keyboard, you have to decide what switches you want it to have. The Cherry MX Red switches seem to be what you're looking for.
Must really love cheese.
See, this is better than all those, "OMG I NAMED MY PAKOMAN AFTER THE FIRERED PLAYTHROUGH" posts. Gave me a good chuckle looking at Dantler's face, haha
Make a speedrun.com page for it, and post your runs and route. People will come if they're interested.
I didn't know Topre came that light - how is it?
Even though I don't necessarily see it blowing up, kik's 50 person limit seems... Limiting, I guess, for a public discussion community. 
Man, those old boards are where it's AT. *ba dum tsss*
Thanks! I ended up using --ignore, but it's good to know I have a permanent option, too. =)
What would constitute this? Would that mean, for example: package *x* depends on i3 version *b*, but I'm on i3 version *a*. Would that then also break package *x* if I stay on i3 version *a*? (Yay, variables) 
I'll try that, thanks.
Thanks, yo! I came up with it back when I actually got redNAND (before Brazilian Method and Mocha) and I'm pretty sure I'll never change it.
This seems like an obvious thing, but have you dropped the board, kept in a hot/cold environment, or otherwise put it in adverse conditions recently?\n\nRegardless of the answer, taking off the cane and checking out the solder points could give you a cause.
Is this a GG reference that I don't know, or is it just in the style of some other things they've said?
If you have a smartphone, get Translate on it and use the visual translation with the camera.
No problem!\n\nAnd while I'm at it, you tag people on Reddit with /u/kotikii (or whatever their name is, obviously)

Endgame is like a mathematical limit - as you get more boards, you get ever closer, but never reach it.\n\nThat said, I hope you love it!
That TADA is really nice. Good stuff!
I think that would only be possible if someone were to make a replacement system settings application with theme support.
When they say "floating keycap", it's not a feature of the caps, but rather the way that the switches are mounted. What that means for you is that you can put any caps on there that you'd like, and they'll be "floating", too. =) 
Is that a Dactyl? (I try to keep up with these cool ergonomic builds but there's so many variations)
Hey, we have the same Jelly Key ^^ ^- ^^\n\nGreat board!
Ooh, that sounds amazing! Especially because I love the click of my Blues. Thank you!
Well, not exactly. He says endagme position of no return, but that doesn't mean he has the equipment/stats/strats to actually beat the end of the game. We don't know if it's beatable in that time. Post title is misleading (potentially)
Hasn't this feature been a part/planned part of Remix OS since its inception?
I'm not experienced with wiring, but I do know that it'd be a good idea to open up the case and look at which keys are connected on the PCB. The fact that there are membrane *and* mechanical keys affected makes me think there's an issue in part of the connection below.
This has nothing to do with the Game Grumps, really. They just happen to be playing BOTW, like everyone else is.
Plastic To Buy, obviously.
So true. There have been *too many* times that I've explained form factors to people who have never spent more than 10 dollars on a keyboard.
If you do, make sure to post pictures/your experience right here with all of us! <3
[semi-relevant xkcd?](https://xkcd.com/1172/)
The calculator button is, like 99% of the time, not present on mechanical boards by default, unfortunately. Other than that, there are a few things to ask:\n\nHow often do you use the number pad/tenkey?\n\nHow often do you use your arrow keys/home/end/PgUp/PgDn?\n\nHow much tactile feedback would there ideally be in your ideal keyboard? (1-10, where 1 is nothing and 10 is metaphorically punching your fingers back)\n\nHow loud would your ideal keyboard be? (1-10, where 1 is a cheapo keyboard an 10 is a typewriter)\n\nWhat's your budget? (Just know that it's not uncommon for good boards to cost over 100 USD.)
Right? I really want a 60% with Nature Whites, but I'm afraid they'd be too scratchy *and* they're still manufacturer exclusive to Ducky afaik. Would be so happy to have Gaterons like them.
I came in with the Droid 2 when it was already a year old, but I remember all the times I had to rely on 3G to do something important while my D2G began to die in my hands at school.\n\nThose were... fun? 
Go for it, it's a great board!
Since I don't have an HDD I'd use for it, I guess I'm good, haha
Textra devs have said they will implement RCS support as needed, so hey.
There very well may be, but I haven't used any others. The Elgato has treated me well, and works on Mac and Linux. It's surely not the only option, though.
I would want a smoother, lubed, Gateron equivalent to MX Nature Whites. Haven't used that, though (nor do I think it's ever been cobbled together by anyone), so the best I've used is MX Clears. (For now)
Yeah, meant that. Editing the survey. Thanks!
Cherry master race.
Favorite in what way? SA is my favorite aesthetically, DSA is my favorite to use (only because I have yet to actually own and type on an SA set).\n\nWish I'd had the money to get in on either of the two XDA sets that have come out. I'm looking forward to seeing more XDA and getting my fingers on some.
Yessir
I'm still unable to select two profiles :/
I like Cherry because of colors, SA because it looks really nice, DSA because it's great to type on, and Topre because fuck yeah 660c stock caps.
You might want to add the ability to select multiple options.  Unless you're asking what our favorite profile is.  
Thanks! Let me add that as an option. (btw, you can edit your response afterwards)
Will do. Thanks!
currently my favorite is DSA, but I'm really looking forward to XDA.
Use? OEM\n\nWANT to use? SA\n\nFFS, when will a new sale start?

"We offer a 1 year replacement warranty on all our UV printed keycaps."\n\nThat's what the WASD website says, if you're that heavy of a typist you may run through your first set and the replacement set quickly.

I've been thinking about buying a fixed gear bike, mostly because a complete one seems to be cheaper and higher quality than a bike with many gears.\n\nWhy have a fixed gear over a free wheel? Assuming I have breaks on the bike, what are the benefits to having a fixed gear?
Fried rice. Pork, chicken, steak, doesn't matter. White rice + sauce + meat + veggies. All in a pan. Cheap, quick, clean, and delicious!

I used to talk to my best friend on there. He wasn't a "cool" kid in my class so we couldn't really talk in school, so we talked on the Toboggan server.\n\nWe are still friends today and I still feel bad about not being nicer in school 
From the photo they didn't look rough, so I didn't think they were PBT. I've been in the market for a nice blank sculpted keyset!
I *love* my mechanical keyboard. I've had it for a few months and it's amazing. \n\nBut of course I need another one. This one:\n\n1) I'd like to build it myself (PCB build preferably)\n\n2) 40% (or MiniVan similar with arrowkeys) layout\n\n3) Staggered layout, because I'm scared of switching to Ortholinear after just teaching myself to touch type on staggered\n\n4) I do not anything about programming. I don't feel confident in my ability to program a layout. So I'd like to be able to get full functionality out of the keyboard on Mac OSX without having to do any programming. 
I'd love to play Magic there! I've heard the legacy community is strong!
They're probably WASD customs
You've found toxic legacy players? Where are you from?
I had this problem with a couple of my keys. The problem for me was the little white costar stabilizers were seated too far into the keycap, so they didn't slide properly on the wire.\n\nIf you put a little plastic wrap or scotch tape on the white plastic costar stabilizer, then put it in the keycap, you might have more luck.\n\nOn mobile now, but if you look at my post history you can find the post I made about it. I have a video of what my problem was.
Love the caps! Good luck with your move
If you're a medium weight typist they'll last a reasonable amount of time for a reasonably priced set of keycaps. The price point is fair for what they offer, complete customizability. Which isn't offered anywhere else.\n\nThey also have a warranty on their keycaps, I believe it's a one year replacement guarantee.
I was happy with my pulls from the raffle too! But that gold bag looks insane! Congrats

So are these Panda switches completely linear? Or does it take more Force to bottom out than in takes to actuate?
Looks awesome! What kind of keycaps are those? They look so smooth
*have a seat*\n\nMechanical keyboards are computer keyboards with switches under the keycaps rather than mushy fragile rubber domes. There are numerous types of switches to suit your needs (clicks, tactile, and linear). They're very customizable, and you could even build your own! 
Here's hoping the hate filled Imgur crowd sees this!
Are there any pictures of the yellow and pink versions?
It's a custom template. You can download the file and edit it.
Gorgeous. Love it. Anyone know the official name of the rainbow one?
Most mainstream keyboard options are membrane keyboards, meaning a mushy rubber contact is trying to do the job of providing feedback for your finger and registering a keystroke. Mechanical keyboards use individual switches soldered to a PCB board. Each switch has a keycap on it. These switches do not need to be pressed all the way to the bottom to register a keystroke. Also, they are returned to their original position by a spring rather than a deteriorating piece of rubber. There are numerous types of switches, some that will provide actual tactile feedback you can feel when you actuate the switch, some are clicks and produce a click when they are actuated, and some are linear and have a smooth transition from top to bottom. The keyboards are completely customizable too! 
Nice! I'll probably get that, I'm looking to get a Planck kit! 
I will! I wish more people were interested in other's passions like you are. It would make the world a more interesting place if everyone was able to share their expertise on a subject!
Yes usually, because most switch brands guarantee their switches for upwards of 50 million activations! 
Is the yellow one a lemon or was it from this raffle?

They're G20s. The profile is only slightly lower than the alphas. Personally I don't like the look of DSAs when they're bigger than 1u.
What kit did you get to practice?
Unfortunately, I think this is exclusive to "casual" formats.\n\nI play only legacy now because legacy players are typically more committed and better at the game than casual players.

Try using [Prime 95](http://www.mersenne.org/download/).  It's not unusual for it to get really hot while running this, but if it crashes a lot then you have a overheating problem. (NOTE: Prime95 can damage hardware. Use at your own risk!)\n\nE: Download SpeedFan and look at the temperatures. Also, run Unigine Heaven, to test for GPU overheating.
It doesn't need to include drives and it can probably be homebuilt. Thanks!

I've only ever seen the small round ones at hardware stores, but I'll give it a check. Thanks!
I am trying to find these specifically as they match the indents found in a lot of cases. I've gotten 2 or 3 cases that have these feet exactly. I would have just bought Bumpons if I needed any rubber feet.
I have seen those style at hardware stores before, thats why i reccomended it. But each one is differant so they might be tougher to find around you.
A hardwares store ( Home Depot, Lowes etc.) Will have cabinet bumpers that will work perfectly.
Huh I didn't know that. Awesome! I wonder where they're getting their trackpoints though. They are very hard to find.
I made a default config for the Bantam-44 and the dev of http://qmk.sized.io put it up as a preset. 
No, that switch just means older TVs need converter boxes which were given out for free. You just need a TV, an antenna, and a converter box if your TV doesn't have a digital tuner.

The project is cool, but the reason these boards are only found in DIY is because you can't get ahold of TrackPoints in large quantities. There was a company that sold them, but they only sell controllers now and not the actual pressure sensor. This is likely why the TEX Yoda stopped production. 
The city I was driving in is the roundabout capital of the US. Most people have no issue with them. A few still haven't gotten the memo. They really are a much better way to handle intersections for the most part though.

That crash test proves nothing. Crash safety isn't just about cabin intrusion. Change in velocity over time is very important as well. Notice how they cut off right before the Smart bounces backwards? That kind of change in speed is not good for the soft meatbags inside.

What I ended up doing is kind of similiar. I upload files to my user account via FTP and then run a script to copy them over to the Apache root, change ownership, and set the proper permissions.\n\n    cp -a /home/n0bs/http/. /srv/http/\n    chown root:root /srv/http\n    chown -R root:root /srv/http\n    chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= /srv/http\n    chmod -R  u=rwx,g=rx,o= /srv/http\n    setfacl -m "u:http:r-x" /srv/http\n    setfacl -Rm "u:http:r-x" /srv/http\n\nIt works but it seems quite clunky. I'm curios as to how it's managed on shared web hosting services. Uploading via FTP to the proper web server folder doesn't require setting permissions manually.

Using something like a Rubber Ducky is extremely easy. There are all sorts of scripts out there that you can just load onto its memory.  Most of them have a Micro SD slot that you load a script onto and it'll run the script automatically when it gets plugged in. No microcontroller experience needed.

So people shouldn't copy you, but you copying Ethan Schoonover is fine? I'm guessing you asked him for permission then? And why do you claim control over his theme when it comes to keycaps?

This is why I think more people should take emergency driving courses or participate in a few autocross events. Obviously you should always leave more than enough space for the conditions, but a lot of this swerving stuff happens because people don't know the limits of their cars. Cars can stop surprisingly quickly, but people are often too soft on the brakes. Yes it's uncomfortable and it feels like you're going to break something, but cars can take a lot of abuse when it comes to tight turns and hard braking.
Not backing up to an online service is a security feature. Your auth codes should only ever be on that one device. That's why the backup codes exist.
If it's not permanent, it's called ghosting. It's common on certain IPS displays.

Current networking protocols can be made extremely secure. The problem isn't the tech, it's the people. Even if the network is set up correctly (which it's often not), there's still the large risk of people leaking sensitive information that can lead to a network breach.

So you expected to own the movie? You do know that ownership of the movie would entail full rights to distribution and modification, right? Of course you don't own the movie. With any form of media you purchase, you purchase specific rights. These rights are what is considered normal use for a consumer. You can watch it whenever you want, you can make personal copies, but that's all you can do. Anything further encroaches on the rights of the original creator and/or whoever he sold full rights to.

Yea, ive ridden a 27.5 Freeride bike and its a huge change from what im used to. To be fair it was almost 8lbs lighter and had rear lock-outs which made pedaling not suck.
In my experience 1 core at 5 is often good enough to see 4 at around 4.8. With that (aweful) extrapolation, we can hope for 4.6-4.7 with some level of comfort. Its usually the last .1 thats the hardest.
Thats what i meant, i understand how it could have come off badly. Im a linear whore so im not the best person to ask about any other switch.

You might be better off to look at something a bit more custom or exotic with gateron reds or blacks. They are way smoother and much nicer.\n\nThe other thing you might want to look at is a nicer mx board like a coolermaster or ducky. Much stiffer plate, better built, and often a better price.

No, they dont have 5 points. But a basic belt will still keep you roughly in the right place. Atleast until most of the rolling is done.
To add to that, make sure you dont get water-based clearcoat if you are using the paper-y stickers as it could soak in and cause issues.
I think ceramic? I just asked the guys in flooring if they had any broken ones or singles i could buy and he gave it to me.
I have no fugus, but they are one of the most popular caps for sure. I think one of the things we can get better at is not berating people for how they spend their money and what they do with their property after they have spent it. If someone wants to flip a cap and you dont like it, either ignore them, or take it up with them privately or atleast in a civil fashion. (Giveaway wins are a differant story though)

First off, very happy to see the gains you guys have made with the Ryzen platform. My question is; do you have any expectation of a new arch from your competitiors to try to regain the distance they had for a few years? 
I hope these prices are real, because even counting conversion and retail markup, this would force intel to get of their asses and actually do something.

Using steam, create a second steam library if you are going to install games on your C drive. Install games there rather than default, that way if you have to reinstall steam, you just have to repoint it to the folder instead of redownloading everything.
Even better, create a second library folder on the ssd so any games you install there dont get deleted if you have to reinstall steam.
They were just listed in the same statement as speeds and reds which are linear so i can see where people could have been confused.

Thanks for the tip! I'll have to look into it. I think USPS has a list of items that need special attention when shipped internationally but I haven't gotten a chance to look at it yet. If this ends up being a problem then might have to limit this buy to the CONUS.

I'm potentially interested in two orders, but I am in Australia. Would that be an issue for you?
I'd be interested as well! Keep us posted!
Ha! Does that mean I should count you as interested?
I definitely looked into it.  Buying directly from the manufacturer means spending more for small quantities or buying much more than you need.  I looked at McMaster-Carr and Ratermann (2 of the larger US distributors) and both are well over $16 per oz excluding shipping, even in large quantities.  If you know another way to get a small quantity for a reasonable price (link/contact info?) I'd certainly be interested.  \n\nHaven't decided yet if the savings is worth the time/effort involved.  On one hand I like getting a good deal and learning to do it myself.  On the other hand it takes effort to organize deal with orders, etc.  I figured I'd see what the interest is like and go from there.
Definitely interested myself. I just ordered soldering equipment a few days ago so I can start properly customizing my boards & make some customs.

Wow, $60 is a good price for the barebones keyboard, especially with RGB and hotswap capabilities. I don't own anything backlit right now but that may change when the TKL version is released.\n\nAlso, its pretty cool that your store is the only one to stock the SMD compatible Gaterons. 
They are still a 1 seed in my mind. This loss only confirms the fact that they will surely not get the number one overall seed.

I bought a planck kit and didn't get the two pictured ESC keys. I did get kind of lucky because they were already included in the base kit. 
Your build-logs are always world class, great boards and even better pictures. Makes me sad that mine still isn't put together. 
You start with QFR, then it's a frosty flake controller upgrade, next things are a fancy keycap set and an aluminum case that each cost double what you paid for the original board. \n\nGreat choice, enjoy it and don't get too sucked in! 
Yeah, Originative has had past issues and I can understand people refusing to order from them because of that. \n\nThey are a business, they aren't looking to run everything at or below a zero profit line. When they are putting up 100k+ to have a set ready to ship from the storefront, they are going to add a price premium. I would much rather support a groupbuy run through Originative than MassDrop. \n\nEdit: Just joined their GB for screw-in Cherry stabilizers. 
☹ Good Luck! 
I think the SkiData set is a much safer bet. Can't really mess up the dark grey and orange keys from the sampler pack looked fine.

Nah it's just for SKCL Green, with one of my Zenith boards being click-modded. Had to opportunity to buy an SKCM Green Docutech for ~$130 way back when I was first getting into Alps but didn't think much of it. Oh well, they are overrated anyway especially the ones with bamboo tops. \n\nWeren't even that 'valuable' of a switch until ChucklingKumquat was willing to $8 each.

Jehovah's witness protection program.  
Not quite, but they do hold in very strong, especially when soldered in. 
Switch compatibility is not as much of an issue as stabilizers. The unfortunate thing about alps is that you often have to plan the entire build around the keycaps. 
IIRC it doesn't have air conditioning either. 
RGB backlighting is not ~~that~~ the same as RGB underglow.

ANSI Modding in the future? 
According to the [Cherry date code](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_date_codes) on the labels,  they were manufactured in 1995 but the switches could be a little bit older. 
SP doesn't really give a shit the enthusiast market, we are just a passing fad to them, hence why they haven't upgraded their SA production capacity. Bunny likely didn't give anyone else permission to run the set because Originative was already gearing up for R2, same goes for that GMK Penumbra debacle. \n\nPeople here were paying $350 for GMK Hyperfuse and complaining about availability but when the 500 sets were put up on Originative's storefront they took weeks to sell out. Everyone wants it until they have to cough up the cash. \n\nSorry you or anyone else didn't get in on the exclusivity, but that is too damn bad. Not everything is fair. I am tired of seeing you and all the snowflakes around here bash BunnyLake when you can't get your way. \n
Did you guys know his dad, Rick Barry shot underhand too??? 
Looks like three 1.25u keys on the left, a 6.25u spacebar then two 1.5u keys on the right. Pretty common bottom row on 65% and 75% boards so any aftermarket keyset worth it's salt will have support. 
In the Geekhack interest check, the [ergodox kit had a 2.75u spacebar for the VE.A and other split-space keyboards](http://i.imgur.com/5YHqgf8.png), what gives? Hopefully there is a spacebar kit.
Which layout do you prefer, 96 key or CPSQ? 
Supports [pretty much everything](http://i.imgur.com/YS8mlID.png) besides 1.5u keys on the bottom row. Honestly though I'm disappointed as Skully went out of his way to accommodate Alps and backlighting but made the [Cluepad](https://clueboard.co/parts/clueboard-cluepad-pcb) so it supports only 2u keys.  Really wanted to put a set of NeXT caps on one of them. 
So its just going to be like a normal ASG until the last 5 minutes? 
Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATocBBd7ARs&user=ghastlytube).

You may just have to find a set of GMK Bluegaloo, [Purple](https://www.originativeco.com/products/purple-modifiers), or [Magenta](https://www.originativeco.com/products/magenta-mods) for the mods but they won't cover more than a 75% board. \n\nHope that helps but distinguishing all these damn blues and purples is a nightmare for someone colorblind.

Go on...
I think we all can agree that regardless of the bad breaks, Bunny's resolution of past groupbuys have been left a bad  taste in the community's mouth. That said, all incomplete Penumbra orders and Hyperfuse replacement keys are with BroCaps, waiting (forever) to ship. \n\nMy point is that there is not as much of a demand for these colorways as much as everyone thinks. After Sophomore, BunnyLake hasn't run any groupbuys and has let other people deliver on Penumbra and Hyperfuse with GMK Penumbra on the way. Doesn't make sense for two people to run the same colorway at the same time. I bet if someone competent wanted to run GMK Toxic they could get easily get permission. \n

I think Varmilo is great especially since they have custom ordering but if are like me and prefer the more traditional Cherry font, the [GeekKeys](http://www.geekkeys.com/geekkeys-dark-grey-dyesub-thick-pbt-full-keyset/) set is also an option\n\nAlso, Varmilo's email contact is zhh19@zhihaihe.cn, Cindy was very helpful when I wanted to order a VA68m case. 
Your best bet is probably going to the [GeekKey's set](http://www.geekkeys.com/geekkeys-dark-grey-dyesub-thick-pbt-full-keyset/), the only things it lacks are Delete, End, and Pg in the proper profile so it will end up looking like [this](https://i.imgur.com/o2LCH2v.jpg). Also, in the linked picture the large "+" key on the numpad made into a 1u key but all these minor details can be changed with an [1800 kit](http://i.imgur.com/2zIcTV5.png).  \n\nI have the above GeekKeys set paired with a leftover 1800 kit from [Shadovved's GB](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=78563.0) and it is a perfect match.

The ability to remap keys and create function layers is a great feature.

I think it's a little high, but I think it cost more than you think.

Probably a low-ball estimate)\n* Zeal Stabs: $30\n* Zealios: $52.5 (for 70)\n* Springs: $12.5 (low-ball estimate)\n* Zealencios: $45\n* GeekKeys PBT: $40\n\nAll for a grand total of at least $470 before shipping. So, I believe OP, although whether or not it's a sane price is a completely different story.

Yes, the motherboard does support 3200 MHz ram. I underclocked it to 2133 MHz and it boots now. Does this just mean that I have to underclock it for it to work? I'm also running memtest86 right now, and there appear to be no errors (but I'll have to wait to know for sure).

Pictured is an SMK-101 B. Two versions, B and W (for black and white).

You can [swap](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nXvonog8TGQ) the top and bottom halves in the case. Its horrendous on the top, and the resistive trackpad is absolute garbage, so I recommend it.

This is one of my dream boards! I will get my hands on one some day. I hope to get everything working. My hope is that once enough folks in the community have them, reverse engineering will be a more surmountable task.
I think the gap in your logic is that you're comparing a Korean custom board with programmable Leeku PCB and CNC aluminum case to a mass-manufactured board, a budget version of the MK84.\n\nThere are higher associated development, manufacturing, and materials costs that go into custom boards like the TX-75, and custom parts are also more expensive in the small quantities that these boards are produced.\n\nKits are preferred by many, as they allow you the most options in customizing your build to your own taste. Look at it as a feature, as opposed to an inconvenience.\n

Hail Mary for the grab bag. If whoever buys this doesn't need it, I'll buy it off them. GLWS!
This should have a [META] tag in the title.
It seems that tactile stems deform the switch contacts more through use/over time than linear stems. I imagine that this is because the contact metals flex twice per upstroke and downstroke instead of once per with a linear stem. I suppose then it could be possible that if the keypress event is more violent, with a sudden drop in force, as with a clicky switch, it could cause the contacts to fatigue even more.\n\nMost of this is speculation, feel free to deconstruct.
Mind if I do a jay?
You are correct. The insert surface is rough, and they are looser in the housings. They're not too bad if you heavily lube them, but the difference is definitely noticeable, and I think it's worth getting genuine Cherry stabs.

You may be able to get away with desoldering about half your switches. A bit finicky, depending on PCB flexibility. Harder to get them out than in. Works with SS plates, but your alu plate might bend.

It took me about 30-40 minutes. I'm sure I could have done it quicker, I had a lot of distractions lol. I've never removed sliders from a topre board, and I was a little hesitant.  I read that I may spend some time dealing with the notch on the sliders. I ended up prying them out from the underside of the housing on the opposite end of the notch. It worked flawlessly, no damage to the sliders. It was also very quick. I did 1 row at a time, pulling out the whole row, installing the hyperspheres, and reinstalling all the sliders.

It feels great! It definitely makes the board feel a lot more solid. A lot of the complaints I seen on reviews of the board are resolved. It gives the board the "thock" I was looking for.

I can't compare to a stock silenced board obviously, but this thing is easily the most quiet board I've ever owned.

Depends on your preference, there are quite a few options with that budget. Personally I'd spend a little more and get a iKBC MF108. Its a full aluminum case with PBT keycaps, which is a great deal at that price point. If a tenkeyless is more your style they should be releasing the  IKBC MF87. If you want a smaller 60% then pok3r would be the way to go. Welcome to our hobby, may god have mercy on your wallet.

You really should try hyperspheres on the RGB. Its a night and day difference.
Yes correct, there is a post on GH regarding the mod. Basically you just cut of a very small amount off the top. It isnt 100% necessary if you don't feel comfortable, but I would/have done it. It makes the keys rebound slightly better. Hypersphere is selling a new set for the Realforce RGB (111). When I ordered them though, 111 wasn't offered, so I wen't with 90+26.
My favorite color way is the endosphere. It has split personalities like my wife.

Especially in an open space, debugging at someone else's computer is quite common. I keep an extra rubber dome n hand for just such occasions.
Rather than trying to stick on tiny pieces of electrical tape, I wonder if it would be easier to paint on some sort of rubber coating or glue?\n\nSomething like this might work:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CJ5EO2E/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_ymoJybXXP36M4
Not sure about "superior in [every] way". I have boards with MX and Gateron browns and while I prefer Gateron switches for their smoothness they do wobble a bit more. \n\n+1 for Magicforce 68 though. Nice board for the price. 
I use a WASD CODE v2 104 as my daily driver.  It was my first mech and it definitely feels like a high quality board.  +1 to what others have said about the keycaps - they're okay but not great.  I upgraded to a backlit PBT set I found on ebay for $18 and it was a big improvement.  I don't know if there is a barebones option for the CODE product line but if so I might have gone for that instead.\n\nThe only other issue I've had with the board is ping, which is common to larger boards with a metal backplate.  I added some shelf liner to the case, O-rings, and a mouse pad underneath and now it's barely detectable (and a lot quieter in general \\^_\\^).
+1 to open sourcing the firmware.  I for one would definitely submit some pull requests.
Don't have any experience here so I looked around for what other people use.\n\nI thought GPL 100 was what I saw people using on GeekHack, but I can't seem to find a good link right now.  I do find several mentions of 103/104 so maybe that is the way to go.  TechKeys uses GPL 206 grease and 1506 oil.  Likewise the ZealPC "GH V4" lube is GPL 206 / VPF 1506.\n\nWould people rather have 206/1506?  I can look into that, but it will obviously affect the price.
Recently ordered the same keyboard from Banggood on black friday.  It took almost a month to arrive.  Overseas items take longer due to customs and stuff.  I would give it another week or two.
Yeah, I thought GPL 100 was the recommendation but I might be mistaken.  I do see some mentions of 103/104 in other forums.  I think I'll look into 206/1506 which is what TechKeys and ZealPC sell.
Yeah, I've heard you can make it go a lot further if you are conservative.  Honestly I've never used the stuff because it's so cost prohibitive so I can't say from personal experience how good the 110 switch claim is.  1 oz is surely well above what any sane person would need, for only a few dollars more than TechKeys.  I would consider doing smaller quantities but honestly it would be way too much logistic work for me.
I was concerned about how clean the cutout would look so I actually put mine on the bottom of the case.  My filing job was pretty bad, so I'm glad that I did :)
FYI all - I decided to go with a different mix more similar to TechKeys/ZealPC, so I made a new post.  You can check out the latest here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5xqh4h/gb_interest_check_krytox_gpl_206_vpf_1506_switch/\n
I didn't find a proper tutorial (though there are some good tips on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/5iixk5/adding_a_power_switch/)).  \n\nHere's a description of the process I used ...\n\n\n# Tools and Materials:\n\n* A simple slider switch (like [this one](https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-30vdc-0-5a-spst-sub-mini-slide-switch-2-pack))\n* Extra wire\n* Soldering iron\n* Solder\n* Shrink tubing or electrical tape\n* Hot glue gun\n* Electric drill\n* Small file (I used a the one on a nail clipper)\n* Tweezers or a small screwdriver\n\n# Steps:\n\n1. Remove the top plate from the case by removing the 5 screws in [these locations](http://imgur.com/a/Wr2gz)\n2. Remove battery from PCB by disconnecting the cable\n3. Snip the positive (red) wire to the battery and strip the ends\n4. Use extra wire and shrink tubing to extend the length (so it can reach the location where you want to put the switch)\n5. Drill a hole in the case slightly smaller than the switch.  The thread I linked above put the hole on the back of the case which seems to be a popular choice.  I actually put mine on the bottom of the case so it's more discrete.\n6. Use small nail file to shape the hole for the switch slider.  This was definitely the most time consuming part.\n7. Solder battery wires to the switch terminals\n8. Insert switch into hole and hold it in place with tweezers or a small screwdriver.  Apply hot glue to hold it in place.\n9. Reconnect battery to the PCB, verify bluetooth still works\n10. Reassemble
Nice build! What is the "bandaid mod" you did to your stabilizers?
I live on the northern US border pretty close to Canada.  So maybe?  PM me your postal code and I'll try to get an estimate.\n\n100/205 should work for all switches.  You just have to change the consistency (which is a big plus of having them separate).  I've heard a thinner consistency (more GPL 100) is better for linear switches while a thicker consistency (more GPL 205) is better for tactile switches.  \n\nFor stabilizers any thick lube will work.  You could use GPL 205 for this but it wouldn't be very economical.  I just use an inexpensive silicone grease like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFUPC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  Switchtop also sells [Super Lube](http://www.switchtop.com/product/super-lube-stabilizer-lube) specifically for stabilizers.  Both options are less than $5, compared to Krytox which is a premium switch lube.
Turning off LEDs helps with battery life but it still may send keystrokes if you travel with it in a backpack or whatnot. The only remedy is to disconnect the battery. A popular mod is to add a switch to the battery so you can do this without removing the case. I've done this to mine and it works great. 
+1 to battery level indicator
BOOO the Giants. I'm just jealous because my lowly A's haven't done anything in the past 10 years
I think [this](https://www.radioshack.com/products/pk2-slide-spdt-sw) is the switch I used (purchased from RadioShack).  Once mounted I found that the slider just barely clears the table so it worked out great.  Of course you could always file the slider down a little or get thicker rubber feet if you need more clearance.
+1.  Fix macros that were broken in v1.4
Macro recording is working for me but the key repeat behavior of macros seems pretty buggy.  I programmed a macro that maps Esc to Shift+backtick (to type '~' with fewer keystrokes) and probably about 50% of the time it ends up typing backtick or Esc.
Glad I could help!  Good luck.
PM me your postal code and I'll try to get an estimate.
Looks great!\n\n\nWhat angle is the incline at, if you don't mind me asking?
The ergodox is a fully programmable keyboard, meaning you can set whatever layout you want.  For the particular model of ergodox I have (infinity ergodox) there's an online configuration tool (https://input.club/configurator-ergodox) as well as the firmware on github.\n\n\nThe layers are sort of like a second layout that overrides the base configuration.  For example in the vanilla ergodox setup, layer 2 on the right hand transforms the ergodox into a numpad.  I really like this feature, because then I can make custom layers for different games I play, as well as for other uses (I've got a layer for programming as well). Hope that answers your question =)
Yeah I definitely like that I've got multiple locations to access the arrow keys from (wasd, hjkl, actual arrow cluster) so that no matter what I can just use the closest hand to scroll if need be.\n\n\nI also find it easier to hit the FN keys with two FN access locations - it actually lets me use all of them (F1-F12) one handed, which is nice.  Having the caps lock down by the space bar wasn't too bad of a change for me, since I don't use it too frequently (except maybe for typing out long constants).  The downside is that on other boards I keep hitting caps lock expecting it to be FN when it's not, so I end up internet shouting a lot by accident =D
Nah got an offer for the 65g. Was just mentioning that I had them too, would post if someone was interested. \n\nThanks for the heads up!
I did! =D
Confirmed
Woah looks nice! Where'd you get the purple enter key with cyan text on the top board?  I've been looking for something like that myself
You're welcome!  If you're on the fence I'd say go for it, because even if it ends up not being your cup of tea you can always re-sell it on r/mechmarket, ebay, or somewhere similar for a decent markup, since a lot of people are not completely comfortable with soldering their own switches, and are more than willing to pay a little bit more for that added convenience.\n\n\nPlus, it's really satisfying to build and customize to your personal preferences!
Alright, I'll remove the mention then.  Sorry for the trouble!
I was able to try a number of boards at a recent meetup with 62g switches, and found myself much preferring the slightly lighter feel on the bottom out of the 62g vs the 65g.\n\nIt's very subtle, but if you've been using your keyboard for long enough it starts to become a bit more apparent (especially over long periods of use, in my case).  I've also tried using cherry and gateron brown springs in zealios, and I still think I prefer the little bit of extra weight that the 62g springs provide.\n\nAnyway, it's all a lot of personal preference.  I'd probably be fine using 65g and sticking with that, but I figure that since I have a bunch of extra unused switches, I'd like to try out 62g in my board as well.\n\nHope that answers your question, or at least gives you some more insight.
Sure thing, load this [gist](https://gist.github.com/mr-lee/dce7e3fc80545e77a66db240bf4df73a) into the [configurator](https://input.club/configurator-ergodox)\n\n\nMy preferences are a bit weird since I'm left handed - so I actually ended up putting the y/h keys over on the left side.  It's still a work in progress, but let me know what you think!
Hmm interesting - I actually prefer my arrow keys to have a little bit of space around them - usually when I'm hunting for the arrow cluster I actually feel around for the open space around the "up" arrow when touchtyping with arrow keys.\n\n\nHere's an example of what I mean - on the current 60% layout I'm [using](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ce7bee443a9644a7a609dd7d9da34105).  Feedback on the layout is welcome, by the way!  It works really well for me, but like most things in this hobby, are very user dependent.\n\n\nAnother similar idea is the "Aria" layout of the [whitefox](https://input.club/whitefox/)\n\n\nI think I'm probably in the minority here (preferring space around the arrow keys), as I don't think I've seen very many layouts that leave intentional space for the arrow keys.
Haha, just the daily struggle and the pains of adjusting to normal schedules as someone who is perpetually semi-nocturnal. =)
Replied!
WASD V2 87 comes in Cherry MX Silents
Lucky you! It's such an amazing board and pretty much my endgame 65% because of the hotswapability and FN button integrated into the case. I got into the R2 GB and am waiting for feng to ship mine out.\n\nHow did you get yours?
May I present the [Totoro board](http://imgur.com/cY1ykkU)!  \n\n\nOne nice thing about ISO sets is that they come with a 1.25u shift key, which, if you have a set that does symbol mods like GMK cyan, works really well as an up arrow.  Since the menu key is nice and symmetrical, I just ended up using that as a proxy for the down arrow.\n\nThe best part about this layout is that it works on virtually all the existing 60% PCBs (in this case I'm using a GH60 SATAN) without any modifications.\n\n\nThe one drawback is if you're a user that likes right shift, then using this board may be a challenge.  However, if you're like me and don't really use it, this works amazingly well as a 60% with arrow keys.
>Hopefully OP will confirm.\n\nYup, got these out of my PMK grab bag yesterday!
PM sent
170\n\nThanks for doing this!
About the gap - I actually find it quite natural, since it's what I normally use to find my arrow keys on a standard TKL sized layout, especially when I'm touch typing.  Having the gap there makes it so that I wouldn't have to look down at all when using the arrow keys in that location.  So for me, it's a huge boon.\n\n\nI tried to make it fit aesthetically too, which is why it's symmetrical on both sides.
Thanks for organizing!
Oh it tells you what layer you're currently on.  The firmware is open source too, so you could change the display also to do whatever suits you fancy. =)
Can confirm, been using this board with gateron switches with no issues whatsoever.
PM Sent.
The one I'm using is one of the infinity ergodoxes from massdrop, but I've heard good things about the ergodoxes made by falbatech as well.
Will do.  Probably when it isn't some insane hour of the morning...\n\n\nSpeaking of which... How are you awake too? 0_0
Yup! I've been playing both FPS and action RPG games on it with no issue at all.  In fact I actually prefer it to my standard qwerty keyboard.\n\n\nSurprisingly I adjusted pretty quickly to the lack of stagger, and it actually feels a lot better than playing on my standard qwerty keyboard.  Another user pointed out that if the offset keys are weird, it's easy to move the direction keys one column to the right (on ESDF) and just add another programmed layer remapping the keys.  Makes it easier to reach the extra buttons on the thumb cluster, which are really nice to have.\n\n\nI really like being able to remap the keys in hardware, meaning I don't need to re-bind keys in software, and can switch back to qwerty if needed.\n\n\nI also really like the homing keycaps over WASD, makes it a lot easier to reposition my hand should I move it away for whatever reason.  I've been really happy with it so far!
The [Totoro board](http://imgur.com/cY1ykkU)!\n\n\nI used the ISO shift from GMK cyan for the up arrow, and the menu key as a proxy down arrow, since it's nice and symmetrical on GMK cyan.\n\n\nAs a side note, I really wish there was a better legend for this - it might work with a second ISO shift if you use a uniform profile like DSA, which I've been meaning to try out with this board.

I now have an unreasonable number of 'U', 'Y', '7', '8' '9', '0', '- _', and '+ =' keys, and almost none of the rest.  Thankfully this set is uniform row 3, so fun combinations can be made. =)
Yup my experience was pretty similar - I first tried the directional keys over the ESDF keys in the center of the pad, but found my personal preference to be over the WASD keys from all the muscle memory I've developed over the years.  I made a couple dedicated layers for different games (really helps with games with tons of buttons like MMO's) and I really think that's where the ergodox shines.\n
During his study abroad in China, one of my friends decided to teach any Chinese people he met there who wanted to learn English to conduct themselves in the following manner:\n\nTourist: Excuse me, how do I (insert generic question here)?\nChinese person: ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET (with heavy accented English)
Sounds like a great time =)\n\nNow if only I didn't have a meeting at 9AM...

I haven't heard a JB Rubber Rant yet this season
Yep, what you're looking for is a 75%. \n\nThe only one I know of that's readily available for commercial purchase is the Drevo Gramr or M84 but those don't come in Clears. \n\nAre you open to sourcing your own switches and soldering your own board?\n\n 
send nudez
Bought Granite Caps from /u/breckstar
Added
I don't believe you can add LEDs to the 980m. As for different switches, you're going to have to open up the case, desolder the current switches and solder in the ones you want.
I think the maximum thickness is 1.5mm anything thicker won't allow the switch to click in. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong
Anyone try Zealencios and MX Silents together? Is it noticeably quieter using both than one or another?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure feng is shipping them out in batches cause I haven't seen any V2s or SmartPads yet. Oh well, hopefully it'll show up soon.\n\nGreat looking board btw!
Told that to a girl once. Her reaction was pretty much the same as yours... \n\nI'm so lonely

Anyone know where to get authentic Plate Mounted Stabilizers? I know that Zeal carries them but want to see if there's any place cheaper
To me, J-Spaced blues have a bigger tactile bump than Zealios and the bump comes at a higher point. The travel distance is slightly decreased too.\n\nZealios are definitely smoother but I plan on  lubing my J-Spaced Blues at some point
No worries! Thanks for helping me look!
Gave away switches & stickers to /u/catlico
That's with the Numpad and ErgoDox kits and partial Tsangan kit though
Reading too fast! Nevermind!
Thanks! Hopefully mine gets delivered today!
Wat. This was 20 days ago. His 2nd 10-day ends today...
PM'd!
Can't use PCB Stabilizers with my incoming Smart68...
Gateron Tactile Clears are pretty equivalent
Thanks!
Gave GMK Red Esc to our new overlord /u/IneffableTao
Just a heads up that you can get 110 MOD-H switches on Originative for $80 plus shipping.
Both boards are pretty solid in terms of build quality. Since the KBParadise is in stock and $10 cheaper, I'd go for that.\n\nAs for Cherry Clear or Matias QC, if you plan on swapping out the keycaps, you're going to have an easier caps for Cherry switches
Pm'd
So according to https://github.com/kiibohd/pcb/tree/master/WhiteFox\n\nThe left pin of S6 connects to the left pin of S15 or S24. Can you try jumping the left pin of S6 to either one of those pins? 
Can you Jailhouse these?
Oh shit. I totally forgot about getting the lengths to you. I'll do this when I get home today. Sorry!!!
Looks like a combination of GMK HyperFuse (most of the alphas and modifiers) and GMK Skeletor (arrow keys and the purple Ctrl and Alt keys)
Replied
Sounds like an issue with the controller.\n\nDid you go through Massdrop? I would contact their support since I believe all MD drops come with a year warranty?
It's all about preference for layout size. I'm not a huge fan of 60% since I can't live without dedicated arrow keys. But like you said, all the keys are programmed under a function layer so they aren't 'missing'.\n\nIf you want a compact board with dedicated (programmable) PGUP and PGDN keys, you can take a look at the TADA68. They don't come in Clears unfortunately
~~Gateron clears are the exact opposite of Cherry Clears. They're linear with a 35g actuation point~~\n\nDisregard my comment. Thought you were talking about the Gateron clears!
What's with the recent influx of DSA HyperFuse up for trade/sale? Is there going to be another run soon?
If you can't find anyone on here, you can probably find a local phone repair shop to fix/replace the port.  I'm sure they fix a lot of phone ports so fixing yours shouldn't be too much of an issue for them
Nice! Be sure to post pictures when it arrives! And feel free to PM me any questions you might have
Do you see any burn marks on your PCB? 
Sure thing. If you're buying, always pay through PayPal Goods and Services. This pretty much protects your purchase as PayPal almost always sides with the buyer given you have adequate documentation.\n\nOnce you find something and agree on the price, the seller sends you an invoice or money request. Again, always make sure you pay the invoice or send the money through Goods and Services and never Friends and Family.\n\nThe seller should ship within a reasonable timeframe (3 or 4 business days) and should provide you a tracking number.  Once you receive the item, make sure it works and then confirm the trade on the mechmarket confirmation thread. \n\nIf the seller sends you a rock and refuses to refund you, you have 180 days from sending payment to open a dispute with PayPal. They'll ask for more documentation and make a judgment.\n\nThere's not too much scamming going around mechmarket as I tend to believe that the mk community is one of the better communities on reddit; however, you do get some bad apples.  You can also check the number next to the name - that shows you how many confirmed trades/transactions that user has. The higher number, the less likely that user will send you a rock.  Of course everyone has to start somewhere so be wary of users with low confirmed trades but at the same time, don't be afraid to reach out to them if they have an item you want to buy.\n\nIf you get one thing out of my long post, always use Goods and Services when buying anywhere on mechmarket and reddit in general. Feel free to PM me any questions
Using a station with a desoldering vacuum would be the easiest way to swap out LEDs and switches.\n\nIf you don't have access to this, a pump and wick is doable but super time consuming, at least for me.  There are plenty of YouTube tutorials about desoldering so check those out.\n\nBest advice is to take your time. If a joint is giving you issues, add some more solder, let it cool down and then come back to it later.\n\n
If you can wait until January 30th, PMK will be selling some sets through their store front.\n\nJust an idea if you can't find anything here
Nice prices. Should go quick!

Hey, that would be great. I'd be totally willing to take them. I'll PM you my PayPal and I'm in the CONUS. Thanks!!
Super jealous. I'm waiting for mine to come in :( 
Originative only carries PCB mounted stabs and I don't think the ones carried by Switchtop are authentic
Yep. That's pretty much the jist of it. Dark caps they'll print white legends. White caps they'll print black legends
I'd go with the Leopold. It has PBT caps and a detachable cable
Is that a Smart 68??
It's a novatouch so 45g topre
Thanks!
Just wondering if you got a shipping notification or not. I'm in Norcal and haven't received a tracking number yet. Hopefully it's on its way!
What about J-Spaced/Jailhouse Blues and Gateron Tactile Clears? I think J-Spaced blues have been my favorite tactile switches so far.
Hey buddy.  The screws are 8mm long.
Doesn't the K70 have dual cables running through it? One for input and one as a USB pass through?\n\nI'm pretty sure the Filco cable will work for the input portion but he would need another one for the pass through
Replied
Can you post a picture of the PCB? 
Hmmm. Not sure if they'll fit on the new board. I guess I'll wait to measure the dimensions
There's a DSA Wyse
Anne Pro is a pretty cheap 60% keyboard that is Bluetooth compatible
Yep, in 2012 and 2013 with those players. Then we ran into Jason Fucking Verlander and the Tigers both years.  Then Billy Beane blew the team up.  Plus the whole new ballpark situation going no where... It's been rough being an A's fan these past few years
Some switches are more equal than others
Gonna pass on the Eagle.  Thanks for the offer!
How can you tell?
So keys A, C, and 5 don't work?
I'll trade you my 1.75u Shift for the Numpad kit :)
70% meaning a tenkeyless?
Sold ErgoDox GamePad to eternal leader /u/IneffableTao
If only they actually have a crossover w DM.
I'm not sure. They fit the ErgoDox EZ case though. I can also measure them when I get home if you want me to
Je pense que tu es belle
Sick board brah
It sounds going to have to use some wire to jump the c and v switches. Can you take a picture of the PCB?\n\nAlso, the WhiteFox plate allows for switch top opening so you don't have to desolder switches; just open the top and swap the springs and stems (unless you wanted to swap out the houses).
Don't get me started on those stupid panda hats... 
Thanks!
I'm assuming you're looking at mechanicalkeyboards.com?  If so, take a look at the 'Incoming Stock' to see when they come in. \n\nYou can also check out /r/mechmarket if you're willing to purchase second hand?
Nope :( I can throw in some granite 1.5u modifiers for $10 extra
Also DSA Valentine is out there
Wasn't that said about Penumbra? Then a few days before R2, there were multiple selling threads on mm and eBay. Feel pretty bad for those people that bought those sets for extremely marked up prices and then R2 dropped
I can't tell how the pins connect to each other from your pictures. Do you see any traces and can you follow them from pin to pin?
After years of Intel, I'm going to move to AMD for my next build. Thanks for delivering us RYZEN

If the issue still isn't resolved within a reasonable time, then you can make a post.

Bought Zealencios from /u/tim_buckanowski
Thought you couldn't jailhouse Aristotles. Something about having a different click mechanism?\n\nJust wondering if fosens use the same mechanism as Gateron and Cherry clicky switches
Check out https://ctrlalt.io/buys\n\nRan 3 years ago along with HyperFuse DCS.  I've never actually seen the DCS version so I think that might be even rarer than the DSA version
How is this not sold yet? Someone buy it so I can't
Any way to get Cherry MX Silent switches on their own without having to buy a board and desolder?
Thanks!
Unfortunately they're no longer in production. Some background: ZealPC exclusively owns the mold for Zealios and has an Agreement with Gateron to produce them.\n\nGateron used those molds to produce Gateron Tactile Clears, WKL got a hold them and sold them in his shop for a while. \n\nI'm assuming Zeal put a stop to that so they're no longer commercially available
Confirmed

He could be selling in Canadian Dollars so that comes out to be about $150USD

Same here I grabbed one kit of 16GB (8GBx2) of G. Skill Ripjaws V for around $75 off Newegg & then about 2 months later grabbed a matching kit for the same price. I really don't need 32GB of RAM but with the price increase I'm damn happy to have grabbed that much now.

Thanks for posting to /r/DIY!\n\nYour post has been removed because it links to YouTube. YouTube videos are permitted here, but require moderator approval.\n\n**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**\n\nYou have a couple of options:\n\n1. If you are submitting a completed project that meets the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines), and you made the video yourself, you may message the moderators to request that your video be manually reviewed. **Videos must have detailed title cards or narration for all steps.**\n\n2. If you are asking for help with a specific aspect of a DIY project, and are linking to YouTube to explain your problem, please use the [Submit a Help Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/submit?selftext=true) link instead.

If you're asking a question that doesn't meet the "specific question about an *aspect* of a DIY project" requirement, such as "how can I fix the problem shown in this video" or "how can I make the project shown in this video", such posts generally do not meet the help request requirements in our  [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines).

TBH if you plan on manually OCing it really shouldn't matter much. There is a possibility KFA bins their chips to distinguish between the 2 models, but thanks to the silicone lottery a non EX could OC better than an EX or vice versa. Each individual GPU will have it's own limits regarding clock speed at the allowed voltages. Binning helps manufactures to find the better chips of their lot but is not a perfect process by any means. \n\nReally I would say it comes down to how important that extra $15 is too you. If it will cause you to have to compromise on other parts of the build go with the OC, if it is not a big deal & won't cause any compromises on the other parts of your build go EX OC.   
r/hardwareswap, heatware.com, the classified section on OCN.com, etc. Pretty much right now you'll have to go used for that price since the fire sale of all the new ones are over at this point. They are out there for that price though, I just saw a Lightning for $350 on hardwareswap yesterday. 
TBH, this all moot to me. I have tried some of the auto OCing & windows OCing programs for my 6700k & the results were less than ideal VS OCing through the mobo's BIOS. Voltages would jump all over the place, v-droop was horrendous unless the LLC was set properly in the BIOS, etc.\n\nEven if this is a half decent implementation of software OCing I see myself still OCing Ryzen through the mobo's BIOS. Even though from the screenshot they seem to offer much more control than any  OCing programs I have used, I am still willing to bet it ends up like the others with voltages all over the place, heavy v-droop, etc.\n\nIME it seems like when using software to OC, the software & hardware have two different ideas of what to send & end up fighting each other.
Ahh fughet about it!!!!
TBH, I really have yet to notice any distinct advantages using a linear switch for gaming. Now admittedly I haven't had a lot of time with linear switches yet but I was doing some gaming last night & ended up switching back to my MF68 with Gat Greens because I felt they were more responsive. Most likely that is just the learning curve talking since I have used clicky/tactile or tactile switches exclusively up till this board but that is my take on it so far.\n\nAlso I agree with your switch choices for pure typing, personally if I had to type for work I would want a tactile switch like Cherry clears for that.
I would have to say you're doing everybody a disservice with that post. Yes you may be within the max Vcore limit set by Intel, & yes most auto OC settings on mobos will not blow your chip up immediately. But IMHO you are causing extra degradation to your CPU for no reason by running such a high Vcore voltage for such a easily obtainable speed.\n\nWe are talking about everyday usage OC settings here not benchmarking OC settings. So it behooves those of us who plan on running our HW out of spec on a daily basis to find the best balance of extra speed & extra voltage on each of our individual chips. Otherwise you are just causing a ton of extra wear & tear on your CPU with no tangible benefits from it.\n\nNow sure it may take years for the degradation to become noticeable, but make no mistake you are still causing harm to & cutting the useful life of your CPU by running it out of spec in any way. I don't know about you but I tend to try to take decent care of the HW I paid hard earned money for. I see no reason to run a chip into the ground just because it was easier to click & forget than manually tune an OC. That's just my 2 cents on it though.
Very nice! I was so so tempted to get the FC660C when i bought my FC660M but no "ragrets" here. I went with Cherry blacks in mine & have been loving it. I'm sure your loving the Topre variant just as much though! :) \n\nTopre is still very high on my "switch types to try" list but until I get to actually try the different weightings & know I'll like them enough to use them daily I can't justify the expense. Also being honest winter is a tight time for me financially, so going with the 660C over the 660M probably would've meant cutting into bill money or putting it on CC. Responsibilities, gotta love^hate them... ;)
That is how I feel about it as well. Sure anybody with realistic expectations realized from the start that these would end up being CPUs that favor workstation tasks over gaming, but AMD pushed this more as a gaming or gaming & streaming CPU than a workstation one as far as I seen. I did follow Ryzen pretty closely too.\n\nNot only that but AMD really needs gamers to get behind Ryzen for it to truly take off IMHO. Most professionals will just buy Intel & NV regardless of price because they know with them they will have a very stable platform & proven performance. Nobody who relies on their PC for their livelihood is gonna jump right on to Ryzen. It's way to new & unproven to entrust your paycheck too.
Well even though I am broke AF at the moment, I somehow see a Varmilo V87M in my future. My wallet: *funny stares* Me: **Don't judge me!!!!** I'm^not^crazy^I^swear^!
Go windows, go windows, it's your birthday, have a party...
I found the QC to be lacking on the Cherry Whites in my KBP V60 as well. Not sure if it was a certain production run or if it is just the case in general with whites. Although they did make me realize I prefer the heavier switches to the lighter ones. I recently got a Leopold FC660M with Cherry blacks & it feels like typing on air after using Cherry whites, clears, & Gateron greens daily for many months.
Nice find!
Hell I'll take "Available: When it is finished" any day over the  usual "Available: Now, because we're greedy & realized some people will pay us to be beta testers. But we gotta figure out a way to cover our asses on it, so umm... EARLY ACCESS!!!!"
Thanks for the info! it's looking like your average Cherry blue clone then, which kills my interest unfortunately. I prefer very heavy switches & was thinking I'd give this board a shot if it had 80g switches. A cheap BT capable 60% with heavy switches would make a perfect traveling board for me, as I prefer to not carry my more expensive KBs. \n\nOh well, maybe I'll give it another look once I get all my soldering equipment & supplies, after that I could customize it to my liking. :)
PMed
See I'm the exact opposite, I find Cherry Blacks to be too light & somewhat slow on the up stroke. I usually prefer the heavier switches, Cherry clears, Cherry/Gat greens, Cherry greys (linear or tactile), etc are my favs. Although I eventually want to give all switch types a try so I got Cherry blacks in this to mix things up a bit. I think with a heavier spring & good lubing the blacks would suit my tastes better but I do realize I am in the minority with my switch preferences. 
Damn, sorry to hear that u/jchan94 :( My family just went through something similar. Hope all ends well for you & your family! :) 
Yep at the prices back then you couldn't go wrong. I was kinda hesitant going up to 32GB on 4 sticks since I have heard of some people having issues using 4 sticks & XMP with Skylake, but thankfully my 6700k & GB Gaming 7 took them like a champ! :) 
Not sure if the description is serious by saying it has custom blue switches that are the equivalent of Cherry greens, or if the seller just doesn't know what he is talking about? OP can you confirm the weighting of the switches? 
There is no words that describe how awesome that cap is, especially to an old gamer like me that grew up on NES! Ahh the memories... :) Anyways great job with the cap & if you can ever decide to make a bunch for sale put me down for one!
K, thanks for the advice, I'm thinking of doing some type of symbol on mine as well. If I do I will give you full credit for the idea. I've been thinking about different ways to customize one of the extra face plates I had for mine but you nailed with this idea IMO!
Here's the thing everyone is forgetting & or denying while bashing Gamer's Nexus, Jayz2cents, or any review that showed Ryzen's lower than expected gaming performance. Ryzen R7 chips ARE marketed towards gamers! The was way more talk from AMD about what Ryzen R7s will do to change the PC gaming landscape than what it will do to change the professional market. \n\nI think they are spot on with their reviews & criticism because of this. The "well it's an 8c 16t chip & not made for gaming" argument holds no weight here. Just look at the mobos available, I don't think there is a single WS focused Ryzen mobo yet. I don't know about you but to me that screams AMD is pinning their hopes more on gamers adopting these chips than professionals.\n\nAlthough really IMO everybody should be happy with Ryzen. It is a beast of a chip that closely competes with Intel at most tasks, the gaming performance is really pretty damn good just doesn't beat Intel's 4c 8t chips, & the pricing is great. I don't think AMD could've done much more with Ryzen considering it's a whole new arch & they aren't exactly printing money at their HQ like Intel or NV is right now.\n\nBe happy Ryzen is competitive as it is. No matter which side you're on it will benefit us all by pushing CPU prices down & re-kindling the performance war between Intel & AMD. Even if Ryzen doesn't get much better through BIOS & microcode updates it still is a winner in my book. \n\nThe only flaw I would call out with Ryzen's release is AMD gearing the R7 chips more towards gamers than professionals. I think they should've matched Intel's X99 platform feature for feature with these & marketed them more to professionals. Then used the R5 & R3 lineups to target gamers. If that would have been done I doubt there would be so much vitriol over reviewers pointing out Ryzen's shortcomings with gaming. 
LOL, I completely understand your situation. I'm a carpenter by trade but a PC & mech KB enthusiast at heart. 99% of my workers & co-workers have no idea mech KBs are even a thing & don't know anything about the inner workings of a PC. They also think I am 100% crazy for spending thousands of dollars on PC & KB stuff. XD
Yes this is a newer model of FC660 that has a normal 6.25u spacebar. Not sure what size SB the older models had but I'm pretty sure the odd sized SB of the older models is what made it such a pain to get key cap sets that fit them.
Oh yeah don't get me wrong you do have a pretty decent OC on your 970 at between 1450 to 1500 on the core. 1500 is around the threshold Maxwell (even the small die GM204) can hit on air & remain stable in games. There are some golden GM204 chips out there that can push that to around 1550 but we are talking about the top 1% of chips produced at that point. Also most of those get binned out & go in the highest end models of 3rd party cards.\n\nIf your 970 (especially it being a non binned chip in the regular EVGA ACX2) hits 1500 (gaming stable) you have a pretty damn good chip for the product you bought. Really I just wanted to inform you of the issues Unigine benchs have reading core clocks.
Now that I've found that linear switches are something that I do like I have full intentions of trying them. IME Gats seem to have an edge over their Cherry counter parts in feel when they are brand new, once broken in they both take on a similar feel with Gats staying a bit smoother. Although Gat greens & blues are what I have experience with so that may not hold true across all the variants.
I was at the Civic Arena for that KotR, UT even threw Foley off the side of the cage facing our seats. It was one of the craziest things I've ever seen in person. The whole place went dead quiet when it happened, I think we all thought it was a mistake & we just witnessed someone get severely hurt or die. Then when he got up off the stretcher & returned to the ring the place exploded. Good shit there, but it kinda ruined wrestling for me from there on out. Nobody will ever be able to top that match unless they literally murder each other in the ring. 
Very cool design, I'll be trying my luck in the raffle for sure. The caps do a seem a little tall next to DSA keys, but that should be less of an issue with other taller profiles. Maybe make a shorter version for DSA & XDA cap owners if it possible to do so fairly easily.

Finally can let myself start to get excited for Sky Dolch! Thanks for the update!
Ah the good ole fat PS3, that brings back some memories for me. :) I got a fat 80GB that has been kicking for about 10 yrs. also. It is one of the CECHL01 models though so no BC & only 2 USB ports for me. Which was alright to me since I still had a PS2 when I bought it.\n\nWord of advice for anybody still using a fat PS3 though. Crack that sucker open & replace the super cheap ceramic TIM they use on the APU. Replace it with MX4, AS5, etc. & you'll never have to worry about the dreaded YLOD.
I'm getting there! The Vortex Cores are pretty nice looking but I may wait till I foray into making custom KBs before I go 40%. :)
Wow that brings back memories there! 
Same here, I shot him some criticism over a video he did about the Galax 1070 & he reacted like a spoiled bitch. Check it out,\n\nRob R3 months ago - \nCome on Salazar Studio, that was a total rip off of Jayz2cents review of the Maxwell Titan X. I was becoming a fan of your channel but after seeing some the decisions you made on the walter white builds & the debacle they became, then the "I stepped on my mobo" video, now this a blatant rip off of another video card review video. I'm starting to find your videos much less compelling to watch.﻿\nShow less\nReply     \nHide replies \nSalazar Studio3 months ago - \nRobert R What? I got this idea from Paul. Not Jay. Never seen his video. Get a grip.﻿\nReply     \nSalazar Studio3 months ago - \nRobert R *and block me.﻿\nReply     \nRob R3 months ago - \nNo problem, ask you shall receive. I am now unsubscribed from your channel. I was just offering some constructive criticism but apparently that is something you do not take well judging from your juvenile response. \n\nGood luck keeping your subs up & getting new fans with an attitude like that. Dismissing  a viewer's criticism & responding it to by telling them to "block me" is a terrible way of dealing with it. Also it speaks volumes to me about what type of person you are.\n\nIt's not like I attacked or insulted you in any way, all I did was call you out on the unoriginal content of this video, the questionable decisions you made leading to your walter white build dying, & IMO the overall bad quality of your channel lately. If you put it out there for the world to see you should expect some criticism & be handling that criticism in a much more mature fashion IMHO.﻿\nRead more\nReply\n\nHe never replied to my last response so I think trying to give this guy constructive criticism is like trying to draw blood from a rock. 
Awesome cause guys, love to see stuff like this especially from the creators in our community! GLWS! :)
Same here, I commented up higher in the thread about the same thing. NJ to KY to Pgh., PA just makes no sense even taking distribution hubs into account.
Well I would say that is your own fault, every kid from the 90's knows Jun Pus was the secret of the ooze & how Vanilla Ice got so big....
Yes sir, build buddies it is! XD
It always seems to go like this, flurries of GBs at the same time & never enough money in my account! :( I definitely feel your pain u/slashemperor, I'm also hoping to squeak into the MC Rebirth GB before it closes but it's gonna be tight for me as well. 
Ouch, sorry to see/hear that man. We're all human mistakes happen, I know that doesn't take the sting out any though. R.I.P. to a good chip :(
2FA, IMHO is an absolute must for any account you have that supports it. Sure it can be a minor inconvenience to have to take an extra step to sign in & also have to DL multiple apps to your smart phone to use 2FA. But that is a inconvenience I am willing to accept for more security & feel that it takes a special kind of lazy to find it unacceptable.\n\nI mean if you think about it most everybody has their smart phone within reaching distance at all time & all the apps for the different 2FA systems are free. All it really requires is that you open an app on your phone (or an email for some older 2FA systems) then typing in an extra code to prove your identity. Easily a fair trade off for extra security to me.\n\nNow being honest I usually do enable 2FA on most of my accounts, but had a few accounts that I opened before they offered 2FA & never updated them. That was enough to almost get me in a major mess recently. Not too long ago I had my PSN account stolen because I never bothered activating 2FA on it after they offered the service. Thankfully it was an incompetent individual who stole my account, I had long ago removed any financial info of mine from the PSN, & starting using pre paid PSN cards for purchases on there after the 1st major PSN hack.\n\nAnyways, however the person got into my PSN account they only decided to change the login email & not my password. Allowing me to sign in from my PS4 & regain control of my account very easily. Also the only damage the were able to do was spend the $20 I had on my PSN account for FIFA points. Sony's CS even refunded me that $20 without fighting me on it when I called to report my issue & report the hackers email address, which really surprised me. Although TBH, if I didn't have a group of friend who game exclusively on PS4 that probably would have been the end of console gaming for me. The PSN has proven to not be secure plenty of times & while XBL has had less security issues I still would not trust it with my financial info even with 2FA.\n\nAfter that even though I've had 2FA enable on many of my accounts from the beginning I did a double check & enabled it for the PSN along with any other account I have that offers it but I never set it up with. It is an unfortunate reality nowadays, but just like u/Nizatron said. Enable 2FA right from the go on any account it is offered for, or suffer the consequences later down the road one way or another.\n
Thanks for the quick reply :) So it is either a typo or uninformed sellers that they are comparable to Cherry greens. Most blue switch have from 55g to 60g weighting, Razer (Kailh) greens are meant to emulate Cherry blues with 60g weighting & slightly less actuation distance. Cherry greens on the other hand have 80g weighting & were 1st designed as a spacebar switch for Cherry KBs with blues. Maybe the seller meant it was comparable to Razer green switches?

Yes the Ducky One is a pretty solid board. It would make for a great intro to mech KBs if you haven't had one before or a great upgrade from a "gaming' mech KB like Corsair's or Logitech's line up. The only thing I would suggest is to not bother with the stock key caps. Putting a set of thick PBT or ABS caps on will change the feel of any mech KB for the better. I personally prefer PBT but high quality thick ABS caps produce a similar change on the feel of the key stroke. ABS just doesn't have the textured finger feel PBT does.
Had some issues with the screw holes in the case being stripped out but that was nothing a screw that was a tiny bit wider couldn't fix! :) (I used round head machine screws sized #6-32X1/2" to fix it) All in all I am pretty pleased with the KB so far despite my bad initial experience. I got the 70g springs in mine & they are much lighter than I expected so hopefully XMIT offers some heavier variants in the future.\n\nAs far as typing goes it is a pleasurable experience with this board, although even with the switches linear nature it is a louder board to type on because of the upstroke. I would compare the weighting to a 45g MX switch as KBT browns offer the closest resistance out of the switch types I have on hand. Comparing to Cherry blacks the blacks definitely feel a good bit heavier to me.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend this board to a mech KB enthusiast looking for something off the beaten path of MX & Topre. The only caveat is that I would not recommend this board for anywhere where noise may become an issue unless you feel like doing some modding to the switches to dampen the upstroke.\n\nDampening the upstroke on this is something that I intend on looking into & will report back if I find any good solutions.
It's actually just a Ducky PBT dye sub set with a black left Shift key from a Vortex PBT/POM set. I used the ./Del key from the numpad to replace the 1u Windows key the FC660s have. The only 2 odd sized keys on the FC660s are the 2.25u right shift & the 1u Windows key.
Traded a Topre Fire Guppy Fugu to u/haytorious
Looks awesome but the light bleed is surprising for a SP set. For the price I would be expecting thick PBT that doesn't have the bleed through. Could you please post some pics of the bottoms of an alpha & modifier key if you get a chance? I'm really tempted to order a set now that they are back in stock at PMK. But if they are not really thick PBT I'll pass & just keep on waiting for the Godspeed SA & Sky Dolch sets I ordered to get through the production hell that has engulfed SP & GMK.
Still besides the point to me. Even at 4k, if you are just using your PC for strictly gaming the 7700k is a better buy. Right now the results for 4k gaming are GPU bound, so sure you will get roughly the same performance out of a Ryzen R7 chip & 7700k. The caveat being that when the next gen of GPUs arrives & you upgrade. You will be shifting the bottleneck back towards the CPU, then you end up with worse 4k performance on the Ryzen R7 chips than on a 7700k. Just like the 1080p performance with current GPUs.\n\nWith the GPU bottlenecked you could make an i3 perform the same as a i7 & claim the are equal for gaming. Although that would not really be true & the more GPU horsepower you put in the i3 rig the worse your CPU will perform compared to the i7 rig.
Nice, I've been wanting to try out an Anne Pro myself for some time. I hear they are pretty nice KBs & the wireless functionality is a definite bonus for some. If you are currently using browns the switch to blues should be smooth for you. IME blues are just a tad heavier than browns but provide a much cleaner keystroke especially towards the bottom of a key press. I also bottom out much less with blues but everybody will have their own preferences. Hope you like the new KB & be sure to post some pics once you get it! :) 
I agree with that for sure & your statement is very close to the reasons I gave some auto & software based OC programs a try. I just found their end results to be too inconsistent & possibly damaging to a chip. (Using GB's easy tune my 6700k was getting fed well over 1.4v to just reach 4.5GHz which I can do at 1.296v manually! :O)\n\nIt is possible that AMD worked the kinks out & this software will be a viable option for OCing Ryzen chips. Although TBH,I won't feel safe using it till it is proven to be a viable & safe OCing route given my other experiences with auto & software based OCing of CPUs.
I would suggest trying out a mech KB with linear switches. I'm thinking you BW has either Cherry blues or Razer (Kalih) greens which are clicky switches that make much more noise than linear switches. I would also look at offerings from Leopold, Filco, Vortex, Ducky, etc. & ditch Razer but that's just my personal preference. \n\nRazer receives a lot of hate on this sub reddit because like all "gaming" mech KBs from companies that make a ton of other products. The QC is not as good as it should be & they use the MX clone switches that are the cheapest for them to buy in bulk. Also Razer actually used to make half decent mech KBs with genuine Cherry switches which are higher quality products than their current offerings. So IMO lower QC, more inconsistent switches, & higher failure rates with their newer products is what is causing most of the hate for Razer on this sub.
Upvoted & here's my comment. GLWS & GL to everybody else in the giveaway! :)
This article highlights why I'm still happily rocking a 980ti. The only cards out there that can truly surpass it is the 1080 & Titan XP. For $300 & under you really can't go wrong with the 980ti right now IMHO.\n\nThe FuryX is a little different to me considering it only has 4GB of VRAM, shows very little gains from OCing, does not OC well, & lands to low on performance to justify $300 even brand new to me. Although if you found one at $250 or below then I would consider it a worthwhile purchase.
I was in the same boat & got lucky with that set. I found it on r/mechmarket for a really decent price. Just gotta keep your eyes peeled. If I do see another set for sale I'll give you a heads up. Nothing quite like a set of proper thick PBT caps! :)
Glad to hear! :) The full sized bamboo looks amazing, almost makes me re-think my decision on the 60% LOL! The issues with my case was mostly down to them having reopen the cases at the factory for the stem swap that occurred. I would imagine they are using those overhead pneumatic drills in most factories & whoever re-assembled my board probably just way over tightened the screws.\n\nI spoke with XMIT about & it seems that mine was an isolated incident anyways. Also he said he is most likely changing to some type of sex bolt for the cases on the next run VS relying on the case material itself like with these.
They're gone already :(
This is an issue I had to contend with during the building of my current rig, since I am using an AIO CPU cooler & a GPU with a open air cooler. My solution was to get a case that had mounting spaces for 3 - 120mm fans at the top. Then install my AIO's rad in the the front/middle fan mounting points (I have a 240mm rad) & a 120mm in the rear mounting point, all 3 fans exhausting. http://imgur.com/0xShf8t \nMy overall fan setup is like this just for reference, http://imgur.com/h4xOzHG\n\nMy relevant specs are a 6700k running 4.5GHz core & cache at 1.296v, GB xtreme 980ti running 1503/2001MHz at 1.21v, Corsair H100i GTX with Noctua NF-F12 ippc 2k fans in pull, & a NZXT Source 530 full tower. My max temps on the CPU are 71c after a 4 hr run of Realbench stress test using all my RAM (32GB of 3200MHz DDR4) & my max temps on the GPU are 68c after  a 2hr run of Heaven.  \n\nOf course the case you want to use will play a huge role in which orientation of your rad will work best for you. I just wanted to throw my setup out there cause I think I managed to strike a nice balance in a usually GPU biased cooling setup. \n\nThere is one caveat with my particular setup I should mention though. I suspect I get better CPU cooling because I have a disk drive installed in my PC, which cause the front half of my rad to be kinda isolated from the in case air & draw more fresh air through the front grill than if I did not have a disk drive installed. I have not done any testing on this but figured it was worth a mention.\n\nAgain I have to stress that each build will have it's own optimal cooling setup as far as fan placement, rad placement, etc. goes, depending on the parts selected. This post is meant to be just food for thought for anybody facing this issue, not a declaration of the way it should be done.
Oh man, those mouse pads are pretty sweet! Hopefully I can cop one before they sell out. I desperately need a large mouse pad, right now I am using 2 side by side in order to fit my KB+mouse on them. BTW u/jchan94 thanks for helping me out with my latest order from you! I really appreciate it but didn't want to open another ticket just to say TY! :) 
I haven't tried Cherry Greens yet but do have a MF68 with Gat greens & I absolutely love the feel of them. Considering you prefer Gat over Cherry Blues I would say you're more than safe with ordering the Gat greens.
Hmm, haven't a ton of time with the Cherry blacks yet but vs clears I would have to go with clears. I personally lean more towards clicky/tactile or tactile switches & the heavier the better for me. Don't get me wrong the blacks do feel awesome & have a very distinct feel compared to non linear switches. But my 2 complaints of stock blacks would be they are too light & have a very slow upstroke compared to any other switch I have tried. I think a spring swap to something like 67g springs & good lubing would make the blacks feel a lot better to someone who has preferences like me. That is probably what I will end up doing with this board TBH. Although I'm sure there are many who would disagree & find stock Cherry blacks perfect.
While I do agree this issue is getting way overblown because you can run up to 3200MHz on 2 sticks. I also think it is an issue that needs to be corrected quickly to not put a tarnish on Ryzen. Intel fanboys are gonna be looking for any reason to bash Ryzen & blow every little imperfection up like it's proving Ryzen is flawed or not as good as Intel chips.\n\nAlthough the funny truth of this situation is that Z170 & Sky Lake had the same exact problem when it released. Which I can personally vouch for cause I had to deal with it being an early adopter of Skylake. Hopefully AMD gets it worked out quickly, I am planning a Ryzen build & it would be nice to not have to buy more & slower DDR4 for it. Especially considering how the price of DDR4 has shot through roof lately...
I do have to say Jelly Key is pretty awesome about helping out when issues arise with orders & shipments of theirs. I won the Kindred cap giveaway awhile back & they accidentally sent me an Abandoned Maze cap in the 1st place. I was pretty pissed when I opened the package to find a much more common cap than I was supposed to receive (afaik there was only 5 Kindred caps ever made by JK). But after some emails back & forth they found the Kindred cap & made sure it got to me.\n\nThey did ask for the Abandoned Maze cap back though & I agreed to send it back to them as long as they paid for the shipping, since I had to pay for the shipping of the Kindred cap ($50 bills for tracked shipping from them to the US! :O ). Although I did never hear back from them about it & even sent a couple emails to them about it afterwards. So I'm guessing they decided to let me keep the Abandoned Maze cap to make up for the mix up? \n\nEither way they definitely went above & beyond to make sure they came through with what they had promised. Also you have to remember I won a giveaway of theirs & was not a paying customer in this situation. To me that speaks volumes about what type of people they. :)
Tiny Rick MFers!!!!!! Cause that's the way the news goes! :)

Very nice, still waiting on mine to arrive. I almost went with the bamboo TKL but decided on the bamboo 60%. Glad to hear you're liking it, look forward to an update after you spent some time with it!
Welcome to fold & protect your wallet! XD
I wouldn't go as far as saying it's absolutely ridiculous. Maybe it's because I am a carpenter & work with my hands for a living but I am biased towards the heaviest weighted switches myself as well. \n\nFor the past few months I have been switching between Cherry clears, Cherry whites, & Gateron greens all of which I personally think would be better with heavier springs. Recently I got a Leopold FC660M with Cherry blacks & while I am really liking the linear feel they need to be heavier to suit my tastes better. Compared to the 3 prior switches I was DDing they felt like typing on air as a 1st impression TBH. When I get all my soldering gear together desoldering the blacks & putting heavier springs in them (probably 100g to start with) is one of my 1st planned projects.
No DHL (at least when shipping for MD) just likes to fuck around it seems. My MF68 I recently got from MD had one of the weirdest shipping routes I've ever seen. I live in SW PA (Greater Pittsburgh area) but my KB went from MD's warehouse in NJ straight to Kentucky (WTF!?), then from KY to wherever they DHL drops off packages to the USPS in my area, then finally from the USPS to me. There is no way even taking distribution hubs in to account that sending my package from NJ to KY makes any sense considering I live in PA.\n\nIf MD offered free shipping this BS would be more tolerable, but to have to pay to watch whatever I bought play "package pinball" all over the north east US is completely unacceptable to me. TBH I would probably do a lot more purchases through MD if they offered a more expensive yet faster shipping option. Unfortunately, with the current deal they have with DHL I will only buy stuff that can not be gotten anywhere else other than MD from them.
MAN DOWN, MAN DOWN!!!!!!!!
OMG, who was the shipping through!? I have bought a ton of stuff through MK.com using their free shipping option & have never had any issues. Although I do live in the US only a few states away from MK.com's warehouse. Glad to hear it worked when you tried it out but I'll echo some other responses I seen here. Even though everything seems fine now if water managed to get into any switches or on the PCB it could lead to the KB dying or malfunctioning much earlier than it should. I would definitely try to get a hold of MK.com & the shipping company to let them know your package arrived in a terrible state. After spending the money for a Pok3r then waiting over 2 months for shipping, I know I would damn sure want an explanation & reimbursement of some sort.
As much as I do prefer heavier springs I have to agree going back to a lighter weighted switch does make typing feel easier & faster. I guess it really comes down to adjusting to what you're using at the time TBH. When I 1st got this FC660M with blacks I kinda hated the feel cause I was constantly heavily bottoming out my keystrokes. But now after a few weeks of DDing it I have gotten used to the lighter weighting & am actually starting to like it. 
Finally some more artisan spacebars! Love the colorways BTW. GL on the giveaway everybody! :)
And I thought I was bad with 6 keebs.... Awesome collection though OP! :)
+1 for sure, looks great OP! :) What was the process to get the light to shine through in such a big area? Did you just sand the paint off of the original cover?\n\nI have a H100i GTX as well & a few extra face plates for the pump since I ordered the color kit for it. Seeing this got my creative juices flowing & I would like to do a similar mod to one of my face plates.
Same here, LOL! Happy belated b-day & nice board!
Exclusively on everything...
Check your temps while running Time Spy & Cinebench. Sounds like your CPU is downclocking for some reason, it may be thermal throttling.
Spot on!
It worries me as well that AMD is the company that we have to rely on to shake up the PC hardware market, unfortunately that is our only hope atm. I also don't mind Intel's pricing as much as others do & feel NV is definitely taking more advantage of their market dominance as well. The only reason I mentioned that before was because I think they have both stopped pushing the envelop as hard as they can. Stagnation IMHO is worse than high prices for us consumers. That is why I want AMD to succeed with Ryzen & Vega so badly. \n\nAlthough I do agree that jumping on the hype train before actual benchmarks are provided is a bad idea given AMD's recent track record. I mean FuryX is the "overclocker's dream" according to them so... More than anything I just want to the market get shook up again so there are powerful & very capable parts available even at the entry level. \n\nI think that the gap between entry, mid, & high level part pricing will continue to grow & performance will stagnate if Intel & NV are left to their own devices. I really don't have a preference of what company makes it happen. Hell if Chef Boyardee released a CPU & GPU that shook up the market it would be just the same if Ryzen & Vega succeed to me, lol.\n\nI'm hoping Nv starts to support freesync as well, it is so much more affordable & becoming much more of a standard than Gsync is so you might be right about them not having much of a choice in the matter. When you think about it AMD really put themselves in a bad position business wise here. If Nv was to allow support for both free & gsync it would be a dagger in the heart of AMD's graphics division.\n\nGuess we'll just have to wait it out to see what really comes out of Ryzen & Vega. I'm hoping for a shake up & some change in the industry because of them but there is still a possibility both could flop. Good points on all you have brought up & I look forward to further discussing it when they finally release. It really is nice to have a conversation about hardware with someone who is not biased & has a better understand of the tech than most!\n
You do got some very points there. I do agree with the Fury + Freesync being a really good option right now. Also 980ti have been becoming harder & harder to find. Although at this point for someone who has a budget of over $500 for their GPU waiting for 1080ti & Vega to release would the best move. \n\nI'm hoping they do finally announce the 1080ti on the 27th. That or Vega will most likely be my next upgrade. I plan on going G or Freesync as well once I do upgrade my GPU. I thought they both just mostly marketing hype until I actually got to play on a Gsync monitor. I've wanted one since then & do agree they definitely smooth the experience out tremendously. I'm waiting till I upgrade though since I can't say for sure that my next GPU will be a Nvidia one.\n\nTBH, even though I am running an Intel/Nvidia system right now I am really hoping Zen & Vega are both monsters. Intel & Nvidia need to be reigned in some. I know most complain about $1,200 Titan XPs & $1700 6950Xs & but I feel like their dominance has started to stagnate progress some.\n\n\n\n\n\n
LOL, is this Salazar? I definitely did not call him a liar nor was I a dick to him in anyway if you bothered to read. I simply called him out for plagurizing ideas & he even admitted it!Also never claimed to be the better person in the situation. This reply to my post seems highly defensive for no reason...
Well technically with the right mobo & BIOS you can still do base clock OCing on locked Sky Lake processors.
Glad to hear everything is going smoothly for you guys with this GB so far. I was honestly bummed out big time I couldn't get in on the GB for Terminal, but hearing you'll have extras gives me hope I may get to call one of those beautiful sets my own. \n\nGonna have to start making some moves to free up the money for a pre-order & fast, as I'm sure the extras will be claimed very quickly. Anyways GL with the rest of the process for bringing us Terminal & also with whatever you guys do in the future! :)
Jimmy Jangles Jazzy Ragtime Experiment....
Have you verified that core clock speed with anything other than Heaven's read outs? Heaven & Valley never read the core clocks right & always reports a much higher core clock than you are truly running. He is an example, http://imgur.com/a/Ag1um, as you can see from the RTSS read out my 980ti is actually running at 1503 core/2001 memory but Heaven's core clock read out is 1642MHz (oh how I wish my 980ti went that high on air). \n\nNot trying to rain on your parade but this is a well know flaw with Uningine benchmarks & I would hate to see you get blasted for misrepresenting your clocks on here or other sites. With Heaven telling you your core clock is at 1600MHz your 970 is probably running around 1450MHz on the core in reality. \n\nDo like I did & run Heaven with the OSD from AB/RTSS open or just check what the graphs say on AB after a run of Heaven to see what clock speed your core is truly hitting. Nobody can tell from the pics you submitted since you do not have the core clock graph showing on AB.
Oh this is funny, sounds like I touched a sore spot with you LOL! BTW when he said that he got the idea from Paul not Jay... So there you go, he lifted the idea elsewhere & admitted it was unoriginal. Here's [Jays video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsCIdqIqbgM) for reference.\n\nFurthermore I still don't see how you are taking my OG comment about dude's video as an attack. I stated that I felt his video was a blatant rip off of Jays TitanXM review & that some of his prior videos were not good IMO. Where do I attack him or speak to him nasty in anyway?
I wouldn't feel too bad. Seems like the GB went well & XMIT is hopefully planning future runs with various improvements over these. Also the next run might have a clicky/tactile variant.
Not sure how I am gonna fund this set but I'm gonna make it happen one way or another. Just a got a FC660M & I think it will look killer on it! GL with the sale u/TheKeyCompany, I'm looking forward to bringing a set home! :)

You might want to reset the layer then make sure you properly remapped the l_ctrl. Make sure when you program the key, you do Fn+whatever rather than l_ctrl+whatever.
Hey can you add me? Been looking for Dragonair for a while!

Like what iNViSiBiLiTi said, the pok3r doesn't use any software on the OS. The windows key acts like the command key, and media keys seem to work with Chrome (I have a plugin to control Youtube, GPlay Music etc.). Volume controls also work.
Hey would you mind adding me?
You should check in a month from now. I started getting the double click issue about a month after I got mine first edition, and the firmware update didn't do anything.
I'm sure most people with a G403 doesn't have the weight in their mouse

You literally just described what the G403 is for :) As long as you're okay with the high back hump, it is a great mouse all around.
Cool thanks. My friend has clears and they feel too heavy for me.
added
Correct.
Okay I'll probably be sitting on it for a while, no rush for me. Do you have any suggestions as to mod vs zealio?
http://imgur.com/a/CN7oB here is a fairly thorough guide of o-rings.\n\nPersonally I have 1.5mm o-rings with 70A hardness. It helps suppress the noise while keeping the bottom out feel similar.
They aren't available anywhere. If I were you, I'd avoid FinalMouse altogether. Their support is laughable.
I charge mine with other micro-USB cables, and have had no problems.
added
Not sure if you're looking for a set or a single keycap, but [this](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1507) comes to mind
Thanks again!!
It actually happened.
added
If a certain shortcut doesn't work you can just reprogram the specific shortcut
Can someone please just post the instructions here if they manage to get ahold of finalmouse? I swear they have my email blocked.
Maybe what you meant is a stem swap? The springs in browns and reds are meant to be the same in terms of force.
You can only have the left or right side buttons working at one time. They are mouse 4 and mouse 5

I'd be interested, with the main reason being that I live in Canada and it's really hard to get my hands on this without paying a fortune for shipping. Would you be able to ship to Canada? (and obviously I pay a bit more for shipping)\n\nI'm a bit of a noob when it comes to Krytox lubes; will the 100/205 mix suffice for all types of switches? What about stabs?
hey I added you
you would need shine-though keycaps if you want the legends to be backlit, but I have the white Pok3r RGB and the colors shine nicely even with blank keycaps
Please listen to the others and don't buy finalmouse. You will regret it.
Yveltal if you want?
Yeah I looked there and most of the Zealios are out of stock. If I don't have any luck here I will probably just keep an eye on that and get a 12 pack switch tester so I only have to pay once for shipping. Thanks

Not all mice are the exact same. You've already found the sensitivity that produces the same results in game, so what's the big deal? 
Hey, I'd really appreciate an add for the ditto if you don't mind. Also I'm 99% sure there isn't a workaround to not disconnect from PSS
I've had the exact same issue with the mouse and their support. I've returned my mouse and have given up on the company. 
If you are content with the "click sound" of the FK1, you might want to try the ZA series. They have higher backs than the FK series.\n\nAlso, the G403 has a steep back.
added
Because FinalMouse
Pming
I don't have an EC2-A, but it's 3mm shorter than the G403, but otherwise similar in shape. If the height doesn't bother you, the G403 is a safe mouse to get. Just know that the back of the mouse if quite steep and can dig into your palm a bit if you are using a full palm grip.
FK2, even if you full palm it.
I have the exact same hand size and found the fk2 a bit small for my claw grip. If you have a fingertip grip I would happily recommend the fk2, otherwise you might want to consider the fk1 or za12. The za13 would probably be too small 
can you add me please?\n
added
Thanks, I'll add you and be online
I appreciate it. Could you log on to PSS when you get a sec?
Added
Sure thing, thanks!
Lame. Is that a hardware issue? Cause if so I'll just return it and move on from FM. I've only had issues so far with both their mice and their support
Pick me

The G403 has a much higher back compared to the FK1. I personally like the FK1 way better for comfort (19cm hands with a subtle claw grip).
Hey I'd appreciate the add!
How do you know it's not your other mouse that isn't "perfect"?
The ZA11 is essentially an FK1 with a higher back, whereas the ZA12 is a higher FK2. I would probably recommend the ZA11 if you are looking to full palm and have long fingers. I have a 19cm long hand and the FK1 fits me well. FK2 was too small for me
hey I don't have any of those but I'm looking for a ditto, would do me a huge solid if you'd add me
Hey do you mind if I add you?

Are you aware that a bunch of people got ignored by FM support?
I've had a serious debounce issue since I got mine and have not received an email response from their support since. The firmware update didn't solve it whatsoever. Honestly I was really hoping it did as I wanted to like the mouse. It's just a shame that it took a year to release a broken product then have the worst support I've seen of any company ever.
If you want an ergonomic shape, the EC2-A is fine. Otherwise, you have a choice between the ZA series and the FK series. It seems like you don't like mice with a big hump in the back, which would suggest that you would like the FK series better. The FK2 is pretty much the ZA12 except quite a bit shallower. I have an FK1 and 19cm hands and love it.

Well supposedly if you solder them in or just push them in with a solder tip, you should have better results than me. That's what I've been told. So maybe try that. If you look at the other comment in this thread from Wilba he actually goes over it better than I can, especially since he designed the PCB if I'm not wrong.
Huh, sounds interesting. Might have to get some to try it out. I've always thought about lining, but never really felt the need. But if I'm planning on making my Viper my end-all board I should get as complex as possible. 
Defenders were tremendously wide spread. Lots and lots of those out and about.\n\nThese BBv2s were rarer and less wide spread, so they're much more valuable.
What kinda padding did you throw in there? And how come two layers?
What's the colorway of the Monkey on the far right, the blue one? Looks real snazzy
Cos I'm 99% sure they're stainless steel weights just based off their color, but as far as I know, there were only brass weights that came with the normal GB.\n\nPlus, there's no FMJ engraving on the top of the case, so I might've been bamboozled about it actually being FMJ. It's still really nice tho otherwise. 
I could've made an exception, if you didn't manage to break 3 rules in the span of half an hour. So, no.

They're very eh. \n\nThey started very scratchy, but after a few uses in a board, they've seemed to loosen up a little. So they're a bit better.

Love me some ErgoClears.
It actually feels like a vase, or really any piece of ceramic that you might have around the house. It has a bit of a glossy texture to it, I don't really know how to explain it other than comparing it to other ceramic items. Definitely holds true to the name, and is a pretty cool feeling. 
That is his store, but based off what I've heard from others about him not responding about his currently running GB, I'd much rather not purchase anything from there and get it a year later. \n\nI'm definitely open to anything! 
Should be good
Kinda fairly often? I'd say maybe 1 in every 2 sales has them in some form. \n\nHe'll do sales on both CtrlAlt.io and on GeekHack. His CtrlAlt.io sales are usually announced and open for a while, while his GeekHack sales you have to watch his forum for. 
OG Beige does sound nice too, would just need to source that. Too bad I sold off my Classic Retro, I'm sure that would've looked nice.

Ah okay, thanks. \n\nUnfortunately missing 7u stuff so I'll pass. \n\nGLWS! 
The 200 requests for a redrop is more of an Interest Check thing. Which also doesn't ensure it happens. \n\nYou have to understand MassDrop doesn't create any of these things, they just serve as a group buy manager. So they still have to work out specifics with other people, who ever would be the actual producer of the product. \n\n[DCS Skull Squadron](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/skull-squadron-keycap-set) is a good example of this. The drop ended in **2014** and has been sitting above 200 requests for a long time. But matt3o was the person who actually ran the buy (as in was the person who designed the set and passed it to MassDrop to handle) and has stated that it will never come back. Hence, MassDrop has their hands tied. 
It's not a power trip, rather it's noting your blatant disregard for reading the rules. 
Grass Knot was for Slowbro and the likes of Quag, maybe even some Hippo. Even 0 investment Jolly Grass Knot does more to standard Slowbro.

Haha, it's pretty nice. If I ever decide to get rid of it, I'll keep you in mind!
Got my hands on the one set I've been lusting after ever since I've gotten into this hobby, **Calm Depths**.\n\nSince I love darker colors, the blues and grays go together amazingly along the white backdrop of my Matrix Abel.\n\n[Here's a quick sound check + typing test I did with this little combination, though I'm trying to not use the set too much just yet. For some reason, the clip will not play on FireFox, so try to use Chrome.](https://puu.sh/upVMH/c8b52e56dc.m4a)\n\nAfter using the Abel, I've noticed that the board really needs a touch up. The switches don't feel lubed or tuned at all, and the stabs are very very bad. Scratchy and they don't hold the spacebar well at all, in comparison to my Octagon with genuine Cherry stabs. I'll have to pass it on to someone experienced to tune up. 
Huh, that's interesting. I just have to wonder how the plate came into play there though, because I very easily just removed the plate, installed the switches directly onto the PCB and every key worked outright. \n\nWish I could try the solder trick, but I don't have any solder tools or experience so I'll pass. I'm sure I'll get this board truly soldered up eventually anyways. 
I'm pretty sure IMSTO has gone off the grid for a while. I know he ran a GB last year that still hasn't been shipped out for whatever reason, last I heard I think he was having family problems, but who knows. \n\nI've heard IMSTO PBTs were amazing, so I want to try them myself, I enjoyed the EnjoyPBT sets, so if these are even better, I WANT THEM.
just linear and tactiles lel, i just don't want to use some non-lubed stuff\n\ni'm kinda picky with my weights tho too

Yeah, I had a set of Jelly POM, the novelty was really in the color, love me some pastels. They were a pretty eh keyset tho
Well, I actually didn't personally install the holtites in the Zeal60, I bought it like that. But when a few fell out, I had to reinstall them, which was easy enough. Just press them into the holes that normally house the switches and you're all set. Just be very careful to not lose them in like carpet, they'll be hard to find. \n\nThey're a nice feature, but the reason I don't like them is because I tried having a plate in this build, but when I used a plate, I couldn't activate the F or J keys, I'm assuming because the contact between the switch and the holtites was shoddy. If I pressed down hard enough, they'd register, but that was a pain. I don't know if that's a universal problem or not, but that pretty much turned me off of holtites for most of my future builds because I very much like having the plate support my switches. 
Ooo Stormtrooper and Red Alert do sound nice. \n\nI'll have to scrounge MM for those...

I didn't think there would be much interest on the ALPS, but if there is enough on it I can definitely get some of those as well.
Pretty sure thats base set? If you add novelties its usually 300 shipped within the states. Unfortunately with us Aussies you need to pay extra on shipping.
Idk I already sold a set previously? You also said i wouldn't sell 9009 and I had quite a lot of offers (which also sold for asking price). So I'm not sure why you need to comment on each of my threads. But I appreciate the input thanks!

Well, I would have preferred the actual Rad-Away colours, but this is kind of reminding me of mint ice-cream (in a good way). I'll keep my order.
OK, those are admittedly fucking gorgeous en masse like that.
JSYK, GMK Hyperfuse has deep-dish homing keys, not bars or bumps.
Holy fuck @ the sample orange alu Clueboard w/ Nuclear Data. Gorgeous.
Hey mate, have had another couple of dudes message me on them before you, will let you know if they fall through.
Was that a Mighty Boosh reference? Thanks for the build log either way.
Just received mine, the Oco order did include the CS:GO-themed doubleshot spacebars.
I did as well.
Ask, man. It doesn't hurt, and may help.
That's pretty fucking glorious. Thanks for the log.
If the PCB has been desoldered properly, the only remaining solder should just be a very thin coating tinning the eyelet...
q.q, chuck me a link anyway, might come back later.
It does somewhat annoy me when GBs are open for less than a month, as not everyone is on a fortnightly pay schedule.
I seem to be getting this on all imgur albums at the moment. I think imgur is maybe just fucked right now.
Heh, saw this and immediately figured it was /u/ca178858's work. Looks great!
Depends on the form factor and price range you want. But generally, some well-regarded commercially available options are: MagicForce 68, Pok3r, basically anything from Filco or Leopold. If you don't like noise you'll want to stick to tactile or linear switches. \n\nThe wiki (see sidebar) has a bunch of good information to help with purchasing decisions, or to at least give you enough knowledge to ask more specific questions.
Thanks for the giant log :>.
If you take a look at the pic, you'll see the PCB contacts are essentially small poles rather than the thin leaves most switches have.
Honestly, HyperFuse looks better in GMK. Unlike, say, Retro.
Oh good. It's after my January paycheck comes in.
And most of the time when it didn't flow properly, it's because the pad wasn't hot enough. Hence, cold joint. The rest of the time, it's usually because there wasn't enough flux (either enough wasn't used, or they burned it all away before sufficiently heating the pad, due to improper technique).
I put this together last year, but never got around to posting the finished board.\n\nFilco Majestouch 1 TKL with Cherry Blue switches (originally), modded thusly:\n\n- Controller: replaced with a [Pegasus Hoof](http://bathroomepiphanies.com/controllers/)\n- Plate: original Filco stainless steel plate sanded & spray-painted lime green\n- Case: Aluminium case from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-Anodized-Aluminum-Case-Shell-For-Filco-87-Tenkeyless-Mechanical-Keyboard-Including-Key-line-separation/32617566709.html)\n- Switches: stickered, spring-swapped to 80g\n- Stabilizers: lubed with GH V3 thick lube\n- Caps: Overcast DSA (kits: Black Alphas, Blindspots, TKL Mods, 1337 Kit Lime)\n- Cable: 6ft Pexon Filco<->USB A cable in [Zombie] Infection with black Techflex sleeving & black heatshrink\n- Artisan: [Rama's Liquid Black Stainless Steel 'X' cap](https://rama.works/store/rama-ss-x-liquid-black-kc-mx). Amazingly thocky, pleasingly shiny, and far less fingerprint-prone than expected.\n\n\nThe case is nearly perfect --- it is incredibly solid, wonderfully heavy, the top/bottom split is only visible from the bottom, and it feels nice both to the touch & to type on. The only problem is that mine came with a [very small flaw on the top/front bezel](https://shados.net/files/filco_envy_flaw.jpg). Honestly, I don't actually notice this in use, and no one I know has noticed it without it being pointed out, but the imperfection does still annoy me.\n\nThe case also comes with a detachable usb cable break-out module, although I'm not using it.
My PCB  was definitely not flashed with the default true fox layout, but the plate isn't warped. It is very easy to flash a new layout to the board (see the build guide). The tolerances on the stabilizer holes are pretty screwed, as mentioned.

You're a maniac. Also, I love the countersunk screw holes. Good job.
No need for apologies, my thanks was genuine. Nice to have a bunch of pictures to go through. Also, reddit mostly just uses Markdown for formatting, so you can do headers if you want, like so:\n\n# Header\n## Smaller Header\n### Even Smaller Header\n    # Header\n    ## Smaller Header\n    ### Even Smaller Header
Does that make your sniffles better or worse?
While JTK have had various molding issues, I don't really see any problems with their legends on standard keys. The geekhack key is a little shoddy though. Unless you mean you don't like the font?\n\nThe whitefox stock caps are downright unpleasant to type on -- the lateral wobble can be felt any time I don't hit a key perfectly on-center, which is really unsettling to me.
Cool log. One thing I would suggest doing in future is testing your PCB before soldering - short the switch holes to check they work, and grab a loose LED to check the LED holes.\n\nThis way, if you do run into issues later, you can be more certain that it is a problem with your soldering or your switches/LEDs, rather than a PCB issue. And if you do find an issue with your PCB, well, at least you learned about it beforehand and don't have to desolder the whole thing :).
The Carbon Add-on drop actually has a spacebar kit w/ correctly-sized spaces, it just hasn't shipped yet. Carbon has pretty insane compatibility across all the drops.
No, but it has beige, not freakin' yellow.
Nail clippers should never work better than a good pair of wire cutters. That's either some very odd nail clippers or some very bad wire cutters you've got.\n\nCool post. Interesting key layout. I've got a small but fading burn scar on one of my fingertips from a soldering incident myself :p.
I like it. The real question is whether you can beat someone to death with it and have it still work after :).
Oh good. I'll have money in January.
If the plate is 1.5mm (+/- 0.1mm) thick and the holes are correctly sized then the switches should 'click' into place, and not come out when removing caps. Well, maybe when removing caps from Cherry Clear stems, as that can take a bit of force, but they shouldn't come out easily. \n\nIf the plate is too thick or thin then they're basically just being held into place by friction, rather than mechanically held by the tabs clips on the housing.\n\nThanks for the build log.
I'm upvoting you solely because of some of the shots backgrounded with the box.
Ah, that's unfortunate, as I'm going to have to wait for R2 if I want to eat this month.
Eh. The variance in thickness is still less than that on the whitefox stock caps, expressed as a relative %. They're no GMK but they're a pretty good first run, and they're also a lot cheaper than GMK. I can definitely see how it could annoy you though.
The spacebar appears to be integrated into the bezel of the case, on its own, with no adjacent keys. Kind of an interesting design ;).
Sounds interesting. Is it just going to be an acrylic layer case, or...?
Thanks for the build log. Those caps look great.
I love your taste in caps, less so in keyboards.
Pretty sure they were left-overs from the whitefox groupbuy cables.
Nice. As an Australian I really appreciate the cheap shipping.
The twist is that your wife is a keyboard, and now she knows you've been cheating on her with a new board?
You don't need a hot air station to use paste, and it's dirt-cheap.
Really nice job with the case, it looks gorgeous.
Wow, that Japanese AEK is pretty cool. I'd buy it, but the price + expected shipping down to Australia would murder my wallet.
Thanks for the lovely, detailed log. 
Same keyboard as in all the Zenith/Heath Z/H-1XX kit computers. Alps SKCC Cream or Tall Cream switches, I forget which. Source: I have one of those keyboards attached to a teensy++ 2 at home. Need to make a wooden case for it.
...Is that blue alps on the last board there? Damn.
I think he's just referring to the second *batch* of R1, as Elton ended up able to offer a second lot of 30 in addition to the initial 30 up for the international GB. It's meant to ship soon. Got my first-batch order already, waiting on Zeal R4 switches and stabs to ship :).
First 30 seconds really confused me, because for a while there your voice sounded exactly like a friend of mine. Cool review, interestingly whacky keyboard. Bondwell seem to do weird multiple-switch-type boards on several of their laptops.
Um, it looks like you wetted the paper on the acrylic for some reason? Don't do that. I'm pretty sure that would only make it more of a PITA to remove.\n\nThanks for the build logs.
Huh. Totally didn't even notice your previous post. I'd be interested, although probably can't bring much in the way of boards due to not driving.
Do you know yet if you can supply the CaraVan in Acid Pink? (Clearly the most crucial of questions :p)
Will the minivan be available in acid pink? I ask because my roadkit should turn up some time soon... although the tracking for that never seems to update q.q.
Scientific computing, and from the multitude of putty windows you're obviously working with stuff on linux servers, but you're running windows locally? Seems like a slightly strange combination.
"The guy I bought it from had a huge stockpile of old apple keyboards."\n\nSay... you wouldn't happen to have his address, would you?
I have done this for my current work board and like it quite a bit (lubed vintage blacks on the mods, ergoclears on the rest).
I'd be down for that.
Looks gorgeous. Thanks for the log :).
[This](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=533298262666&ft=t&toSite=main) should be arriving from taobao to my house... today, probably. I'll let you know how well it works.
I'm surprised to see the underlight come through the keys as well as it does in the first shot. And you went with different row colours for your backlight LEDs? Not sure I'm a fan of that, personally.
Yep, the slits are there to accommodate the stem legs and prevent the stems from rotating around while you work. Although on the board I have, one of them is a little too tight, as the tolerances are pretty narrow for the slits. Only one though :). 
So the price difference between final & the MD GB is all in the caps included with the MD drop? Also, hyped for whenever mine arrives.
Finally, a deity I can connect with.
It's OK, it's not about how long it takes you, it's about how long it lasts.
Ah man, my acid pink roadkit just shipped out. Once it arrives, I need only cross the ocean, break into your house, and steal your caps. Then I can be satisfied.
Dayum. Do want.
I think he might have just meant "comes in *a* clutch" (as in a group), because otherwise the title doesn't make much sense to me either.
From [Taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=533298262666&ft=t&toSite=main).
Noooo will not let you go
If you don't care about destroying the stabs that are there, then yes, you can remove them without desoldering the switches by just snapping the inserted stabs in half. You can then insert new ones normally, as Costar stabilizers are inserted from above the plate.\n\nSomewhat odd that lubing didn't help, though -- are the stabs actually loose in the plate or something?
Where'd you get the stickers?
It came with the kit, so I have no idea what it actually is.
Spacing and character-line-widths on the modifier legends are little spotty, but otherwise those look pretty amazing, and the price is right.
To be fair, this would take maybe an hour for someone with the right skill-set.
That wallpaper would look better with the two halves swapped, IMO. Thanks for the build log.
I visit here primarily for build logs, and secondly for news :). \n\nIn terms of switch capacity: The makers do a smaller version of the modding station but I wanted one that can handle at least a 65% at a time, as doing switch modding in batches is easier, faster, and gives more consistent results.\n\nIn terms of physical space: I would actually like the switch holes to be spread out another mm or two, to give more room to maneuver when placing switch stickers. It's OK as-is though.
You can also just use timer mode to solve that problem.
Heh, this is probably what the original video contents should have been. Although the rambling was a little amusing.
They're definitely perty, but honestly the only ones I actually want are the Lightsaver, the Dolphin, and the Blackbird. And I have the latter :).
"I'm not gonna ramble as much as I already have"
Mm, thanks for the cool log. I did my own og ergodox a few years back using a $10 iron, some ancient 0.2mm solder and SMD diodes, but it's definitely a lot easier to do if you instead use solder paste and a decent iron. The former at least is cheap, too :).
Splendiferous.
The only way I've ever been able to get costar stabs out of a plate safely was with pressure from below while also pushing the sides in, and if he can't desolder then he can't really get at it from below so much. \n\nOf course, this could just be due to having a particularly tight plate or something, as I haven't removed stabs on a bunch of different boards.
...I want the caps from the top board, please.
Haha, not even close. I was just implying that I would go rob their stash :>.
Thanks for the build log. 
And is that ever fucking worth it.
"holtite", not "hotlite". Think "hold tight" and it all makes sense.\n\nEdit: fixed my spelling mistake. Oh, the irony.
Cut a small piece of tape and lay it over the stem-hole, then put the cap back on the switch. Should be nice and tight.
I like them. I was worried they would be a little bit too light and either not return quite properly, or make it too easy to accidentally actuate, or make bottoming out super frequent. \n\nIn reality: They return fine, they don't accidentally actuate just by resting fingers on them, and while I do bottom out on them it's not jarring or painful because the amount of force I'm pressing down with is so low.\n\nI do also like heavier switches though, so I guess I'm just easy when it comes to switch weights :).
/u/mariekirya is that underglow on an OG ErgoDox, or do my eyes deceive me? Also, you're missing an acorn nut on the left unit.
Dude, just wiggle the cap side-to-side as you remove it. I've literally never managed to damage a Cherry Clear switch by removing caps, as long as I wiggle it :).
Ugh, I've been waiting for icon modifiers but they either weren't restocked or sold out already. q.q.
That ISO enter master race sticker infuriates me to a surprising degree. Have an upvote.
If I were in the correct hemisphere I would be all over that :).
Forgot to post this last night. [Here](http://imgur.com/jcguv0C.jpg)'s a crap shot of a disassembled switch in it, works pretty well. The slots for holding stems and springs are really rather convenient, although I think I would have preferred them above the switches rather than beneath.\n\nI have an older switch modding station from the same people that had somewhat inconsistently-sized switch holes, so some rows would grip tighter than others, but they seem to have solved that problem.\n\nThe small holes at the top do work pretty well for paint brushes, but I'll probably need to find some tiny jars or such if I want to fit lube containers in the somewhat larger holes.
Thing with those macro keys is that they are not recognized by the computer as such. So you cannot bind some action in a game to G1, as you said. Does the keyboard not have software to bind it to whatever you want?
This is an insane coincidence. I had the exact same problem with the exact same keyboard yesterday. Here's the solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waaiQwin81o
I don't think so.\n\n\nThe way I used my G-keys was to bind them to key-combinations I'd surely never use elsewhere (ie. CTRL+SHIFT+F12) and then bind actions ingame to it.  
I do have logitechs gaming software installed and yes i can rebind the G keys, but i would have to rebind them to already existing keys which i would like to avoid if i could.
Thank you so much, i dont have time to do it right now but i'll do it tomorrow.
My brother pointed this out to me a few months back.  \nThe official peppa pig channel has over 1.7 million subscribers and all the videos has a ton of views.  \n\nI understand that parents just puts this on for their small kids on repeat etc, but doesnt youtube have a view count limiter so people can't cheat their way to views.  \nThe youtube kids app can be a reason for the views too as mentioned in a comment on this post https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/4mlitn/what_is_up_with_peppa_pigs_view_count/ [**(the comment)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/4mlitn/what_is_up_with_peppa_pigs_view_count/d3wfurz)  \n&nbsp;\n\nBut this still doesnt explain the 1.7 million subscribers
If you pick up moxxi's bad touch yourself on your savefile she wont give it again, you will only get the good touch after that.  \n\nHowever if you have someone else join your game and pick up the bad touch for you, moxxi will keep giving the bad touch first
* you are right about that, but on the other hand if i use my ultimate and noone follows up its wasted  \n\n* i tend to rogue ult without calling it out or looking for combos. I need to get better at that.  \n\n* i see that some of my bubbles are wasted, but most of them are trying to predict/just incase.  \nwhen i have 80+ charge i fully agree that i shield just for the sake of shielding/being capped out on energy (bad habit)\n\n* Its a bad habit to reload constantly i'll try to get better with it.  \n\nSharing my point of view on what i do, not trying to defend myself against your critique.

thanks.  \nI prefer a youtube video.
I thought ult cordination might be the case, thank you for proving my suspicions.  \n\nMost of the critique i have gotten says that i overuse my bubbles at the wrong times, altho i appreciate the critique and agree with them i don't feel that my bubbles are the problem costing me my wins.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTime to start looking for some more Norwegian buddys to que with or work more on my english accent so its easier to communicate in english for ultimate combos

Grinder is kinda out of the meta right now (cause of the nerfed base suit dodge and grinder perk deck nerf) but anyways here we go  \n\nBase skills [max 15 dodge, max 30 crit, good drills](http://pd2skills.com/#/v3/ekL:tKl:ggJKLnpr:ibcdea:pN8:::a1)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Variables:**  \nWeapon mods in links  \n\n[pistol+shotgun](http://pd2weapons.com/l/b0cce913f1d817dd054e132f4c3e5cf6)\n> **Primary:** mosconi (i didn't include ammo type cause i haven't messed around with it to much after the difficulty update)  \n**Secondary:** bronco  \n**Equipment:** doctor bags  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[shotgun only](http://pd2weapons.com/l/8e463f16010346ffb8810a8d7c592e0f)\n> **Primary:** breaker  \n**Secondary:** locomotive  \n**Deployment:** ammo bags  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[smgs and/or assault rifles](http://pd2skills.com/#/v3/mpr:ekLR:tKlMNOqR:gGJKLNpr:ibcdea:pN8:::a1) (24points left i recommend using them on silent killer)\n>Just mod the weapons for concealment  \nIt could be a good idea to have a grenade launcher+smg/assault rifle  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI didn't put too much detail to min maxing on these builds right now but they should do good  \n**Note:** you can of course use whatever weapons you want
1. "i would say that i perform well"  \nThats after my own judgement which cant be 100% trusted cause people like to think they are better than what they are. I wont argue on this without showing off some ranked recordings of my gameplay.\n\n2. "Does anyone have any good tips for rank"  \nCorrection: im asking for tips to improve my rank doesn't matter mentality not how to improve rank, i have basicaly heard all the tips in the book on rank improving.  \n\n3. "I can fill in hero after everyone else have picked"  \nI will still only play the heroes im confident on, but i have a very flexible hero pool.  \n\n4. "I'll play zarya and kill everything"  \nIt is said that a good zarya can carry a game, and since i have specialized in mastering zarya it should be a viable option. And don't underestimate how much DPS a zarya can do even with 50% average charge.
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvF57L6ytZw) should help with tracer aim.  \nAbout your teleports/blinks: I try to often blink straight trough the enemy, and blinking unpredictably.  \nI don't think theres a exact recipie to manage your blinks but always have atleast 1 blink left or recall.  \nAnother tip is to just watch proffesional players play tracer and learn from the gameplay
Claptrap in borderlands 2
As i said im aware that her role isnt main dps like soldier and bastion.  \nBut my point still stands cause most of the time a soldier, bastion or tracer will benefit the team more cause they can kill faster instead of relying on "hack ability" to assist the team.  \n\nIm not calling Sombra useless or not viable on some maps but most of the time (not necessarily always) another hero will benefit the team more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThink about it like:  \nin borderlands 2: 1 grognozzle+interfacer gunzerker, 1 sniper assassin, **1 smg siren**  \nwill benefit the team more than: 1 grognozzle+interfacer gunzerker, 1 sniper assassin, **1 legendary nurse siren**  \nYes it can work just fine with the legendary nurse but the team is more effective with the smg build.  \nJust an example from the top of my head, i know it from a completly different game but the point is the same
I think i found it, thanks.  \nin a older version of wolfhud there was a option to change the hp bar color [(old screenshot from a friend of mine)](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=676152785) if i remember correctly and thats when i first made a sharded folder with my mod collection, since then i have just updated it by copying over my mods.  \n\nSo i found a difference in my shared folder and my own game:  \n\n\nShared folder:\n> Dropbox\\payday 2 uteligger's mod collection\\mod_overrides\\WolfHUD_Textures\\guis\\textures\\pd2\n\ncontains: **hud_health.texture** and **hud_health.texture.old**  \n\nMy game:\n>PAYDAY 2\\assets\\mod_overrides\\WolfHUD_Textures\\guis\\textures\n\ncontains: **contract_vlad.texture**  \n\nSo im just gonna completly overwrite the shared folder now and give him the mods again
You have a point there, altho i don't feel that im stressed when i play i might stress a bit under teamfights and when we are close to overtime
I would just like to say that for professional streamers (very good players) it would be pretty easy to carry in bronze up to around diamond in the matter of hours.  \nThese professional gamers will have more trouble when they close more in on the ELO they belong to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn short: players ELO hell varies on your own skill, if you are a top 500 player your ELO hell would be above diamond somewhere, if you are a diamond player your ELO hell would be in platinum and maybe some in gold.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nbut belive me ELO hell is very real
the first game will do fine
i dont have a good reason for why i do it other than theres nothing better to do while i wait to attack, but i never kill myself like that in competitive
technically no skills are required to do these heists stealth, so is all skills trash to you then?  \nBut how is using stockholm syndrome complicated? You kill the guards silently then you make some noise and everyone is scared to death and you can rob the place in peace.  \nIf you feel that its complicated to keep making noise now and then just kill the civilians after the first time you make noise.  \n\nA bonus on bank heist by using stockholm syndrome: you dont have to focus on killing the bank tellers before they sound the alarm or the civilian in the back that tries to sound the alarm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nits not like the points you spend on stockholm syndrom is better spent somewhere else anyways.  \n[This is a perfect stealth build, theres no other stealth relevant skills to spec into](http://pd2skills.com/#/v3/mhjl:eklQr:tCefHIKL:gABCDEFjklPr:ibcdea:pB8:::)  not counting other perk decks like yakua or anarchist for movement speed, just the old burglar perk deck.
This isnt exactly the answer you where looking for but i'll leave it anyways :)  \n\nI would actually recommend soloing safehouse nightmare with no bots (no bots cause cloackers don't jump at you)  \n\nJust do as Kins0 did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy3S3jQqy5E  \n**Important:** if the drill doesn't get autorestart just restart the heist until you get it.  \n\nI got my nightmare safehouse achivements like this and im guessing its easier this way than with a 4 man crew
I guess you could shoot them in the kneecaps like john reese in person of interest
Yes you can join someone else to pick up the bad touch in their game. They will still keep getting it the first time as long as they dont pick it up themselves when they are host.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPerfect parted lvl 72: [Bad touch](http://thegearcalculator.appspot.com/calc?gear=gAv0pn048LY0BA0vn0Gj0tr0x60xc0XG0), [Good touch](http://thegearcalculator.appspot.com/calc?gear=gWk0pn048LY05q0vn0Gj0tr0yP0xc0IY0)  \nBoth the bad touch and the good touch are equally good for Maya, just switch between them depending on if the enemies have armor.  \n>a small tip incase you didnt know: armored lunatics/maniacs/psychos take full damage from headshots with fire elemental even tho they have armor.\n\nIf you want a good shock smg too i would recommend the [Florentine](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Florentine) (it got both slag and shock in 1)  \nThere are of course still better options out there like the [Sandhawk](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Sand_Hawk) but the good and bad touch are more than good enough.
i guess i can do that, i have tought about it before, its just that its more job and stuff
4 min on symmetra, i despise her cause her weapon requires no skill at all to deal damage
yes you both need the mod.  \nIt only fixes desync for the person that has the mod installed (does not fix it for the whole lobby)

I would say im one of the people with the most Game/map awareness in EU because when i fancy a game i tend to learn everything about it.  \n\nYou could ask me anything about **payday 2**, **borderlands 2**, **the binding of isaac afterbirth**, **terraria pre 2016 updates**, **minecraft pre 2016 updates**. (relevant to gameplay of course)  \nMosy likely i will have a good answer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI started working on my aim a few months ago: lowerd my DPI, i got a good mouse **G502**, a good mousepad **G640** and a new bigger main screen.  \nimproving my aim: i always start with warming up in practice range till i hit/kill the bots reliably.  \ni warm up with:\n>mccree, soldier, tracer, pharah, widowmaker, genji.\n\nI also warm up/practice with mccree vs ana bots headshots only.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI keep trying to communicate (i know i could do better but my accent is kinda limiting me) I do callout ultimate combos and flankers tho.  \n\nI do play hard (perform the best i can) I usually stop playing overwatch for the rest of the day if i lose 2 times in a row and lose a lot a rating.  \nTheres no point in continuing playing if im tilted cause people tend to perform worse when they are tilted.
Im 3 months late for this post but here goes.  \n\nYou could download voicemeeter and hear your own voice trough that.  \n\nThis is what i do when i play online games where i need to communicate to make sure my speech is on point, even tho i hate hearing my own voice.
my sens is at 6.4 ingame 700 dpi, mouse acceleration off, default surface setting in LGS  \nI use: "Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum RGB tunable gaming mouse" and "Gaming Mouse Pad - Cloth Surface - G240 - Logitech"\n\nTvique's (one of the best overwatch players) sens is at 7 ingame 800 dpi

i used to play at 30+ ingame and 1700 dpi, now it play at 6,40 ingame 600-700 dpi (i still need to find my sweet spot for consistent perfect aim) it felt to slow in the start but i have gotten used to it  \n\nAnyways why low sens is recommended: its way easier to have precise aim, you actually still got good reacton time and the time to turn around if there is a enemy behind you etc (with higher sens it can be faster to turn around yes but your precision might not be good enough.  \n\nNotes: most pro player play with a low sens but there are those few people who play with a higher sens too.
Why do you call me a cunt and tell me to go kill myself when i asked you nicely to switch from symmetra to something more usefull in koth.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy do i always get junkrat mains on my team in competitive?  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy do my teammates completly give up when 1 teammate \nleaves, i know it was 5v6 but still we could maybe have done it with 3 tanks and 2 healers (ana, lucio), but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that they made fun of my accent/speech when i asked them why they didn't just listen to me and picked tanks and healers.

The thing with having a fun premade is that my friends are eighter busy when i have time to play or they are limited to specific heroes for max performance.  \n\nI prefer speaking in my native language cause of accent, i will speak english if i have to tho (like callout in voice chat).  \n\nI have tried finding fun people who speakes my native language but again they end up being busy.

what builds and weapons are you using?  \n&nbsp;\n\nI have mostly used **plainsrider bow** as primary and **chinapuff** as secondary with **rogue/crook** 55/44 dodge and **hostage taker** for hp regen  \n[crook medic version, 45 dodge 100+ armor](http://pd2skills.com/#/v3/mACDfGIJKl:egIJkL:tKl:ggJKLnpr:ibcdea:pO8:::a3) **-** [rogue ammo version, 55 dodge](http://pd2skills.com/#/v3/mfGIJKL:ekLMNoR:tKl:gGJKLNpr:fr:ibcdea:pR8:::a1)  \nconcealment 6-7 everything modded for max concealment and i have a concealment skin for the bow  \nFor me mayhem and deathwish has been pretty easy even solo  \nNote: i have been running with these builds pre update to, i called it the hanzo build  \n&nbsp;\n\ni havent had to much time to tinker about with my other old/new builds yet  \ni did make a rust dedicated build and tried that out yesterday tho (solo mayhem)  \nhttp://pd2skills.com/#/v3/mr:eaDEFGhIjkLMNoR:tKlNqR:gJlpr:fQr:ibcdea:::a7  \n**primary:** Breaker 12G **secondary:** CR 805B **throwable:** throwing axe **melee:** Chain Whip **perk deck:** biker  \ni did have more trouble with that build, nothing to deal with shields, not good ammo pickup, couldnt run out in the open, health/shields was fine as long as i didnt run out like a headless chicken  \n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR: i find mayhem and deathwish easy and feel that you just need the right build  \nedit: value on rogue dodge from 54 to 55
i see, thank you for the context
try playing overwatch in borderless windowed mode.  \n\ni can't play in fullscreen anymore cause there's a bug in the game that makes it not utilize my CPU and GPU so i get 7 fps,  \nit really sucks cause we get more input lag when its not in fullscreen mode
I disagree with that statement.  \nIn my opinion a player can master several heroes even if his hero pool is very flexible/large.  \nJack of all trades and master of some.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nsome examples of jack of all trades/flex players:  \nJudging from streams not their roles in Esports\n>Tvique  \nIDDQD  \nShadder2k  \nSoon  \nValkia (master on pharah and good with everything else he plays)  \nSter  \nKryw  \nKruise\n\nBasically every pro player out there.  \n\nDisclaimer: im not saying that im as good as these players not by a longshot but the point still stands.  \n\nMy master hero is zarya and i would say im good with everything else i play in competitive
How can you say that im by no means good when you havent seen me play or anything? its like saying "i havent seen x movie but i know its terrible" (probably because it wasnt rated 4-5/5 or 8-10/10)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI havent said anything about what my SR is on this post but its irrelevant anyways cause what im after is tips to improve rank doesnt matter mentality. (tips on how to not give a sh*t about my SR)  \n\nI dont need comments that says git gud or you basically suck
are you using any mods?
they eighter got a life or lost their life
Funeral cause you can spell it without fun
So have noone here like heard of adblock before?
First off i'll say that i dont agree with your logic and i'll explain why using stockholm syndrome is good in stealth (kinda explain).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLets say you play bank heist stealth  \n**Loadout:** Saw, silenced gruber, 2x ecm, 1 ammo bag  \n**Note:** the saw intimidates civilians just like a loud gun  \n\nThere are only 4 guards and no civilians out of range to intimidate (if you move around a bit)  \n\n1. Start by killing the cam guard, then you kill the 2-3 other guards  \n2. When they are all dead or theres only 1 guard left you place a ecm and start sawing in the air (to intimidate civilians)  \n3. Kill the last guard if you didnt kill him already  \n4. Use cable ties, place drill, start killing civilians you dont have cable ties for (last one is optional)  \n5. ecm timer has run out, Answer the last pager if you didnt deal with all the guards before the ecm rush  \n6. wait for the drill to finish and loot the place  \nNote: civilians stop spawning after 5-7 minutes, if theres any civilians that have spawned in on the street that gets alerted just saw in the air, honestly you probably dont even need the ecm (depending on how fast you kill the last guard)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDiamond store, jewlery store  \n2-4 guards on these heists  \n\n1. Go behind and take out the cams  \n2. Kill remaining guards  \n3. Intimidate civilians with loud weapons  \n4. Cable tie or kill or do whatever  \n5. Loot the place\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGo bank  \nLets say you are playing with 3 other people  \nPlayer 1: saw, silenced gruber, 2x ecm, 1 ammo bag  \nPlayer 2-4: any loud weapon, silenced gruber, 2x body bags, 1 ecm  \n\n1. Go behind the bank and kill any guards that goes out back  \n2. ecm rush, kill guards, intimidate civilians, shoot the cams, cable tie/kill civilians  \n3. Answer pager, find keycards  \n4. Eighter body bag people on the street, kill any new spawning civilians or intimidate any new spawning civilians  \n5. Wait for timelock and guard the phone  \n6. Kill the 2 gensec control guards  \n7. Loot the vault\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo please tell me again why stockholm syndrome is a quote: "trash skill"  \n\nAs for stockholm syndrome loud:  \n**Basic:** Civilians are intimidated by the noise you make and remain intimitdated 50% longer.  \n\nWhy would you get this skill? its basicaly useless, intimidated civilians will still flee if they get rescued, if you need hostages just dominate some cops (dont bother with tying down civilans they are in limited numbers, cops are not)  \n\n**Aced:** Your hostages will not flee when they have been rescued by law enforcers. Whenever you get into custody, your hostages will trade themselves for your safe return. This effect can occur during assaults, but only 1 time during a heist.  \n\nThis actually gives the skill a purpose in loud, 1 get out of jail free card, and it works with dominated cops as well as tied down civilians  \n\nIf you want i can make some videos to show how effective stockholm syndrome is on the heists mentioned.
**ALL I WANT IS MERCYS WITCH SKIN** please blizzard give it to me i don't wanna have to spend 3000 coins on it
Here is how i would do it:  \nhttp://bl2skills.com/siren.html#555051050045050100003550510511  \nFor this build i would have a rough rider for moving fast, bee shield for dmg, and any other good shield for survivability, legendary cat classmod, a lvl 50 blue banshee classmod with +6 on fleet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd i would recommend never speccing into sub sequence, its not worth it
SO I WAS PLAYING A SOLO QUE COMPETITIVE THE OTHER DAY ON ROUTE 66 WE GOT A FULL HOLD ON DEFENSE (THE OTHER TEAM DIDNT EVEN GET THE FIRST CHECK POINT, they werent even any good)  \n\nit should be easy to win on attack there right? **GUESS WHAT MY TEAM LOST**, I MEAN WTF  \nALL WE HAD TO DO WAS PUSH THE PAYLOAD 20 METERS, MY TEAM DIED LEFT AND RIGHT TO BASICLY NOTHING, THEY DIDNT DEAL DAMAGE FOR SHIT AND WASTED ALL OUR TIME AND THEN WE **FUCKING LOST**  \n\ni only lost like 20 points and fair enough you win some you lose some in competitive but when my team couldnt even get past the other team when we full held it with no effort requierd **I GET SERIOUSLY PISSED OFF**  \n&nbsp;\n\nso please for the love of god don't just think you get a free win when you full hold on defense, you still gotta put in **some effort** on attack
I often try to predict incoming damage with my shields or use it them just incase of incoming damage.  \n\nI should get better at utilizing my shields, i focus a bit much on damage but i also feel that if i dont constantly deal the damage we wont have enough dps to kill stuff
you should start with a fresh install of the game/verify game files from steam
it should be easy with a **Thanatos .50 cal** 3000 damage and shield penetrating (well looking past them running at you and instakilling you)
yes relics of the ancients are very common from loot midgets, they will drop legendarys too eventually its all rng dependant

Oh my favorite, time for more complaining  \n&nbsp;\n\nWHY DO I ALWAYS HEAR THAT IF YOU GET A PICK YOU HAVE BASICLY WON THE TEAM FIGHT BUT MY TEAM ALWAYS LOSE (edit: almost always lose)  \n&nbsp;\n\nWHY THE FUCK DOES IT TAKE 5 YEARS FOR ME AND MY TEAM TO RESPAWN ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE DEFENDING BUT THE ENEMY TEAM INSTANTLY RESPAWNS  \n&nbsp;\n\nHOW THE FUCK CAN A SINGLE ULTING ZENYATTA STALL OUT THE TIME ENOUGH FOR THE ENEMY TEAM TO COME BACK AND THEN WIPE US ALL OUT WITHOUT ANY OTHER ULTIMATES, I MEAN WTF  \n&nbsp;\n\nWHY THE FUCK DO MY TEAM ALLOW THE ENEMY TO PUSH ALL THE WAY TO OUR SPAWN WHEN WE ARE ON ATTACK/KOTH  \n&nbsp;\n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL **WHY THE FUCK ISNT THE FULLSCREEN LOW FPS BUG FIXED** WHEN I PLAY IN FULLSCREEN I GET 7 FPS (I SHOULD GET 100+ AND CHANGING THE SETTINGS HAS NO EFFECT) **OVERWATCH DOESN'T EVEN UTILIZE MY GPU/CPU WHEN IN FULLSCREEN MODE**  \nIT WORKS FINE IN BORDERLESS WINDOWED MODE THO, BUT THE INPUT LAG FUCKS WITH MY AIM (just slightly not to major, butt still i would like less input lag)
I wanna be a good Mccree but my aim is always off by a few mm.\n  \nNote: my Soldier 76 is just fine, and all other hitscan heroes and heroes in general  \n\nEdit: Im guessing that my biggest issue here is that im burned out from not enough sleep have peak performance
oh okay, thanks
FUCK JUNKRATS TRAP, IM 2+ METERS AWAY FROM IT AND IT JUST BITES ME.  \nI MEAN WTF I DIDNT STEP IN IT AT ALL SO WHY THE FUCK DOES IT BITE ME
i see you have gotten some good tips here but it doesn't hurt with some more.  \nYou should watch [this guide on tracer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvF57L6ytZw), it teaches focus fire and accuracy.  \nThis is also my first warmup stage to make sure my accuracy is in place before i start playing quick play/competitive
when you say it like that i kinda loses all its magic
it doesn't boost the dmg of the rip tire but you used to get kill assists before, im not sure if that is patched or not now cause i havent boosted junkrats that use their riptire since i learned about this
I would recommend getting wolfhud over pocohud.  \nThe icons in the middle of the screen is in wolfhud at least, but i dont think op is using wolfhud cause the rest of the visible hud isnt the same.  \n  \nWolfhud adds almost everything you would want from a hud in my opinion :)
The best way to counter Mei would be a long range hero like: Widowmaker, Ana, Hanzo, Mccree, a better Mei, Junkrat can also potentially work  \nAlso never go 1v1 against a mei in close combat (unless you are Mei yourself)
great, vid 2 is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef6dZnCsLLk)
a lot of people recommend the **pistol crossbow** but i dont agree (if you have explosive ammo on it you are limiting your ammo, and otherwise it only deals 750x2 dmg **currently deals x2 damage due to a bug** im guessing the bug will be patched soon)  \n&nbsp;\n\nI would go with **china puff grenade launcher** (infinite ammo in the long run, 1500 AOE damage, not bad ammo pickup and 100% self sustaining ammo if you have fully loaded aced)  \n&nbsp;\n\nI know you didnt ask for primary weapon but i'll list it anyways  \n\n**Planerider bow or light crossbow** not explosive (1500 damage + headshot multiplier, ammo isnt a problem cause you pick up 95% of the arrows)  \n**Thanatos .50 cal** (3000 damage, not the best ammo pickup but you will manage with the **china puff** when you are running low on ammo)
Hopefully the driver of the car im sitting in would notice it very fast, or if he is the cause that i die right now im guessing a long time depending on how well he hides my body
Im fully aware of the bad ultimate at 5:55 (no callout and teammates dead)  \nI was already about to use it when my teammates died, to late to save it
can we get some more context, like rank, when they left (they have to atleast have stayed in the game for 31 sec from match start otherwise it would just have voided the match), why the enemy team defended right outside your spawn, how your team didn't manage to push the payload more than 3 meters
First of all have good routines:  \nEat regular meals and never game on a empty stomach, have a consistent sleep schedule with enough sleep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHave a good mousepad and mouse, and make sure too find a suitable DPI for you, lowering it is often good, I went from 1700 DPI 15+ ingame to 600 DPI 3,40 ingame (5 ingame on pharah).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWarm up before playing against others, i myself always warm up in practice range with soldier, mccree, tracer, widowmaker and pharah and i don't play with others untill i see that my aim is accurate and consistent on the training bots.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt could be a good idea to play without sleeves on your armes, in my experience i feel that sleeves is in the way for my hands when moving my mouse.
You have to bind "i need healing to a key", using the emote wheel doesn't work. i think its bound to **X** by default  \n\nJust press **X** while looking at a teammate
my main loud build is definitely DW viable, did the biker heist with it had 0 downs, my teammates on the other hand...well we don't talk about that :P  \n\nheavy shotgun build is DW viable but it can be a bit hard to recover HP sometimes  \n\nmy favorite pistol build is DW viable just dont take to high risks, you only got 25 dodge  \n\nshotgun dodge build is also DW viable, still dont take to high risks  \n\ni havent used the crit flamethrower build since the skilltree revamp open beta so it will need some tweaking for DW  \n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want i can make you a good DW build, just tell me the weapons you wanna use and if you want dodge or armor
Im gonna keep playing some on NA to see if my luck keeps going there.  \nI really feel like i can win alot more there
cops can shoot your projectiles to blow them up early.  \nIf you are playing on mayhem and above its most likely due to the cops being more aggressive
I switched to tracer (from zarya) to contest the cart.  \n\nTeammate: we need a second tank, why did you go tracer.  \nMe: i switched to contest the cart.  \nTeammate: WHY SWITCH TO TRACER SHE GOT 150 HP WE NEED A TANK TO CONTEST.
Im in ELO hell myself, stuck in platinum 27xx. I know that my own individual skill and game sens is above Diamond.  \n\nI feel that nomatter what i do i can't rank up like if the system is rigged to not let me pass platinum. Or RNGJesus hates me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have decent aim, good position, good game sens and i fill positions that need filling. I would say im doing my job.  \nI often try to lead a bit by saying when to engage, fallback, focus fire etc. I can provide proof if you want :)  \n\nBut still i always end up losing more games than i win and i can't seem to get higher than 4 win streak.  \nqueing with other good people doesnt seem to help eighter. Duo and trio que.  \n\nI feel that the only reliable way i can rank up is by getting a good permanent 6 stack with good synergi and practise together.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: note im not trying to say that im way better than everyone else i make mistakes too, but my teams are way to random. I have even gotten better at being positive and saying to myself that my team could win just fine without me.
the closest hud is gaige hud but its outdated and isnt supported anymore, if you experience crashes with wolfhud try a fresh instal of the game and add in wolf hud
2 shots break the faceplate 1 shot got guaranteed headshot multiplier bonus
third game is finished uploading [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih3R0HftvR8) it was horrible (i should have asked the 4 stack to join voice chat but i doubt that i would win it anyways)
About the music: i have it low enough for it to not distract me or fade out ingame footsteps/sounds, but i get your point.  \n\nYou are very right about shielding d'va less and squishy targets more for teamplay,  \nbut if we look at it from my point of view i often shield d.va for charge and she was often tanking more damage than any other teammate.  \n\nRegrouping: i'll take note of your advice and be more strict about regrouping, no more shielding rogue players if they refuse to group up.  \n\nUltimate usage: good point.  \n\nI hope my reply to your critique is good and not to defensively like "im the best player and dont do anything wrong"
i dont know about you but i can hit the bulldozers in their faceplate consistently even trough a shield, max 3 shots to kill 1 bulldozer
Im dont know if i would call it a bug but here goes.  \n\n**Title:** No loot dropoff in escape phase  \n\n**Screenshot** -  \n\n**Difficulty:** overkill (just to try out the new heist before i call it a day)  \n\nAfter the train phase you come across 6 warheads and a toast which you can bag and take with you, but theres no loot dropoff by the escape. The escape is basically like in mallcrasher no loot dropoff, and theres to many bags for 4 players to loot by carrying them while stepping in the escape zone.  \n\nEdit: formatting (typed this comment on mobile)
You can add them to your wish list on steam and get a mail when they are on sale
I had the same issue as you when i used logitechs cloth preset in lgs.  \n\nThe solution i found was to use the default preset instead of cloth.
okay thanks, i'll link it there once youtube lets my videos finish uploading
I would say that i try to contribute as a teamplayer, i dont focus on gold medals or on fire to find out how well im doing, well who knows maybe i think im doing way better than i actually am.\n\nMy most favored heroes at this time are zarya, d.va, soldier and mccree. i do switch up to another hero if i feel that i can do more on another hero.  \nI would say that i am very flexible to with my hero pool, i can play everything pretty well so i can contribute with whatevers needed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\ncommon problems i have when playing: (not counting obvious trolls)  \n>I say fall back and dont peak, or die on point. (to sync deaths when the fight is lost) nobody listens.  \n\n>I go in the frontline as Zarya/D.va as im supposed to do (not overextending) and my whole team just dies around me for no reason whatsoever.  \n\n>Nobody seems to know how to counter symmettra, and theres not much i can do when the whole enemy team focuses me down if i try to kill symmettra.  \n\n>3-4 teammates dies in 1 enemy ultimate.  \n\n>My team are close to winning a teamfight we have 6 people left and the enemy team have 3-4 left then suddenly 3-5 of my teammates just dies.\n\nProbably something im doing wrong tho since my teammates keep dying around me and i still live the longest.
i use short crosshairs for all heroes except for "hanzo, mccree, mercy, genji, mei, torbjörn, zenyatta" i use dot for those heroes  \n  \nNo bloom on any heroes
I replaced all the mods on my brothers pc yesterday evening with completly up to date versions from my gamefiles and it works/looks just as flawlessly and good as on my pc
i would recommend getting [BuilDB](http://lastbullet.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=13435)  \ninfinite builds, export option to http://pd2skills.com, name builds whatever you want  \n&nbsp;\n\nIt technically edits your current equipped build.  \nJust remember to equip the right perkdeck too before you save a build to file to prevent the hassle of changing the perk deck every time you wanna use that build
It says right on it that it's KBC keycaps.\n\nThe description doesn't come right out and say it but I assume it's used. Keep in mind AliExpress is basically Amazon or eBay in China - it's not just companies selling new or GB stuff. People can one-off on there too.
you will need some serious luck to get enough coins for the Mercy skin with only 1-2 hours invested per day.  \nSo in theory yes its doable but in practice most likely not **(with coins)**  \n&nbsp;\n\nYou can get it in a loot box.  \n&nbsp;\n\nI feel like legendary droprates are a bit increased during events (might just be me tho)  \nYes i think its doable to get it
So im not alone in feeling that my coverted cops have like 10 hp, i tought maybe one of my mods had bugged after one of the updates.  \n\nI have read trough the comments here and it seems to be a bug with "Partners in Crime aced" (not related to any of my mods)  \nThank you /u/Salem33 for explaining the bug
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIT GUILTY IN THAT MATCH TOO, I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE PLAYED SOMETHING ELSE THAN ZARYA ON ATTACK SINCE IT WASENT WORKING.  \n\nMAYBE TRACER, MEI OR PHARAH BUT STILL THE OTHER TEAM SUCKED AND MY TEAM SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE (me included)
Note: im stuck in platinum and more often than not i lose instead of winning, so i need help to figure out what im doing wrong
zenyatta does not have falloff damage
my game has never crashed cause of wolf hud.  \ni used to have gaige hud before i knew of wolfhud and crashed a lot cause its outdated
I dont hate Sombra at all, i actually really like her but she is a bit underpowered (except for her ultimate IF someone follows up, and her wallhack on low hp enemies is nice too)  \n\nThe thing is that Sombra is outclassed by soldier, and bastion recon mode after next patch (accuracy + damage) tracer and genji for flanking.  \n\nyes i know shes not the main source of damage but still most of the time a soldier or tracer will be more beneficial.    \nThis is my opinion\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote: if someone goes sombra in competitive i let them play her without complaining even tho i know she is outclassed by other heroes.
Hold down space/(jump button)
The best solution for now would be to install [VELOSync](http://lastbullet.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=15451) mod.  \nIt fixes p2p desync like player position (client side), it might fix some other less noticable desync problems to.  \nI don't think it helps to much with stuff like guards spotting you tho, not that i ever play stealth of host
After doing a bit of research, I discovered this utility called Xcam. It's basically an ArmA addon that allows you to place and modify buildings and objects like trees and bushes in a terrain, then you can export it to Terrain Builder.
I used the selection tool and fill for the mask, but I added a Gaussian blur afterwords, as in [this video](https://youtu.be/P1ki5rVCrNA?t=842) he explains that adding a gausian blur can make a smoother transition between the two textures. The first time I made a map I blurred the mask and it turned out just fine, but I was only using 2 colors. \n\nMy surface mask, satellite image, and .xyz height map are at E200000 N0, and both my surface mask, height map, and satellite are 10240x10240.\n\nThe Satellite and mask are originally 16384x16384, but I downscaled them in the Terrain builder as it appeared that it would not line up correctly

I don't want to tell you your business *but*\n\nYou should be building yourself internal mailing lists on your preordered/GB products. Ideally it would be a part of your electronic sales platform.\n\nYour first line of communication should be directly with your customers. Send us an e-mail. Simple, straightforward, and easy to manage.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to be trolling your posts on Reddit and GH to figure out when their purchases are landing.

I'd definitely be interested in the group buy.
Right. I was hoping to get some help getting them out. It seems you need to take the fuse box part way apart to remove them.
I think you're right on the money, and I'm glad to see AMD swinging for the fences again. I remember my first slot A board, which was shipped without branding so that the OEMs wouldn't feel Intel's wrath.\n\nCPU power has stagnated since Sandy Bridge because Intel hasn't had effective competition. It's time for that to change.

Worth noting that KeyClack is (likely) going to run a group buy - GMK Mute - which will have an add-on 9009 kit that would give you the missing numpad enter in red and green.
You sure you didn't get Cherry POM WoB? True Abs doubleshots I find to be indistinguishable.\n\nDue to age and whatnot, most POM Won keycaps I see look almost gray. For reference, look at my profile: I recently put a set of WoB up in r/mm.

I and I think most people would take "balance out kit discrepancies" to mean base for base and kit for kit.\n\nI can go buy Hydro today for $180 brand new. You can get at least $250 for base 9009, maybe $300.

Kinda sucks that you went from $40 to $70, but I might still be interested after I see pics. Depends on whether the bottom row is standard layout or not.
You mean flash it for the first time? You have to hit the reset button. The default keymap I put on the QMK tree will reset to bootloader if you hold . and press +.
You want to take a look at it while you're here?

No, I'd work with you on price a little bit but $100 is way too low.

If you're building with Cherry switches, make sure you get a V1 compatible case, and don't put a pin on reset, it'll work fine.
Keep in mind, that board only has two unique control LEDs (caps lock and num lock) and the rest are one large matrix.\n\nYou could jumper from adjacent LEDs if you want.

No idea. Even if you get it to overclock like that, it may cause frame-skipping.
Not soldered might not be good enough. It could still be making contact. Best to desolder or cut the pin.\n\nIf that doesn't cure it, make sure you're ready to tickle the serial port at the right time. Arduino IDE helps with that.\n\nPersonally, I think the bootloader on these is junk and flash all of mine to DFU.
Sounds good. Something you'll announce in newsletter?

If superglue binds to the type of plastic your switch is made out of (it clearly does), you're going to have to destroy the switch removing it. Anything that would break down the glue would also break down the acrylic.\n\nI'd take a pair of side cuts and start trimming from the top down until I could get the cover off. Once I had the cover out of the way I'd start by cutting off the contact tabs inside the switch. Then I'd start trimming down and try to get the switch housing separated from the acrylic without cracking the acrylic. Use a razor to clean the edge of the acrylic without cutting into it.\n\nDon't try to glue this one back in. You're just going to have to rely on the rest of the switches providing enough support.
Pmed. What part of Ohio? Might be able to FTF
Some monitors IE LG will enable FreeSync with nVidia cards and expose their top frequency via DCC. For instance, with FreeSync on I'm able to set my 34um57 to 75Hz on my 980ti.\n\nWith FreeSync off, it reports a top frequency of 60Hz.

Any hints on the GMK kit referenced in the update?
If your hand is that steady, more power to you. To me, freehanding on a keycap sounds about impossible.
Why would you need the pin to short the pro micro? Just cover the pad with solder.\n\nArduino IDE is a programming environment and flashing tool for Arduino devices. These Pro Micro clones are running an Arduino bootloader and it does the serial timing correctly to flash properly, assuming you time the two resets right.\n\nDFU is the bootloader most other ATmega32u4 based devices ship with. You don't have to mess around with serial ports and that nonsense with it.\n\nDownside is you need a USBisp programmer to flash them.
>Yes, there is a GH60 Satan with an RGB PCB. So, with individual RGB key lighting per switch.\n\nI think the piece of the puzzle you're missing is that these Chinese factories do two things that really mess up the way we do things:\n\n* Use common English words as marketing buzz words. Eg GH60. There are at least half a dozen GH60 boards from China I'm aware of, none of which are affiliated with GeekHack.\n* Change fundamental parts of the PCB without any notice that a change was made.\n\nSatan GH60 (single color LED) works because someone determined that the board had a supportable MCU and a bootloader we could work with, sat down and took the time to map the matrix - probably with a multimeter.\n\nAssuming your board could clear those first two hurdles (MCU and accessible bootloader) someone could probably take care of #3. If your board is that red with white legend depicted in the linked thread though I think you'll find its not flashable.\n\nA word of wisdom: don't assume boards are flashable. Unless someone specifically tells you it's flashable, assume it isn't. Flashable boards are by far the minority.
F and p are in different locations on each board? 
>Can you please point to the law(s) that require universities to report the immigration status of their students? \n\nIt may not be a law per se but instead a condition of accepting federal Perkins and Pell dollars.\n\nUncle Sam uses federal services to regulate all sorts of industries without relying on codified USC. For instance, banks and FDIC.
Ive been thinking about creating a separate keymap for that so that it auto generates.\n\nWhen you were setting up, what would've made sense to you? Rev2-serial-fliphalf? I'm not sure how to simply describe one half being upside down.
* V1 and V2 have different pin assignments.\n* V2 allows for building on either side of the plate. This also allows for Alps switch support because of the longer switch openings.\n* V2 optionally supports I2C instead of serial.\n* V2 has holes drilled to support mounting top and bottom plate in middle of PCB instead of outside edges.\n* V1 mistakenly connected reset pin to something, so when you're building you have to omit the reset pin or you won't be able to reset the Pro Micro.  
Confirmed
Never got it working right. I suspected that the bootloader was corrupting the RGB data somehow but never experimented to see if that was the real issue.\n\nBasically, I couldn't account for why it wasn't working. Everything about it was no different than any other keyboard I RGB modded except for that Mass Storage bootloader.
>I'm sure there is better out there, but at what cost? Often, as much or more than my entire system, for just the headphones.\n\nI think especially the Gustard H10 or the Jot are not unreasonably priced. H10 is ~$300 and one of the best single ended amps you can lay your hands on for under $1,000. The Jot at $500 with both outs and a DAC is a tremendous bargain as well.\n\n* HD650 reterminated to XLR\n* Jot\n* Pair LSR305\n* 2- 3 pin XLR cables\n\nIs shockingly good hardware for just a touch over a grand.

For part of it. Intel didn't really start taking strides back until the Core/Core 2 architecture. It took them a long time to give up on NetBurst.

I think Tai-hao is pretty rough. The only other PBT keycaps I've come across are stock Pok3r keycaps and stock Realforce keycaps.
So you like it rough 😎
The varmillo ones are really nice. They have a nice grit to em. I think PBT DSA feels rougher to me, but both are very nice. 
Yah the dsa from pmk has a nice texture. Varmillo has a nice texture too, but I think it's a little smoother
http://imsto.cn/index.php?route=product/product&path=62&product_id=111
Like other people have said already, Varmilos are really rough and i love it. Their SS2 profile is really nice aswell, atleast i like it coming from OEM.
I believe DSA would be pretty rough as well.\n\nThough in terms of more common profiles I think gateron (enjoypbt) is pretty rough, haven't had a chance to try out varmilo yet. Vortex on the other hand has very smooth PBT.
i concur, they're definitely far from smooth

He also checked the repair department, thought he might have found it (similar color motherboard) and had the guy uninstall from the computer it was test benching and give it to me before we realized that it was actually a slightly different model (mATX instead of mITX).

you think that most games in silver have comms?
afaik, you can't directly compare clock speeds between Intel and AMD because they use different instruction set architectures, so each instruction accomplishes a different set of work each cycle, so clock speed between them isn't actually a useful comparison, only comparing clock speeds between different Intel CPUs or between different AMD CPUs yields a fair comparison because they internally use the same ISAs.\n\nTL;DR: Intel and AMD use different ISAs afaik so comparing their clock speeds is like comparing apples to oranges
No, I think it's all manual..
ya, the lack of obvious awping sounds and people deaths makes it hard to see the kills other than by really looking. I guarantee if someone had never seen where the 4 frags where, they would have no idea where to look.
except 400 is pretty puny. That's literally a tenth of the attendance of the Atlanta major, which on a team basis was the same level of competition. And the prize pool was still nearly half a mil. And people complained of the Atlanta major being too small (and I would agree too, because I was there, Columbus was much better crowd wise).\n\nBut for ELeague, they didn't have a whole lot of choice. It was either pick out this small-ish venue that is Fox which you think you could probably fill to capacity, or pick out one of the big stadiums and dish out a hell of a lot more money (Fox is actually affordable for smaller events, while the big stadiums aren't really) with no guarantee you're even going to get more attendance than at Fox. Note that while tickets did sell out, they didn't sell out until literally less than a week before the major was going to start. There is almost no way they would have filled a stadium.
The point is you're ready to play, as soon as warmup is over. Why do they make you move during warmup? The warmup in the game is absolutely pointless. It's not the game's fault I decided to do nothing during warmup, but it is the game's fault that I'm kicked for doing nothing during warmup. It's fucking warmup for god's sake. It's not the match. I leave sound on and then go browse the reddits until I hear the 3 second start timer, then get back in, to find I get kicked as soon as the 3 second timer ends for whatever stupid reason.
results?
I think it was a cool idea, but it needs more obvious indicators when the awp is shooting. People just kind of fall down. No sound when shooting.

I have a royal kludge rg928 (https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1521) with greetech browns instead of kailh browns (which imo feel really good too).

I wish I could say the same. I now have the windows update service disabled just so I don't crash. Before that, every 2 hours, windows update would try to install an update and it would crash my computer. But having it disabled also means I can't install certain things without re-enabling it when I need it. It wasn't designed to be disabled.
Also notable tho is you need to flash the BIOS for Z170 boards to run kaby lake which means you need access to a Skylake CPU to flash with. I was able to help my friend do it because I have a g4400 so it worked out but not everyone has that

Wait...how do you pronounce lol to rhyme with goals
You do get kicked for sitting still in warmup. It's stupid as shit. If the warmup goes for the full time (because someone didn't connect until the last minute), then anyone who hasn't moved during warmup gets booted right as first round starts. It's incredibly stupid because sometimes I don't care to be tabbed in until the game is about to start, so I'll be tabbed out until I hear the 3 second timer before game start to tab in. If it took too long, then I'll get kicked right before the pistol round starts.

I love them, but they're starting to get a little worn. The coating isn't as rough anymore :( I loved the roughness of the PBT, so I'm in the market for some rough PBTs.\n\nHowever, as keycaps, they look great on the white keyboards. I used to have them on a white rg928. However, the downside is being blanks, they kinda suck for typing passwords and numbers/symbols because I'm not great. Once my hands are aligned, I can do passwords alright, but the symbols on the numbers are still hard because I will still forget what number has each one.

I'm really not sure if anyone actually thinks Niko is overrated. Like god damn, he goes absolutely bonkers most of the time I see him play.
techspot did an OC comparison for the 7700k and the 1800x and the 1700x. The ryzen CPUs still outperformed the i7 in the productivity sector but still lost in gaming. Overall, the results are relatively the same as when neither was overclocked.
I understand the need for top players to continuously prove themselves, but for the lower ranks it's not about proving yourself. It's about the enjoyment you get from playing casually. There's no point in artificially reducing SR for people who are at a skill level just because they don't play because when they come back it's not fun for people who they stomp or for the games they have to solo carry.\n\nI think there's a similar problem in csgo when people get some form of rank decay. People can end up in ranks vastly below their skill level and it's not fun for anyone involved.\n\nNow I'm not saying to remove decay entirely, I believe it is entirely justified for people in like top 500 because they will for the most part play a lot and the accounts most affected by it are other high level alt accounts since people will then need to divide their attention among them.\n\nBut for levels as low as diamond to have the same decay is preposterous. Diamond isn't a high level, it's still relatively casual play.

Hz is more a marketing term than anything else. AMD uses a different instruction set architecture than Intel so you can't just compare clock speeds with one another. For a long time, AMD's CPUs all had higher clock speeds than Intel's but that didn't make them faster than Intel. They just had more cycles per second. But each cycle on AMD does less than a cycle on Intel. Now with the new Ryzen line, I'm not sure what AMD did to their chips because they supposedly improved their instructions per cycle by like 50% (which is clearly a marketing statistic) because that still doesn't tell me what it was before or after.
mr5 with 16k would actually be interesting because it used to be OT rules, but the mode as a full game mode means its also not long enough to get economy rolling at all once your economy fails, so you'd get situations where you start with full buys, and the last round of the half is just pistol force, so it's not representative of the csgo experience with eco'ing to buy later
what if...elon musk is just a compilation of reddit's brain power
I think that might be step 1.5
There's also no reason to be there for warmup, and you get kicked at the end of warmup if you didn't move during warmup. It's incredibly stupid since not everyone cares to move during warmup. I leave sound on and then go browse the reddits until I hear the start timer tick the 3 second warning and then get back in. And then, if I didn't move during warmup, I get kicked just as round starts. It's incredibly stupid.

I assume it's server sided tho because they mad shooting server sided, so there's only 128 ways to throw since 128 ticks servers only use 128 ticks a second, likewise you can only shoot on a tick.
take a look at the benchmarks from everyone (anandtech, arstechnica, tomshardware, extremetech), 7700k beat r7 either was the same or up to 25% faster in every single game tested. There was not a single game that r7 could beat the 7700k.\n\nHowever, workstation productivity performance favors the r7 over the 7700k. And it seems roughly even between the r7 and intel's much more expensive processors, so if you also do a lot of productivity work like rendering or encoding or computation, then r7 is better for performance and value.

I have a cheap TT esports TKL\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Tt-eSPORTS-Tenkeyless-Mechanical-KB-PZX-KBBLUS-01/dp/B00MB0QMJ0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1488792263&sr=8-3&keywords=tt%2Besports&th=1\n\nthat I'd let go for pretty cheap and shipping, PM me.\n\nI had it RMA'd at some point and they sent me a replacement, but I got a new board before it came back so it's basically been unused since I got the new RMA board (I think they sent me a refurbed one, so it's basically just a manufacturer recertified board).\n\nIt's just been sitting in my room unused because I have so many other keyboards to use.\n\nAlso I have one of these:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/EagleTec-KG011-Industrial-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B01LXBRQGV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488792089&sr=8-1&keywords=eagle%2Bkeyboard&th=1\n\nfrom massdrop with Outemu blues, which is RGB and pretty cheap. Keycaps and LEDs lightly used. I stopped using it because these particular blues are pretty loud.
I have a brown switch anne pro I'll be selling if my buy for a pok3r goes through
I'd like to get the roughest possible keycaps. What are my choices here? I've heard SP is pretty good for roughness, but I wanna know if anyone else does rougher or in different profiles or in front prints/shine throughs.
I'm pretty sure it's the monitor because I've had no issues with my other monitors at all, and this is just the newest one and has problems.
So are you a gramma now?
It's funny beacuse checks_out_bot's username is very applicable to their comment.

I'm not worried about it not being functional, but I'm worried about whether or not I can hit the 3200mhz speed on it. It's technically compatible as a DDR4.
I'm enjoying mine a lot. AMA
I am pretty positive the case is a Pok3r since the top lip is slightly thicker. 
There we go, this man knows how to enjoy a banana. Still somewhat firm but without the bitter. Just the right amount of acidity to complement the sweetness.
Man, if I tried to follow my neighbors spending habits, I'd be broke in no time flat. My neighbors are all successful driving around their sports cars, and I'm in the smallest house on the block with cars nearly as old as me.
I mean, I haven't really played anything other than csgo, rocket league, and overwatch since I got it, and I push around 150-200 fps on those with net settings (high in csgo, low in OW, high in RL). I haven't had time to play the other ones so far
I want to echo everyone else. Too much going on, too busy, too cluttered. Too many colors at the same time.\n\nThe current CSGO UI in terms of what's shown on screen at any one time is actually pretty good. What could use improvement is the back end of that UI so that it doesn't shit itself every time you hit a button. But that's the fault of the engine trying to run the UI, and not the UI itself necessarily.
Do you still want one? I'm going to sell my anne pro if a pok3r comes through
2351\n\nThanks fam
Which is an unfortunate reality in hosting an event at such a place. Given the demographic of CSGO players and fans, it doesn't make much sense to host it in Vegas, which is effectively a 21+ city (as in, in terms of stuff to do when you're not at Dreamhack, if you're not  21, there's not a whole lot you can actually do).
Except CSGO is 1 a month...that's not much of commitment if you're only trying to maintain CSGO rank. And even then, if you lose the visible rank, your rating remains about the same and when you play again, you'll be replaced pretty close to where you left off anyways. Unless you lose a bunch after you come back.
To be fair tho, Venom, the dude hitting the ball, does live shows too with his trickshots. He's pretty famous for them. So like, it's a lot of skill and they don't take a million takes.
But that was a one time event because the ranks had become wildly disproportionate. Since then, CSGO has implemented a new system that automatically adjusts the rank boundaries to keep the distribution the same
I mean the other part of it might also be that he takes the game seriously and wants to play it at a competitive level, so when mistakes happen he wants to correct them.\n\nBut then while scrimming with his team, if they're a decent a team, they'll spend time talking about mistakes later. There's no fucking time in the middle of a round to be complaining/bitching/whining/toxic in comms. If you are, you're out of the team ASAP. There is no room to clutter comms with BS, in scrims or in matches. Take those outside the match and discuss so that when you come into the next one, you do it more correctly.\n\nAnd that difference in attitude (I take it that you just want to play it casually so you don't care to improve) is what might cause him to get frustrated when he plays with you guys, while when his team wants to improve, he knows he's playing with other guys at his level who also have the drive to improve and knows he can make constructive comments at a later time because his teammates will listen.
okay Saitama
The 4th gen ones did. I think all the ones before then also did as well. But skylake and kabylake K processors don't come with coolers
Can I get a verification too? GL everyone
only 128 ways to throw
Hz doesn't matter if you're comparing AMD to Intel though. They use different ISAs and microarchitectures so what the CPU actually accomplishes with each cycle is different. It's like comparing whether an apple is better than an orange because it's bigger. They're not directly comparable.
Stand is pretty crap. I thought no one could make a shittier stand than QNIX, but I was wrong, Pixio managed to. But I don't have room to put a monitor mount on my current desk, so I can't do anything about it. \n\nColor accuracy I'm not qualified to say, I'm one of those people who just maxes out digital vibrance to make playing CSGO look good, because I mostly just game and code.
I guess you could say those letters were shifted
I mean, if you put it on low and lower resolutions, some of the higher end processors definitely push 500 fps
PMing
okay Lucio
Maybe I'm just blind, but which one is the light blue shorts? I see a teal towel up in the top left, but those don't look like shorts.
can confirm it does not work, have blocked people and ended up with them on my team again
"Superb build quality" "Corsair" ;)
Wow that wrist rest is just amazing? It's. Storm trooper right?
Any word on pricing?
Just remember to throw the included keypuller in the trash
Those sa caps
Truly ergonomic
Hmm yah, I recognize that name(sorta)
I sorta wanna buy XDA blanks from sentraq.com, they are only $50.
Supposedly the new firmware fixed that issue, can't confirm though since I have yet to try it
What smart phone
regardless, looks cool and nice pics
All I know is that it was added in post
The pok3r was my first 60% I hope your enjoying yourself! 
It looks really cool and is really hefty, but I think $290 is a bit high? Does anybody know if there is a kit available? 
R U coming on Ramas America trip aswell? 
Gotcha
I cringed so much in that vid. 
My keyboard is slightly higher than my elbows as my elbows are level with my desk. 
#SLIGHTLY
The sticker bomb TKL seems very appropriate since so many people do it! 
Lol. Tbh I've never ever ever used scroll lock
I am just annoyed by these mistakes, because a ton of people watch his vids. I am annoyed because he misinforms people. 
The XDA caps just make it that much better
puple my fav
Hmm, I wonder if magnesium allow dents as easily as aluminium
Yah they will probably have an rgb version. I'm loving the stabs that vortex is using now, there really good
You mean 108 key version. It's been re stocked on Amazon
Sadly not, ;)
Blame amos
how does the taobao pbt feel on the norbatouch
Lol, touch typist ayy?
I would love for someone to make a m0110a aluminum. It's one of my favorite keyboards, especially because of the case design
Wow, I never realized the bezel were so thin
Have you tried typing like that?
Artistic!
I love how the suns light shines through the case!

Oh that guy, I know why he's so familiar, I believe he was at NorCal, his custom 60% board deffinetly was.
I can't really comment very accurately since my core has alu case feet on the back, raising the tilt angle. But I don't personally like a sculpted profile on the core. If you core has no raised Feet, I think that scored will feel even better. But totally depends. I really want to try XDA. 
I'm glad that it came out in. Timely manner
Yes plz. I saw m0110a irl and it's bootiful. \nedit: why the downvote
These are from sentraq.com, but they are basically the same thing. I attached it using a thin layer of adhesive. 
60% lyfe, my fav
That's actually super cool, I've never heard of it, but I'm gonna try it!
Already knew that, and I accept that my hand will break. I just find it more comfortable,  The stock core had a 0 degree tilt angle which felt like it was leaning outwards? I'm just used to at least a slight tilt
One person got one for free
Just trying to see how cherry profile is on the core, I still would rather have DSA or XDA on my core. Sorry for phone pic. 
Wow, I'm trying to find keysets that will look good on my core. But wow, SA makes it looks so tall!
It's a gh60, the reason why the switches are a little wonky is because the plate is a little warped and also comes as a consequence when making custom switches.
rip iso
Well it's made by a different company. Ikbc doesn't have control over what vortex does. 
Yah ikr. Sorta want the set now
With blocked corners aswell?
Cherry currently doesn't make MX clear rgbs. So it's not mistels fault
Yes please
Nice!  I got my Realforce 104UB for $100 used on mechmarket. Amazing board. 
Ayy, happens all the time ;)
The highlights are blown!!! Nice wood
Aw man, I really wish though, maybe in the future. 
Is it me or does that depth of field look really weird? 
Sigh'

That Wide Angle shot though
I have most of them memorized, but I basically only us fn1 so it's easy.
Does the compact sq have mini or micro USB?
Hmm, Rama better start making caps out of magnesium then! 
Calls Pad printed keycaps dye sub. :( \nNot as bad a hwc calling topre linear. 
Gmk Carbon is still a stunning set
What do you mean? Gmk triumph Adler doesn't Include a space bar that small.
My mistake, who are they made by?
Hi! Thanks so much!
500 if it hasn't been taken yet. 
Looks like a poker 2, those colored caps also came with the poker 2. I don't know about the blank space bar though. Edit: blank space bar is included
Haha, just the roof of my house in San Francisco. It was lucky it was clear that day. It rained the next day ;)
FYI /r/unexpectedfactorial
Added some alu case feet on my CORE. Tilt angle is now alot more comfortable (for me). 
It's just beautifull!
Bro caps gamer sets. Don't know form which exact same tho\n\nEdit:made by adamski
I got the feet from sentraq.com in the dark grey variant. I used a super thin layer of adhesive, but double sided tape will work just fine. 
Would you by any chance be willing to share the files for the space bars?
Dat key shine tho

Oh OK good to know! 
If you want a metal case, I highly suggest going for the Vortex Pure Mk edition. It starts at $90 for a metal case and pbt keycaps(same as pok3r). But it does have a split right shift.  
linus hating on anything other than ansi
Well I recommend getting case feet and magnetic USB. I find it essential, especially magnetic USB. I am happy with the stock caps but I don't like a sculpted profile in it because the case feet + DSA is at my preferred angle. 
I am interested to see how the New Poker II plays out in the market. It has some pretty steep competition. The Vortex Pure MK edition comes in at the same price but has a split right shift and a metal case. So trading weight, usb-c and some functionality for a metal case and a different layout. I will actually be doing a review on the New Poker II.

Love the maple leaf. Good luck with the GB!
Thanks for the offer but I'm looking for a something bigger than a poker.
1) Yes. 2) TKL. 3) Yes, white please.
Critters in the case :(
I started playing again on the remastered edition as well. Was trying to play differently this time, but I ended up a stealth archer again...
No thanks.
I am typing on 55g right now. It's slightly heavier than novatouch 45g, but the difference isn't as significant as the one between browns and clears. It's not heavy enough for me to feel fatigued too, so I don't think I prefer one weight over the other. By the way, Realforce makes a quality keyboard. I think my only gripe right now is the cable.
Having trouble narrowing it down to top 6! They all look great!
I can't decide which color I like more. They all look so pretty!

So true on the product description. It got updated to 6 Gaterons including greens.

I would join a group buy for keybirds :)
Will do. I got tired typing on MX clears so 55g might not be for me. I'm hoping they won't feel as heavy as clears.

Originally, I was hoping to just keep the colors I liked, then trade the others for the colors I liked but didn't get. But now I have a rainbow! Might still trade but I do want to keep a rainbow which may be hard to do....
Very cool of you to do this! Gonna try to stay awake for all of it

Christmas in 3016 will take place in space on the way to a new planet! (Just finished watching Interstellar on a plane.)
One that you like.
The condition of the keyboard and mousepad wrist rest are actually vomit inducing....cool desk tho.
Arhan, a player from afreeca freecs blue has either Filco TKL or Leopold 750r with Tai Hao orange caps and a couple of artisans and a Filco wooden wristrest and another player from the same team has several artisans aswell.\nIve ment to take a screenshot so many times but i always forget.\n\nAnd TviQ from Misfits has a Poker.
I actually hope this is how it happened, the owners just carrying players out of the houses like they used to carry The Stig around in Top Gear, if not...i'm greatly disappointed.
Sure but still doesnt change the fact that i think it was a bit of showboating from Panthera knowing they are so heavily favoured like Fissure said in his interview they dont think Flash Lux is that strong of a team. Nonetheless it was still impressive to watch.
May the hidden MMR be with you.
Clearly your GPU can handle more then everything on low if its sitting at 35% so at that point the only reason to have everything on low is visibility not FPS, also 4690k @ stock which according to you bottlenecks, why? Makes no sense to buy a K series CPU to keep it at stock and complain its bottlenecking.\n\nAre you sure there is nothing else wrong with your PC because i've got worse GPU (980ti) slower ram (1600mhz ddr3) but 4790k @ 4.8ghz which sits at around 40-50% but clearly its not 50% faster then stock 4690k and i get better fps all @ ultra 1080p then you get on low.
Is there a reason why VA69M is not an option? literally the same board but ISO.
Quite clear that the hotfix to correct the permanent health from sound barrier for Sombra had some unwanted side effects.\n\nThe reasonable thing would be to ban Sombra from the tournament, i feel for the teams that run her but the alternative is much worse.\n\nEDIT: or they have Blizzard on the hotline and know how to avoid it, yay!\n\nEDIT2: or not.... 
The league is played on a LAN server and because of that players had everything unlocked (including all portraits but skins are not allowed). This was the first time in Apex (apart from the season 1 finals) they used the 144hz tick LAN client.
I really dont have anything to say that hasnt been said already but i hope you dont let people like that affect you too much and i wish you all the best!
I dont have Ducky One but i get basically instant pain without a wrist rest with either Filco or Ducky Shine 3, with a wrist rest i can go on for hours.\nAs rests i've got Ducky leather one for the Shine 3 and Filco wooden one for the Majestouch.
256 USD
Nothing really massive, i like the look better, more desk space and more natural gaming posture, all very subjective ofcourse.
You're not the only one, every time i see all the LED hell setups i think "that has to be the most annoying thing ever" which is why the only leds in my entire setup are power and hdd leds. The illumination is provided by an actual lamp.
Finally after quite literally years of searching i got keycaps i actually like.\n\nOnly gripe i have is that the ISO enter is slightly different color and thinner then the rest of the darker keys.\n\nI apologize for the picture, i have 0 artistic vision i just point at a thing and press a button.
Just tested it and for me personally it takes away the "floatiness" almost entirely.\n\nNot really helpful as i have no idea how to describe it more accurately but the game does feel a hell of a lot more responsive.\n\nNo impact performance wise but i've got quite a beefy PC.
Now if only we could get dark outlines for the fonts so they would be actually readable with the carbage bitrates.
It might be a rule in some other esports i've no idea...i have never heard of anything like that but thats what he uses and has used since the beginning in OW. Plenty of keyboards have macro keys so i dont see why it would be a problem to use 60% if that was the case then by same logic they should ban plenty of Logitech and Corsair boards.
Want to not have an aneurysm? Stay away from the thread concerning this topic at r/overwatch.
Not really, unless you german. 
Great to watch but i wonder if they would've gotten away with it against a better team especially on point A 1v1 a soldier i think someone like CarryHook might have just shot her in the head and be on his merry way.
Yes because when those games came out 5-15 years ago they were instantly at the level of play they are today, its not like it took 2-3 years for LoL to even have the lane meta it has today and people were laughing at LoL for not having any depth.\n\nI'm sure back in 2000 the CS pros were lining up smokes and doing coordinated pushes and fakes while holding cross fires and the game hasnt changed at all.\n\nAnd on top of that this topic really needed the thread #1928 with the same comparisons that still get shot down instantly because they are just rediculous and show how little yet again the OP knows about the game and fair comparisons.
Terry Crews as Mei, yes please.
"Our plan is to expand the league over time to include additional teams from the Americas, Europe, China, Korea and Asia pacific region"\n\nThe wording "expand, over time". Also there was an interview somewhere from Blizzcon where i think the timeframe was "later in 2017 for NA, and in 2018 for the rest of the world" or something similiar.
Ah yes, the age old "im playing on a higher level" argument.\n\nThere are these people called coaches in sports and esports alike and especially in sports these coaches are usually twice or even 3 times the age of the players so clearly they cant compete at the physical level but yet they are the ones teaching, its almost like you can know stuff with just by studying and dont have to be at a professinal level as a player....weird how that works.\n
As a Finnish person, i can vouch for this statement.
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/123840091 23min 36sec mark you can see the last 3 players all rocking what i think are Leopolds with artisans, seems that Arhan has switched off of Filco + Tai Hao.\n\nEDIT: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/103049856 10min 48sec mark you can see his old keyboard.
Estimated delivery time was 7-9 days but they came in 3 days via DHL express, the alphas are light grey.\n\nhttps://bbs.io-tech.fi/attachments/20170215_185202-jpg.8196/ there's a picture with better lighting.
If the review claims that a keyboard isnt good for gaming because it doesnt have backlighting....you might want to read another review.
More testing needed would be the most logical answer.
Couldnt agree more.
Also in the patch was included the "Reduce buffering" option so remember to check that.
Im not saying he isnt viable or that he isnt broken, he might be but lets be realistic here the reason everyone is playing bastion in scrims is because he is new and people want to test what he ia capable of and it takes time for people to find out how to deal with him efficiently. You can take a look at the tank meta for example it was horrible to play and to watch but people were hailing it as the be all and end all and then the koreans just came and destroyed it by just simply outplaying their opponents. \n\nWhen it comes to scrims people put way too much weight on scrim results as has been proven many many times especially when the patch is new. There is a great podcast called oversight where you can get your "more qualified" opinion on scrim results from people who are actually at the peak of competitve OW and esports in general.\n\nBut you've clearly made your mind that anything i say is nothing of value so ill just stop arguing but incase you're interested there are plenty of great articles and videos around the net how to properly evaluate scrim results. 
Thats what you can read between the lines of them not saying anything else except "overtime they want to expand to other regions" but it could be that they are just so early in the whole league thing that they just dont want to say anything wrong.\n\nWhat they're doing with OWL right now is what Blizzard is a master at "speak alot, say very little" if that makes sense and ill hold onto my skepticism until they actually say straight up whats going to happen with rest of the world. Until then ill expect the worst which is they have no plans outside US so that way i wont be disappointed, atleast not that much.
While i love my countrymen from NiP but for the love of god you have to realize when the Hog and/or Zarya is just not working, when the only time you lose is when there is hitscan freely peppering you from the highground for minutes on end and nothing is done for almost 4 minutes you kinda deserve to lose.\n\nThank god Mafu switched to Dva and what a surprise they won, i just wish they do it faster next time and come to understand that there comes a point when teams just do what Fnatic did, know exactly what is coming and just straight up counter you, and with time it'll just become easier and it'll be you who has to adapt instead of run headfirst to the wall over and over again.
First thing to do with every new GPU, make your own fan profile because the defaults are shit, nothing new there.
Cringe the movie? 
And this is exactly why the only thing allowed on my desk is the leak free water bottle and even that is on the other side of the desk so that even if for some reason it wasnt closed and were to fall over it'd maybe get my mouse pad wet.\nGlad you got it cleaned though!
1.30am GMT.
What happened to your mouse cord? :O
Nope, they are not.
Nope, with the new LAN client it was said specifically that all emotes and sprays are available and they were used aswell. Before that they just had lvl 1 accounts which had nothing unlocked. 
Ok so let me get this straight... Several hundred or thousand people complaining that the stream is shit and you're telling us we're wrong and its fine with your condesending attitude. Surely you understand that when the majority of the people say something is wrong you cant use "its fine for me"  as any sort of argument. Incase with all that esport and technical superiority pumping through your veins is clouding your judgement, let me give you an example... You're in a plane crash and are the only survivor, you dont go "it's not really that bad, all i got was a couple of bruises, maybe people need to toughen up".\nI sincerely hope that you're the only one with that attitude at MLG. 
But none of that is new in any way and has been said over and over again in every single interview, maybe fluff is a wrong word and "the usual marketing speech" is more accurate.
Tbh im not surprised a console player finds the tournaments confusing, what i've been watching a friend of mine who plays on PS4 it is actually ridiculous how slow the game is compared to PC (or he could be just bad :D).
It's one of the SATA power cables tucked in with the rest of the pre run cables, i think it says "12v" or something.
And what is that? Because those 2 are pretty different in terms of.... Well, everything but since were taking past experiences why not include brood war that is the granddad on all esport and what made esport what it is today and im not sure why you count SC2 and HotS in the same category because lets be real SC2 was the "LoL and DotA" before LoL and DotA2 and lets not forget when for example LoL came out people were laughing aswell "lol shit game 0 depth casual game lol". \n\nNow do i think Blizzard themselves fucked up with SC2 as an esport and do i have faith in them in regards of OW is a totally different thing but that has nothing to do with the games depth or popularity. 
Success yes, hosted by Blizzard no, and Korea is an exception because they actually know what they're doing.
I'm not a 100% sure but an educated guess would be that it reduces the frame buffer to a minimum (no idea what it is) to reduce input lag.\n\nThere already is an option to do it in Nvidia control panel, does this seperate option reduce it further, i have no idea.
Well this is disapointing... My first reaction "oh shit,  a reason to go to assembly for the first time in 16 years"  saw the date and realized i have a surgery that day... FeelsBadMan. Best of luck to all the teams. 
I always sink mine into a bucket of hot water with some dishwashing detergent in it and just let it soak in there for an hour or two or so and scrub it gently with my hand because.\n\n1. Its mostly grease and dead skin cells from your hands/wrist and dishwashing detergent is the best at getting rid of grease, soap does nothing compared also most soaps have some sort of balming things that just end up making the pad feel even more greasy.\n\n2. If you scrub too hard with basically anything uneven be it a sponge, brush or even a harder towel you'll end up cutting the fibers and after 2 washes the pad is basically unusable but with your hands you can go ham and not do any damage as long as you dont use your nails.\n\nNowdays i just skip the scrubbing part and do the sinking part more often (once every month or 2) so the pad doesnt get as dirty so there is no need to scrub it.
I agree with /u/maxdps_.  I'm fine with the window and pricing if it is around $20. \n\nI would be interested in the HHKB caps. 
It'll come in time but at the moment everyone's just waiting for the OW league which is why its so stagnant and most likely will be since there are months and months to go till OWL.\n\nAlso million viewers for a CS major where cases are dropped, your usual ESL or equivalent lan where there are no case drops 100k viewers. Nuff said.
That i can agree with, except the part about Riot catering to their competitive audience when they deliberately make lane swapping a non option for pro play because "it doesnt match the experience of your avarage player". 
Less then 24hours since the patch,  calls things meta :thinking:
> The other important aspect of Finnish culture is that interpersonal communication (e.g., ‘niceties, tact, and friendliness’) is viewed with distaste and a waste of time. In order to work with Finns, you have to get to the point, don’t bother with tact or friendly banter (seen as being dishonest in Finland), and don’t be formal.\n\nHaha couldnt agree more, i cant count over the years how many times i've been asked if im angry or why am i so rude because i dont like to waste time with small talk, just say what i have to say and get on with it.\n\nAlso for the same reason the interviews with Kimi Räikkönen are so hilarious.
Jesus, that sounds the same as having to deal with Chinese embassy in Helsinki, open like 2 hours a day 2 days a week, almost impossible to get anything done even if you live in Helsinki, let alone if you have to drive from Turku only to find out that they've fucked up something, stressfull as fuck even without such time constraints as you've been dealing with. Best of luck in the tourney and torille if you guys win!
Pick me
Varmilo directly, zhh19@zhihaihe.cn.\nCynthia was very helpful and overall the service was great, you can even choose different prints more specific then nordic, mine for example are fin/swe and without the Varmilo specific FN prints which i was not expecting was even possible and that was a very pleasant surprise.
Yeah ofc, i just wanted to make it extremely clear so someone doesnt go and use a brush or something that would also qualify as sandpaper and ruin everything.
That and Doas humour are the main reasons i love the pair so much.\n\nThere is nothing more i hate then fake hype which is the only reason i cant watch pro HotS games anymore, while i love the game i just cannot stand casters shouting like retards when the game is clearly over and for the same reason i stopped watching Smite all together and had a few year break from LoL pro scene.
Took years for the games you mention to get where they are today in terms of tactics.  Presuming that the current state of the game is the pinnacle for all time yet to come is just ridiculous. 
Idd, i had the same mouse but its so freaking small it gave me cramps playing FPS due to having to keep my hand so tense all the time to be able to move it properly.\n\nBest thumb buttons of any mouse i've had ever though.
So turns out the update just corrupted my Blood and Vine auto saves which makes no sense but after scouring through all the saves i managed to find a manual save which only lost me around 20 hours so i guess thats a plus.
Finnish/Swedish ISO caps on their way, should arrive this week, cant wait! Took every inch of willpower not to order a VA69M at the same time (we'll see how long it lasts :p).
Awesome! Cant wait. 
I'd advice to avoid razer and buying a real board with blues and remember that what "gaming" really means is "we want more money from you but our product is of lesser quality with features that dont matter".
Yeah ofcourse but why would people who arent german order ISO GER products? Hence only nice for german people.\nThanks for the downvote though for being accurate.
WHAT?!?!
Ofcourse there are russians who speak english and trolls and dicks are in every country but there is a reason why most of the games got russian servers seperate, just like brazil and latin america are seperated.
Keyboards only or keycaps aswell? I really dont need a 4th board... Keycaps on the other hand, one can never have too many, especially when the ISO nordic market is extremely limited. 
Thanks! It's nothing big so its all good. 
Yeah, it is totally subjective for me the biggest reason was because i play mostly FPS games and especially Overwatch requires so much arm movement i noticed that my shoulder got tired due to having my arms in so wide V shape so i was really never resting my shoulder. Also i just wanted a new keyboard :D
~~[Sure no problem!](http://i.imgur.com/xI0wkk2.png)~~\n\n~~ETA Feb 27 to March 10~~\n\n~~So potentially slightly more than a week I guess, but 30 to 50 bucks cheaper than on Amazon.~~\n\n\nNevermind, I'm the blind one, that's the M version.
I'm in my early 30s and got to 3400 s3 and was still gaining more from wins then losing, what stopped from climbing was a leg surgery and by the time it was in a condition for me to sit on the PC again the decay had kicked in and i was at 3000 so decided to take a break.\n\nI wouldnt say my mechanics have gotten noticeably worse, but surely im not as fast as i was in my og Quake days which is why i try to avoid Genji and Tracer.\n\nMy strongest point is probably my positioning and game sense which comes from being the raid leader of one of the top wow guilds at the time for several years so that has been engraved to my brain and that is why i love playing supports (except Mercy) because you can see the big picture.\nBut at the same time that is my biggest flaw, i tend to overthink things and sort of outplay myself and after the fact i always remember that you dont need to be a tactical mastermind in soloque because most of the people dont give a fuck, i used to try to get people to execute some strategies but sort of gave up on that after realizing that people rarely listen and more often then not you get told to fuck off for being an elitist prick or something equally positive.\n\nI personally feel that i havent hit my peak in competitive yet and realisitically i think i might be able to squeeze in to around the 4k mark but i really cant be bothered to listen people bitching and moaning how team sucks but they're the gods gift to competitive Overwatch.\n\nMy usual competitive mindset is to just go with the team even if you think what they're doing is completely retarded, atleast that way you are with the team and increase your chances while being hyper self critical and constantly think what i could do differently in situations where i think i made a mistake (which are plentyful).
But the thing is, there has always been a surplus of ansi products so its nothing  "awesome for the people in EU".
I guess the sayings "men think with their dick" and "business before pleasure" couldnt be more accurate.
Jesus christ this quality is abyssmal. 
Yeah and the trick is to find the sweetspot for the noise and cooling so for me personally i've got a very mild curve until 40% @ 65 degrees celsius because i've yet to find a game that stresses my GPU over 65c and after 40% fan speed the fans get annoyingly loud. And always go few degrees over your "max" GPU temp in games because if you go just to the edge of the limit and do more stronger curve after the "max" temp the fans go crazy switching the speeds constantly.\n\nIn comparison the stock fan curve for me was 0db mode until 60c then basically 20% fan speed until 80 degrees celsius and after that skyrocket up to 75% which is deafening.\n\n\nHow i do it is as follows.\n\n1. Download MSI Afterburner\n2. Set the fans to manual and increase their speed by 10% until you've come to a point where you think the noise level is too much and go down couple of % which is completely subjective and varies by GPU (for me and my GPU its 40%)\n3. Fire up your most demanding game and see where the temps are at and if you're happy with the temps (i usually target below 70 degrees celsius).\n4. Set fan curve couple of degrees higher then the maximum you saw in the demanding game i.e if your max was 63c go with 66 and from there decrease the curve to your idle temps and speeds for me its 28 degrees 20% fan speed.\n\nIf you're not happy with the temperatures you got from setting the speed to the comfortable limit then the choice is yours to either be happy with either louder noise or higher temps but play with the curve until you've found your happy middle ground.\n\nPS. the below 70c is totally subjective temperature, 75 is totally fine even 80c passable but i just dont like things running hot.\n
Twitch chat being it's usual cesspool, why is this a thread?
Nop, nothing, still all US, thats the one piece of news im constantly looking.
Amazing how these DDOS attacks always follow a ban wave, the salt is real.
I used it for around 3 years or so and its still as good as new and would still probably use it if i didnt want a TKL which is why i switched to a Filco.
I love it how he just ignores the whole problem and throws down random comparisons that have nothing to do with the problem itself.\n\nLike for example their quality is crap which has nothing to do with what platform the broadcast is on.\n\nIf CBS offers a 1080p broadcast and FOX a VHS quality, i sure as hell will never watch anything on FOX.
Or maybe if you want a slow moving shield to help you push forward..... Pick Reinhardt. 
If this is indeed true, i would like to make a suggestion to Blizzard to stop eating shrooms.\n\nEDIT: To give more context, sure i could see this or even more for established games but for OW in its current state...nope.
Tested the option in PTR but the results werent nearly as drastic as they are on live.\n\nI've had the pre rendered frames set to 1 from the start but still the reduce buffering makes the game feel like a feather, so light in fact that i had to drop my sens from 1600/3 to 1600/2.2 cos i was just spinning out of control and couldnt hit shit, the way i noticed the difference straight away was with Lucio who i have a feeling for the melee delay, well did, the timing i had gotten used to during the over 100 hours on Lucio was just way off but not in a bad way.\n\nI'm running everything on ultra 100% render scale 1080p with fps locked to 154 with 0 fluctuation in fps and specs are as follows\n\n4790k @ 4.8ghz\n\n980ti @ 1450mhz/7850mhz\n\n16gigs 1600mhz DDR3\n\ngame installed to a Samsung 850 pro SSD\n\nThe CPU and GPU usage are similiar enough that i havent noticed any difference.\n\nBack to learning the feeling of the game all over again.\n\n\nEDIT: After playing a couple of more heroes, seems that the most notable impact was on Lucio.
I do think owning it is a better suggestion than covering it up.
Looks like OP isn't interested.  Let me know if you are and I'll take some pics.
Been using ZA11 with a some sort of hybrid grip for quite some time, i like it alot.\n\nWhat i will say about Zowie/BenQ mice is that try before you buy, not everyone likes the heavier buttons and i would highly recommend of buying it from a local store because the quality varies immensely when it comes to thumb buttons and scroll wheel. \nMy first ZA11 had very wobbly scroll wheel to the point it made the whole mouse make clanking sounds when moved fast, so i went to return it and before taking in the replacement one i asked to open the box and test the mouse at the store, opened 6 boxes before i found one with a solid scroll wheel and thumb buttons, the other mice werent broken or anything, Zowie/BenQ quality control just needs alot of work and im very picky.\n\nIf you do decide to buy one test the wheels by shaking the mouse and try to move the wheel from side to side, it shouldnt have any or very very minimal movement from left to right. I personally would never order a Zowie mouse online.
No real new info, just a couple of "clarifications" if you can call them that.\n\n1. The Combine wont have players benchpress or do other physical things (a shocker i know).\n\n2. The players dont have to live in the city they represent or even live in the US. (which was pretty obvious for the league to work at all.)\n\nThe rest is the usual fluff that has been said many many times.
They're not blank? :p
Varmilo caps are like sand paper which i personally love but you might want to avoid those.
This was my first thought aswell and the main reason why i await with horror for more info on the OW league. A company that doesnt understand why such a simple thing as map draft is important for the integrity of the tournament shouldnt be allowed to organize a whole league. \nSure you can argue that MLG is not Blizzard but surely Blizzard has the last say if they wanted to. 
I'm fairly certain Jeff said at Blizzcon that they will release heroes 1 by 1 because the release of multiple heroes is a balancing nightmare and thats what happened with the release of Mei, Genji and D.va.
Yeah, just like Sombra and Ana, im sorry if i dont find your temper tantrum very convincing.
As long as i can watch it via a platform that has a smart tv app im fine, i just hope the viewership doesnt suffer too much and if this exclusion of twitch is to become a norm they atleast keep youtube or make MLGtv app for TVs.
And there it is, the esport side of Blizzard that doesnt know what the fuck it's doing. Welcome back old friend. 
What i ment with my reply is that its still all US talk no mention of any other region except in the announcement video where they said "overtime they will expand EU,SEA" and other regions.
These are the best, i wonder if ill ever stop laughing at these.
Now if only we could get dark outlines for fonts so they are actually readable.
All i want is a different look for his weapon and not just a crap recolor over and over and over again.
I think [this](https://world.taobao.com/item/541449437611.htm?fromSite=main&_u=j29gpoki6177) is the source of the groupbuy on taobao.
You can check r/mechmarket to see what pops up. A few people ordered prototypes directly from Taobao, and there were two GBs, so once people start getting them (the original GB has started shipping for some colors), they might show up.\n\nmadergaser said there might be some extras once everything has shipped and everything is good.
I won't be selling, but others might.
That was the site /u/madergaser was using for the KBD75 group buy.\n\nIt was thrown together literally just for that purpose. If you tried to order from there, it'll probably just be cancelled. I'm surprised it's still even up, TBH.
I got in on the group buy and just got a shipping notification, so you might want to watch mechmarket in about a week or so. There might be extras as well, but /u/madergaser might be able to chime in who is the GB organizer.
Thanks for the info. Its the first link through google. Would you know where i could get my hands on one?\n
Magicforce 68 is a great choice if you can't let go of arrow keys or maybe Anne Pro for the full 60% layout. It's bluetooth as well iirc. 
You should get a switch tester first. Or try out switches in some other way. Reading up on how switches feel is way different from first hand experience. And that is the only decent way of finding out which one you'd like best.\n\nIf you want a decent keyboard that's cheap, the Magicforce 68 with Gaterons is a good choice.
I don't own any of the boards you are looking at.  But I do own both a RF 104UB and a Leopold FC980C.\n\nIf they are representative of their respective brands, I can only say I find the Leopold to be somewhat "tighter" feeling overall, and it also has more thock.\n\nI think they are both great boards, but if I could only have one it would be the Leopold.
It's possible to mod the Hhkb to be 55g and have the alphas on your rf be 55g
The FC980c is made by the Japanese Realforce manufacturers, so it's actually higher quality than the FC660C, which is made in China.\n\nI've only tried the 660 in stores so I can't make a full comparison, but apparently there's some difference.
Ouch that board a couple years back was only $220aud (Dyesub Gray)\n\nAlso note that the leopold has considerable weight (steel backplate) so not sure how high portability ranks on your list but the HHKB is definitely lighter than the fc660c\n\nTopre modding is also the most infuriating task, I hope you don't have carpet.\n\nI have owned all three board you are Enquiring about and I'm keeping only the Hhkb (sold the fc660c and the rf is for sale now)
I have the 87u 55g and absolutely love it. It is without a doubt my favorite board. However I did just get an HHKB and love that one as well. You would be surprised how fast you grow accustomed to the control key being where the caps lock normally is. The one that was a bit harder was the backspace key being a row lower (in the Mac setting it defaults to backspace as opposed to delete). But even that only really took me a couple days. \n\nBut again I love the extra weight of the 87u. If I was a little more brave I would do a dome swap and have both be 55g but I don't think that's going to happen. 
All topre boards are great, and while there are differences in sound and feel due to construction, I think it should primarily come down to layout.  I'm on my fc660c right now, and I love it.  
Thank you everyone for your responses.\n\nAfter this I'm thinking I may move more towards the FC660C with Hyperspheres and Lube. \nI'm a sucker for some DIY anyways.\n\nIt has the more preferred layout and it is a little more portable than the 87U with its bigger size and non detachable cable.\n\nNow to save $400 AUD.
I used to live in Aus, I chose the HHKB because of the layout and the combination of the factors that attribute to the overall typing experience. YMMV\n\nBut regardless if you are to pick any of the three aforementioned boards you won't be disappointed.
rf 87u w/ 55g domes = god mode
Not sure, but check the back of your keyboard if it's made in Japan or elsewhere. IIRC Leopold doesn't own a factory(?) in Japan.\n\nThey are most likely both made by RF, though i can't find a source on that atm.
I love the HHKB layout. I never use caps lock so having control there is great. I actually changed all of my boards to the HHKB layout. If you are going for silence then go for a HHKB pro 2 Type S. Of just get hypersheres off of eBay. I have a Realforce 87u on the JUST to dome swap with my HHKB then I'll sell it. 
How come you chose the HHKB over the others. \n\nI'm assuming you live in Aus? \nThat price was straight from eBay, so there may be better places to get them I'm not sure. 
I have an FC980C which is 45g and a RF 104UB which is variable weighting.\n\nBoth are significantly quieter than my keyboards with browns - and I don't think the weight of the switch will have any impact here.\n\n
*CarrieFisher*\n\nor \n\n*Leia*\n\nObvious reasons I hope
PM'ed
I have an fc660c, two realforce 55g 87u (white and 10th anv), a variable 104u, a novatouch and recently sold a 980c and a different variable 104u. \n\nWith that, in my opinion/experience, your best bet is to go with anything uniform 45g/55g and make sure to add hypersphere rings and lube . Variable weight and/or non-silent versions are great as-is but uniform and slienced is like typing on clouds. \n\nWhile I daily drive the two 87u 55g boards (home and work), you can't go wrong with the 660. \n\nThe 660c feels like you're just getting shit done. Small footprint. 45g uniform. With hyperspheres and lube, the board is nearly perfect. Plus, if you're a Mac user, I found the FN key combinations translate very well. 
I have a Realforce 55G whose box says "Topre" for the manufacturer and another Realforce variable weight whose box says "Leopold". Does this mean that one is somehow lower quality than the other, or was made somewhere else?
I generally agree with you.\n\nI've watched both of them with my son, who is now 12.  We've enjoyed them both.\n\nI would argue that the original was better if, as you say, someone wants something a bit more dramatic and mature in its themes.  On the other hand, TTG *is* fun.  It makes us both giggle sometimes, and doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nIf you want TTG to be a replacement for TT, then it falls way short - because it's not offering the same thing.\n\nTTG is offering something different than TT was, and to a slightly different audience, IMO.\n\nAfter recognizing and accepting that TT is gone, I'd surely rather have TTG than nothing at all.
Gah, fine, we're both going to lose to totally not a virus anyway.  Give some love to my Carrie Fisher idea also please!  :-)
Respectfully, I feel like you didn't read my post fully if this is your response.\n\n> That there are places that force it on the population that doesn't mean that it can't be worn voluntary symbol of piety.\n\nI have covered already in my post that I understand some women wear it voluntarily.\n\n>Isis is known to violently punish men for shaving their beard, does that mean any Muslim man with a beard is forced to keep it ? \n\nWell, Isis is much smaller than the country of Iran (I'm only picking on Iran because it's the example country in my OP), and more importantly is not a nation at all. And, I think no one is suggesting that Isis is representative of the laws of any particular nation or significant portion of Islam. (Unlike Iran)\n\nFurther, there aren't overarching concerns regarding men's rights in Islamic culture as there are regarding women's rights.\n\nLastly, I'm not in /r/askmensrights - so whatever might be going on there is not relevant to this discussion.  :-)\n\n**Edit:**\n\n>I do think it's acceptable to bann fully covering clothing however. \n\nI have to admit that this is a response I did not expect.  What's your reasoning there?  I'm actually not for banning any of it - I just think that cultural or legal pressure for muslim women to wear it seems like it should be low hanging fruit for the feminist movement.
If you'd like to hear someone say most of what you were thinking while watching that video out loud and in public, [have a look here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRWrmT0ovPE)
I have somewhat less experience than some folks here.  The boards I have tried and own are all in my flair (except a 9000v1, but usability-wise it's identical to my v2 anyhow).\n\nOf those I've tried, my FC980C is easily my favorite.  It's tight feeling, heavy for its size, delicious stock caps, best layout EVAR, and has that super-pleasing topre thock.\n\nI am considering a 660C for the house since by all accounts it's built just as nice, but another part of me just wants another 980C because it's hard for me to imagine anything else being at least slightly less perfect.  Fortunately I can afford neither right now, so I have some time to make up my mind.\n\nAnd to my surprise, my Model M, which set me down this road due to loving them in the 80's and 90's, is my least favorite.\n\nThey were all good choices for me, I don't dislike or regret purchasing any of them, but the 980C is the clear winner.\n\n\n\n
It got lots better over time.  Still the moment of cringe here and there, but great character development, and some good long arcs.
I bought a used GloHD off of Ebay about a year ago, and long story short I ended up getting a new one at about the same time, and just stayed with that because the back of the used one was a bit more scuffed than I expected.\n\nThe used one been sitting in my sock drawer in the packaging I received it in because I didn't want the hassle of trying to return it to Canada.\n\nI charged it and used it about 1 day, and aside from the scuff on the back it does seem to be like new.\n\nI realize this doesn't help your problem directly, but I'd let it go pretty cheap if you are interested.  I love my GloHD, and wouldn't want an Aura 2 either.
Did you go to school....  in Olympia?
Maybe I'm misunderstanding what "dissertation tutor" is, but it doesn't sound like someone who you need to worry about regarding what they think of some silly mishap that occurred while you were home. \n\nAlso - maybe you don't understand [what I mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5v84ti/tifu_by_underestimating_the_power_of_a_suction_cup/de0jru4/) by owning it.  There's no reason for the person he's meeting with to think he got in a fight.\n\nAlso - why are you so angry sounding about this?\n\nAs to what he gains - I'd rather just be upfront about why I have a bruise on my head than try to put makeup on it and pretend it doesn't exist.  If the other person is inclined to make assumptions about how it got there, covering it up (which is not going to go unnoticed in a face to face meeting) seems alot shadier than "I put a suction cup on my head like an idiot."

would you sell me skeletor's key tray :))\n\nGLWT :)
Well I hope you like it!\n\nAFAIK my FC980C is nearly the same board plus a few more keys, and I enjoy it more with each passing day.  But, switches are a personal choice, so we'll see.\n\nMy only suggestion to you is this - don't a;ldfja;ldfja on it and decide what you think of it just from that.\n\nUse it for a few days, type up some long emails, or whatever you kids type up on a computer these days ;-) and see what you think after you've really experienced it.\n\nThe good news is that if you find out it's not for you, Topre boards hold their value well.  Unpack and open it carefully, keep it clean, don't destroy the packing materials and box, and you could probably get nearly what you paid for it on /r/mechmarket in a couple of weeks if you decide to go that way.\n\nI think you'll love it though.  And it's a really popular Topre board, so plenty of folks here can answer questions about it if you have them.  :-)
I think you meant to respond to /u/thefray777 
Sorry I went to sleep.\n\nYour other listing is gone, so either you bought it or someone else did.\n\nThis guy has 100% positive feedback on 3000 transactions, and has already sold 37 of these specific boards.\n\nHe's got 4 left so I say go for it while you can!\n\nGood luck!
I've done that.  More than once.
I'm not sure there is a DC one.\n\nMy son watches some Marvel shows with my wife (you can see the split in our family) but I don't know if they are on the same level as TT was.\n\nNot that I refuse to watch them mind you, that's just something they tend to do during *their* time together.  If we're all together we usually play board games or video games together...
WARNING - The downside of Topre is that many custom keycaps don't fit.  Most of them are made for Cherry MX.\n\nThere are some custom Topre caps avail, but most of the custom caps you will see here are NOT going to fit.\n\nOTOH, these come with some of the nicest stock caps you will find.  PBT with a great texture.\n\nBut if that's a dealkiller for you, don't pull the trigger on a Topre board.
No worries - First Car is Best Car; this is always true.\n\nEmbrace its quirkiness and you'll probably love it. :-)
For some reason, no post that I've read from this sub has ever made me laugh harder than this.  Thanks for posting, I truly enjoyed it!  :-)
Well, I was a little surprised by the language choice.  But I try not to be a prude.\n\nAs to the artifacts - photos linked here sometimes get rehosted, resized, and recompressed alot, so it really didn't jump out at me.\n\nI see your point though.
I do apologize for spamming this link here, but at least three of you seemed like you'd enjoy it.  [Same video, h3h3 reaction.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRWrmT0ovPE)
Thanks very much for this comparison!\n\nLooks like I just have to wait until I convince myself that it's OK to buy another board then.  :-)\n\nAlso, really appreciate the pics - it's like the 980C has a little brother.  
Ok.
Woah really?  Got a link?  (not doubting you just excited)
It got lots better over time.  Still the moment of cringe here and there, but great character development, and some good long arcs.

Oh well, it's only bigotry then.  Carry on, I don't know why anyone was complaining.
Born and raised in the US and I also hate automatics, as do many people I know.  You keep on with your stereotyping though, it's **hilarious.**  And you can get karma that way, I hear!
Watched Young Justice with my son too - agree with your analysis.  I was sad to get to the end of it, but it wasn't quite TT.
Oh now I'm confused.  I thought your last post meant that you ordered the one from the Ebay link.  Sorry!
There's a simple solution to a panicking cat - grab it with a towel.  Given the surroundings, I'm sure this was an option.\n\nHaving said that, I'm not hoisting a pitchfork - but having been a cat owner, that's the easy solution to most panicking cat problems.  I had one that would sneak outside every so often, then be freaked out by it, and be nearly impossible to pick up.  5 seconds with a towel, wrapped up snug, carried back inside.
Warmth, I'd guess, but I really don't know.
Just conversationally - I'm surprised to hear that because I'm slowly concluding that I like my 980C more than my RF - but I do have the variable RF, so that may play into it.  If anything, the 980 feels heaver than I expected, not that I'm complaining.\n\nGoes to show that we all have different fingers, I guess....  :-)
I take it you haven't seen the movie.
My F980C is significantly thockier than my realforce.  I have nothing else to compare it against though.
I'll leave it to someone who has experience in the legal system to say for sure, but AFAIK (based on being in court a few times for various things) *anything* you do in a courtroom that the judge deems as disrespectful or disruptive to themselves or the proceedings, and especially in the event that the judge has previously commented that the behavior is unacceptable, is grounds for contempt of court, at least.\n\nNow you could make some strawman like "what if she says not to breathe" if you want, but I hope we're not going to go there.\n\nThe fact that so many people fail to recognize this is why stories similar to this crop up every so often.\n\nIt's really simple:  When you are in a courtroom you behave exactly as the judge instructs you to.  If the judge tells you to stop doing something, you *fucking stop doing it.*  And you stop doing it with no backtalk, no fuss, no muttered curses under your breath.
It's clear that there were some goings on prior to the beginning of the clip.  You can assume that the judge is on a mad power trip if you want, I prefer to assume that she wouldn't remain a judge long if this were so.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with sending someone to jail overnight while thinking they are going to be there 93 days.  The point is to discourage similar behavior in the future.  I'm betting it worked.\n\nI'm quite sure you will disagree, but I assure you there's probably not much point in debating it unless you are open to changing your view.  I'm behind this judge 100% - some people think there is no situation so serious that their asshattery isn't also allowed.  I'm completely OK with disabusing them of that notion.
I know nothing of knives, but if I try to picture using one, it seems to me that unless it's going to fold up and go in my pocket, my primary concern with the size of the handle feels like it would probably be that I can comfortably grip it.  \n\nI could see a too-short handle digging into my palm or otherwise being awkward to maintain a grip on in certain circumstances.\n\nI have no idea if that is a valid answer to your question though.
I'm 100% sure that there are situations where swap is required.\n\nHaving said that - I have a 2011 laptop with 12GB of RAM.  I haven't run with a swap file for about 3 years, under various distros and workloads, and have never had a problem.\n\nDuring this time, I've done light video editing, various compilation tasks, the usual internet activities, quite a bit of gaming (including some relatively beefy games - like WarThunder) and a lot of this and that.  Nothing super heavy like 3D modeling, but quite a bit more than just surfing the web and writing docs.\n\nI think if you are doing the kinds of tasks where you know you are going to run out of physical RAM, or as noted by /u/archontwo you plan to hibernate, then sure.  But my personal threshold (only because I was scared to try it at 8GB) is that from 12GB on up, even with a "heavy" desktop environment (I run Plasma 5, but have also run GNOME during this time), most people don't need it.
Good luck on your search.  \n\n\nJust looking at your flair, I've heard good things about Plum topre clones also, but no first hand experience.
> i think in some cases, the person might still be transitioning and not "convincingly" (for lack of a better word) presenting as their chosen gender. forcing them to use their birth certificate gender bathroom would fly in the face of everything they are trying to achieve.\n> \n> also, this seems like it could open up transgender students to de facto harassment by faculty who are aware of the child's birth certificate gender and hold a personal vendetta against transgender students.\n\nI get your first sentence.  But for the second, there are two possibilities:\n\n1)  The trans person can "pass" visually for the gender they are transitioning to.  In which case they can ignore any such laws, use the bathroom for that destination gender, and how would anyone know? \n\n2)  The trans person cannot "pass" for the gender they are transitioning to - in which case faculty (or whoever) that are inclined to harass them will probably do so no matter what bathroom they use.\n\nI don't see how knowledge of the birth gender makes a difference - again staff who know what's on a persons birth certificate are either decent people or they aren't.  They don't need to see what bathroom someone uses to decide to pick on them if they know anyway.\n\nLike others - I'm on the side of people using whatever bathroom makes them comfortable.  I'm not convinced that making a law about it makes a difference in practice though.
If I didn't want to wait, I'd buy it from that guy no question.  You don't see 100% positive feedback on 3000 transactions often.  So even if you don't like the board, it probably won't be his fault.  :-)

Sorry I somehow didn't see the rest of your comment when I replied the first time.\n\n>Nobody likes to go out with a bruise or a zit in the middle of their face.\n\nI think people are just different then.  He doesn't have to take my advice of course, I just wanted to be a voice for not feeling pressured to cover it up.\n\nI'd much rather go out with a bruise on my head than a bruise on my head covered with makeup.  I don't mean that in a "makeup is for women" way, I just mean I can't see caring about it enough to put that kind of effort into covering it up.  People get bruises.  And anyone who would think less of me for having one is not someone I really care about.\n\nBut still, I see your point.
EDIT: Spelling\n\nHere's a guide on disassembling the HHKB for the silencing ring and dome swap mods. \n\nhttps://blog.storeuni.com/keyboard/how-to-pfu-hhkb-disassembly-and-modding/\n\nThe MX compatible sliders will fit in the same holes that the stock Topre ones do with the exception of the larger stabilized keys. For the CM Novatouch slider mod, those actually require drilling holes in the case for the extra pegs on the MX sliders.

Well you do have a cool dad, it sounds like.  :-)\n\nThey are definitely on the quiet side.  If you type gently they will make almost no noise at all.  If you really hammer at them you can make them somewhat noisy, but I use one all day in a quiet office environment and no one has ever complained.\n\nThey are definitely not even in the same ballpark as MX Blues or other switches that are known for their clickiness.\n\nThe sound they make when you are pounding away on them is usually described as a "thock" by people.\n\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l1PwVrALgI) is a good video to give an idea.  Most of the vids I found have the gain up really high or otherwise don't give you a good impression of how they really sound, but this one nails it IMO.  I have an FC980C (same switches as the 660C) and this is pretty much how it sounds.
Spoken like someone young enough to think they will always have the "correct" reaction to everything that will happen in life.  And/or dumb enough to think there always *is* a correct reaction.

Linux Action Show has done a couple of recent segments on their setup, but I don't recall which episodes they were.\n\nI was going to tag the hosts here, but not sure they would appreciate that.  Suggest you post the same question over at /r/LinuxActionShow 
100% Agreed\n\n> I hope my dad gave me looks like that when I was younger. \n\nI hope my 12 year old knows that I do.  :-)\n\n
Old enough to use Google and Wikipedia though?  I mean, that's a pretty open ended question.\n\nIn far too few words:\n\nHe was the lead singer and songwriter of a band that was one of a small handful that created a new genre of Rock music, seemingly overnight, in the early 90s.  Nirvana was wildly popular, Kurt was young, good looking,talented, and had some problems, and was very well known as a result of all that...  Grunge was particularly well received because the general attitude of its performers contrasted so shockingly with 80's glam rock - it felt more "real" to many of us.\n\nNirvana is commonly cited as an influence on bands and musicians that have come since, just as earlier bands might have cited Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, etc.  (All of whom I hope are familiar names to you.)
That's when your keypress stops because the keycap hits the mounting point of the switch - it cannot physically go any further.\n\nSome people prefer to press the key only far enough for it to actuate and then release.  This is difficult to do with Topre.\n\nHaving said that, I love my Topre boards.  It's all I plan to buy in the future, despite that I have also been really happy with my other boards.\n\nThe feel and sound of bottoming out Topre is part of the enjoyment for me.\n\nThat said, you sound like you are new to all this - getting a Topre board right away is kind jumping into the deep end, unless you have money to burn.  Not everyone loves them, and they are among the most expensive boards unless you get into really exotic customs.
I have a post here from probably less than a year ago where I went from a couple million to 0 after buying some Tier V tanks and having a few bad games.  Currently I sit at just over 7 million.\n\nMy only suggestion is - sit at a lower tier for awhile and just have fun.  I've *mostly* tried to avoid anything over 6.7 since then, and have spent quite a lot of time in the 2 to 5.3 range - they build up faster than you might expect.
No, I definitely disagree.  My 980 is definitely thockier (and louder) than my RF, but NOT clicky.  The difference in thock volume is enough so that when I first switched at work I was self conscious about it for a few minutes.  It's still by no means loud, but I work in a pretty quiet environment.\n\nI found this video (link below) last week and linked it to someone else who was asking about the 980C.  This is a 660C in the video (very close to being identical minus some keys), but it's the **only** Leopold Topre video I've found that actually sounds like what I hear IRL.  (Obviously not my video - and I have nothing but crappy built in mics anyhow.)\n\nI don't know what it is that some people are doing with their mics or audio settings when they make these videos that they come out so clicky sounding - but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l1PwVrALgI) is very close to exactly what my 980C sounds like IRL.
The time immediately after the election actually taught me not to get so sucked in to what I was reading here on reddit.\n\nAlthough I do not doubt that some assholes felt encouraged and some people had a bad time because of it - after reading some of what was here I (a white guy) kinda left the house for a few days expecting non-white folks I interacted with (friends and strangers) to be standoffish or less friendly than usual, because reddit had me thinking this wave of racial tension was gripping the country.\n\nThen I went outside and went to the store and went to work, and everyone was just like they always are - normal people who I dealt with as individuals and who dealt with me the same way.\n\nActually during that time I had my first and only interaction  with a woman in a burka. (I live in an area where this is highly uncommon - I'm pretty sure I've never seen someone in a burka in person before.)  If ever there was someone who I thought might be not especially welcoming due to feeling persecuted, it was her.  And yet, we had a very pleasant chat.\n\nI've returned to my previous view that people are people.  And if you treat them with courtesy and respect, most of them will do the same in return.
Agreed.  I think I've jumped in a plane about 5 times in AB ground, just to see what it was like.  I didn't come to fly or shoot at planes, I came to drive and shoot at tanks.  If WT had stayed aircraft only I wouldn't be here.\n\nHaving said that, I reluctantly acknowledge that a lot of folks seem to like the "mixed combat" aspect.

I think owning it is a much better suggestion than covering it up.\n\nJust be the one to bring it up, have a laugh, it's done and over.\n\nHere's a mini-TIFU.\n\nGot dressed in near blackness one morning due to sleeping family and early workday.\n\nWas at work around an hour when I realized I'd put on two different shoes.\n\nNo way could I leave to go change one of them.\n\nSo I brought it up immediately whenever I had to interact with someone that day, threw in a little self deprecating humor, and in 10 seconds moved past it with very little embarrassment.\n\nAnd what I did was far stupider than what you did.  Just own it and laugh about it, don't cover it up.
My wife would drink nothing but Stoli for years.  Then due to advice from a friend, she branched out and tried Chopin.  That was her go to for a long while, but then on a whim she tried [Boyd & Blair](http://boydandblair.com/home/) (I don't remember what brought it to her attention), and that's been the *only* choice for her for about the past 6 or 7 years.\n\nIt's semi-local to us, so not sure how easy it is to get elsewhere.  I'm certainly not shitting on Stoli, but if you are looking to try something different, I recommend it - though I'm really a beer guy myself.

> I've had internet service since it was at 1mbps speeds. \n\nI've had it since most of us were running 14.4 kbps.  And I first got "online" (though I don't recall anyone calling it that back then) via BBSs at 300 baud.  ;-)\n\nWhile I generally agree with your post, this statement is much too absolutist, IMO:\n\n>Except for the periodic game download 50mbps is enough and no reason to pay more for faster speeds.\n\nI have a bittorrent client, sonarr, couchpotato, and sabnzbd running 24x7, in addition to the various streaming services we subscribe to.  And at times, I want those tools to get something ASAP because I didn't plan ahead - or I want things to come down *pretty fast* even while 2 or 3 of us are streaming HD content from netflix or hulu or whatever.  Or I have various other needs that pop up where I want to be able to suck up a large gob of bandwidth while those other things are also going on.\n\nCould we get by on 50mbps?  Sure we could.  But would I choose that instead of some faster choice?  No, I would not.\n\nI'm not suggesting that everyone else's requirements are the same as mine - but they probably aren't the same as yours, either.\n
I have both a regular HHKB + hyperspheres and a Type-S and they seem mostly similar. The silencing sounds basically the same for both. I'm not sure if it's all in my head, but the key feel seems a little better on the Type-S in that it feels like more of the key travel is present, where the Hyperspheres seem to reduce the travel a little more. \n\nIt may not be true, but I haven't measured the thickness of the stock silencers vs. the hyperspheres to verify. 
The one exception to this I've seen is my grandmother.  For decades she would decide she wanted to smoke every few days, pull out a cigarette, have a few puffs, put it out, and then *put it away* until a few days later when she wanted a few more puffs.\n\nMaybe that's still a very low level addiction, but if I could have kept my smoking to that level I'd never have bothered quitting.\n\nSide note in case you aren't a smoker - even smokers can't stand the smell of a stale butt that's been put out, nor the taste of one that has been relit.  So on the one hand I was always impressed by her control, but I was completely disgusted by how it was manifested.\n\nI do think she could have fully quit had she wanted to, but I can't say for sure, and I definitely think she's an exception.
Side note - what's the "M" designator mean?
And hence, they seek out warmth.
No worries.  Not necessarily trying to sell you on my glo, but IIRC the glo hd has higher resolution (debatable how much benefit that brings) and to my knowledge gives you the entire storage space for sideloading - which may not matter to you if you don't plan to sideload.\n\nIn any case, when buying things like this for my wife, I usually prefer something shrinkwrapped with some kind of warranty so no problem, I get it.  :-)
Sure sure.  I'm just saying that in my 46 years (many of which as a smoker) it definitely seems like far more than half of smokers have a hard time quitting, to me.  \n\nIt's totally anecdotal, I'm not doubting your figure - but IME easily 90% of quitters are smoking again within a couple of months or (sometimes much) less.
I think it was the "Why the hell?" opener to your prior comment.
I've got a 20" Trinitron under my desk at work that you can have when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.  I haven't used it in about a year, but I still think it's got a nicer picture than anything else I've seen.

Next you're going to tell me that the rainbow was added in post processing also.  I'm not buying it!
I should mention - I always made sure to keep her head out of the towel when wrapping her up - almost like swaddling a baby.\n\nI don't know if this is really important or not, but it always seemed to me she'd be potentially traumatized if I basically wrapped a bag around her.  \n\nIt should be pretty easy in most situations to get them wrapped up quickly but gently if you have a decent sized towel.  You do want to ensure the legs get fully covered and enclosed - or you'll still get the stray swipe.
Thanks :-)
Oh I've been waiting for something like this since MW3.  \n\nI'd *still play* MW3 if anyone else was playing.\n\nDoes it have slower heavies or is it all pretty frantic like this?  I'm happy either way, but I did enjoy some of the slower moving gigantic lumbering mechs in MW3...  (I think the only mech game I played after that was the Xbox Mechwarrior game, which I found really disappointing.)
I'm sorry for being *that guy*, and doubly so if English is not your primary language - but the word you are looking for all through that post is "clothes."\n\nBy the 4th time it was almost painful.  :-)
Thanks for the detailed response.  I've been taking some time to mull over some of the others, so haven't been very participatory in the thread, but I am finding all the replies to be interesting.\n\nIt seems the short answer is that I'm wrong to think western feminists don't consider forced covering to be an issue (likely due to being an "outsider" to the feminist movement), but also that I'm likely wrong to think there is much that can reasonably be done from "over here" while remaining respectful of other cultures.  
We (the US) need more exchanges like this.  A hearty pat on the back to both you and /u/carsonshall.
>Also, you recommend water quenching 1084. This will cool it off too quickly. Oil quench 1084 if you want durable blades.\n\nDid he edit the captions of the photos after you posted this or am I missing something?  Where he discusses quenching he says this:\n\n>Once the blade is knife shaped, it's time for the heat treat. Part one of the heat treat is the quench. This converts the soft annealed steel into really hard and brittle martensite. 1084 steel is basically the perfect simple steel for home heat treatment since its made of .84% carbon which makes it perfectly eutectic. In layman's terms, this means, heat the blade up to 1500 degrees, **and quench it in oil**. Simple as that.
Except that plastic bottles were only opaque back then.

Nice, I have the same board but with mx clears and Modern Selectric caps.
Funny seeing you here. 
As far as I know, the heaviest Topre switches are the 55cN ones found on the Realforce 87U:\n\n* https://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rftenkeyless&pid=rf_se08t0\n* https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch#Variations\n\nI normally type on Cherry MX clears which are 65cN. However, after getting a Realforce 87U with the 55cN topres, I have to say that they feel comparable even though they are 10cN less. The 55's feel quite nice and snappy, and they sound quite good with the stock PBT caps.\n\nI've also tried a CM Novatouch and an HHKB Pro 2. The Novatouch feels the worst to me and the HHKB feels pretty good, except it's a little on the light side as far as the switches go since it's only 45cN.
Confirmed
EDIT: Living -> Lubing 
Hah that's excellent. They are dyed PBT caps from  /u/crj3012 
[EDIT: Spelling]\n\nThanks! \n\nYeah, I was lucky I think because like a week after I bought mine, they were sold out.
Cool, cool
Ok cool. Thanks for the info. \n\nBTW, are you going to do any more of those modifier sets that you have on those pictures of your past work? I really dig the dark purple mods. 
* The purple mods and SNES arrows are from /u/crj3012. \n* The white PBT space bar was from eBay. I may replace it with one of the PBT spacebars from the recent Massdrop sale once they get here.\n* I put the grey mod caps on row 1 for the 5 and 0 keys because I'm still a noob on blank keycaps.\n
Nice! Congrats on also getting some cool caps. They would probably go really well on a black HHKB, but I don't have one. I think they still look pretty good.
Thanks for the feedback. This is sort of where I'm at as well. I now own an HHKB Pro 2 and a Realforce 87U 55g. Both are very nice and neither of them ping or anything like that. The only issue is that I can't use my various keycap sets with Topre, but I suppose that's the price I pay.
Hmm, kind of hard to say. \n\nI like them all in different ways. I like how portable the HHKB is and I usually take it to work with me since I have the handy carrying case for it. It's one of my favorites in terms of the way it looks as well. Even though it's silenced with hypersphere rings, it still feels pretty snappy and has a nice sound profile. \n\nFor the Realforce, I love the 55g domes. They feel incredibly tactile and snappy. It has a fantastic sound to it even without hyperspheres. I also like the retro beige look of it. The o Lynda thing that I think I may do at some point is get one of those nice Pexon detachable cables for it. \n\nThe novatouch was actually my first Topre board. I got it after lurking around on here. At first I didn't really like it. It had a rattly sound to it and it wasn't all that quiet. After lubing and silencing though, it's very nice and I came to appreciate the feels. I found the "good feeling of oneness with cup rubber."

I checked on their site, but I didn't see any "Jazz" themed caps there under the collections. I saw the Rick and Morty ones, and a ton of others though. Unfortunately, those all seem to be MX mount.
Hmm ok. Well I mentioned the dark purple mods, but what others do you have?
Yeah me too. The SNES was my favorite console and I like the nods and throwbacks to it that I see with some people's setups and wanted to have my own. 
Not sure about that one. HHKBs are already pretty quiet compared to their MX counterparts. Not really sure why you would need to put that in there. 
I own both of these boards and I like them both for different reasons. I'm normally used to heavier switches such as Cherry MX blacks and Clears.\n\n* **Realforce 87U 55g**\nThis is one of my all time favorite boards for sure. I really love the snappiness and the heavier 55g domes. I wouldn't really describe the 87U 55g as scratchy at all. I haven't lubed the stabilizers or anything since I got it. It's completely stock, and even still I really like the feel. I haven't used this for gaming though, so I can't really say how well it performs for that. I would think that it may get tiring though due to the heavier domes.\n\n* **HHKB Pro 2**\nI also really like the HHKB Pro 2, but I like it a little less than the 87U 55g. I have lubed and hypersphered mine and it's very nice. I still think that it feels less substantial and snappy than the Realforce. The 45g domes would probably be better for long gaming sessions though. \n\nAs an alternative, there is the Realforce 87U 45g "EK" edition which is a standard TKL, but has 45g domes instead of 55g. I have heard some people complain that this model is a little mushy feeling compared to the 55g, but not having used it, I can't really say.
Meant to reply directly to your comment, but accidentally just made a regular one. \n\n"I like it. It has a different feel than the Realforce or the HHKB. Lubed and silenced, I would says that it's the quietest of the three. I haven't silenced the Realforce, so I'm not sure if it would be quieter. \n\nThe feeling is just as smooth as HHKB, but it's more similar to the to the Realforce since it has a metal mounting plate. It is a bit less snappy when compared to the HHKB. \n\nThe best part for me is that I can use standard MX caps with it. "

Time to shop for camo shoes
Price would be a big factor, but this looks interesting.
No idea abt Max's keycaps, but I've tried Taihao ABS. Again not the best quality, but slightly better than stock, a lot of colour options and fairly cheap.
It's nice
I like it for gaming but not for word processing.
This is worse than 9gag in some ways
Peru and pinoys are way worse. They don't play to win.
I zoomed in to check if the chopsticks dripped soup on the caps.\n\nWe're fine, boys.
Void carry has been around for 10 years
Three, including a faulty Ducky Zero. Might try to fix it and give it away, though PCB damage seems hard to deal with.
They are great 
A group of nice and helpful people who shares my interests? All of you are my ^^^^only friends now!
Pick me
They do, but Topre does it better since they've been perfecting it for years.
Haven't tried the 660c extensively to make a judgment, but the 980c build quality is said to be better. The materials and assembly is done by the same manufacturers of RealForce, whereas 660 is made in China/Taiwan.
Nope, he didn't have the fins in the bed scene, so he got it a while after being adopted.
lol
Hope Good Smile makes the next figure. They usually cost around the same and the quality is a lot better.
It looks like a winkeyless.kr b87r, with a black + clear + frosted acrylic case. Probably the most affordable korean custom board out there.\n\nKeycaps should be SA but not sure which ones.
iRocks & Plum?
Could I disassemble a Pok3r RGB and just put it on this, or do I have to use a B face/Zeal60 PCB?\n\nSorry if it's a dumb question I'm not really familiar with 60% kbs.
It's on my flair: Leopold FC980C!
Hey that's static storm
It has gotten to a point where I get goosebumps from reading *the word*.
It's been 9 hours, I think OP is dead.
Is it worth it? Been looking for a volume knob and this one's aesthetics is the best so far.
Talking about TI1-2, Navi won TI but back then the Chinese were better than all the other teams.
Otaku got restocked recently too.
What's up with the grooves on top of the bezel? Looks a bit odd, could be the photo angle though.
Quite a few, actually.
No worthy trades anywhere, only people who want to trade are looking to make a big profit or get cash and bypass the Valve market tax.
Compact fullsized with left handed numpad\n\n67g Zealios Alphas, Topre for 3u+ modifiers, 62g Zealios for Modifiers & numpad.\n\nMarble Casing with gold cross screws, carbon fibre plate and a minimalistic steel tray (w a LED strip on the side & rubber feet underneath) to hold the marble in place.
I've seen some affordable zinc-coated caps, but they seem terrible.
Very impressive.
>typingme.com  \n\nDamn, as someone who never uses his pinky, this is a lot harder than it looks. \n\nOn a side note, I'm looking for a good typing game on steam, anyone got recommendations? 
Nice Dota mat, GLWS
The power of branding™
Gonna wait for some reviews first, from what I've read Ducky's QC hasn't been the best for a while.
Really hope they can release dates on major events like TI sooner. Makes it easier for orgs to host other events and let's us wage slaves to apply for annual leave.
We could be telling you to get a Razer or HHKB Lite
>life savings\n\nWhat's that? Is it MX or Topre compatible?
I recall hearing the old C9 team farming Challenger League spots and selling them.\n\nAs with anything Riot, it seems to be poorly thought-out and exists to be abused.
I wouldn't get it personally, but if it helps him get the jump on someone with Euls or Cold Snap, it's justifiable.
It is a group buy, which is why I assume the price is lower.\n\nOr it's not the "genuine" HolyOops cap, can't really tell.
The Red Woman
Depends on how well you like the mouse and the total price. Personally I think a fair price for both items combined would be 70$, but that's probably half of what they sell for.\n\nBut really, I wouldn't recommend any Razer products. They suck.
Filco is nicer for sure 
DSA Tidehunter
Damn the blue version looks pretty nice.
It's more along the lines of "do we have cocaine or weed to plant on people we want to arrest"
Test some switches at a shop or get a switch tester first, they probably cost $10-15?\n\nIf you're gonna spend 150 you might as well make sure you get something you won't regret on. (y)
They aren't actually units that you can interact with, it's just a visual effect, just like CM's.
The original comment's point was that it's ridiculous to compare them to Meepo's clones since MK's "clones" are so different. \n\nToo hard to understand? In other words, if you really have to make a comparison, you might as well compare it to a CM ult.\n\nWhy are you saying it is coded like a hero? Is it because of the attack modifiers? Then ok, is PA's dagger coded like a hero too? The whole point is that **MK's ult acts more like a spell than a real clone.** Yes it has some aspects of a hero clone but it's not an *actual meepo clone* - you can't interact with it, so it's more comparable to a spell.\n\nI don't know in how many more ways I can explain the same shit over again. Why are you getting triggered over semantics
It's great
It's not like it couldn't happen with Dota, in the past the Chinese have been very dominant. \n\nJust that Riot's model of regional competition makes it hard for the Western teams to improve and there is literally no incentive to be the best. You just get a tiny bit more for winning IEM or even Worlds, whereas winning TI is actually a life-changing event.
Try Keyboardco? I've ordered from them before and it worked out fine.
So as a buyer from Asia I'm assuming I don't need to fill in your form?\n\nNot too familiar with Chinese proxies and their payment methods, I'll keep my eyes out for your updates.
But they aren't actual clones like Meepo, that's what the original comment referred to.\n\nI'd argue that they are more comparable to CM ult since you can only interact w them by walking away, whereas Meepo clones can be stunned and killed.
His new looks are a lot better than expected, I thought he was half cyborg like Darth Vader or some shit, especially since he's "Vidar".
Nowhere as popular as full-sized, TKL or 60%. It's kind of for people who want a shorter kb but retain the Fn row, numpad and arrows.\n\nWhat switches are you swapping into?
322
As is tradition
Not impossible to find a bilingual editor
Light beige, looks really nice irl
256 USD. Compared to other Topre boards, it's a reasonable price...probably
Gonna fill in the form today or tomorrow!
Nice to see someone who uses arrow clusters. I can't imagine giving them up.
+1 for 1800\n\nHell it doesn't even need to be fancy, i just want a wrist rest that sits snug to my 980c.
On the other hand, farming the enemy jungle can be good if they have SF mid and weak/stationary side lanes.
The problems is that it's very hard to make sure everyone's rooms gets viewed ~ the same number of times, that's why OP says it's RNG based.\n\nWould be nice to see some stats on how many people viewed your room & voted.
Thought it didn't submit on my mobile so I did it again. Hopefully I didn't double order :x\n\n

I guess it's pretty expensive to pay for a geneticist in ancient China.
I regret telling my colleagues how much I paid for my new kb.\n\n>"So...what's so special about it"\n\n>**Inner voice: It's a made-in-Japan 45g Topre  keyboard in 1800-layout with dye-sub PBT keycaps and a custom space bar"*\n\n>...\n\n>"Well, it feels nice"\n
No it does not
Let me know too, so I can buy more useless shit I don't need
Definitely, you could have a battlefury against megas, but it really depends on how rich your BM is.
I think FC900 is the full sized one, not sure
The damage do come from the  icicles, what the fuck are you talking about?\n\nI'll say this again, icicles or MK clones aren't *actual* units that you can interact with, it's just a visual effect.
Don't you have to get it rather young? I recall Hush being called too old to have the surgery.\n\nI guess it's just a matter of effectiveness, since Ein got it anyways.
PSA: If you're in Asia, it might be better to wait and order directly from Good Smile. \n\nShipping from WeLoveFine took fucking forever.
Probably talking about the sponsor eagle abuse, which isn't the most game-breaking one. It gives a measly number of views compared to the new view buffs, and you have to have no life to gain a sizeable benefit from it.
Someone needs to make a GN drive keycap
Which one of their morons came up with this stupid name this time
That's actually pretty good.
Maybe get a white backlit keyboard and add on purple LED covers? That way you don't have to shell another 30-40 USD for RGB.
He's suggesting the same "free placement" but with grids to guide you
Filco is great, especially if you have nice keycaps to compliment it. Stock caps are a bit too thin imo.
lol thank god I don't browse new
It doesn't make any sense, but it's iconic and I liked it.
He just went to look for his end-game

The FC980C is made by the Japanese RealForce manufacturers, but designed and commissioned by Leopold.\n\nNot sure how many Leopolds are made in Korea. For one, the FC660C is made in China.
Lyte Smite lul\n\nAt least that asshole is finally exposed
I work in recruiting so I am emailing with managers and taking notes all day on candidates.  Lots of typing.  But I can't get enough!  Will have to start writing or something. 
My wife ordered it. I will try to find out where and reply
Switches??
Only had it for a day but I love the way it looks and feels. I'm guessing I won't be regretting it. 
I loved my cherry greens and still do in fact.  I actually will not buy a MX board without greens anymore.  I would love to get a magicforce but have never seen one with greens.  All that to say that once I ordered my Realforce 87u 55g I fell in love.  I find that I am much faster and more accurate on the topre board.  But I still love cherry greens and wouldn't mind trying clears at some point as well.  I guess you just have to try and see.
So happy for you man!  
Ok I'll have to check tomorrow on a desktop. When searching for Topre Leopold in their advanced search it says no results. Hoping it's just stock. 
That's what makes me wonder 
Thanks. I did finally notice that. Will have to pick one up. 
This looks great!  I have the same board. Love it. I have never used a GMK set. Thinking I'm gonna have to change that. 
Can't wait to see the build!
Thanks. I didn't realize the rev 4 comes with the firmware already installed. That's good to know. 
I don't know that I believe in actual end game but wow is this close!  If only you could get the fc660c with 55g domes. 
Thanks. I am hoping I can try a lot of different switches at keycon. 
Headed there now to vote. Thanks!
Thanks. I'm setting a reminder for myself in November then to check and buy one. 
That is a great way to put it. Thanks for he info. I think I'm gonna have to get that fc660c now. 
Realforce 87u 55g all the way. Got mine about 3 weeks ago and can't stop using it. The only time now that I use my pok3r with MX blues is when I'm at work cause it's already there and even than I'm going to get a sleeve and starting taking the 87u to work as well. \n\nThat said; I haven't used either of the other two though I am thinking about getting the fc660c.  
Absolutely getting that!  Thanks!
This Realforce is a lot quieter than my MX greens were and I used to use those to talk notes with.  But I think it's a good thing actually.  I like the candidates to know that I am taking notes and if they can stay focused on what they are saying while my keyboard is clacking away then I know they have the focus we are looking for.
Where did you get the 55g domes?  I saw someone on the Plum 87 massdrop discussion page link to a sheet from ebay but wanted to get a little more info before ordering it.  I jumped on the drop but haven't ordered the sheet yet.  Any info is appreciated.  Thanks
Oh nice!  I didn't even think of that.  Guess I will be spending a bit of money.  Oh well.  Thanks
Have been wanting something like this for a while. Subscribed. Nice work. 
And I think I'm really digging the green legends on white 
I wish I had known these were going to be going on sale.  I paid twice as much a couple months ago.  Oh well I guess.  Nice colors.
I was this but really want the white and gray variant. I keep checking mechanicalkeyboards.com every other day for it to be back in stock. 
You guys are killing my decision making here. I was all set to order a custom TKL from Varmilo and then I see this.  Might have to go with that Quickfire Rapid. 
Are there any tutorial videos out there for customizing files for WASD.com?  I am on a mac, downloaded the program they suggest (ink-something), but have no design software experience. However would love to customize something for some of my boards. Thanks for any info. 
I absolutely love me 87u with 55g. It's my favorite and nothing else is near as good. That said I favorite backup board is a varmilo with MX greens. And the only reason I'm using hat one right now is because I want to use my SA Jukebox caps that just came in. I can't say that would would be happy with the cleats cause I've never used them but I still love my greens (even if it's a backup). 
I just got a Realforce 87u 55g and instantly fell in love. I'm not sure I'm going to be doing a ton of tying on my MX boards actually. However I am now thinking about getting the fc660c for more of a compact Topre. What are your thoughts on the 55g vs 45g Topres?\nThanks
Looks amazing!  What color code are those mods?
Hearing that a lot. Thanks

Looks amazing. I have jukebox coming but I really think Carbon SA on my Varmilo va68m is going to be endgame. 
I really want a 75% next but I fell in love with the MX clears on my new Vortex Core and would really love to have a 75% with clears.  7ave not seen anything like that yet.  Or maybe greens.  I love a heavier switch.
Where did you buy it from?
Yeah it is the same color and material. Perfect match!
Thanks. I was looking at their's for a 60% sleeve but might reach out to see what it would cost to have a special one made. 
Well thank you!  He gets most of it from him mama I'm sure. 
Thanks. I will set a reminder and check back there on the 9th
This is great info thanks. I am not a fan of linear so I really think I will be tackling this as well. Thanks again.
That is fantastic.  Anyway you could post the tutorial?  Thanks!
I'm not a very lingual person. Think I will have to wait. Thanks is for the info though. 
I'm pretty sure they are the exact same board. The only difference is the keycaps which you would be able to customize on the WASD
I had to work remotely yesterday and didn't have room in my bag for a mech while on the motorcycle so had to use my MBP keyboard as well. Typing with tears in your eyes is not easy. 
Do you know if that will be the kit or assembled?
This past January I was scrolling through Instagram and happened to see someone I follow had a Varmilo vb68m with carbon caps and instantly fell in love. Started researching and found all the different options. Now I have 4 boards and another that should arrive today actually. Can't wait to get home everyday and check this sub. 
Yeah I can't wait until we can watch it together!
It sounds like you're mind is made up here but I have to chime in cause I will honestly not pass up an opportunity to talk about how much I love you Realforce 87u 55g. I don't hate cherry as much as you. In fact I actually quite like heavier greens but I would be ok if I never got another board now that I have the 87u. I'm not a very fast typer but my accuracy (and subsequently speed) greatly increased when I got it. \n\nI was still thinking about picking up the fc660c for travel. \n\nAt any rate let us know what your final decision is once you get it. 
So I have been thinking about this for a long time. Fight Club is one of my favorite movies (if not my absolute favorite). What do you guys think?  I'm not sure the colors are just right and I may have gone overboard with replacing the legends but I really like it so far. Open for suggestions. Thanks 
Well to an extent yes but their caps are not quite as good. I am pretty sure they use ABS caps. If you want a better quality you are better off getting the Pok3r and getting a high quality PBT keycaps set. But that is going to cost you more and take longer. Totally up to how much you want to spend and fast you want it complete (by the way boards are never complete!). 
Thanks for asking the question and all the info.  I have been thinking about ordering a fc660c from them for a little while now.  Think I will pull the trigger. 
Yeah I'm on that Plum 87 drop right now. Wondering if I should cancel and look for a used HHKB. But I still think I would be spending more money. Decisions decisions...
Thanks.  I really want a Topre board (specifically this board) but think the 45g actuation would be too light and don't think this board comes with the 55g.
Exactly correct 
Thanks. I think I could handle the soldering but it would be the programming and flashing that I would have problems with. Have never done anything like that. 
Thanks so much for the info. This is going to help a lot. I have the 55g 87u right now and was a little worried about the 35g domes on the Plum. 
How difficult was it to switch out the domes?  I have a Plum 87 on the way and was planing on getting 55g domes off eBay. 
I saw the JD40 PCB on techkeys but where do you get the case for it?  Would love to pick one of these up. Also is there any videos out there showing how to flash the firmware onto it?  I have absolutely no programming experience. 
Well I think I'm going to get the minivan as well but just exciting that the 40% might grow a bit in popularity. Pretty cool. 
I hope my comments help you but I don't have a lot of comparison.  I can say that I just received my Realforce 87u 3 days ago and it is by far the best board I have ever used.  That said I am now planing on getting a FC660C as [well](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1495).  
Yeah thats kinda what I was thinking.  However I have never hand wired a board and wouldn't even know where to start.\nThanks for the info
Absolutely amazing. Liking the top layout 
Really!?  To each his/her own but I got the RF 87u 55g and loved it so much.  This is actually why I wanted to get the fc660c so that I had a more travel friendly Topre board.  But I see that you have MX greens as well.  Those are my 2nd favorite.  
You are right, there is a lot still to be said but Vortex if you are listening (and I know you're probably not: BOTH (blanks and legends), VARIOUS COLORS, and HURRY!!!!!!
I have extremely heavy fingers and just prefer the feel of a heavier switch.  I have MX greens on another board and love them.  Just thinking that I would like a heavier Topre as well.
Yes I really hope there is another one. I'm so disappointed that I'll be out of town. I was looking forward to keycon last year in Chicago and missed that as well. I have been trying to get anyone interested in mechanical keyboards with no luck. It sucks not being able to talk to anyone about it. \n\nStill super bummed. Have a great time everyone and hope to see you at the next one. 
This is great thank you.  Looks like I have more money to spend.
Wish I could upvote your comment more than once. Great info here. Even if there is a lot of opinion. 
Upvote for the last photo alone. Madman with a board. 
Just myself got a QFR with browns. Where would I get an aluminum case for it?
I got enough to cover a full size board (even though I dont have a full size board) so i had enough for a numpad and i think all in i paid about $115 or there abouts.
I have to second that. I am very much not an artisan person but this is amazing 
Wow that sucks.  Thanks for the info.
Yeah I would love to use that font. That was my original idea but didn't know if I could do that with keyboard layout editor. \n\nGood call on moving "Tyler" to the escape key. 
Pm'ed
Thank you.  I have the same alphas with darker gray mods.  Same color codes and granite.  But I might have to pick up some of these mods.  Looks so good.
Such an amazing set. Have lusted for it ever sense getting into the community. 
I just got this board myself. Not my first but my first with browns. Loving browns way more than I thought I would. Hope it works out for you. 
I have the same case on my pok3r. Love it. Looks good with the coffee keyset. 
After getting my Realforce I really wanted to get that board but mechanicalkeyboards.com only has the black with all gray keys.  Really wanted the white with gray mods.  Have been waiting for it to be restocked but I might cave and get the black one.
Thanks.  Will take a crack at it.
I have wanted to set up a macro board for a while now but never knew what to set them to do. Why do you have the other keys do? And do you have a build log for that thing?  Like looks great 
Terminal DIN plug. Soarers converter or phosphorglow Controller. 
Good suggestions.  And if you need it to be even more quiet then get some o-rings.  This will help a lot but keep in mind that it will reduce some of the key travel.  
Yeah this looks amazing!!  Love the movie. Love the set. Would totally be in if this gets the green light. 
Was anyone else aware of this?  I'm very interested. And in the comments on they said it could be here as early as the end of this month!
Amazing work!  I would put this on my insert key because everyone needs to have a little more beauty in their life.  
Ha!  You are talking a different language so I don't know if that's a thing or a joke. But that would be awesome if you wanted to make a tutorial. Wish I had the skill. 
Thanks!  Man that red would go really well with the jukebox set I have coming in November. But not sure I want to spend that much. Decisions decisions...
I used to live in the city but now I'm in Highland Park. I work in the city though so I'm around all the time. I would also love to help out planing for the next one as well. Just let me know how this one goes and maybe we can get something together in the near future. Thanks!
> 55g RC930\n\nWhere do you get something like that and how much do they cost??  I absolutely love my Realforce 87u 55g and would love something similar that would accept cherry caps.
Super bummed but I will be out of town that weekend.  Be sure to let us know if you do another at a later date.
Awesome. Thank you. And I'm just going to order it as soon as it's back in stock. Just to be safe. 
So if I changed the title would I be ok?  A bit confused sorry. Just wanted to post a pic of my son in a little doctor who outfit. 
Typing this response on a Pok3r with Dye-sub caps from Signature Plastics and just put it all in a iquints lambo case 3 days ago.  This is my 60% endgame and I love this board.  I would start with the Pok3r if I were you.  Great board.  Now I'm tackling a TKL next.
That's awesome. Exactly what I want. I'll reach out and wait. Thanks. Great looking board by the way. 
Ah well that's not going to do much. Thanks 
That makes two of us. Really would love to meet some people around the area that are as crazy as I am. 
I just got an HHKB from them with 2 esc keys and the shipping was $13.61 for FedEx ground. 
Looking for a meet up in Sydney, Aus!\n\nHappy to help out where I can organising it. 
Is it really a HHKB if the bottom row isn't upside down?
Pick me!
Also, would you happen to know if there's a way to replace the switch/stem with a cross mount stabilizer? The way that space bars have additional mounts that look like switches but are actually just supportive plastic crosses? What is that even called??
I have disabled these switches, but rollover is still a problem. At a circuit level.
In that case you'll need a hardware solution.
Thanks. Very helpful. I think I will be buying a desoldering pump...
Seems to agree with research I've done on the Cherry RC/Tipro POS boards in the past few minutes. I will need to desolder. 
POS keyboards' plates don't support switch top opening though. Most mass produced keyboards don't. Switch top opening is a hobbyist feature.
Do you have a tutorial or image that would help me understand what to do?
I did the same thing, but I created a new account quickly after tutorial island.
I don't know of any way to do that, but there's no need to either. The additional mounts on a spacebar can be called stabiliser mounts and they have the same dimensions as the switch mounts. Stabiliser and switch stems are also identical. In case you don't know, stabilisers always come in pairs and are a mechanism to, well, stabilise a key. They are connected via a stiff metal wire that will pull down one end of the switch when the opposite end is pressed.\r\n\r\nIf you replaced those stabilisers with keys, which is possible in theory, you lose that function. For small keys it would still work, but then you are pressing multiple switches down at the same time. This is precisely how a POS board like yours is designed. There are special keycaps that take up that space of two or four keys, and those are practically stabilised by the keys instead of actual stabilisers. Hope that was helpful.
On a POS board you can usually disable switches in some kind of configuration software. 
Thanks. I understand now. This is more feedback for the Windows folks but good feedback nonetheless. I will submit this to them if it isn't already being tracked.
PMing
Thank you. So would those "two more on the outside edge" allow for mounting over two 1u switches? I'm trying to make a numpad work on an ortholinear board
I don't understand.  What's the different between Momentary Press and Momentary AND Press?

Hi there.  Scott from the OneNote team here.  This shouldn't be happening - I am going to suggest that AvocadoOfDestiny might be correct in saying this is a University policy issue.  However, if you have any more specifics on your problem, send me a private message and I will see what I can do to help.
Hi, Scott from the OneNote team here.  Ya know, a much newer version of OneNote is available for free?  Visit http://www.onenote.com/download for more.  We've added lots of new features since 2007 :) 
Hi, Scott from the OneNote team here.  We've recently added a Move/Copy feature to OneNote on Windows 10 for pages and sections.  Sorry it took so long to ship this feature, but please know that we are trying our best to respond to customer requests as quickly as possible.
Very helpful reply.  Thanks!\n\nDo you have any recommendations for non-Cherry matrix keyboards with MX-style switches?  I've seen the "Genovation ControlPad" on Amazon but that's about it.  Something more akin to the link in my OP would be ideal.\n\nEDIT: I guess I should search for ortholinear in this subreddit and see what appears ?\n\n
This is not something I have heard a lot about. I will look into it. 
Post those keycaps in /r/mechanicalkeyboards

Hey there dguidrywe. ScottSn from the OneNote team here. Would you mind starting a conversation via PM with me? Someone on our team may be able to look into this issue but I think I'll need answers to a few questions. Thanks and sorry you've been experiencing issues. 
What do people think of the MOD switches? Anything I could mentally compare them to?
Hi Thedicktator. What do you mean by this? OneDrive vs another cloud storage provider?
Hey there.  Scott from the OneNote team here.  We have an update coming **very soon** that should make you pretty happy. That's all I can really say though.
We've heard this one too. We understand that Previews don't work for everyone and are looking into it.

Sorry but currently you can only record or takes text notes with the iOS clients. You can't do both simultaneously.  Similar to the implementation on Windows Phone 8.1. 
who is the creator?
Hey oryp35,  I just wanted to add a reply to let you know that we released an update last week for "Full Screen Drawing."  It covers the taskbar, gives you quick access to pens, slimmer ribbon, etc.  More updates coming soon!
Thank you!!
Man that right Shift size is hard to find. I have a TADA68 all decked out save for that one key. I have a blank 1.75 instead of a 1.75 Shift with a legend :/
keep up the good work jchan!
From what I can tell, PMK does 1x2, but doesn't do 2x2 or 3x2. Do you know if maybe they have these sizes, just not at the moment?
Are you talking about audio recording? We do have this feature on iPad and iPhone. 
Gotcha.  Thanks for getting back to me with details, it helps to understand users' scenarios.  I've spoken to a co-worker and we're tracking this feature request.  
Hi there,Scott from the OneNote team here. Try out IFTTT. I'm not exactly sure if it is what you're looking for, but with IFTTT you can programmatically create a new OneNote page from a website given a trigger like date and time. 
Yes, I've been on the team for quite a while now :)
Do you ever get confused with Vinesauce? Also I love your speed runs. 
I can't comment on what we are specifically working on, but know that we have heard a LOT of feedback from Surface users about the superiority of inking in a the full screen mode from the 8.1 version. My understanding is that users want something that feels more akin to a blank sheet of paper. The fewer bars the better. We hear the feedback and are considering options to alleviate this pain. As I have said in some other places, please stay tuned and try to look forward to impending updates. 
Purchased POS caps from /u/justjeepin
Hi this is ScottSn from the OneNote engineering team. If OneNote is requiring you to be online, that sounds like a bug I'd like to get fixed. Would you be willing to send me a private message to discuss one on one?
Is the MID series only PS2?  I have heard the PS/2-only models will be a nightmare to program :/
Hi - Scott from the OneNote team here.  If it's just you in a notebook and you're still seeing bold, it probably means you have different "names" on different devices.  \n\nIn OneNote 201x, visit File > Options > Personalize your copy of Microsoft Office.  You can change your name to anything - make sure it matches the name on your phone/tablet.
Received em within a week. 
That was so awesome. Thanks for sharing. 
That's interesting.  I have access to a laser cutter.  Not sure if that material is safe to cut but I could probably get it very exact.
They are the Gorton Modified DSAs on PMK: http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-sublimated-keycap-sets/\n\nI chose WFJ (white) and RAR (red). I would have preferred white text for the legends on the red keys but it wasn't available. \n\nAlso notice the right shift and right mods are blank because they aren't included in that set. I purchased some additional red blanks to use instead. \n\nThe four colored key caps on the right are just deep dish keys in various colors from PMK.

Hey SgtDirtyMike,  I just wanted to add a reply to let you know that we released an update last week for "Full Screen Drawing."  It covers the taskbar, gives you quick access to pens, slimmer ribbon, etc.  Just the first of many updates we are working on!
Thank you!
Yeah I remember now - I went TKL mods so I would have arrow keys! 60% doesn't come with those. 
Note that you can force a manual sync. Right click on a notebook in the left hand pane. It will be available in the contex menu. All your other feedback is noted and in line with what lots of folks have been saying. I appreciate you taking the time to write it all up.
ScottSn from the OneNote team here. \n\nWe are aware of this bug and working on a fix. Please make sure you have automatic app updates on so you can get our fix when we release it. \n\nSorry for the inconvenience :/ But thank you for the feedback, it helps us get better. 
Hey ShadwChsr,  I just wanted to add a reply to let you know that we released an update last week for "Full Screen Drawing."  It covers the taskbar, gives you quick access to pens, etc.  More updates soon!\n\nEdit: You should also be able to add camera photos now as well.  There are some other updates like better spell check too.  As I said, more coming soon so please stay tuned,
Yeah I know :/ \nGot a 1993 ALPS there once though. 
Yeah I just realized a typical Backspace is a 2u and took a look. Three stems. Thank you. 
I used to be really against screen protectors. But now I have one on my phone and one on my tablet and I love them. A good screen protector is invisible, eliminates glare and reflections, and absorbs grease from fingers/stylus. 
Thanks. Helpful. I have access to a 3D printer for free at work but haven't used it yet. \n\nIn total I'll probably need 30 to 40 keys. Is this a totally unreasonable number? \n\nAlso, do you think a beginner 3D modeler could modify what's on Thingiverse to take the 1u models and turn them into 2x2? This is maybe what I am most worried about. 
Curious if anyone has purchased and what they think of the set. How is the quality? Would you recommend? \n\nI'm particularly interested in the 40% mods. Not a huge fan of the alphas lettering. 
Are you looking to sell the Leopold? 
I want this so badly!
Don't bring this to school or you might be accused of cyberterrorism
Declaring interest!
Just proves that the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide are real. 
And Windows Phone!
Again, thanks.  This is a lot of interesting information.  I'm hunting down a Tipro 128 or Cherry RC128 as we speak.
It's almost like they said "ok so tracking isn't working, let's just remove the feature" and then "we removed the feature and it didn't help the backlash, let's just remove the rest of the features and see if that helps" 🙏
They are Gorton Modified from PMK. Check my other comment in this thread to see more details. \n\nAnd yeah the stock caps on the TADA are REAL nice. Just not very colorful 😬
Link to song at the beginning?
Hey TristanN47, I just wanted to add a reply to let you know that we released an update last week for "Full Screen Drawing."  It covers the taskbar, gives you quick access to pens, slimmer ribbon, etc.  And more updates to OneNote coming soon.  Hopefully you're willing to give Windows 10 another chance in the near future.
Ah ok. Do you know if the caps are replaceable with other MX compatible caps?

Hey there horyo,\n\nI work on the OneNote team here at Microsoft. I'm interested in some details around your error. If you're interested in helping us fix this issue, could you please send me a private message?  I'll explain more there.\n\nThanks,\nScottSn\n\nEDIT: Grammar
Hey ziekke, I have heard this a few times, but would you mind providing some details on specifically why this is important to you? Privacy concerns? Or maybe another reason?
/r/meow_irl
Bought the white 60% base, red TKL mods, and a few red blanks and the multicolored keys and a spacebar (eventually switched back to white spacebar though). Probably could have gotten away with 60% mods instead of TKL but now I have some extras. \n\nI got my TADA with blanks and am keeping them, sorry :)
Better ingredients, better pizza
I think they are referring to the minimum store size for selling hard liquor. Only beer and wine except for a few grandfathered liquor stores and places >10,000 sq ft. 
Can you tell me more about what you mean? I'm not totally understanding this comment. 
Scott from the OneNote team here. Yes, I'm real sorry you're having trouble. We've heard a lot about this lately. Trust me, we are doing what we can in the near future to address many of your concerns. \n\nThe one suggestion I have in the meantime: please try switching Win10 to tablet mode, at least while you are inking. Windows now handles input in different ways depending on if you are or are not in Tablet mode. This may help a lot. \n\nPlease let me know your results, even if tablet mode proves to be just as crappy. And please stay tuned because we will have some substantial updates coming to OneNote ASAP.\n\nEdit: grammar and syntax
I didn't want bad luck so I gave this pepe an updoot
WOW where can I find 2x2 caps like this? Didn't know they existed. 
I bought a TADA68 with MOD-M this round but who knows if it will ever arrive...\n\nI bought the board to have a test go of the MOD switches. If it turns out I don't like them when the board arrives, I will send you a PM. 
Me too thanks
YOU OUTTA YOUR MIND?
I hope they DO update so I can grab one of those on eBay
Times New Roman
Nope. Standard iPhone with latest public update of iOS. 
I sometimes watch ridiculously overpriced items to see if/for what price they sold.
Scott from the OneNote team here.  Of course there's no strictly 'correct' way to set up your notebook.  \n\nPersonally (i.e. do not take this as the official Microsoft recommendation) I create notebooks based on who will be working in them.  So at work, we might have one notebook for our design team, another for the engineering team, and one for the entire organization.  \n\nIn my personal life, I have one for just me, another for my band, another for my family members.  And when I was in school, a notebook for each new class.\n\nWithin each of my non-work notebooks, sections are pretty broad categories like "Projects" or "To-do" and the list of pages inside of each gets pretty long.  I also occasionally indent pages to make the organization easier to grok if I'm scanning quickly.  
Update: seems to fix itself and break itself at random. I am guessing it's a server issue and not specifically tied to the recent app  update. 
is that jon tron
What city are you in? I visit REPC in Seattle looking for stuff like this all the time 😊 
Hey flyingwaffles, ScottSn here again.  We released an update last week that adds a new "Full Screen Drawing" functionality. Entering this mode covers the taskbar, gives you quick access to pens, slimmer ribbon, etc.  More updates coming soon!\n\nAlso, please let me know if you are still having issues with Palm Rejection.  At the very least, this new mode should be more akin to Full Screen from the 8.1 app and wont have you constantly hitting the taskbar icons, etc.
Tactile, not clicky?
Scott from the OneNote team here. Sorry, there's not currently a way to do this in the Universal app. But I will consider this a feature request. Thanks for the feedback. \n\nOut of curiosity, do you write in one language in OneNote and have another set for Windows 10? Or is OneNote just randomly selecting an incorrect proofing language?
confirmed
ScottSn from the OneNote team here. I personally think it's great that you're doing this! \n\nI mostly work on our Windows apps, but if you or your new community would ever like to connect with the folks who work predominantly on OneNote for Mac, send me a PM. I would be happy to connect you.
Maybe this is obvious, but are you sure the email you are using its registered as a Microsoft account? You'll want to use the same one you use on your Windows Phone. 
Just pasting my reply to /u/SgtDirtyMike here:\n\n\nI can't comment on what we are specifically working on, but know that we have heard a LOT of feedback from Surface users about the superiority of inking in the full screen mode from the 8.1 version of OneNote.

Hey jhoff80,  I just wanted to add a reply to let you know that we released an update last week for "Full Screen Drawing."  It covers the taskbar, gives you quick access to pens, slimmer ribbon, etc.  Please try it out and feel free to let me know if it is or isn't working for you.
Jealous. Still waiting on my R2 TADA68...
I might have overreacted a bit. Sorry.
tile based movement doesn't prevent mounts in any way. some other part of the engine might, but not tile based movement. IIRC they said the movement speeds of any moving object could currently only be crawling, walking, and running which would make mounts no faster than running.
>Saying you placed 327th/2657 doesn't sound very interesting, but \n\nis still within the top 13%. That's really not too shaby.\n\n
It's weird. The tertiary legends are front print. They are usually printed in the bottom right corner of the top of the keycaps. The 1 and 3 frontprints make no sense to me. The ß is only used in German AFAIK, but is on the wrong key for ISO-DE. The » « and ¢ make it seem like some ISO US international variant.\n\nEDIT: It might be a gen 1 ISO US international model m that has undergone heavy (new case, new keycaps for a bunch of alphas, maybe a new case) contractual maintenance by lexmark and been abused again (missing keycaps and stems, missing back sticker, the PS/2 plug seems to be missing a pin). 
Look at this cheap scrub being able to spend 160M on herbs... I'm way too poor for this. But your guide will probably still be helpfull.
My running gear doesn't really qualify as running gear in any way, apart from me running in it. It consists of a T-Shirt,  Jeans, a jacket, a scarf, fingerless gloves, some kind of headwear that covers the ears, street shoes and my GPS watch(ok, that one is running gear). I don't have any old bibs or medals either, sorry fox. I guess the closest thing to medals are glasses from a local 1k for teens. Basically finisher shirts you can drink from.
Thanks for clarifying.
Possible downsides include\n\n* harder software debouncing\n* High bus overhead that might result in latency issues regarding NKRO\n* relatively high number of interrupt pins required\n* high amount of interrupts that might disturb timing for USB signals\n* EDIT: You might also get NKRO issues due to bouncing.
Yes, it's cold out.
[This is what I meant.](https://imgur.com/Sg5akus) I'd look up a video on PCB layout on Youtube, potentially by EEVBlog and give it a try. Keep in mind that the layout dictates switch positions, diode positions and stab cutouts and the planed case probably dictates PCB size and mounting holes. Keep those limitations in mind early on. After placing all those things where they nescessarily have to be you just try to place the other components where they fit and route your traces around the obstacles. Try to keep functional units close together (R1& SW1; C1, C2 & X1; the USB stuff; the cap array) and avoid crossing traces over (rows cross collumns, that's fine but don't connect the leftmost column to the rightmost pin of your microcontroller if you don't have to. Try to stick to 45° angles and multiples of that.
~~The distances in the top one don't add up, so there's that.~~\n\nEDIT: The to one has slight rounding differences, but the bottom one would be only 18 minutes total if paces and distances are correct.  
Both should do that.
That's true for almost all german inks that are sold as blue, royal blue, blau or königsblau.
Yes, /r/ is for subreddits (topics) and /u/ is for users.
If the game officially reccomends the wiki at any point it probably means the official Runescape Wiki by Jagex. That one doesn't even exist anymore, because it was horribly outdated and incomplete.
I don't see myself as a collector.\n\nI grew up using fountain pens in school and had a collection of 3-ish fountain pens and 1 bottle of ink. Everyone here used fountain pens in school (but mostly just cartridges). At some point I stopped using them.\n\nA little while ago I wanted to use one again. The only thing left over from that collection that I could find was a Z24 converter. So I ordered an Al-Star and the same blue ink I used to use in school.\n\nNow that collection has grown to 4 pens (lost my 616) and 6 inks. I've made some happy little accidents along the way and have a bunch of things I still wanna try. Gold nibs, flex, piston filler, CON-70, ...\n\nThere are also a few things I'd like for astetic reasons like a twilight VP or a Stresemann Pelikan, but none of that is particularly urgent. 
The feeds certainly look a lot like the one on my Plumix.
It seems to be a frankenboard to me. It's Qwerty and ISO, but I dont see a £ or a μ on it. The inner assembly is first gen (vertical keys with stab wires) but the cable and ibm badge don't seem to match.
Probably standard international, but I'm not sure. There are many manufacturers that make standard international converters. I have one from Pelikan that seems good, so far. Maybe somone here can identify the pen and give you a definite answer what converters it takes, though.
Are you fucking kidding me? I was talking about keyboards with stock ISO-DE keycaps from a reseller that used to also carry Ducky aftermarket keycaps in ISO-DE that would fit any ISO keyboard with a standard bottom row and a non-stepped capslock. Even without that a standard bottom row keyboard (no black widdow) is easier to get aftermarket keycaps for. That is especially important if you want some aftermarket keycaps in a layout as rare as ISO-DE.\n\nDo you even reallize what you're talking about? I was offering you a way to get keycaps EASIER and MORE READILY AVAILABLE. I was litterally trying to IMPROVE YOUR MOTHERFUCKING KEYCAP SITUATION and your keyboard quality WITHOUT COMPROMISING on your prefered layout. It seems you didn't even read anything in this thread. If you don't want advice on your purchase decisions don't ask for it.\n\nIf you want my advice, get a Ducky or a QFR(-i) or a Pok3r or a Q100 or a G80 in ISO-DE. You'll get stock keycaps in ISO-DE (with the Q100 even GMK doubleshots), have a higher quality keyboard, less problems with the software and better options on aftermarket keycaps(watch out for the capslock on G80 & Q100, though).
At least it's not weirdly slanted.
Probably G83-18XX-LXXUS.
I stepped into the same trap last time. You can't upgrade after January 31st. If you get the silver package however it'll end right around the summer "buy 2 get 3" offer. 
They clearly say "Cherry" on the housing. They aren't alps switches. 
Shouldn't you roughly know what's realistically achievable with your program? If your six year olds achieved X on average in that timeframe I'd go ahead and declare a slightly lower goal for Roxy.
I'm not sure how well C25K and 90DG match. C25K is intended as a nine week programm. You can repeat weeks or pause it for a little while, but the intentional rest weeks of 90DG seem to be not ideal for C25K, especially combined with stretching those 3 week C25K chunks into 30 days each, wether that's done by adding another rest week, by adding more rest days between C25K runs or by repeating every third week...
It's certainly interesting. Polling the expanders is always an option. I'm not sure if that polling rate calculation is correct, it depends on so many factors:\n\n* I²C Clock (Mode, clock stretching)\n* Amount of expanders (7 for fullsize, 6 for TKL, ...)\n* Amount of overhead for I²C (addressing, ACK, broadcast with time slots vs polling ~~single~~individual slaves, ...)\n 
Is this about how much XP you earn or a lottery?
I only have 2 Pilots, and it does not seem to fit into a VP.
I'm the friend. Tell me ;-)
Caseking ist offizieller Reseller für Ducky. Ich glaube die haben auch Tastaturen in ISO-DE.
That's where I go digital. Pre-whipe picture on my phone.
One slight remark: keep your countries import regulations(taxes and customs fees) and potential fees from the final shipping service in mind. Based on your prices I'd probably have to pay another 20€ for VAT and another 10€ if shipped by fedex.
To add to the things that /u/BaneJammin said the "big retro bauhaus lettering" consists of the Gorton Modified font (AFAIK exclusive to SP) and centered legends.
That would be nice.
You can export each individual activity, if you want. You open the activity you wanna export, click the little gear next to the activity type and choose a file format(GPX/TCX/KML) to export.
The description when setting the flair says something like "show the day or week I completed" so that's how I use it.
They're basically the only pants I have that are neither fancy nor shorts, so they're the most comfy option I have. I'm generally a fan of jeans cause they're sturdy enough for most ocasions, socially accepted for most occasions (if not too old and shabby or dirty) and IMHO quite comfortable.
An ancient key better left dead.
Well, it doesn't know your account age, but when you last changed your security questions, that can be two very different things. The game itself doesn't even know about the security questions, so that's not a date hans takes into concideration. Maybe a Jmod could manually change the account creation date for all accounts where the last change to the security questions was before the official creation date, but I wouldn't hope for this too much, if I where you.
No, it's n+60. This post is about adding his n to your n.
I don't think that font changed. I might be wrong, though.
There are special frames for women, but the only difference is that you can ride them with a long skirt. They don't seem to be as common anymore and probably never where a thing with sporty road bikes.
The case is curved below the spacebar. They're almost certainly rubberdomes.
To put it in your Terms: You don't look at other peoples submarines. You just don't. Imagine someone in the next stall climbing up to look at you in detail while you're doing your business. Reasons to stand back might include splashback or just having to prove to yourself that you can get it that far...
I think he means work and commute combined should stay below 10 hours per day, so you don't just get up, work and go back to bed.
Yes, unused is rare with cars, but some people have like an old convertible that they only drive on sunny sunday afternoons.\n\nThe fascination with collecting stamps without a resale interest seems to be based on an interest in (foreign) cultures and/or historic figures and moments from my point of view. 
It's a TWSBI ECO.
Oh, wait, the british ones are all metal with kinda smooth surfaces, right? That explains it. I was thinking about german manhole covers that are only metal on the edge and concrete in the middle. Smooth wet metal with road slicks sounds indeed like something to avoid.
Just touch and feel.
That's usually abreviared µm, though.
This probably works best in pouring rain...
Isn't that a goose? I might be misinformed what animals are called what name in english, as it's not my native language, but I'm almost certain that's no duck.
People avoid manhole covers? 
This is pure speculation, but maybe they have/had two factories, one mainly for the US/Canada/Mexico and one mainly for european markets.
It might be the seal of the lid from the look of it.
You seem to be missing half the colums(K7-K12,K19-K24, ...) and your rows and columns seem to be not connected to the microcontroller...
The split between collecting for a pristine collection and collecting things to use them applies to almost all kinds of collectible items. The only exception I can think of is stamps.
"We probably won't ban you for it" is not the same as "not against the rules". Just because the police often don't hunt down stolen bikes doesn't make bike theft legal. 
Love it! Keep it up! 
We're talking about programmer notes. I need text, tables, UI sketches, diagrams, little arrows, etc. Notepad wont cut it.\n\nI personally also like Whiteboards for them.
They're decorative.
Number 3 seems better than number 2, though.
Windows notepad does this when you press F5 or something similar.
Also keyboardco.com
Probably not as long as the Java client is still around. After that it might still take a while, because they'd have to touch (and test) everything that involves xp in any way. That is if they feel like doing it at all.
Don't worry too much about it. It just indicates progress for checking the cache.
2017\\. Probably in the second half.   
It is a DIN connector, but not that one and not PS/2 compatible. [This is the right converter](http://m.ebay.ca/itm/NEW-Soarers-Converter-Adapter-for-IBM-Model-F-122-Keyboard-Remapping-Macros-NKR-/271644933588?nav=SEARCH).
It looks like a G83 aka the worse kind of cherry rubber domes.
You can get your cape from hans near lumbridge castle. I'm sure it costs some gp, but I don't know how much it is.
If that means a new FR920XT with MX greens, I'm in.
You press one switch on Expander A and one switch on expander B. Due to both switches bouncing you'll get multiple interrupts from both expanders very close to each other. Depending on your microcontroler and compiler and timing these might cause one of the switches (or up to 16) not to register.
I like to think of it as having a big collection of tools. It allows you to use the right tool for the right job. Some tools are used mor often than others, but when you need one of the rarely used ones, you're glad to have them.
The steel nibbed ones usually come with a cartridge. Mine did.
None. Jagex is. But that rule seems to be mainly in place to prevent people from posting account details and to inform them that most people here are no Jagex employees.
How about this simple reason: "Why the heck would you need a Facebook App for your TV?"
Don't they have the endura cases that are molded like M13 cases but you'd still have to dremel out the clicker hole?
Do you even Tandem, bro?
I'm usually fine with people borrowing my pens, because I know  people here grew up with fountainpens. That said I avoid leaving my VP on my desk and only hand it out with the remark "be carefull with that".
I only have keyboards with a numpad. 2* 100% and 2* 1800 and another 100% ordered. I'm not opposed to trying a 60%/65%/TKL as my potential main home keyboard, though.
The only other two that come to my mind montblanc and kaweco. Does Farber Castell offer ink? There are also some noname standard international cartridges that can sometimes be found in german stores. They usually work, too.

Having no job (or other steady income) is certainly bad for getting a credit. Timely payback of credit debt however positively influences your credit score. So if you're expecting you might\na)keep your job and need a new credit or\nb)lose your job and need more money than you have in savings\nyou might be better of paying off your debt.
In Garmin connect I can create a running training and add sections (warm up, running, walking, pause, cooldown or other) and repeating blocks(even nested), set the sections to last a certain duration (time, distance, pressing the lap button, calories or heart rate) and rearange them. I'm not sure if all of the training features can be used with all watches, though. Garmin connect also has 4 pre made training schedules for 5k (12 weeks, with or without heart rate monitor, with 3 or 4 trainings per week).
I've mainly used Salix in my "special alloy" VP. It seems Ok, so far, but I'm starting to worry about how long I've had it in there every time I get near the end of the CON-40.
If the Olivetti is MX compatible it should have MY or less likely MX black switches. I don't know if this particular model is MX compatible, though.
Yes, but I have jeans and they're warmer than shorts.
Oh. I was thinking 1 short interrupt signal spike per pin change. If reading the values causes the signal to change back that shouldn't be as much of a problem.
Caseking, Amazon.de, ukkeycaps/mechsupply, mechanisk, pexon, lpwl, ...
It depends a little bit on the size. Bigger Saturn/MediaMarkt stores often have some gaming keyboards on display. Smaller ones rarely have keyboards outside their boxes, but you might get lucky if you ask the staff.
I see it more as a minor pitfall when shopping abroad. Sometimes you can still get a great deal or even get something that isn't available in your market.
Yes, but the second one has the same problem. It seems to be the worse offender to me. I think that even if number 3 isn't perfect it's still an improvement over number 2.
It's what plants crave.
You're a bit faster than me. I did half a kilometer less and took half a minute more.
We'll need to know what pen you need a converter for. There are standard international converters, Lamy converters, Pilot converters, Parker converters, ...
It seems to be the only way at the moment, though. Runtastic apparently blocked all non-manual approaches with a captcha.
Hard to find at $100-$125 - and that one on mechmarket might probably be the best price you will be able to find. They are no longer produced, so you will likely have to get it second-hand.\n\nThere is also this: someone is looking to split the alu case and the board. https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/5xqtmm/ustx_h_novatouch_and_silver_aluminum_case_oco_w/
Just so you know, it'll be getting harder and harder since it's been discontinued for a while now and CM distributed their final stock to Originative just recently.
There's one on mechmarket right now. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/5xr2nn/usny_h_couple_of_novatouches_w_paypal/
They're not very cheap anymore. Cheapest I have seen recently is the one on MM right now that is 135 + shipping which is pretty good considering they usually go for around 160 and up
The Plum 87 is an alternative 
Didn't have another. Just taking a while for caps to arrive from VN. Rumor is all small packages from overseas are being checked for fentanyl.
Glad to see you finally got your Night Owl. Still waiting on mine!
I'm pretty new to MKs, who makes these? I cant seem to find them :\\
turtles are made by Suited Up Keycaps and the owls are made by DCcaps.\n\nYou'll find their raffles on Geekhack but they're often announced here as well.
I didn't realize she had another sale! Did she post on GH? 
I just realized how teeny tiny snappers are today when I saw them on a board for the first time! They're awesome. Great collection!
The amount of detail on such a tiny sculpt is very impressive!
Got the Snappers in a recent SUK raffle and the Night Owls were won in a raffle last November and only just arrived this past week.\n\n* Flairmingo Snapper\n* Jack Napier Snapper\n* Donny's Gem Snapper\n* Bayou Green Snapper\n* Gravestone Snapper\n* Valentine Night Owl\t\n* Miami Night Owl
Thank you! :-)
Nice haul! Congrats!
Thanks! Don't lose hope!\n\nAll I need now is for the Snapper /u/xxpaulblartxx/ (or his friend?) shipped me at roughly the same time last November and then all will be right with the world!\n
Man these artisans sure do _rock_\n\nI'll show myself out.
Agreed!
This is the first I heard that one. Very interesting!!!
Agreed! A fresh set of eyes is always a plus with these situations.
Same here man. Every few months a good drop does me good.
Dude, don't turn into me. I had the same feeling when  I was your age, and now I'm 25 and still not talking much in voice com because I'm too worried about the others and what they'll think (and I even realize that it's stupid as shit, but doesn't change...) Chat it up with people, your call out could be game changing, maybe not. Either way information is information.
Man, I always worried about my 89 accord when I had it not long ago. The thing lost so much power and speed going up hills that I had to practically floor it a bit before the hill to gain enough momentum to actually make it up. Always waited for a cop to pull me over and ask why I was doing like 70 in a 45. "Office, my car wont make it up that hill otherwise." It never happened, but it was always a thought lol
Thank you! :-3
I know you said they're not losing power, but can you try swapping one of the bulbs out with the known good one thats in the lamp? See if it happens in the lamp, and if the one from the lamp has the same issue in the other lighting 
I've been trying to figure out what they're about for some time and nothing's made sense with them. Sorry for not understanding something and asking for help in a subreddit.  \n  \nAny suggestions on where best to start in their content? I take it most of its on YouTube.
Jet skis. They could have called them boatercycles
I keep seeing h3h3 stuff scrolling through all, but I can't seem to figure out what exactly it is, and why there's so much hype for them. I know the legal thing is an ordeal so they're popping up for that now...But I don't get the popularity otherwise...Anyone?
Now I'm interested...What albums this from, or what's it from if not from a CD/ep?
Thank you.
I love Andersons cinematography! I know nothing of movies really, but do you know of any other movies, etc that are similar to his style, or of his? I've seen Grand Budapest and LOVED it, same with Moonrise Kingdom, but I'm craving more!
Yea. It sucks when I'm playing on break at work via Bluetooth in my car :-/
Just to confirm, skippable diamond ads from fairies are now fixed? I've been waiting till I knew it was fixed before buying.
I can confirm tap titans 2 does, and never did on 6.X. I think. I don't know the requirements but anything I've tried in landscape doesn't allow for multi windowed mode, anything I've tried in portraits OK.
Yea, it was pretty gnarly. I'm down for the body mods. My tongue is split and I had magnets implanted in my ring fingers. I did research. I looked into these for a few years before I had it done, and a pro did them. 
Oh yea! I loved that series, all of them really :-)
I've had it regularly since Valentine's. I even put a few more points into it since the event.
A bearded lady is a bearded lady to me. They did great too!  \n  \nThank you!!! :3
What you sent is great. Thankfully I had some of those from her suburban drop from waaay back, but a lot of old stuff I didn't have. Thank you! How can I repay you?
I tried to get help recently. My doctor's office has an online message system, so I shot a message over asking for a referral to someone for depression and anxiety, but for this they won't provide a referral without talking about stuff over the phone. To say the least I don't have an appointment for anything yet...
That's gotta be rough :-x I dont use that feature (thankfully after you told me that) I don't even have the notification bar on my home screen, only in certain apps. I hate it hahaha
Are you on 7.X? A lot of multiwindowed support was introduced
It already is like UberEats. I work for them and it's almost the same set up. There's an upcharge for the food, and a delivery fee. The 12$ burger you're buying is probably only 8$ if you called and ordered. UberEats driver gets paid per delivery.
ABRACUMDABRA!
Yea thats how it was for me. :C
Some games do this some don't. Some have in game settings you can change too
Thanks. Purchased :-)
No it doesn't. You'll still need to manually change those, or change it with the macro from this program and then reopen the game, etc. I've been using this for a few months now. (Movies on speakers, games on head set.)
So they're popular because they're cool with a few others that were popular? That's it. They don't make content for anything or do anything else? This is even more confusing...
It's not just an iPhone thing. It's this game. It happens on Android too :-) Sadly Android doesn't have a fix like iPhone.
I read that post in a very "just waking up" fog, but I think he was trying to say the % was 3x more than advertised, not the cost of the item itself. 15% x3 = 45% is what he was going for. Regardless it was a stupid approach and terribly worded.
You shouldn't have to worry about checks bouncing from your employer. That's a red flag to begin with...
They're asking g how to pronounce it, not write it though. How is the @ sign spoken in this example? 
/r/learnprogramming maybe? I think that's the sub.
Flag girl doesn't count
I thought it was a dress from the thumb nail. I was confused for a bit
I'd love to have you in my clan if you're interested. It's casual, but we do care about clan quests. We just hit over 100 clan quests recently. Just PM me if interested

I sure hope so. The less clutter I have the more I like my phone. Sorry that I don't have an answer but I do want to know too!
I've had to stop using max for this reason. Really irks me to not have everything ending in 0

Lol a lot of apps are having issues right now. Glad there's a work around
Thank you! I think it would benefit knowing for sure honestly. It would be one of those "well this makes sense" if it's a yes, and a "well shit I'm just weird as fuck and can't people at all" if it's a no :-P \n  \nI just got out of surgery and will be on bed rest for a couple weeks so I'll check those books out

When I played, I soloed all the way to 60. Not sure if it's changed again...
This looks like a very happy start to a very confusing thriller...
Mine has nothing like that on the back. Just the Samsung logo really. T-Mobile client. New phone from the box.
Yea, I just went to my 8th k.flay show actually :-) I make sure I bring at least one person who has never seen her before or heard of her to the shows. That's my way of giving back to her haha
You taking the time to post here means you probably care more already and do more already than others in your position :-). \n  \nEdit: I can't type when I'm waking up. Made some typos disappear.
What spreadsheet is this?
Pretty much you pick relics OR steps, you don't pick both.  \n- Steps: If you want to know what to level for the next 100 artifact levels you can put 100 steps.  \nOR  \n- Relics: How many relics do you have? We'll show you the "best" steps based on how many relics you currently have.
Yea I've noticed hue and Android aren't as amazing as iOS. I used to make "charts" for music/rhythm games and this would just be a way to do that to a movie or show. I'd be down for it, just need a way to make a 1-3 hour script haha
I think they meant the 3 fingers in the middle of their hand. Pointer, middle and ring finger as I know them. Exclude the thumb and pinky finger.
Giant eagle does this if you're from that area. It's not a delivery, but curbside pick up instead. Saves SOME time still :-)
Thank you!
How many pork chop tats are there ;-)
Jarate?
I've yet to see pretty in pink. I'm going to settle in and check it out in a few! 
I really enjoy my bloom, and I'm thankful I have a small light. I use this stuff strictly for ambient lighting when gaming and watching movies, the bloom adds the perfect amount of color between my two normal hue bulbs to spread a bit of color flair in-between them. 
Could be part of the back story. Maybe they get a few rolls and get the total. Maybe OP can't read numbers. ;-)
I found a few extra buttons laying around in game. If you're on Android 7.0 or above put the game in multiwindowed mode and make the game.a bit smaller, you can see all of the left side buttons (eggs, tournaments) and one or two unfamiliar ones too. Wonder if it's a coming feature.   \n  \nI kinda have a thing for collecting these kinds of cards. If anyone would like to sell theirs to me after they use it in game, MSG me! USA here
I can barely cook while I cook lol. Baby steps
It's the exact same as the sword master world. Just a different hero and artifacts.

I'm going to be alone forever because I'm a fucking terrible wreck. I've been trying to make it seem OK to me, but it's been a struggle lately.
The rings around the two abilities you have mean you've put skill points into a skill that impacts those two abilities.
I've never had issues and I'm running a pretty decent Nova Launcher/KLWP set up

POE is getting a HUGE patch soon called 3.0, adding 5 new acts (The game currently has 5 IIRC, so doubling story content essentially) and adding new skills, etc.  \n  \nCheck out the details here: http://www.pcgamer.com/path-of-exile-the-fall-of-oriath-expansion-adds-five-acts-and-a-whole-lot-of-deicide/

But what does your job actually have you doing? I'd be interested in hearing what a typical day is for you at work. It's a new industry that I don't know all that much about
What better time than "recovering from surgery"? :-)
Legally what was done was wrong. Is it stupid that opening Spotify at a red light  is considered "wrong"? Probably but that's not the question that OP was answering :-)
Theres a bot that makes subreddits that people joke about just in case it ends up being a thing :-)
Nope. Doesn't change anything for me if I pause and play a song after opening TT2. Nothing I've done reverts the sound back to normal while actively playing. It's not the biggest deal, just annoying
Saw this post scrolling through all. A lot of apps and services are having issues. Amazon servers are having issues which is causing issues all over!!!\n
Working right around the corner from this place I knew it was a fail from the day it was announced. Not the right place for this venue.
I'm all for doing what people want with their body. My only issue is people that go an unsafe route to do their modifications. The post you're referencing was one that she seemed to do it herself. Bolt cutters I think? Not okay with that. If she went to a professional and had it amputated, that's a different story.
If I don't have a referral my insurance won't cover it nearly as much as with a referral. Thats with all specialists sadly. :-/
Recheck, the post was removed.
Yea I was hype to see this on Netflix! I've been wanting to see it forever. Gantz was one of my favorite manga and anime to watch years ago!
I'd love to sync a few very specific moments in movies and all, I wish there was an easy way to make entire "sync events" for movies that people could download the file for and when they watch their movie they can load the hue profile to sync. 
I have no idea what this h3h3 thing is or where to start getting "hip" to them, but I see them all over and so many people love them. Anyone ELI5?
Yea! But didn't a new season come out/coming out soon? If it'd already out I haven't seen it yet
The Hue Pro Android app gives you very basic functionality. You can change colors per light by milliseconds but it's not quite there yet. I know 0 about actual coding/programming so I can't make a program for us sadly :-(

So you're the mystery man 😛 thank you so much for the awesome gift! 
Just what is commonly paired with a lot of the controllers and is cheaply implemented. I actually like mini more that micro although it's rated lifespan is shorter I have had far less issues with mini. Were currently in a transitioning period (fairly stagnant) where within the next 2-5 years I expect to see a hard switch to the Type-C interface in majority of peripherals (some already making the move).

It may be dull to some to include the entire swap log so I placed the end product first and you can scroll through if you'd like. I pulled out an old, old DSLR to take pictures and had a bit too much fun.\n\nFilco Majestouch 2 with Browns has DSA Borealis + Novelties & Syrup and Shaved Ice Green Mint Jelly Key.\n\nFilco Majestouch TKL with Blues has custom DSA PBT Blanks keyset with the Constellation Round 1 Series and Trass and Lava Jelly Keys.\n\nIt's been a blast in this community thus far. I especially want to thank u/TheGreatIceDrake and u/Ubernooby for all of their help and patience with my many questions. \n\nCan't believe it's only been two weeks .. I'm in for it, guys.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^^^Send ^^^help.\n\n^^^^Just ^^^^kidding, ^^^^don't. ^^^^I ^^^^love ^^^^it.
Thanks for the reply! They look great with the keyset and color scheme you've got going. :D
I think the black accents look cool! Nice board!
Thank you again for putting this together! Today was awesome! Thank you also to u/raenbo for the awesome Aerophant that I won in the raffle.
I used this on a few of them but they were pretty finnicky so this tactic was difficult. I ended up using small pieces of painter's tape to occupy the empty space like u/El_Dubious_Mung suggested.
Ctrl + R for refresh will change your life. I used to be an F5er too until I learned Ctrl + R. All I use the F-row for is Alt + F4. 
Negative, Ghostrider. What are you hoping for from VCD? Trying to see what the color looks like?
How many tries did it take to hit the trashcan?
Thank you for offering this (: I think it's great that you're assembling different types of paper as an affordable option for people worried to drop larger sums on paper they're unsure will fit their needs. What a fantastic idea! And beautiful work as well. I'd love to have the opportunity to win the black sampler notebook option. Thank you again!
I gave me a good *chuckle*
Thank you! Green is my favorite color so I wanted to get something with green. I vacillated for a few days between white and grey alphas but ended up going with white. I don't regret it!\n\nI'm jealous of your SA Camping set! I hope that it doesn't end up delayed like the other SP sets currently in production. That's a great set! It was before my time, though.\n\nThanks on the Jelly Keys! I went a bit crazy with the ones I wanted and then somewhat matched the boards accordingly. Jellys are my favorite artisans so it's nice to have them match up so well. \n\nThe only row I have trouble with on the Borealis is the second from the bottom; they're a bit difficult to see. I touch type with no problems, though, so the lack of legends doesn't bother me from a functionality standpoint, merely an aesthetic one.
You *are* helping. I completely agree. And I will forever be grateful for your *help*.

Go, my friend, go! All my positivity and enthusiasm is being sent your way today.

Awesome title (:
Bought a switch tester from u/mgsickler 
Makes sense. I'm glad you found a board you dig! I'm still looking around but I *really* love the WF.
DSA is life. 
Bought Jelly Key from u/the1gamerdude
Aw man. If it's any consolation, the teal modifiers look great.
Just realized it was 75%, not 68%. I hardly find myself using the F-row, though, so I don't see myself missing it. I appreciate the minimalism aspect more than the F-row.
Awesome caps, I love all the colorways. My favorite has to be the Bloodwine, though.\n\nThe Beach Babe Snapper reminds me of the opposite colorway of Rammus from League of Legends!
Well that would make sense why you're looking for VCD then. Teal modifiers would be cool.
PMing.
With a ring made of exclusive Jelly Key Nebula keys.
Just so you know, Jelly Key Nebula was never sold. They're just an example in their portfolio of some of the keys they've made.
Bad news. The Majestouch won't be there. The WhiteFox will, though!
Thank you so much for doing this :) I'm still pretty new to the community so when I see people selling things they won in giveaways it makes me really sad. I've yet to win one of the many I've entered this far so it would be awesome to win!\n\nHere is a picture of the artisans I have thus far, minus a Syrup and Shaved Ice Green Mints. :) https://imgur.com/a/wLJxE
Thank you for doing a giveaway and creating these awesome caps!
Boo. They did that when I requested a different modifier color for the DSA PBT Blanks set, too. Sorry man.
Thank you for this! I used your suggestion in combination with u/El_Dubious_Mung's of painter's tape rather than cellophane tape. I'll have pictures up soon! Thank you again!
I hate to post a comment and get you excited but I want to wish you the best of luck! 
Filco Majestouch Ninja TKL with Browns was my first! Filcos are great boards. Enjoy!
Klacken! I haven't seen that one before. That's a great name! Hah. Thank you for doing this!

Whoa. 
This is incredible. Thank you also for the explanation of naked eye vs. long exposure vs. touchup!

I was curious whether or not superglue would harm either the keycap or the stabilizer so I opted for painter's rape instead.

I've never been a mod before so I can't imagine the amount of thankless work they put in on a weekly basis for nothing other than the love of the community. It's awesome they're willing to use some of their time to help keep everything together. (:
Of course, you all deserve it! I hope you're having an awesome Tuesday thus far.

Thank you so much! This was perfect. The painter's tape was a great idea as I was worried about gunking up my keys and/or keyboard. Thanks again! :D Pictures coming soon.

Oh shoot, okay. I'm still extremely new at this.\n\nedit: Just looked again. 75% because of the F-row. Got it.
Glad to see this posted, Drake, and glad to call you a friend. Thank you again for putting all of this together for a community who has chosen to come together over a trying time. I've only been in for a few weeks but seeing things like this is fantastic. Also-- I didn't know we were voted second nicest sub! That makes sense.
The colorway of that Skullthulu is incredible! I just recently realized the scale of artisans and have become infinitely more amazed by the craftsmanship that goes into them. After seeing so many close-up pictures I was under the impression they are large pieces but when it clicked in my head that these keys fit on a 1u keycap my mind was blown. I'd love to have something like this!\n\nThank you for doing this!
Great looking set! I would be interested.
Looks awesome! I haven't seen that set before but that's likely because they're just starting to arrive and I wasn't around at the time of the GB. Excited to see more of these sets!
I had to second guess my knowledge regarding the differences between Type 1 and Type 2. I thought for a moment perhaps they were showing that those who develop diabetes later in life can still get back down to a healthy weight and live active lifestyles. I was incorrect. To r/fatlogic the picture went.
Idk I tried to do a $0 donation and it said it was invalid so I donated $5 hahah. \n\nI'll let u tuch my Majestouch but be gentle.
As long as I don't have to work I'll be there! Just bought my ticket.
Aw man, no board?? Just the Trass and Lava key?\n\nedit: Doh. It's late and I've been working all day. Didn't read the LED part of your sentence. And I even saw pictures of your keyboard in the album. I'll excuse myself now ..\n\nAnyways. You aren't missing too much. The LEDs on my keyboard aren't strong enough to see T&L's full effect.
Bought Jelly Key from u/dracoNiiC 
Thanks for doing this! You're awesome!\n\nI would like to enter the first raffle please. \n\nMy favorite non-Billboard song? I thought about a song from years ago I really enjoyed when I was younger: [Radio](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nwDlqaeZ0) by He is We. \n\nMy favorite users are the two others in my Jelly Trio: u/Ubernooby and u/ThrGreatIceDrake. Both of these guys started by helping me out with my Jelly Key questions and starting my collection. I'm happy to say that I've since become friends with both of them. (:
It's a great board but I don't know that I need the F-row! Did you find that you used it often enough to justify keeping it around?
Thank ya!
AHHH MY FIRST RAFFLE WIN! I'm so excited! Thank you, /u/TheGreatIceDrake and /u/Tally810 and everyone else who was involved with this raffle!

Oh, that's a really nice offer!!  I'm covered on cables though.  I was just trying to think of a use the extras if you can only find bulk.
Well, I don't own all the switches, but I have a [few](https://imgur.com/WfsgJdH) and its somewhere between a Mathias Clicky switch and a Fosen Aquamarine switch. But neither are really perfect. 
My mine is a little bit different than most, as we are the closest major pit operation to a major city in the world, IIRC. That means we have lower than average wages due to demand for the jobs. \n\nWith that said, starting is around $50-$60 with a 7-10% STIP at the end of the year. \n\nWe are also unique, because we have a lot more women working here than an average mine. Probably around 30% for the salaried folks and maybe 20% in the hourly? \n\nEdit: I'm in the US.

/r/mechmarket is a great place to look. 
Unfortunately, /r/mechmarket has posting and title requirements. It would have to fall into [Meta] (must be mod approved and I wouldn't bother them with something like this, nor do I think it would be approved), [IC] interest check, [GB] group buy, or a typical sales thread which doesn't fit either. \n\nBut feel free to check out any of my sale items or trades posted already =) 
Haha, fair point!
Perfect! Ducky 5, 6, or iKBC would all be good options for you. 
Bought an artisan from /u/XS121
Thanks for the suggestion! I've actually had a copper wrapped cable made by them. But they couldn't put the clear heat shrink on the ends, they used black which kind of ruined the asthetic. Unfortunately, I didn't know they weren't going to use clear until the cable showed up. But so far they're the closest one I know if. 
Bought some keycaps from /u/PM_Me_Your_Fugus
Confirmed 
Haha, good lucky man! I was just going to tag you. 
So, what was the best offer? 
Thanks! If it's not, I'll happily remove it. I just figured if people can ask where to buy keysets or keyboards, a cable would be acceptable too. Maybe it's my wording? 
Well shipping is $2.77. But $60 for an unproven $25 key is just too much. $35 plus shipping or maybe $40 shipped is the ceiling. But people will pay what they'll pay. \n\nEdit: it seems like you're trying to run this a bit like an auction.
Replied.
I don't even mind if he bought one for himself and one to sell. My issue is the outrageous price he's asking. He still isn't as bad as the guy who bought 10 GMK Carbon sets, but pretty bad. 
Link?
I agree that the demand is unproven. But that's precisely the point, asking for a 400% markup on an unproven key is just showing how uninformed he is on the market and prices. \n\nBeing uninformed isn't a bad thing. But being uninformed and greedy is.

You're only interested in a volume knob not buttons? 
Voted for the Right spooder! 
https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1485\n\nThe only stock keyboard I could find with yellows. With that said, he could look at one of the modular switch keyboards (Glorious PC Gaming Race or Teamwolf Zhuque) and change the stock switches out for Gateron yellows. But I agree with your assessment, they're smoother than the Razer switch and they're much more consistent. \n\nGateron reds would be the next best in my mind. Equally smooth but with less resistance. \n\n
Any idea which sets you want or a color range? 
Thanks for the link! Yeah, looking at the switch, I think you're right! I'll update the post!

When pexon did mine, they added techflex to the outside to help hold the coil. It looked and felt really great. \n\nWhen were you planning on doing the group buy? Those sound great!

I was just looking, doesn't that say the group buy ended January 5th?
Didn't you just decide you had too many keyboards??? 
I guess the only answer is buy it all and sell what you don't want on /r/mm! 
Link? 
For what it is, this is a very reasonable price. But it only makes sense to buy if someone really wants to own Penumbra but doesn't want to pay $600+ for it. I can't imagine resale would be much more than the $275
Confirmed
Another good idea!

Sorry buddy, it sold last night. But I saw another one today. I'll see if I can find it.

I managed to get two grab bags in the last SP sale. The only thing that really makes me think that it could be from SP is that I received ~10 or so Penumbra alphas in it. So either SP found some from your original sale or they've started producing OCo's sale earlier than their time line stated. Or what OP stated is true and it's a weird small run. \n\nIt's definitely not concrete proof. Hell, it probably won't make anyone think twice, but it's curious to me.

Tooooo many cool things! Thanks I'll watch out for it. 
Well, the flag series is easily worth $100. At most there were 15 of each made, some had less than 5.
It's a linear switch.  I used to own a Pingmaster keyboard which uses Alps SKCC Green switches, this feels very similar to it, but with more resistance.  Not a bad feel at all, if you like linear switches, and I don't.
I really like your formatting.

But this isn't a Cosmo or Kosmo. This is a mass produced Jellykey, not even a limited run. $40 plus shipping is where this should be priced. 
I own Ice Caps and Industrial. As far as I'm concerned, they're both really well made. There might be a tiny bit of warping, but all in all, I can't see it. R1 of Ice Caps did have more noticeable warping than R2 did. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/w8vR9

Which retailer could I buy this from? 
Thanks for the input was looking at filco, as my brother suggested it to me. The only issue i have with filco is the price range. im not really sure about Leopold prices but will check that out.
ah ive tried my brotheers cherry mx switch keyboard. i found it to be to light to press down for my preference. tested some brown switches at electronics found them to be better then mx cherry.
hes has mx red switches. Didn't really like how light there were to press down. from what i did try i liked the mx browns the best.
If you can, get a Leopold or Filco keyboard as those are probably the highest quality mechanical keyboards. They arent gaming keyboards though so that might be a deal breaker. Ducky and CM keyboards are probably the best quality as gaming keyboards.
What switches did your brother's keyboard have? Cherry is the company, and MX are the switches. So when you say that browns are better than Cherry MX, it doesn't make much sense, as they are Cherry MX browns.
I still haven't beaten the Witcher 3. Probably at 30-40 hour mark, i still need to start act 2, but i don't want to, because i want to do all of the quest in Novigrad. But when i went from Witcher 3 too fallout 4 i was just disappointed with fallout 4 felt like the worse game i played this year. Story was good for the first quarter of fallout 4 then i juts lost interest in it. And just wanted to finish it. Since I've finished fallout 4, i had no desire to want to go back and play it. But with the witcher 3 i do want to finish the game.
For me it was flinch and the specialist ability was a major turn off, the reason why i decided to cancel my pre order. the flinch was complete bs i can't say how many times i shot first but still ended up losing the gun fight. the netcode was bs. seemed like the hit detection was bs too. at times i would shoot an enemy and then the dam hit detection was like nope FUCK YOU! and die. I just think the this game would be better if it was not for those dam specialist ability tho. anyone else agree. sorry for the long rant but for the last 3 cods i just feel like this game is no longer able to keep my interest. BTW Tove lo is great listen to her if you haven't already!
it depends on the types of games you like, if you like rpg id recommend  dragon age inqusition fps battlefield on for a good price if you end up  getting xbox live the premium edition is 28 bucks comes with all the dlc. diablo 3 reapers of soul is good if you like mmo, fps wise the best is prob the new cod i like it when i play it, for the most part i play destiny. it all depends on the genre you like racing game forza is the best one out there right now with horizon 2. forza 5 good if you like sim racing horizon for arcade racing like need for speed. sports game wise madden nba or fifa nhl 15 was a huge dispointment  from what i know of one of the reason i never picked it up.\n 
hmm that seems intersting i have a friend with an xbox one so i guess i could just give him my information and have him do the upgrade for me.
i dont know about that cpu look at the amd-fx6300 that's what i have. id go higher with the gpu though like an asus gtx 660 overclok is what i have. amd 7870 or and R7 270 should but u above 60 fps as long as your not on ultra. only thing i havw on high us effects and lighting rest is on medium\n 
i was just thinking of picking up battlefront as in canada games here are like 90 bucks. withe the battlefront discount i would only pay 58$. I've never had a problem with gmg when it comes to buying games though.\n
I was wondering if it would  be best that i work on the mountain or maybe work later time in the day. i would probably like to ski/snowboard 3-4 times a week, so what would you guys recommend. i would probably be ok with doing anything as long as i can find work out there. But im just not quite sure where to look. 
what do you mean by ot?
restart steam that may work. \n
ALL i can say is i only played mcc for a solid month.now i feel like i cant get back into it due to destiny. and halo 5 beta just did not get my interest, all i can say is i think now i come to realize that im not that big into the new halo that is coming out. but i loved borderland 2 and the presequel didnt pick that one up since i figured it would prob go to the xbox. the fact that bl1 isnt in this package is a bummer. but ill prob still pick this one up.
I have a 660 at the moment and im happy with it. i could upgrade my gpu within the next month or two. But i ultimately decided that i may as well wait for nvidia next card. Which hopefully they have an equivalent of a 970. i think the wait will be worth it. 
so then i would have to buy an xbox one by march 31 in order to be able to get the free upgrade cause i was thinking of just waiting maybe another year until i get an xbox one.\n
Hmm i'm surprised that no body even mentioned Tove Lo. Imo i think she's has good songs that might be good for a work out. She's not really well known, but she does make some good music i find. I would say that she is now just getting recognized by the radio with two song in particular at the moment. They are habits and talking body. for me her music is better then some of the big artist like Taylor swift or Selena Gomez, whenever i hear them i just don't seem to care about there music at all and would rather just turn it off. Fact in case you didn't know this, Tove lo co-wrote the song.
wtf there is no option to buy dragon age origin ultimate edition it is -125% and their is no price tag they better fix this. i was waiting all day for this game and now there is not even a buy option because it is a negative number. anyone know if this will be fixed at all.\n\n
yes i lag but if your crashing it could be the communication with the origin to the server. but i stopped playing bf4 had to deal with constant lag so i went back to bf3 and boy is it ever so much smoother and funnier. went back to bf4 after playing bf3 and i could not stay on bf4 for more than 5 min had constant lag and i could not take it anymore. so now i mainly play bf3\n
in my opinions headquarters was the best in black ops 1 but in bo2 hardpoint was like headquarters but u got to respawn quicker. but hardpoint was just as fun i enjoyed it and i would happily play it in advanced warfare. along with tdm dom and maybe some uplink.\n
well thanks for the help guys the information was greatly appreciated. so if u dont plan on buying an xbox one by march 31 than would it be better to just get the disc version than or digitally
It's 24 hours only!

i was looking at the whistler website, it says that they're is some sort of posting coming to winnipeg on sept 12th, not so sure what it means though wither you just show up or if you actually have to do a resume. It says that it is a job fair. In the description they make it seem like it will only be a job until december.\n\n
i got this deal today it should be on the bill just under the uncharted price thing. it should say gow 3 code. there something on the bill that say card pin number which is where the 12 digit code is.
i have the same problem so i decided to go back to bf3 i believe that it is the netcode. it really needs to be reworked in my opinion. bf3 will be my main game until they fixed this shitty ass netcode and dark souls 2
i was wondering if anyone got a key code to pre activate the game on steam. i pre ordered it but it did not give me any key. what i was wondering was if they will send me a email of the key on april 25 to activate the game thanks. a reply would be appreciated thanks\n

Its not called a Hyundai forte. Its called a KIA forte. From what I understand Hyundai owns a part of KIA. But both similar companies buy different styles with their vehicles. The KIA forte is a Hyundai elantra in Hyundai lineup. My family owns both a sonata and elantra from hyundai. IMO I like driving the sonata better, but our sonata is a 2013 hybrid 2.4 litre 200 HP electric/gas motor. Our elantra is 2012 I've driven it a few times but I like our sonata the best. Hyundai is one of the best car company's out there. You get a lot for the money. You can go look at the Hyundai subreddit I'm sure u will get great feedback from both elantras and sonata owners. But my parents say for reliability Honda and Toyota are the best. Hyundai are good to haven't had any issues with the Hyundai's my family has owned.
Yea I hear ya I know 1.8s are harder to get without waiting forever.  Maybe you could corner the market lol
it is there because they made it f2p. and the beta only goes to tomorrow ends at 6 pacific time which is 8 for me so if u want to play it test it out tonight or tomorrow. it is really fun but i took a break from it today even though i wanted to play it.\n
if u are willing to give away that copy it would be greatly appreciated if i could have it 
you got it from steam and you havent gotten any achievements yet. i wonder if its a glitch or not. so far i really like it could never get into nv or 3 but maybe after i beat this one. i will go play those.
Nice! i got that today too. i was lucky enough to get my copy of forza earlier today from amazon shipping. I like it so far but the rain really does add another type of challenge in the game. a few times today while racing in the rain i made the mistake of going to fast to turn. Or my braking was just off and send me off the course.

I almost bought this through MD a few months back. How is it compare to MX black or red? (in term of smoothness). Thanks for sharing.
Awesome.  Mine's due next week and I can't wait.
oh my god its gorgeous...
Hahaha, trust me, if I had more disposable income, that wouldn't be the case. It's so hard to resist... 
Oh nice did they start shipping? How's it feel?
I wish I could say, but I've never used any other linear switches!
Compared to my shine 5, it's alright. Probably going to get this in the future
Cute ;)
from many peoples reviews, not great. they are not especially smooth in any way.\n\nthe super old Hall-Effect boards from the 70's and 80's are renowned for being the smoothest linears you can get (if in good condition) so these are quite dissapointing.
Yep! And it feels great, it's my first time using linear switches and it's just super smooth and light. I don't have any problem with resting my fingers on the keys like I was afraid I might despite the spring weight, either, so I'm glad I went for the 50g. 
damn that's sleek\nHow much did it cost? 
It was $100 + $9 shipping. Most expensive keyboard I've bought so far!

Have any leds in the store? I don't see any and I could use some
There has to be some collateral involved right?.  Not everyone is honest and while I think it's a really cool idea, im not sure how you would work out the trust issue other than them paying the full price of the board then partial refund upon return.  I would like this though
Yea it uses a chargeable battery via micro usb.  The charge lasts about a month at a time and even longer depending on your settings.  There is also a wireless chime that you can buy for about 30 bucks and it will be nice and loud throughout your house. .  Plus your phone will ring with each notification.
So when I started desoldering switches I always thought there was solder left in the holes.  Turns out that the switch has a clip that clips under the plate and I use a screwdriver to pop the switch out.  Changed my life
Exactly how I feel about these types of people... complete scum and while I hope it's not the case but that envelope looks like it could hold important paperwork or checks.  Filth
Slow loud and bangin all in my trunk... trunk full of funk ain't never been a punk... I blow on skunk... I blow on doja military minded I'm a mfing soldier...  \n\n  I've been doing this for at least 12 or so years lol
Seems like you will work something out as the trust issue would be my biggest concern.  Other than that testing boards would definitely be cool.
U get the board on mm? \n Edit: or was it the part of the short gb?
Well I got mine on black Friday from best buy and I see them go up for 100 from time to time.  I just got my grandma one a couple months ago also for 100.  You can mount the doorbell wireless without touching you existing doorbell which is what I did.

Oh, and Torchwood for something that isn't anime.\n\nAnother one, although it hasn't been animated, is Goodnight Punpun. Starts off with a surrealist sense of humor, and then delves into more serious issues as the protagonist grows up.
Man, I need to get my hands on the Hyrule Historia. And the World of Thedas I and II, I love that stuff.
Got mine in 2010 and it's still running. I don't use it as much as I used to, but I still play games on it from time to time.
Not at all. I still haven't finished Tales of Xillia 2 or Tales of Zestiria because a friend and I play our JRPGs together and she can't be over here all of the time playing video games. (We bought Zestiria as soon as it came out... We've been playing it for over a year.) So, shorter length works just fine for me. As long as the story is OK, that's all I'm worried about.
The game audio is so bad that I couldn't even tell that it was out of sync.
Was there much romance? I'm pretty picky about romances in JRPGs, and I really didn't like the way Edge and Reimi's relationship was written, so I'm hoping there's not a repeat of that. Personally, that's my biggest worry. \n\nAlso, were there many references and easter eggs to past Star Ocean games? You don't have to give any specifics, just curious. 
I'll miss you, Liam, but you do what's best for you. Anxiety of any kind is not an easy beast to battle :( \n\nI hope you feel better. You deserve only the best, man.
Definitely SO2's OST, it's my favorite game OST, but I do like all of them...\n\nMy favorite tracks are A Feeling of Oppression, Silent the Universe, Field of Expel, Pyroxene, KA.ME.KA.ZE, Rena's Theme (both versions), Lose One's Illusions... Which may be one of my favorite game tracks of all time... Can You Say Yes With Eyes Open, Integral Body and Imperfect Soul, We Form In Crystals... Honestly, I could keep going.\n\nBut let's see, let me think of some tracks that aren't from SO2. Misted Moon, Fallen Leaves, So Alone Be Sorrow, Dark Flare... When it comes to SO3 I'm partial to the moodier tracks. For SO4... Dreams Frozen in Amber, Ruin and Creation, Purge Thyself, Dark Heart Dark Mind (another one of my very favorites, I love how eerie it sounds).\n\nSO1 is a little harder because I didn't play it as much as the others and can't put the titles to the songs, I'm going to have to look at a playlist to remember, lol. Lessee, my favorites are... Tense Atmosphere, New Human Race, Calm Time, What Should Be... 
> Eh. In a sense, he kinda did. But one of the largest "questions" in the game is if the replicants are humanity and if that even matters.\n\nI'll give you that, but the ultimate problem is, since Gestalt/Original!Nier was the only thing keeping the other Gestalts from relapsing, now all of the Gestalts will relapse/go berserk (which is part of the reason why so many Shades were attacking Replicants, they'd gone coo-coo bananas by this point*), and there will be no way to extract the information for the android overseers to recreate the Replicants after they die. And since Replicants can't reproduce naturally, that means there's no way for either Gestalts or Replicants to go on existing. \n\n~~*As an aside, Gestalts' relapsing is directly tied to their Replicants gaining sentience.~~\n\nEdit: Actually, I got that backwards. It's not that Gestalts relapse when their Replicants gain sentience, it's that all Gestalts will eventually relapse without intervention, and when used to create/recreate their Replicant, will cause their Replicant to contract the Black Scrawl, because the data was corrupted. Gestalts can only avoid relapsing if they're given the Maso extracted from an Original Gestalt (ie. a self-awareness-maintaining Gestalt, of which Gestalt!Nier was the only one).\n\nSo, not only is there no way for humanity to repopulate, but without Gestalt!Nier, all Gestalts will relapse and die, and all Replicants will contract the Black Scrawl and die. The outlook's not too great.
Not finished yet, but i'm enjoying it a lot so far. I really like the characters and Private Actions. (and the PA system is good for what I'm used to. It's not that different from running in and out of towns in SO2, except that you can see how many you have at a time and where they are on the map.) To me, the characters and character interactions are the main draw in a Star Ocean game, so that's enough for me to say I feel positive overall toward it.\n\nThe story seems pretty simplistic so far, but I'm fine with that. As much as I love SO3 (including the story and the twist), if I had to give a complaint about it I would say that the flatness of some of the NPCs (and their voice acting... Farleen... ugh...) robbed the story of some of its depth -- especially the war storyline. All of the characters in SO5 are really clicking with me, NPCs included, so despite the small scale it feels more real. I guess it just depends upon what your priorities are. \n\nThe Specialty system is a bit annoying when it comes to acquiring them, but I enjoy that they're back, and I like this version of the item creation system so far. It's not as simple as SO4's, but you don't have to have a ton of FOL to make things like you did in SO3... \n\nI really enjoy the battle system. I think, overall, I still like SO4's better (my favorite thing about that game was the battle system). But having big battles with a lot of characters is different and fun. I'm still trying to figure out which character is my favorite to control, but I did three or four hours of grinding last night and it didn't feel like any time at all. \n\nI'm actually having a really interesting experience because I'm replaying the original SO2 alongside it. Despite SO2 being my favorite game (not just my favorite Star Ocean), I've always though the plot was pretty simplistic. But going back to it now and thinking about how it's set up, I think it's surprisingly well-crafted... Especially the transition between the first and second halves of the game, and how it changes the scope of things. \n\nAnyway, I'm getting off track. Overall, I think I've had a way better experience with this game than I did with SO4, and that's honestly all that I wanted. There are things that I enjoy about SO4 despite disliking it as a whole, but it was just... such a disappointment. I know the consensus on SO5 isn't super positive (at least, in English-speaking countries, as far as I have seen), but if it turns out there are no more Star Ocean games after this, I'm fine with SO5 being the last one. And if this game does well enough that we eventually get another, then maybe that one will be even better.
In a sense? But not negatively. I thought it was pretty interesting, I only wish that they had done more with it from then on, rather than focus on games that take place earlier in the chronology. But I'm pretty partial to SF tropes that focus on the nature of reality and etc.\n\nBut other than that, it wasn't much of change outside of how it affected the characters in SO3 itself. A lot of people are saying it's equivalent to the "it was all just a dream" trope, but I don't agree. Everything that happened in the past still happened, and it's still relevant to the characters it happened to.\n\nI mean, if I found out today that our universe had the same thing going on that the Eternal Sphere did, it wouldn't mean my past experiences ceased to exist. It might change how I look at them, but those things still happened.
I used to eat it like this on the bus on the way to school in the mornings.
I use Celtic Music in Skyrim, Morrowind Music Integration (requires Dragonborn DLC), Musical Lore, and Immersive Music. Not sure if they'd all be compatible together though because I use them across different saves.
As an addendum to everyone answering with: magic! I want to point out that we know (from the manga) that either Atem within the puzzle, or the puzzle itself (perhaps both?), has the ability to affect the mind of the person trying to solve it. Otogi's (aka Duke Devlin's) father tries to steal the puzzle from Yugi after smashing it, and when he makes the attempt to put it back together, we see him afflicted with an illusion of falling into the labyrinth of the puzzle (which causes him to freak out, etc.). I don't think it would be outside the realm of possibility to say that either Atem himself or the puzzle can mentally "block" the person trying to solve it in other, more benign, ways. \n\nI mean, Yugi was around eight-ish when he found the puzzle. Even though he was the one destined to be its keeper, he probably wasn't up to all the stuff that went on in the series at that age. 
Thanks for the answer! I can't wait to see what's next.
I always forget that demos are a thing. I'll definitely do that if I do end up getting one, thanks!
When you do future drops, do you plan to continue offering the black acrylic, black/clear acrylic and bamboo as options? I'm having a really hard time deciding between the black/clear and the bamboo cases, so knowing what's more likely to show up in the future would really help, thank you!
I was all ready to put down Pokemon forever as something I'm just not into anymore and then Sun/Moon came along, and now... Now I might just have to get myself a 3DS for Christmas. 
Yeah, that's a good way of framing it! And I'm pretty confident that's what the story was trying to get across. It's not like this would be the first time that Star Ocean dealt with wannabe gods as antagonists, either. Luther even shares his JP name with one of God's Ten Wisemen.
Horse Feathers (Thistled Spring), Red House Painters (Revelation Big Sur, Uncle Joe, Strawberry Hill, Golden), Deptford Goth (Life After Defo EP), Le Loup (We Are Gods! We Are Wolves!, Planes Like Vultures, Outside of This Car the End of the World!), Ghost Bees (Tasseomancy EP), and Why? (Broken Crow, Light Leaves, Fall Saddles) are some of my favorite fall jams.
All of these questions are answered in Grimoire Nier, which Liam talked about in earlier videos. It's been fan-translated for the most part, so if you give it a search on Google you can read it.\n\nI definitely recommend looking into it, as it's a really interesting read that goes deep into the unseen backstory. It also includes a collection of short stories that are really cool.
If you keep at it, you'll probably get used to it after a while. But if you really can't, get an Xbox controller and download x-padder or something that can map keystrokes to the controller. \n\nI use my PS3 controller and Better DS3 to play most games. A lot of the time I don't even have to map the keys because the games that I play naively recognize the XBox controller anyway, and I can use my PS3 controller to emulate one.\n\nSome games it won't be possible to use a controller with, though. It really depends on what you play.
Yeah, given there's no safety rails, having a spotter on heavy squats is a very good idea.
Example of one: http://bddatabase.net/us/item/54270/
Dude grabs a squat rack.  Proceeds to stack up two 7-plate stacks of 45lb plates.  \n\nHe then starts doing goblet deadlifts with a 100lb dumbbell standing on that plate stack.  \n\nIn the squat rack.  \n\nWith people waiting to squat.\n
We went through that for a while.  We were graded on a curve.  No fun to hear that you missed out on a higher rating simply because they ran out of Above Average slots since there were no Excellent slots to use.

Typeface as typeface isn't copyrightable and is specifically called out by the US Copyright office as not being copyrightable.  However, the *name* of the typeface can be trademarked.  That doesn't mean it can't be copied - it still can.  It's just that you have to name it something else.\n\nSource: US Copyright Office.\n\nhttps://copyright.gov/comp3/chap900/ch900-visual-art.pdf\n\n> 906.4 Typeface, Typefont, Lettering, Calligraphy, and Typographic Ornamentation\n\n> As a general rule, typeface, typefont, lettering, calligraphy, and typographic\nornamentation are not registrable. 37 C.F.R. § 202.1(a), (e). These elements are mere\nvariations of uncopyrightable letters or words, which in turn are the building blocks of\nexpression. See id. The Office typically refuses claims based on individual alphabetic or\nnumbering characters, sets or fonts of related characters, fanciful lettering and\ncalligraphy, or other forms of typeface. This is true regardless of how novel and creative\nthe shape and form of the typeface characters may be. A typeface character cannot be\nanalogized to a work of art, because the creative aspects of the character (if any) cannot\nbe separated from the utilitarian nature of that character.\n\n\n> Examples:  \n• Felicia Frost creates a font called “Pioneer Living” with\nembellishments that evoke historical “Wanted: Dead or Alive”\nposters. The registration specialist will refuse to register this font\nbecause it is a utilitarian method of writing without any separable\nelements that are copyrightable.  \n• Calliope Cash creates a textile fabric consisting of horizontally\nstriped grass cloth with a pale blue background and characters\npainted in standard, unembellished Chinese calligraphy. The\nregistration specialist will refuse to register this fabric design\nbecause the calligraphy consists of standard Chinese characters, and\nthe mere addition of horizontal stripes or the choice of grass cloth\ndoes not add sufficient creativity to warrant registration.\n\nHere's another one. \n\n\n\nhttp://www.copyright.gov/title37/202/37cfr202-1.html\n> §202.1   Material not subject to copyright.\n\n> The following are examples of works not subject to copyright and applications for registration of such works cannot be entertained:\n(a) Words and short phrases such as names, titles, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering or coloring; mere listing of ingredients or contents;  \n(b) Ideas, plans, methods, systems, or devices, as distinguished from the particular manner in which they are expressed or described in a writing;  \n(c) Blank forms, such as time cards, graph paper, account books, diaries, bank checks, scorecards, address books, report forms, order forms and the like, which are designed for recording information and do not in themselves convey information;  \n(d) Works consisting entirely of information that is common property containing no original authorship, such as, for example: Standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, schedules of sporting events, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources.  \n(e) Typeface as typeface.\n
Not sure about others but... they seem to want to dump kids into remedial or other specialty programs where it's very difficult to escape from.  Speak another language?  Better be careful with admitting that or you'll get the English Learner tag.  There's also a lack of interest in actually helping kids that do have problems.  Autistic?  My wife's friend ended up having to sue the school because they weren't doing anything for her kid.  She ended up moving to Santa Clarita and her kid went from not being able to read much in... 3rd grade (I think) to getting more or less caught up in her first year outside LAUSD.\n\nTeachers are a haphazard mess without a lot of consistency.  My kid saw a couple other kids vandalizing the bathroom and her first reaction is to tell her teacher?  "Don't tattle," is the response.  Sure, we can mark it up to shitty teacher.  The problem is, LAUSD hosts a lot of them.  \n\nWorse, they seem to have an absolute crap implementation of common core to the point where the math in it blows.  Lots of kids are completely baffled by it and parents are struggling to try and make it work.  Santa Clarita?  I talked to a friend, they seem to have gone a better way and are having an easier time with it.\n\nAR points.  What a damn disaster that is.  We watched a kid that loved... LOVED to read.  As soon as AR points were involved?  Her interest in reading started to die and we really had to work on that.  Santa Clarita teachers?  My friend either scored with multiple teachers saying, "your son can read just fine, I'm not going to bother with that," or they just seem to manage to handle things better up there.\n\nAt my youngest kid's school, they're being taught that 11-19 are said as ten-one, ten-two, etc. etc. rather than eleven, twelve.  Some parent decided on this one and the school's going with it.  Great, now we get to try and undo that damage as it's happening and have our kid double-trained to say what the school wants but also understand what the number actually is.\n\nThat's on top of atrocious principals that don't seem to get removed and bring schools down.  Teachers that are essentially worthless but never seem to be eliminated.\n\nSo some of it is school-by-school based with LA having some low income areas that doesn't tend to attract the best teachers, some of it is district policy or district implementations of curriculum, some of it is localized bad apples that seem to spoil the cart, and some of it is a lackadaisical approach to cleaning that cart by the district which seems to trickle down to the individual schools.
[According to this, no, it's not a vegan dog.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/25j9br/weve_all_made_our_mistakes_in_the_past/chhtq1b/)\n\nPerson claims to be the guy in the picture and confirms it's not a vegan dog.\n\n> This picture is of me. I got that tattoo done in NYC at White Rabbit Tattoo (a vegan tattoo shop). To those defending me, I thank you...but that is a REAL Nolan Ryan beef hotdog. I'm not a moral-ethical vegan, I eat vegan because it's the healthiest option for preventing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and so on (they run in my family). Once I started eating vegan I lost ~65lbs and kept it off which I hadn't been able to do before, so I got the tattoo as a reminder to myself NOT as a statement. Still, I have no issue eating animal products from time to time because let's face it...animals are pretty damned tasty, they're just bad for you.  \n  \n> EDIT: By the way, this is a repost http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1cwee1/hipster_irony_hint_read_forearm_tattoo/  \n  \n> EDIT 2: I was a strict vegan for about 2 years before I started to eat any kind of animal products again, so I do know exactly what the definition of the word is I just don't agree with all of you on what that definition is. I do hold myself to certain standards. Not super strict standards, but MY standards. I really don't give a shit what the ethical-militant-religious vegans think. I think I might add 99% in front of my tattoo and a little hotdog on the other side just to get the point across. Or I could just add an -ish at the end. I bet you'd all love that.
My oldest niece is the opposite.  She was rather miserable in high school a lot of the time and completely buried in schoolwork until wee hours of the morning pretty regularly.  She got to college and life has been much better for her.  The high school she went to put most of the kids through hell to such a degree, even college has ended up easier for a lot of them.
There was one Youtube comment that basically said, "if I created a new instrument, Rob would already be able to play it better than me."\n

Haven't migrated to Windows 10 yet.  I'll wait until I build my next computer before going through that.
This is why I wait until it comes out.  Then check the reviews.  Then wait until Steam or Amazon has it for $15 or less unless it's an online game I'll be playing with other people.  Then realize I should have waited until it was $5 as my Steam/game backlog is continuing to grow.
NetApp and SAN in the same sentence makes me nervous unless the sentence is something like, "no, we're not going to use NetApp for SAN, just NAS."\n\nI swear it's a fluke when a NetApp NDU is actually non-disruptive.  Patch everything, update HBA drivers and firmware, increase SCSI timeout in kernel.  \n\nNDU?  Bam, VMs down galore.  Hypervisors lost all connectivity to storage.  Large bare metal servers down as well.  OS doesn't matter.  Windows?  Linux?  Solaris?  AIX?  They've all hit the same problem.\n\nNow?  We simply take servers down when we update our NetApps.  It's not worth the risk.
Not that I'm trying to call you out on this but... what?

GMK Penumbra was an interesting situation.  The OP stated that if he could confirm with GMK that a run was already in the works, he would quietly back down.

Narciso is a classical guitarist.  Some of his performances on Youtube are some pretty slow stuff but he's had a few where he rips into some 3-finger picking.\n\nI'm mostly a shredder/jazz type so guys like Steve Vai on one end and John McGlaughlin or Al DiMeola on the jazz side really pique my interest.

The Rams have been hinting at white/blue since before the Chargers made the official announcement from what I recall.  \n\nThe blue/white isn't too bad though a bit overdone within the league.  Still, having two teams in the same sport with blue/yellow combinations might be something the teams want to avoid.  The flip side is that there's some current royal blue/yellow Rams gear out there to buy in the form of shirts and hats that aren't just throwback jerseys so who knows.

Yeah, it was pretty sad.  We'd go over for a family get together and she's be dragging herself out of bed at 2pm because she was up until about 5 the night before doing homework.  That or studying for the SATs like crazy.  It was pretty insane.\n\nNow she's having a blast, getting to travel for various things through the university and enjoying life a lot more.  I suppose that, possibly, it's worth it but damn it looked like it royally sucked to go through.
Lots of tweets asking for the royal blue / yellow combo to be brought back.  Given those pics, it certainly does like the older blue/white combo though.
As someone that's well under that income level and raising kids in LA, that about sums things up.  I will say that the income needed can be lower for people like me that bought a house in the early 2000s but these days, more money is most certainly needed.\n\nAs for LAUSD, that system is a mess.  Were my wife's tolerance levels for pain higher, she'd probably just home school the kids and figure out other ways to have them socialize.  She's been tempted to move out of state but we want to clear up a few things first so we can sell our house and buy something outright elsewhere simply because LAUSD sucks.  Kind of regretting not moving up into the Santa Clarita area now.  Though the commute would be even more brutal than what I've got into the SFV.  Still, avoiding LAUSD would be golden.
Nope, the towel just goes on top to stay warm on both sides.

Damn, where do I signup for a place that has kayaking trips!?
In this case, she's done fantastic in both.  It's just that the high school she went to was pretty brutal in terms of classwork.  That on top of studying like mad for SATs had her pretty well wiped out a lot of times.

Now you're talking about font software, not fonts since we seem to associate all of this with fonts.  The real breakdown seems to be that a font = software and everything else is typeface.  In that regard, fonts are protected under copyright but the typeface is not.  The software that distributes and installs the fonts can be protected.  The fonts cannot.   Hence why even the font used for checks can be copied and there are open-source versions of it that have been successfully used for banking purposes.\n\nTo put it a different way, if I create a new typeface called FontBob, it's not protected.  If I then create software called BobDesk that installs FontBob on your computer and can scale FontBob to multiple sizes, BobDesk is protected.  FontBob is still not protected and someone else can recreate it and call it FontRobert.  I've watched it done with the MICR font.  There's several packages you can install that will install this font.  Yet there's also GnuMICR that attempts to recreate the MICR font as open source software.\n\nedit: we really need to clarify if we're talking about fonts or typeface as they do appear to be different from a legal perspective where typeface is basically what we all think of as the basic font; ie. the stylized character while a font is actually a software representation of the typeface.

Yahoo Notepad is one of the few online notepads not blocked at work these days.  It's that or creating a private collection in Google+ if I want to jot something down to save once I'm at home.
I do realize the schools get more money by classifying kids into certain areas.  The problem is more that it becomes very difficult to get out of those areas once the kid is tagged.  We've had teachers warn us of the problems of being tagged with some of these things; the schools don't want you to better yourself or get out of situations where you'd have that higher-profit tag.  They want to just push you through the system and get more money in the process.\n\nThe aides vary from school to school but the good ones are coveted highly by teachers.  My wife's been approached by our youngest child's teacher about possibly becoming a teacher's aide as she lost her last one to becoming a new mother and the current temp is barely helpful.\n\nMy wife and I went through school prior to AR points being a thing but, honestly, modern society didn't really bother my oldest with reading at all.  She was excited to read and could burn through books at a very high rate.  What temporarily killed her interest was purely AR.  That she now had to read stuff she didn't want to for mandatory points drove her away from reading.  My friend was in a similar situation but was lucky enough that the schools up there or at least his teachers were lenient enough to not worry about AR points.  We weren't as lucky and ended up struggling to try to find books that met the requirements of the school yet were also something our daughter wanted to read.\n\nTo make matters worse with AR, my wife volunteered for our younger kid's school book sale.  Kids were coming up to her asking how many points a book was.  They needed books between a certain point range.  They didn't care one way or another about the books other than the points.  We can say society kills reading but AR has certainly done its fair share to make sure that even if kids are reading, it isn't for pleasure.
Looks like today's leg day.

I've hit 505 before so this was a mere 5lb bump.  \n\nAs it is, when I hit 495 and showed some friends, their first reply was, "you should have put biscuits on the ends and just hit 500."\n\nBastards.
Good: 460 lb sleeveless squat went up.  Even better considering it dawned on my afterwards that I hadn't thrown on my SBDs.\n\nBad: 480 lb squat did not go up.  I'm a bit bummed but not too much as I was feeling a bit wiped out this week with the little one consistently waking up at about 1-1:30am and me being the one to normally deal with it as my wife was still recovering from a cold.\n\nA 5 plate squat in my 40s will come, dammit.  I'll just have to keep chipping away at it.
You'll fit right in at the gym I go to near work.\n\nBe sure to also drop the weights when doing rows or deadlifts too because, as I was informed by another gym goer, that's part of what our gym fees cover so it's all good.  I wish I was joking.
Depends on how long you're using them per day.  The Qy8 headphones I got cheap off Amazon last about 5 hours of use.  I ended up buying a larger pair of folding bluetooth headphones that run 40 hours without problem on a charge and have a cable you can use without the battery.  That pair has been fantastic.
Every time.  I watch the descent and think wow, he's struggling a bit.  Then, bam!  He shoots up like it's a warmup rep.
*Sokolov.\n\nThat was my first thought as well.  Such a great game.
Lifting weight.  Powerlifting has been great in terms of stress relief for me.\n\nPlaying guitar/bass are also nice if I'm feeling stressed out at home.
Fun stuff.\n\nKinda reminds me of some other fun acoustic stuff I've seen like [Justin King's Phunkified.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHW5nDDC-T8)
It was the heat of the moment....
See, I was attempting to be funny and sarcastic.  I've had people at the gym tell me it's cool to drop the weight and let the plates crack (and they're not bumper plates) because our gym fees cover all that.
Do I need to forcefully slam the weight down or is dropping it sufficient?
The ending to Barracuda by Heart.
Well, I mean they are a bit pricey to buy.
Well, as the username indicates, /u/NoFunHere is no fun.
Kings just need to channel their inner 2012 cup run.
Yep. Also, how much was the 770 when it was still available? 
Actually, my Shine 5 has no rattling issues. Guess they might have fixed it, or I just got lucky with mines.
Yeah that's kinda why I don't really like them because I don't like how the + on the switch is exposed but at the same time I love it. It's like so hard to decide. Probably going to find a transparent keycap set with lettering on top. 
So Ducky's build quality still better than the Blackwidow Chroma v2's I assume?
Thanks, also mind linking me where you got the keycaps?
Not really, just the wrist rest. But I'd probably just buy a glorious wrist rest
These all sound pretty nice. I assume these are all the same or better quality than the Shine 5's default ones?
Lol I never even knew that they weren't available in Canada, good to hear though
Nah I have a 960 right now, just wondering because I'm pretty sure the 770 is "slightly" better than the 960 in terms of performance.
I've seen clear keycaps before on keyboards before. I kinda love it and kinda hate it at the same time lol 
You need the K version in order for the cpu to be overclocked. Also,  it's not a 100% must-have but if I were you and overclocked my CPU, I would probably get liquid cooling.
6700k. Also, when tf did the price drop so hard for the 6700k?
are those doubleshot keycaps?
Are the 770s still in stock?
Well if you want your keyboard to have a black design then stick with the 5. If not, then go with the 6.\n\nAlso, for the keycaps, it's really up to your own preferences. If you like the key to be exposed, then go for the 6. If not, then go with the 5.\n\nBesides that, there's not a really game-changing difference (I think).
I mean I personally prefer the Shine 5 over my old Razer Blackwidow Chroma (returned). But I'm just wondering if the new Blackwidow v2 has any new changes that is worth getting over the Shine 5.
Use the 960 because it's the successor of the 760. 
Well I heard that the plastic on the v2 got a little better. Probably not as good as the Ducky's though.
Do you plan on getting a hard drive or do you already have one? Pretty sure most people who build a gaming pc want more than 120gb
Light blue?
How do you think the transparent ones look compared to the white ones?
thanks!
Idk, I just feel that the white ones stand out compared to the black keycaps
Mindy Loves Josh Season 4 Episode 4
Oh, then if it's just for the OS then you'll be fine. I've had a 128GB ssd for only OS and I still have plenty of space on it 
thanks, had a brain fart lol
Well, the three main flaws people complained about with the Blackwidow v1 was the cheap plastic, LED indicators, and font, in which they have all fixed now. Just a small thought that popped in my mind.
Probably going to get PBT shine keycaps, thanks!
Oh yeah I see what you mean
Nice to know, so you prefer the transparent ones over the white ones I assume
True, I've owned a Blackwidow Chroma v1 before and returned it for a K70 RGB w/ Reds. From my personal experience, the stabilizers on those keyboards are terrible. The Shine 5's stabilizers are probably the best I have ever used. The shift keys, space bar, and enter keys feel and sound so smooth. Probably going to stick with the Shine 5
The k70 rgb does not have onboard memory when it comes to colors effects besides static, only the K95 RGB Platinum does. The K70 RGB is software reliant as the user above said.
Ah, just seems that there's been a lot of hype around the v2 to the point where it's tempting to buy. Looks like I'm sticking with my Shine 5.
Keycaps look nice. What are they? Are they double shot or dyesub?
That looks great. Where did you get them?\n\nE: nevermind. I see now that they came with the board
Is there something like this with the F keys row? If so, how it's called? 
Congratulations.   How do you like the TADA68 so far (curious to know if you've remapped any of the keys and if so, what your experience was like) ?  I just brought one from someone on the mechmarket and should be getting mine soon.   I agree, not a big fan of the plastic case.    Hoping to get an aluminum case for it if I can find one.  
Thanks for letting me know - I'll have to check it out
/u/koduh made a neat list of [65% keyboards here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/4p9usc/buying_tada68_a_prebuilt_and_programmable/)
Actually, I just changed from plastic to metal this weekend. All you have to do is unscrew a few screws.\n\nMetal gives it much more heft, and changes the sound of the clack.
I can clearly see the return key... Misleading! 
Red! The case feels like plastic though :(
I updoot when I see Tada68. What switches do you have, and is that a metal case?
I believe it's a 65%(60% with arrows)
Oh! So the 5% is the arrow keys? Should really keep an eye out for 65% keyboards. I think this layout is perfect for my needs.
I still think I will just be released on PS4, then after some time other platforms will get it too. 
Here's some off the top of my head. Leopold FC660M, VA68M and the magicforce 68. 
is there a UK version of this? \n
Nah, you just have to remove some key caps to reveal the screws that bound the pcb/plate to the case. Remove the screws, remove the pcb/plate (be careful not to damage USB header), place pcb/plate into new case, screw back in, put key caps back on. 
i always in love with tada68
I guess the stock case is always plastic of the Tada68 which isn't bad! Personally I like the sound of plastic cases more than aluminum cases.\n\nThere are aluminum cases for the Tada68 too if you really want a alu case for your keyboard. :)
I gotta ask: would changing cases mean you'd have to do any soldering?
I don't think I bought through group buy. I've gotten my off from taobao via an agent. 
Thanks!
Do you know when the next group buy is for this?
If you've got the time, this would be a great addition to the wiki. Thanks for putting this stuff together.
I only see an Enter key. He's past the point of no return.
Would love to see a current one about 75%'s.
You're probably looking for a 75% keyboard. Check out some options [here](https://www.massdrop.com/vote/Best-75-Mechanical-Keyboard)
You can get the aluminum case on Aliexpress from kbdfans's store. 99USD with free shipping IIRC. Waiting for mine to arrive :) 
Dyesub! 
Saved! Thanks for the recommendations. But what about wireless ones? Are there 65% boards that can run on Bluetooth?
Looks really clean! I like it! What is this layout called? I like the how arrow keys are pushed in.
It's a tad out of date. I should spend some time and update it.
May or may not have been your intention, but this reads exactly like a Trump tweet
The extra 5% consists of the arrow cluster and also the extra column on the right (page up/down, delete, tilde)
Filco Minila Air has a similar layout and is bluetooth
That's what I'm talking about. :) 
"Drive". Nice. 16 Gyms? I would love to hold 4 at the same time. I just can't believe in your vision of how this game should be played. 
Same here, but I'm a Pokemon Trainer.
I actually wouldn't mind having to revive/heal my mons after a PvP battle if the reward was coins :)
You need another account with different team chosen. Use it to lower prestige to drop one pokemon. This is pure cancer though. 
We can now prioritize pokestops over pokemons with PoGo+! 
Isn't a flavour fail? I liked the idea of showing off your skills and strength to be a part of a gym. They could just give more prestige points for winning. With a good choice of Pokémon you could win with half the CP of a defending pokemon. 
Check resent 
How about something like this:\nhttp://68.media.tumblr.com/918d21eab894835d915096ab5270fb1d/tumblr_n8wsdbBd6j1s5ckzwo1_540.png
Thank you. 
> They should get rewarded for that.\n\nFor how long? How much? Why their reward means I'm screwed? Game shouldn't work like that.\n\n> Get more levels, get stronger pokemon place high in the gym you wont get kicked. \n\nI can't, its full.
Yeah you're right. Spyro remake, CTR, Crash Bash with multiplayer - I want them! 
Random. Use Google.

The problem is, I need them to have big cups and have no opportunity to try them on. I went to a local shop to try different pairs and the minimal size that I can say is comfortable for me are Creative HQ-1600. I also tried Sennheiser's HD 201 and those were one of the worst there (by comfort).\nAlso, is there any cup difference between each ATH-M headphone? 
Hello!\nRecently I started my adventure as a CS:GO player and I have some questions about the Matchmaking:\n\na) Why there is no option to play 5vs5, Casual, non-ranked match? 10vs10 practicly looks like deathmatch for me.\n\nb) Why can't I just fill out my profile with "recommended languages", placed my native language first, english second and then while finding a competitive game search among players with the same set of languages? Its an option similar to the Prime Matchmaking process, but lets me find player who I actually could interact with. 
(Sorry for my bed language;)
Nsane trilogy isn't PS4 exclusive. It will come out first only on PS4, but it could later be released on other platforms. 
Read the comment section here:\nhttp://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/12/03/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-first-screens-in-depth-details/\nI truly hope user "MGS4_80GB" is right. 
Could https://thesilphroad.com/research get an update?
You wouldn't be forced to play. It's an option, and a great one to have IMHO.
I made one myself too:\nhttp://inkubatorpl.tumblr.com/post/116628860743/future-sight-dual\nHope you like it.
Can we get other posters you did too? Why it's jpg not png?\nThanks anyway!
Lvl 30, dex at 121/136.
How a phone with so many hardware omissions can be best? I really don't get it. Pixel was a huge disappointment for me. Pricewise and with the lack of so many features. 
Not on release. Later - probably. 
Thanks! But I'm doing exactly the same as this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eecgf5o844M but the parameters wont load. Folder appears on the parameters dialog though. I'm using Openoffice to create an xlsx 97-03 spreadsheet. Will try tomorrow on a one created from Excel.
How are players trying to hold gyms? I can't get into a gym because it's my team's gym. Do I have to move to another place to play?
Not remastered. :P
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, because each time I fight in those gyms prestige after being added stays the same and 11th spot doesn't open :(
Am I a first Pokemon?
I would add that the "BREW" seem to be more spaced out from "JOE'S" than "AVERAGE" is. I'm also not a fan of added triangles on the sides of "⭐ 2017⭐". But overall it blew me away :D
As a collector, this approach just shows the lack of knowledge in the card game. But for your guests - cool thing to have.
Like, you want to place a Pokemon and Misty comes up with "Double coins for water my fellow trainer!" I like it :)
It's 0.43.3 now. 
Thanks. 
Why did you upgrade from opo? Why pixel was even taken into consideration? 
Randomness could be a bit more difficult to implement but I agree that's probably a better solution. 
All gyms are lvl 10 and from my team. Other teams stopped playing because they were in super minority. 
Are there Pokémon of only one gender? Like Mewtwo clearly being a male. 
Why? Why not everywhere, on any platform? 
Upvoted, making history here! 
I'm Mystic surrounded by 3x lvl10 Mystic Gyms for 2 months now.
I hope they will give us 'Crash Party' with remastered CTR and Crash Bash. All internet multiplayer, with bash having team vs team option and mic support. 
Sorry, English isn't my first language. I'm on phone ofc. 
But like you said there was nothing wrong with your OnePlus One. 
I just can't wait for the TCC'S Prof video about this and snapcaster reprint at mythic video. I'm so disappointed in WotC. I'm angry, this sucks. :(
The day of its release it will be only available on PS4. This is how I understood that.
'any color' can't be colorless. 
I got a similar flick as well:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0SW0qfT7Mpxc2FxdFYtQVJVTW8/view\n:)
For better overall gameplay. 
That's something worth testing/taking into consideration.
What about this date?\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Crash-Bandicoot-N-Sane-Trilogy-PlayStation/dp/B01NAGTKX3/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1482922408&sr=8-1&keywords=n+sane+trilogy
Probably Dash charge and Amoled. I'm waiting for OP with IP67. Maybe OP4? If I would consider switching to another phone, water/dust resistance would be the main reason. Also I hate this 'metal unibody premium feel' trend. I want my sandstone. Removable battery could be a thing too. 
That's a clever and worth considering approach too.
Servers are one thing, but unfinished product is what makes me want to throw my phone at wall every 5minutes.
You don't recognize smurfing as a problem? 
I replaced mine with the one from ali for like 22$. Looks identical, no problems after 4 months.
Deal. 
Maybe it was before the prestige gain/loss rebalance?
I bought the one from here: [LINK](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/Black-LCD-touch-screen-digitizer-assembly-For-One-plus-with-tools-Adhesive-Film-Free-shipping/32448785390.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.zAnAiq&detailNewVersion=&categoryId=5904002)\nFrom this shop/seller: [LINK2](https://pl.aliexpress.com/store/701907?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.zAnAiq)\nYou can find my feedback with photos under the auction (Poland [PL] flag, 4 stars.)
Why don't mention that on a box then? It will be released on PS4 first. Will be exclusive for a while and then it will come to other platforms. 
So it took them 3 months to create different color egg. Nice. 
This man is awesome!
Thanks a lot! 
[[Sunken City]], \n[[Merchant Scroll]]. Homelands.\n
What if I create excel file via Excel, add it and then modify it through OpenOffice?\nAnd thanks again. 
Make sure the PSU switch is off.
Same as all events. In order to improve the game you can't hold back on ideas and risky features.
Try to organize your eevees this way. :P
First step to fight this was lowering pokemon's CP to your lvl+2. We just need more moves like this.
You will be able to play it first. 
Why did you assumed only one person is unhappy? The lack of availability to participate in gym fighting part of the game can be a deal breaker for many players you don't hear from. \n\nGame shouldn't be designed in a way where starting players shouldn't choose their favorite team because all of their friends and neighbors are in this team and are already in gyms. 
Yeah, but why allow more than one acc per user?
9.96% 66/662(781)
Or you only receive pokemons with lvl equal or lower then yours. 
You realize I would if I could? You want me to attack my own team's gyms? 
Could you give me some dimensions for the caps? :) 
I'm Mystic surrounded by 3x lvl10 Mystic Gyms for 2 months now. I even for a week were part of them. 
You shouldn't be forced to choose not your favourite team while starting to play just because all gyms are filled with pokemon from that team and you want to battle.
There should be sliders for each ball for CP "from" and "to" of a pokemon that won't let you overlap itself and each starts where the previous ball end. With an option to not use certain ball. That's simple, elegant and accurate. 
No IP67/8 and wireless charging are dealbreakers. From 'nice to have' category: expandable storage, thin bezels, physical buttons and stereo speakers. 
Times can change - doesn't matter. Time boxes should stay where they were. I was amazed how well thought out the locations were.
PS3 needs them too :D Or PC at least.
I've created a file in excel, tried to load it and still no parameters loaded. I can't believe it's because I don't have MSOfficie installed on my computer.
That would encourage vehicle usage 
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, because each time I fight in those gyms prestige after being added stays the same and 11th spot doesn't open :(
Wouldn't it just lower the defenders Cp to your lvl, not your chosen Pokémon? 
I wanted to know how big the cups are compared to other ones like creative hq-1600. 
Oh God YES. Especially boxes! 
So fighting in a Gym got bit different. Now your pokemon "remember" how many times you clicked it so if you want to attack once and you spam it with hits it will attack at least twice. Before update you just had to stop clicking it at certain point to hit once. Now it works differently. Don't know if better though. 
thx!
You are ruining this game for other players. Smurf account, gave it to a cheating friend. IMHO you both deserve VAC. 
Same here, what i'm lookinmg for now is IP67 and wireless charging. Key features for me to consider upgrading.
Being able to play on equal rules is selfish? The whole idea of getting coins each day for being lucky enough to not get your pokemon beaten is stupid. It should be one time thing. You get into gym, you get a coin. Once per day per gym. Done, problem solved. 
I love those! I really wish this game turn out to be a huge success!  
You have 0.49 or 0.51?
And apparently can't become one. 
Waiting for more info.
Did you just buy a £13 PSU and attach it to the rest of your expensive components? Aren't you afraid of the possibility it could ruin something?
2. Dust filter is needed for intake fans. NZXT s340 already comes with a dust filter on the front where you can put two fans.
Thanks, much appreciated!
Don't mind him. Please add the parts on pcpartpicker (see sidebar) so that we can see if we can find something.
Are you sure that there is no extra standoff that is touching under the motherboard? How many holes does the motherboard have and how many standoffs were in the case?
Wait, I thought most (if not all) prebuilt came already with a wifi card or adapter?
Are there any mechanical keyboards where you can change the switches without soldering? thanks
My suggestions is to wait a bit more. There currently seem to be some problems with hue+ but apparently nzxt is working to fix them.
I'll make do for the time being. I intend to add in the future a hard drive or a 500GB SSD but right now I can't afford it.
Did you plug the VGA in your GPU (and not motherboard)?
I'm not the best person to check if this is a good build, but I can tell you that the price of that motherboard is scaring me. Also, pcpartpicker says that it will not be compatible with the CPU you chose.
Same price :(
On their website, Gigabyte says you need at least 300w.
But what about the quality of the materials and how it was built? For example [here](http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html) it's explained what to look for.
Since it's temporary, USB seems a sound choice.
Does anyone think that there will be a very cheap Ryzen cpu that will compete with the new g4560?
One time an Avira popup that wanted me to pay for premium was saying "Prepare for a total infestation of evil".
Thank you. It looks like the seller has accepted to refund me now.
Thanks! At first I wanted a 500gb SSD but it's too much expensive and I think I can survive with half the storage space I'm accustomed to for the time being.
Is there a plastic film on the intel stock cooler that covers the thermal paste?
Could you add the build to pcpartpicker? It's a little bit difficult to read on the image.
You can try the GPU only if you can plug the monitor directly into the GPU (through the dvi-d wire that you said you do not have). If you don't have that wire, then you have to remove the GPU and plug the monitor in the motherboard.
Wait, so you've connected the VGA to the motherboard (because you don't have a proper wire to connect the monitor to the GPU), while the GPU is powered too? I think you should take the GPU out and try plugging the VGA in the motherboard until you get the right wire.
Thank you! I was a little worried since a guide in this subreddit said that a 500W PSU was recommended for GTX 1050ti, but I think I'll choose the 450 semimodular since it's slightly better.
Wtf chill mate. Can't read well that image 'cause I'm on a tiny screen so I have no idea how bad it is.\nBut OP said is in Australia, so prices will be expensive, and probably the parts that were selected were the ones in stock at the local shop. 
For the same price I could get RAM 2x4gb DDR4 2133MHz CL14 or RAM 2x4gb DDR4 2400MHz CL15. Which is better?
Get the Pentium g4560, it's the best low budget CPU and is like an i3. You can pair it with the cheapest B250 motherboard you can find (you won't need to update it). If you go this way, know that you can get RAM up to 2400mhz and not 2133 (if it does not cost consistently more).\n\nYou do not need a CPU cooler since you won't overclock and the CPU comes with one.\n\nRegarding the GPU, the tier is 750ti<rx 460<gtx 1050<gtx 1050ti<rx 470<rx 480 where the most left is the worse. See if you can get a better one than the 750ti.\n\nAlso, you need to add a power supply if you don't already have one!!
no idea but the nzxt wesbite should say it.
Yes, on the 13th it's going to be 60 days since I placed my order. The seller has now extended the protection for 50 more days, I wonder if I'll have to wait these additional 50 days to be granted the refund.\n\nAnyway, thank you all, I'll keep the dispute open.
If you end up getting a H110 mobo, it will need to be updated with another CPU (a Skylake CPU). If you don't own it, you will need someone that has it that can update it for you.
Could you tell us which model of Crucial SSD did you have?
That orange peel looks oddly like a nipple
I intend to buy a kaby lake cpu (g4560), a b250 motherboard and RAM 2400MHz.\n\nWhat I want to know is: will the RAM be capped at 2133? Do I need to do something particular to make it run at 2400 or will it work at 2400 from the start?
Depends on where you live. I'm in Italy and at that price the best I can afford is a gtx 1050.\nCheck the prices of these:\n750ti<rx 460<gtx 1050<gtx 1050ti<rx 470<rx 480\n
So, does that mean that the ones I linked could be able to do that since they're described as Hybrid or PWM/DC fan headers?
Wait, are you gonna have a GPU? 'Cause then you should only care if the GPU has displayport
Congrats, you are amazing!! Good job, this also gives me hope for my future first build.
Why don't you recommend pc mate mobos? I'm looking to buy a b150 pc mate maybe, is it bad?
Can someone look at the photos of the [PSU Corsair CX450M](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FQ648d/corsair-power-supply-cp9020101na) on pcpartpicker and tell me if they recognise a flat SATA cable between the included ones? 'Cause I can't use an angular one with my case and I'd like to know beforehand if I need to buy a flat one. Thanks!
srsly
I see! Thank you, this photo is very useful, I think these will do!
I'd like to get a b250 mobo, but I'm looking for one that will let me control the speed of 3-pin case fans.\n\nCan someone confirm if I understood right, that the the following product pages are saying that it is possible?\n\n1: [Asus](http://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/PRIME-B250M-K/) with 4 & 3-pin PWM/DC case fan support (check the Fan Xpert paragraph).\n\n2: [MSI](https://us.msi.com/Motherboard/B250-PC-MATE.html) with fan headers with DC/PWM mode (check the Learn more about cooling paragraph).\n\n3: [Gigabyte](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=6119#kf) with Hybrid fan headers (check the Smart Fan 5 paragraph).
A touchpad like those used in laptops.  It's easy to use any finger with it. Sometimes I use my middle finger instead of the index for the left click and I don't even notice it.
This is what I'd like to build (no decision is final). I have questions regarding PSU and UPS.

No problem! Unfortunately prices in Europe are really sad :(
I live in Italy, there's no way it's gonna cost the same with shipping prices.
I'm not sure what your trying to say here, I was merely pointing out that no-one seemed to care back then. But since the popularity of this sub-reddit has risen so much, the same thing has been noticed this time around. I'm not at all miffed you posted it, in fact i'm glad you did. Oh and keep up the good work, I've been following your stuff since you were on geekhack :) 
But auto-looping though
I don't comment on reddit often, but that title is god-damn brilliant. Nice one ;)
I am by no means a brilliant writer, I might not convey everything I wanted to say in the post. I tried my best. I am trying to say that I believe the overall system for 'punishing' users is flawed, not identifying anything specific within the system. \n\nIndeed I agree that riots implementation, is trying to reduce toxic behavior because it is a problem with no obvious solution. However I still stand by my point, that the solution is flawed - why implement a flawed solution?
How do you open htop in a compact view like that? Or have you just resized the window :o
That's really nice :) I'm trying to setup something similar using bspwm, but I can't get transparency to look nice for urxvt. I'm not sure if it's my background or if i'm just setting it up wrong... Could you post your dotfiles?
Well you can argue that voice communication is also more personal, acting as a larger barrier between each player - a comment tends to mean more if you say it verbally, therefore a lot more people tend to keep their mouth shut.\n\nI've played many team fortress 2 matches, some of them going on in excess of an hour. This doesn't happen often, but I've never experienced more toxicity in the game because of the length of the game. So that is open to debate.\n\nHowever your argument about one person having the potential to negatively impact a game for 4 other people, is definitely something that drives toxicity in the community. Perhaps a voting system to disable a persons LP gain for both the current game and following game, could be put in place in soloQ (duoQ would have to be disabled), obviously this is another flawed system but it is an immediate incentive for someone to focus. As the ultimate goal of most players is to increase their LP. Instead of banning the player, it's more of a nudge saying "Stop what your doing, focus on the game and not other players if you want to still gain LP". \n\nThis way players aren't disabled of all ability to play, and are free to enjoy the game...\n\nedit: Riot could implement some sort of confirmation system, after voting has taken place to make sure the system isn't abused...
But are they custom commissioned springs? Or are they just bought in bulk from a hardware store and labelled 'Korean springs', because if that's the case they might even be made somewhere else lol
I am a definitely a better player now (in riot's perspective), and as mentioned I apologize for mistakes in chat and in game. I haven't been chat restricted on my smurf that I play on, nor any other punishment. But it's intrinsic to the game for people to get frustrated, everyone wants to win. Everyone wants to gain elo. That's why the system seems quite over the top, at least in my eyes.
I just played a tahm kench game, after a certain point in the game I was unable to devour my allied master yi. Dying for both me and him and respawning would not fix this bug. Could have saved him multiple times if it wasn't bugged. Perhaps it is related to the fact he had devourer, not sated yet and it tries to target the wolf?\n\nGame here:\nthe 2 / 4 / 5 games with tahm, with a master yi on my team.\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=FerretBuster\n\nI don't have any evidence, I might to try to recreate later but thought i'd post this for now.

Cool thanks, does compton adversely affect battery life in any way (I noticed you're on a laptop)?
GB gaming monitor, it removes red from a standard RGB monitor for a tactical advantage™ over other gamers. 
That's not a core part of gameplay, it's something you can work around when playing. But the hitbox issue is prevalent all the time. Indeed other bugs should be patched, but what i'm saying is all effort should be put into fixing the hitboxes and this should be deployed as a hotfix ASAP. The other items can be fixed afterwards, in the mid-February patch.
You salty sausage, I am an expert final fantasy player and have completed every raid  including ASS.
If you read that entire post that quickly i'm impressed. Judging by your comment, I imagine you haven't. If you have, then your entitled to that opinion, fine. Appreciate the comment.
Well first i'm going to have to stretch, and believe your post. Over 4 years you've never had any issue with debating with another player, and getting frustrated in chat. Never writing some form of negativity, on how the game is lost... I find that hard to believe. \n\nBut let's say your a 100% straight player, a model player. Then good for you. \n\nAs for riot's no-tolerance policies, well indeed my post highlights my dislike towards this. I have been playing on smurf account recently, and had no problem with my behavior, focusing on my attitude as much as possible. But I just know there's going to be a point where I say something riot deems "Negative", it'll just be a bad day. But when you play a lot of ranked it's bound to happen at some point. \n\nIt's this moment i'm considering, and how harsh riot's punishment is. This is why I dislike their system. Maybe I will stop playing at some point because of this, but I imagine if it comes to that point, I will be doing so with a lot of other players.
Aye it's virgin 
Base totem: http://bddatabase.net/us/item/54201/ gives your boat 2% speed boost. \n\nWhen you gain xp (level it) you get extra move speed added to the boost: http://bddatabase.net/us/item/54221/ This is the max level 18% you can get it to.\n\nThen in addition you can enhance it with black stones to achieve extra benefits: http://bddatabase.net/us/item/54224/ This gives extra weight limit, turn, acceleration.\n\nNOTE: This is my current understanding, the levelling and enhancement process might work slightly differently. We won't know until someone reaches high enough xp to perform the growth of the totem.
Well with the current automated system being applied to chat-restrictions, ranked-bans and temp-bans. I don't see why that system couldn't be used in tandem with my idea. Your right about the human thing, that would require way too many people to be viable.
Yea my bad thanks!
Do you have a source confirming that they had anti-cheat running? I can't seem to find one, would be great to put one in the thread.
I think I get the point about making the video. Also you have to press R, immediately after pressing T.

All sounds a bit dodgy 2 me lol
This is the same comment I left to another guy. Same applies really.\n\n> If you think that's the point of his video, then I think many would agree you are sorely mistaken. Riot has brainwashed the community into thinking there is a need to purge everyone that is 'toxic'. This word didn't even exist as a thing used in video games, not before riot introduced the term.\nRiot's punishments are too harsh, and if you ACTUALLY believe that their policies are what should be implemented in a video game, after actually going through and facing those punishments, the only thing clear to me is that this company has successfully brainwashed their players into doing exactly what they want.\nThat's not what a video game should be at all, it should be about freedom to do what you want. After all, video games are a form of entertainment.
> I love when people like you act as if the only thing that is fun about anything in life is attacking others.\n\n*I'm glad you have me figured out as a person from that comment alone. You got me boss.* (FYI this is sarcasm)\n\nOn a serious note, I'm not going to condone what dunkey said as a good thing. Too be honest, using what he said as the leading example to back up his argument was a mistake.\n\nFrom this, the point I made still stands. There shouldn't need to be a system like this in place, the very notion of 'toxicity' and how it is thrown around so much in the context of a video game is ludicrous.\n\nYou kind of just need to step back and look at this as a bigger picture. It's just a game... Not a bootcamp where people need to be reformed for their behavior.\n\nedit: Highlighted sarcasm, cuz downvotes...
I panic every time I see black beans too.

Well that's subjective, but a lot of people really liked it in MGSV. I feel like you haven't played that game, if you did maybe you would appreciate it. I see where you are coming from though.
RIP rito. Maybe this will make you think twice about your genius plans to purge the community of 'toxicity'. I've tried to voice my opinion on this before, but I get too many down votes because of all the sheep that will follow Riot's policies into their graves. \n\nI'm fucking glad he made this video. Maybe it'll open some peoples eyes.
Getting this all the time, it's such a core part of gameplay it's so lame that the problem is still there after 4 months since the full release. If I were developing the game it'd be the core focus for fixes, before fixing other smaller bugs and adding new content. Still one of my favourite FPS games, but these bugs really bite you in the ass too often.
Hagrid is my favourite character in the Harry Potter series, gotta love that voice.
The anti cheat engine uses more CPU? Seems fine to me, if it does it's job it doesn't bother me. It's not like Black Desert is badly optimised, in fact it's quite the opposite :P\n
Thanks! 
Why should I have someone watching over my shoulder in a video game, why do I need to conform to every rule and regulation about communication? Every other video game I play doesn't have this sort of system, perhaps that is because most games intrinsically have less of a problem with toxicity.\n\nAlso you refer to people typing as 'actions'. Honestly unless someone is being intentionally racist, homophobic or similar, peoples actions are just a few lines of text. Lines of text are pretty meaningless on the internet.   
Not the first time people have been baited and outsmarted by Ubisoft :P
I agree with you totally, in fact a lot of the 'hackusations' I have seen look possible by a regular player to me. If someone is a good player at other FPS games, it's only natural for that to translate into Overwatch. This is especially true, because Overwatch is so well refined, the core input mechanics for the game work so well that becoming a fantastic player at a particular hero is possible within a couple of days. That said, there are instances where people who are cheating seem particularly obvious. I unfortunately cannot provide video evidence of the instance I mentioned, which is frustrating because I would love that player to be punished for their actions - however there is still an element of uncertainty due to netcode and other factors. Within that games they provided similar odd behaviours to this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgKOO4K9F2E\n\nThe clip above is almost a clear cut view of aim-botting, but again it could be some anomaly (can we trust the spectator netcode in this game? It could have been that in-game predictions resulted in a spectator bug). \n\nBut yes I can see exactly where you are coming from. The only reason I provide this anecdotal evidence is purely because I spent an entire match saying "what, is that even possible?". I tried to dismiss it as a lucky play of a skilled player, but throughout the match my attitude began to change. Then with other players in the game feeling the need to communicate over the voice chat and say the same thing it became clear something fishy was going on.\n\nTLDR; To be clear, there ARE hackers/aimbots in this game. Not at the number people are claiming however. If you see a potential suspect, the only real way to confirm is identify the moments their aimbot malfunctions in a way that is completely withdrawn from the behaviour of a typical player, or indeed performs a completely inhuman feat.
I'm trying to inform the public (the siege community) to not be a bitch, or to not give up on games and lower morale... I don't see why it can't be a PSA :/
Last time I checked, punishment is an attempt to reduce someones freedom to teach them a lesson. For example Prison or grounding a child. \n\nPerhaps DOTA (as another MOBA) has similar 'issues' of toxicity - I don't play it but I would assume it has similar 'problems'. From experience, in TF2 I barely experience any 'toxicity' if at all. So without facts and figures your points hold no bearing.\n\nAlso 'toxic' as a descriptor may have been knocked around a couple of times (evidence?), but no video game has really used it like riot has. I wonder why...
I understand. The reason I made a video for it, was mainly to say "here's something useful" for the people that were upset with my previous video. I'm thinking of making more in-depth guides soon. I think you're correct about text guides, as they are so much easier to reference for the stuff you need. So I'll probably make a text alternative for any future content I make.\n\nCheers for the feedback.
There is no jump scare...

I got my copy from CJ's cd keys for like £28, ended up playing alone for a while. But it's real easy to make friends online, plus I eventually convinced my irl friends to get it. \n\nIt's way more fun with a 5 stack of irl mates, but it's still a great game solo, since there is a massive carry potential by a singular player.
Fair enough. I'm not trying to discredit anyone here,  just trying to figure out alternatives. How would I go about contacting spirit? 
Against good teams who instantly take out cams, it's especially important to sometimes peak outside, even if only to obtain a vision advantage. Nothing is wrong with what you're doing, players that think your wrong are just being ignorant. If they didn't watch the doors and windows they are exposed to, it's them at fault, you're just taking advantage of their careless gameplay.
https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=23997\nDammit no one seemed to care when I pointed it out. Ahh internet.\n:(
I don't think it has anything to do with the plane specifically, I do however believe it's easier to abuse on certain maps. The reason it occurs (I think) is due to the occasional rubber banding that happens. Some places you can go through with your drones and rubber band almost 100% of the time, if you aim your drone in a correct spot you can sometimes get under the map. \n\nAn example of a spot that almost always rubber bands is the hatch that is located outside on bank, near sewer access, if you jump with your drones just before entering or while entering it almost always rubber bands.\n
Frankly you don't need to keep your shipyards, I sell mine once i've made my boat, then I can invest in other nodes. I then buy a shipyard I need back to construct a boat when my boat's lifespan is low.
To me, there mere notion that riots rules for toxicity have to be discussed on a regular basis is absolutely ridiculous. This is a goddamn video game, not a boot camp for reform. \n\nToo be honest I imagine a lot of people are going to shy away from league if riot continues like this, the very nature of their game provides the fuel to create this toxic community riot are trying to 'fix'. \n\nPeople are going to get bored of being judged in a fucking video game for their actions. EVERY other game that is popular right now doesn't punish players in an extreme manner like riot does, and there's nothing stopping people from moving. \n\nWhen the next popular competitive game comes along, I find it hard to believe people are going to want to stick around in riot's broken community of fake smiles and sugar coated compliments. I don't want a game like this. Riot's rulings are beyond a joke.\n\nAgain, this is a goddamn video game. Why on earth is riot trying to control the game with such an iron fist?
Well not dodgy. I guess that's a bad way to describe what I mean. It's just I've spent all day looking at various spring manufacturers (both custom and stock)  around the globe and I find it mind boggling that the prices the springs are being sold at could mean they are 'custom' made by these people in Korea. I mean maybe they are just super cheap to make in Korea for some reason? Maybe I just need to dig around a bit more and find a good foreign spring manufacturer. But I have yet to find anything viable, even in quite large quantities. 
>In order for this to function correctly, and not be abused riot would have to implement some sort of conformation system to verify whether the call for disabling LP gain was legitimate. They would maybe have to implement a human support system that handles these cases on the fly (as they are received they must be dealt with before the end of the game).
Most fish vendors sell them 800k each. Careful which one you buy though, you need to be able to catch A LOT of the fish you choose. So choose wisely!
Well if that's the case I wonder if someone else knows more? I mean it'd be great to have high quality springs more readily available. Especially in Europe. Is there anyone who I could contact to shed more light on this? 
It gets worse. If a genji sits to the side of bastion (close quarters) and reflects (at 90 degrees, or in an example - bastion is facing north, genji is standing to the side of bastion, facing on the east side of him) the reflect will work and bastion will die even though he's not shooting at him.

After all, video games are a form of entertainment.
I think you'd be surprised at how little toxicity you have to show to get banned. I'm not saying that under riot's system I didn't deserve it, but definitely my ban was for much less of a cause than you would expect. \n\nFrom my ban a lot of information could be gathered if the tribunal offered a replay system, to properly analyse what happened in the couple of games I was 'toxic'. \n\nA true show of whether if a player is actually being negative, or negatively responding to a exceptional situation - caused by some form of negative action in game by other players, could be shown by such a system. Unfortunately we don't have a replay system available.\n\nAnother reason I believe the current system is flawed.
Just looked into it after reading your comment, I thought bots weren't really prevalent in the game. Seems that there are many publicly available bots, but it's not surprising I guess, it's not very hard for bots to hide under all the automation options black desert provides.
That's really silly, he's not even on the pbe yet. Riot chop and change ideas with champion updates all the time, discussing something as small as that seems moot until he's actually in his final stages on pbe. Just my two cents - I main gp myself :)
From the totem option in the inventory menu it says:\n\n- "Catching a fish that matches the Totem's name will give you EXP" (from testing that is 0.5% xp per fish caught of the required type)\n- "Once it reaches 80% EXP, you can upgrade it with blackstones"\n- "If an upgrade fails, the EXP or level might decrease"\n\nOh and note you need professional 1 fishing or higher to attempt the upgrade (totem tooltip)
Lmao the down votes. Follow rito into your graves if you want. I'm fucking done haha. The community is brainwashed beyond belief, great job with that riot. Game uninstalled. Gone. \n
AFAIK (I've since quit black desert, but this is from what I remember). Blackstones are the only way to level the totem. Increasing the exp reduces the chance of failing to level up or de-levelling. When it levels it's completely rng, if you succeed it can either change rarity, change stats or both stats and rarity. Of course it can just fail. I successfully increased the rarity of mine to green at about 80%xp IIRC. Hope this helps! 
What I saw was pure snap aiming, repeatedly (a widowmaker). Unfortunately I didn't have recording software running so I missed out on a opportunity to catch them in the act. I then later got rematched against the same player, with my recording software running. But funnily enough I never got killed by them to see the killcam... (I probably shouldn't have complained at them they were hacking before). But in that same match I had a teammate complain about the same person aim-hacking over comms, I'd never actually heard a single person use voice chat in-game until that point too haha.\n\nIt certainly exists, it was VERY obvious. A lot of people on reddit are spouting hackusations, but trust me if anyone is actually hacking, you will know 100% (given an entire game or two to analyse their gameplay).
That's not what i'm trying to say in my post. What i'm trying to say is that the punishments are quite harsh in respect to what is actually happening in the grand scheme of things. Yes people can say offensive things, or have a negative attitude. But at the end of the day it's freedom of speech, welcome to the internet.

Yeah, i'd have to agree with this too.
Yeah, the low profile layout looks similar
If we're talking strictly 60%. KBParadise V60&Anne Pro comes to my mind.

I actually prefer the stock Novatouch compared to other topre boards such as the FC660C and HHKB. 
That's a great looking home and setup :)
I was gonna recommend that as well but you wanted software. The stock keycaps are better on the ducky compared to CM if you don't plan on changing them out anytime soon. I'd go with the ducky TBH :)
Thank's for the swift reply! I think it's time to get on the 144hz monitor train
Now all we need is a Korean Kustom with stock magicforce caps. Someone make it happen.

Classiest board on the market. Leopold is life. 
tldr: i thought danknissan would never reach 200wpm+. I said I'd eat a keycap if he does.

Take a look at IKBC F87, Asus ROG Claymore and Ducky one TKL RGB. 
Say you have an Nvidia card, will you still be able to get 144hz without using a display port cable? Also does anyone know if this includes a Display port cable?
Diggin that layout; I'm in.
Oh, I didn't even notice the ISO key. In that case, take a look at the CM Masterkeys Pro L. They should have a ISO enter key variant. 
This is what hard work and consistency looks like. Great job man!
hnnnnng.
All jokes aside, that's a marvelous board and one hell of a starter board too! It only gets deeper from here on out my friend :)
My wallet is ready. The Realforce RGB and the FC980C shouldn't even be compared. The FC980C is in a league of it's own.
Every time I see this name, I can't but imagine a person planking. 
Thinking smart with that investment :)\nIt has! But I haven't gotten around to doing it so, but I'll definitely have a video up next week for sure haha

Leopold FC750R. You won't be disappointed.  Doesn't have LEDs. The case is built like a tank and the stock keycaps are phenomenal. 
CM Masterkeys Pro S, Ducky One TKL RGB and IKBC F87. There's also the Asus ROG Claymore nearing release. 
Ducky shine 5/Leopold FC980M. 
Asking all the right questions here. I think the keycap came from a GMK set. The quality felt really nice, I think it was a high quality ABS. 
Hey! Welcome to the hobby. I was just curious, you know gateron clears and cherry clears are completely different right? \n\nI'm just asking because some people think the gateron variant of cherry clears is similar. 
I'm not too familiar with the pricing on Ducky boards. But I can say this subreddit is all about burning holes in pockets. Therefore I say pull the trigger.
Reminds me a lot of GMK Pyro. That's a beautiful board :)

Ah gotcha. OP, I guess you'll just have to settle for what the market has or you can learn to develop what you want.

I wouldn't suggest getting mx browns, they feel like reds but scratchier. I'd opt for cherry mx clears, but gateron browns are fine. 
I would've hopped on it if the rgb version was in stock. Looks like Tesoro ain't doing so hot with that 50% off. 
I've thought about going with a docking station solution, looking like it might be there way to go. You've had good results? What kinda monitors are you running of of it?
Sorry for the lateness. The footage is the sony XAVC-S, after reading around, it does seem like FCPX needs to transcode this. Which is insane that (1) *it doesn't tell you that it's doing it* and (2) there's *literally no apple documentation about this*. FCP just goes! Do people not realize their footage suddenly doubles in size?

Yes. They are definitely audible. I was pretty turned off by it at first but I *really* got used to them. I pretty much don't hear them anymore and I'm grateful that they keep the comp so cool, multitasking is a breeze on this thing.

Bought overcast 1337 from /u/JudasM
In Asia we have a lot of different CS:GO clones that have established pro scenes. A lot of Korean players come from a game called Sudden Attack, and a lot of Thai/South East Asian players come from games called Point Blank and Special Forces. Mickie from Weedtime was actually the playoff MVP from the Point Blank championships. He is well known for his ridiculous accuracy, and for those of you asking about his hero pool, he plays a nasty Widow and Roadhog.
Exactly this. White fox wasn't that fun either, but the RS's are a real pain in the ass. \n\nWith the Tada, formatting, replacing the bin file, and reflashing was so simple. Highly recommend
How to deal with toxicity better at higher elo?\nReached 3500 this season after finishing placements at 3100 (3170 peak and finish season 2). \n\nBasically in high diamond and now masters solo q, if I don't snowball and kill everyone when I play DPS my teammates will complain for DPS to change and/or blame us for throwing the game. I feel like I'm doing quite well and am consistently not over extending, but I still get flamed a lot of the time. What are good ways to deal with this? Play only party? Is it maybe a South East Asian server thing? Any input would be appreciated. I rarely get flamed on Tank or support, so I do feel like there is some bias against DPS.\n\nMy profile for reference: http://masteroverwatch.com/profile/pc/us/Ultraman-11731

I'll tell you why it's in your best interest to learn new heroes: metas change. If one day Jeff Kaplan decides to send Road down to the garbage tier, then you'll just be a chump with a roadhog golden gun wondering why you're getting reported every game. \n\nMy cardinal rule in competitive has been to be able to play 1 hitscan, 1 projectile, 1 core tank, 1 off tank, 1 heal (unless you are a support main) at a consistent level. This way, you can solo q or party with no problems at all. Plus the game is way more fun this way.
Is there a database that has recorded a lot of the DSA/SA/GMK kits that's have released in the recent years? Would be super helpful in finding sets that I might want. 
Did it talk about any other financials? 
It's just the best isn't it? I feel guilty giving all my time to my Hhkb though after dropping so much on keycaps alone...

He's still committed to his team Weedtime (technically sWeedtime). Oputo has stated on his stream that Mickie doesn't really have any plans on officially joining Envy and is focused on getting back to Weedtime for their Asian qualifiers (not 100% confirmed though). \n\nAlso for those of you wondering, Mickie only plays tanks/flex out of necessity, his preferred main was Widow and he also plays a ridiculously good Roadhog. Oputo has stated that he just gets shutdown when playing vs Mickie's RH.\n\nVod of Oputo Genji vs Mickie RH around 26 minutes in: https://youtu.be/FsaIn978oNY

Nice try, Ray
The card you're looking for is around an AMD 480, 1050ti, or a 1060 in terms of current gen cards. The cheapest you could go would be a 470, I'm not sure if a 460 could hit 144 fps at 1080.\n\nIf you're rocking an unlocked cpu though, you should probably go with a 1070. Most aftermarket cards in the 70 line have a pretty good price to performance ratio and have an amazingly low power draw.

Unless you're super desperate for something that only they have, it's best to avoid them. They have a pretty poor reputation on MFC. They sell products they don't have and order them from rakuten/Amazon when somebody buys from them. If the price they advertise puts them at a deficit, they'll tell you they have no stock and cancel your order. I heard they used to ship figures in brown paper bags and you'd have to pay like 6 dollars if you wanted your figure shipped in a box...
For those who are looking for the same product, ZealPC sold out of them but there is great news. He stocks a newer revision of the switch tops! They are used with his zealios switches and are said to be an improvement over the previous edition. Here's a link to them: http://zealpc.net/products/gateron-rgb-transparent-switch-top\n\nI highly recommend his site as well. I e-mailed him and got a reply within 2 hours. My package was also dispatched with 24 hours of paying. 
Thanks for the good news :) Just for clarification, is the thickness of the tip okay for led soldering? Temperature? Or are those irrelevant with just the 25W being the most important factor?

I was about to buy this a few hours ago but the shipping to Australia from mechanicalkeyboards was too expensive. Not to mention the exchange rate sucking hard. So happy this is up, cheers OP!
Yes but it's a low tier item that expires. I wouldn't bother with one unless your other equips are all done or just just plan on leaving it at rare/epic. 
Just a question: is the chattering issue fixed in these switches? Or are they the same as the old ones but with different colours? I read somewhere that the housing on the bottom melted or something in the old batch (causing deformations and chattering as a result) and was wondering if the same could possibly happen to this batch. Is there a way to avoid possible damage to the housing when soldering?
Easy horntail 
The minimum level required for CRA is 180. The only way to get CRA equips any earlier would be to get them through some kind of event (Maplehood gachapon) or some RNG-based gambling like marvel machine (which I'm not sure if we have access to in reboot).

Check out MechKB, they have both the clear and red switches in a black case. https://mechkb.com/vortex-poker-8\n\nThey're based in Australia so you'll get your item quickly. I think it was 12 dollars for express (Startrack.. never again) shipping to VIC.
Return policy is great. As long as it looks unworn and in original packaging when you return it, it's all good :) \n\nEdit: just to clarify, you can try it on at home. I'm sure some people buy multiple sizes and just return the ones that don't fit them.

I believe the song you are looking for is called Kage Futatsu
I was testing some of these switches and one of them was constantly getting stuck. I opened it up and noticed some grit/gunk where the leaves touch the stem and giving them both a good rub seemed to alleviate the problem. I figured cleaning the switches would be a good idea to make them all consistent with each other. \n\nAlso to get rid of any factory lube (if there is any) before I apply my own. 
I'm guessing you're Australian based on the design of that website. Please don't buy this from jb hifi! You're getting charged way too much for the mouse. Head to your nearest MSY or other computer store - they're over 20 dollars less. 
First off, S340 is a beautiful case! Great choice!\n\nSearch eBay for 'vinyl decals' with any extra filters (anime titles, character names, colours, etc.)
Everybody in Amaburi :D
Ducky shine 5 in your desired switch type :) Full sized, removable cable, rgb lighting, any mainstream cherry switch 
Used a 70% scroll and it failed without the equip blowing up. Guess that confirms it. Thanks guys!
If it's just across their torso, yeah. Over one shoulder, nope! 
20% mesos obtained /s \n\nIn all seriousness, probably buff duration. 
The Iconic (http://www.theiconic.com.au/) has some decent sales going on right now but it started a while ago and the best items/sizes are probably gone. Still worth checking out though!\n\nExcellent shipping rates (free express shipping if spending over 100 dollars), free and lenient return policy, great brands.
There might be a daily limit like the coins but you can definitely get more than one per account. I'm pretty sure you'd be able to get the skin in Scania. 
Hey there fellow Australian! \n\nWhat I do is buy from any good Japanese online store. Amiami, HLJ, mandarake, Hobby search, BiJ, N-Y, etc. Buying from US and EU stores generally isn't worth the wait and shipping costs and figures in Australia are usually marked up like crazy. 
I looked at their site but I'm only allowed to buy 1 :( Perhaps that's all they have left

Nah, they don't. I think they changed it so all potential scrolls, even your good ol' tradable 70/90%s, won't blow up your equips anymore. I asked this myself on reddit and tested it out in-game. Unless the scroll says it can blow up equips, it shouldn't be able to.
I don't remember the number but definitely enough to get any trait from 1 to 30. 
So you reckon the tip size and temperatures are okay to work with?\n\nAs for the 3 seconds, would you leave the iron on the joint for about 3 seconds, apply solder and just pull both off the joint? Or is there a better/safer way?

The general consensus is Deimos Shadow Shield being the most obtainable late game one. It's probably the best one you can get. I found the recipe at mutant ribbon pigs. 
Yeah, hoping I can get them cheaper :D I was too slow to grab 60 for 15 dollars on GH so I want to see if I can get approximately that price. I'll settle for the ones on Zeal's site if the issue is fixed though. 
The iconic sell them but they're not 130 dollars unless they're on sale. Even when they are, they might not even reach that price point unfortunately.

Amiami, hobby link Japan, hobby search, big in japan and mandarake are some of the many sites you can buy anime/gaming merchandise. Amiami and mandarake are probably the two best stores for preowned items. 
I'm guessing these will only take plate mounted switches according to the pictures? I wanted to swap these out with Zealios but I don't wanna snip the bottom bits off in case I want to use them for a PCB-mounted project in the future :(
First off, thank you for doing something so great :D\n\nMy first experience with mechanical keyboards goes all the way back to 2011 when I touched my friend's blackwidow. I liked it because it was different. I haven't even heard of mechanical keyboards until that point. Unfortunately I didn't have any money so the dream of owning a mechanical keyboard at this point was unrealistic.\n\nMechanical keyboards were out of my mind for a few years until my friend picked up a 6GV2. This lead me to buying my first board - a Ducky Shine 3 YOTS which I bought last year from a local retailer. I thought mechanical keyboards were just a gaming thing since the local stores only sold gaming-branded keyboards with Ducky being the most neutral-looking of them all. I was already browsing reddit but I only used it to get updates for anime-related stuff. Eventually, I stumbled upon this sub and realized how vast the mechanical keyboard world was. \n\nDespite being exposed to the world of mechanical keyboards, I honestly never thought I would get sucked into it. I thought I was satisfied with my Ducky Shine 3 with stock keycaps because I never saw the appeal of 60%s, beige, granite, etc. that everybody here loved. I was seriously thinking why would you want to use a keyboard from the 1980's without a numpad?! It was absurd to me that people would handicap themselves like that! I also didn't see the need to have multiple keyboards because I was still thinking that a keyboard was just a tool for getting input into your computer. \n\nI started getting involved with the community after buying my first set of aftermarket keycaps. I bought the Vortex doubleshot backlit thick PBT/POM keycaps from massdrop because they were affordable. From there, I realized how fun customizing keyboards is and looked into buying more keycaps and keyboards. Since then, I've changed my views on many things. All it took was for me to get out of my comfort zone and start being part of the community for me to start appreciating what everybody here loves doing. It excites me seeing people's build logs, custom builds/keysets almost anything, really! Since then, I've bought keycaps, LED colour changers, wrist rests, cases and my favourite purchase of all, a poker II (which I absolutely love - it's adorable, haha). 60%s are neato!\n\nNow, I'm sourcing goodies to build a winkeyless B.face X2 keyboard. I haven't been this excited for anything in a long time and I have this community to thank for it. I'm really happy there is a community for me to turn to to talk about this hobby because all the people I know have my old mindset - that keyboards are just tools and not works of art. \n\nI don't regret being a part of the community at all. If there's anything I regret, it's that I should have joined earlier. I missed out on so many group buys, LOL.\n\nSorry for the long and somewhat unstructured post. This post finally allowed me to express how I felt regarding my hobby from the beginning to the end so I just typed with my emotions and not my head.\n\nRegarding stem preference, I'd have to go with Cherry since I don't have a Topre board. I'd love to experience what they feel like one day though.

First of all, welcome to the world of figure collecting :)\n\nmyfigurecollection.net do not sell figures directly, they are just a database for figures. They do have classified ads though so you can buy from other users through that system. \n\nSome prize figures do look better in person than their stock images. From personal experience, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/135169 is such an item. For more accurate representations of figures, look at user pictures.\n\nIf you have any questions such as where to purchase, shipping methods, etc., feel free to PM me any time. I am happy to help anybody who wants to get into the hobby. For now, check out https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures, plenty of useful information there!
Nope, this is the multi version and I believe none of the multi versions are overclockable.

This is one of my favorite things about Geogaddi. Each song is so intricate, you can focus on one part, and find something you've never heard before. It's like zooming in on a fractal.
We've known the universe is billions of years old since around the 1960's.
Aw yeah. I've been on a massive BoC binge recently. What an amazing group.
I'm not really qualified to evaluate the claims, but there are papers out there that say holographic gravity has been disproven by experiments.
If you've got the time, money, and will -- try to power through it. Math is hard for almost everybody, but you do get better with practice. And learning about the origins of the universe is one of the most wonderful things there is.
The expansion of space-time can be derived from Einstein's field equations of General Relativity. This theory has been verified to very high precision in a number of systems. For example, Mercury's orbit precesses due to the squishing of space-time near the Sun's gravitational well. Even alternative theories of gravity like TeVeS reduce to GR in certain limits, so they produce stretching space-time and cosmological redshift.\n\nWithout some reasoning behind your claim, or an alternate explanation for cosmological redshift as we see it, I don't take your doubt very seriously. If redshift isn't associated with expansion, why does it scale with distance?
This is what my astronomy advisor refers to as "fucking stupid."\n\nJokes aside, I'm pretty sure this guy is still just salty about pluto being declassified.\n\n>Stern is famous for NASA’s New Horizons mission, which made its spectacular flyby of Pluto in July 2015.
Do we know the composition of these bodies? Based on my very limited knowledge, it seems like we should be able to determine whether it came from crust or proto-solar material based on the density and moment of inertia.

Cosmologists use the Friedmann equations to describe the expansion of the universe. We take these and plug in values for parameters like the amount of matter and dark energy in the universe, and we can roll back the clock to see when events occured.\n\nIt's not unlike taking a picture of a falling rock, measuring its speed, and figuring out when it was dropped and from how high. It's a combination of mathematical models and observational evidence.
If I'm fucking a model who's bleached their asshole, I should remove my shirt first.

Okay, so these computers are better at solving NP-complete problems than classical computers. But the relationship between BQP and NP is a bit uncertain, so it seems wrong to call this "stronger than a quantum computer" until that's better understood.\n\nStill, extremely cool stuff. Someone with more computer science knowledge is going to have to explain how this actually works though.
Not to mention neutrinos are called baryons and planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets. Lots of bad names in astronomy.
You don't. I was trying to come up with a good analogy but kinda failed. The important information is that you know where the rock is at a given time, and you know how fast it is going. With that info you can figure out when and where it was dropped from.
>you had a Neptune-like world that was too close to its parent star, the intense radiation would boil off not only the hydrogen and helium, but the majority (or even all) of the atmosphere on the world entirely\n\nThis contradicts what I've heard from people doing research in this field, as well as my intuition. Are there any studies that have looked into this?
Critical questions like these are why we need more funding for physics reseach.
I've got that on a poster in front of me haha
That article says they found the hydrogen atmosphere escaping, but not other elements. This is what I'd expect, and contradicts the original article posted.
We define the laws of physics specifically to be the things that don't change with time. Currently, the standard model of physics can handle everything up to and including the electroweak era on the graph here. Before that, with grand unified theories, there are some good ideas, but it's not that well understood.
Dammit, good catch.
Definitely don't feel stupid. It took 3-ish years of an undergrad astronomy degree for me to understand this. Although you could learn the names and concepts (in a rough sense) with a few afternoons on Wikipedia.

As I understand it, the gist of your argument is that people who are overweight are at risk of doing bodily or psychological harm by reducing calorie consumption without eating more healthy food at the same time.  You also say that calorie restriction is too difficult to be an effective way to lose weight for most people.\n\nAssuming that's right, you would expect people (diabetic and otherwise) who sharply limit their calorie intake or stop eating entirely to experience negative health outcomes. Also, you would expect to see attempts at these diets to fail at a high rate. Scientific studies show neither of those things to happen. In fact, calorie restriction, fasting, or intermittent fasting have all been shown to be *incredibly fucking healthy*. Please read what I've posted of these studies:\n\n[Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-90-481-3999-6_12)\n>In humans, CR [calorie restriction] appears to provide protection from type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases, immunological decline with age, malignancy, hepatotoxicity, liver fibrosis and failure, sarcopenia, systemic inflammation, and DNA damage. CR also reduces fat mass, including cardiovascular disease-related visceral fat mass, enhances muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, affords neuroprotection, and according to some retrospective epidemiological human studies, extends mean and maximum lifespan. Many of these benefits can be induced by relatively brief periods of CR in flies, rodents, monkeys and humans.\n\n[Therapeutic fasting in patients with metabolic syndrome and impaired insulin resistance.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434756)\n\n>After [fasting] therapy, body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR [a measure of insulin resistence -- high values are bad] were all significantly reduced. Compared to baseline, HOMA-IR decreased by 33% in all patients, by 38% in patients with type 2 diabetes, and by 23% in patients without diabetes.\n\n>No serious side effects were observed.\n\n[Fasting: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Applications](http://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131\\(13\\)00503-2)\n\n>We now know that fasting results in ketogenesis; promotes potent changes in metabolic pathways and cellular processes such as stress resistance, lipolysis, and autophagy; and can have medical applications that, in some cases, are as effective as those of approved drugs such as the dampening of seizures and seizure-associated brain damage and the amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis\n\n[Alternate Day Calorie Restriction Improves Clinical Findings and Reduces Markers of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Overweight Adults with Moderate Asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859864/?tool%3Dpmcentrez)\n\n>Ten subjects with BMI>30 were maintained for 8 weeks on a dietary regimen in which they ate ad libitum every other day, while consuming less than 20% of their normal calorie intake on the intervening days\n\n>**Compliance with the ADCR diet was high**, symptoms and pulmonary function improved, and oxidative stress and inflammation declined in response to the dietary intervention. These findings demonstrate rapid and sustained beneficial effects of ADCR on the underlying disease process in subjects with asthma, suggesting a novel approach for therapeutic intervention in this disorder.\n\nThis isn't cherry-picked by the way. These were the first four studies I found while googling this. One point I'd like to make is that in none of these studies were people starving. You can restrict calories without going into a starvation state, as long as you have a supply of fat in your body. The "Fasting: ..." article draws very distinction.

This would be too dim to see with your naked eye unfortunately. The wiki page states it's dimmer than NGC 205 which has an apparent magnitude of 9, which is already well outside the visible range.
Cosmological redshift is a consequence of the theory of general relativity, which has been verified to extraordinarily high precision. Scientists didn't just pick cosmological redshift as the go-to theory because it was convenient. It was the result of decades of research arguments and observations.\n\nYou can derive cosmological redshift yourself, starting from the Friedman equations.
Holy fuck I'm jealous.
>[citation needed]\n\n[Here's the wiki page on IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Social_correlations). While not a good source in itself, you can follow links on the page to the original research.\n\nHere are some statements I copied from that article that make me think IQ is a useful measurement:\n\n*  children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers\n\n* IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations\n\n* The US military has minimum enlistment standards at about the IQ 85 level. There have been two experiments with lowering this to 80 but in both cases these men could not master soldiering well enough to justify their costs\n\nI think the first two quotes are important, but the last is the most convincing to me. Based on these studies, IQ has an immediate, practical use for improving the efficiency and combat-readiness of the military.\n\n>That's like trying to give an accurate 2D layout of a 3D object like Earth\n\nI think this is a good analogy. Maps distort Earth, and certainly don't give a complete picture. But despite that, they're very useful for navigation.
What the fuck is wrong with you reddit? Do you have needle-like fingers and half-ply toilet paper?
Really? I've been using p or center click to paste. Am I doing it wrong?
Depends on how many stars you're trying to map. This timeline hasn't changed much since the late 1990's, with the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe. A couple years later the Tycho-2 catalog was released with 2.5 million stars. That number is pretty damn small compared to the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy. The Gaia spacecraft is currently making a new catalog which is expected to have 1 billion objects by the time it's complete.
Oooh please tell me how you like it! I grew up with the game so I've got nostalgia glasses firmly attached to my face. I'm curious how well the game holds up nearly 20 years later.
Is it legal to demand someone to not record a raid? I know police cannot legally force you to not record in public (not that it stops them from trying), but this could be different in a private business.
Lol, my state had a similar issue with bestiality being legal. No one thought they needed to make a law against fucking animals until some guy got fucked to death by a horse.
Yes. There might be some limitations, but I haven't run into any yet. I've tried Xfce, Unity, KDE, and I3 (under Xfce) in Ubuntu, although not all at the same time.

Senior-year undergrad here. For a surface-level understanding, I'd say yes. For example, I don't have a good mathematical understanding of General Relativity (which requires tensor calculus), so I don't *really* understand the Schwarzschild radius. But given an equation for it, I can follow the derivation and appreciate the results.

It's really a thermodynamic limit for the minimum amount of energy / entropy involved in self-replication.\n\n>The "explanation of the origin of life" (abiogenesis), when it is found, will involve mainly (1) chemistry, (2) the logic / math of Darwinian evolution. Yes, the explanation will also be enriched by insights from other fields, including thermodynamics and including this paper. But the heart of the explanation will be (1) and (2), and cannot come from pure physics.

We have direct evidence for the things you see on this graph going back to the creation of the CMB at ~400,000 years. Our understanding of physics is very solid back to electroweak unification at 0.01ns. It's only when you go further back that things get pretty speculative.

With no disrespect intended to the OP of that thread, I feel like easily-answered questions like theirs might be better off on /r/space, /r/astronomy, /r/askscience or /r/askphysics. Would it be appropriate to ask people to ask their questions in one of those subreddits first, and come here if they don't get a satisfactory answer? This is more-or-less /r/physics relationship with /r/askphysics, and it seems to work fairly well.\n\nOffhand, but I really love /r/math. I think they're the best academic-level subreddit.

This does bring up an interesting point. Trump's team really seem to operate on the premise that if enough people say the same thing, it becomes the truth. This works in some cases, but I really doubt this can keep working in the long run.\n\nIt really muddies the waters when a verifiably false statement is repeated over and over again. A lot of effort has to be put into correcting that statement than just making it and claiming it to be true. One side is always on the defensive and has a hard time keeping up. You'd think eventually the side making the statements start to lose credibility, but it seems to be working for them so far.

But how did he tie them together?
You know, a lot of people, a lot of smart people, are saying you should believe me
I was 6 at the time. I didn't even speak English. I remember watching the news report with my parents that evening and how everyone was talking about it even though it happened half way around the globe.
sure
like inside the wall?
Dreams *do* come true!
I'm not resisting, it's the rigor mortis!
Is the 5ft in addition to the coil? I'm needing something with length but would like a coil as well. 
Same CPU and mobo for me. I set it to adaptive + offset at 1.189 (best number for me) and left the offset at auto. I had to set the LLC to 4 to have it not go much higher than what I set. If I really push the CPU it'll go to 1.120 but no higher and usually just maxes at what I set. Still goes to idle state around .78. Let me know if you want screenshots or something. 
Glad to see Imgur hasn't flamed you for using an "under powered" psu like they usually do. Nice build and good choices!
You and me both. This will be my first cap purchase!
I was second guessing myself after replying and now I think I did actually have it on the default static pink option and hadn't toggled through far enough to get to white. I know the white is not pure white but I'm pretty sure that I did have it on pink now that I think about it. If you were thinking about getting one I can double check if it's a concern you have. 
That's correct. You'd want to find out where each psu operates at peak efficiency and then do your best calculation of what your computer will need. Either one will probably be fine though. 
This was answered before but, "It's the total length of the cable. So it'll be 6" of coils followed by 4.5ft of straight cable."
Gotcha, thanks. Looks like mechkeys has a similar option I might have to checkout. Your boards look great by the way!
No, it's real life.
Happy New Years! Hope you wake up…
Probably still got placed higher than me. I'm back in hell. 
This is excellent! I recently did a very similar build in the RVZ02 and was able to keep things really clean with the SF450 too. For anyone interested in this case I posted it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5m2ibp/consoleish_sized_gaming_build_rvz02_gtx_1060_i7/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5m2ibp/consoleish_sized_gaming_build_rvz02_gtx_1060_i7/) 
Is this where I insert the picture of the girl from the taco commercial saying "why not have both"?
Yeah I don't know what they're on about. I find imgur feels they always need to overcompensate when I see builds on there. It is totally fine with a 450. 
Wow this is beautiful! Have you ever tried ergo clears? I currently am using them but thinking about the MOD-M or MOD-H any insights into what I might like? I like the tactile bump and a bit of a heavier spring but I also game with it. \n\nGreat board you have though!
I got mine on the 23rd of December. A Christmas miracle! Here's my build if anyone's interested: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/YTw6Mp
I'm not a cool kid but my rabbit is pretty cool. 
I'm looking into using WealthSimple, how has your experience been? I don't know anything about investing but am thinking about getting into it but in the meantime want to put my money to good use. What kind of return are you getting, and how easy would it be to move money in and out?
/u/waikane will the Saber have the same aluminum case offered as the TADA68? And this case you're prototyping, can you speak on how it would differ from the current aluminum case?\n\nBy the way I'm sure everyone is appreciating the regular updates and transparency from you!
How is your system using that much power? I ask because I just built with a 450W and 1060 + 6700K. Also, how did you measure your power draw?
Pssh, did this years ago with the millennium falcon in Shadows of the Empire. What an unforgiving game. 
How would one go about getting one of these?
I remember when I got Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast I was grounded from using the computer. I read that manual cover to cover so many times! To bad games don't come with them anymore…
I have a lot of success grouping them somewhat close together to maximize impact but I try to put them far enough apart that they don't all get taken out at once. Usually put them on a single choke point that must be passed and put them on the objective side so enemy doesn't see them as they pass through. This requires them to pause, turn around, and deal with them before proceeding which gives defence a lot of time to just pick the enemy off. I try to follow the tips that Skyline shows in his YouTube video for Symmetra and it works really well. 
Ugh. How did I miss this TADA? I've been looking for this with the MODs. 
Actually looks like he's making a gingerbread man.
If you can sneak symmetra around to their spawn you can place a teleported inconspicuously and then before they find it you all teleport in and take the flag.\n\nBut yeah, it's often a draw. 
🙌
That sucks. I would suggest checking r/mechmarket as a lot of people have the Anne. I bought mine from somebody there and I'm in Canada too. 
It's hitting around 70-74 depending on which game I'm playing.
Heh, snowball…
I never win but I always try
I came to the same conclusion and bought one off of another Reddit user. Excited for my first mech as well!
Not saying you didn't do the right thing, but you went way way over what we would offer normally to any given customer. I'm amazed you were allowed to do what you did let alone that you had the admin rights to do so on those locked down floater computers. Good job though!
It's an Anne Pro, so yep, it's a Bluetooth backlit keyboard. \nHe's learned not to chew on cables though. 
Did I miss it? I saw the placeholder page appear on your website but now it's gone!
Oh man, I would have definitely dumped those glitter stars into my keyboard by accident!
Also just purchased one (hasn't arrived yet) after a lot of research. Anne seems to have the best of everything for the money. BT can have some issues sometimes apparently but overall sounds like a great board. 
Yep, another plus for 1password!
We are: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5uveob/minilop_for_scale/?st=IZDMZ3C2&sh=6393af62
Well you and I can be outdated together then. This is one opinion I will not budge on. In the end, it's up to the user to decide what's best for themselves and we can only guide that experience. Using relative units is the best way to ensure that things will remain proportionate if the user is zooming or changing default font sizes. 
It'll use the same amount of power but the 650 may not be as efficient with such little draw. Either way it'd probably be negligible from an electric bill perspective. 
I overclocked to 4.3 but actually undervolted to about 1.19. Under gaming load it's usually around 65 and under Real Bench it is 75-80. 
Feels bad from Canada too
Could be. It's really too bad for originative but it's hard to blame these other sellers when Originative isn't stocking this board and is having trouble with shipping. I'll be buying from them though cause I want those MOD-Ms and aluminum case. 
The cavalry is here!
I'd really like one of these! Nobody is selling them on mechmarket for good reason but Originative can't stock them fast enough. Hopefully soon…
I don't know what's weirder, the fact that she hasn't changed, or that you have all those calendars still.
Right? But then I'm worried I'll never remember to check it in my pocket feed even though I never look at it again in Safari anyways. 
"So, that's the best you can do?" In any negotiation.
I've worked with Middleman for small static sites and Wordpress or Craft for larger/dynamic ones. Static HTML and CSS isn't a burden to update with so many pre/post processors, compilers, and minifiers so if they don't need to update their content then definitely go static. Both Wordpress and Craft can use Twig as a template language (Timber for the former) and I find unless I'm really needing to do something custom in terms of dynamic output that you don't really write a lot of PHP anymore. 
Oh, don't get me wrong. I use IFTTT with pinboard and pocket and it helps immensely but I still find myself with dozens of open tabs. Just can't break the habit!
I use both but find 1password to be more reliable. I've had Safari auto generate a password but then the URL slightly changes and it makes it very difficult to pull up the password without the Mac Keychains Access app. 
I've been testing my rig with the SF450 and the psu fan has not even turned on yet. So it's very quiet and I can't really tell how loud it would be if it turned on because it hasn't!
I've read really good things about the MSI Gaming X. I personally have the 1060 version and it's cool and quiet. 
Get out while you can! 
The case comes with an adapter that fits into the mobo PCI-E slot and so yes, they are parallel.

Upvote for great breakfast!
For perspective I have a 6700K with the Big Shuriken 2 in an RVZ02 (so very similar build). When I run synthetic benchmarks my CPU gets to about 80° but under normal usage it maxes around 65° which is totally fine. You're well within a normal temperature and if you're getting your power savings along with a stable voltage then I wouldn't worry much more. 
Cross device/brand compatibility
What the kids don't know is that this is a gif but it's so slow it appears to be a still image
Okay, going to try it now.. :D
I have a 1060. I like the 1060 and you will like the 1060 too. But seriously. Check to see if games you like run better on the 480 now and then decide. Also keep in mind the 1060 uses less power if that's a concern. 
I'm not sure if I'm missing what you are missing about the Q but the O seems to form the ring and the P forms the line the through the O so you get Q. It seems strange because the Q is then placed higher than the P but it works. 
Whoops! Well OP, nice set!
Right, from preproduction builds… wait til we see final release
EVERYTHING IS IN CAPS AND THAT IS DIFFICULT TO READ OVER A LONG STRETCH OF TEXT LIKE THIS!
Can't wait to get mine too! Nice photo.
What is up with that font though?
If using the big shuriken make sure your ram has enough clearance. I have it and went with corsair lpx memory which fits great. The 480 does seem to be the better value over the 1060 right now. If you want a similar example you can check out my build: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/YTw6Mp\n\nDifferent case but similar idea. 
Oh my goodness, it's Planet Coaster all over again. 
Yep! Thanks for making that demo. Hope the drop is successful. I know I'll be in on it.  
Thanks! The backlight is actually set to "white" but it's definitely a soft pink.
I originally bought the Wii U just for the Zelda game that would release on that platform so I damn well better get it on the Wii U. 
37245
Yep. Smaller may be better. Just keep in mind the possibility of new parts or SLI may increase your power usage. If you'll just be using a single card you'd be fine with the 550. 
I agree with the scythe. It's keeping my 6700K cool and it's fairly quiet. 
Unfortunately the *special* part about this 1060 is that it's in Canadian dollars. It is definitely a more expensive variant of the 1060 as well but I just really wanted it. It did seem like the quietest and coolest available at the time too. Good luck with your build!
I like it quite a bit. Keeps things cool, is quiet, fits, and was easy to install (I don't have a reference point however)! Good luck with your build!
I also have the same setup but haven't experienced any lag or repeater issues so far when on Bluetooth. Your review helped push me over the edge to buy this board. 
Depends on the quality of your gpu and how often you plan to use your computer at its max. With a good 300W psu you should be fine even if you were running at max
Check the LLC settings and play around with the numbers. Start with 3-4. Also, my bios had all the power saving settings at their defaults but I made sure I set them to enabled instead of auto just to be sure. 
Me, anytime I get up. 
But later they will meet together in an abandoned development house and start learning the five movements… mysterious ways 
Came here to make this comment. Comment already made!
Aim for around 50% load or look at a few PSU's and find their peak efficiency and compare to your usage. I have a 6700K and a GTX 1060 in a mini-itx build with the SF450 and everything is running just fine. 
I think they meant their own post was pretentious, not yours!
Hrmh, I should have just purchased the Plum cable from you rather than Massdrop because it's cheaper shipping. But if it helps with your sales I'm glad that I got in on it!
I think you're doing just fine. Sounds like you understand your settings and your temps and voltage is very good. You could push it further even if you wanted to. I know you said you don't want to though. 
I'm not sure if it's you that answered on the Massdrop page but I just wanted to double confirm as to whether these are reverse coiled so that they keep their coil when stretched or if they'd relax from being pulled on. Also, do you know how closely this would match the Plum keyset?
Confirmed
Wow these responses are actually logical and a reasonable comparison of amd vs nvidia. Personally I have the 1060 but would have gone with the 480 if I could do it again, but I play at 1080p. If I was aiming for 1440 at 144 then yeah, a 1070 or even a 1080 might be required depending on the game. The PSU would probably need to bump up to 600 though and heat and noise may become an issue. 
I recently read the section in "The Food Lab" about poaching eggs. There are a lot of myths put to rest in there. Haven't tried it yet but I recommend checking it out if you like making your food more sciency. 
Thank you! I hemmed and hawed between the 1060 and the 1070 for a long time but for now I'm just doing 1080p gaming. In the future I might upgrade to 1440 or 4k so I'll have an excuse to upgrade then.
I'm having the same issue here. I find it mostly happens in competitive which is extremely annoying. I'll usually get to the hero select screen and then hear a distortion sound and then everything locks up and I need to do a forced reboot. I heard that it could be related to too many audio outputs being active. I've tried disabling all but one but I'm still temporarily banned from comp. 
I'm Canada. Been researching up a storm after being bit by the mech bug.
I can't find the place where I should solder the other end of the wire.\n\nHere are two pictures:\n\nhttps://img2.picload.org/image/rlaracpr/img_0377.jpg\n\nhttps://img2.picload.org/image/rlaraciw/img_0378.jpg\n\nI know I did a very bad soldering job, please ignore that. :D\n\nAs you can see in the pictures, I already soldered a wire to the pin where the pad misses.
Could you please desribe this for a noob?
Damn that's nice. Thanks!
Thank you! Going to take at look on them.
Looks very cool, especially the keyboards! I love the SA Danger Zone keycaps.\n\nWhich mouse do you like the most and how's the mouse pad? 
Pm'd
Ah totally forgot about PMK because I heard everyone who bought something from there to Germany had to pay a lot of customs.. But I'm going to check out that set!
I think I made a mistake and the escape doesn't function anymore. The silver ring around the place is destroyed. \n\nWhat can I do to fix it?\n\n\nHere's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Vaos5jo.jpg)
Okay thank you! :D\n\nWow didn't knew that, glad I ordered the LED's. I'm going to try that mod when everything arrives. :) Thanks for your help!
Would like to vote for three different switch types, because I like them all three! :D
Could you tell me if the sensor of the G102/G203 has a high LOD?\n\nJust ordered it very cheap in Germany and I'm curios if the sensor will be fine for the price. :)
Oh sorry to hear that and thanks! :)\n\nI don't know sorry..
I'm looking for an ISO SA keycap set. (Not the Filco set because it's always out of stock..)
Bought Pok3r from /u/Meluvis
I don't know if can desolder and solder the switches and LEDs.. I never did it. :D\n\nI think I can handle the painting well since I did other paint jobs on other computer parts in the past, but first I need to think about soldering. :D\n\nI think painting the case will be easier than the plate, but let's see! The little marks aren't a problem I guess since you only see a bit of it. :)
MX.\nInspiring me and helping me for years! No matter how stupid my question was, I got a kind answer for it.
Very nice collection! The black Poker X keyboard looks really good.
So I let the insulation on the cable and solder the two sides I cut the insulation of to the places?! \n\nSorry for asking so much questions.
The "Three tone - RGG" is listed under Topre keycaps but I can only chose "GMK" at switch type?! :(
Yeah saw them, but they're sold out..
Both look so nice! Where did you get the DSA keycaps?
That sounds like a good choice! But you really have a lot of keyboards. I couldn't decide and would type every 10 minutes on another one. :D\n\nWhy exactly do you like the Realforce more than the other Topre boards?
Haha yeah exactly! :D
Very nice! I might be interested on a set for the Germany layout, depending on the price. :)
It's a Pok3r. \n\nAs far as I see there was only the metal circle (stands alone and nothing touches it) and now there's the black circle.
Pm'd.
Oh okay! :D\n\nWhat's your favorite board of them? 
Thanks for the answer! Do you have any problems that the mouseskates of the FK2 get damaged with a plastic mousepad?\n\nYeah I also think that ergonomic mice are more the allrounder mice, but I also like mice like the FK2 more for gaming etc.
Damn, that looks so good! Especially the black/black DSA keycaps. Great job!
Yeah custom springs, lubing etc are also so interesting! :D
Hahaha yeah that would be nice and would make things so much easier for me! :D\n\nYeah I'll try it on other stuff first for sure! Did you need to buy anything else for doing that like new pins for the switches or did you only desolder them and solder them back in?
Haha that could be true! 
The nightmare became real! Stay strong..
Is there any SA or DSA profile keycap set with lettering in German ISO layout?
Pm'd.
Sadly the whole shop seems to be sold out.. :(\n\nVery nice keyboard and the keycap looks great on it. :)
You traded all of them away or only the Black Poker?\n\nNow you're only using Topre keyboards? :)
What case is that? The keyset and color combination looks very good!
Do you still using your keyboard on your desk? 
Candykeys.com (based in Germany) has some on stock as soon as their website goes online again.
Oh okay! :D Then I'll wait if the keycap set matches the case, otherwise I'll order this one too. Thank you! :)
Got a link to the spray paint too? :)
I don't think so, because every other key works flawless.. Before I put everything back in it worked.\n\nI thnk I found the problem. The silver ring around the place is destroyed. I tried to save it and have a half of this ring laying on my table. \n\nWhat can I do now?\n\n\n[picture](http://i.imgur.com/Vaos5jo.jpg)
Yeah that would be nice and very helpful!
Yeah! I want to lube my boards definitly in the future!
Haha wow! I just saw that post and clicked on the video and was like "Wow that's a video I was searching for!" and now I saw that it's you! :D Thank you so much dude!\n\nI think I like the sound of the plastic case more.. The sound is "deeper", I can't describe it. :)
Could you tell me where that could be on this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Vaos5jo.jpg)?\n\nI have really no idea..
Yeah I like the newer Zowie FK Series more than the old ones.\n\nTrue!
Pm'd.
What mice do they use? SteelSeries Rival 100? 
It looked like this before: http://i.imgur.com/OqqQ1qR.jpg\n\nand now I put a bit of glue to the stem in the keycap that it fits the standard layout.
Ah that's nice! :D\n\nYeah I have good soldering station from my grandpa, which should get the job done. Going to look for videos etc. and then it should work out! :D
The original stem is "cut" off, so you can glue it on the position that you need it to be.\n\nIf you use the keycaps for example on a Pok3r you can glue it in the middle and if you want to use it on the Cherry keyboard you can glue it back on it's original position.\n\nHere's a picure of how it can look like if it's glued in the position for a standard layout: http://i.imgur.com/Vk9CmiG.jpg
Sold keycaps to /u/AtActionPark-
Yeah I already took a look on these sets but every set I found had a non standard caps lock and space bar key which won't fit on other boards or standard layout ISO boards..
Wow nice, congratulations! :)
Haha of course, because I have a white Pok3r on it's way to me for my brother and I want to make the backplate/case black. If I do it I thought (thanks to your post) I can add LEDs too so I ordered them too. :D\n\nSure but I'll guess it will take a lot of time for the LEDs to arrive. :D
No worries! So you think a cheap primer and a few layers of spray paint will be enough? :D\n\nAnd this was a Pok3r without any LED's on, right? Did you just install the LED's and they are on the for the whole time or can you turn them of through a software or something?
Guess you're a fan of Rem? ;)\nLooks very nice!
I tried it but it's impossible to connect a wire from the pcb place to the pin because the distance is so short.. The only thing I could do is using a longer wire or solder the complete wire that connects to the parts?\n\nAlso the solder doesn't "hold" on the PCB without the silver ring..
True!\n\nYeah true, but the FK1/FK2 has harder clicks, why I would recommed it totally for FPS games but not so much for MOBA/RTS games.\n\nThese both are great mice too! 
Just asking. :)
Ah yeah I already saw someone who recommened his videos, guess I'll look it up and hope that the LEDs arrive fast! :D\n\nDo you maybe know if I buy new switches, do I have to buy pins separately or can I solder them on my board like I'd do with the desoldered ones?
Happy Birthday! :)
Here you go https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1jvubf/reddit_keyboard_spill_guide/\n\nHope you can save this beauty! :)
I hope I can do it.. :D That's true, especially when it comes from China to Europe.\n\nYeah that sounds nice, too! :D I guess that could look very cool or the whole modifier in white!
Damn this looks cool! Your dog looks really cool! :)
That's so cool! Really dude :D 
Only together, sorry.
Sold a HHKB Pro 2 to /u/dReamX420
Thanks a lot for your answers! The specs are nice, we have the same CPU. Guess that case goes on my list and the Corsair Quiet edition fans sound very good if they're quiet as you write.\n\nThank you for your help! :)
Yeah I definitely take on look on these, especially the dye sub set!
Oh okay! Then I can think about other mods aswell if everything goes good :D\n\nThanks a lot! :)
Hey,\n\nI lifted the silver circle pad (as you can see on this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Vaos5jo.jpg)) and now the escape key doesn't function on my Pok3r. I read something to solder a copper wire to the pin of the switch on one end and the other end to the metal that the the silver circle was connected to.\n\nI can't find the place where I should solder the other end of the wire.\n\nCan someone tell me where I should solder the other end of the wire?\n\nHere are two pictures:\n\nhttps://img2.picload.org/image/rlaracpr/img_0377.jpg\n\nhttps://img2.picload.org/image/rlaraciw/img_0378.jpg\n\nAs you can see I already soldered a wire to the pin, I just need to know where I need to solder that wire..
> HADapter kits\n\nYeah I just saw it yesterday. Guess if I'll take a set of the OG Cherry keycaps I'll need to search for one.
No weights, since it's heavy enough and 800 DPI.
Oh no! Personally I love the shape of the SS Rival 100! The sensor has it's flaws but the mouse itself is totally great. If you like ambidextrous mice, I like the SS Rival 100 the most including the Logitech G102/G Pro of the newer mice.\n\nThe shape/design is classic and I totally understand why pros use this mouse. :)
Woah this looks so cool! I need to visit Osaka once I finally be able to visit Japan. :)
Very good to know, thanks a lot! Especially the last picture helps me a lot to improve my desk. :)
Okay thank you! How's the case compared to your Pok3r case in typing, sounds etc?
Ah very nice! Thinking about getting one for my brother's Pok3r too. :)\n\nThe case looks so cool! How's the case for typing? Could you compare it to the stock Pok3r case?
CLG is cool! :D\n\nVery nice setup!
That looks incredibly good, congratulations!\n\nCould you tell me what case that is and what specs the PC has? I was thinking about doing an M-ATX or ITX build next and I really like that case. :) How's the noise and the cooling?
How's the quality of the case? I was thinking about buying a black one, since it's so cheap.
Already fixed it. Connected the pin with a wire to the same pin of the "1" key and it works flawless now. Thanks a lot! :)
If you're from europe, probably candykeys.com
I have this [cable](https://i.imgur.com/KU6pgQ1.jpg) , is this okay?
No problem! :)
LMAO.  I guess no idea is a stupid idea.
Okay so just cutting a normal (any cable?) copper cable for this and solder it to the positions?\n\nThanks a lot to you both! Going to try this as soon as I get home.\n\n
Replied!
On /r/mechmarket or some keyboardshops.
Pm'd!
I use blanks on my HHKB since I use a "custom" layout and a lot of letters on the keycaps wouldn't match with the layout I use.
Wow okay! Could you help me more and show me where that would be on this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/axdBNgO.jpg)?
Just to be sure: So I should solder a normal cable to the pin and the other end of the cable to the pcb at the part where the silver ring was or to the other pin?\n\nSorry, I'm really a noob and want to be 100% sure that I understand what you're telling me, since english isn't my native language. :D
Yeah that's true, I know that "journey" too.. Sometimes I can't decide, too. I love Topre Switches but I still love MX clears or Gateron Browns..
I see! I'm always interested in ergonomics. By saying "arm rests" do you mean your elbows laying on the arm rests of your chair while typing on your keyboard?
The thing with affairs is that they are like drugs.   It is really hard for someone to stop it once they are in the middle of it.   That said, most affairs do end and when they do it brings misery to those in it, especially the spouses/partners.   In your roommates case, she is also having an affair with her boss with further complicates things.    Right now she is on a high and most likely anything you say or do will not make a difference.   I don' have any advice but just thought I give you something to consider if you do decide to talk to your roommate.   
A vortex core might be something to look into.  I've had mine for about a month now and use it a with my ipad/on the go.    I will say that it does take a little time to get use to at first but once you do it is a great keyboard to type on.   On top of that, they are readily available on Amazon - so no need to wait for something custom to come along.    
It sounds like your boyfriend still has unresolved feelings for his ex.   That is a red flag.   No matter how nice and great he may be, if he still thinks about his ex girl after two years, then he is not giving you everything you deserve from him.   While he may be able to give bits and pieces of himself - deep down he is holding back from being fully committed to you.   Is that what you really want?   Probably not.    Right now you need to see him as someone to hang out with and have fun, but not someone to be with long term.    \n\nBy the way, you are not an idiot - just someone who has not realized how not so great her boyfriend is.    There are definitely better men out there who are not carrying baggage from their past - so I wouldn't waste your time with this dude if you want something more serious.
I have the ducky shine 5 and couldn't be happier with it.   The ducky shine 6 is nicer because it has the USB passthrough ports plus has software to further customize (although many people still prefer to use the keyboard functions to adjust lighting rather than software - which the ducky gives you the option to do both with the shine 6).  In addition, having dedicated media keys for volume is a huge plus.  
So one of the issues I'm seeing here is that you are placing your worth and sense of well-being on your boyfriend.  That is a huge burden for any man to carry and eventually he is going to get tired of it.    What makes a relationship work is when two people who are whole come together with the purpose of giving towards the relationship.  Right now you are not in a position to give to your boyfriend.  Instead, you are using him to fulfill some void or emptiness that is in your life.    You don't want to get to a place where your boyfriend starts having resentment towards you because he feels like he has no space.    One of the things that makes a person attractive is when they wake up each day with a sense of purpose and excitement.   Right now you don't have a vision for your life outside of your boyfriend.  One of the keys in overcoming this is discovering what your passions, interests, hobbies and overall vision in life is.    What excites you? What are your dreams?   I would recommend trying different activities and doing new things without your boyfriend always being around - that is the only way you are going to find out what you like.   Speaking to someone about this would also help.   Deep down it sounds like there is something in you that says you are not good enough - which is causing you to cling to your boyfriend.     The truth is that you are good enough and you have value that the world needs.     You are in a rut but you can get out of it.   
That is embarrassing and so sorry you felt humiliated.   Unfortunately, your boyfriend is still very young and marriage is something that is far from his mind.   In your early twenties, there is a lot of growing up that needs to take place.  What your boyfriend did was insensitive but it doesn't sound like he meant it to be hurtful.   He probably was not even aware of what he was doing.    That goes back to maturity and him needing to become more self-aware of how his words/actions affect those around him, especially you.  I would talk to him about it and let him know how you felt.  If he is smart he will listen, apologize and learn from this.   Unfortunately, at that age you are not going to find a lot of mature men.    
Well, I was the one who asked for $250.   Overall, I see this as basic supply and demand.  With a supply that is very limited, people are going to be willing to pay higher prices.   I agree with the prior posts - it was admirable for him to accept $180.    I've been looking for this set for a while so $250 seemed reasonable given the time I've spent monitoring different forums trying to get this keyset
I can totally relate to how you are feeling.   I use to be extremely shy and afraid to speak up.   In addition, I grew up with a speech impediment that led to me being anxious around other people.   I can't say for sure what actually cause me to change, but the process was gradual for sure.    What I will say is that everything begins and ends with the mind - so you are going to have to work on changing your paradigm of the world.   Like prior people have commented, you really are in control of your life.     I do think seeing a therapist would help but there are also some good books out there that can help.  I highly recommend the book  "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Robert Glover.  It really helped me when I was going through a similar phase in life.  
You are in a tough situation but for relationships to really thrive, both partners must be in a place where they are able and willing to give to the other person.   Your girl friend has some real issues that are not going to be solved overnight.     Yet, it is up to her to decide if she wants to get help and work on making herself whole again.    Your job is to support and love her, but not to fix her.    Overtime if she does not address the issue herself, this will eventually start to impact other areas of your relationship.   As much as I hate to tell you this, your girl friend is not ready to be in a relationship.   This might come off as being cruel, unsupportive and selfish,  but in reality she is the one being selfish.    She knows she has problems but is not being proactive in getting them address.  In the meantime, you are continuing to give to the relationship but getting to the point where your love bank is almost depleted.    Eventually you are going to get resentful or at minimum, very frustrated with the relationship.    This is a delicate situation - so you will need to give this a lot of thought before you decide - but either way she is not at a place where she can fully give to the relationship. \n\n
I tried it today using layer 1 and it work!  Thanks for the help.  I've been experimenting the last few weeks with the core - definitely a learning curve for me but love it\n

Three and a half years is a long time to be with someone.   At this stage,  the expectation here really is that you are each focusing giving and meeting each others needs.   However, the fact he has intimacy issues and something from his past preventing him from giving this to you, lets me know that he is not ready to be in a relationship.   You deserve better than this.   He is being selfish and has not shown a willingness to work on this.   He is basically telling you through his actions that he does not care enough about you to be intimate.  It would be one thing if he was physically unable but in this case there is something internal holding him back.    Whatever it is, you will not be able to fix it.  He has to want to fix that.    I hate to tell you this but I think it is time for you to move on.   On aside note, it is not fun to be working at a job that you hate.    I really hope that you are able to find something that is more fulfilling soon.
Congrats.  Once you go MK there is no going back.  
I wouldn't send her anything.   She is in another relationship and that means she is off limits.   The other thing is that you are putting her on top of a pedestal - whenever that happens you subconsciously make yourself less than you are.   Although this is hard at the moment, you have to accept that she has moved on.  More importantly, you will find that there are a lot of other women out there who are actually better for you - that will have more of the qualities that you are looking for in a person.  
Daddy issues are always difficult to deal with because now matter how bad our fathers are, deep down most sons want their fathers to be there for them and to set the example of what manhood is.  My father for the most part was a real jerk.   He cheated on my mom,  never made time for me and treated his step kids better than his own.    Yet,  inside I find myself wishing that he would have been more, that he and I had a better relationship.    That is a lot energy that can boil inside a person but the key is using that energy to become a better man.     You have to become the very thing that was missing in your life.     And while your father is not the person your deserved,  the entire situation made you who you are today - when day you will be able to use that story as a testimony of no matter who bad our parents may be, we are still in control of our lives and don't have to become prisoners of their bad habits.
One of the keys to a successful relationship is having similar values, vision, hobbies and interest.    None of these are ever exactly aligned but they need to be somewhat close for the relationship to have a chance.   In this case,  your belief systems are potentially disjointed.   What about her actions on a day to day bases - what is that telling you who she is?   Does she treat people with kindness, is she helpful or does she display signs of prejudice, even if subtle?  Your value system is something you cannot compomise - so continue to monitor her actions and words to determine what her moral tendencies are.
Sweet - I am looking into getting a few myself - how long did it take for you to get them?  I live in the US so was just wondering.   My biggest problem is deciding what design to get but yours looks amazing
Confirmed.
That hits home - I almost brought something from him a while back
96 keys (1800 layout with numpad and arrows); gun metal aluminum case with no RBG lighting; floating cherry mx blue keys with gmk carbon with sky dolch mixed in
Just got the sample kit in the mail today.  So far the gateron blues are my favorite -  yep, still staying with the clicky switches
You have my dream board!  That looks sweet.  What keyset do you have on it?
Awesome! \n\nGlad I could help :)
First of all, congratulations on starting your own business.  That takes a lot of courage.   One of the key factors in a relationship is having a shared vision.    Right now your boyfriend is not on the same page with your regarding your business.      That is a huge red flag.   As we get older, our visions, dreams, interests and values tend to change.   When you are in a relationship, you want to be with someone who is more or less on the same path that you are in terms of where you want to go in life and more importantly, who you want to be.       Businesses take a lot of time and energy.   This is a great opportunity for him to bond and show his support for you.  If he is unable to do that, then it might be time for you to move on.    You definitely need to have a serious conversation about this with him.  Let me know that the business is a dream of yours and that you need his support.   If he does not take you seriously or blows you off - then that will be a sign of what you need to do.
I have a vortex core and I don't have that on my keyboard.  Can you send us a picture?  Sounds like you might need to RMA it back
I've used cherry mx blues for the longest time but recently tried some gateron blues.  OMG - those felt so good.    I would recommend them over the MX blues but I would recommend getting a sampler kit to try them out - maybe one with a bunch of different blues.  You can get a kit from Novelkeys.xyz to try them out.
Thanks for the input - definitely leaning towards the tada68.   If I can get one with an aluminum case I'll be golden
I take it that you are young given your boyfriend is only 21.   You can do so much better than this.    There is a whole world of men out there that will treat you with kindness, respect, and value who you are.  Your boyfriend does not love you.    Love is not anger.  Love is not abuse.  Love is not punching someone or mentally attacking you.    Nothing good will come out of this relationship.    I know that there is still an emotional attachment to this person but you have to think about yourself and more importantly, protect yourself.    No gentlemen, no matter what he is going through, would ever lay a hand on you.     This is a dangerous road you are on.    Get out as fast as you can and don't even give him a chance to come back into your life.    
Thanks to this thread I just ordered a 25 novelkey sample kit.  I've only used cherry mx blues so I can't wait to test out the other switches
PMing
Can someone walk me through on how to switch my FN and PN keys?  According to the manual you hold FN or PN+L_Shift for 3 seconds and then select the new key.  I've been trying to do that for the last 30 mins with no success.  Thanks
Looking forward to this.  
Good posting by everyone.   I use to wonder the same when I first got into keyboards.    Once I started buying a few sets, people were often surprise at how much my keycaps costs and had a hard time understanding.  I even had a few folks tell me that they thought I had gotten my keyboard at a thrift shop (boy were they shocked when I told them the $$$).   But given that popular keysets are limited in supply plus all the work that goes into producing these, it really does make sense how much they cost.   I wish they were cheaper but if they were then our keyboards wouldn't be that unique either.\n\n
Confirmed
OMG - that is what my co-workers tell me all the time.  Glad I'm not the only one.  I'm sure they are shocked when they find out how much you paid
I once had a boss that demonstrated similar tendencies towards anger.   Everyone tolerated him but one day he lashed out at me for something idiotic.    That same day, I spoke to him in private and told him how he treated me was disrespectful and unprofessional - that I expect him to never treat me like that again.  He was taken back a bit but did apologize.  He never disrespected me again (although he continued his behavior with others).   Use this as a life lesson to speak up for yourself as it is a skill that you will need throughout your life.  If he continues to act out, then bring it up to the department head.  The reason bad behavior exists is because we tend to tolerate it instead of holding people accountable for the actions.  Professor or not, everyone deserves to be treated with respect.\n\n
You need to get out of this relationship.   He does not value who you and nothing you do is going to cause him to change his behavior.   He is already saying rude things to you and once you factor in the drugs, that has to be deal breaker.    
My first mechanical keyboard was a ducky and I could not be happier with the purchase.   I like the fact that I can control lighting without the need of software and everything about the build just feels like quality.  That said, this is mainly going to come down to preference.  I would pay as close attention to the simplest details as oftentimes we don't think about a feature or attribute until after the purchase has been made.   
Good choice.  I started my journey with a ducky shine 5 and have been very happy with it.  I see you got the black version instead of the navy version - that is awesome as the black version has been hard to get hold of lately. BTW, like you mouse pad\n\n
Congratulations.   That will be the first of many keyboards I'm sure.   MX blues or equivalents - that was my first experience with mechanical switches and have never looked back since.
Confirmed
I too grew up with poor social skills.    However, it is definitely something that you can learn and get better at within time.  For me, a big barrier was overcoming the idea of what people might think of me.  I was so afraid of saying the wrong thing that I never said anything at all.  You have to get to a point where you don't care what other people think of you - that you are happy with who you are.    Getting there, however, is a journey.   Definitely read as many self-help books that you can - that will help you with developing strategies to over this.   Secondly, recognize that you are not alone in this.    Many people have overcome this and I have no doubt that you will too.   
Lol.  I use MX Blues at work but luckily I have an office.  Still, people could hear me type.  It first it was annoying to them but now they fine it therapeutic.   
First of all, you are demonstrating great courage.    It is hard to have boundaries but that is exactly what you needed to do.    This is to not only protect yourself but to no longer enable the bad behavior of your boyfriend.   This is not easy but you are doing the right thing.   If you have any hope of saving your boyfriend, he must know that drinking is no longer tolerated by you.  You are not punishing him.  You are not being an asshole.  You are standing up for what you deserve - you are loving yourself and you are also loving him by doing so.    There is a book called "Boundaries in Marriage" by Henry Cloud.   I highly recommend that you pick up a copy.       This is tough given your long history but you will make it through.    You are stronger than you think.   
Thanks for the post.  I'm fairly new to reddit and to mechanical keyboards in general, so I can see how the enthusiasm to get a product might cause us to forget sometimes that fraudsters still exist 
I thought there was talk of one but not 100% certain.  Austin would definitely attract a good crowd.
I absolutely love my orbweaver.  I have an older non-chroma version with their orange silent switches.  For the most part I use it to play games such as Witcher 3 or Skyrim.  I find the the layout to be optimal for those type of games.  Apart from that I don't use it for anything else.  I've had mine for a few years now with no issues.  Highly recommended.
You are relatively young and that leads me to believe that you are in still in process of finding yourself.    This in and of itself is a lifetime journey - one that is nice to discover with a supporting partner.   In this situation, the discovery of sexual preferences is one that you are going to have to make on your own.   Seldom is sex meaningless (although it can be at times).   I like that you are being honest with your boyfriend but it doesn't sound like he is being completely transparent with his feelings.     I do think you need to explore this option as you need to find who you are in this aspect of your life.     Just be prepared as this is going to potentially put your relationship at risk.    
I think a lot of people can relate to what you are going through.   All of us have a need to love and to be loved.    When we are growing up, if we have healthy relationships with our family, particularly with our fathers - then we tend to develop a strong sense of self-worth.   When those things are absent or less than ideal, then there is a tendency to question if we are even deserving of love.  You mentioned that your relationships with your father, brother and step-father were complicated.   That leads me to think that you wanted more out of your relationships at home and didn't get it.   And yet, no matter how much you want love - feeling unloved is something that you are accustomed too.   It is sort of a paradox but it seems like deep down you are afraid to have love as perhaps it challenges a core belief of yours that you are not worthy.  After all, your upbringing told you that so it must be true type of thing.   So when you are seeking men who are unavailable, you are simply navigating towards that which makes you comfortable.    I hope I'm not going too far on the deep in.  I could very well be way off track.   Regardless,  to my initial point - all humans have a fundamental need to love and be loved.     If you want to receive the love you deserve, then you must demonstrate the love that you never received to a world that is in desperate need of it.    It also means that you have been given time to focus on you.    That is something that is not to be taken for granted.    What are your interests, hobbies and likings?   This is your opportunity to enjoy life, to discover who you are and to do those things that are oftentimes hard to do once you are in a committed relationship.    Ironically, by focusing on yourself (even being a little selfish with your needs and interests) - that will make you more attractive because you have to become whole first before Mr. Right will show up.   The most important thing right now is for you to work on getting to a place where you believe that you are valuable and worthy.   Once you get to that point, you will no longer have the need to manipulate men or find unavailable men attractive.   
Unfortunately he sounds a little immature.   After having sex with you he decides to go play video games instead of laying down next to you when you clearly were giving me hints that you wanted him to stay - really?   What I will say is this, you are young and right now this guy might seem like the greatest thing to you, but he isn't.   There will be more men you will come across that will have more of the qualities that you are looking for.  I'm not saying to cut ties with this guy but rather to use the situation to discover what you are looking for in guy so that you can fine-tune your expectations (that is to say know what you want and not settle for less).   
Thanks - that was it.  I was trying to do that on L0.  I will try that when I get home today

I am so looking forward to this meet up.  This will be my first "keyboard event."   My wife thought I was crazy when I told her about it but then I showed her some pictures from some other meet ups and she was like, "well, you better bring some cash just in case I find something I like."   If she gets on the MK craz then we will be one broke family.   \n\n
Thanks for the good rundown on options.    I never really appreciated programming keyboards until I got my Vortex Core.  So do all these options let me assign multiple key strokes to one key?

So it sounds like your girlfriend has some serious insecurities.    Those either result from something in her past or something you are currently doing that is causing her to doubt the relationship.  Either way, you two have been dating for six months and if she is starting to go through your stuff this early in the game, more likely than not the relationship is probably not going to work.   Without a trust in a relationship there is nothing for you two to stand on.   It is better for you to find this out now rather than to be dating for years to only realize that she was not the right person for you .   Best of luck to you.
That's crazy - maybe because I am in the US.  Who knows.  As far as finding keycaps - I'm still fairly new but I would check out geekhack.org as that forum has a lot of good info. The r/mechmarket is also a good place to buy sets or at least get a feel for what you might like.  I'm still trying to get a sense of what my tastes really are and unfortunately I think that is going to take time - at least until I spend a little more time looking at how other people design/customize their keyboards.   Let me know how you like the ducky shine 6 software.  Overall, Ducky is good brand - been very happy with mine.\n  
Perfect - I appreciate all the help
I'm sorry to tell you this but the other commenters are right.  You need to get rid of this guy asap.   He is no good for you.    He cheated on you three weeks into the relationship - that is a major red flag.  It is also a red flag that you decided to stay with him.    A person with a high self-worth will not tolerated bullshit like that.   Don't fall for the excuses or lies he gives you.    Recognize your value and don't wait time with this dude.
Confirmed. 
Awesome.  This is on my essential mod list.  Glad it is now on SE.
So putting aside her opinions, how is the relationship going overall?    Does she go out of her way to do nice things and show her appreciation towards you?   Some people are frankly not able to hold an intelligent conversation without saying irrational things.  Those same people might otherwise be kind and friendly, just not the type to have those types of discussions with.    If you are the type that enjoys talking about politics and the issues of society, then this relationship probably will not work out.   I think you have to assess the overall quality of the relationship to see if it good or not.   A year and half of dating is still a relatively short time, so you are still getting to know each other and determine if this is just a phase or more of a long-term type of thing\n
Bargain shopping is definitely the way to go (if I can only follow my own advice).    PCs have really advanced over the years.  I build my PC four years ago using an Intel sandy bridge processor and it still can handle anything I throw at it.   Keep us posted on your build.       
So I tried to purchase the TADA68 last night on AliExpress and I got a message that the payment was unsuccessful.  The error code is "IPAY_RS_7029".   Has anybody gotten that message before?    I tired ordering it on my ipad - so maybe I'll try again on my PC.   Glad to hear that Originative might be selling them soon.    I think I am convinced that the TADA68 is what I want to get at this point.

Any good shops that are based in Singapore or ships from Singapore? And should I choose vcanz or gensace lipos? 
I narrowed down to ducky 2108 s2 or ikbc c104. Both are same price for taobao and are within my price range. Any suggestions or recommendations for similar budget and shipped to Singapore? 
In normal usage, your motors won't pull that many amps. I suggest going with racerstar rs30a v2 from banggood for your escs. \n\nI would not get the 9x. I suggest the turnigy evolution. It is much newer product and is good for multirotors. \n\nThe batteries should be okay if you are not planning to mount a action cam. If not u would not have enough space. 
You are using uart 2 right now. So enable serial rx there instead. \n\nAnd the connection on the x4r maybe wrong? It may have to be on the bottom pins instead. I've never used one so correct me pls.

I feel like I might have over complicated my order due to misunderstanding his instructions; whoops lol. But I feel like it would have warranted a reply or re-order if they were overly complicated. I'll try to get in contact with him.

You could always partition and dual boot Windows 10 via Bootcamp. I had no issues when I was running this configuration on my 15" 2015 rMBP. \n\nWere I you, I'd definitely look at the [refurbished section](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/macbook_pro) of Apple's website - you'll be able to get one of the older, more "port friendly" models and save a few bucks as well.
Which titles have been ambiguous? The titles of all seven saga films have been rather on-the-nose summations of the film's plot.\n\n*The Phantom Menace* - an obvious reference to the return of the Sith; Sidious and Maul are enemies of the Jedi working in the shadows until Maul attacks Qui-Gon on Tatooine. \n\n*Attack of the Clones* - the climax of the film is a massive battle featuring (you guessed it) clones.\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* - Palpatine successfully gains a new, more powerful apprentice, exterminates the Jedi Order and assumes control (albeit temporarily) of the galaxy. \n\n*A New Hope* - a new force user emerges, and the Rebel Alliance brings hope to the galaxy by destroying the Death Star.\n\n*The Empire Strikes Back* - two hours of "watch the three heroes from the last movie get their asses kicked by the bad guys!"\n\n*Return of the Jedi* - could either be referring to Luke completing his training or the fact that Anakin is redeemed in the end; either way, this is the only film of the saga that has a title that could be argued as having a level of ambiguity at this point.\n\n*The Force Awakens* - The force has been largely dormant since Luke's self-imposed exile. It "awakens" with Rey.
What I remember of my thought process after getting my Type-S:\n\nDay one: "Why the fuck did I just spend $340 on a keyboard? This layout is weird."\n\nDay two: "I guess having a control key there is handy for when I use Vim..."\n\nDay three: "I never want to own a keyboard without a split backspace layout ever again."\n\nDay four (the first day I forgot my HHKB at home and went back to Cherry Clears): "Good god MX switches feel awfully scratchy. There's no 'bump' compared to Topre. I'm selling all of my other keyboards. HHKB is all I need."\n\nAfter two years with my HHKB, I actively dislike stock tactile MX switches. \n\nLubed Gat Browns, which are on my WhiteFox, are usable but they just don't feel as good. I think a spring swap might be in order soon. My Anne Pro's linear switches are okay (I really need to desolder/lube then before I form a real opinion). \n\nMy HHKB was *it* for me. The layout makes sense, I love the sound, and 45g Topre is ludicrously comfortable for me. I don't really care that much about keycap customization (the stock caps are still among the best I've ever felt) beyond a few colored blanks for the arrow cluster. I just love that little hunk of beige plastic. \n\n
Confirmed
Honestly if you're doing that much repetitive hand motion, throwing heavier springs in the mix probably won't do anything beyond increasing your likelihood for developing an RSI. \n\nSeveral boards probably have dual USB ports (my HHKB does, and I severely doubt that it's unique in that regard) but you may find difficulty using both ports in some applications because of power constraints with USB.\n\nEdit: spelling is hard, guys.

Yeah, my EU knowledge was wholly encompassed by Timothy Zahn's books, the Rogue Squadron series, and Stackpole's *I, Jedi*.\n\nI've gone back and read some more of it since discovering a huge stash of EU novels at my local secondhand bookstore, but the hit to shit ratio is quite skewed...
First was a WASD CODE 104 with MX Clears. \n\nAfter that, I wanted to try something smaller; I saw a picture of an HHKB and fell in love. Picked up a Type-S on /r/MechMarket. \n\nAround a year or so later, I decided I wanted to try MX again, so I got a WhiteFox from the second drop. It was my first build and it's my current daily driver. This really sparked my interest in building keyboards, and now I'm honestly more interested in building keyboards than acquiring more keyboards (if that makes sense at all). \n\nI traded into an Anne Pro on MM after buying blanks for my HHKB last month. \n\nAt this point, I really think I'm over MX and I'm going to go back to Topre for my daily driver. I'm a few artisans shy of "finishing" my HHKB. After that, I'd like to get a Japanese Type-S, put HiPro caps on it, and call it a day. I'll keep my WhiteFox (sentimental attachment to my first build and all) but I'll probably trade the CODE and Anne Pro. Might grab a kit from time to time, build it, and sell it after a month or so, but once I've got those HHKBs I'll be content.

Forest Village is marketed as a "student" property, but I've lived there long since graduating (currently saving for a wedding and a house and didn't feel like moving again) and aside from the potholes in the parking lot I don't really have any complaints.\n\nThe buildings are older, but not run down, and it was one of the more affordable, pet-friendly places in town that I found that had in-unit washer/dryer hookups. The office and maintenance staff are nice and pretty quick to respond when I have questions. There's also a shuttle to campus if you're interested in that.\n\nMy unit rents for $720/month (including the pet fee on the largest floorplan), but no utilities are bundled. \n\nEdit: utilities are all through the city, and my bill is roundabout $120/month for water, sewer, electric, and trash. Also, literally a one minute drive to the Reactor Field lot - you could cheap out for a parking pass there and then catch the shuttle to campus if you don't want to deal with the property's community shuttle.

Sold blue Topre PBT spacebar to /u/chipdiggler 
GMK sets are generally great about supporting multiple layouts. \n\nEdit: most other kits that go through group buys (SA, DSA, etc) will usually have add-on kits to add compatibility with esoteric layouts as well. 
Some are popping up in the shop now (VGG, Pink/Blue, Black/Orange, Macaron Blue & Pink), but not the colorway I need :(
I was in the same boat...I finally just said "Fuck it" and picked one up on /r/MechMarket.\n\nThe good thing is they tend to hold resale value quite well so when you buy one, if you don't like it you'll have an easy time recouping most of your cost.
This is probably going to sound way saltier than I meant it to, OP, but...I really like the general idea of this keyset, it's just poorly executed in its current state.\n\nYou can't just take three out of the 16 colors in the Solarized palette and then call it a Solarized Dark keyset, IMO. It's unfair to the insane amount of work Ethan put in while making this palette.
I'd like to get one with the integrated wrist rest, but I know the screw holes on an Anne Pro aren't the standard 60% placement - has anyone tried a Royal Glam case on their Anne Pro?
Well then...good luck with your search :) \n\nApologies, I assumed this was the standard "WebMD told me so!" routine.\n\nBeyond the "Topre makes my hands less tired than MX" anecdote, I've little to offer.
I know it's highly unlikely, but I'd love to see (even if it's one night only) the theatrical cut of Star Wars in theaters. 
Really enjoyed this as a quick list of what's been reintroduced from Legends canon. \n\nWas there anything glaringly obvious that they missed?
Sounds like a piece of debris may have lodged inside the switch or between the PCB and plate. If said debris were conductive, it could be causing the switch to misfire. \n\nOr, your board is yet another example of Razer's shit QC and it's a defective switch. 
Here's where I was [a few months ago](https://imgur.com/a/dBJGf); I've since added some [blanks](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5olqpk/one_step_closer_to_endgame/) and three-fourths of a Gray Wolf arrow cluster. 
OT lightsaber blades were quite thin. 
Price is per keycap.
It was in one of the "interludes" of the second Aftermath book, IIRC.
...that's because I mistyped that command :/\n\nTry this when you get to step 7:\n\n`dfu-util -D ./WhiteFox/kiibohd.dfu.bin`\n\nEdit: if that doesn't work, `cd WhiteFox` and `dfu-util kiibohd.dfu.bin`
IIRC it was something like 100 on base, 50 on compatibility. 
This series and Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy are my favorite books from Legends canon.

Call me plain, but 45g Topre is *it* for me. I love it. The feel, the sound, I just love it all. \n\nMy current HHKB is close...white Type-S with blanks. I need to source a few more HKP Gray Wolf blanks (Ctrl key and two more R1 keys for the Fn key and to complete the arrow cluster), and Warmaster for the Esc. I've got one of shadovved's metal sticker sets on order, and I'll probably pair it with one of /u/Winnja's coiled LightCycle cables (I custom ordered a Micro USB one for my WhiteFox and I love it). I'll probably duplicate this board so that I'll have matching boards work and in my home office.\n\nEventually, maybe a JP Type-S with HiPro keycaps...but that's a pipe dream right now. I'll have to settle with lusting after /u/chucklingkumquat's [gorgeous JP boards](http://imgur.com/gallery/CjYQx) for now.\n\nEdit: clarifying wording.
I've been getting a ton of "Sleep Wake" errors that lead to full system crashes lately on both my 2015 15" rMBP and my 2010 27" iMac.

Without knowing what error messages you got (and what commands you were getting them from), it's going to be very, very difficult to offer any insight with this.\n\nThese are the exact steps I took on macOS Sierra to flash my WhiteFox (apologies, I don't have my keyboard at home so I don't exactly remember if/when you'll need to run commands with `sudo` privileges):\n\n1. Configure your layout on InputClub's website and download it.\n2. Open up Terminal.app (Should be at `Finder > Utilities > Terminal.app`)\n3. Type `brew install dfu-util` and press enter. If you're told something about needing `sudo` privileges to run the command, type `sudo !!`, press enter, and then type in your admin account password - you won't see any characters popping up (this is default *nix behavior) - and press enter.\n4. Type `cd Downloads` (or whatever directory your browser downloads files to), press enter.\n5. Press the firmware update button on the bottom of your keyboard (there should be an orange LED indicating that it's in update mode). \n6. Open up your `Downloads` folder (or whatever folder your browser downloads files in) in Finder and find the name of your `.dfu.bin` file - you'll need that next.\n7. Type `dfu-util -D <name of file from step 6>.dfu.bin`, press enter. Again, if you're prompted for `sudo` permissions, run `sudo !!` and enter your password.\n\nIf you've done all of this correctly, the orange LED should turn off, meaning that your firmware has successfully flashed. \n\nIf you have any issues, feel free to reply here or PM me with the error messages you're receiving and I'll try to offer any insight that I can.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: helps if you actually list the right command in step 7, heh.
Honestly, if you're just going to put Windows on it (which is the vibe I'm getting from your post) you may want to consider a Razer Blade 14. \n\nThey've ripped off the last gen MacBook Pro's design (so blatantly that I'm surprised Apple never filed suit) and its generally praised by members of the YouTube tech crowd that aren't Apple users.

...except that it *is* definitively plural, as multiple foreign translations (specifically French, German, and Spanish) of the teaser poster released through official channels have shown.\n\n
TL;DR - proper posture and streching will (anecdotally) make a bigger difference than switch weight.\n-------\n\nI don't have arthritis, but I'm the early stages of carpal tunnel syndrome. My pinkies and ring fingers tingle and completely go numb from time to time, and specific areas of my wrist and forearm ache occasionally. I'm a software engineer by trade, so not typing just isn't an option for me.\n\nStep one, talk to your doctor. Full stop. Do not solely rely on random internet people's advice. \n\nThat said, after consulting my primary doctor and an orthopedic surgeon, changing my hand posture and doing proper stretches with my hands/fingers before, during, and after work are the most impactful things I've done. \n\nAs far as posture goes, keep your wrists straight. Don't rest them on a pad. I don't even use a wrist rest anymore because it tempts me to be lazy with my posture. I've also switched to using a sit/stand desk at work - this has made maintaining proper typing posture a lot easier for me.\n\nI've experimented with changing to a lighter switch - my first mech had MX Clears; I've since switched to Gat Browns and 45g Topre - and after a full workday (roundabout 12 hours on a bad day, closer to ten normally), the difference is negligible to me. \n\nInterestingly enough, I've found Topre (despite being a similar weight) to be much less fatiguing than MX-type switches when I'm on a huge deadline crunch and I'm frequently pulling longer workdays. \n\nAgain: your mileage may vary; talk to a doctor and take what this random internet stranger is telling you with a grain of salt.

Okay - that means you don't have Homebrew installed. \n\nYou'll just need to go back in to Terminal.app and run the following:\n`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`\n\nEdit: [here's the link for Homebrew's website](https://brew.sh) with more instructions / explanation.

Adopting my cat was really helpful to me when I was still living alone - having someone waiting for me when I came home from work every day did wonders for my mental health.\n\nHe's relatively low-maintenance - food twice a day, fresh water every other day, and scoop the litter box a couple times a week.
I haven't fully abandoned running wireless yet, but this is another thing I'll have to take under consideration. Shouldn't be that hard to hog out a battery slot with some small tools.
The [Realforce RGB](https://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rf104&pid=aeax0100) has some media controls, but I'm not sure about the rest. \n\nAFAIK, the HHKB is the only Topre board that has a built-in USB hub, but it's 2.0; I'm honestly not even sure if a keyboard exists with USB-C built-in at this point, regardless of switch type.\n\nEdit: honestly, depending on your OS, you could probably just program a keyboard shortcut to launch whatever calculator program you'd like to have opened.

Drouin+Filpulla+Boyle makes very little sense as a line.  Filpulla and Drouin are both passers and playmakers more than anything and Boyle is not a finisher.  Drouin should've been with Kucherov from day 1 once Stammer got injured.\n\nHedman is in consideration for the Norris so I wouldn't say he's having an off year.  What he needs is some defensive depth behind him that allows him and Stralman to play together rather than being paired with Sustr or Dotchin every other night.\n\nI think Kucherov is just discouraged like a lot of other guys are.  He has his moment when games are close but once they fall behind by two or three goals he seems to just disappear.\n\nAll in all I think that the injury parade and the constant call ups made it difficult to keep the lines the same from night to night but I think that by this point Cooper should've been able to figure out a Top 6 at least but still the lines change every night with no sign of stopping.  \n\nDraft lottery here we come!
This deal is a good as Doan...
My only thought is that Boyle is a UFA at the end of this season and his wife is a Florida native.  When he came here in the first place he stated that the decision to come to Tampa was heavily influenced by the fact that his wife had family in the area.

Overage college players always seem to do very well.  Guys take an extra year or two in juniors before heading to school and show up on campus more developed and more mature. They usually come out the other side being well rounded players with good discipline.  Hope this ends up being the case for Ross.
Let me rephrase.  I can logistically wrap my head around but I can't do so emotionally.  I grew up watching Bishop and UMaine hockey and I'm sad to the only Black Bear left on the team head elsewhere.

Well your goaltending is struggling and our defense is struggling.  Do you really think that Armstrong and Yzerman haven't tossed the idea around? They've had a couple meetings and are good friends plus there have been reports of Blues scouts at Bolts games and vice versa. It's not the dumbest trade speculation I've ever heard.

Woah. That seems pretty healthy.  Without saying what store or city could you give us any indication of what the population of your general area is?
I know.  We're not looking for rental defensmen either at this point and Yzerman is of the same mindset so it's like 95% not going to happen.  I was just trying to point out the reasons that people won't shut up about that trade is all.
I'm in Portland too!  You've given me so much hope! When did you call and how'd you get them to give you the numbers?!
Oh yeah! I forgot about Jones! Maybe I'll just withdraw my previous offer.

I'm completely fine with this for the 5Mil it gives us to resign guys in the off season.
I should add, our office is fairly noisy. Lots of people shouting back and forth across the office, people on the phone, etc... Most of the complaints he gets are mostly us messing with him but whenever he gets a real one management just tells him not to worry about.
As a Maine native, I love Kariya as much if not more than the next guy but he was never going to be on this list. If he had won a cup with the Ducks and broke. 1000 games/points there'd be a better argument to be made. \n\nNow if this was a list of guys who got clocked by Scott Stevens and then scored one of the most memorable goals in playoff history, he's be #1 without a doubt!
What would it take to make a deal involving Parayko for Johnson or is Parayko untouchable?
When I was playing in high school there were a lot of parents of my teammates who would yell at refs and coaches and other players.  After one game where the officiating was particularly questionable my mom mentioned how bad she wanted to join in and yell at those refs but didn't do it because she knew I'd be embarrassed.  I was a pretty lucky kid.

I've been wanting something like this, too. The most recent thing I can think of is the Z70 that was on Massdrop, which was a 65% with split space. I would have gotten it had the spacebars been placed in a more comfortable position. Hopefully, we see new boards/PCBs with this option in the near future.

make it ortho and it'll be perfect\n
Normally only one function layer on a 60%, so why the raise and lower?
I've made a similar layout with regards to the shifted second row and arrow cluster; I like the idea of using two 1u keys on LShift for keyset compatibility, but I'd probably have to have both keys assigned to Shift anyways, one for alphas, one for Ctrl-Shift-Tabbing and such.\n\nEDIT: Also, I believe numpad 0 is a row 1 2u that would fit the description for left shift in this layout, apart from color/legends.\n\nhttp://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/5256c06cdd7e2f3e4f4fab730395ff03
Yeah, unfortunately the 2u left shift would be ideal but isn't usually available unless you steal the 0 key or the split has a planck spacebar. I've heard people say that the even staggering is better, I figure it's a good balance between standard and ortholinear. I'll have to check those out!\n
The position of the spacebars is a little iffy for me. I rest my thumb below the J, so it would be difficult to use it.
You're 100% correct, the XD60 has a lot of the things I'm looking for. However, I'm also trying to make a layout with evenly staggered rows, the only keyboard I know of that does that is the Filco Minila Air, which has some keycap compatability issues and no split space. But yes, if one were to make a couple compromises in any area, a similar layout would be achievable in many different ways.
Is very close to Banana Split. https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=84891.0
Hey, I actually like that idea very much
Seems we're thinking along the same lines, and yep you're right about the 0 key, my thoughts exactly.
I don't think I could handle how offset the space and enter/backspace are on the bottom row. It gives me OCD feelings that I didn't know I had. It's a clever design though! Keep up the good work!
The XD60 has that too iirc. I've considered it for that very same purpose a couple of times myself. If you are lucky enough (like me) to get yourself two [Cherry G80-11900's](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_G80-11900) you can get two 2u shift keys. I'm building [this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/5d7340568f359a15efd07e9b9de1c221) with mine! Complete with OG doubleshots
I had a similar idea with the Subatomic (5x14), I'll have to drag that up.
That's better, as long as I can reprogram it to not have arrows there. Arrows are completely unnecessary with the HHKB layout imo, it's more comfortable than having dedicated arrows.\n\nEdit: I'd rather have a completely symmetrical bottom row to be honest. Lengthen the right spacebar and put an alt and a code to the right of it and we're golden!
Hmm... maybe even set the left one to output Ctrl+Shift to save a keystroke?
I'd much prefer it without the arrow keys and with the up and the button next to it merged into a regular shift. :)\n\nOkay, I'll admit it, I just want an HHKB with a split space.. Please, someone?
What about an HHKB with split space and arrows? Check it out:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/E7SzV
Mainly to have the options, its half for keyset compatibility though. I'd probably start with 2 Fn keys and 2 space bars that do the same thing, and change if I found a use for them, but it will make it easier to find standard keycap sizes.
wow I like it
XD60 and upcoming banana split are very similar, but the interesting thing with this one is you don't lose the slash/question mark key.. but you sacrifice shift key size and the last staggered row is misaligned. I dig it though.
Thoughts on the layout? I tried to make it compatible with most GMK sets, with a little tweaking, so no 2u Shift or 3u Space.
So you didn't get the stabs working with the 1up sliders?
That's such a nice comment, thanks for the confidence boost, the low up vote count had me down there for a bit.
Just get used to the arrows on the regular one and you won't want arrow keys anymore.
You could just wait a couple of hours for pictures of it to come up on Facebook? :)

Is there a guide on how to get the topre to mx stems to work on the stabilizer keys? I have converters on the way but I've read that this is a problem.

Yes, that's obviously the case and I'm not at all trying to bash OP, I think it looks fine. It's just that I don't understand what is upvoted and what's not.
Sorry, I built it myself.
I would suggest maybe half of these. Not more. :)
The keys are just as big as on a full sized keyboard, the placement is exactly the same as well. I just don't have dedicated arrows, a numpad and an f1-f12 row, pretty much standard 60%. 
I mean, this is our home, we have a studio apartment so I'm sharing the apartment with my girlfriend, we just happen to have our books above the desk because we decided that it was a good place to have it. :) The books that aren't fiction are mostly hers.

Read the description.
"If you struggled with no arrows on poker you're likely to fight with the hhkb pro 2"\nI don't agree with this. The arrows in the hhkb is just way better laid out so for me, who couldn't get used to the poker, it only took a day to get so used to the hhkb arrows that I'm never going dedicated arrow keys again. But that's just my experience. The fn+arrows being reachable with one hand without strain makes a hell of a difference in comfort because then you can still use your left hand for modifiers like you're used to with dedicated arrows.
I have tons of custom bindings and gestures on it, it's great.
Moist = good.
I don't have any RGB's. Are you saying I should post again with a different title? ;)
It's perfect where it is on the HHKB, no one says you can't have ANOTHER fn-layer next to the spacebar.
Hey did you sell the JD45?\nI see no price. Is it without switches?
Try them first. I love them but don't make that kind of investment blindly. They need a decent app as well, I use the chord mojo and it's fine.

Where is the right pinky fn?? You barbarian!
Unfortunate, it's what I love most about my HHKB, the placement of FN in relation to the arrows, it's just so much more easily accessible than a dedicated arrow cluster. Still dreaming of a programmable HHKB with a split space. I want to put an fn-key on the right side of the split spacebar.

Love my VB87M, but only one thing I would like to be able to program. Then it would be perfect.
I shipped few things to Europe and it seems there is a flat fee for 31.95 for items under 4lbs (< 2kg)
How did you get the stabilizer inserts to stick? Mine kept falling out from the keys.
I generally do 100g linears for escape, delete and space bar. And greens for alphas.
I just want the two keys with guitar head images :-(
Here in SF Bay Area, friend of a friend had bunch in the garage and he wanted those out.
Yes this is it. I like it so far, I picked it from /r/mechmarket, you can see the Q is little mess up but I cannot order just one cap. :(
What keys are you looking for?
USB-C please for the center connector.
VA68M with /u/ca178858 PCB and plate. SIP Socketed MX Greens, blank PBT with Cherry Profile\n\nTADA68/aluminum case,  MX Greens\n\nInfinity60% with 3Run Standard layout with MX Greens\n\nBuilt the Infinity and VA68 this weekend.
Sold Royal Navy to /u/Elektryk
Only mini keyboards are allowed?
Gateron Green, with spring swapped for SpaceBar, and ESC to 150g and modifiers to 98g, alphas regular 80g\n
Confirmed
Clueboard, only missing two keys compared to MagicForce68.
PMd
A big yes please.
If the keycap designers would include Command key along with Win key it would help a long way. Specially icon mods
Am a Mac user, if you are on sierra then I would recommend a programable keyboard.\n\nCurrently there is no support for multi key press in Karabiner Elements.\n\nI am waiting for K-Type, currently own TADA68 and it works really well.
It would be nice if the case was compatible with Phantom PCB. Someone needs to buy it and dissemble it.
I do like the Greens. Been a long time user of the Blues but now the blues seems too light.
No problem, be glad to help.
I have a MF68 / Cherry Greens, Silver backlit with dip switches.
Yeah I agree most of them are rubber domes. I just wanted the Apple ones, but they came as a package.
Yes the PCB is not split, but I like the 2.75 shift for space bar.

Its TADA68 from https://www.originativeco.com/products/tada68
Would love to do that. Anyone known if teensy 2 is compatible with this?
QFR-i TKL with Blues?
Edited the post! Thanks for pointing it out.
Alps TKL PCB with TMK support.
Came to say this! 99% white
Are these the ones you are looking for?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/NNWFBQR\n
Case looks really nice. A real competitor to Whitefox.\n\nI think splitting the space bar into three would be better. 2.25 + 1.25 + 2.75. Left Shift + Mod + Right Shift size.\n
This is probably a better way to go.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L7lEDS6xj5w
QFR-i TKL with Blues?
I tired few times and it did not solve the problem. I gave up, will try again tomorrow and see if I can reset it. 
Bought a LFK78 PCB, and Case from /u/ca178858
Yes, the K-Type is really nice. I think lots of folks are waiting for it. Yes, I can program TADA68 using the mac. You just have to do it using the command line once you have the FLASH.bin file. If you do it from the Finder it will create .DS* file which will cause problems for the cpu.
How about 68% VA68M/MagicForce?
Looks awesome.
Pm'ed
Is the case compatible with any programable PCBs? Phantom? Winkeyless?
You are welcome!
I have new Matias Clicky switches, but I am in California so not sure how much shipping is going to be. 
Coffee, don't like the smell of it.
If you really want a TKL now, you can get the kit from Keyclack https://www.keyclack.com/product/sandwich-kb. They have some left over 87s from the group buy.
When can I order the board or two?
DSA Royal Navy
Actually /u/ca178858 did the hard work of designing the PCB, you can pick it from him if you like. You can get the info from https://github.com/mechkeys/mechkeys/tree/master/LFK78
It's been a week for me. So let's see how long it takes.
Sold Wolf Mark to /u/Rew2132
Yes, I like those over the Cherry Greens. In my opinion they are more crisp.
Anyone tried it with Satan or Infinity PCB?
If you like 60% then I would recommend Hasu's ALPS64 with AEK plate. 
Yes, I am in the east bay San Ramon/Danville area.
Would you like it have it?
Looks very similar to Banana Split https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=84891.0\n\nMaybe collaborate with them so that keycaps can be compatible.
Apple Magic Mouse for all the gestures.
I don't want split it. Only if someone else buys the other stuff.
I already have a AEK alu plate from lasergist coming will let you know how it works.\n\nGot the CAD files from hasu and also have an AEK as a donor for switches and caps.
I have sent an email to Massdrop. Probably will not get an answer until about next week.
Yeah those are the default blank keys that came with TADA68.
I am asking 80 + Shipping.
Confirmed
Is the phantom pcb compatible with QFR-I case and plate?
I like the layout, it has arrow keys that help. I have mapped the vi arrow keys to HJKL so I tend not use the arrow keys much they come in handy some times.\n\nI don't have a 60% so I cannot comment on that aspect.\nCaps Lock == Fn\nBottom Row\n[Control][Option][Command][Spacebar][Command][Option][Control][Left][Down][Right]
Apple MagicMouse
Well typically you press Cmd-Shift-3 to take a screen shot. You are pressing 3 keys together. There are other multi-key combinations. Karabinar disables all of those. So you if wanted to map something like Control-H for left you cannot do the, Only simple swaping of the keys.

Thanks for the info. Just wanted to make sure the loader did not change. Also do you just rename the hex file to FLASH.bin?
I think it is, but was not sure. What ever the AEK had.
Apple Extended Keyboard (not AEK II).
I am surprises no one said Mary Magdalene
Slower traffic keep right.
That would make a great guitar body. Not sure how /r/luthier feels about this.
Yeah I still have them. I don't mind shipping to Germany, but it will end up costing you lots of money. If you are ok with that. 
I will be in for one PCB for Cherry switches.
/u/ca178858 is working on the PCB that will fit VA68M.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5eulpe/plates_arrived_for_new_custom_alps_aek_in_va68m/?st=iw488und&sh=0396f62c
I will take one with cherry stabilizers.
I don't know what gave you that idea? Yes, I am the author of the books. Have Swift questions?
What are you using to rest your desoldering iron on?
sold to /u/tactiphile
1 Yes\n2 TKL\n3 not necessary 
Fairly sure the springs are the same, but the browns will have a higher peak force and work to actuation because of the weight of the tactile bump.
Holy shit
What the hell white keycaps are those that have no light bleed through them?
What in tarnation are those keycaps? They look unnaturally good for a blank white set.
In RGB, both boards come with doubleshot ABS keycaps, so I don't believe there's much difference there. The Pok3r has an aluminum case vs the Pro S's plastic case and is also programmable (though not fully), so I'd give it the edge here personally.
Dang, that's really helpful. Thanks!
Holy mother of god those rainbow dyesubs
eep, Logitech M100 here.\nDon't judge, we have a crap ton of budget mice in our house and this is the most comfortable by far imo.\nI also have a Kensington Orbit w/ Scroll Wheel on my left hand but I use that far less often, truth be told.

Hotswap switches to something nice, potentially change the keycaps.
Topre, yee-haw!
Indeed, 'tis the blue gradient. They had both on that drop iirc.
If you need I can send you the script or even just the compiled exe, just message me.
Could this be any less friendly for us colorblind people?
Interesting. Did you still have to mount the switches sideways and modify the housings?
I think the greatest problem isn't so much the pinky stretch as the fact that it's a diamond cluster, which is not so conducive to pressing down or using diagonals.
Having used one, I've found that it was pretty damn comfy although shit for gaming in my case.
Interesting to note that all the other trackpoint modules I've seen ripped from keyboard have been directly attached to their controllers with a much larger footprint. From what I can see, the Lenovo T440's keyboard might have a matching trackpoint module to this one, but probably doesn't have the controller and USB port built in, which is a shame because the standalone keyboard is expensive as heck.
It's just a different layout and shape. I don't think there's any particular reason you couldn't use it for gaming, although anything requiring function keys or dedicated arrows would be difficult.
I mean, that's just the 660M, right?\nAlthough the 660C comes with its own share of keycap difficulties...
Oh my gosh what have I done\n\nForgive me, ripster, for I have blasphemed against the clack
They're definitely not the first, whatever they might say, since Team Wolf or whatever company it was got there with the Zhuque TKL and the Vod Ray full-size, but it's a great concept and I'm glad to see it being used more. 
From experience, Gateron is generally quite a bit smoother than the other brands. I haven't observed any great differences between the other three brands, although Cherry *may* be slightly more reliable/have better QC than Kailh and Outemu.
Really cool stuff! I wonder if it would be possible to use a breakout board to connect this to a Teensy in a DIY build so you don't need two USB cables.
It should just be `CapsLock::LCtrl`
Check your privilege pls
IIRC, with Emulate3Buttons, left+right click is equivalent to clicking the mouse wheel, whereas the Trackpoint's middle button doesn't provide a middle click, but sends scroll commands based on the direction and amount you push the Trackpoint. \n\nFor example, you don't close tabs with the Trackpoint scroll button, but you can with a middle-click.\n
Different layout than VE.A though.
Nah, all the Team Wolf keyboards I've seen/used have a different set of keycaps with more squarish font and symbols on mods. This one looks like it has something like the Royal Kludge ABS doubleshots.\nAlso their full-size (Vod Ray) has a much fancier/more garish case, whereas this one is a lot more subdued. \nStill, it's way more pricey than either the Zhuque or the Vod Ray and from what I can tell doesn't have RGB like the Vod Ray.
I use an AutoHotKey script on Windows and a one-line startup command on Linux.\n
FYI, I don't know if it's different for the F660C but on my HHKB I solved the problem with spacebar loudness using an o-ring (like I assume you did for the stabilized keys)
Maybe see if you can convince him to floss mod it?\n
wallet too empty for ssk, i cri evertim
Where can you go about getting the dome sheets?
Where'd you mount the trackpoint module? I'm trying to put together a design for a custom with trackpoint; I thought the one from the SpaceSaver II was pretty large and difficult to do this with, but maybe not?
Source of archived links?
The pie chart greatly confused me for a few seconds.\nhttp://imgur.com/LBZ9XWU\n
Interesting stuff! Have you tried putting the invyr panda stems in gateron/cherry housings and vice versa?
I think I followed the lube guide that ripster made, but there are a few places to lube. IIRC I put some on the sides, cylinder thing, and bumps of the slider.
In the Gateron camp there are tactile clears which are basically the same 67g Zealios, sold by winkeyless. 
Pretty sure that just emulates a middle-click, though, which is different from how the middle button usually works with trackpoint setups.
The concern I personally have is that I find that my hands don't actually rest on the home row; with my fingers at natural extension it's more like a-w-e-f-j-i-o-; than a-s-d-f-j-k-l-;. Very interesting concept of only shifting keys vertically though.
I mean, that's the only place to hold it so it can't sting you, really.
Damn son.\nOut of interest, what motherboard insulating rings did you use?
This is pretty easily fixable, it has to do with the combined parity of the centers.\nI don't have the alg off the top of my head but I'll try o remember. PM me if I forget\n\nEDIT: 3x(L' U L' U' L' U' L' U L U L2)
Maybe this guy?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK2cnxXauls&feature=youtu.be
Lubrication does tend to help the springs push the slider back up through the bump. A lot of people use something like a light Krytox mix (usually with PTFE); I think Zeal sells some, and EliteKeyboards sells MechLube. I personally went cheapo and bought a bottle of Super Lube (the 4 oz, high viscosity stuff) and it worked pretty well for all the boards I used it on.
But stock HHKB caps are all PBT except spacebar
Yeah, gmk almost never has a non-uk international kit. Terminal has one with UK, Nordic and German. \n\nI've never seen gmk with Spanish, tho. Plenty of dsa and sa sets do, however. 
It's not just clicky switches, but tactile switches as well; the bump you feel is a leaf spring inside pushing over a plastic bump on the stem of the switch, and when the stem comes back up the leaf spring needs to go over the bump again, backwards. This requires a certain amount of force from the spring inside pushing upwards.
Not gonna lie, tactical switches sound like they'd be pretty badass.\n\nAlso, nice build!
So you can put plate mount stabs in, but you'd want to glue them in place? And you'd be able to do the same with PCB mount stabs?
I can't decide on what type of keyboard I want to stick with.\nI guess I'll just keep switching.
Just wanted to stop in and say, I've stayed with Intel stuff for years but I'm so happy about Ryzen making it out, I think it spells awesome things for the market as a whole.
Did they seriously just miss the chance to call the larger version the Megapixel?\n
Absolute value is distance from the origin. |i| = 1
Fair enough. I'm not planning on buying them either but at least I can drool.
P sure that's not how linear springs work. Linear spring is a standard/ideal spring obeying Hooke's law where force is proportional to displacement.\nThey probably used something like a spring with a lower spring constant but higher initial displacement (longer spring when uncompressed) to have a lower force slope but same actuation force.
So I've figured out how to directly mess with gold earned using commonEarned, but how do you directly mess with experience and dragon experience?
Nah, they're the silvery logos 
Only one way to solve this.\nYou have to break the fourth wall.
Hey guys,\n\nApart from a custom plate, where could I get a 60% plate that would work for a handwiring build, which I'm guessing would need plate mount rather than PCB mount stabilizers?\n\nAll of the plates I've been able to find say they only support PCB mount stabs.
Thanks for the giveaway!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/aZglH
Sounds like your HHKB is wanting for a PBT spacebar :P\nDamn fine setups though.\n\nGotta say the little black 2 next to the metal sticker is hilarious.
Wonder how much will end up getting donated
Haha, I just figured out I can set this.bossesDefeated and this.enemiesDefeated but I think there are caps on those. 
From what I'm seeing, you might actually do nicely with clears. They have the same actuation distance, just like Browns and blues, but due to higher spring force are much easier to feather.\n\nJailhouse blues might work; they have the actuation up high as well as really shortened travel distance. Just keep in that since travel distance is forced shorter it's harder to feather and easier to bottom out.\n\nSomething like Topre is probably not your answer since even though the actuation distance is high, you tend to bottom out anyways so you have long travel unless you dental band.
It just keeps going...
Thanks bb ;)\nI personally used some [Super Lube](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Lube-51004-Synthetic-Viscosity/dp/B000UKUHXK) on stems and springs as a cheap alternative to some Krytox mixture. I don't have anything to compare to but it seemed to work fine.

You'd need a set with a split RShift. I think the profiles for Home, PgUp, PgDn, End are different as well but that's less of a problem.
78g is probably your cup of tea
Really took the L on that one
Thank you pupper
I would think that would have more to do with the design of the case, as in, say, having a totally flat case with an extra strip of acrylic under the front. If you want adjustable angle I don't see why you couldn't have adjustable legs in the front like most keyboards have in the back, with or without the passive angle.
Question: does the plate support plate-mount stabs? It looks like the ones in your album are glued in, which I didn't know was something you could do.
ALL THOSE EXPOSED WIRES\nI WOULD TOTALLY TAP THAT
Ahhhhh, I understand now. Will take a while, the kit is huge.
Indeed, she's working perfectly now that I re-aligned everything a few times. \n\nI can't imagine that they're held on by just pressure, since IIRC there are holes under the springs and having airtight seals should make the cups fart with every key press. Also, one dome was partially coming off and was sticking to the PCB kind of like a sticky note effect, although it's entirely possible that the stickiness is just an effect of age.
Just waiting for /u/fuckswithducks to show up
Ooh this is the cop car keyboard isn't it?
Not familiar with this mod, are these domes supposed to be better somehow?
As long as you're including Topre EC clones, might as well throw in some more.\n\nPlum Nano75, 84, 96, and 108\n\nNoppoo EC108-Pro\n\nSome of those are available in 45g and 35g, I think some of them only in 35g. All are MX compatible IIRC.
That, or certain notched plates which typically don't come on prebuilt boards.
Interesting. That's not how any of the Trackpoints I've used have behaved, at least in Windows.
Definitely /r/MechanicalKeyboards 
He's reminding them to leave room for Jesus.

Ayy lmao this should be good
Rice sock. Makes a great wrist rest :D\n\nWhen it gets cold you can stick it in the microwave and it comes out nice and toasty.
IIRC GMK Hydro is out soon.
You could try a set like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Backlit-Keycaps-Doubleshot-Mechanical-Keyboards/dp/B01FDEWDSO)\n\nAlthough the colors they come in are fairly limited afaik.\n\nAlso, they're probably cheaper on aliexpress or something like that.
Ah, basically your switches are fine and usable as they are, it's just the main selling point of this board is that it has the capacity for hot-swapping switches without any soldering work. Thus, if you ever have the craving to try a different cherry-type switch you can do so easily.
Have you checked AliExpress? I seem to remember them having a few variants available.
Wait why didn't I think of that
Hnng. Pretty sure Sky Dolch is my favorite keyset but all I can do is drool over it for now.
Mistel has posted some pictures/videos of RGB versions on their Facebook page but I can't find them for sale, I'm guessing they'll be coming out *soon*.
Cool stuff! Just ordered a set of those washers, will update with results in 3-5 weeks.
Awesome!\n\nIf you use Azerty, I had to add some keys, check if your keyboard has all the keys in blue in the correct row\n\n http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/9ed627e2313cc555bfda3cfab99d43b7 
No way to order one now, right? :(\n\nShame I couldn't enter any of the two rounds T__T
Me too, that way I can get Spanish language on an ansi board. 
It was, he added more colors at the last moment. 
YEAH, I NEED IT IN MY LIFE.\n\nGot a mix of purple and grey. Will look great on my purple kbd75 and purple legends mc rebirth set.\n\nAny way to change the order, if I need to in the future?
With the underglow, do you lose the ability to do i2c? It does look that way. 
I love the left handed numpad, but I cringed when I saw you hand wiring it.
Damn you! I now need to buy one! 
They're coming back on switchtop this Friday, I think. Don't know the price, though. 
Might buy some. I like some clickiness in my life and it's between this and fosen switches, but the price on this one is good.
The first one is there, although it's marked as german (I checked that layout first) and the ° § key is in r2, don't know why.\n\nSE is Swedish, right?
That is cheap. Even if they don't weigh much.\n\nI don't have any clicky switches that benefit from the JSpacers, but if I end up buying greens, I might consider buying some :P
The extra material to the left and right isn't of my liking, if I want a 65% it's because the nav cluster and arrow keys are in the way, but I still want to have them. Having the protrusions make it al least as wide as a tkl without a complete nav cluster.\n\nEither way it looks like a very good keyboard. Just not my thing.
I love that electric pink, it's so vibrant!\n\nAnd the weight reduction is impressive.
Bought one set!\n\nI love the caps! 
That's what happens when you don't read the articles (or even click on them) :P
It should do, however, they had some problems with the Spanish layout, so check yours before. The email is zhh19 at zhihaihe dot cn\n\nI think a tkl layout was $65 shipped.
I'm still waiting :( . I hope he sends my order quickly. 
First raffle I enter, Hope I win one of the ones i Like!
359137\nThank you! 
Black for the win! 
The windows logo, is it DCS? I love the look of it.
Great. Did you change it to Light Blue as in the picture?
That looks 2.75, the standard. 2.25 from the enter key and 0.5 from half the other key. 
My op2 also has that problem. I have to plug it in a usb2 connector for it to work. 
Yeah, I'd love a ergodox-like wrist rest, short and angled, I'm also not really a fan of the acrylic on top.
That also uses USB instead of Sata! 
Thanks for the giveaway!\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TW7urEs.jpg
Would love to buy some, but alas, no ISO.
Still no iso (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
ISO Spanish lol\n\nThere are dozens of us... DOZENS\n\nYou could try to make a international kit without the alt gr layer, saves a lot of trouble, a lot of keys can be simplified, and I at least don't mind.\n\nSee this kit from Nantucket: https://deskthority.net/resources/nantucket-selectric/27849 It has all the correct keys for 4 languages and the uk iso, while maintaining a "reduced" number of keys.
Most tingles I've had in a long time lol
Bought the bag for both Gateron and Cherry, I still have not tried either gateron or more uncommon cherry, so this will help me decide in next builds.
Could you edit it again? I've added the correct rows and fixed an error you made (modified an spanish key on row 4 when you already had the correct one on row 1) and added a color code to know the layout the keys are from, so we don't overwrite changes.\nhttp://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/edcd77e666e53e360e6b690c073592ee
Can you try leaving like a day or more?\nSometimes batteries drop so much that it needs to change it VERY slowly, also making it do more than charging can be detrimental, so until it reaches a good amount of charge it won't do anything.

Evangs, I only wanted to say that with this kit, it has gone from "won't buy" to "must buy", spanish compatibility is paramount to me.
They're in on row 2, but as they are also used for the German layout, they're marked as so.\n\nThanks for the help!
Any way to make the international kit support spanish? I know gmk isn't exactly cheap, but I've never seen any set support it.\n\nBTW, great keyset and I hope everything reaches MOQ!
I also got Matias switches. It might be that he's doing it one by one. 
Damn, I love the case. The orange and purple ones are beautiful. Shame I spent all my money on other gb :(

Really, the concrete keyboard... lol\n\nAnd really, only one iso board :(
Yeah, Spanish support!\n\nOnly wrong key is the ¨| one, it should be ¨´, outside of that, it has all the correct keys-
I'd love to buy either one. They look great!
While this is true for Qualcomms's implementation, Samsung's pumps out the extra voltage without a handshake.\n\nI've read of devices destroyed because they used a Samsung quick-charge charger.

What is the keyset? Looks lovely with the purple legends.\n\nBut the board itself is great! Do not think I only like one of the things lol
I know of them, but I think they were only UK legends, not Spanish.

This is my fixed kit, would you mind making a post to see it it fits everyone here? And if not, have people make their own changes.\nhttp://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/edcd77e666e53e360e6b690c073592ee
How do you input the fourth character on the key? Normally there the alpha, the shift layer and the alt gr one. You have some keys with an extra character. \n\nI think the mixed keys are for use in various Nordic languages, as some will use a o, some ae and o, etc. There's every key, only they're individual. \n\nThanks for the info!
How do you see it?
I got into the component gb, but not in the pcb one lol.

Damn, I want one of these spacebars!\n\nShame Massdrop isn't running the Miami + International kit :( \n\nIt'd look awesome with this!
I love it. I want to have the set, but the international kit has so many problems with spanish, I don't think I'll buy it /u/jchan94 :(\n\nIt's very strange, because you offer the ñ and ç keys, but almost all the alt gr layer is messed up and there's one key that isn't included.\n\nIf you're able to change those things, I'd probably buy the set.
YES! Another set with Spanish support!
I think Apple has started using Intel radios on their phones. They are also fed up with Qualcomm lol
With ISO and the need for Nordic you're SOL.\n\nThe best next thing is buy a blank pbt set from aliexpress, I think.
Until there's a tkl iso version, I don't think I'll buy one. I have a Novatouch, and only thing this has is the rgb lightning.
That's a great story! Did gmk say anything about using non-standard colors on the set? 
Great!\n\nI think the yellow key is good, at least from what I've seen on pictures.
Are you asking for a kle with only the Spanish and French keys?\n[If so, here it is](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@@_y:0.5%3B&=%C2%AA%0A%C2%BA%0A%0A%5C&=!%0A1%0A%0A%7C&=%22%0A2%0A%0A%2F@&=%C2%B7%0A3%0A%0A%23&=$%0A4%0A%0A~&=%25%0A5%0A%0A%E2%82%AC&=%2F&%0A6%0A%0A%C2%AC&=%2F%2F%0A7&=\\(%0A8&=\\)%0A9&=%2F=%0A0&=%3F%0A'&=%C2%BF%0A%C2%A1%3B&@=E%0A%0A%0A%E2%82%AC&=%5E%0A%60%0A%0A%5B&=*%0A+%0A%0A%5D%3B&@=%C3%91&=%C2%A8%0A%C2%B4%0A%0A%7B&=%C3%87%0A%0A%0A%7D%3B&@=%3E%0A%3C&=%2F%3B%0A,&=%2F:%0A.&=%2F_%0A-) \n\n/u/OutragedPudding Add the keys you need to add to the set to the link I posted and post the result.
Yeah, the problem is that I cannot have a color for every combination of languages available. If they're already of a language, they're already in, nothing to worry about.
No :(\n\nI asked Pheilcia in a different thread and doesn't seem so.
I like 2 the best.
Happy things seem to be going ok!\n\nWelcome back to the community!
I was thinking trough it, if he doesn't make it explode at the last moment, it'll very disappointing, but in typical Kerbal fashion, you did it! 
Pick me
482, Wolfenstein the new order, thank you! 
At least of the normal ps4. Check this https://youtu.be/6hxEUm-pHUE?t=5m2s
Looking good!\nI'm even more hyped for mine. Shame it'll take at least one month extra for keycaps to come.
I know, but most of the time it is German, Nordic, French, Italian and Spanish. These 5 seem to be in almost every set where non-English support is available.
YES!\nI need that pcb. Also, if I install the sockets on all 4 holes on the Let's Split PCB, will it work with both gateron and alps switches? And do they work on the pro micros? I don't need them, but it's good to know that.\n\nEdit: It seems the sockets are only for leds :(\n
Is there a version for overwatch? I know overcast had some, but is there anything on oem profile?
Since the start of Internet connected consoles it was up to the developer. The ps3 had no region locking, but that didn't stop stylus putting it on the persona fighting game. 
Man that was a year to remember.\n\nI hope the next year is even better!
I was almost going to buy one, the wireless and rbg were very appealing to me, but I decided to buy only iso :(

Awesome giveaway!\nI'm at 45 wpm, not a good typist, I know, but I'm improving myself every day.\n\nI founf /r/mk in pcmr and while the idea was awesome, I didn't buy a keyboard until September I think. Since then, I've bought another one, some keys and I'm planning to make myself a carrying bag.\n\nAlso, working of the Bastion potg, I don't have any recorded right now, I hope blizz implements a way to save replays natively.
Second one lol\n\nI understand hand soldering a 40%, but this is out of my reach lol
A little late this explanation.\n\nAs some of you might know, /u/jchan94 is doing a gb on keyclack.com, the MC Rebirth one, and the international kit had some problems with the Spanish and French layouts, so I modified it, but I don't know if there were some overwrites, so I want people with other layouts to check the kle for errors.
Contact them directly, it should be also be cheaper.
Best wishes from here. 
I like it.\n\nThe Shuttle novelty is not of my linking, tho. Something to do with Curiosity, for example?\n\nAlso, I don't think it'd be possible, but can there be an international kit?
This one https://www.massdrop.com/buy/tai-hao-miami-keycap-set\n\nIt has an international option. Only Tai-Hao set I've seen that offered non-ansi keycaps.
Neat! I had never even heard of the subatomic. I'll keep an eye out since that sounds pretty perfect.
Yeah I feel like it could look very good to have homing keys as accents, plus it would be a different texture making it that much more useful. :)
Wow that's sweet.\n273
Hmm they are more white than cream, potato shot is the reason why they look that way.
Hey Toastedboats, grats on your first competition!\nI just recently started on towers for the year, as our team hadn't been able to break the 500 score before.\nThere's a lot of things that I know you're going to try out and improve your score, but I'd like to point out that your tower isn't the best design for this year's rules. Last towers rotation had a requirement for width above 30 cm, this one doesn't, meaning a 2-part design is not optimal. I'd suggest trying a 1 part trapezoidal prism.\nGood luck!
Pick me!
Please please please make scooped homing keys. 
Thanks! I think the keymappings are a bit of a personal thing, I mostly modeled it after my Magicforce. I really want a keyboard that has accessible arrows, I don't think I want to have to use a layer for any of the alphas either so this is what I came up with.
Hey, I'm just getting into ortholinear keyboards and mechanical keyboards in general, and I was just directed to the subatomic. Is there any links that I'm missing that could explain more, or do you know how progress is coming on that keyboard?
But that's not a rule... *cough* thermodynamics
Main thing is that keycaps are harder to find from what I've seen with longer than 2u, but maybe I'm missing something. I did realize that this could very conveniently be split down the middle if anyone was interested in that layout as well. :)
Please don't make these artisan photos public on imgur, so they don't get downvoted and we don't have to bear those imgur comments....\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, have fun with it, it fit nicely with your keeb :)
Nice!
Looks great!!! Can't wait for mine to come in.
What's the story behind these caps? I think they ruin the look of the board. 
You seem friendly.
I like to think I am! It was a genuine question.
Fair enough question. I guess I was jumping at you because this guy came to show off his first artisan and is immediately told that it ruins the board, on r/mk, of all places.
Is it just me or does the sunshine look a lot better the the night one? BTW I ordered the night one since it's a limited edition
if you don't mind me asking, how do you guys buy from taobao? I've gotten as far as the checkout section, but alipay seems to require a chinese bank account.
Glad I got in about 10 minutes ago, page is still up but can't add it to the cart anymore.
Yup, I was also super excited so I rushed it but I gotta say this hobby ain't cheap, now I have to setup a photo studio.
I'll take some more tomorrow and post it.
Same for me, fucking drowzees as far as the eye can see.
I just sent you a PM with all of the details - most important part be pleasant.\n\nThey will put in a request to cancel the PC component and after an hour or so it will go through, here is a screenshot of my current order status: http://imgur.com/TTkQTmu
I'm one of the persons who bought a bundle (cancelled the pc part) when bundles showed up last Friday. It got fulfilled/shipped this Friday at 5am right before retail sale started. If anyone cares they are shipping from PA.
Thumbs up.
Where? Source?
Hell when you get into this hobby you have to setup/buy a professional photo studio as well.
I got one, it's labeled as a GXS60RGB, it does have RGB per key, however it's not programmable (keys and leds).\n\nIt uses  a SINO WEALTH controller.\n\nI'll see if I can upload better pictures of it.\n\nEdit: Here are some potato shots:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/PXjatwf\nhttp://imgur.com/QRCutcU\n
Awesome cap, very good job
Mine came in yesterday as well, I don't have a problem with the backspace key but rather the space bar, it sounds weird so i need to remove it and check it out, might be the same thing.
Hmmm bummer, sorry to hear that, now that I re-read my support email, I realize that they meant to say that not all stems (including current stock) were affected by the issue. On the plus side support has been quick, and they've sent me a replacement stem already, so hit them up with an email and they will sort it out.
I was thinking the same thing, but decided to contact support first, got a quick reply, they will be sending me a corrected* stem, not sure if all are affected but that might be the case
You're probably right "Please note that Dell cannot be responsible for pricing or other errors and reserves the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors. The amount of tax and shipping added to your order depends on where you have asked for the product to be shipped as well as on which products and/or services you’ve chosen to purchase. All tax quoted above is estimated; final taxes will be listed on the invoice."
Nope I was waiting on my milky switches from Massdrop, got them on Monday, but not sure if I'll build it since I just joined the Zeal PCB group buy and got my Anne Pro today. Might end up selling it if anyone wants it.
Where do i fill your pockets with money?
You should be OK this is my second DSA set after Granite and I love them, the only thing that throws me off once in a while is the home keys as they don't have a bump to them but are more concaved but I'm getting the hang of it.\n\nNot sure why some don't like it.
Still funny, Still depressing.
I ordered a bundle (cancelled the PC part) last Friday when they went up for sale (ship by may 31st). It got fulfilled/shipped this Friday at 5am right before retail sale started. So it seems some of the stock was used to fulfilled those who had bundled orders, btw Microsoft are shipping from PA.
Same. Wooooot!!!!!!
Where did you get the case from? or did you make it?\n\nAnyone know where I can find the plate only? Everywhere I've looked it's case + plate
Yeah I missed GMK carbon aswell but not Godspeed, that's going to be a kick ass set aswell.
Yup, I'm waiting on White fox, Lustro case, Godspeed, Zeal PCB, Zealios and Jelly key Lava, I'm glad things have slow down for a bit.
If you look at the bottom of the confirmation msg they reserve the right to cancel the order due to pricing errors.\n\nWe'll see what happens. 
It always gets stuck about a week and a half in customs, Also I've noticed that once a package hits the US, you should start tracking it through USPS with the same tracking number, it's almost always more up to date since they are doing the final delivery.
Is the base set compatible with the WhiteFox? You guys are going to be the death of me.
I've been looking into getting a cnc router or building one myself, care to share what you went with?
I need context on this
Do we know for certain that it won't be compatible with Pok3r cases?
Yup, this month has been brutal on my wallet. I need a break from all the sales.
Oh I envy you. Round 2 can't come soon enough.\n\nRIP wallet
this
Hmmm now I just need a way to fit it in my pants
Anyone know how to get the keyboard to turn off the lights after the computer shutdown or the keyboard gets unplugged?  Mine seems to be always on
Hmm interesting, someone wanna give that a try an let us know if it works >_<
me too
I need another keyboard
Hype hype hype !!!!!!!!!!!
Juts got another reply, not all are affected, it seems to be just mine.
That's where I got my Anne from, no issues at all.
Go Ryzen
Oh nice :)
Yup, check Massdrop's update from yesterday:\n\n"It appears that during the laser cutting of the plates some of the slots for the stabilizer inserts were shifted by up to 0.4mm. The WhiteFox is designed with 0.2mm tolerances and this additional margin of error was causing enough friction on the stabilizer and keycaps to result in stuck keys.\n\n\nWe are already having the plates recut for the entire drop and are addressing the already assembled units."\n\nShould probably contact them.
Seller seems to be providing 5 different kits, once you select the kit you want it will show you the price for it.
Done
Needs RGB leds
Would like to know as well
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's setup and I'm sure I'm going to be jelly for not getting all the kits.
I have to agree with you, there is nothing wrong with the complaint being here, it is definitely related to Mechs not to mention that a lot of users follow/want jelly keys so it's something that they may want to consider when getting one.
Yup. I wish i would have gotten black mods as well, hope they do a 2nd run.
Bummer, why is the picture in the listing then? I went through all the kits looking for it, either way I'll probably get a sakura set, the sakura spacebar is included right?
Nope, I cancelled the PC component of the bundle through the store's live chat system but other users who didn't cancel before the computer shipped (that is in stock and ships immediately) were told by support to just refuse the delivery of the PC and they will get a refund for it. Their oculus will still ship once it's in stock. In my case I placed an order and cancelled the PC within 2-5 minutes.
Yup. DSA
Sorry for the Potato shot my phone doesn't do it justice, it's an awesome set, I'm a bit salty I didn't get the 1337 kit so if anyone got a spare let me know.
Damn I completely forgot about GMK 3run, need an excuse to justify another keyset without a keyboard.
Bonus Pack just came in on stock, got me a full set, can't wait for them to get delivered.
Confirmation clearly states dual monitors, I'm going to go ape on them if I only get a stand.\n\nBtw I used paypal and it shows the charge as pending.
Oh I'm loving it, even the wife went "do they have those in pink?" but she doesn't have a mech. \n\nIt's really an awesome set, thanks for  all the hard work you put into them, can't wait for round 2.\n\nI'm still not sure on the location for the heroes so i'll be playing around with that, when you designed them did you have a location for them in mind?
Would you be willing to sell me one pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaasseeeeee?
Would like to know as well.
Guys I ordered one of the bundle PCs that has been live at Microsoft since last Friday and cancelled the PC part, it just shipped today at 5 am EST, so it seems Microsoft got their shipment today and fulfilling bundle orders first. 
I'm using my new phone Pixel XL from Google which is suppose to have a good camera, I guess I just need a shoe next to it or something.
You should blank out your order id
I placed a preorder for one and the next day I got an email telling me that the item is out of stock, but that they should be getting more in 10 days and it'll get shipped then. Hope that's the case, plus they have free 6-9 day shipping to the US
Got it, thanks.
And of course I messed up the title \n\nEdit: Yup, I came here looking for a cheap mechanical keyboard and now i'm trying to make my own artisan
I got a set when I was starting out in this hobby, not worth it, they are bad
I did it and it worked, yes it is a request but it should process with in an hour or so, here is my current status showing the PC as being cancelled: http://imgur.com/TTkQTmu\n\nSo I'm pretty sure they will process your request.
Of course it is, thanks for letting me know.
Yay!!!! Can't wait to get mine the. Thanks
Did you get your $ynth? mine came in but the stem doesn't fit into the key holder, if that makes sense.
Would love try this out, please restock. Thanks
Volkeyno http://www.livescience.com/images/i/000/027/830/original/russia-volcano.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&downsize=*:1000
Hehe good eye, yup I'm going to be playing with them to see what looks best, any timeline on round 2? I'm getting the white fox on november but didn't get the kit for it so I need that bad, might have to search mechmark
They just want to ruin it for the rest of us
Having the same problem as well. Nexus 5x, anyone have a solution?
Yup, New York here, it's interesting that you mention DHL because they are never the ones to deliver the package to me, once it arrives in NJ the hand it off to USPS who usually drop it off in my mailbox or the door.\n\nThis is with all packages coming from Massdrop\n\n
As you can see from the images I haven't build mine yet (might not do it either). But according to taobao which also has this pcb, you can do the following:\n\n* FN + ALT to switch the right light effect mode     \n* FN + Right ctr switch the color of the lamp   Light mode \n* FN + 9 are customizable lighting mode: Press FN + 9, and then press the FN + left ALT, followed customizable lights, after the completion of press FN + left ALT save.   \n \n* FN + "+" to increase the brightness     \n* FN + "-" Brightness down     \n* FN + "<" reduced speed     \n* FN + ">" to increase speed     \n* FN + WIN WIN lock
huh?
This was EPIC, thanks bro.
yup, i did it like 3 minutes after I ordered the bundle through the store's chat window. If you can't cancel it through support , I know of one person who was told to refuse the pc delivery and he would get a refund. But most people have been successful using the store chat system
Hang in there it's worth it. If you end up with an extra kit let me know.
3 Reports so far (One contacted support and got his order cancelled)
Meh
Sweet caps, hope I get one
Probably your local postal service: Canada Post? Sry about that I assumed you lived in the US. I'm also waiting for a package from Aliexpress that left china yesterday and it already showed up in USPS's tracking system, but I'm unsure if Canada Post will do the same.
Neeeeddddd Carbonite!!!!
I'm still sad i didn't get the 1337 kit but I'm pretty sure they'll do a 2nd round.
I bought one off Aliexpress, it does have rgb per key but it's not programmable.
This. I've place an order and cancelled the PC part through microsoft's store live chat.  Not sure what I will be doing with my pre order yet.
Which kit do i need to get the red control keys? The presidential modifiers are blue. 
Will do, thanks for looking
If only my phone had a mechanical keyboard.\n\nThe app auto uploads to imgur with the same title
It's OK, thanks though. I cancelled my pre-order  because I wasn't sure if it was going to work with the Lustro case, so I decided to build a %60 RGB with a pcb from Aliexpress. We'll see how that works out.
It's working again, Niantic was doing maintenance on their servers. Go go go................ 
More potato shots:\n\nWithout keycaps the LEDs are really bright so I couldn't capture a good image.\nhttp://imgur.com/oRPxkII\n\nAdding a couple switches and caps gives you a better idea of how it actually looks, although my phone camera doesn't help much.\nhttp://imgur.com/GiDxzdU\n\n\nPlease note that I used regular switches not SMD compatible one's (due to massdrop's/gateron's fault), so chances are that it will look brighter than the 2nd image shows
Assuming the software you write runs on the host computer, and not on the keyboard, you will need to tell the keyboard when certain events in your software happen, and to change LEDs then. That's what the VSP is for. Driving the LEDs themselves, the Teensy can do that, but to let it know when to do that, you need a link from the PC to the keyboard.\n\nThere may be other ways to do this (MIDI SysEx, raw HID, etc), but VSP is reasonably straightforward - and that's what I used to do something like this, that's what I have experience with. Though, I didn't use a Teensy, but an Arduino Leonardo (but the two are very, very similar), and I did a [little more than control LEDs on the keyboard](https://mobile.twitter.com/algernoone/status/835544725151232000).
It's Razer, not Razor, and BlackWidow, not BlackWindow.\n\nIf I had one, I'd try to part with it too, and probably wouldn't admit to having it in the first place, so.. yeah, that misspell looks intentional allright. ;)
Awesome, really appreciate the info. I was thinking I'd just be able to use keydown detection like you would normally in Java, and send some kind of signal back to the Teensy, but it makes sense now.  \n
You can talk to the keyboard via a virtual serial port, for example. You can do this kind of thing with that, but you'll have to teach the keyboard firmware to do that, too.\n\n(The Teensy2++ should have enough resources to make this viable.)
That looks like it'd be helpful, thanks - I hadn't even heard of it. I've read that the Teensy can control LEDs, though. Can it not do it alone, it needs a vsp?
I have no clue why it is called Space Cadet Shift. I borrowed the naming from QMK, didn't do any search about why it is called like that.
QMK is the default firmware of the EZ =)\n\nIt has quite a many features compared to TMK... too many to list. I'd suggest checking the QMK WiKi - its a bit messy, but has all the goodies.
I'm using a [similar setup](http://i.imgur.com/sgkTxaA.jpg): a home-made standing desk, an ErgoDox EZ with a Kensington Orbit with scroll ring in the middle. One of the best changes I made to my setup.\n\nThis won't work well with a mouse, mind you, there isn't enough room, but a trackball is a perfect fit.
Tap-dance is a way to assign different behaviour to keys, depending on the amount of taps it receives in succession. If you tap it once, it does thing A, tap it twice, does thing B. It's implemented in a way that if you press any other key, then the tap-dance effect will trigger first, so you can do `TD, A, TD` in quick succession, and the first effect of `TD` will trigger. This makes it possible to use tap-dance with ease during normal typing.\n\nIt can be used to do a lot of things, like put the keyboard into programming mode on the 4th tap, input one symbol on the first tap, another on the second (and repeat either when tapped and held), and so on.
Plug them in. Done. Unless it has crappy windows-only remapper or something. \n\nMost should just work, though. 
As far as I see, you can read the current mode with `rgblight_config.mode`, and set it with `rgblight_mode(X)`.
> for example, the tab dance keys. (one might call it multi-char key instead. When you press key once, it insert one char (say, the left paren), press it twice, it inserts another (say, the left square bracket), press it 3 times, it insert left curly bracket (braces). As far as i know, he has 2 tab dance keys for inserting the left and right of the 3 types of brackets ()[]{} )\n\nYep, that's correct. They insert `[`/`{` (or the closing one) when tapped once (`{` also requires a shift), and `(` when tapped twice.\n\n> for me, i think that's not optimal. I think the most efficient way it insert brackets pair, say, the parenthesis, is to press a key, and both opening and closing are inserted, with cursor moved to the middle.\n\nThe only reason I have the closing parens is because I like symmetry. I hardly ever *use* those keys, because Emacs inserts the closing ones for me, exactly as you described.\n\n> The inserting brackets by pair is a example. For example, suppose there is a text selection, then you press the insert bracket pairs key. Here, i think best behavior is for brackets to be placed around the selected text. So, this cannot be done with keyboard firmware itself. This goal must be done in conjunction with an editor+OS. (or, perhaps in the coming future, the keyboard hardware can actually communicate with OS in both directions more than just transmitting keys.)\n\nThis is something I wanted too, for quite some time. Good news is, the Keyboardio Model 01 will have the capability for bidirectional communication, so you can have your editor tell it that it has text selected, and the keyboard can act accordingly.\n\nOnce the protocol is implemented, one of the first things I'll do as a test is Emacs integration. =)
This is entirely doable in firmware: for example, there is the [Space Cadet Shift](https://algernon.github.io/Akela/plugins/SpaceCadet/), which turns your shifts into `(`/`)` when pressed in isolation, but they act as modifiers when chorded with other keys (or if they are held for some period of time).\n\nDoing something like this for all modifiers is certainly possible. So much so, that I'll do a generic plugin for the Keyboardio! Thanks for the idea! :)
Been using an ortholinear until last year (switched to ErgoDox then). It wasn't a programmable one, either, yet perfectly fine for programming. With a Planck, even better. Layers with common symbols, macros, etc - good stuff. And you can have all the arrows and modifiers too. \n\nHighly recommended. 
Oh, and erm. There are the [Dual use](https://algernon.github.io/Akela/plugins/DualUse/) keys, which already do something similar. They allow you to have the modifiers behave as modifiers when chorded with other keys, and as a normal key, say, `Z` when pressed in isolation.\n\nThe difference between these and SpaceCadetShift is that the latter keeps the modifier active for the tap action too, while DualUse does not. (This makes SCS a lot simpler code-wise)
Easiest way I can think of, is to hook into `process_record_user`, and check if the key pressed or released is any of `LShift`, `LCtrl` or `FN0`. Have a status byte, where you collect the state of these, so pressing `LShift` would set the first bit, releasing would clear it, `LCtrl` would do the same for the second bit, etc. Then, after processing these steps, see if the status byte has all three bits set. If yes, do whatever action you want.\n\nSomething [along these lines](https://gist.github.com/algernon/5da701ffd6dc49457cac2788a545b536) should get you started.\n\nHope that helps.
literally shit posting haha
I have played with the idea of using a foot pedal - it would be very convenient for a lot of things, but never got around to pay someone to build me one (and I'm not going to do so myself, not anytime soon). I would certainly try a pair (2 pedals would be enough for my needs, but 4 would be even better), if I had the chance.\n\nMy plans included using them as modifiers, to see if I can replace my current one-shot modifiers on the thumb cluster. There are cases where I want to hold a modifier for longer (to augment the mouse, for example), and holding or dobule-clicking the key for these cases sounds less comfortable than holding a foot pedal. This is my main reason for wanting to try one.\n\nSo, go ahead, try it, it's not so crazy! Kinesis even [sells foot pedals](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/products/#foot-section) as an add-on for their keyboards, and I've heard of a number of people using these pedals with great satisfaction. Also read a number of guides on building such things, so... there must be something in it. Please share your experience, too!
You'll have to rearrange your layers. Returning is only possible to a lower numbered layer. But don't worry, even if you have Colemak as your layer 1, `TRNS` keys on higher layers will look up the key from a layer below that is active. So if you are on QWERTY, and switch to layer 2, any `TRNS` key will be looked up from layer 0. If you are on Colemak, then the same keys will be looked up from Colemak first.\n\nSo, just move your Colemak layer right after QWERTY, and you should be good to go.
Small update: I was overly optimistic. While I could make KeyboardioFirmware work on the ErgoDox EZ, I resorted to some very ugly hacks, which I wanted to clean up, and redo the whole thing on top of TeensyDuino. Turns out this is not viable. So I can either port PluggableUSB and KeyboardioHID to the teensy (and redo or remove big chunks of Teensyduino in the process), or go with the huge hacks. I don't want to have my name associated with those hacks, so they won't be released anytime soon.\n\nIf someone else ports at PluggableUSB and KeyboardioHID, I'll do the rest, but I'm not going to do these myself, not enough time, nor enough motivation :P
TMK does not have ErgoDox support. A fork of it has, but not the official repo. QMK is where most of the interesting ErgoDox things are happening right now. But soon enough, the firmware powering the Keyboardio Model01 will be ported to the ErgoDox too, for even more choice! :P
Somewhere on or near the home row, on a separate layer. D/F J/K position sounds good, for example. Or, switching to a Dvorak-inspired layout could also help (still have to find a good place for the curlies, because their position on normal dvorak is just as awful as on QWERTY :P).
I have two of these, used them for years, they saved my hands. TypeMatrix will forever be in my heart <3.
$343?? That can't be right. Are you sure that's not the keyboard PLUS shipping?
I have been using an ErgoDox EZ for almost a year now, and it's a near-perfect Emacs keyboard. What it lacks is a way to communicate with the editor, bi-directionally. I'd love to be able to tell the keyboard I'm in insert or edit mode (I'm using Spacemacs), or have it change layers depending on the mode I'm in.\n\nSo my new favourite is the Keyboardio Model 01. I've been playing with a prototype for the past few weeks, and the possibilities are endless. It can already do everything my ErgoDox can (some things even better), and bidirectional communication is coming too.\n\nThat will be a whole new world, with many, many amazing things. Minor changes on the layout depending on the editor mode or state. The result of an eval or compile can be reflected on the keyboard LEDs (even if not looking at the keyboard, I see the colors from the corner of my eye, especially if the whole keyboard pulses red, for example), and so on and so forth.\n\nSo my perfect Emacs keyboard is your ordinary, split, ergonomic keyboard, that is also programmable, and easily extensible. The Keyboardio firmware is spectacularly fine in this regard.
I see. I'm afraid I'm out of ideas then (I don't use Windows) :(
It is tunable to some extent, I haven't played much with tuning it, though, so I don't know how fine you can tune them.
If you want inspiration, I'd recommend looking at the [Keyboardio Model 01](https://shop.keyboard.io/) too. It has a number of very interesting features (palm keys, custom sculpted keycaps, to name a few). The palm key is a very, very useful thing.
Yes, they are compatible.
Sooo... the firmware is based on TMK, so it supports NKRO. It has 27 keys, which is enough for Steno. That sounds like I could have a game layer, and a Steno layer when I want to type. Not bad. And being open source ranks it way above the one-handed gaming pads too.
[Here](https://www.ergodox.io/#case) is a list of keycaps needed to fit an ErgoDox. Their position should be pretty obvious, but combined with [this](https://goo.gl/OvNsxI), you should have an even better idea about the caps needed.
Still learning, because I'm doing it in spare time, whenever I feel like it. My speed is abysmal, and I need to consult the dictionary often. But I could get up to my normal touch typing speed in about a month or two, if I put my mind to it.\n\n(That's about 70-80WPM, very slow for Steno)
Yes and no. You can make macros that will type Unicode emojis, or text ones. But those will be sent to the host computer as a sequence of keys, from which the computer will know that you want to type an emoji.
The best overall keyboard is a fully programmable keyboard. Nothing else gives you enough rope\\^Wpower to bend it to your needs and will. A programmable keyboard allows you to make it suit your specific needs. Overall, that flexibility is great.
That works too, yes. Does pretty much the same thing under the hood, though.
Looking at their video, those sticks appear to be the modifiers. Not sure if it can also act as a joystick too, I didn't pay full attention to the video yet (at work).
Unicode input requires support from the OS. What OS are you on?
The problem with AHK is that if you ever use any software that goes around it, all your special macros, layers and whatnot, will be useless. With a programmable board, the host will see only what you send it, it has no other choice. Quite often, the performance will be noticeably better, too. If your keyboard has a dead-key (like Fn), with AHK, you can't make it do something else. With a programmable board, you can. You can even turn other keys into dead-keys, and so on.\n\nProgrammable boards also have a great host of useful functionality you can compose together. I've not seen similar for AHK. You can copy & paste something together, but... does a framework like QMK exist for AHK?
[429](https://github.com/algernon/emacs.d), but that does not include a ~decade of CVS commits, that would easily bump it over 2k, I believe.
QMK, and yes, that runs on OG too. I was comparing Truly Ergonomic and Ergo Pro to it, not the other ErgoDoxes. 
You can try redefining `TAPPING_TERM` to a lower value, to see if that helps.
I'm afraid, you will have to re-learn the layout. Due to the ErgoDox EZ being column staggered, while traditional keyboards are row-staggered, you are out of luck anyway. Even if it wasn't split, had all the same keys, the difference in stagger alone means getting used to it, even if the layout would otherwise be the same.
I'm curious why you'd want to develop your own firmware, if you already have a working one? While TMK is nowhere near perfect, developing a firmware from scratch once out of beta would, imho, be a terrible mistake. Doing it before is a lot safer...
There's also the ErgoDox EZ, which comes pre-assembled and with warranty. \n\nCompared to the others, it comes with fully open source firmware, and that's a huge thing. 
QMK has leader keys, tap-dance, and hooks that make it orders of magnitudes easier to implement your own key behaviour, in your own keymap, without having to touch the core firmware. Among other things. Look into the `quantum` directory in the sources to see a lot of things QMK does, that TMK can't.
Looks a lot better now! :)
Uhm, well. The only way it is similar to the ErgoDox is that it is split. It is row staggered, has no thumb cluster. It's closer to a Mistel Barocco, V.EA, or UHK, than to an ErgoDox. It also has more keys on the right side than on the left, something which I always found awkward, and that easily lends itself to placing a lot more on the right hand, than what would be neccessary, and that's not terribly ergonomic.\n\nMind you, if your goal is to be as close to a traditional keyboard as possible, while still being split, the layout ain't too bad. Though the shift is awkwardly small, imo.
I'm not saying Caps is better. I pointed you to an article, by a typist much faster than I am, who claims so. I happen to disagree with that, and prefer one-shots over toggles, but I do agree with him that either is better than chording, as far as normal typing goes. I linked you the article to show you that chording is not objectively faster than one-shots, or toggles.\n\nIf you re-read my last paragraph, you will also see that when I say chording has its place, that's in relation to Steno. The article we are talking about, however, is not about Steno, but normal typing. The two are entirely different things.
The EZ has NKRO. You have to turn it on, but it has it. And if you create your own keymap, you can have it on by default. The Infinity has NKRO as well.
Well, customize the software first. Lot cheaper, lasts longer. Win-win! ;)\n\n(It also helps if you develop a massive aversion to working with hardware.)
Interesting thing, but the questionnaire has some... interesting questions. (If you game with a non-QWERTY layout, and don't play every day, that is)\n\nWould love to see their firmware, however, curious if it has any clever ideas for gaming, that are not yet found elsewhere.
Entirely possible. I have not thought of lighting up further possibilities, but that's a very good idea, thanks! I'll keep it in mind.
I used to have one keyboard. Then I got married, and had two, because my wife prefers full-size, with Hungarian labels. Then I got an ErgoDox, but kept the old one around for gaming. Then I received an UHK prototype for testing. And as of a couple of days ago, I have a Keyboardio Model 01 prototype plugged in too.\n\nSo that's 4+1 keyboards plugged in (+1, because wife's keyboard is not plugged in currently).\n\nMind you, I only use one as a daily driver (the ErgoDox): the two prototypes are only for testing, and the old keyboard is a backup, and for gaming.
QMK has, among other things: Unicode input, tap-dance keys, vim-style leader keys, and very nice ways to hook into the key event processing flow. It's a joy to work with it, most of the time. I can only recommend it.
You find a longo online and set it under the properties (right click the shortcut on desktop and look for icon settings). 
You can definitely distribute the whole work as GPL3+, the GPL2+ allows you to upgrade it to GPL3+. But, it also says "(at your opinion)". You need to preserve that part too, when redistributing, so those who you redistribute your work to, can use the parts that were under GPL2+ originally, as if they still were, because that's the original license, and you can't change that. You are allowed to use GPL2+ with GPL3+, and have the whole *effectively* under the GPL3+, but you can't change the GPL2+ license retroactively to GPL3+.\n\nThis is pretty much what the chart tells you too. It shows you what license the combination will be under. It does not say that you can change the licence of the code you copied. It merely says you can interpret the license in a certain way.\n\nOr, in other words, GPL2+ does **NOT** mean that you can relicense the code under GPL3+. It means you can **use** it as if it were GPL3+, with regards to the licence of the combined work.\n\nHope that makes sense. Licensing is a messy topic, and I'm not a lawyer :)
That is also an option, yeah =)
In that case... I'm sorry, you're fucked :P
You will need to use `ACTION_TAP_DANCE_FN_ADVANCED`. The [wiki](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/wiki#tap-dance-a-single-key-can-do-3-5-or-100-different-things) has an example, and so does [my keymap](https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout/blob/49fd7a723dab214118b72988f05129659151c9b8/keymap.c#L732-L858).\n\nThe idea is that you'll have a custom function that - among other things - receives how many times the key has been tapped, and it can decide what action to take.
Glad you got it working! The code doesn't look all that bad, either!
As far as I remember, you can compile on Windows too, though it is a bit more painful. But if all else fails, installing Linux in a virtual box isn't all that hard (quite the contrary, likely easier).
I have a Model 01 prototype, a hand-assembled one from junk and spare parts (aka, it's a very janky device). I have not typed too much on it, a few thousand words perhaps, and while it does take some time to get used to it, it's awesome. The switches, the layout, the thumb arc are all spot on, and the wood feels great too.\n\nIt's also fairly easy to program, and the firmware is already more end-user friendlier than QMK and the rest (not counting online layout editors that compile a firmware for you - the Model01 does not have that *yet*).\n\nSo, as someone who typed a few thousands of words on it, I think it is well worth the price, if what you are looking for is a split ergonomic keyboard. And if you don't mind re-learning to type, as the physical layout is different. (I came from an ErgoDox, and that experience didn't help, either.)
I'd suggest [this](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/wiki/FAQ-Build) as a starting point. You'll have to compile it, and then flash it.
Yeah... all of my current keyboards are more expensive than that one, and I didn't consider these a fortune either. Nowhere near a Datamancer :P
I am the author of the article, and I do not look at the keyboard. The LEDs have enough light so I see them from the corner of my eye, without moving my head, or otherwise looking at the keyboard explicitly, and they are mostly useful when I turned a modifier/layer into sticky state. When using them as one-shot, the LEDs don't matter, it's trivial to remember that I pressed a modifier a split-second ago.\n\nI do not believe they are any more complicated than chords, either. If anything, they are simpler, because you don't have to hold a key, nor remember to release it right after the next key. It makes some timing issues easier, even: tap it before you want a capital letter, shifted symbol, etc. Release it either immediately, or during, or after the next key press. This is simpler than timing the release right after the next key. You also use less force, because you don't hold it. (Again, the LEDs are there for the sticky states, because if I make a modifier or layer sticky, and leave the keyboard for whatever reason, the LEDs are useful when I come back).\n\nI also disagree with chording being objectively faster. For example, [Sean Wrona](http://www.seanwrona.com/typing.php) recommends using caps lock instead of shift for capital letters, meaning no chording. And he's one of the fastest typists. For some people, for some uses, chording may be faster. But that's not an objective fact. \n\nNor does it give you access to more symbols in the same hand position, as far as I can see. Unless you want to use multiple modifiers, in which case I have to roll my thumb a bit. But that's the same on a traditional keyboard with chording, too.\n\nMind you, there is a place and time for chording. Steno and similar input systems for example, build on chording, and they are a LOT faster than any symbol-by-symbol typing one can do. But there, you have a lot fewer keys too, and hardly ever move your hand at all. There is no timing issue either, because the text is input once you release the full chord. In short, that's an entirely different way to input text.
Buy a programmable keyboard. You'll be too busy customizing it to spend on any more gadgets.
Dvorak & ErgoDox user here. I would not recommend programmer Dvorak, there are much better solutions out there, in my opinion. For example, Programmer Dvorak has a lot of useful symbols on the number row, unshifted - that's all great and all, but the number row is far. In my experience, putting the symbols on a layer, or somewhere closer to the home row, was much more comfortable. On an ortholinear, or a split keyboard, this is a lot easier to do than on a traditional one. So either an ortholinear, or a split keyboard is something I'd highly recommend, and the Planck is a great choice.\n\nOnce you have that, Programmer Dvorak is not such an improvement over standard Dvorak anymore. The rearranged numbers are a great idea, though. I borrowed that for [my own keymap](https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout) (except mine looks like 97531 / 02468).\n\nAs for layouts, Dvorak is great. Not perfect, but great. It has some different properties and goals than Workman, Colemak and the rest, so you'll have to be ok with those. Dvorak prefers hand alteration over rolling, and doesn't care much about being different, or having some of the common shortcuts be weird. As in, you'll have to remap your shortcuts, because Ctrl+x/c/v/z are all over the place on Dvorak.
There are ergonomic split boards that are programmable. And for caps - get blanks, nothing else makes sense for them anyway, with the amount of customisation one does, legends would be off, anyway.\n\nAnd besides, why buy caps until you have your layout finalized?\n\n(One year after getting an ErgoDox, I'm still not done tweaking, for the record :P)
Can I see some pictures of what they would look like?
Because the GPL2+ allows upgrading. It only lists the "Combination is under XY" when the combination is under a license different than your chosen licence. For example, if you have LGPL2.1 code, and combine it with GPL2-only, then the combination is GPL2-only, and not LGPL2.1, which is the license of your code. But if your code is GPL3+, and you use GPL2+, then the combination is under GPL3+, which is the same your code uses.\n\nIt compares the combinations from the point of view of your code's license, not the PoV of the combined works.
There's always [QMK](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware), itself originally a fork of TMK. Works on OG ErgoDox and the EZ, and has partial ErgoDox Infinity support, too.
You have access to `keyboard_report` from within macros, which is the report that's going to be sent. You can check for modifiers like this:\n\n    if (keyboard_report->mods & MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT)) { \n      return MACRODOWN(T(PGUP), END);\n    } else {\n      return MACRODOWN(T(HOME), END);\n    }\n\nOther, non-modifier keys are a bit trickier. I'd suggest tracking those yourself, by hooking into `process_record_user` and seeing if the key pressed is one you want to remember. If so, and the key action is a press, save it to a static variable. If it is a keyup, then clear the variable. In the macro, you can then use these globals to see if any of your watched keys are currently pressed.
Actually, no, I disagree. That application looks way too crowded for my taste.
Use `OSM(MOD_LSFT)` (and similar for the rest of the mods) in your keymap, and you're all set.
Try installing [WinCompose](https://github.com/SamHocevar/wincompose) then, and set up your keymap so that it calls `set_unicode_input_mode(UC_WINC)` during setup. That should help. Unfortunately, Windows has one of the least reliable Unicode input supports out of the box.
Myeah, for ARM, you'd want something else. But I just can't see why you'd need more than a Teensy for keyboard-y stuff. I mean, I have here a keyboard with 64 keys, that can act as a keyboard, and a mouse, and a gamepad or a joystick. It has macros, layers, can be programmed via USB serial (as in, you can upload a new layout without recompiling the firmware, and you can set the layer, rewrite macros, etc - without having to do any programming), and on top of that has RGB LEDs under each key, individually programmable.\n\nAnd it still fits nicely into the Teensy limits. So an ARM would be an overkill, imho, unless you can get ARM chips cheaper than Teensies or Arduinos, ones that still don't use more power.\n\nMind you, there are also libraries for ARM: Arduino has ARM chips too, and there are a number of HID libraries for Arduino that can be reused. So you won't have to re-develop a firmware from scratch!
By writing a few thousand lines of code for its firmware ;) (if you look at their backer updates, I've been mentioned there a few times)
This. I can easily cook up a patch that does just this (add a timeout), if there's an issue open to remind me. :)
The advantage will be that it is not a monolithic codebase where you have to select the features with config and makefile flags. It is a set of small libraries you can compose together, and that's a lot easier to work with. And some of the plugins are smarter than their QMK counterpart: one-shots can be chained, tap-dance is considerably easier to work with, and so on.\n\nDownsides: QMK is battle tested, KeyboardioFirmware less so. Even if we try our best, there **will** be subtle bugs, either in the port itself, or in the plugins. These will need to be ironed out. And you'd need to pretty much rewrite your keymap from QMK to KeyboardioFirmware, there is no smooth transition.
I think Esrille has too many thumb keys. The Model01's four is just about right: I can easily reach three of them, and the fourth requires only minor stretching (but is noticeably more difficult than the other three - though miles better than the 1u keys on an ErgoDox thumb cluster).\n\nThe smaller sized Esrille may be different, but judging by the picture on your blog, I'd prefer the Model01 thumb arc over it, even if it has less thumb keys.\n\nOh, on the Model01, the bottom-most inner keys on each side are also thumb-accessible, with little adjustment to your posture. (Or if you have larger hands)
I use it for `:`/`;`: tap one, get `:`, tap twice, get `;`. I use the latter rarely, and tap-dancing it is easier than using a modifier (doubly so, because normally, `:` is the shifted variant, and I wanted that without having to use a modifier).\n\nI also use it as a `Tab`/`Arrow layer` key: tap once, get tab. Hold: move to the arrow layer while held. Tap twice, and move to the arrow layer until toggled off with another tap.\n\nI use it for my `[{(` and `]})` keys: tap once, get `[` (or `{` when shifted), but tap twice, and get `(`. This allows me to have all parens and brackets on the same key, and I don't need a modifier for the `()` pair.\n\nI use it for some special TMUX macros, where tapping once sends the prefix command, tapping time sends the command that pops up a pane selector.\n\nAnd I also use it as a reset key: tap four times, and put the keyboard into program mode, and send a RAWHID message to the host, so that an agent there can reflash the keyboard. The first three taps will light up LEDs on the ErgoDox, so I know I'm tapping towards the fourth.
Yeah, but what's good for you, will not be enough for the target audience. If you want to be able to tell the keyboard which game is active, allow rebinding keys without flashing a new firmware, that needs a lot more thought and code. And at least with Arduino, you have libraries for most - if not all - of that. (Not sure about TMK, but QMK is close to being at that level too, and QMK supports the Infinity ErgoDox, which has ARM chips. Kiibohd should also support the same ARM chips, so there's plenty of existing firmware to chose from, or build upon. Lots of neat features you don't have to write!\n\nAnd you also get the bonus of having something familiar, with lots of mind-share on wikis, forums and whatnot.
Joiha is awesome! But people will be people I suppose.. sorry about all the mean rumors :(
"First mechanical keyboard inspired by typewriters". Err.\n\nhttps://datamancer.com/product/the-machinist-keyboard/, https://www.massdrop.com/buy/magicforce-68-key-mini-mechanical-keyboard?mode=guest_open, https://www.massdrop.com/buy/dot-eh112-bluetooth-mechanical-keyboard?mode=guest_open just to name a few in the same vein.\n\n(Also, why is being inspired by a technology centuries old a good thing?)
Well, if qmk.sized.io can export source code, you can easily rearrange there. Otherwise... well... instead of moving Colemak, drop QWERTY by replacing it with Colemak, then drop the old colemak layer. :)
My suspicion is that NKRO interferes with Windows. Does the keyboard work in the BIOS? If so, try holding both shifts and the `n` and `Space` keys, and then plug the keyboard in.
It could, yes. There is some work being done in QMK to make that possible, but it's not quite there yet.
Imo, the best way would be to write the shortcuts and whatnot into the macro, instead of using the Unicode symbols. Something along [these](https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout/blob/master/keymap.c#L976-L982) lines, except in a macro, and not in a leader sequence. Shouldn't make much of a difference.\n\n`¯ \\_(ツ )_/¯ `
Are you sure your QMK checkout is recent enough?
Ow, that article. "First keyboard with an open API" - no, not by far. There are quite many that have open source firmware, and can be controlled with an agent-like tool on the host. It's nothing new.\n\nThe Keyboardio Model 01 prototype I have here can do the same stuff, including lighting up `O` whenever /u/obra tweets (and you can use any layout, it will find the `O` key), and so on. Thankfully, they don't call the Model 01 internet connected. Because that would be stupid.\n\nBreath in, breathe out, stay calm, ignore the stupid. There, much better.
That's similar, but not quite. TMK's tapping, when interrupted, registers the interrupting key first. So `TD a TD` would register as `a TD TD`. It's also non-trivial to run an action on each tap, and still have different actions when the dance is finished. Tap-dance can also support any number of taps, while TMK's tapping - at least according to the docs - is limited in that respect.\n\nIn short, TMK has keys that support different action on different number of taps, but their behaviour is not the same as QMK's tap-dance, nor are they as flexible.\n\n(For the record, I wrote tap-dance for QMK after I became frustrated with trying to use TMK's tap keys, and couldn't bend them to my will.)
Curly and angled braces on the pinky is a huge no-no for me. I'd rather use layers than hit such common keys with my weakest digit.\n\nFor a 64-key layout, that is good for programming, I'm going with [this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/f938a01e31f6b329364aea02cbda9977). All modifiers are one-shot, and can be hit with a thumb, and are chainable. It's a very comfy layout.
[This](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Round_6#FAQ) seems to be the first thing on their FAQ, more or less. Most images on that page (the different kits) seem to have the profile by the side, too.
Wow. I'd get in touch with the Keyboardio folks, to see if they can figure out why shipping costs are so high. They are friendly & responsive.
It's OEM profile caps, not too different from the original DCS. I'm still torn between these and the originals, not quite sure which I like better (I'm using DCS at work, but I don't have a standing desk there). Both feel very, very nice, though. Mind you, my end-game is the Keyboardio, and those caps feel best from all the ones I've tried so far.\n\nIf I'd tent the keyboard more, then DCS would become a better profile, imo.
You can go diagonal two, just press both keys. Coordination IS a bit more painful, but mouse control stuff can be tuned a LOT. On my ErgoDox EZ, mousekeys are almost completely useless, because the accelleration is not comfortable, and I'm too lazy to tune them. On the Keyboardio prototype I have, they are an order of magnitude better, and have replaced my trackball for quite a many cases.\n\nSo, TL;DR: mousekeys depend a lot on the firmware, and the tuning. You can move diagonally. You can even do funky stuff like emulate a touchscreen, and make keys jump to exact positions. Aaand so on.
What kind of laptop, and what operating system? You should not need to download any drivers.
I'm using an EZ with browns in an open office. No one has complained so far.\n\nEven better, I have one at home (with browns, of course), and my wife can sleep comfortably while I'm hammering away on the keyboard. It's quiet enough as it is, but you can use o-rings to make bottoming out quieter.
Via USB Serial. The host can send commands, which the firmware will parse and act upon, and the keyboard can send responses, etc. The protocol is still heavily under discussion, but I made a proof of concept already, and that turned out reasonably well (for the communication, the PoC protocol was horrible).
Anything supported by QMK.
If you can find an efficient algorithm to keep finding larger primes, you'll be set. Haven't looked it up because I'm on mobile and about to go to class, but I think we're at a point where it takes too long to compute the next prime in a feasible amount of time.
Do people who know you know you're rich?  \nAnd... wanna pay for my college? Just need like $10k.
woo!
confirmed
I have considered using Programmer Dvorak, but like /u/zezhyrule, having to use shift to access the numbers turned out to be more annoying than it was worth. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of rearranging the numbers, so I have a setup now where I have `97531` on one side, `02468` on the other. I also rearranged the symbols the shifted numbers correspond to: `9` and `8` have no shifted symbols, the rest are `@*^$` on one side, `%!#&` on the other. I have a `[{(`/`]})` pair of keys on the inner side of the keyboard for all the brace-y needs. These function as the normal `[{` key when tapped or shifted, but if I tap it twice, I get a `(`. This way I have easy access to all brackets and parens on the base layer, and I do not need anything on `9` or `8`, the furthest numbers.\n\nMy layout is [like this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/28f7eb305fdbff943613e1dc7aa9e82b). Been using it for a while, and the rearranged number row feels great. It took a while to get used to it, mind you, and sometimes I still have trouble remembering the symbols (it's hard to erase 20+ years of muscle memory...), but the ones I use most, I find them better at their new positions. Having odds and evens on different sides makes it easier to remember where the numbers are, too.\n\nSo, my opinion is, that on an ErgoDox, Programmer Dvorak is not worth it, you can do better.
The [Keyboardio Model01](https://shop.keyboard.io/) is my current favourite. Split, sculpted keycaps, a pair of palm keys, wood frame, with an option to mount it on a tripod mount. Yummy. Also does RGB, but it'd be a favouirte even without that.
The `KEYMAP` macro for that particular board prefixes everything with `KC_`, for some odd reason. Try adding the following line before your keymap definition:\n\n    #define KC_RESET RESET
Choosing the single most favourite thing will be hard. Do I choose the thing I liked best in the 80s? The best thing I remember from the 80s? Or the best thing that happened in the 80s? I'll have to go with the latter: my wife was born in the 80s (so was I, mind you, same day, different year). Best thing ever. But apart from that, my brother and sister - born in the 80s, too.\n\nNot counting family: Depeche Mode, and music in general. Didn't appreciate it back then, I do now. So music is the best thing I remember from the 80s, not counting family stuff.\n\nThe thing I appreciated most at the time, is the Commodre 64. On par with Depeche Mode, and I like the C64 more than DM decades later, I did not appreciate the music back then, but loved the computer.\n\nSo... Wife for family, and the best person from the 80s. Depeche Mode and music, as the most favourite thing I remember, and C64 as my favourite at the time.
> about the tab dance key, i feel pressing the same key 3 times is too much, and pressing same key to insert diff character is slightly more complex a model than i liked. Also, it can't generalize to lots other commonly used brackets such as «french» ‹single› “curly” ‘single’, chinese 「」【】〈〉《》, math floor ⌊⌋ math ceiling ⌈⌉ etc. Since they are all matching pairs, it'd be nice to have the same mechanism to insert them all. With tab dance for bracket, seems it can't generalize to all these unless one dedicate more keys for each.\n\nYeah, having all those would be quite a challenge. I'd probably use layers, so the bracket keys are `[{(` on the default layer, `«‹` on the *prose* layer, etc. You'd just need a couple of layers. Or, a way to tell the keyboard which mode your editor is in, and it'd adjust the brackets accordingly. Or a combination of both... A challenging thing to be sure, and tap-dance alone is certainly not enough to cover all of them in a reasonable way.\n\n> also, inserting single bracket isn't appetizing for me. You mentioned you use emacs electric-pair-mode. But now, there's a situation where the keyboard relies on emacs to behave optimally. What if user is not using emacs? Also, even with emacs, now you have one physical key for the tab dance right bracket, that's kinda wasted.\n\nIt mostly relies on Emacs to do the right thing, yes. That's fine for me, because my keymap is tailored for my needs, not for others. Others can build something they like - I don't think there is a universal layout.\n\n> also, you put the tab dance keys on a relatively harder to reach position, near the middle of keyboard.\n\nIt's not the easiest to reach, yeah. But I don't use them often enough to feel the need to find a better place. If I start writing more Lisp again, I'll find a better place for them. I think I'd use the palm key on the Model 01 to switch to a symbol layer, and put the brackets somewhere on the home row. But using a Leader key sounds interesting too! Thanks for the hint!

No idea why this is even even worth replying to but...  \nI don't watch news. I can, however, listen to the literal unedited words that come out of his mouth on unedited video and in debates.  \nAnd based on your other comments, you believe Trump to be some unicorn honest politician, which is hilarious because he lies in almost every sentence.  \n  \nAre you trying to be a shittier, less edgy, more illogical and less intelligent Milo Yiannopolis?
I was just messin' with ya, but it's really not a budget build by any means XD
"YT is all about watch time now." \n- Ethan after switching to podcasts for most of their content for the past month or more.  \n  \nI miss reactions and content. Podcasts are alright, but... infinitely less goofs and gaffs and laughs.
My background is in computer science, I'm currently a 3rd year CS major so I've had a good bit of programming experience and feel it's best to learn from books.  \nThanks for the links, I've been confused about the use of all of these frameworks I'm meant to use. So far the list consists of SteamVR and VRTK, but why would I need both? And if I use both, will it be compatible with the Vive?  \n
Thanks for the tips - I've never had to develop with compatibility in mind (not a game dev). So I think I'll just start learning about SteamVR and using the VRTK, thanks again!
I've been on the Internet my entire life and I feel like I was just born again...
I hope one day you can look back and see what a thoughtless comment that was. They are literally just removing vital information for no reason. Or they're getting ready to remove stats altogether because they're too confusing for the masses.
I feel you! Thanks for the compliment.
No, sorry - should've explained more thoroughly.  \nIt's going to be pov. I just thought of a way to achieve what I want, but don't know if it's supported or even possible.  \n  \nI'm thinking I could use the data from the CSV as it's provided in real time, so it's constantly checking the file for changes in position, and using the movement from that to change position and collide in VR. Where would I even begin to learn about that?  \n  \nTL;DR: Using real-time CSV data as movement from origin.
What's appalling about that? They're a company, they didn't have to offer you shit.  \nAnd as a MBP user and fanboy, it's a luxury, not a necessity.
Almost never discussed by who? Everyone I've ever spoken to in college brings that up and agrees on it.
Well obviously, that's why things like Vuforia exists.  
$3,500 (cost of the Hololens) isn't a learning toy, it's a tool for pros who already know how to develop for it.  \nAnd surely there's a way to best prepare VR for AR - all I'm starting off with is basic cubes, accelerometers/sensors attached to a Pi unit feeding data, and trying to detect collisions. Not like it's a super complicated or full-blown game I'm trying to develop.
You're a hero m8 - really appreciate the help.
Choices are so hard 
The green dot seems reasonable.
Look at what you're doing right there dude...  \nI say there's no context and everyone rages online, you call me a dick. I mean do I really need to explain anymore?  \n  \nEdit: "angry little mind," continues to call others condescending. K.
Turns out it's cheaper to buy a round trip from atl to Vancouver, for my 20mpg car anyways. Great suggestion!
Awesome, thanks a ton for the info.  \nI've also been seeing that a single Arduino may not be enough to handle a full keyboard of LEDs, what should I look into to make it handle a keyless keyboard worth of LEDs (~90)?
I've never once seen a single school movie, be it high school, college, whatever, that was even remotely accurate about anything. Other than the fact that there are teachers and students in a building, I'd have no idea what the hell planet writers are basing their images of schools off of.
Meh, I can't remember the last time I even used a USB, especially since GitHub exists. The MagSafe connection is really the biggest loss imo. 
Awesome! I'd definitely be willing to drive to NY/Philly to fly for less than half the price, thanks a ton for the resources.
I'm using SteamVR, not OpenVR - should I switch to OpenVR since I haven't started yet?
Too real...
There may be jobs for Ruby devs, but they're about 10% of the size of other jobs requiring other languages. If that.  \nAnd yes, programming fundamentals are the most important thing, but what you choose to spend time getting good at is important, because it takes a **ton** of time to become proficient in a language. So learning Ruby may help with the basics, and there may be a couple jobs for it out there, but it's honestly a bad choice in my opinion.
Thank you **so** much for that explanation - that'll be extremely helpful when I'm familiar enough with Unity to start on that. Would you know of any place I could learn to feed data from a custom source? What I've been Googling is "custom controller" and stuff like that, but clearly there's a terminology gap, and it could also be that the technology is too new.
I like how the verified symbol went away after the first, reasonable response.
Well now I know you're full of shit.  \nI'm a CS major. Linux-based OS doesn't mean you need MacOS - a luxury Linux machine. You can put linux on any laptop, or you can run emulators on Windows to do anything you'd do on Linux.  \n  \nAs I said, I'm a Mac fanboy, but I'm not gonna bash on them for giving a small discount because I realize it's a premium, luxury, non-essential product.

Interesting. I don't have a stutter or anything, but a lot of times while I'm thinking I'll repeat a word or sound until I consciously think to stop it. Figured it might be similar.

Can't even see the companion cubes. Or tell it's a portal around portrait. And the lines through the inventory, 10/10  volvo, gr7 patch.  \nAlso, why in the fuck would you create loading screens as rewards for the compendium and then delete loading screens..............? 
Awesome, thanks for all the info - I was thinking VRTK and SteamVR provided the same thing (commonly used solutions).  
You posted this same site 18 days ago and it got about 1/6th the support. Could you tell us what you changed since then?  \nI'm really just curious.
You can tell it's real because the child *new* that she spelled diarrhea wrong.

Very, very seriously doubt you've never raged at someone.
Bah... thanks a ton - I'm an idiot. So I guess to use this with Unity C# I'll also need the C# binding. So why would I need that initial C++ download?

What are your thoughts on the new MacBook Pros?
Just decided to say fuck it and go with the 15" so I don't look back and regret not spending the extra $300. I currently carry around my bookbag with binders, occasionally a textbook, and my 2012 13" MBP - so it's a heavy load as it is.  \nGonna be replacing all that with a single laptop bag with room for a binder and this sweet bb. I'm fanboying out right now.

Makes sense, thanks for explaining. I'm still in college and this is for a side project, so it's all new to me. Thanks again!
We've got an "exoskeleton" full of sensors that feed data to a CSV. It'll be used to send a "haptic" feedback to the part of your body that collides with something in VR. So not moving stuff with your head - it's feeling stuff that you come into contact with.
How the fuck is this not deleted yet? Are the mods asleep...? Or are there no mods for this sub?
Also, the touch models have vents visible on the sides, the base doesn't.

ITT: Reasons I'm staying in college and chose a degree that will have no customer interaction.
I've never finished an app, but I've gotten started on Android tutorials, and am very familiar with Java, so I'm confident I can learn it quickly. Just wondering what specifically I need to look into to accomplish the things listed.
Hey! I'm in my third *year* of college and I just took discrete math. I struggled with the same thing - proofs. I think everyone does. The rest is just math, after all.  \nThe fact that you're taking discrete math in your *first* semester is awesome, so don't get discouraged. I've read from people on here that had to take it 5 times. I don't get my final grade until Monday, but I think I skimmed by with a 70 - barely passing.  \n  \nAs for study material, I dunno. I think most discrete math courses are taught differently, but I'd recommend looking for YouTube videos that basically ELI5, that's how I learned everything. 
Awesome, I'll definitely check that out.
The plot twist!
Just take a look at /r/the_donald right now.  \nThat is who just took over the country. The presidency, house, and senate was voted in by that persona.  
Surprised I don't see anyone else mentioning the guy's neck... wtf is that thick neck?
Awesome - thanks.  \nWhich Teensy do you think would be best to handle this?
Nah, we're just typical MOBA players who bitch about any change, we just need to embrace the fact that they're removing functionality for less hud "clutter."
Just looked over the counting algorithm (because it had the most green). I'm just a uni student, but what's a case where you wouldn't want to use this? It's stable and has crazy good runtime and space complexity.
0 context, everyone here agreeing that he must just be a dick. I'm 99% sure you've all raged at shitty players who don't make an effort.  \nI don't play games to teach other people how to play.

Get good or don't worry about it. Either way, don't post it.  \n  \nBring the downvotes.  \n  \nEdit: Why does it matter that it was a whisper? I don't believe anyone that says they've never raged at someone while gaming in any remotely competitive game.
I mean... obviously, I was hoping for recommendations on which. There are so, so many different ways to make databases. And user input is day 1, so that's not really... nevermind.  \nThanks m8

That we only have one life to live, and that missed opportunities can't be recovered.
Edit: [link](https://codingbootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/)\n  \nGA Tech also offers a coding program similar to a bootcamp. I think it lasts a few months like a bootcamp, and they're definitely a top tier school. 
College did that for you, then. The degree itself is useless, like many degrees.  \nPsychology, art history, anything in art... you get where I'm going with this. I go to a liberal arts school and it's sad seeing so many people waste their parents' money.

Name checks out
haha I assembled a few of boards today. Hoping to send out next week!
If you mean SMD assembly, yes it will be factory assembled. As for the switches, I hope to provide it as an option!
Thank you so much! Sorry you didn't get in the group. Wait for the open GB!
We don't have details yet! I gotta work with everyone in the group. The boards are just getting ready for the also. 
Yep, with the shorcuts you can cycle between your bases pretty easily. You can get the camera shortcuts in the settings, pretty sure they are in the camera section. Such a long time that I dont play it, will check that tonight. \n\nSince I didnt have the lasts expansions, I give up playing. Oh well, maybe I can return later this year, just need to get some extra cash hehe
I'm pumped to see it too, can't wait!
But even with the lack of macro keys is doesn't not have keys for the groups and locations 😂😂 but seriously if you can do that very likely you are going to become news in the SC2 universe
Will the gb include assembly?
I made a resin case today!!! Will post it on the sub tomorrow when I get good pictures
Yessir atmega32u4!
[That logo looks familiar...](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jD9MdWyBtas/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nHopefully the keyboard works a bit better :D
Sweet board! So minimal, I love it. What kind of controller is that? An ATMega32U4?
Me too
Wow, this is strangely satisfying... I will definitely get it once it gets avaliable. \nWhat do you call the b-key? 
Hey partner! Glad that I could be with you for 5% of your keyboard journey! Like I have said many times, you are one of the few people in the community that really helped spur my addiction. (I actually have an hhkb coming in on tuesday) so thanks for being so great! Hope your new board rox ur sox off!
Aye laddy thank ya. 
Let me know what you think!\n
I have an MX jelly key, and I don't even have an MX Board lol.
Do you have a picture of it?
I have been working on the final version of the board the past month or so since the beta tester sign up! Everyone in the tester group (whose names can be found on the backside of the board in the photos) has been extremely great with lots of awesome ideas and initiatives. I will forever grateful for their participation thus far. Now that the final version of the PCBs have been delivered to me for assembly, I think I owe the rest of the r/mk community this update.\n\nBasically, since the last update, the board went through a few iterations with these changes:\n\n- Left hand side USB port (rather than awkward center)\n- Purple Color and gold copper pads!\n- Awesome logos!\n- 2U or 2X 1U space bar configuration\n- B-key can be positioned on the either side of the 2U space\n- Supports 2U Cherry-MX style stabilizer\n- Better reset button (from plastic button to metal)\n\nSo what happens from here on? I am assembling the boards for the beta testers (I call them the OAs =D). Hoping to ship them over the next few weeks! Barring any major flaws in the electrical design, the group will be launching a GB for everyone soon!\n\nOnce again, I am extremely grateful for my Miuni32 beta testers who have volunteered their time and talents. And I also appreciate all the inspirations and the positive spirit of the r/mk community! I love you all!\n
Lol I actually have not been on one, but the idea was that we'd use the board on the transit!
Hey my name is on there!!
Lol so is mine!
I can't keep buying those 30% memepads! My wallet hates me as is (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) 
indeed!
dope - can't wait to see it!
Hahahaha I wish it did! I actually use very few macro keys anyways. Might be fun to try it 
Looks delicious!
When would the GB be, and how much would they go for?
PCBWay.com
Too true, in the same boat....
Not edible ;)
So upsetting I missed out on the testing period. I guess I never got the email! I was looking forward to helping out with this project so much.\n\nGreat work man, I'm so happy it finally worked out and it looks amazing 
Such a cute board!
Wallet is never our friend... 
Ah, a Terran player, that means the Miuni will have a mode for SC2?? hahahah just kidding
F1/F2 will have to be mapped somewhere on the board for sure. And.... I didn't know a location can have short cut?!\n\n
I shall hopefully be taking one with R3 Minivan soon! Right? lolol
*Trillwill* FTFY
woo!
yo when am I getting that shout out on IG that you promised lol
It was the first time that I ever thought "Wow this keyboard is bad" upon first use.
I typed on one at target, it is almost a dis-orienting feeling. The click occurs at a really weird point, I have a typing video on my phone if anyone wants to see it.
*B E Z E L*
heh
Are these r2?
Reproduction when?
Madlads is like for people who think they are rebellious / edgy when in the eye of the common public they are doing something fairly normal. Not sure this fits.
Mine satisfied me for the 2 years I had it https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3z2tw4/custom_unicomp_104_photoshoot/
Need this for my hhkb!
normal?
lol edit has been made xD
I fall somewhere between Outcast and Irredeemable. But I think I'm done now that I have my hhkb :)
That is a shadow on his arm...
Depends on which layout you want / purpose of the board.
325 ty op
Pick me
yay!
I tried to explain that I liked keyboards to a dude at my work, and he replied with "Yeah I'm more of a printer guy."
I'll get back to you if I get it done :)
Vortex Core has split spacebar, this is something else. Also the top right keys are different sizes.
@samiscoolco
Realforce RGB. Topre is king <3
USA, thanks though!
Do we have any kind of head count? I'm probably coming and bringing a friend!
it even plays commercials from the time period! I love that channel!
This picture makes me feel good.

Sounds good! Hope to see you there!
;)
OK cool. I'm either going with this one, or the orange one offered below.

My sister has a dye sub printer, I might low key try to make a 60% cover with this design
Personal preference.. but low key, topre is the best.
Can I see a picture of it by chance? Orange is my preferred color
Are you willing to sell me just the spacebar?
Their ig is so infuriatingly cringe-worthy.
I went on a similar quest a while back (looking for the perfect linear) I went from Cherry Reds, to Gateron Yellows, to Topre.. and now I will never use anything linear again! But good luck on your hunt!
Yeah man of course!
forgot to tag you u/evangs\n
I can vouch that it is good for League and CSGO.
Topre :)
Good question, we need answers.
lolol, I always just assume they don't fully understand english. It helps me keep my sanity.
I guess lol. I use one too!
From an AEK keyboard, they can't be bought aftermarket iirc.
I feel you on that.
HHKB Layout bois
Unicomp makes good quality keebs, I can confirm.
pm\n
aight, its cool
I dont think I could really do a good job of describing it. There is some great action, and lots of emotional conflict. Check it out!
Haha Dragon Maid was great! Didn't even notice that.
Wait why isn't your HHKB in use at ALL times???
boards in atlanta lol
hhkb mods ples
Not really a comparable switch.. but imagine something that feels really smooth, with a huge bump.
Dude that is awesome!
And then one of them says "It's just a keyboard"
That artisan low key fits the color scheme of the board too.. I can see why you bought such a nice keycap!
pm\n
woo!
Time to start making a custom PCB I guess, right? lol
I'm in the same spot, except neither have arrived yet. HHKB gets here today. And then there is my r3 minivan, which only based god u/evangs could know when that arrives.
racist
Video?
Weird, I've only ever seen this when people spill things into their keyboard. I'll ask on discord for you.
>if his hhkb has topre
I really enjoyed Mirai Nikki after watching AGK for a lot of the same reasons.
yooyoyoyoyooyyo i NEED a topre spacebar. consider my money already in your pocket.
Re:Zero almost tore me apart more than breaking my first keyboard.
thats what i was wondering lol
:(
Just bought an hhkb on a "whim". I can let you know on Tuesday what it's like.
Man that sounds cool! Where can I get one of those??
lol Thank you Reese.
I'm not sure if I want a printed one though.\n

Sure. \nI don't have my unit yet, but I'll send you a message once I do. 
Oh crap. \nI was actually planning on replacing the pcb on this puppy. \nMy you provide more pictures? 
Ah that's interesting, I will keep that in mind in the future
Have you switched the power switch on the psu? \nDoes it spark life before shutting down or does it just stay shut? \nHave you properly wired the case power button? \nEDIT: looking at the picture it looks like you haven't wired the front panel. 
I voted! 
It is, and it's awesome. \nA little expensive. \nBut awesome. 
Ohhhh I had no idea those existed, would you provide info and pictures about this? Or do you know a place where I could find info? (I mean more than the ebay thing) 
You could use http://builder.swillkb.com to get an idea. But every plate is different really. \nI think your best bet it to buy it and measure yourself. 
I think it's your temper you should bend back. 
I'm more attracted to the other caps\nWhat are those? 
Yes I'll look into it, thank you. 
Well well, let's not shock you. \nI live in Europe BTW :D
I will read that, if you want to explain what ghosting really is I'd be glad to read it. \nOf course I was referring to "marketing" ghosting. 
Great! Any hope for a rerun? 
Alright, I read the article you linked above and It's much clearer now, thanks a lot :)
Damn it sucks that keyclack suspended we can't grab that anymore now.
Oh there was fosen switches avaliable? Darn. \nEdit : well he added some apparently! 
Dude stop I want to do it too. \nI want wall the switches :D
Welcome to the club :D
It looks better indeed
I wonder how bendable a 1.5mm aluminum plate would be though, my guess is that is will be pretty easy. \nFor the holes I will make them just like the pok3r (swill's tool makes that part rather easy) I just have to make sure the holes are not too big (I guess they have to be smaller if you use no pcb, compared to a standard pcb + plate build. 
I'm pretty sure there aren't. \nWhy not gaterons? They are cheaper, smoother, and have clear and milky housings. 
I would love to see that. 
Thank you.\nI't kinda hard to find keycap sets for that layout, without breaking the bank.

It's even better than that, once you programmed the board everything is on it, so it's not OS or system dependant.\n\nWe don't really talk about "profiles" here but more about "layers" and yes, you can have several layers that you use for diverse tasks. \n\nI would do a qfr + frosty flake. \nIf you don't feel like soldering you maybe able to find one on mechmarket. \n\nIf you have a higher budget you can go full custom... 
Well as a French person I can understand how importing is brutal. \n\nNone of the three you cited are programmable so I guess you could get the k95 if macros are important to you. But the cm will be better quality for the price. You won't have programmability though (maybe with autohotkey). \n\nFrankly I would advise frosty flaking a qfr or getting someone to do it for you. \nI am planning to place an order at 1upkeyboards soon and they have the frosty flake so I may get one for you and ship it to you from France, it will be hopefully way cheaper. 
Ohhhhh I could not thank you enough, I never saw those. That's so great. Thank you :)
Alright I will definitely check that. \nCan you elaborate a bit on the flaws? 
What the ?\nHow did you mount it to achieve that look ?
You don't need Macro keys when you have full programmability, it's basically the same thing. \n\nIn place of using spare keys just for macros, you'll use keys you don't use in a specific game for them.\n\nIf you want dedicated macro keys, you can always get a macro pad. \n\nI mean please don't buy a sub par keyboard just because it has a feature other Keyboards compensate better anyway. 
Hum doesn't seem like it. \nNice S'well BTW. \nAnd great white fox :) 
That's so awesome, just in time when I needed it. 
Isn't the keyboard pressing the keys of the cover? 
Have you ever released the pcb though? 
What is that fetch program you use? \nWould you mind sharing the configuration for it. 
As a French I don't know if i should feel excited or not, I mean sure I know azerty since I was a kid. But you kind of have to get used to qwerty if you want nice keycap sets anyway...\n\nEDIT: And qwerty is not bad at all if you're a developper.
Thank you.\nI think it looks kind of weird but it's stylish, it would be worth it to try to reduce the gap between the top and bottom plate.\n\nOhhh so it's you with the jar of switches and that white keycap pot.\nI like  you style.
I don't have a circuit yet. \nI was just wondering based on the brownfox tutorial. 
Yeah I thought of that solution too, I think we can both agree that it's not very pretty though :) 
Sure !\nIn order :\nCherry Silent Red, Cherry Vintage Blue, Gateron Black, Gateron Red, Gateron Yellow, Gateron Clear, Gateron Green, Gateron Blue, Gateron Brown, Greetech Green, Greetech Blue, Greetech Brown, Kailh Red, MOD-L, MOD-M, MOD-H, Zealio 62g, Zealio 65g, Zealio 67g, Zealio 78g, Cherristotle (with gateron top), Gatistotle, Aristotle, Outemu Blue, Outemu Brown.
Which caps are the black ones? 
I you've heard good things about corsair and razer then you did not spend much time on this sub. \n\nCorsair and razer are both overpriced vortex what they are, have qc problems, and a non standard bottom row, which will make finding Keycaps for them much harder. \n\nBoth are good keyboards but you could have a much better one for the money and without the drawbacks I cited above. \n\nThe cm storm quick fire rapid is a great one, you can even mod it to bring full programmability to it. It's a super solid starter board. \nI know the magic force 68 is quite appreciated as well if you want a smaller footprint. 
What did you use to print them? 
My guess is that the caps are the pok3r's defaults (even though winkeys don't look like it)\nBut I never saw that case anywhere else *_*
Please, please keep me updated, I'm interested in what you could obtain compared to me. 
The blue mat with an exploded view of a switch and keycap profiles look really good.\nAnyone knows where I can find it ?
Putting urgent in the title won't make it go up faster... 
Which board is that? 
I sent an email but never got a response. 
Ohhh nice ! heading to your build log right now :)
So wouldn't it be possible to program that on the GH60.
Well as a French person I can understand how importing is brutal. \n\n
Yes it's me, something must've been wrong with my email, sorry about that
Looks good! 
Are the presses able to do any Keycap profile? 
It's a Outemu, and yes i realized that once I took the pic.
Now that's interesting, thanks for the heads up. I'll look for that kind of professional in my area. 
hum, damn
Then you have to get a plate that supports plate mounted stabs and not pcb, since you don't have a pcb. 
Well first, thank you for that awesome, detailed answer.\nSecondly, you are goddamn right and you convinced me.\nI thought having the layers printed was good for looks, but if they get wrong because you changed your layout, or if you hold off changing the layout just because it's printed, well that sucks.\nI'm convinced.
Haha you did it :D\nThis looks way better than I expected 
Ah, don't hesitate to ask or even pm me if you want advice and answers. 
I didn't mean to be disrespectful. \nIt just seems that there are not a lot of ways to bend a plate ike that while playing a game. (op said it himself that he was playing.)\nAnyway, sorry if you felt agressed by my comment, and if you are able to provide a better interpretation than mine, feel free to share it. 
Awesome! 
I'm interested in this too
Have you purchased yet? \nBecause that sir is a very unbalanced build and not the best performance per dollar spent. 
I don't need it, I don't need it... 
You could check the soldering to make sure it's OK or just swap out the switch with another one, faulty switches happen! \nIf you can't bother just try to rma it. 
Aluminum is so premium though, I love the feel of it. 
Great, I'm in the process of making a pcb for it. 
Yes I just saw that after looking closer. Damn
Can I ask where you got that plant ? I'm looking for such plants.
I really like what you did with the mods, I might actually do the same.\nI'm not really sold on replacing the alphas though, as it will result in a really weird looking keyboard.
I thought pmk only sold custom blanks ? or am I wrong.
What is the one with two orange usb holes ?\nAlso the orange one that has an HHKB layout ?\nThanks :p
Well at that point there is not much to blame, you basically built a new pc, try reinstalling windows, and maybe try no cables, maybe the cables have a short. 
why can't you handwire? \nYou can't find a board with exactly the same layout that the minorca, but there are close ones, like the JD40, JD45 for example. 
Yup
I dont think they exist but you can still custom cut a plate and handwire. 
Pm'd
May I ask what your pen pot is ?
Great Idea, I did not think of that.\nDo you have any example in pictures of that kind of mounting ?\n\nThank you :)
I don't know if I'm ready for completely blank either.\n\nYour deal breakers seem right to me except for the sculpted profile (DSA looks fine to me if F and J are marked and if the caps are labeled.
Well I'm blind or something but this was in the title. \nThank you for answering though :). 
Alright, I might fiddle with the underglow to get what I want. 
I see, do you have an idea on how I could have custom coloured lettering on a keycap ?
I think the defective ones were replaced. No worries. 
yes, sorry, it's in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVdWFSIbqI) at 23:05
Well sandwich does not look really good with aluminum, and I don't know of any other way to make a metal custom case than these two. 
Thanks
Which size of keyboard do you want? \nI would say full size since you suggested two full size yourself. \nThen there are tkl and 60% going down on size. \nIt's up to you really, you should have seen a fair share of boards if you lurked around a bit on that sub.
I'm interested in that too, as well as the cost of the hardware needed. 
The only limit when you live outside the US is the amount of money you are willing to drop in the shipping :) 
Great advice, I will definitely double and triple check the dimensions
Well it's an off the shelf keyboard after all. \nI was always curious about shy no one ever tried to do a frosty flake equivalent for the pok3r. \nAnyway, my idea tries to go around that issue. 
That you\n\nEdit: thank you\n(sorry, I typed on my phone)
where does DCS stand between cherry and oem ?
Actually I would only buy a mouse not because of the sensor but almost to ergonomics because I have quite a pain in my right thumb.\nSo since I can not only use the board to navigate the OS(generally cause I am not a shortcut and command line wizard, yet hehehe) still need to use the mouse.\n\nBut let me ask you now, how are you man?? Feeling better or so?? Want some music that you want me to recommend to you?? haha
OK man, thanks for the update. Felt really strange that it was not already sold haha
PMed
Oh believe me....it was just a regular aliexpress buy. Probably if I get something through MD woulndt make that difference hehhe
That is some quite good review about it. If you would like another opinion, you can send me some switches hehehehe\n\nComparing to a clicky switch like a Gatlistotle, is it better or not?? 
Thanks for the consideration man! Good luck with sales, really hope that the planck GB wont interfere in yours. Dont forget to advertise it after planck GB is over hehehe
Man sorry about the wait. I needed to think about what music should I give to you. So....\n\nI think that maybe instead just one song, maybe a whole album! \n\nThe Wave from Tom Chaplin. \n\nIt is such a good album after a few listens, this is going to be one few favorites. Reminds me when I had depression. Still have a feeling down there but I use that to overcome stuff sometimes.\n\nHope you enjoy it.
O-rings with a towel or something that you have makes a lot of difference. For the sound of course but the feeling of using that combo makes my fingers dont feel so good. But thats all up to personal preference hehe
There was a group buy at GeekHack a few months ago....\nhttps://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=82149.0\n\nFunny just google it and right the 1st page haha\n\nThis case is ridiculously beautiful, you can see if they got extras\n
437 
Nice, nice. A better way to get holtites that dont cost 30 bucks to shipping here......I am looking at you DigiKey.
Ah typing test would be nice hehe
I am also looking for an ortho but I dont want to wait so much for the group buy since I very anxious person, seriously. Your GB really amazes me since I can actually ship to home not using proxy(Massdrop huh....).\n\nAlso the minivan is such a cute board but...I dont know, even it is a 40% for me still miss some more keys. 
Printing method would be like laser etched, dye-subliminated or doubleshot like
May Batman??
I really think he needed to sell these around here to lower the costs or even in MD since it is such a non common product
If you still are looking for cherry screw in stabs there is happening a group buy to those in Oco right now
The Satan REV of the GH60 is programable actually. I think then the seller is using another PCB because what he says is not true. You can one Gh60 that is also buy on Ali. I will search for the right link\nEdit:\nhttps://m.aliexpress.com/item/32629156371.html There you go. And sorry about the mobile link. There you can get a full assembled board with SIP sockets and basic pbt keycaps for about 115 if you gateron switches of course.
There are no boards supporting ABNT2 and have a nice quality. Better to find an ISO board and use like PT-EU keycaps, since the keys registers all the same no matter what board so will be much more smooth for you
You can find it on TaoBao costing 62USD, so if you use a proxy it wont cost you more than 100. 
Ahhaha I am as well, going to order that as well and cut the cost of my 1st build. 
Not working anymore :( 
If you are going to be THAT GUY, then put that on your flair so people can ask about them hehehe\n\nMay I ask, what is the feeling that gives Zealios inside the MOD housing?? 
Oh yeah! There is going te be a better quality XD 60 pcb type called BananaSplit 60. Evangs is also behind the project. Check it out, they are on IC stage
Hey man I know already past a month and so...buy where did you buy the case?? Haha was from taobao as well?? Forgot to ask that
Nah, keebs come first haha. Still wanting to sell this one and move to a better one. Hope I can sell it quickly.\n\nBut.....\n\nWhat mouse is good if I have a claw style and large hand??
Oh yeah, just remember, thanks for that by the way, there will be a better version of a 60% with arrows coming with a split spacebar. It is called Banana Split 60. I may have a link for it but you can always search on the reddit search bar and limit to this subreddit.\n\nThe Banana Split 60 will have a better quality but I am not as patient so...hahaha
But that is the ones that come from led strip or smds on the bottom of the pcb that with a nice acrylic or clear case, you can see the glow
Good to know, will remember this. But still, he can use the alu case used by the Va87m??
Leopold 660M**\n\nAnd the Exent dont forget does have the size of a TKL
This one come with PBT caps from the 1st Poker but with functions from Poker II. Quite nice board, I do have some photos of it, will provide links and put some description on the photos as well.\n\nI am the one complaining about the scrathes on the plate....really annoying for me. But the seller is a nice guy and will help you if have questions.\n\nWish that I have received the rgb blanks instead of the doubleshot ones :(
Just one month?? Poser haha 
Wait, so the original GH60 GB took 4 years to ship?
I would say here in just a few months that clicky switches are by far the most favorite type here.I think that not only the clickyness that people but they have a unique tactile feeling when you press them.
You can resolder everything hehehe you wont burn anything relax
Change to 62g spring to see if that helps
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vEn8yKtdFUCrmWUZX56r8MV2MbdQeITeWM414fKmkk/edit#gid=366841562 there you go man\n\n /u/Aznreaper marked you too in case you wanted as well
Ah already use it hehe since I ordered my 1st keeb I changed to US Int from PT-BR layout. Not that easy all the time but still might be better for programing right?? 
I will order a plastic one 1st and then think about the acrylic case. \n\nReally want to see what I can do with a budget of 175 dollars counting the possibility to pax taxes so...(Probable budget,need wait my other board to come to confirm if I like better tactile or linear).\n\nBy the way, would like to know what the hell the other options come besides the pcb, really confusing to find out. Since Bhiner has a translate agent service, I wont annoying another community member haha
Ah better name, totally support it! Such a shame we can not do this in SA....or it will only come out in May...be
I just use the keyboard tray because the distance between it and the monitor is far too short for me. I don't know actually if my monitor is too big or desk is small 
Wish I could buy one of these, but the mobile part of a 60% is totally gone after I put this one
Would be interesting if you put the Aristotles stems on to the fosen housing, that would be very interesting
If you want to have arrows there is the XD60. Probably going to be my 1st build. And it also fits regular 60% cases so....\n\nThe PCB on its own is just 20USD. 
The only problem for me is to put accents usinh a 60% without being programable, quite annoying the type ã....soma many key binds for just a regular letter. \n\nDo you use the ’ with a to create á?? Much quicker then just to press control+alt+a
Yep, I am from Brazil. Shipping and taxes are always high up here. And most of the times, for no reason :(
But you prefer rave mode on the bottom or at the top?? Still there is no way you can have :( draw too much power
But the Pro M is not TKL??\nEdit: Nevermind....
That Preonic is really beautiful. The real problem on this subreddit is that you can get really confused cause I would like to buy the XD60 cause it is more cost efficient and I need dedicated arrow keys but...a Preonic or even a Planck look so interesting. \n\nNeed to stop coming here haha\n\nBy the way, the Preonic have switch top removal feature?? 
Look I might say, that shipping fee is at horrible price geez, 21 USD for a bag of switches?? What the hell 
That is the pound, UK currency. And it is cheaper indeed :o
The Anne white version is not available?? You can buy keycaps and a specific black case on AliExpress
WOW, looks like a dream, a good dream indeed. Thoses MODs down there....can I have a bag sir, please.
Also let people be aware that this is the Type S also. Well, is written on the title but sometimes....
> Anyone else know where to get the b.fake PCBs and cases?\n\n[This might resolve haha](https://www.bhiner.com/sellerStore?seller=%E8%8E%AB%E5%BF%864681)\n\nif it does not work then put [this](https://world.taobao.com/item/45408412500.htm?fromSite=main) on the [bhiner](https://www.bhiner.com/home) search bar. If you click on enter store, right above the name of the product, there will be lots of board pcb sizes and cases.
You can get an XD60(GH60 Satan revision+arrow keys inside a 60% size support) \n\nYou can get one from TaoBao. I need to find a way to use Paypal(Maybe my dad can help me, I do have the money, just dont use a credit card). You can kits ranging through 65 to 81USD without shipping and proxy comission. \n\nWhere do you live by the way??
And let me ask you a question, why somebody downvoted your comment?? 
Dont even tell me about. Wish I could be easier for them and myselft as well.\n\nGood Luck with the new shop. It will grow quicker than you expected, just need to be a transparent and respectful seller, there is always a place for new people on this market!\n\nI am crazy, confused and eager to already change to a new board. Been thinking about the Planck round and use the holtites...just need to find a proxy cause Massdrop won't ship to Brazil :( 
Lol we need to compile the series somewehre for amusement.
Definitely check if this one sells over Brazil. But only after my keeb build and have to save a bit of money to buy a gift. At least since I am on college time the mouse if not that necessary.
Cant do that, only if you already have funds from other sales. I could actually use the bank account via Paypal but only to local vendors. \n\nWill see another methods later this week
Yes it is, you can see if the seller is trustworthy also by the people who buy from him. This seller is the one who is able to offer the TADA68 in China(Through Taobao).
Well, you dont really to use LEDs anyway, just have it is already a good looking case haha. Is possible to do a frosted gray?? Post a help thread to seek for a seller who does custom acrylic cases
I always thought they were actually a 'copy' because they also sell pcbs on the shop regarding that the pcb have Poker 2 functionality. Though my pcb looks pretty much like the original though
Does it work with the XD60 if using also s plate??
Those Kappa keycaps hahahaha just amazing twitch feelings
That much depends what you consider a reasonable price hehehe \n\nThere is a 90 dollar mk with clears (TKL, Ganns 87) on AliExpress. Thats the most cheap you can get, if you are noy getting a used one of course
Man you know that use gateron housing is far cheaper right?? Only if you prefer the clear housing hehe love those even though I dont have them :(
Well, with thats probably 3,4 layouts to get everything you can use or even more. With a nice controller I guess there will be no issues. Justs dont know where to type to get that letter or symbol you want haha
Did you still have the link?? That could save me a big time hehe
Off topic but how is the SwitchBoard going?? Curious about when is it going to come
May I ask something?? Is not better to provide 46 switches?? Because I does not make sense to me that I need to get 4 extra switches for the layout 6 somewhere else.
I am impatient as well, going to order one in the end of the month. Focusing on a non solder way for my 1st build haha, just really dont know if the screw in stabs will work on the XD60
https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Tada68-Mechanical-keyboard-gateron-swtich-65-layout-Dye-sub-keycaps-cherry-profils/2230037_32790922659.html?spm=2114.12010615.0.0.TNGIZ3 
If they have the same screws placement of Filco or have the same as the VA87M/VB87M then you can use them. Since Leopold and Varmilo are made on the same factory, almost sure you use one of those alu cases they sell.
This is the [SwitchBoard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5q9y68/switchboard_preparing_for_production/)
And dont forget the base set is a TKL+Numpad+Compatible set for most "unusual" boards sizes like 65% and 75%+ISO pack(❤❤) so that explain the high price
Than you should get a Duck man, thats look more an endgame for me.\n\nMaybe in the future I would get a Kustom. But unt there, I am really fine with the "cheaper" ones.\n\nDont forget to post the board with new switches here 
Already sold or pending??
Ah that makes sense. Thanks for the info man.\n\n
What is the name of this keycap set?? Thinking about Educational 101 dont know why haha
Wow, such a shame its not in production anymore,  right?? Looks so good
Since you have it, how it feels to a poker II case or a regular 60% plastic case??
You are welcome! Hope you can post some photos after you got the case
Well, everything is explained on Imgur link.\n\nSImple photos but came from the heart haha
Such a shame is so expensive but definitely more material then the low profile, dont have the same quality(cheaper ones I mean) and they need to use more material to do it.
I think you should give the planck a chance, unsual and optimal layouts are always fun to test.( Just saying that cause I wish I could try one someday....really curious what I can do with it)
I just would to give one of these to a friend of mine that is going to do CS and watch his face
For me is quite difficult to tell since how can a person own colors since the colors were not created by them??
There is a way to pay besides the CC based payment services?? Only will have money after I sell my Anne Pro
XD60 is the one you are looking for, they have kits on TaoBao. I will link you in a few hours since is quite late here now.
Ask Leandren when the next round of FJELL https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=86637.0 is going to be. It costs 250USD

Well, lucky you, I do save posts haha\n\n[Here is the pcb](https://world.taobao.com/item/537485105086.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.9RWSHi#detail)\n\nPackage A: PCB, Stabs, 70x Gateron switches (you have to specify in the message/comment when purchasing what switches you want)\n\nPackage II: PCB, Stabs, 70x Gateron Switches, EEPW 84 PBT keycaps (on their store)\n\nPackage III: PCB, Stabs, 70x Gateron switches, aluminium case (specify what colour you want)\n\nPackage IV: PCB, Stabs, 70x gateron switches, clear case (could be acrylic not sure what)\n\nPackage V: PCB, Stabs, 70x gateron switches, ABS keycaps(with them I you use both possible layouts(Will post tomorrow the detail about that)\n\n[Here is the plate](https://world.taobao.com/item/534771703735.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.KPN5wM#detail)\n\nYou can use holtites to make it hotswappable([Proved on this post and what I am planning to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5jeatu/xd60_hotswapable/))\n\nAnd last but not least, you can also wait for this [particular board](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5q9y68/switchboard_preparing_for_production/) if you want to hehehe the layout is on the comments\n\nWhat a beautiful copy and paste job right?? haha\n\nEdit: Damn, 10 minutes to check the hyperlink trick is right hahaha 
Thats alright man, thanks for the help!\n\nProbably will use the plastic case since the acrylic one is more fragile right?? Sometimes I am gonna to bring the keyboard to (show off in) college hehe\n
Great! Always wanted to know but I wouldnt buy of these because it is too big for me. Only 60% or smaller hahah specially since I am using in a keyboard tray
Talking about MODs actually, Zealios for me is just 12 USD. I know that is does not have tracking but still MOds should be a little less expensive regarding shipping. 
The set name looks like more to Carribean Ocean or Carribean Summer then to Swimming with the fishes.\n\nThis is a XD60 improved, I think I am in love, specially because it will a more quality product then the XD60, even with a special set just for it ❤ \n\nDamn
Still really dont know why Massdrop dont have a way to ship to Brazil...\nI think is better to shop at OLKB store to get one of these, no way of getting one of these through an proxy during MD GB time.
thanks! Love the "stickers"
Woot. I'm getting this. 
Damn.. now I want all the colors...
where is the golden legend 0_0?
Have no clue what the concern is. Wish I had this kind of demographic in my graduating class. I graduated from UW in engineering where the ratio was more like 99:1. Male to Female that is. 
I look forward!!
It's not cheap for sure. I bought R1 because it has extremely nice quality.
Bought a set. Waited for a while for this. 
Haha it's at https://www.instagram.com/bigtuna.io/\nThanks for noticing!
Grrr I want one!!
This aging man does not have the sensitivity any longer to be able to tell the difference lol
hahahahahahahahah sir yessir!
Ya there is upfront investment you gotta make such as iron and solder. But you can get a good quality one from amazon for pretty cheap. 
Haha we must do a special edition... =P. 
Thanks for your support! You can still subscribe to the emails. Honestly I am struggling to figure out how to make the updates more approachable to everyone. I don't want to spam /mk with every pesky update. I for sure dont' want to spam the newsletter subscribers with multiple emails a day either! So perhaps sub-reddit is the answer? Sub-Reddit is what you meant, ya? Thanks :)
Haha you got it. It is the hemp cream from Body Shop. I also have the Gardener from Crabtree & Evelyn right next to that. Closer to the window, I have a small Loccitane hand cream too.\n\nAnd I must disclose my g/f is a fan of hand creams... I just use them... 
a
Thank you! Feel free to sign up to the email :)
I don't know on the pricing yet. For the GB for the Beta version, it will be $35 or less plus shipping to wherever you are for the assembled PCB. I am working on putting together a kit (assembled keyboard + case and etc) with the help of this community, but it is still too early to tell on the kit pricing!
Haha thanks appreciate it :). Keep the space unoccupied then!
 Never understood sticker bombing (especially when key boards are so expensive). Yet i see it really adds personality and character. This is definitely catching on in my heart. Gotta try it myself! 
LOL!
Ya spend time watching videos. Post questions and you will also get answers. It will all come together soon. 
Not sure about the intention of the bezel but that is a seriously high quality stuff! Keep it up! 
I see empty space on your desk. *Buy more keyboards*.
LOL I was about to head for work. Believe or not that is my everyday desk. Looks messy but I am a busy man! And if you ever come to Vancouver, BC, we can hang out bud!
Thank you very much :) I will deliver!
whoa.. never seen that actually, and I thought I've seen everything mechanical keyboards!! Didn't know they do exclusive release for certain vendors.
Ya.. I changed the name lol
Golden legend Realforce 0_0? Is that a unicorn?
Haha I actually use the MX Anywhere at work just because that was issued to me. I *really* don't get the reversal of the click-wheel and middle button. 
Thanks bud! My board is in the works. Feel free to sign up for the emails. I *highly* recommend building a Minivan or Planck or any mech kbd. No need to be sad!
whoa that looks huge
Thanks! One of the reasons why I am working on this project is to stay engaged with this community! 
Droooooolll. Big bezels are growing on me. Shipping cost to the US is hard to swallow tho... =(
This is incredible. Should make a photobook. Id buy one.
Never heard of Mazama but looks really high quality. Gotta browse their catalogue.. =P. 
Awesome build! I have not found a case yet. I tend to prefer high-pro cases (LZ, for example). I really have to put together my build with Zeal60 tho!!
Great job! Look forward for more. RGBs are awesome!
Hello everyone, just sharing an update here. The other day, I received 3 cases (not 1, not 2, but 3!) from /u/jolimon. They all are precisely cut and looks great. Really nicely packed and super fast ship was a bonus! Thank you so much /u/jolimon!
Ya ~$60 USD would get you a decent soldering iron. I use Hakko 888, which is on the pricier side, but that's because I use it quite often.
At this point, where do we even get the FE? I see pre-order has closed?
I will show you!
Thank you! It's been an exciting journey so far!
Same here
No father should sell his kid off, no matter how broke his wallet is.. xD #lifemotto
Haha oops forgot to give credit where its due - **2U / 1U Spacebar Feature Request: /u/lxkhn -- Approved!**
thx!
my goodness...
I await bud. I await. I await for a nice Curupay wood case ;D
+1. I talked to him. Face to face. He confirmed it. Honest to God. Can't wait.
lol
that's a steal... at $40
dang i wish i could be there too!
Thanks! It's been a great ride thanks to the nice folks of this community
Ya I need to spend some time tonight to assemble them. This is looking great!
Nice!! MORE INFO NOW
It's at www.bigtuna.io
Yes for sure! I was supposed to build them over the weekend but I got hypnotized just admiring the boxes :D
It runs QMK. You can use whichever programmer to flash your own FW.
Off topic - where do you get those figurines?
Haha I am aiming for a GB around April. Keep an eye out! 
Amen!
I agree the Marathon feels more natural thanks to the size, however I can't recommend it because\n\n *  the sensor position is a little weird\n *  amazing 2+ year battery, but both of the Marathons I have owned died from double clicking issues before the battery needed a recharge\n\nNow I have been using the MX Master for almost a year and it's been great!
Damn i want that PCB even though I already have one....
hahahaha this is awesome! The solder joint looks actually really really nice tho.
Not intended as a daily driver - check out www.bigtuna.io for more details. Feel free to participate in the beta phase. I need help on layout designs :). It runs on QMK.
Ya I thought so too tbh. Didn't even know there were different colours loll. 
Well, Miuni32 is not intended to replace your desktop keyboard. I want it to be a mobile keyboard for bloggers and writers! It's not limited tho. With some cool one/two shot mods, its power is endless!
Hawt damn this is gonna be the year of 30%!! 
Hahahaha I got that. 
Hey, thank you for your support and participation! This is great!
Great. Thanks I am probably getting a pair..
Can't wait for CNY to be over so I hear an update on this! Better work buddy!!
ya they actually work really well. I can't use cheap ones anymore. They are too watery.
Weird, I don't think it's causing me any issue thus far. 
LOL let me figure out how to create a sub-reddit first!
Whoa thanks. It means a lot to me. Truly! 
:D Thanks a bunch!
Thank you bud! Appreciate your support :)
Lol omg my nostril lol
Seriously. At least put it on a dedicated website! 
Haha I am just so glad that I am not the only one who shares this fetish =P. Great looking keyboard and please keep on sharing your experience with all of us. Honestly 30% form-factor really forces us to think hard about the layout. It is fascinating!
I touched on that in the newsletter #2 I sent out a few days ago. The revised PCB already has the support for the split spacebar. I should make these information available publicly somewhere (either my website or on /mk). \n\nAnd.. sorry you can't take 5 yet =P. Hang tight. Thanks for the patience and your support!
great now i need to swap an audio sound for this in my game
Yeah! It was at 3pm then became 2pm now it's noon. If it goes before noon I'm changing the flight.
In Boys x Girls Next Door. Tetsuya basically was Arman before Arman. I think Arman just got a lot less airtime and the commentators thought of him as a bum because they made an assumption even though he was actually working, and they aired a little bit which just gets glossed over. 
How visible is "barely visible" to the naked eye?
It was pretty disgusting with a frozen mallet...
The logic about "Shoot the Brain" is intuitive. \n\n * Open a panel. Shoot away. \n * Disembark whenever to escape.\n * If you shoot enough the titan will be destroyed.\n\n"Steal the Battery" mechanics just left me confused. \n\n * Why am I jumping off after stealing the battery? \n * Why can't I stay on and lob some grenades or shoot? \n * Why does putting a Battery in my titan give me a shield? \n* Why didn't I have a battery already in? \n * That guy stole a battery from my titan. \n* Where did that come from? \n* Why does taking that battery he just stole from my titan give me a shield?\n\nThere's also the lack of potential death from someone stealing my nonexistent-yet-existent battery. In the original, if you didn't deal with a rodeo pilot, you can be punished. In the sequel, if you didn't deal with a rodeo pilot, that's okay. All you have to do is wait until they are forced to jump off and then handle them how you would any other pilot.
Don't even need to change the name after switching the roles, just the lore.\n\n> CTs have managed to rescue hostages and are holding out at extraction points. As Ts, Recapture the hostages.
If the symbol glows on her forehead and you can toggle, I definitely would buy this skin too.
I agree! BGITC didn't get really active/interesting until the first member left and a new one joined. Guess what, same thing happens on AS.\n\nAnd the tinder example was really bad. It worked the way the US one works, for me at least.
So great, he killed him again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_LQn4G3ZAE\n\nI agree she didn't but she did go along with the other members teasing him. Which from his innocent perspective could be felt like her leading him on? I guess.
hahahahahaha omg perfect build
Why is that gatling gun on urf coming out of him??? Why not just put the gatling? See Urf Tahm Kench.
I see what you mean. I think that happened in the original series too actually.
u/trustifarian means after x amount of people purchase, price drops down to y.\n\nI don't see price tiers either.
Are we on the same united return flight? haha \n\nI know you can call to change your flight free of charge or get a refund because the change is more than an hour.
Her most recent ig pic definitely coincides with what she said in this episode. [boxes in an apartment](#spoiler)
[This made me immediately think of this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMrWFD3LWYU)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EX824HaeQ\n\nAnother Terrace\n
The "another terrace" youtube videos have all these scenes of Eric and some funny moments that felt better if they were in the actual episodes. They're not subbed and not available in the US.
It doesn't feel like any of the series. By that I mean it doesn't feel long enough. 
just...just take my money already haha
> SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST\n\nPST does not stand for probably some time.
I can't believe this is left out. \n\nFor those that can't understand: Basically reveals that Naomi & Lauren say out of all 3 of the guys, they would choose Eric. Eric seems all supportive and reassuring to Yusuke that he doesn't have to worry about him.\nSeina and Daiki (more just Seina) really basically push Yusuke. It's just odd that they tell him to play to his artistic strength and then he goes and asks her to a movie. I guess the animated movie part is him thinking about that.
I have to agree with you on this. Vaping is still new in Japan, don't be rude and do it in busy areas. Just go to designated smoking spots. Unless it's the dead of night. No one cares then.
It's definitely possible. My first EDCLV was in 2012 and the only experiences I had before it was EDCNY the same year and EZoo for one day the year before.\n\nHydration is definitely important. You're already invested in a pack and so are your friends which is good. If you do want to drink, I don't suggest drinking the first night. Get your bearings on the festival and decide from there.\n\nGetting enough sleep is even more important. A long day at a festival can take it out of you. However, this one is for 3 nights. On top of getting adjusted to being nocturnal for 3 days, you are in Vegas and there are plenty of things to do during the day. This could easily exhaust the inexperienced if you forget to sleep.\n\nYou're also asking at the right time. If you don't think you'll last, get started on cardio and endurance. I kind of take the "marathon not a sprint" more literally and train because I dance the whole time.\n\nFriction is possible. It's perfectly fine to split up to see DJs your other friends don't want to see and vice versa. I would definitely say choose a meeting spot for after sets. 
>Fixed a bug where Riven’s E - Valor could cancel crowd control applied by displacement abilities\n\nwe did it!
It's looking like the entrance for shuttles is the same as 2016, which is the backside. I'm still trying to figure out how to walk to the other side haha.

I mean, the timing is right for development for april 1st...
Guy is looking for something other than surfing though, he said he's been a pro for 20 some years and wanted to learn what it is to live a normal life.
tecchan 3.0
but did you see the gatling gun coming out of urf? what is going on there...
Thank you for giving names to look into. I'm excited for this stage!
yeah i was trying to be as general as possible to not spoil
The two rounds on third map of the grand final, I was happy to hear anders/semmler explain why they should and did hunt down the players trying to save.\n\nThose were huge economy plays.
Summercamp music fest in Illinois
Definitely miss that immersion. It's the little things that add to the level of depth and feel to this game. If there was an option for the views they would be great.
I wouldn't say it won't happen.\n\nThe original run of Terrace House were all invited to promote and to see the Netflix version's first episode.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ_SOsuLURo
Where'd you hear about the locals stage? I would put doubt into more artists. \n\n24 djs / 3 stages = 8 djs/stage -> ~8 hours\n\nultrajapan started at 11AM and ended at 9pm to give you any sense of things.
[Thandie is against it though.](https://twitter.com/thandienewton/status/803513845331410945)
Very doubtful.\n\n * 2012 - Artist's could have visuals.\n * 2013 - Artist's could have visuals. **giant owl blocked screen**\n * 2014 - Limited visuals to the front of booth and sides.\n * 2015 - I only remember A&B having own visuals. It stood out.\n * 2016 - Artists have no control.
I speak Japanese at a high school level (passed jlpt n3). I provided a counter argument to your generalized statement and confirmation bias from your limited information from your friends' experience. \n\nJust cause tinder didn't work the same way for your friends doesn't mean it's used throughout Japan the way you think it's used.
Splash shows it similar color to her hair too, not black.
Fumi-chan's outfits are so cute! What a rollercoaster. GJ Gorou.
My guess would be ageHa or MOGRA. ageHa doesnt usually do events on Mondays. MOGRA does have a-night that night.
Definitely, Anna asked where Yuya was as she was passing by.
I agree it should have a toggle but I can see why they are hesitant. I have one more suggestion though which I think is another compromise.\n\n[Diana's ult is the mask.](https://youtu.be/5u__dUSW_go?t=88)\n\nIf her ult is on cooldown, she should not have the mask on.\n
The score felt like someone playing the original star wars score and forgetting parts of it so they decided to wing it.
Goosebumps reading your story and recalling my first experience at EDCLV'12 being my first big festival and also my holy shit this is actually happening moment.\n\nWe we running a bit late. The shuttle got there 30 minutes later than we anticipated. The sun was already down. The nervous, anxious feeling with everyone in line, the friendly vibes as you slow walk towards security, security and ticket people greeting us with smiles and high fives, but I'm still wondering if I'm gonna make it inside in time to see Hardwell for the first time.\n\nWalking towards the stairs and it's that gap of nothing. It's fairly dark and I'm wondering what the hell's going on while I wait for my friend to get through the line.\n\nAnd then I see that little tunnel. We're walking and in that short tunnel, wondering why there's these people slowing down in front of me thinking, "It's just a smal--oh my god." It opens up to the top of the stands of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where you can see the entire venue.\n\n[(2014 is still my favorite trailer out of all edclv trailers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwqCTZvgU3A)\n\n[(2016 is a better representation though)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo47D-ZeMmI)
ABS vs PBT
a to z is 26. 0 to 9 is 10. 10+26=36. 36 possible options for a character space. 5 character spaces each with their own 36 options. so it's 36 to the fifth power.
Weird. Rivens I typically encounter would have R, 3Q, AA, W, AA, 2R if they saw me waste Vault.
jeez where can i get the keycaps in 22/27. I never knew I wanted them
Yeah, it's definitely a japanese 20-somethings trendy fashion thing. 
The english subtitles are the only incorrect one, the Japanese captions has it as an-chan as well.
> The last part with Avian & Yuya revealing their thoughts and feelings for each other to their housemates was really well edited. Too bad we'll have to wait two weeks for the next episode for the Christmas date...\n\nWe have to wait til Valentine's Day...it's like Netflix did this on purpose...

Oh I don't believe edmidentity, since I have found them to spam their site a lot.\n\nhttps://www.insomniac.com/media/check-out-lineup-first-ever-edc-japan\n\n"full line-up" twice in an insomniac article with no mention of art cars.\n\nIf you look at the las vegas site, art cars are shown under the experience. Not shown on the japan site.
Seina is definitely in model work mode during those scenes, but her personality definitely comes through by talking to both parties.\n\nIf you want to see her actually in true Legend status, watch boys and girls next door.
honestly i think the shoe thing was all arman, it fits some of his so bad it's funny jokes/puns.
So did Laidback Luke, but he wasn't invited to perform this past year of 2016. Which shocked and crushed me a bit.

I think we have a love hexagon or something on terrace house:\n\n* Guy is interested in Lauren (?)\n* Lauren is interested in Taishi\n* Taishi is interested in Anna\n* Anna is interested in Yuya (why else would she act that way?)\n* Yuya is "sorta with, we haven't defined it" with Avian
I feel like someone asked them, "how would you guys feel in Seina showed up?" and the commentators started talking about it.\n\nI believe they are still 'no-script' but Seina felt like a last resort injection of "push these people."\n
Tecchan, Arman, Hansan\n\nFranky, Lauren, Martha\n\nLocation: Hawaii\n\nTetsuya Sugaya and Frances Cihi are from boys x girls next door.\n\nTecchan and Arman would get along with the easy going lifestyle.\n\nFranky and Lauren would either clash or get along through art, I could see Franky mentoring Lauren in that regard.\n\nHansan could have some work that would involve everyone.\n\nMartha, because I forgot about the romantic side of terrace house for a moment.
yeah naomi was posting her time back in japan as if it followed the show in real time. so she probably did meet riko.

I feel like I need to add this about Triendl since your comment suggests a typecasting. \n\nTerrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door originally was only hosted by YOU-san. I think about 6 or so episodes in Triendl joined, so it was only YOU-san and Triendl. Afterwards, I believe a special episode occurred 6 or so episodes later in which they added the rest of the talents.\n\n

I'm looking to add a single LED for caps lock on/off toggle on my new custom build with a teensy 2.0. Are there any tutorials out there for doing so? I know I'll need a resistor in series with the LED, and I'm assuming I need to use 2 I/O pins connected to it. I'm going to be using the TMK firmware. Thanks!

I can also vouch for EasyEDA. Got 10 boards fabbed by them about two months ago, and their quality actually surpassed what I was expecting. I definitely plan on using them again. 
I believe it's a rooster. It was a pretty common for sailors to get a rooster and a pig tattooed on either foot, [to prevent drowning.](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_were_traditional_nautical_tattoos_and_piercings_sailors_got_and_why) \n\nOf course, nowadays, plenty of people get these tattoos that aren't sailors because they like the look of it.
Very good stuff, now it buzzes at me when I drop my TA stacks without noticing, or when kolto probe drops off the tanks.\n\nIt's fairly easy to set up, only needed to mess around with it a little to get the right effects, going to fool around with it a little more to get it just right (Like my corrosive dart removal warning beeping randomly sometimes)\n\nNew deadly boss mod?

You're right about it being a good deal in comparison to a bar, but college kids don't know that, nor do they care I'd assume. \n\nThat being said, I usually pay/charge anywhere from $3-5 for a cup at parties, which isn't bad considering it costs me $60 for a keg of something cheap like Yuengling.

Bill O'Reilly has done this in the past, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he does this on a daily basis. My brother sent him an email a while back about Bill's appearance on the David Letterman show, and he twisted his email to make my brother look stupid. He's scum, as if we didn't already gather that information.

That dentist is doing a god damn hack job, too. When he pushed too far in at the end and the blood gushed out, I cringed harder than I already was.

Yes, you can, but with a few exceptions atm. I was able to get it to warn me when my dark ward, dark protection, and accuracy debuff dropped within half a second.\n\nHowever, it can't track stacks of buffs, so it can't differentiate between 1-4 stacks of dark protection, or 1-3 stacks of Harnessed darkness. Still very handy, though.
Nice.\n\nEdit: Downvotes, really? 
Ah that's lame. The best of luck to you, mate, I hope you figure it out.

Co-requisite classes are classes that have to be taken in conjunction with or prior to the class in question. For example, when I took solid mechanics in the summer, diff. eqns. was a co-req, so I could have taken it at the same time, but I took it the semester prior, so everything was dandy.
My dad does this too! He'll put a single cookie in the microwave for A FUCKING MINUTE, then takes it out after 10 seconds. I don't get it.
When wiring switches, does it matter which pin you wire your diode to (and rows together), and which one you wire the column with? Because switches are either open or closed, it shouldn't matter as long as you stay consistent, right? Or am I missing something fundamental here?

Operatives generally never go into stealth during combat. They're a backstabbing melee class or a close/mid-range DoT class, and none of their main abilities require you to be in cover.\n\nIf you made an agent to use cover, sniper is definitely the way to go. A sniper is generally always in cover, as their abilities require it.

Yes, I'm well aware that diodes are directional, but I'm asking about the switch itself, not the diode I'm soldering to it.\n\nI basically just want to know if keyboard switches are a single pole, single throw, normally open switches. If that's the case, it shouldn't really matter which pin is used, because it's either an open circuit or a closed one (or so I think, I'm not an electrical engineer by any stretch of the imagination.)
Oh I feel your pain. Running the Belsavis dailies helped a bit, too. Was able to get a few hundred a day that way.
One time I sent my dad a text that was supposed to be going to my girlfriend.

For a couple years we (my family) were feeding a mother squirrel peanuts whenever she would come into our backyard. She came by twice a day like clockwork, and eventually she got so accustomed to us that you could sit out in the backyard with a peanut on your lap, and she'd jump on your knee and you could pet her while she licked it.\n\nWell one afternoon, my mom noticed the squirrel was standing outside of our backyard glass door, so she got the bag of peanuts. As soon as she opened the door, the squirrel darted in and started running around like she owned the place! She ran into the parents room, jumped all over their bed, ran through our living room and slid around on the kitchen tiles. \n\nSo after about what felt like 5 minutes of chasing this squirrel around the house trying to get it out, she ran out the door. But she didn't run away. She stood right outside the door expecting us to give her some nuts.\n\nTl;dr - Squirrel we feed runs into the house, explores most of it, runs outside and instantly demands nuts like nothing happened.

No, because you consider the velocity **just before** and **after** the impulse, so your initial velocity in the equation is 35 m/s, and the final velocity is 0, as it is assumed the dragon comes to rest after it hits the Dovahkiin.

When it comes to dps, combat technique is far *inferior* to shadow technique. Combat technique is your tanking technique, and while it does have a chance on hit to do extra damage, and give extra armor, it also decreases bonus damage by 5%, and increase your threat generation (really bad!)\n\nOn top of that, Force Breach in Shadow technique is a fairly high damaging attack, while in combat technique it is a high threat, poor damage AoE ability, so that would also gimp your dps.\n\nI'd say try something closer to [this](http://www.torhead.com/skill-calc#601bc0cZfdcRkGbRrbdzZ0M.3), but also do some searching, as I am by no means an expert on the subject. Hope that helps.\n

Hello!\n\nI'm working on an ambitious project (for me) of adding LED backlighting to a custom board that I designed using the atreus keyboard as a base (going to upload photos of rev 1 once I finally get my acrylic case cut.) \n\nHowever, I don't have much reference on best practice for LED backlighting using a teensy 2 controller. Right now, I have all of the LED/resistors in parallel with the 5V pin, and the negative leading into the transistor gate, with the PWN signal/resistor feeding into the transistor collector [see here.](http://imgur.com/a/rVZzl) Does anyone have any insight into whether this will work or not? Also, I'm using QMK, which apparently supports backlighting (But I haven't really explored much yet.) Any help is appreciated! :)

I ran DF last night with my group, and they said I was less spikier than before, but there were still situations where my health spiked significantly. But that's what I was going to expect anyway, because my damage reduction is still only around 41-42% (with DP stacks.)\n\nForce lightning priority has shot up a hell of a lot. Before, I wouldn't worry so much about getting my stacks and using my force lightning right away. I'd save my stacks for a bit and wait for a moment where I knew I could use it without being interrupted. But now, if I don't get an energize proc during my rotation, I'm risking my DR dropping. It's one more thing to worry about while tanking now, kind of made tanking less fun for me :\\
Alright, I'll let you know when I get around to uploading them! 
Thanks! I'm using QMK. I used TMK on my last board and I was surprised how much more user-friendly it is. Definitely recommend it.\n\nRight now I only have 3 layers including the default layer.

I blame npm at least a little bit because its default is to load the latest _minor_ version, rather than the latest patch version. (`npm install --save x` will set you up with `x: ^1.2.0`, which matches `1.2.0` as well as `1.11.0`. If it used `x: ~1.2.x`, it would match `1.2.12` but not `1.3.0`.) Because this is the default of the package manager, it teaches everyone new to the ecosystem that this is _totally fine_.\n\nOf course, you shouldn't be breaking minor versions anyway, but that's another story.

Sure; planets, stations, biomes, aliens, and all the details going into building a living universe. But only one of those things is tangible for players right now, and is a system in itself.

You see this in EVE- the large corporations have standard loadouts for various roles, which evolve over time; often, the corps will reimburse players a set amount if they use a standard loadout, but not otherwise. This makes it easy to make tactical calls, because you know if you have 10 of one type of ship, they'll have similar ranges, tanking styles, and agility; and the players have incentives to not be special snowflakes, and know what to learn to use. SC corps would benefit from EVE style fleet organization.

I was at Citizencon this year, so trust me, I understand disappointment. I do think it's a lack of understanding of development processes, though. It isn't a box where designs to in, features go out synchronously- there are different teams with different pipelines. The best alternative CIG has is working in but never showing off concepts, which I think is worse.
You have _impeccable_ taste.
I also find the Gladius more _fun_ to fly- its superior agility makes it a blast. It was my favorite ship until the Sabre stole my heart.

Fermentation seemed to stop after two weeks (averaged around 72F) - if I was bottling, I'd be more careful about measuring gravity, but I kegged it then.
I've been fermenting dough for biscuits, and oatmeal, in cultured buttermilk overnight for a couple of years now- enough lacto to get things moving, and imparts a nice, more complex flavor.

I've been making a five gallon batch (4G cider, 1G mead mixture of 3 lb honey, 1G water), wild fermented; I start it in September, let it rest in the cold garage over winter (it doesn't freeze here, but hits 40ish), and drink in spring. That 6 month resting time does wonders.

Thanks! I love the split shift/fn, even if it's a little more difficult to put together a keycap set for. Post yours when it's ready!
Oh, it's surprising that it wouldn't map, they're basically the same. fwiw, the in-game bindings work well even without the joystick profile, which doesn't do a whole lot. The bindings are nice, at least.

Hi
Confirming source confirmation
I started with a MX Red, Aluminum K70 about five years back; then I moved to a Das with Blues, and then a Topre Realforce. After playing with the idea of an Ergodox, I thought I'd get my feet wet and picked up a board with the switches I'd wanted to try on r/mechmarket from u/b32147. A quick massdrop from Tai-hao for Dark Violet keycaps, and _another_ order from wasd keyboards for the 1.75u shift, a red fn key, and a custom USB cable - and here she is.\n\nHow deep _does_ this rabbit hole go?
Basically, just like mods- there's a little distinguish button next to "save" and "report" that you can use to distinguish a comment as official.
I've had my x52 pro for a year and a half or so; I'm still happy with it, seems good for the price. It's also what the SC official joystick is based on, so transitioning to _that_ will be easy :D\n\nI did do [the magnet mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGZSx7UaVU) and it's very nice.
Brainfarted writing the description - these are ABS, not PBT. I love the very light texture, especially compared to the glossy Das; they feel like my Realforce, but stiffer. Very satisfying clack on the aluminum.
I do- and I call myself out at the end, asking that we assume the best rather than the worst. "Money grabbing scam" is kinda the worst. This is based on my experience as a developer and leading development teams, and I like to think my argument that having concept artists build concepts makes sense.

I love my Topre Realforce at work, which gave me an idea - why not put variable springs into my home keyboard? I didn't go as far as separate weights per finger, but I did put heavier springs in the modifiers and lighter springs in the alphas. I chose 78g gold springs for the modifiers, left the original 67g in the spacebar, and replaced the alphas with 55g - and lubed everything. It was amazing.\n\nEverything went well other than a bent leaf in my quote key from putting the cap back on upside down... but after two nervewracking hours with a tiny flathead screwdriver and some pliers, I finally got it back into place again.\n\nSidenote: I'd do many terrible things to find a tai-hao violet 1.75u shift key...

Yup, Mercy / support is always my primary target when playing Widowmaker. Support already puts the opposing team down a damage-dealer (sidearms aside); and once support is down, it's a 6v4 game. A _lot_ of Mercies will follow the person they're healing down long hallways, which is... _convenient_.
Yeah, increases sensitivity and decreases dead zone to where it's unnoticeable. It makes the joystick's sensors more sensitive to movement.
Just to clarify, you can (and maybe should, if you're storing it) use distilled water for your starsan + water mix, just not for brewing. Never for brewing.
Same here (there sure are a lot of us. +600 this season from silver to gold.) My main goal is Mercy hunting. Booping Reins behind the shield also gives us an advantage as the enemy loses their cover and has to scramble to reform. But soldiers are the biggest pain in the ass. I definitely have less trouble with Widows, although I don't see them particularly often.
Trade complete.
Deal.
That and Widows. I catch a lot of Windows hanging back at Volskaya and Anubis :D\n\nAlso torbs and bastions.\n\nAnything standing still, really. Or moving slowly. Or quickly. All you need is sneaky flanking.
Yup, they were just the ones people pay attention to. I have a Motorola phone with only USB-C (Moto Z Force); I expected to be annoyed, but honestly, it's not that big of a deal. I just keep the dongle in my backpack. It wasn't particularly life-changing.
It was confirmed to be gameplay, not "real" time?
It would, if _everyone_ used semver correctly. However, in reality, someone writes a package which is a dependency of a dependency of a dependency, and if that someone doesn't understand semver, I've got a _lot_ of forking to do.\n\nIf it defaulted to patch versions, it at least reduces the depth of fucked-upness that occurs.
I had this problem when I had more than one "joystick device" - at first, a gamepad, and then later on when I was messing around with vJoy for virtual joystick emulation. If you have something like that setup, unplug/disable it and try reloading again.
I love Evil Twin! I had no idea they were doing this, looks like I need to make a trip across the bay.\n\nI'm surprised it's only 45 IBU- the hops really come through strong. I'm not sure how a saison yeast would come through that- personally, I'd try amping up the hops via dry hopping. Or, maybe go for some tart funkiness through a long brett-only ferment.
No it's not worth it for me, especially because I live in the EU and shipping would be pretty expensive. I guess I'm just going to buy some clear top Gaterons for 40 cents each...\n\nI though maybe someone knows a chinese vendor who sells them for cheap in bulk orders.

You will need to solder the SIP socket leads into the PCB to ensure a good connection. The LEDs are friction fit into the SIP sockets, so no soldering on those. Wether you use SIP sockets or a usual LED mounting method, you will need to solder two pins on the PCB. I hope this makes sense

I don't lube the tactile bumb itself, I just lube the sliders on the side and the spring. I once lubed the bumb on a mx brown and it felt like the tactility was non-existant.
I feel like Zealios are too smooth, if thats even possible. The tactile bumb is not pronounced enough for me. Lubed Ergo-clears have the perfect amount of tactile grittyness IMO. I'm expecting a lot of downvotes ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯
Those are diodes. I'm not sure if OP meant diodes or resistors. Resistors are only needed if you use LEDs on the Gherkin. And yes, 1N4148 diodes should work just fine.

Damn that nixie tube clock is pretty cool! Did you build it yourself? Nice keeb too.
Corsairs have a non-standart bottom row. Therefore it's hard to find replacement keycaps. If you stick around r/mk long enough, you will want to have another keycap set.

I'll have to try some MOD-H switches some time.
This. Go to r/mm, you'll get more for your money if you buy a used board there. And because enthusiasts buy/sell there, the keyboards were usually well cared for.
Yeah I know what you mean. I missed the GB prices and thus they were too expensive for me. A old board, some lube, springs and a few evenings of modding and I'm set to go. I enjoy modding and my wallet is grateful. 
That's right, I'd like to use a single sided PCB. I'm thinking about how I could use diodes as jumpers for crossing traces. I don't like the look of jumper cables.
Oh I didn't even notice :D\n\nFixed.
But it's "the world's most amazing keyboard"! 
Wow wow wow, what kind of wrist rest is that? I wanna know more about it.\n\nAlso: ISO bro
Oh ok. Are you planning on sending the add-on pack and the PCBs in one shipment, or will each have their own packaging? 
Uuuuuuh tasty! I've never seen a RGB Battle. I was briefly looking into a mx brown Battle w/ red LEDs, but decided against it. How do you like it? How's the build quality? Tell me something about it :)
Looks nice :)
Thank god, that he didn't host that video. It would have broken his little mk soul
Do you think it would be possible to hand wire on a single layer PCB without jumper wires? Or am I missing something that prevents this approach?
What am I looking at? Plz explain.
Do it for the karma. It will^be^worth^it
Yeah sure. But it will take a few weeks as I'm intending to use them on a Gherkin from the recent GB. 
Oh god those are some lovely keycaps. That wedge shaped case is a looker too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Is there a reason the mx clear girl looks a bit prudish? I love my Ergo-clears...
If you are willing to send the keyboard to Germany, then I could do the service for you. But beware, that it would be my 3rd time desoldering and resoldering a keyboard. I can pm you pictures of my previous work.
Great guide, thanks for sharing. I'll have to try some on my Gherkin keeb.
/u/di0ib built a [Gherkin with UV LEDs](http://www.40percent.club/2017/01/purple-gherkin.html). Maybe he can chime in.
Sorry, I only had one.
Yeah shipping would probably cost 10-15€ total. But feel free to message me, if you change your mind :) 
Ikr...\n\nBtw love me some brutal fucking green tea!
You should have seen the first 2h or so. It was 33% upvoted for some time :D
You could easily epoxy some nuts on to the bottom layer. But I prefer the look of a stand-off nut between the top and bottom layer. I will also stick on some rubber/ silicone feet, so the screws on the bottom don't bother me at all.
excited
gotcha, do you think that that would be more profitable than selling the caps and switches individually?
Indeed, keen eye my fellow clacker
Super cool 
How much did you pay for it?\n\nWhat's the weight like?\n \nHow is the .3 lead?
The monkey is so cool!
So is moq only 150 being made you're saying? Price is still $150 currently?
Confirmed
Milky Bermuda, I will update this. Sorry about that!
Question, is your eraser cap flimsy as shit and always fall off? I bought one from Amazon about a week ago and got a replacement since it's terrible and the new one is a little bit better but still bad. I want to know if this happens to other people. What do I do to fix it?
Pm
No, I believe it's coated in some type of lacquer or something. Also, the cap is more used as a piece of art to put on your keyboard rather than a commonly used key. 
Yeah I was saying at this moment we're making the $150 moq. Sorry for my confusing choice of words. \n\nHow many orders are we at right now?\n\nThanks for clearing everything up!
Pm
it's actually untested and Ihave no way to test it due to having only a laptop. It was found in the same box as a working ibm typewriter if that comes with any weight then there's that. Sorry about that

I'm not sure, if they swapped domes I doubt it would alter the keycaps that were on it. I can do some keyboard science tomorrow and check it out. \n\nAre you suggesting this board may be 55g instead of 45g?

They sound great, I'm always looking for more tactility. I looked up the bke-2010 on eBay and it looks like they have only sold once for $160. Where did you pick yours up from? I wanna see around how much they cost. I really wanna get a full swapped board!

I think there could be more moderation on controversial posts and conversations. Some people need to be shut down before conversations elevate to an unreasonable amount
What do you mean it may not be worth my time to desolder? are you suggesting I only sell the caps? I have a desoldering tool so it should only take around 30 min to desolder everything plus I don't mind the work.
I've done this, I'm much more inclined to do other people's homework rather than my own. My own homework is torture but for others it's like a game.
Bought a realforce 45g "uniform" a couple weeks ago and it turned out to have 55g alphas, I'm not complaining as I have always liked heavier switches anyway. I got an FC660C in the mail today and spent 4 hours swapping the domes. God damn what a time consuming task. The realforce kept having problems every time I reassembled it and st the end I was screwing in the pcb with one hand and a non magnetic screwdriver while resting one half of the pcb on my head so I could keep the pcb and sliders at the same spot as to not mess up what I had worked so hard for.\n\nI finally got everything set up and running and it looks amazing, the FC660C has been my dream board since I got into this hobby. I'm so happy I finally bought one. I bought the JTK sliders about 2 weeks ago and I'm super excited to get those in to throw GMK on my topre. I am lending my RF to a friend who looks at his hands while typing so I swapped around all of the alphas into a random pattern but still in the same profile row so that way he has to learn how to type without looking. Hopefully I can convert him to the pit that is topre.\n\nI would love to try out these domes, I really want some type of 80g topre dome but I don't know much about anything other than stock domes so far but if there was a way I could get more knowledge about that I would really appreciate it! So generous for you to give out these rare domes, I hope I can pick one up!\n\nEdit: on mobile right now, sorry I couldn't portray all my horrible typos!
Can you give a quick review as to how these feel compared to stock 45g domes? They're really intriguing. I would love to get heavier dones
Looks like they forgot to pizza
That's what I did and it just messes with the o-ring. I don't feel it anymore. I have been thinking about putting my own small o-ring on it but that just seems like I would damage the pencil somehow. It really pisses me off and I am kinda at the point of returning it just because of this factor. I would think they would have a more secure mechanism on a $35 pencil.

You can't test switches with a multimeter when it doesn't connect to anything. I already desoldered half of it so no going back now
When did these come in? I'm waiting on mine to show up, the shipping info is definitely sub par.
3000 yen isn't that bad for such an anticipated pencil. \n\nDoes the top half being plastic offset the weight At all?\n\nThat would be awesome if you could, just some more pictures of the pencil overall would be sweet! You're a lucky individual to have obtained that
Yes and we're proud.
This one is an 87UB-EK45 but I guess the alphas are swapped to 55g, just found this out today after doing some testing.

Sweet! I'm quite excited for this. I just bought my first decent pencil last night so maybe I'll have to get a second as soon as this drops!

Afaik only Matias has the full Apple legends. But those are Alps/Matias keycaps. 
Ducky Shine 6 Review for Mac OS X\n\nJust received my new Ducky Shine 6 and just set it up. This is my first mechanical keyboard and am very happy with my purchase. \n\n\nI wanted to have RGB and a full size keyboard. After reading this subreddit and watching a bunch of Youtube videos I decided on the Shine 6 SE with blues. Wasn’t sure if I would like the floating keycaps but really liked the color of the case and everything else. My GF has a black widow chroma which was ok and let me get used to a clicky switch, which I liked. \n\n\n\nThe case color is everything I wanted and more. I usually don’t have too much light by my desk so the case looks black at night and color comes out during the day. The floating keys look pretty cool and really allow the color to show. There is a little light bleed and at some angles the caps lock light will hit my eye if I look down. I tried putting on the YOTM space bar and it stuck up a bit too much. So if I wanted to change keycaps I would probably have to replace the whole set. They do not wobble for me and feel very secure. Not any different from the Razer greens in terms of how the keycaps feel.\n\n\n\nI set up keyboard in bootcamp first with Ducky’s software. It was pretty basic but easy to use. Compared to Razer’s software it had most of the options and no bloat. You can also assign a specific color to each key. It is nice that everything is saved into keyboard memory though. Once I switched by to OS X all custom settings I made were still there (Both in included modes via FN+F10 and the custom F11 and F12). I also adjusted a few of them via keyboard as I didn’t like what I set on PC and was too lazy to switch.\n\n\n\nFor OS X I switched the windows / alt to have cmd / alt mac setup via Apple. Then used Karabiner to get F1-12. The volume keys also work without needed Karabiner. Only gripe I have is lighting stays on when my computer is asleep. Wish there was an option to have lights off while computer is not in use.\n\n\n\nIncluded a few potato photos of the lighting. I like the aurora mode the most, kind of like a row ripple. Happy to answer any questions and can test things on OS X if needed. There was not too much info about mechanical keyboards with Mac so hopefully this is helpful to someone. On a side note, outside of WASD does anyone have a set of keycaps for F1-F12 with Apple legends? Or maybe one with side printed Apple and normal F1-12 on top?\n
Are you last guardian stating since you were too far away from the action? Or teammates go solo and die? If you are too far away team shoot more and then your teammates may be alive. If you are playing with people that just go out and die then find a new team. \n\n\nAs for winning 1v2/3 you need to find a way to make all your encounters 1v1 or have a way to get health back after a kill. You can also just keep rotating until you can get a res or pop super for a res. 
Yeah first scarab took me about 50 games. New one took me one game. I had a friend take 127 games to get first scarab and another friend at maybe 75 games now and still hasn't got it. Really not worth it as it's not an emblem they would wear anyways 
That is 100% normal. Shell doesn't get the micro creases you get on calf but more of the rolls / bigger creases

Good to know, I just realized I can create and delete and redo until I get enough marks 
One of the first missions, I think on the moon, gives you the Speakers Writ to turn in to the gunsmith. One option you can get from this is the Gozen-C sniper. You can save this until the gunsmith offers one with crowd control to get a one body shot kill sniper. 
On XB1, I can match friends from anywhere in north america as long as we queue at the same time. I can also hop into a rumble match if a friend has been matchmaking for 5 minutes and get in right away with them. There are still pretty strict barriers at least for rumble and 3s. I can also never match a local friend due to skill gap difference no matter what playlist / time. You are always going to match people you know or played before in rumble for sure. I'm an average player I'd say.

SVEAFF Gives $200 off $800 if you want to try that code. It went active today I believe so not sure if they would honor it.

Probably cheapest online right now due to exchange rate. 
Did quick view of videos in addition to what others have mentioned the easiest change you could do would be to play max armor instead of jugg or shoulder charge. In almost all situations you were reacting / waiting for enemy to make a move. You would increase survivability in many situations just by running max armor. 
I used to always throw grenade then engage but it a a bad habit. If you are playing against competent people the animation time means you get sniped or enemy gets a few shots into you. \n\nYou mention that you are not in a position to get away. I would work more on making sure you have multiple angles to escape and understand them before you engage at all. That helped me improve a lot more. 
I've noticed it on grasp a few times as well. Not sure what is going on exactly. I also find it happens when you reload cancel sometimes. Maybe bungie has some internal limit on how fast you can fire. Using hair triggers 
Got horn relays past two nightfalls. Worked out I guess

Play rumble until you can consistently win most gunfights. 
It's 3 on xbox so I would assume it's 3 on PS4. Just started new account today 
Why not spend the time suiciding to try to get better by playing rumble or reviewing gameplay. 
Between 391 and 393 I was pretty much stuck. Seems you need to get to 394 for everything to start dropping higher. Best best is trials / raid to get higher light stuff. Once I did trials I went to 395 and am 399 now since everything actually drops higher
Dunning–Kruger effect\n\n\nCongrats on making it to the lighthouse.  
Why not use something other than No Land and a fusion rifle? Just using meta weapons will probably help you win that last game. 
Selfridges has a code for Black Friday, not sure what it is as I'm on my phone but their prices should be under $300 with the code. 
Ehh if you are decent and play them in trials it's an easy 5-0. Nice guys but not really on level of others. I did buy some of their merch as well and watch the stream 
If you are good enough then trials is the relax mode and daily crucible is the competitive mode. You have a ranking you just can't see it. If you aren't good enough for trials to be easy enough then get better. \n\nThe actual competitive scene would be the tournaments or you could do gamebattles
Do they only bag people that are streamers? I've played against all of the players in the video a decent amount and win or lose they have never bagged me or my teammates. \n\nThat said it was pretty sad to watch / listen to.
I find the most teams really abusing skorris are when you take a lead against two 2200 Elos with a carry. Then they just camp back until they get their storms each and every round. You can push but it's a 50/50 play. Just dumb because they are definitely good enough to challenge but they don't want to risk losing the game by actually playing. 
I would spend five hours grinding archons. The blue's will get you to 365, purples to 385. Then just crucible / faction packages and weekly crucible. I raided twice and was max light. Trials also drops armor randomly up to 400.
I usually ask for 70% wins and most of the time will never get a message with someone that has the win rate. Bungie.net recruitment page has actually been the most successful for me. 
Where did you order from?
Thanks for the info, will send them a tweet
Also note armor piece can be just a ghost shell. I got two this weekend 
If game shows up on Guardian gg then you get a loss. If it doesn't you got lucky. I had to reset card as well

Was watching your stream a bit, drop rate RNG is definitely somewhat ridiculous. I got mine first game after flawless on last exit. Friend played almost 100 games after flawless, gave up on getting an emblem that wouldn't be worn, and then got it on 9 wins last week. 
Skirmish plays a bit differently than trials as you need to slag to win. Trials is more about staying alive. You can also get a solo double kill by rushing into enemy and die and it doesn't really hurt you. If you did that in trials you would have an orb down where you teammates could not get. \n\nSkirmish has SBMM so you may play players more on your skill level. Trials is mainly win based so you may face higher skilled players. \n\nAs for light level it does hurt you. Enough to make a difference depends. At 385 I can survive sticky grenades and a few extra bullets. I'd also recommend probably playing blade or nightstalker. Blade has fleet footed or QuickDraw and health back on melee. Tether has shadestep and wombo. Both are more effective IMO for trials and shotgunning. 
What helped me a lot was pushing only when you have the advantage or when someone is tagged. You should push together but not next to each other. Kinda hard to explain but you essentially want to be able to see a few angles while your teammates have the angles you don't see. Skirmish is probably best bet as trials / elimination plays too slow 
The high impact scouts have the lowest ttk though if you don't miss. I only ever see mida, cocytus or badger ccl in crucible personally 
I tried to get used to palindrome as I have two accounts and having same gun would be more consistent but just can't. Not sure what it is but stick with finnalas on my main and LHF on my alt. 
If anything looking at your rumble game history you just played better people than you normally do. It takes 5-10 minutes to find a rumble match these days for me and when I do get placed there seems to be a lot larger skill gap than before. 
Yeah I stopped playing trials for about two months after First Light. One week of spooky trials would have been enough. I actually didn't mind first light but it was just dumb they would have three straight weeks of gimmick trials and then joke about it 
Yeah the hit box on TDYK is twice the size of any other hand cannon. Friend has a rangefinder / rifled / hidden hand that is so crispy 
Are you using a Matador? I find it whiffs a ton while midair and the opponent is absolute. \n\nAEGabriel mentioned his preference for party crasher for this reason
The third FWC ship is patched. I haven't gotten new monarchy ship though 
That's the thing though. I'm 1.4 y3 and 1700 Elo and consider myself average at best in trials. Maybe in general population I'm above average but compared to standard trials population I'm not. All these type of posts always say they are good / great crucible players who are above average. Once they realize they are not will be when they improve. 
If enemy starts pushing to B side you can push up on heavy side and rotate spawns. Depends on how enemy team is though. I feel I played 80% of my games from the worse spawn. And hate that heavy is much easier to get on the other side. 
If you can't at 4 then you have movement / positioning issues to fix first. 
Seems like Guardian gg has games going to rumble. Not sure if this means wins will count towards rumble grimoire or not 
RNG is RNG. Mayhem clash is the fastest and least effort to farm \n\nLast Eyasluna I got was in classic FFA
I went flawless playing only three games iirc. Damn I miss the days when people would leave when they saw flawless emblem. 
Yes anywhere from 2v6 to 4v6 is pretty normal in my experience. Sometimes it's people leaving right when flying starts sometimes it just matches straight up. Outside of clash it sucks but it's sometimes beneficial not have teammates in clash. Had a game of clash where it was 2v5 to start and we took 1700-300 lead. Teams filled and we lost by 300 in end. 
With SBMM if you got better your k/d would not really increase but your Elo would. They may not really determine your skill but anyone above 1700 in Trials will at least be somewhat competent.
I think the best way would be to do a rumble tourney. Each player plays a few games with rest of players and then you award points torwards a ranking system. Top third of players go in one group, then two other groups. With SBMM bad players could have higher wins and  k/d than a good player since they never play better opponents. 
Only thing social space is good for is knowing who you will play in first game after flawless. It's been 100% haha
This is the week I'm going to delete my PDX-45 packages. All I want is to be able to have my pulse and hand cannon next to each other so it's easier to switch mid game. \n\nSo please Bungie give me a 19 / PB / CB / RB roll so I did not wait years in vain. 
If you want LiTC it can roll smallbore and then you have 5 in the mag. It's a fun gun to use but range is just too lacking. 
It already gives over 385 but should scale slightly higher on Tuesday. Doesn't hurt to save especially the gold one as you can pick it up again 
I got it right after spring update. Maybe 700 wins? Had all emblems / ships / shaders before Taken King and had the all emblems / shaders after before getting the shader. \n\nI have an alt account with 100ish wins that got all shaders already. Everyone I play with regularly also have all embems / shaders. We all went flawless year 1, 2 and 3. 
The epic is a really solid tree and massdrop pricing is good. I'd probably take large
I faced more 2000+ Elo yesterday than I've faced the last month. My team was between 1600-1900 average. It was also all stacked teams / recoveries vs single carries. \n\nI do find matches much easier when I play with a lower skilled friend past few weeks. I want to say there has been a bit more SBMM since ROI came out as there are way more people playing trials now. 
Is S class quest rewards the same as last year? Or is there a new emblem?
You can order from U.K. Site and ship to US?
flashbang!
The hit box on TDYK is insane. I've used a ts, rf, rifled and hh one and it's super crispy on small maps. But even before this patch range was lacking and now it's way too short even with rifled / rf. I wouldn't use any roll over vendor palindrome. 
I've used The Devil You Know with TS, rangefinder, rifled and hidden hand and the hit box is insane. I do notice the range difference though vs the vendor Palindrome or my rifled finnalas. If TDYK was on my account it would probably be the only primary I used on most maps.\n\nI would use Imago in your case though, can't deal with reinforced 
From personal lfg experience win rate matters much more than k/d in terms of trials success. I've played with 1.75-2.25 players in y2 that would refuse to push orb after snipe for sole reason of wanting to get res snipe. They would finish games like 14-3 every time against bad players. Against good players they would struggle. \n\nAnother scenario would be opportunity to get res next to you or push for kill. Getting res may mean you don't get kill but that may also mean teamshooting after res and winning round. \n\nAnd with so much time accumulated for trials stats the only ones that matter now would be y3 stats. \n\n
You don't gain or lose Elo if you leave before a game. I'll switch characters if enemy score is 1200 or above and it doesn't do anything to Elo

You can one shot with a crowd control active on a Gozen-C. There was one last week with Speakers Writ from an early story mission.

If you are on xbox, all you need to do is uninstall rise of iron and then go to tower. Shaxx will be selling the older vendor hawksaw. Then reinstall and you are good to go. 
Do you get stressed from losing? Not doing well? \n\nDestiny and video games in general should be fun and to some extent relaxing. So I'd say take the game less seriously
It took me about 7 hours to level to 40 by doing all bounties and PVP / PVP quest. Fully leveled subclass in about 22 hours but a lot of that was at archons \n\nTimes are from checking active playtime via destinystatus 
I still use old vendor hawksaw. Probably just since I've used it for so long. I find blind perdition to have not enough ammo and if that is the pdx with slo12 sight than I much prefer to 19. The only aegis looks nice but I don't have any experience. \n\nI still face people using vendor hawksaw sometimes. Don't see any of the other guns but I'm pretty average.

I deleted my flawless emblem to pick up old iron banner one. I don't have it in my kiosk and it doesn't drop when you go flawless again on any character. 
Everything you'll need are the keyboard components, some solder, a soldering iron, and a screw driver.\n\nAs for tips. Get a temperature adjust able iron. And if you haven't soldered before I recommend you get some practice kits. Those are really cheap, and it would make sure you don't mess up your expensive PCB. And watch some tutorials on soldering. [EEVblog has a really in depth soldering tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Sb21qbpEQ), most of which is not even applicable to just keyboard assembly. [The Whitefox guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhfQRv8KLJU) is pretty good as well, and most of it applies to any keyboard build.
Superlux HD668B, best headphones I've ever used, but I'm not exactly an audiophile.
Always thought the Superlux looked funny, but I own a pair of ATH-700x and those look quite funny too. What pads are those? Never seen purple. Regardless, very nice combo!
Which 90* adapter is that?

Have yours held up? The leather on mine has started to crack and fall apart I have them in the same color
They don't actually match though... 
can you link me those headphone pads?\n
Phew! Thought this was one of those NSFW color matchings. Traumatized me a bit. LOL\n\nWhat's the headphones? Is it good?
beautiful :O, i like the blue one more <3
It does though :/
probably, would make acc harder though imo, try 2 orings per tapping key
i want to thank all the mods on this sub :) and remember, its a trash CAN and not a trash CANNOT ;) i'll take any of the games. 
Great release! What are your thoughts on finally being competitive in the cpu market again?

hello there
I'm down to get medals on steam 
399, thanks op!
I might've assumed (in that case sorry) but that psu isn't anywhere on the tier list (at least the better tiers) and its not that big of a brand for psus and it might not be the best to run on because of those cables (any decent one should have the cables sleeved) and it might just blow up from cheap capacitors.\n\n\nTier list for reference: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html

Yea can you make the switch the same size as the cherry mx blue wallpaper? But it looks nice

I'm about to swap the switches out of my board if you're interested
I agree, this switch tester came super quickly and the build quality is great!
some people dont bottom out too, like xilver
If you have a ton of money to spend and like an ambi shape, then the g900, but if you want to not spend a ton of money something like the nixeus revel or the g102/203 is good for cs

Replace the psu immediately, something like the Evga 650w g2, or anything from seasonic or corsair (Grey label) 
I live in California you would think we would have a big scene but it doesn't seem that way
We don't even have ketchup lays in the states, a Canadian friend brought them once and it was fantastic. 
I bet the noise from grinding is real nice looks sick
I just got shipping email for my new complete from flat face, stoked!
thanks man! looking forward to watching it :)
We just have to keep holding it down. If it becomes the new center of the hobby cool if not we still have each other and good vibes. 
As a person who got push to start, honestly don't think I would miss it if it didn't have it. It just so happens it came with the entertainment package I wanted. The mod wouldn't be worth doing unless it's less money and would also add the keyless entry. I find that part of the system more useful that the actual push to start button. But at that price tag for something that isn't OEM and doesn't  also add the cool door feature I don't see the value.\n\nIf subispeed sells it I'm sure it works, the real question is if it's worth the money and effort to install.
Man I want a blue keychain so bad! Can only find it in green : /
Setup bros!!
Best way I can describe it is it slows down time a little. Tricks flip slower and are easier to catch. 180 tricks are also more comfortable 
I never got anything from my santa : (, oh well it still felt good to give. 
It was a shot in the dark! Hopefully gets you more support with what looks like a lot of Borealis sets out there loving your work! 
Looks amazing, but for a berlinwood those trucks should for sure be a good fit maybe there's grip in between the trucks and the deck it should be a flush fit. 
They have contracts with manufacturers. The wait list is due to them taking priority in the contracts . The wait list is because they plug us in anywhere they can in the schedule but really we are lucky they even do them for us we really are small fry numbers. 
This year was my first participating but even if I don't get anything I was stoked to send someone something because really I could just buy anything I want it's not about what the gift is more that it's a nice gesture to do for someone you don't know. Like a great deal of people in this sub you are what makes this community better  this is very kind of your sir :) 
I don't know where you live but at my local park in California there's always cute girls hanging out. Probably for the weed not the tricks but still. 
As if this guy needs anymore vouching, buy with confidence his cables are very nice and made with high quality. 
White ply is best ply 
So in general a good double shot abs is seen just as good as thick pbt. You can check the sidebar for recommended places to shop. \n\nWhat you have to consider is what keycap profile , material and color/legend font. \n\nIt
So it looks like they produced more than what was preordered as we got tracking yesterday and today for the initial orders. This is super cool for folks who didn't get to get in on the initial Preorder. 
Try messing with the bios switches to see if the computer will pick it up. I know the corsairs have bios switches on the front side by the cable . If it lights up but doesn't communicate you might have a pcb failure from either static electricity or a spill. Could also just be a defect and you should contact corsair directly to see what they can do even if you don't have the receipt. 
Dude so worth it. That is probably the best case I have ever seen. 
Yup exactly like Lakers Nation, bunch of fools sitting around thinking of stuff to come up with. 
Is that an axial body?
Davinci resolve is free and even pros use it for color correction. That is what I use and it seems to work fine. 
What people who don't work in plastic don't understand is when you get a certain material right you run the production line as long as you can because the material is cheap if you don't sell it to the contract you chuck the material in the chipper to remake it into more product. I am almost certain SP has this same philosophy. \n\nSo why would they halt production of thousands for a contract to make a couple 100 sets? They don't. They just plug these GBs where they see gaps in the schedule. \n\nSo be happy they actually do the sets. In any other industry a manufacturer would look at our small fry numbers and laugh. 
It completely depends on what you preference is. Wysocki has some pretty sick color ways in stock right now\n\nBoth have great grip and are smooth as butter\n\nNo such thing as "high end" only what is more custom tailored to your preferences 
They are for people who like loose trucks, so unless you like loose trucks its not worth ordering. The bubble bushings are meant to be used without washers so that is why they look a bit too big for brts but they run fine. I personally like them and enjoy the cool colorways.  Contrary to what people are saying my stuff has always shipped the next day when stuff is in stock. 
It's pretty lit
Welcome that is a really solid choice everything is high quality out of the box enjoy!
Looks awesome!
So this is the case! Bravo dude that is insanely nice! 
dammit dude you just found me another money dump I had no idea there was a Reddit for that. But im actually really stoked to use one again.

I was negotiating one specd exactly like that and rock bottom the dealer was around 29ish with taxes, I left and they called me back the next day to ask if I thought it over because they couldn't go much lower. If you are right under true car msrp then it's a solid deal. You are right true car does not include taxes and fees so if you are at that mark OTD it's a solid deal. \n\nSince Subaru is still one of the smaller guys they don't have the margins to play with like other brands , take that into consideration. Most I have seen a dealer go is 3k and my friend happened to go to a dealer with a really motivated sales manager that day. At least in California it's like that.

OJ wheels, these have a pitbull on them with one black eye, the one swirl wheel is basically to match the pitbull. 
It's a Limited Brz with the performance pack, different brakes, wheels and dampeners. \n\nIt's going to be a hot seller it's a good deal. 
For kick flips just do an Ollie but pull your hand towards you. Play around with that and I guarantee you will start forming them
don't listen to that guy, we all start somewhere.
This is a limited with the short throw shifter and upgraded stereo/speakers, push button start and the fancy stuff. The sticker was 35k, was able to get it for 33.5k\n\nThe CVT makes the car more expensive and less of a joy to drive, it is an easy and comfortable manual even in traffic. But if you are willing to pay the price tag of the CVT there is nothing wrong with it, just get the extended warranty, A CVT trans is not cheap.
I'm jealous I wish my local stores had staggered parking spaces 
You guys need to relax! Give OP a break this is a bad quality shot I'm sure the GID material looks much better in person. \n\nI am very excited my Pok3r ,amethyst gem and my body are ready
It's a different feel, BRTs already feel really nice locking into grinds so I don't know that it's better just different and for aesthetics. 
Are you saying you have had the car for less than 2k miles!? There's no way that can be your fault without you knowing for a fact that you did something to smoke it. Let's be honest with ourselves here. Did you drive it pretty hard? If not it falls on the guy before you and should be covered 100%
Dude that is clean! Looks OEM. Great job.
Practice your front 180 landing on your front truck at 90 degrees and turning the rest of the way on the truck like a pivot. \n\nOnce you are comfortable landing on your front truck go to a place with a black top or smooth concrete where your wheels won't flat spot easy. \n\nNow do regular ollies while  coming down push down on your front truck to land on it first while pushing towards your back with your back foot. \n\nYour body should naturally want to do a backside 180 if you are following through and committing to it. \n\nBackside 180s that land on the front truck and slide the rest are steezy if you master it it's tons of fun plus it will get you comfortable making your body turn that way eventually you will be able to air the whole thing if you want to. \n\n
You picked some of the best wheels and trucks. Can't go wrong with the old faithful reds and the Alien deck should be solid. Addidas should be fine but definitely invest in some skate shoes with proper grip and support down the line it's not huge people literally skate in anything these days so don't worry about that too much. 
That was sick you have my vote
I have this kit sitting waiting for a nice day to install them it's good to see it looks good! It was a good deal couldn't pass it up. I also got the aftermarket footwells will have to see how that goes
Finally a photo that shows the legends a perfectly fine it is just a material that does not photograph well. I like it and applaud the folks behind it for having the courage to experiment  
This pic makes me look forward to getting mine, did you buy the kit plus the front piece? 
Really? Popping it compared to the 30mm with China trucks I can't even feel the difference in terms of weight if anything the new setup pops better. I guess it's all preference though 
Tao of Skateboarding is still my all time favorite 
I just built the round one with bases! Dude it's such a fun rail, all the switch up grinds are a ton of fun because it's long. 
Hit up your store on insta and ordered some pieces I'll support the scene anyway I can. 
WRX limited 17 \nShort throw shifter\nUpgraded sound and push button start\nBlind spot detection\nAll weather mats\nRear bumper appliqué \nCargo tray\n\nSticker was 35k\n\nPaid 33.5 before taxes in Southern California\n\nPut 5k down\n\n\nI shopped around for the loan quite a bit. Dealer ended up beating the best rate I got from a credit union. Ended up at 3% for 72 months(I have always been a 60 month kind of guy but considering this car will be getting less than 10k miles on it a year I decided to stretch it.)   \n\nI have to mention it was the 3rd Subaru dealer I visited, the other two either had unreal markups "because demand" on wrxs or weren't willing to go down at all from sticker.\n\nTrue car is a great tool and don't be discouraged if the first place you visit doesn't want to play ball. Based on TrueCar I knew what I was asking wasn't unrealistic. So stick to your ground. 
Held with clips and drilled in with self tapping screws 
I have been in the market for one, traditionally dealers have been going down around 2k USD under MSRP from what I have seen on TrueCar but that is plus all the fees. I don't think Subaru in general is one of those brands that you can haggle a ton. But if the price is right and you get a good rate on the loan it is all you can ask for. 
Bruh...... Just amazing.\n\nAlso it's literally the best rail ever to trick out of, the extra surface is so key. 
Here is my submission, been really enjoying playing around with obstacles lately.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Tszt8B8nB3Q
The trucks kept coming loose but A small drop of super glue fixed it. \n\nThese setups really are to figure out what size and shape I prefer before I spend real money on a permanent setup. \n
Yours is super clean I'm jelly of the blue bottom ply. I want to get this one scratched up my top and bottoms are white. 
Not that I know of, besides Black river in Berlin and Mike's store I don't know of any brick and mortar stores. Everything is online
Yes sir!

Game over boys lets just sticky this one no other collection can stack up to this. Well done sir.

The plys are nice, wood black wood black wood\n\nIt's a pretty mellow shape though, I'm liking the deeper concave more 
The silver with red mud flaps actually looks decent, now it has me debating. 
Normally not a fan of the exterior emblem overlays but this one is subtle and looks good. I think I like it because it still has blue in it.  Sweet ride.
It's a dolphin flip in skateboarding, I'm calling it the Vodca flip
Two door handles from the hardware section, they come with hardware included. \n\nA piece of pine wood that I cut and spray painted grey to use as bases. \n\nDrill holes into the bases making sure you drill  areas for the heads of the hardware so the base sits flat\n\n\n\nThat's really all it is. I might make an album the next time I make one if people really want a "how to". 
Also right there with you but there is still time left : )
I would say yellow trucks and white wheels that have the world logo on them
Your statement put out negative vibes as if everything you have seen to this point wasn't "good". \n\nIf your are going to do the childish tried and true "say something negative then try and argue that it's not negative" narrative we see right through it here but nice try. 
I wouldn't do the rip and dip board for reasons already mentioned, the trucks are great but you could go with better wheels. I feel like I'm paying for the brand when I get spitfires and unless you get the expensive formula they flat spot easy. OJ's wheels are my jam currently 
Real 8.25\nIndependent high 149s\nOJ 53mm wheels\nBones white hardware\nMOB grip with a White Vader stencil sprayed on

+1 for the glorious good price and excellent surface. Smooth but also controlled 
You would be surprised at how quickly you adapt to using modifiers, it really isn't that much less efficient. I personally love 60%. 
I agree Chub is slayin, I'm happy he's been blowing up and getting noticed 
Just get a hohmwrecker g2, does kanthal tc, well built, and none of those screen issues. 
Well that's your problem right there, trying to fit massive coils in the recoil. I use a 3mm bit and it works just fine, even with aliens
yeah it does take a look at it
Good job on getting the recoil, it's a pretty damn good rda for a first purchase\n
Same, I basically have to now because of driving. Goon LP is just pretty flavorless, and there are very few squonk RDAs out there that seem appealing. Might go for a tsunami 24 and see if it has better flavor. Hadaly is cool but again, I don't really wanna run a single coil. Might be good though. I don't see why they can't make every RDA squonkable, it's really not that hard and would open up a lot of options. 
Depends on the ccd of the stick.
That's my problem with a lot of box mods. Stab woods are cool, but they're usually way too expensive and are lipo only (seriously, I want to be able to change batteries if I want) and most other mods either look like decepticon dildos or just... ick. Just someone out there (hohmtech) needs to make a plain looking box mod that kicks ass. 
Eh do you. I can vape 6 and enjoy it, but I chainvape all day at work (smoke store) and I don't like getting nicsick. But if it works, do it man. I had a guy who vaped 18mg in a cleito. (he did eventually move down to 6 though)
Dang, the good sales end a day before I get paid. Still gonna use that double order one, and get a bunch of juice!
Thanks man
If you really want to make "advanced" coils, I wouldn't suggest ss. I'd go with nichrome and kanthal
That may be all YOU need, but I try to get as far away from cigarette mtl hits as I can. I've vaped on a nautilus and it BLOWS. not clouds, just is a terrible piece of crap. Just my opinion, not gonna downvote you because you're free to like that garbage if you like. 
What beige is that? 
yeah that's true, but I need to upgrade the rest of my computer as well. 
^basically this. The Juul is debatably the best cigalike, but it blows all of the other ones out of the water. Going to get my best friend and I some juuls, when that "I really need nicotene now" craving hits. 
Yeah doode, hope you can keep of the cigs
Never tried and TBD juice, but the watermelon cooler sounds right up my alley. Anything citrus is amazing! 
I don't own any of them, but we sell the vape pen 22 at my work (cig store, so barely any vape stuff) and it in fact does come with replacement glass. If you like high nic I'd just go with that, but if you want to have a more conventional sub ohm experience I'd go with the v8. Not quite sure how the brit tank stacks up against them, though. 
Right on dude! you won't regret it! 
See that is something i myself don't use. It baffles me that people are able to get along without anything smaller than a 60... I need arrow keys for gaming, diamond nav would be the worst. 
You might be right there... since it has 3 wick slots
just... why? 
Same, except I had to get some Highlander Palisade from the B&M near me, when I was out. Ordered another 120ml though, and will order another one when I get paid. 
Trade verified!
loved the original one, miss it. II looks dope. good luck everyone!\n
Go buy some preclaptoned kanthal or make your own claptons. It's not hard, and you can make more wire than the strings will for around the same price. Don't destroy your lungs\n\nSource: been playing guitar for 5 years and also vape, don't vape anything or vape ON anything that is not meant to be vaped. 
On their website it shows you how you could do a single coil. But I'm not entirely sure why someone who bought the tfv12 would want to use it for a single coil...
I would enter this one if I weren't broke from getting a Doom cap. Good luck everyone
What have you had in the past as far as tanks?
Oh it totally is man.

People shit on the homhwrecker all the time, I don't know why it's a good consistent vape, feels nice, and TC on Kanthal DOES work, if you get it to work. It's cheaper than most dna200s with lipos so I don't get it. 
I just can't really think of any mechs off hand that are even really sub $100. Yeah I really don't understand the hype behind the magicforce anyways, it's a terribly ugly keyboard, you get what you pay for. Only keycaps that look good are SA and GMK (and even SA I don't like, but out of all the profiles and types it would be a second for those who like that kind of stuff) \n\nEDIT: What I would personally go for if I had to go for a sub $50 mech would to scout ebay for a Dell AT101W. Sure they're beige, but they have good switches and pretty decent keycaps. They certainly are miles better than any cheap cherry clone board with terrible keycaps you can get floating around out there. 
Honestly if the v2 just had an option to squonk (which I do now) i'd buy it immediately. Even if that was the only difference. Goon LP has about 0 flavor compared to it
Yeah. Just get a spool of 26/28ga kanthal/nichrome and clapton with 36ga/40ga kanthal/nichrome. Better flavor for sure, and making a clapton wire takes about 30 seconds including making them and making the coils out of them. 
IMO that stuff is not sour in the slightest. 
Probably. A lot of people seem to really like it here, and i've had a customer come in with one and like it as well. That's about as good as it gets for prefab coils
Well that's at least a start... 
While I highly appreciate your response in it's technical observation, I was more asking as far as flavor and ease of construction go. I don't taste kanthal as anything other than a yummy vape, so I guess it doesn't matter that much to me either way, but I guess I will probably go for nichrome because I do like the quick ramp up. 
I mean that's pretty fair to say goon and the tm. I like all three, personally. The recoil just has a the type of draw and flavor I like in a vape. 
As long as the quality is good (no shine through like TA) I don't care when they come. I've been waiting for burgandy/purple sets to come, and this one is excellent. This will be my first ever full gmk kit and I don't think I could have chose a better one
PGA= Pure grain alcohol. No killawatts is the brand. It's a local juice from Denver that is sold in a number of B&M, and because of the pure grain alcohol (which is meant to evaporate) it lasts about a hit and a half dripped fresh. 
Yeah but remember, when someone asks for "x,y,z" and you suggest "w", even if W is miles better than the others, they don't want it. Sad but true, I myself would go with none of those either
Man, where do you get that assessment? I know that they are not the most common, but I didn't think that they were that rare? 
I'd say so. I've vaped on a variety of juices and only minty/very sour ones I taste on inhale, and that's usually not even much of a taste more of a throat hit. 
I'd suggest a thorough knowledge of ohms law, and further than that, basic knowledge of juices and setups, from crappy egos with 18mg juice all the way to the finest dna mods with good juice. 
just says 5700 when I check specs...
just give me an example
Are you me?
neat
And then you end up wasting a bunch of cotton that could have wicked 3-4 builds and you feel like a moron
MCV Cherry Bomber
Same. I'm still on this rig. Gonna be saving up this year, hopefully I can go for some dual 1080ti's
Maybe it's time to get an RDA? I find I use much less juice a day than tanks... also if your juice has PGA in it (Killawatts) it vaporizes faster and goes faster. 
I can do it, it's just 3 am, dark, and I am tired. Will do when there is light out
CM wants you to buy the whole keyboard... it's just like how realforce/topre won't make high profile keycaps by themselves, so you have to buy a $300 keyboard just for the caps. 
http://imgur.com/a/4qJBM There you are man! Kinda shit photos but it most certainly is the real deal
And here I am with 67g clears, and I bottom out all the time. Guess I'm just heavy handed. My hands only feel sore after 8+ hours of gaming
Pretty much once every 5 minutes as long as I am awake. I vape a ton. Especially at my computer and even more so at work, much less doing anything else. 
Thanks man! Geeze, do they need my ssn too? /s 
about weekly. I rewick about every 3-4 days. I vape all day at 135 watts though, so I have to change it often so it doesn't end up tasting like garbage. 
nichrome and kanthal. SS is good too but I like more complex builds 
Well I honestly don't know what to tell you that will meet your demands in your price range. As far as I can tell, there are no tanks that are truly leak proof, but I know that the smok tfv4 is a pretty good option. As far as the mod itself, you could get the smok koopor primus, that's like $40 and is a pretty decent bang for your buck, you'd have to buy two batteries as well. If you truly want something that does not leak, you will have to get an rda. 
I think I'd just go with the first suggestion of the Dell AT101W. They are mostly beige and old looking, but they have a modern ansi layout and a superior keyfeel to any other used board or clone switch board you will encounter for $50. Good luck man 
If you're looking for mint, and not overpowering juices, I'd suggest B-X vapor's Honey Suckle My Cuke and Watermelon Crack. Both are light, minty, fruity, delicious. 
It's not really hard, the hard part is actually getting hours there. My friend has had jobs at two vape shops and neither of them gave him even part time... 
recoil
MX only? 
Oh don't worry, I check geekhack all the time for stuff, and there are a couple Orion boards on there right now actually, just MX unfortunately (still would love to have one)
Probably the magicforce? Not sure though, it's hard to find a good mech for under a couple hundred IMO but I also have pretty high standards 
I guess I could try that, but I really don't want to have to reset until I get a cube of meat... and I'm pretty sure the ball of bandages doens't show up in greed mode. 
Looking specifically for a Ti Goon + cash, but I will entertain offers of all kind as long as they are good, so offer accordingly. \n\nEdit: Looking for $175 OBO
I happen to work at a cigarette store. I got an old man a while ago who brought in a coupon for some money off some marlboros. I looked at it, seeing that it was completely square (unlike most that are rectangular) and had to inform him that it was in fact, for Circle K. I told him sorry, we don't accept coupons for other stores. He proceeded to berate me, telling me he will never go to this store again.\n\nIt's not like I'm getting paid commission to sell you packs, maybe you should look at the coupon. 
>under $130
Having worked in a cigarette store, it's because smokers not only kill themselves with it, but they're cheap bastards too. Also, in a lot of cartons of Marlboros they have 50c off coupons in the packs. I will have customers bring me a dozen and I have to scan each pack individually, then the coupon. So they can save 5 bucks on a 56 dollar carton of already complete garbage cigarettes. 
Only sour vape I've had is blu razz by northland vapor. Not very sweet, but has a nice sourish throat hit. It's pretty decent
Buying a bunch of flavors only 1-2 of which is good, then your stuck with a bunch of lame shit. Anyone want a northland nuts and cream? It has a distinct "sour bile" aftertaste. 3mg max vg 120ml with maybe a couple drips taken out before I got sick of it. 
The Sun Type 7 is really cool, as it can do all sorts of fancy characters... but yeah, for me, you need something with more feedback and sturdiness for gaming 
https://youtu.be/pFWJI-eVL58
*not terribly ugly* \n*under $50*\nChoose one
From what I understand the petri RTA is pretty dang good with the flavor. I use the tfv8, has good flavor and clouds, but some may say the flavor isn't the greatest. Also gg some jerk had to downvote everyone's opinions, nice. 
I have a snowwolf 200w, be right back with pics! \n\nEdit: Apparently left my phone at work... pictures tomorrow
I do not have experience with the hohmslice, but I do have the hohmwrecker G2. They all have fantastic build quality, and they do IN FACT do temp control on kanthal. I'd get one if I didn't vape over 100 watts constantly:D only thing I don't like about their mods is the ohm, male, and female symbols on it. They are hand cheese magnets, if they made a plain metal one I would buy 5 of em.
It was at least a couple months ago. Oh really? well good, they're pretty shit at customer support, considering my wrecker was DOA. They still replaced it for free though, which is nice. 
anything more complex than a normal fused claptons. 4 core aliens, staple stagger fused, ect. It gets more complex from there
pics?
I myself would recommend Watermelon Crack by B-X vapor. It's watermelon and mint, sounds weird but it is beyond fantastic. Great prices too! 
right on dude\n
Good luck finding nixdorfs. They are pretty much near impossible to find. They can't really be that much better than vintage blacks, can they? 
Yeah dude...
I mean I'd say it's pretty good, considering I'm on a HD 5700... I'd kill for your graphics card
What atomizers are better than the recoil? Serious question as someone who has tried a lot of them, and owns at least 5 others. Cause that one tastes fantastic and is super easy to drip. 
Continuous Discharge Current: Basically you want to have a build that pulls under the CCD of amperage on the battery, of which I do not know. 
Recoil
The build you described is incredibly beefy. Most of the crazy builds going in there have their core round wires as 28 ga and less. I'd recommend going down to 28, .4 ribbon, and 36/40 wrap.
I'm guessing you probably can't replace it, because Corsair uses a non-standard bottom row. It looks like all of those novelty caps are meant for standard size bottom row, shifts, and enter. 
I have seen it, unfortunately it is not alps. Otherwise I would be on it like white on rice
Don't like the texture on it at all. 
The funniest thing about this is the company, 22nd century, already makes cigarettes called Red Sun. They claim to have the highest nicotene, and I don't know if that's true, but the cost the same price as American Spirits but taste like literally nothing. They're not even bad enough to be disgusting (looking at you pall mall, pyramid) but cost the same price as "premium" cigarettes. We don't sell any at my store
Thinking about guns is basically illegal in NY.
Seriously! Think of that luck... picked the wrong mother fucker.
Something like that.
 "Punnani" that means he killed a man. It's street slang. I'm a cop and have been one for a very long time. 
I just bought a poker 3 today with blues. Kinda wanted something with greens but not wanting to wait for a wasd 61 key barebones to come in stock again... and that means I can buy that later. :)\n\nDear god this hobby is addicting. 
LAST SHIPMENT OF ANY GUN EVER. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!
Looks like a lugged bike frame.
Brovary is a large suburb city north east of Kiev. 
>dampening key clacks\n\nWat.
Never heard of IO aks. Interesting.
Well you inspect it at the FFL it's shipped to, and once you complete the transfer, you cannot return it. If it's not up to your expectations/defective, reject receipt of the item. That's pretty standard practice in the gun world actually. 
I think so. Stay away m8.
Broperator.
You're a braver man than I to sink 1.5k into hipoints.
I'm trying to get my friend to understand this who is new to firearms as well. The election cycle has a HUGE impact on guns. When Obama got elected again, I knew people who were traveling state to state looking for ammo...
My hhkb just came in the mail not 10 minutes ago... off to try!
All I use Alexa for now is controlling my lights and the weather/time/playing my Amazon prime music. Although I'm really considering ending paying for prime as well.\n\nI could get a google home and a Spotify subscription and probably be just as happy (if not more so). \n\nThe need for the questions to be so damn formulaic is what kills it for me. Google home seems a lot better at being able to listen to a question and figure out what you want. 
You carry an empty gun? 
Best part is, it's just a glock in a roni.
Is this revision 1 or 2? I have the 1 and while I like/d it the lack of a function layer and hardware bound arrow keys killed it for me.
What's the OAL of the pistol with the KAK blade?
Are there no arrow keys on the hhkb??? I thought you could use the arrows with a function modifier of sorts. Do you just need physical dedicated arrow keys?
Buy: S&W M&P Sport II\n\nBuild: Go to palmetto state armory's website and have fun!

Sounds badass, I'll have to check the other kinds of quadcopters out. 
I take the multi and magnesium in the morning before eating, and the rest with dinner later in the day. 
I always thought this fact was odd as well.
I'm mostly interested in arial photography/videography. I've been very happy with the camera on the DJI Phantom 3 standard, I bet the other models would just be unreal. 
Lol, ouch.
Yeah sounds like the v2 then. Nice!
How?
https://imgflip.com/i/19gdxl
That's some beautiful stuff.\n
>owns 12 hipoints.\n\nWat.
This is exactly right. Plugs in the ears underneath active muffs. Like you said they'll block out sounds like guns firing (mostly) while amplifying talking and other quieter sounds. It allows you to hear almost naturally while not hearing the crack of gunfire. It's pretty sweet.
Ah, gotcha. The full apex kit for an M&amp;P, springs, bars, and new trigger itself is $170 iirc. Your paint job looks pro tho. I'd be afraid to do that, but you dun good.
That's actually pretty cool. What did a 12 pack of hipoints cost?
!!

Noted, thanks for the tip. 
That killer hook, "новый год" - they are singing about the new year. 
LOL, about the exact opposite. Well, hopefully I just got the crappy interactions out of the way early. 
I would rather not risk having uninformed police try something like seizing my brand new quadcopter. 
What do you carry the shield in? Or do you not?
Very cool, thanks for the fast reply. The more I feel the PBT caps... I may need to pick up a set of pbt blanks for the poker now. 
So you have arrows?
большой самовар!
How do keycap sets even come to be purchased anyways? I missed the latest granite release... really really want a set.
That's perfect, thank you!
I wish they did different keycap profiles.
What's it like to get an AR in Canada?
I cannibalized an old USB mini cable, shortened it, and gave it a nice braided sleeve and put some heat shrink tubing on the ends. Not as nice as a professionally made one, but looks nice and works great. I may have gone a bit over the top with the heat shrink tubing. 
Yikes. 
"One is never enough." Too true, too true...
Gotta get some of that super male vitality, yo. He always sounds like he's about to keel over whenever he says "super male vitality." It comes out in such a hurried lumped together mess.
They are all the same when it comes to stuff like that. I bet there will be more chances to buy Iraqi contractor AKs. 
How did you know it was updating?\n\n*begins to furiously restart my tap*
Because that was хлеб, not бутерброд.
Yes.
It looks like half of a dead albatross on her head.
Pm'd
Does anyone know of a way to "force" the update?
Also the knee pads on the outside of the ankles. Super high speed low drag.
Could you explain this theory?
This worked great, thank you!
Holy shit. Mad tv, Ms swan... Flashbacks
Might as well mention the fact that Hillary Clinton is a subterranean lizard person. Ever seen Hillary Clinton at night after the sun goes down, or anywhere there aren't those large production lights? Nope, didn't think so. She's a cold blooded reptile. Her campaign's stage lights are actually heat lamps from petsmart. 
I agree. I'm falling more and more out of love with Alexa daily as she can't answer simple questions. I think I may end up replacing her with a google home. 
this is a total test to see who is the ultimate weekendgunnit warrior. If you see gun, you made the cut, if you see mspaint, atf will come pew your pupper. \n
Here's also the option to buy it at a brick and mortar store. Bestbuy for example carries them. 
Just bought a board a few months ago with browns and I'm not really totally in love with them. Needed something quiet-ish though- so it works. The bump is there but I really hammer the keys with my fingers because I barely feel it unless I type very slowly. \n\n
They look like juggalos. 
Thats a good point. I will use "quadcopter" if anyone tries to have a reasonable conversation with me. The connotation is much more benign.
Actually no, you're conflating "therapy dogs/emotional support animals (usually dogs)" and "service animals." \n\nESAs are protected under the FHA and they are allowed to fly with their owner. Other prohbitions such as entering establishments which serve food/drink, etc are still enforced and you cannot take an ESA into such a place.\n\nService animals are highly trained to help a patient with a specific task or provide certain medical function for the patient. 
You're right. Where is his stab vest.
> Hopefully over 26", otherwise he's rocking an illegal SBR with that foregrip on there. Although it does look like a 16" barrel on there so I'm not totally sure what all is going on.\n\nThis is why. Although, I think it would be an illegal AOW, not SBR.

Rumble in the Bronx. God tier jackie chan movie. Shit, I gotta watch that now. 
Is it as simple as flipping the space bar on a cherry mx board? Sorry if this is a really silly question.
I'm talking about an "oh shit" moment where you need some emergency detent pins or other small parts. I agree majorly though, I wouldn't buy most AR parts on Amazon even if they had them. Just thought it was nice to be able to get little things with prime shipping as needed. \n\nMagpul on Amazon? Not even once.
I've stood in that exact spot. 
[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/243/)
I think this is what she was actually getting at. Like come on, if I were going to use it to spy on people, would I be standing in a public area with a giant fucking grin on my face?
That's not a WASR 10. Wasr's don't have mag dimples. They have plates welded inside the mag well instead. \n\nGood try though. 
>don't waste your vote.\n\nAmen. As great as a 3rd party candidate would probably be for certain things - the fact is America has a two party system. Third party candidates simply cannot win in this environment. And I know you'll say "well with thinking like that they can't" but that's the problem. The majority of the country doesn't think that way or doesn't care. Don't waste your vote. 
*notice me senpai*
$230?!!?!
If you're new to mag supplements watch out for diarrhea. If it occurs try starting on a lower dose of mag. I started originally at 500mg and it was terrible. I cut it in half and still get relief from pain, without the bathroom issues. 
This. Angled foregrips are good though, I do believe. 
Noob here, what are these googles I've seen mentioned? I watch the video feed on my iphone in the holder on the controller. 
Already sorted. 250mg mag ox gives me no GI trouble.
Where are numpads?
Looks like it may be part of either a chair/table (a leg) or maybe a post from a bannister? Is it wood?
Service animals are not the same as ESAs. And you're right, ESAs aren't. Actual legitimate prescribed service dogs are. \n
RIP
If you're sinking money like that into the gun, why not just buy a better gun to begin with. Apex trigger kits aren't cheap. 
I'll never unsee that, thanks. 
don't forget his dog.
Cool.\nI'm waiting for a 55g dome sheet.\nI was thinking of getting either the 84 or the 75 but I prefer to have grouped function keys, so I ended up with the regular TLK version.\n\nI'm really satisfied with the build quality.\nReally sturdy and dense plastic. An even with the 35g switches the feels are awesome. Can't wait to try the 55g domes since they're closer to my old blues.
Noice!!!\n\nPlums FTW.\nWhat weight? 
The black/white + carbon wrap turned out really well, great board!
Labeled as "GSF" on PMK.
What's the color on those modifiers?
Yup, basically the perfect layout for my tastes. 45g weight. 
Plum is 100+$\n\nBut yeah. Warm recommendation
I had a 410 at work. Afterward I got a 430 then an 440. I was appalled with the 440. 410/420 way by far superior and 430 was quite similar except it was island type. But similar to feel to 410/420. I asked to have my old 430 refurbished and pimped out and I'm using it now.\n\n\nUnfortunately I'm going to need a 32gig laptop soon. And it's a bummer the new ones are poop. Good thing I have a Plum87 incoming for work so that the co-workers will stop bitching about my blues. \n\n\n\nAs gor the series. T is best price to quality to performance. At least for me.\n\nW is too bulky. X is too flimsy and small. 430 w/ extended battery a perfect.
I bring blues to work. Cause fuck them all! 
I'm afraid I don't understand...
Nice very light and comfortable. But I'm fitting a 55g domes when they arrive. I just can't get my precision moving from Blues to them. I guess I'm a heavy typists after all.\n\nAnd I'm starting to like the realforce font on the Plum.\n\nThe complete lack of branding is awesome.
Exactly!
me neither thanks
That's a T520, \npretty old laptop if you ask me and it has kept the design queues from old IBM thinkpads.\n\nNewer gen Lenovo ThinkPads (sans the T series) are crap if you ask me. Especially the new keyboards.\nLast good keyboard on a T series was on the Tx30 generation. Newer generations have the same keyboard look, but much worse feel.\nTx10/20/30 series were one of the best feeling non mechanical keyboards I've tried.
Hmmm didn't know. I guess. :D  \n\nEdit:\nNot that I've read about it. I kinda agree. I usually prioritize productivity over ritual.\n\nI usually clear my desk in the morning, and untill the end of the day it's filled with coffee mugs, fruit, pens, random stuff. And each day it's the same. \n\nCan't be fussed to keep it the wai it's in the morning since there is stuff that needs to be done. :)
Several years ago I stopped using IDE-s (because of a shitty underpowered PC) and went with the terminal + code editor route, and not I'm at the point that I'm more proficient with my tools separated like this.\n\nMy daily driver setup is VSCode and Terminator (split views are a life saver) and I wouldn't change it for anything.
As an owner of a bully I can confirm they are build as bulldozers and have a mentality of a one.\n\nAlso stubborn like hell, and uncannily agile.\n\nAlso. Best dogs ever.\n\n\n
Well one letter one voice is a characteristic from all southern Slavic languages (sans Bulgarian).\n\nLatin transcript of the letter њ would be nj.
Sure thing.\nThere are currently 3 sets of blanks.\n\nFree shipping Dsa keycaps blank printed 108 thick pbt for mechanial keyboard Dsa profiles  blank mx switch gaming keyboard\n http://s.aliexpress.com/mqMrQB3e \n(from AliExpress Android)\n\n\n\n\nblank DSA keycaps for mx mechanical keyboard 104keys 87keys\n http://s.aliexpress.com/amaIBvua \n(from AliExpress Android)\n\n\nAnd printed ones, but are kinda pricey and not that nice looking\n\n\n \n150 keys PBT Perfect Arc Spherical Keycap White Radium vulture Cherry MX switch keycaps for  Mechanical Gaming keyboard\n http://s.aliexpress.com/rEBvaeMv \n(from AliExpress Android)\n\n
So I decided to pull the trigger and get a EC keyboard.\nAnd I can say I didn't make a mistake.\n\nThis puppy feels sublime. \nIt's quite light compared to my old Outemu Blues, but much much smoother and comfortable.\n\nIt's gonna need some time getting used to the lightness but the coworker are gonna be glad that the blue is out of the office. :)\n\nAlso the shoe is Nike Limited Edition Swoosh Sporting club.\nThe knife is Victorinox Rangergrip 61.\n\nAs for the keyboard, native n-key rollover and the media keys are pretty nice. \n\nThe keycaps are extremely thick PBT, and a lower profile than OEM and Cherry keycaps.\n\nThey make a nice quite *THOCK* and a very comfortable to type on. Love the rebound on the switches. They're dental-banded and the tactility is different from Cherry MX.\n\nThey're not linear, nor they're sharply tactile like the blues. More of a smooth resistance. And I'm really digging it.\n\nThe case is really sturdy, and it's textured, so no fingerprints magnet here. Love that there are no logos apart from on the space bar, but since I use it flipped I don't care about the ugly logo.\n\nOver all. \nUntil I get my hands on a Realforce 87, this is by far the best feeling keyboard I've tried. \n\nFeels much nicer than CK Novatouch.\n\nAny more questions feel free to ask them. :)
Just order a china board off AliExpress and be golden!
Sweet. Thanks for the reply.\n\nThey don't look OEM. They look quite sculpted.\n\nBummer that they're not PBT.\nAlso, what do you think of the sound they make?
From eBay.\nIt's from the Korean rebranded version . 18$.\n\nI think it's a well worth an upgrade.\n\nCurrently waiting on them. And I'll probably post a review when I get some more time.\n\nThing I can compare it to are outemu blue's and IBM buckling springs and 35g plums and novatouch 45g.\n\nAlso I found a tutorial from some korean dude on YouTube that is pretty detailed. \n\n\nI also saw some reviews of the dome swapped versions and people day it's a massive upgrade, more pronounced tactile point and faster rebound.\n\nAnd apparently the Korean domes are pretty solid.
Call the case Dragonaut if you ever push it to production. :)\n\nNo need to thank me. :)
Buckling Spring.
There's a older cheaper version. I think it's called Quickfire TK
I'm gonna rock the 35's for some  time to see how they feel.\nI will deff get at one point a 55g dome from korea and try it out.
Hansung sell official plum components. But yeah. It's the hansung one.
I think some two-three weeks or so.
Looks sweet.\n\n35g?\n\nI'd like to slap some sculpted spherical keys no mine, but I'm digging the retro stock look of it. :D\n\nAnd the stock keys are actually pretty damn good!\nQuite low in profile and needs some getting used to it.\n\nAs for keycaps, I think my endgame would be HiTop Topre TKL keyboard.\n\nI kinda never want to go back to MX keys now. :D
Pffff. Only Das?\n\nPeasant...
Will post a mod log if and when I decide to do it. :)
T430 also uses island style keyboard but it eons better then next gen. Quite tactile with nice travel. 
I was planning on buying white with blue switches\n\nGuess I'm gonna wait a couple more days then
Shots fired :D\nhahahaha, \n\nIMHO, I was worried they'd feel like browns, with kinda of a mushy tactile point, but no, you don't feel the tactile point, but they don't feel the same as Cherry linears.\n\nIt's strange, and I love it.\n\nAnd the complete lack of wobbling on the keys\nIt's perfect.\n\nIf a topre clone feels this good, I'm not gonna try a Realforce keyboard because I would by it at the same moment.
Link for the zoidberg keycap pls.\n\n\nI need it. Cause reasons...
There are still a lot of TK here where I live.\n\nBut yeah. Masterkeys is nice. And M looks like the unicorn.\n\nI'm bummed that they don't have the basic non backlit TKL. I dislike RGB, and lighting in general. Pointless​ for me, since I touch type. \n\n\nAlso, I'm I the only one that prefers the grouped function keys vs condensed?\n\nThat's one of the main features I like about TKLs, apart from the compactness.
They are quite nice when you get used to the low profile.\n\nThe spacebar is kinda shitty and bent. Hence why I swapped it.
Well great, now I'm even more impatient waiting for them. :( \n\nGee thanks :P\n\nI really like the feel of capacitive switches compared to classical switches. The more "natural" tactile bump is awesome, but I think the best thing is the rebound of the keys. \n\nAnd the sound. Oh dear lord, I didn't believe that a silenced keyboard would make such a good sound. \n\nMy plum came pre-silenced and it feels amazing. Just *thock* *thock* *thock* *thock*. The tactility is fine and different but when you get used to it's the best feeling ever. and I've read that 55g's feel super for their tactility. That's what made me get a dome swap. \n\nIf almost linear 35g feel this good, I can't wait to find out how good 55g feel.
As a MTB rider, I can vouch that this applies to both bikes and keyboards.\n\nOr any hobby...
Plums (Topre clones) are also fully programmable.
I'm worried because of the sculping on the keycaps. I'll probably make a template to trace with a fine tip on a dremel.\n\nI'm just interested if someone has tried it.

VS Code has pretty swell startup times. \nI'm more glad because of the proper code formating features.\n\nAlso a hard core ex Sublime user here. \nGreat thing is, I made the switch easy by adding the sublime keymap.
Not a problem. :)\n\nBasically, Plum is Noopoo's child company for capacitive switches, and all topre clones are made by them. And other companies just re-brand their stuff.
We also have the same deal.\nSomething like a trade agreement with china.\n\nPretty kickass.
Wow they look amazing!\n\nI might order them if the price isn't totally insane?
All depends. I don't like the small form factor, since I prefer TKL keyboards. So I would say classic Realforce 87.\nBut if you're looking for good programmability you can go with a Plum 87. Swap the dome for a 55g and if you don't like the low profile keys you can easily swap them for something else since the plum topre clones are MX compatible. Also nice lube on the switches is apparently good.\n\nThe switches are already dental bandended on the 35g version I have and they feel pretty damn good.\n\nI'm currently waiting on a 55g some sheet since I'm more used to higher weight.
I love the sound of my laser profile pbt's.\n\nI'm waiting for a plum 87 to arrive to see how good the sound and feel is on the stock keycaps.\n\nBut I would like some retro console font on a nicely sculpted keycaps.
Are you by any chance from the States?
It's quite and thocky.\n\nI got used to it moving from outemu blues to 35g in about a week.\n\nToday I did a test, and top score was 127wpm, 97% acc, still make some mistakes but I ha e to say, it's eons better than mx like switches.\n\n\nAt one point, I'm def getting a Realforce 87.
Sorry, I thought you were referring to the keyboard.\n\n\nAnd yeah, the fidget cube helps concentrate a lot.\n\nAt least for me as a software developer.\n\n\nNo more destroying pens.
Extend the back of the case and make a cable compartment, and use the wristrest as cover. Super minimal.
I'm not that i to linears.\n\nBlues were the life for me, but now. Topre, topre is life!!!\n\nClears would be to hard IMHO.\n\nI mainly use mechs because hand pain. So for now, I like the 35g domes.\n\nBut would love to try 55g domes.\n\nMight do a dome swap at one point.
Co-workers constantly ask me how did I manage to retrofit a commodore keyboard to usb. And mine doesn't even look that old. :(
Actually it's a tiny desk, and most of the stuff were temporary on it. It's mostly clear. But the main thing is that none of the stuff are aligned since it's easier for me use them at an angle. Which drive my co worker crazy since he need everything to be inline. 
Why would you assign bold to old? 
No idea man. \nThey come stock on non-RGB plums.\n\nIt's a pretty good keyset. The profile differs from both cherry and OEM.\n\nThe top rows are the same profile like cherry but bottom rows are really shallow. It's an interesting keyset. \n\nAnd I like it even more since it uses realforce font, and yet is MX stem.
Belgrade present.\n \nDidn't believe there's anyone except select few that are crazy enough to be here\n:)
Any China board with kalih blue's. You can find them sub 50$ on Ali.
Really nice.\nI like the feel of my 35g domes, but I can't type as fast or as comfortable as my old blue's. So I'm swapping them for a 55g domes.\n\nApparently it feels like a whole new switch.
Make the wrist rest the top lid of the keyboard. 2-1
Bummer man. :(\n\nI can't imagine losing my bully. That has to be tough. You need a nother pupper to help carry his torch.
Similar, but this one is angled, so in a way better IMHO.
Yeah\n I really want to try an electro capacitive keyboard, and the plum was a good deal. \n\nCan't wait for it to arrive. And I'm really digging the retro look of it.\n\nI'm gonna try it with 35g domes that are stock. And if I don't like it I will order a 55g dome that is more like the current mx blues that I love.
That's mine and it was 80$ but 25$ shipping.
Go to [wasd,](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set.html) oder custom keycaps with prints, boom.\n\nThank me later, name your first child after me.
That's and interesting profile.\nDoesn't look like OEM.\nCan you do a side pic of the profiles. And are they PBT or ABS?
Good cheap torpe-like board.\n\nI like it more than the novatouch I've tried. It was a blind buy, and it was amazing. Best impulse buy ever!
As a Serbian I'm glad to see one of our historical flags.\n\nMy personal favorite is the flag of the Serbian Principality\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Serbian_flag_1839.jpg
I've switch ti arch for some 2ish years. And in the end went back to mint. Main reason was the lack stability to me. \n\n\nWhich is shame, because I liked arch really well, but the latest version of Mint kicks ass.
I've just got my Topre clone, and I can say, I fell in love instantly. \n\nI went from 55g blues to 35g topre clones.\nGetting used to them, but I have to say, they feel amazing.\n\nDifferent kind of tactile to be honest, but I'm liking them more than my blues. \n
Jeebus.\nThat's amazeballs!\n\n\nNice job.\nAlso, jelly for the hiPro caps.
The dude is amazing.\nWould love to see him review more keyboards.\n\nI always listen to his reviews while working. :)
Most if it is the cinnamon stability. Ive run into some stability with other distros. But de facto, cinnamon is my favorite graphical frontend. I've tried mos of mainstream alternatives and always return to cinnamon.
1436.\n\nHe was a good man. God rest his liver.
I have pretty big hands. And only Genius Ergo 8800 was big enough for me. Not even some vertical mouse are big enough for me. I hate when my pinky and ring finger start hurting.
Plum 87 user here.\nYou can't go wrong with them.\n\nI got the 35g version, and I'm waiting for a 55g sheet to swap. 35g is nice, but I miss the heavier weight coming from blue's.\n\nThere's also the Korean rebranded version that comes with heavier weight.\n\nThe build quality is great.\nKeycaps are PBT, and a really thick. Programmability is a huge plus if you're switching between a pc and a mac. \n\nYou can also program a whole layout if needed.\n\nMacros are also huge plus, but I'm not using them.\n\nGot mine for 110$ shipped to Southern Europe (outside EU).\n\nAll I can compare it to is Novatouch, which didn't feel all that great.\n\nThe keyboard is super quiet and a charm to type and game on.\n\nAs for the build. You get super thick plastic. A metal backplate, really nice rubber fipout feet. Media keys and shortcut keys. There's also an RGB version if you're into that sort of things. It looks extremely retro and awesome. You get a braided cable of decent length and the best cable routing inspired by Realforce (side routed). The footprint is super small for a TKL keyboard.\n\nYou gan get a wireless version if you want fir a bit more. There are full-size, tkl, 75% and a 60-ish% models. All ANSI unfortunately if you're used to ISO.\n\nMx keycaps compatibility is a plus, but the keycaps are nice and use topre profile with lettering.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend it as nit just good alternative but a great one.\n\n\nNoopoo doesn't make them any more, Plum is the sub brand that makes them and it's rebranded by several companies. Niz, Abko, Hueueueu (no idea how it's spelled, it's the Korean version, and they also sell replacement dome sheets.)\n\n\nAny more questions feel free to ask. ;)
Yup, Plum 87.
Got one off AliExpress. It's pretty fidgety. And it was like 2$ or something like that.
holy fuck this is dank
This it the kind of technical lettering I want to do\n\nhttp://www.papirnisvet.com/photos/products/3147/3147_IMG_1674-30-01.jpg\n\n\nhttps://tehcrtanje.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/pismo1.png\n
I mean, ONE FUCKING CLICK AND BOOM!!!!\n\nBreakpoints GALORE!!!!!!!!
That's one of the things I'm afraid of. Better be gentle when I try it.
Well I snabbed the last 87 from this seller on AliExpress. \nI even got a DHL shipping, and it arrived in 3 days from the day it was shipped.\n\nAnd the domes are 15-20$ so all in all, with the mod it should be 130$ max. \n\nStill pretty cheap compared to a realforce or a HHKB.\n\n
Plum 87 35g, soon to be a 55g.\nAs for home, I tend not to use my PC a lot, so I use my laptop keyboard.\n\nBut probably getting a 75% ajazz with blacks for gaming at one point.
You have a compact full cooler master.\nI forgot the name, but yiu can find it on their website. The num pad doubles as a nav cluster.
Only thing I got from massdrop was AKG M220 studio headphones. That was a killer deal and the wait period was not as much. But for this. Kind of a rip off.\n\nRegular price of the plum is 95$ with 10$ shipping, and there was one vendor where it was 82$ with 28$ DHL shipping.\n\n\nCompared to the regular 114$ price on MD. Kind of bummed. Some one is taking quite a nice cut there, since the bulk price is probably cheaper.
No problem.\n\nI'm currently using the 35g and they're nice, but I have a lot of misstypes so I definitely need heavier weight, since I'm used to blues.
I still have my ergo 4000.\nPretty good keyboard considering it's not a mech.\n\nMade me learn to type correct.\n\nIf you're digging the layout go for it.\n\nMy only gripe is that they're massive.
I never got the git integration, it bores me.\nI prefer to use the console for git shenanigans, it's much more useful.
Damn.\nAbs. :(
I'm not sure I can find dye sublimation locally. Might look into that as an alternative.\n\nI can have them laser engraved but I'm not sure they will look good.
Hmmm, there they don't look quite as sculpted. :(\n\n\nBut a solid profile non the less.
Plum use Plum switches.\nTopre clones with MX compatibility. But they're pretty good, and come with nice thick PBT caps.\n\nPlus, full programmability.
35g.\n\nIt's strange at first, but you get used to it really quick.\nI came from Outemu Blues, so it's was quite the difference, but somehow they feel better than my coworkers Cherry MX Reds. It must be due to the rebound of the switches which is faster than on other switches.
I fail to see the point of this drop since you can order it from AliExpress shipped to Europe via DHL for 110$.\n\nOrdered mine few days ago, and currently waiting.\n\n\nCan't wait for this puppy to arrive and to give it a try.\n\nMight mod it and replace the 35g domes with 55g if I don't like the feel.\n\nThe retro look is a huge plus in my book.
And вчерашњи means yesterday in Macedonian too.
It's usually ok for Europe.\nFor instance, shipping to Serbia takes no longer than shipping from the states.\n\nI've ordered several higher prices stuff from AliExpress and it always came w/o problems.\n\nMy Plum even arrived in 4 days from shipping with DHL.\n\nThe seller had a lower price and taken in account the DHL shipping it was the same price as other sellers.
Oh most definitely. I think my co-workers will rejoice since I sold my Outemu Blues (much louder thank Cherry) and ordered this puppy. Love that it's fully programmable. I might go nuts later on with some custom keycaps.\n\nBut as I said. I'm digging the retro PC look of it.
I think it's time to learn nano or vi then :)\n\nI prefer nano when editing from the terminal, no other GUI editor can beat it.\nvi is still to clunky for me, but one day... One day...
For all the extensive research I did prior to ordering it feels more like Topre than Novatouch. Both in switch and sound.
> like you can in VS.code or Webstorm, no.\n\nVSCode NodeJS debugger is a god-send!!!! Main reason I migrated to it.\n\n
I guess different folks, different weighted strokes...\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll show myself out...
No problem.\n\n\nPlum Keyboard tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwMEu0mGvZvrR3ivsVRg1L2rfPo7ZBXEs\n\n\n\nIt starts with 55g sound type test and 45g sound test.\n\nPretty easy to follow regardless that it's in Korean. \n\n\nAlso here's the link on ebay for the dome sheet.\n\n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/112137004390
Battery and bluethooth won't be a problem for me anyways because I'm planning on always using it wired...\n\nEh, I'm still unsure if I should still go through with my order or wait another while

wait, there's a new batch coming soon? I was gonna buy it today, do you know if there are going to be substantial changes?
I did nofap for the week up until the US election, as a sacrifice to God in order for Trump to win, just in case he was serious about that being a serious sin or sacrifice or whatever you wanna call it, which I have honestly semi suspected for a while since I promised I would do nofap for a week during the 2012 superbowl for the Giants to win (as a 14 year old at the time it seemed like the most important thing I could sacrifice) which as you know ended up working miraculously. I tried the nofap promise a couple other times but they didn't work (I blame this as the reason I didn't get a qt gf and lose my virginty then) but i suspect they didn't work because I didn't get around to the original week of nofap until the summer after my junior year of high school when I spent 3 weeks in china on one of those youth trips and I had a roommate stuck with me (for perspective I made my original promise february of 8th grade, my last year in middle school). I kind of also suspect God was also happy that it was 3 weeks of nofap since it paid off the fap interest from waiting so long to do it, partly also because I ended up getting my first kiss from a girl on this trip, which I think was God's way of telling me we were back on good business terms. Anway on top of that when I get back from china I hear about the Trump phenomenon for the first time too so this might've been Jesus just showing off what happens when I don't fap or something. Anyway I figured my prayer promise score must've been really low since it took me so long to complete the promise last time, and I really wanted Trump to be president, so I had no choice but to do nofap in the week in advance. In any case unfortunately (or maybe fortunately since we do have a God and the aftlife is real but unfotunately again maybe because he takes fapping seriously) it seems like he really was serious about the whole fapping is a big serious sin stuff since it worked. Haven't been that religious for a while, but this bullshit has honestly renewed my faith, since its just ridiculous enough for me for God to be real, and for nofap to be his number one sin/sacrifice in which conquering it allows you to change history kind of stuff.\n\nWhere was I going with this? Oh yeah, nofap's not so bad if its only for a short set period of time and you have a strong motivation, like making the God Emperor your President. In any case a lot of New Englanders must've done nofap last weekend.
you're never really anonymous on the internet

Are those the sublimated DSAs that PMK sells? If so which colors did you pick?
Dude thats nothing. I was swimming with sharks during my summer break, and he bit my leg off, my friend was like, dude that must hurt and I was laughing and shit. Then he took another bite and got my left hand clean off, my friend was like dude you're left handed, this is terrible, I just kept laughing harder because I'm so strong. The blood was spraying now, and really starting to attract a lot more sharks, my mate is like, hey I see like 10 more fins coming towards you, get out of the water! I laughed and laughed, then I was pulled under and my friend could still hear me laughing until they got my neck and it became muffled gurgles underwater. Classic sharks, easily the funniest day of the summer, almost as good as the time I went hunting for wolverines.
there goes my nofap session...
does anyone even care what the meme is?\n\njust shitpost it around my man
Great, thank you. That's very helpful.
Don't really have a need for either, so no. Thanks for the offer though!
This is just how I personally prefer to have it set at.
I clearly had the right of way. I was driving on a marked road at a reasonable speed at the time of the collision, and he suddenly darted out into the middle of the street. I would argue that there was contributory negligence at the very least. 
I definitely recommend using the cloud as well. Dropbox works well for me, and it's extremely nice to be able to take notes on my laptop and then view them on my desktop at home. 
I'd say that's a matter of preference. I think the low vehicle FOVs look awful. I don't like having half my screen space being taken up by my own vehicle in third person. 
They didn't disappear though. It's just icon/HUD lag. If you watch my health, it falls from 79 to 70 when the grenades blew up.
I appear to have had the exact same problem. The key started working perfectly fine after a few hours of usage, without me consciously having to slam the key down. I set a small object on top of the space bar to keep it depressed all night while I slept, and now it seems to work 100% of the time. Odd, but I'm not complaining. 
+1 for G303, if the shape works for you it's a fantastic mouse. Clicks are so light that when I first got it coming from a death adder, I would often accidentally click while just resting my fingers on it.
On ps4 as well?
Haha, fair enough. Honestly have no desire to do it myself, but I need those achievements and I can never find any other versus servers. I'll fiddle around with it some more sometime, thanks!
Anything else in particular that you said? I just tried asking, and the rep I got denied me and told me that the codes are only given by manufacturers, and that Newegg items on eBay are different from Newegg.com items.
Thing is, they were grenades, not bombs. Was a Ground Support plane, rather than a Tank Hunter. It's like trying to use a handsaw to cut down a Redwood tree.
I remember in the early days of BF3, when the suppressor was objectively the best barrel attachment. Lower recoil, lower spread, less noise, no showing up on the map when firing. It was wonderfully broken 
Yup, just preview. Still a but absurd that it's even in the beta build though. And commando is my favorite class, I need to mess around with the medic AR a bit still.
Central US here, I've only got one HOE left myself but I'd be glad to play with a good team. Everyone feel free to PM me.
All three of those come from the "Magazine Vol. 2" item. 
Yeah, I doubt it'd work for most locations as well as us. Our Starbucks is literally the only one in the city, and there are only like two other coffee shops, so there isn't much competition. For bigger areas I imagine it makes even less sense than it does for my store.
Janet Fraiser/Carson Beckett deserved to die.

Surprisingly enough, he was actually willing to spend up to $150. I was pleasantly surprised.
My friends play, I'm poor.\n\n(Thanks for giveaway, OP)
It's in Options. I don't remember where, but I would assume it's in the Gameplay tab. Maybe Video.
Yup, I gave him like ten links to various keyboards in his budget.
Replied!
I think I've got it at 150% right now. Not maxed out, because 200% makes it look comically huge, and it literally covers half the screen
Same story for me with all the friends I've talked to. This one ended up getting a Corsair Strafe from his local Best Buy. Warned him about the non-standard bottom row, but he's not deep enough into the game to care about that.
I agree, some of his best moments are when he's serious. Window of Opportunity and Lost City come to mind for me
The arty shell tracers in this game are weird. I'll have shots that look like they go directly into the body of planes and go straight through, and then shots like this one that look like they're not even making contact count as hits. Probably a mixture of lag and the animations being slightly off.
I think bottoming out probably isn't an accurate term for this situation. I regularly bottom out with my other keys, but the spacebar requires more. Even when I just lightly press all the way down, it sometimes doesn't work. I have to really hammer it and actually press down with force to get it to actuate at all
Thanks for the detailed instructions! It works great.\n\nI do have one question though. Is there a way to host a versus server? I messed around with the config to try to change the gamemode from survival to versus, but it keeps giving me an error, saying it can't find it or something.
I think it's important to distinguish between the types of gods that were used in this case. The Tau'ri generally used "good" names, gods or figures that were generally not evil.\n\nApollo = God of Knowledge.  \nPrometheus = Titan that sided with the gods in their war, gave fire that he stole from Mount Olympus to humanity.  \nDaedalus = Created wings/was eventually given flight by the gods.\n\nCronus = Leader of the Titans. AKA, not a good guy.  \nAres = God of war.   \nPelops is a somewhat tricky one. I honestly have no clue why the writers chose to use him as a character.
Doesn't really matter to him what form factor it is, but if you have time to I'd love to take a look!
[DisplayFusion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/227260/) is an absolutely wonderful program if you have more than one monitor. 
I had this issue at first when I got my G303. I'd even just be resting my fingers on the buttons and sometimes accidentally click. Only took a week or two for me to get used to it, so I'd say keep at it and see how you feel in a few days.
JINTANGGIRTHFIRM asked me, JINTANGGIRTHFIRM, for help. Can't you read?\n\n(Bottom one, pilot, asked me, squadleader, for help)
Picked this up, thanks for the post.
I use the 'C' key, although I'm not sure if that's default. It's labeled as "Chase Camera" in the settings, for some reason, so try that!
Yeah, saw some of the other posts of people soloing scrakes with it. Seems OP. Scrakes were already relatively easy to take down with SCAR/AK, but the additional stumble makes it even easier.

I agree, don't know why but outemu blue is amazing
My favorite moment of the series has to be the [arrival of Sword Fleet near the end of Mass Effect 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHIAibDr3yM) [The soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m-vRZnUFxg) during that part is absolutely perfect; every time I listen to it, the sharp strings get the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. Then, just as the main orchestra kicks in, you hear the *Normandy* warping in, followed by the *pop* *pop* *pop* of numerous other ships. The first time I played it, my jaw dropped. Ships just kept warping in. There was no end to it. It felt like a full minute had gone by of me just watching ships warping in, and then the FREAKIN' *DESTINY ASCENSION* COMES IN TOO. It was this moment of the series that really made everything feel like one solid experience to me. From saving the Council in ME1 to investigating the Reapers in ME2 and gathering all of the might the galaxy had to offer in ME3, it was this, the culmination of the surviving remnants of all of the races that were willing to take a stand against the Reapers, that made it something truly special to me. This, more than anything else, made the Mass Effect universe feel truly vast and endless, rather than just the experiences of Shepard and his/her companions.
If It's only F2-F4 and F6-F8, it is almost certainly not dead LEDs. You most likely accidentally switched those other ones off. I had this issue as well when I got my first Ducky Shine 3, with only F1 and F5 working for some reason. Press FN+F9, that should fix it.
Nah, they're still made of depleted uranium, at least in regard to bullets. Explosives work well though, and roadkills are always instakills.
Mic wasn't working in Discord, that was a response in squad chat 
I used to own a 2411z and an LG 29UM67 at the same time, before I upgraded the 2411z to something better. When I had both, I would swap between the two depending on what games I played, so I definitely think that your plan to get both is a good one.\n\nAs for what to get first, I would say it depends on what type of games you play, and whether or not you want to play semi-competitively. By that, I don't mean that you're gonna go pro in CSGO or anything like that, but in faster-paced games, the high refresh rate is very, very beneficial. \n\nFor a while, due to space constraints, I only had my ultrawide on my desk at 75hz, and it felt "fine." I still did well in games like CSGO/BF4. But when I finally got a bigger desk hooked up my 2411z again, my performance definitely improved. Twitch shots were easier, and I didn't miss small details. Those are the main types of games that I play, so if I could have only picked one, I would've gone with the 2411z. \n\nIf you play mainly single player games or just play casually, however, the ultrawide is super nice. More immersion and all that. It's also very nice for other nom-gaming tasks, like Web browsing, having multiple documents/windows open side by side, and watching movies.\n\nTLDR: get the 144hz first if you play a lot of competitive online games, get the ultrawide first if not
That's helpful, thanks! I've already done that, as I first realized there was an issue after I had already swapped out the stock caps for one of my other sets. Switched back to the stock spacebar cause I saw they were different depths, but the problem persisted. Actually did what you suggested and put a random key on it, and it still had to be forcefully depressed to actuate. Figured it was the key, but I wasn't 100% sure and just wanted to check to see if anybody had any other ideas before having to open it up
The Siege, Part 1. They were looking for a world to potentially evacuate to IIRC.
I had this problem with my Shine 3 in a different game a few years ago. Sounds like you accidentally altered your repeat rate, so that holding a key makes it spam multiple inputs per second rather than just one constant input.\n\nTry pressing FN + F1, then FN + F5. Those will reset both the repeat delay and the repeat rate to default, respectively.
This sounds similar to what I'm experiencing. Just looked at some of the desoldering guides on the wiki, but I don't quite understand what you mean by the pin being tilted away. Would you mind detailing that a little bit more? Sorry, I haven't ever actually had to take apart one of my boards before.
Yup. 1440p @ 165hz, although Shadowplay only records up to 60fps. 
Listen to that stuff OP, goes into some more detail than I did.
I would watch the living shit out of a Ba'al spinoff. 
Make sure you get a proper monitor to go with the PC. 60FPS on a standard monitor is good compared to consoles, but a 144hz (or even higher) monitor is a complete game changer. 
> BFH will never die.\n\nI needed a good laugh today, thanks
Personally, I use VLC Media Player to watch all the movies I download, and it's simple enough to change the aspect ratio in the settings. On mobile right now or else I'd look and type out a step by step process, but it should be easy enough to google. Otherwise, if you use Firefox or Chrome as your browser, it's pretty easy to find add-ons/plug-ins to change your aspect ratio on Youtube, Netflix, etc.

Nah. Gif doesn't make it clear, but earlier in the round I had shot another plane of his down when he took a similar attack approach on me. Called me a "stupid hacker asshole" and whatnot. Apparently, he couldn't comprehend how a plane could be shot down at literally point blank range.

When I was in undergrad, I was walking to class one day when the strap on one of my flip flops broke. When I got to class, I got on my phone, ordered a new pair on Amazon, and less than 24 hours later it was on my doorstep.
1. Yes and no. The healing from syringes do not stack. So if you shoot one dart and then another immediately after, you will not heal the amount of two darts. Rather, you'll heal about a second's worth of heals for the first dart, and the entirety of the second dart. Think of it as just refreshing or resetting the time of a single heal, rather than stacking them.\nHowever, if you take the left-side perks in the Medic tree, those effects DO stack. So if there's a single player tanking a fleshpound, for example, it's still not a bad idea to hit them with multiple darts in order to give them more stacks of damage reduction, even if the heals aren't stacked.\n\nEdit: Ignore the first half. The heals do stack, in a manner of speaking. Two darts will not heal twice as fast, but they WILL heal the amount of two darts over the regular length of time. So shooting two darts one after another will essentially double the length of the heal and apply both darts' worth as if you had applied the second dart immediately upon the expiration of the first. So it won't give you a burst of faster healing for panic situations, but it will give you that sustained heal.\n\n2. I used to suffer from that "save it until I REALLY need it" philosophy, but over time, you learn how to manage it. For the first few waves, you honestly never really need to use them, but for mid-late game, the berserker grenades and medic grenades especially are essential. You get 5 of them per wave, more if you have a demo to resupply off of, and not using them at all is wasting it more than using it and only getting minimal effect. Medic grenades I generally toss down when multiple large Zeds spawn, as healing with darts can be difficult when everybody is being knocked around or running in front of one another. If more than one teammate is under a certain threshold of health, you'll also probably want to use it then instead of healing them both with darts. As for Berserker grenades, you want to use them preemptively to keep large Zeds from raging, or reactively to pull them out of raging.\n\n3. I've never had trouble finding games on any of the four difficulties, but I'd probably say it's either hard or suicidal. I personally don't play lower than suicidal, but there seems to be a decent amount when I've looked.\n\n4. It depends on the person. I don't remember how long it took me. You can do some things that will speed it up, though. For example, basically every perk in the game should buy a medic pistol after they have all of their other weapons. Not only will it help your team by healing them, but you still get XP toward your Medic perk, even if you're playing something else.\n\n5. It's basically a Jack of All Trades, Master of None type class. Good for experimenting with various weapon combos that otherwise aren't feasible.\n\n6. Never stand still against either of them. If you're playing Berserker, try to tank their aggro. If you're Medic, keep the Berserker/whoever is trying to tank alive. A good Medic is honestly probably the most important part of a boss fight, because it's essentially just attrition. Once you learn how to dodge attacks and everything else to minimize damage, a few people with off-perk Medic Pistols will suffice, but keeping everybody alive is by far the most important thing to try to do. More people alive = more damage, more people that can draw aggro while the others heal, etc.
Cavalry Superiority, pls DICE
Only happens when the horse is still tagged as an enemy, which lasts for just a few seconds after the rider is killed/gets off. After those few seconds go by, horse becomes neutral and gives no points (and is also much harder to kill). In this case, the only reason I was driving back there in the first place was to kill him, but somebody else shot the rider off first.
Damn. I just thought about it for a second, and there's a decent amount of parallels. \n\n- Ancients = Protheans. Long dead race of immensely powerful and technologically advanced aliens that got wiped out.\n\n- Atlantis = Citadel. On a much smaller scale, but a giant space station/city in space.\n\n- Stargate = Mass Relays. This one is pretty obvious. Although the spaceship-sized Supergate is probably a better comparison.\n\n- Replicators/Asurians = Geth. AI created for innocent purposes that go out of control and try to murder the shit out of everything.\n\n- Ori = Reapers. Lots of stuff that can match up here. Ships with death beams that vaporize basically anything, super hard to kill, religious brainwashing/indoctrination, etc.\n\n- Crucible = Ark of Truth. "Oh shit this enemy is huge and there's no way we can beat them, except with this super awesome crazy weapon"\n\nA lot more too, but that's what immediately sticks out to me.
This is an old clip from a few weeks ago. I've since upgraded to a 165hz monitor... *Feelsevenbetterman*
My favorite part is my futile medic grenade going off as I roll over on the ground.
I was sure about it when I typed it, but apparently I'm wrong. Edited my post to be correct. Thanks for pointing it out!
That's because that's just the way Massdrop works. Massdrop works because it's based on a groupbuy concept. For example, 100 people want a particular mechanical keyboard, which is somewhat of a niche product. Those 100 people put in orders with Massdrop, Massdrop puts in a bulk order with the manufacturer at a reduced price, and the buyers pay somewhere in between the normal and the bulk price, saving money themselves while at the same time giving Massdrop a slight profit. The manufacturer also benefits, because they get to move 100 units, which is probably higher than their normal volume of sales.\n\nSo it works really well when people want a particular keyboard, or a particular set of speakers, or something that only hobbyists and enthusiasts would buy. But GPUs and CPUs are very, very high-volume items compared to the stuff that's available on Massdrop, so a company like Intel can sell 100 units without blinking an eye. As a result, there's no real incentive for manufacturers to agree to have a groupbuy when they could sell them directly to the consumer and not have to split the profits.\n\nTL;DR - You're better off looking for CPU/GPU sales on Amazon, Newegg, and the like. /r/buildapcsales is great like that other post said.
LRLLL. I believe that Bring the Heat and Ground Fire are the only ones necessary for this, though. \n\nI still tap fire for trash for ammo conservation purposes, but since it was a solo boss wave and I had two other MWGs inside the barn, I just held it down here.

Always enjoyed his rant in Sunday: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d3tN0AbBBDQ\n\nParticularly helpful since it's a funny moment in an episode that otherwise has me trying to hold back tears 
That's definitely a good one!
Ni!
Gave me a laugh for the day, thanks. \n\nMaybe don't exaggerate as much next time and try to put all the blame on your store for your obvious lack of knowledge.
It's honestly been a while, but the two things I remember are that he started the Olympic Games and that his father was Tantalus, aka the guy who was cursed to stand under a tree with fruit just out of reach and water that receded every time he tried to drink for all eternity as punishment for something. Tantalus was mentioned in that episode (Torment of Tantalus) with Ernest and the meeting point of the Four Great Races. \n\nIn mythology, Pelops was cut into pieces by his father to be used in a stew, but the gods felt sorry for him and revived him.
Just looked at OP's post history, 10/10 would laugh again
Copy and paste of my other comment so you can see it:  \n\nIf It's only F2-F4 and F6-F8, it is almost certainly not dead LEDs. You most likely accidentally switched those other ones off. I had this issue as well when I got my first Ducky Shine 3, with only F1 and F5 working for some reason. Press FN+F9, that should fix it.
Fair point. I guess the Replicators being toys for Reese is a more apt comparison than the Asurans fighting the Wraith. At the same time though, they weren't created with a "kill everything and be a plague to the galaxy" purpose, but as a way to defeat the Wraith.
Yup. My favorite players, though, are the ones that make it their personal mission to kill me, and attempt that by flying in nice straight lines while shooting at me.

2560x1080, I play on an LG 29UM67 Ultrawide Monitor. Gfycat doesn't seem to like the 21:9 aspect ratio.
You know, I wasn't sure of the exact word myself, so I looked it up and found conflicting stuff. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Npo0cmp-VY) is titled with the "tis," but I swear that to my ears, it sounds like "it is." 
Looking for a price check on both a TKL and full-sized Ducky Shine 3. MX Blues with blue LEDs, all original stuff included. Thanks in advance!

I wonder what that E3 announcement will be.   \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n^^^Stargate ^^^Worlds?\n^^^just ^^^let ^^^me ^^^dream
I was wondering how I could fit an SSD in, this looks pretty good. I'll look at it further and show him as well, thanks!
Damn, haha. Rewatching it looks like it couldn't have been more than a frame or two. I never heard them charging in game either, nice catch!

My store has been doing this since January or so, and I actually forgot that it wasn't a corporate-wide thing. But to answer everybody asking in this thread, we literally just have stanchions (those rope things used to create lines, like on Black Friday) set up from the door leading to Starbucks. At 8AM, the LOD basically just comes up and opens it up for the guests that are there to shop at opening. I think it's pretty dumb, but there's actually a decent amount of people that come in for Starbucks in the morning.
PM'ed
Awesome, I'm on mobile right now but I'll look it over in more detail when I get home. Thanks for the builds!
I believe so, yes. Although the episode was Brief Candle (I get those two mixed up a lot too). And he was mentioned, never seen. Presumed to be dead/missing since he essentially abandoned his experiment 
A 1070, actually. Recently upgraded, but I've always been used to playing BF1/BF4 on all low settings for maximum frame rate. I've tried maxing out all the settings, but didn't like it because it lowered my FPS to ~90, which was a bit jarring when I'm used to 144. I like pretty games and all, and for single player I took the tradeoff, but I'd rather have the consistently high frame rates and lower input lag in multi-player.
...I am a failure 
Sorry, sold them right before bed and forgot to update the thread. Thank you for your interest though!
I just looked at [the manual](http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/page-en/ducky-one/) for the One online, you're right in that they use different key combinations. Not quite sure what you'll actually need to do then, but at least now you know you don't have to RMA/sell your board :)
You've pretty much got it right on with your edit. He was expected to have a symbiote. Carter and Teal'c sensing the Naquadah within symbiotes is only really useful when they're trying to figure out if a human has one or not, not when they think the individual is a Jaffa.
It was me, replying to a comment made over VOIP by my friend/imposter. Was using squad chat, as my microphone wasn't working in Discord at the time
he talks fulltime, never just lets the game do its thing. There's not even continuous seconds without him shouting some random shit, just for the sake of talking.
What would be the best way to get the devs to add it? Must be an easy command to add :/
Color code for the blue?
Looks really good, where do you get those?
How much for the entire combo? Do you have links?
Thank you!
Yea I don't think it can get worse since it's already.. shiny and stuff. Doesn't bother me that much, just forces you to use it with clean hands pretty much. Sensor is of course a huge plus, and the weight is nice.
can confirm, exact board and puller, scratched my keycaps
The reason is rather silly; my hands can't handle the switches. I've used mx browns full-time for over half a year without any problems, but when I switched to 67g zealio my left hand started to ache. It's gotten worse over the past week, with a tendon acting up.\n\nIndeed, building one yourself really is a cool experience. I'd recommend it!
What board is that with the green plate?
Someone I know has a canon g9 and when I tried some macro photography with it on small insects etc, I noticed I could go pretty much infinitely close to my object. How exactly does this work? Canon's website states it should be about 1 cm (0.4in) but it's definitely smaller. When I put the lense pretty much directly on my phone screen, it would still get a non-blurry picture of the pixels.\n\nHow exactly does this work? How do I know (except for testing it..) if camera's or lenses perform this well up close?
ESL must have a lot of money too by now, but their tournaments aren't even close to EL standards.
Wouldn't that be dangerous in case an enemy comes close though?
You can put colored led's inside the switches, but there are only two pins on the pcb for each led. I don't think it's possible to do RGB in-switch leds with just two legs, and the board doens't have a controller for it I think. \n\nThe rgb they're talking about there is the case rgb lighting, which is on the bottom of the board. It does have a 6-pin controller for that on the back.\n\nb.87 doesn't support any different led's than b.face. I think you need at least 3 holes for rgb leds.
"I like the gritty feeling" would be a subjective argument, nothing to understand there.. the product is fine, it lasts a long time and functions as a key switch. The rest is personal preference to me? It's like calling a cabriolet flawed because of the noise levels..
np!\n
idk if it changes anything, recently switched to a normal cable (from my calculator, lol) and didn't notice a difference.
Unplugged the tablet, de-activated the drivers via task manager, uninstalled logitech gaming software... still the same. I'll upload a video once my camera battery is charged. It's not too bad, I just wonder why it's there. \n
Why does he switch weapons every second?
Has the eve set been used at all?
Thanks!
Thanks!
What is your reasoning behind this?
Woo lookin good
I think that's not how you do it in the US
20day old qck+, very clean
pm
we got the upvote for that
Thanks! Would indeed cost to much, got the original set here for about 30$ and that would cost over 60 :(
because 100km is... a very long distance? Look at the bike he's riding too, I'm very impressed
I think deadmau5 or something would've been better. 
Even you virtual items are great
so they're exactly the same guy/people? why do they not 'release' this cap under the jellykey name? I'm confused, could someone explain what I'm missing?
danke
Sold a b.face to /u/allochthomas
showing emotion = mental problems? 
Great picture OP
Pm\n
Or use a modern sharing solution? No need to upgrade decent phones if this is the only issue
Picture with lighting enabled? Full frost must look great in the dark
yea I usually play the type of music SuperstituM uses in his youtube videos. 
Well I've used a desoldering pump. Not something like the hakko fr-300 :(\n\nFortunately all the pads are still 100% fine so even though it maybe doesn't look that clean (not visible from outside the case) it's very well possible to just touch it up and make it clean again when you've got the right equipment.\n\nHere's a small album with pcb pics: https://imgur.com/a/bByHE

Korean skies must be very different haha, looks good though
Shipping is around 25, not that extreme :p
thank you!
RemindMe! 5 days
ah, gonna be hard to get a hold of one then, thanks!
anyone know what he says in swedish?
Tried your settings, launches in a 16:10 resolution, when I force it:\n\nmat_setvideomode 1440 1080 0\nChanging resolutions from (1920, 1080) -> (1440, 900)\n\nwhat are your nvidia settings on the size/position tab? also, does it show up in your possible 4:3 resolutions?
Bought switches from /u/xcampkillx
Pm!
There's a lot of money on the line.. match should be as fair as possible. Not sure how unfair it exactly is, but he has a point imo
the only difference is that PCB mount switches have two pins that fit in holes in pcb's. This adds extra stability. It's not really necessary when using a plate. You can use pcb-mount switches on most pcbs (in combination with a plate or not). If the pcb doesn't have holes for the two plastic pins you can just cut them off. http://puu.sh/tCDvh/c363bd0eff.jpg
What exactly is that foam silencing method for the stabs? I've read about that before but never really understood what actually happened. Where is the tape/foam applied?
Very good price on the b.face, glws!
Focus on my breathing.
So every single time someone asks 'what switch do I buy' we say 'it's personal preference' but when Cherry says something like this suddenly gateron is the superior switch? I agree with y'all that cherry's statement might not be what we'd want to hear from them but I personally think cherry is indeed superior over gateron. I've tried all common switches from gateron and cherry, and I would pick cherry over gateron every day of the week. Why? I like the gritty feeling, and I think the gaterons are too wobbly. The keycaps can rotate too much for my liking.\n\nI don't want to start an argument about which switch is better, I just wanted to say that it's still personal preference.. although I agree cherry should not act like they're done and just produce nothing but the same switch for 50 years.
That looks almost like zealio housings... where did you get those :o
Mr buttonpush
woah that's a lot of work, looks great though!
Could always paint it, their performance and silence is amazing. I'm still sad that they don't just offer a black and white version though.
off topic: it's 2017, can we please not use gyazo... we have mobile users
... I have a wacom ctl480 connected... Could that be the cause?
No
Got mine today, no. It's all plastic, feels quite cheap to me (coming from logitech g400s)\n\nThe scrollwheel is rubber, but I don't think that's what you meant.
/u/jorisboers
I downvoted your comment, then went to check if there was a dust particle on my laptop screen. you got me there
they're q7's and also not from the last gen.. still nice cars though
Can't wait, thanks for your effort!
Yes it is better, but at this budget that addition really doesn't make any sense
Yes, I know they do. Thanks :)\n\nMaybe someone has a set laying around and wants to get rid of it, can always try. Will just buy from there otherwise
Alright, I'm just a happy 212 + noctua fan owner but I get where you're coming from. You're right :)
Looks very clean, what color codes are these?
Thanks!
Why do you have to act like that on a keyboard forum geez
What color is that on the mid plate? Looks great!
quality still goes down somehow, maybe because that's how cs:go's ingame voice chat works? Does anyone know?
Does anyone know what causes the stem wobble with gaterons / zealios? Is that the stem or the housing?
Looking good, what color codes?
Funny and original
That EU shipping thing I checked is still going to happen, right? Can't wait :)
'little  bit of a smoke going on' he says shit like that every round, 'bit of a push..' 'bit of..' just stop it, it gets annoying after a while
Still doesn't appear in the list, launches in 1280x1024, and when I force it with mat_setvideomode it goes to some 16:10 resolution nearby. I have no idea...
Not sure if you are aware that eBay has got tons of cheap 2x3x4 mm LEDs and often free shipping. Maybe that helps, glwb!
Well compared to western Europe.. 
Then it launches in 1440 x 900 :/
Tactile
doubt he minds if people say happy x-mas lol
I play faceit on a regular basis and I barely see any cheaters?
Aha the figure is measured from the sensor itself, that makes sense. Thank you!
>Everyone has to find the right balance between gunfire and footstep sounds.\n\nYea that's what I'm trying to say lol
Could you show me the custom resolutions tab, and what settings you used there? Also, launch options / autoexec with mat_setvideomode probably? Still doesn't work for me :/
Russia's space program is pretty good tho
Zeus said on twitter last week that there won't be roster changes to Na'Vi cs:go 
Yea sojuz is so reliable, it's insane
Is this also pretty much the same over there? http://puu.sh/pKDlz/3f8d0fdfca.png\n\nThanks for helping though, hopefully I'll find a solution 
What's your opinion / thoughts to people blaming games for gun violence?
Thanks! Looked better than I'd even remotely hoped so I finally made an imgur :) Thankfully don't know how to setup or view imgur comments lol 
Yeah for sure man! Plenty planned for the future, hopefully will have something by the end of the year :)\n\nAnd dw dude, plenty of boards to come! Haven't really looked into ALPS much yet, crazy looking stem :P I'll investigate though!
Personally, yeah I'm happy with it. Maybe not ready for people that expect a realforce for $100 but I want to see /u/XMIT keep doing his thing and developing this so it eventually is
http://imgur.com/3Kkawll Title accuracy improved, thanks fam
And the F is for hall eect. Thankfully all keys working but that whole situation was pretty hilarious. Without hall eect, I might not have tuned in to keyclack or seen his other content which I think is well done and pretty on point. The board I got is certainly much better than the one in that review, so maybe it worked out for everyone
Best so far, goes with me from board to board. Do you have any more stuff coming soon? I'm still kicking myself for missing the M-10A... \n\nEdit: M10-A. While I'm at it: Any chance for an ALPS mount keycap from you? All hail the king!
so dope! goes really well with the bamboo!
Very nice with the inked caps! I got my bamboo 60% today & am really digging it so far as well. I agree that if the tolerances were tightened up especially on the housings it would make a world of difference. But I also think most of us realized the boards weren't gonna be super refined & accepted that some early adopter tax would have to be paid.\n\nI'm thinking a thick application of lube on the sliders & stabs should significantly quiet the board down. That is at least the 1st thing I'm gonna try with mine once I find out if lube won't interfere with the sensor in no way (don't see why it would but can't 100% confirm). I'd also like to find a way to dampen the upstroke, I would say that is the 2nd worst offender with noise on these next to stabilized keys. Most of that is nitpicking though, even with it's flaws I'm still happy to have one of these boards & do not regret the purchase at all.
The switches are very fast and feel very smooth. The 70g weight feels closer to mx red than black but is definitely between the two. They seem as if they would also be pretty quiet if there wasn't so much additional movement of the switch itself in the wood plate. The worst offenders are the stabilized keys but that's just stabilized keys. The cross mount of the stems are also a bit inconsistent. Most are good but a few could use a quick leveling. The stems and the looseness of the housing both seem to contribute to keys aren't perfectly aligned. It isn't noticeable while typing. \n\nAnyway, I'm liking this thing a lot so far. Tighter tolerances on the fundamentals would make it way better though IMO.  
hall eect, did your F key break like manofinterests' did
oh my... very nice!\n\nI told myself I'd wait for r2 XMIT because I'd want to hear r1 impressions, soo...\n\n\nWhat do you think of it? What other linears have you tried?
Thank you! Smooth and light. I've tried cherry red and black, gat red and black. Haven't any other hall effect, vintage cherry black or gat clear, yellow, etc., nor any real alps linears. So probably not qualified to say too much, but I prefer the best of this to the best on those. But the others are more consistent. I would say this is like a getting a tesla early on. Sweet tech, every sees that it could be amazing. But a few details show they haven't made as many as other manufacturers yet. 
How do you like the keyboard?
Would those silencing clips fit on these? 
I'll see what I can do about this.
How's the Wave cap feel on the hall-effect switches!
So you're saying they are worth it, but the quality control isn't mass production ready?
Hah, awesome man!! Hope you're enjoying smashing that escape key :D
Just a tiny bit man!! If you're gentle it'll be fine - even with force it won't break off!\n\nI am the owner, yes :) Well, first thing I did with my very first groupbuy was to fill a Poker with metal caps, felt amazing, then I had to ship them off :( \nI don't really hold too many of my own caps :( just one sample of most, even then not all :S
Oh sick man! Hope you're enjoying the escape cap! :D Photos from the new lens look good too - the closeups are pretty great.\n\n/u/ramasbae grabs a cap and chucks it straight on her board when one of my shipments comes in :P\n\nFucking adorable doggo btw 😍😍
Melbourne, Australia. Otherside of the world :( Heading over for the Seattle meetup in July though! Wish I could jump across to Canada :/
Let's form a holy trinity
Thanks for the post mate! Hopefully we can meet in SF :D
Hahaha he is the *Mother of Panda's*
Gotta add that to my Tinder profile
Woah nice, great shots man - nice camera! 
Can confirm /u/nevicata as a legitimate buyer :)
Always walk behind the photographers :P
Hey man! The caps are being shipped to me this week and will be packaged next week then shipped out!! There are 39 blue x's and 11 blue o's 😊
Especially me ahahaha
lmao I made this low-key at work 😂
This is true 😂😂
NEVER!! This is my baby hahaha, had it since 2014! It's aged so nicely man, I think they get better with age, the rubber feels more malleable 
Thanks so much man! Was an absolute mission packaging them hahaha. Started at about 6PM and finished at 1:30AM, was worth it though, really really happy with how they came out. And just something extra I wanted to throw in to show my gratitude and return something back to people who have supported. \n\nCheers once again 💛
If you pay for all my prototyping costs 💛 *you're mine*
You lucky lucky man! Enjoy the caps :)
Yeah! Looks super satisfying to play with haha. \n\nAbsolutely, super nice set and doubleshot is always cool - the packaging was surprisingly good too
We've reached equilibrium
Nice work! I gotta get some sliders myself :) Gotta do the same to my HHKB :D
_The addiction kicks in_\n\nThanks for the support bro! You're gonna love the 65 :)
I'd support that!
I'm actually very excited for this, you cannot believe
Thanks man! Took it on my new camera - really enjoying using it. 35mm f/1.4 on a cropped sensor equating to 50mm
Do it! It's fun building new boards :D Then she can use it for photography too :P
And yeah, my cropped sensor camera was struggling :P
An entirely well thought out crush on moly thankyou
That would definitely be cool! Really want to see more things move over to USB-C :)
:hsp: :gazoz:\n
Hahaha no worries at all man ><\n\nGlad you like it! If you want more of a permanent mix, can use pliers to push the stem inwards (a tiny bit) :)\n\nWish I had an entire set too! Best I got is an M10 full of SS caps :P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5APR56_AOo
Yeah that came out really well! Oils/stains make a huge difference, nice work :)
Thanks for coming along mate had a great time 💛 looking forward for round 2😉
Both super keen man!!
Every ladies dream, neck to torso to leg ratio on point\n
There is the _valentines edition available now_ 👀👀👀👀\n\nHaha but nah, that cap fits in really nicely with the board :D 
Not gonna lie, I actually did
absolute mad man
I love you BB 💛💛
It feels good man! Trust! They're very nicely spec'd orings ;)\n\nIt's like in between a pro 2 and a Type-s!
Woah, what camera/lens did you use for this? Photos look great mate :)\n\nAlso, is that a bottle of hand sanitizer on the table? 😂
/u/zisb do it!
The hydro numpad keys (GMK/cherry profile in general) is very comfy on it! \n\nMore M10's will be coming :)
/u/cozmosis !
Yes 💛
Bae
haha that's dope, that little dude looks fun to press. Got my hydro the other day actually, first GMK set, pretty impressed with it - they feel awesome. Nice photo too!
oh man, i should have added that in somewhere, missed opportunity :(
HAH, Potrait mode? I use my iphone camera for a lot of Instagram shots too :P \n\nOh man, I loaded 9 of them on my m10 prototype and *holyshit* it's hefty, definition weapon. Glad you like the cap bro!
Only if it's sensual 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/keebs/ here you go mate :)
That's exactly it!
I love the carved look of the case, looks awesome man - nice work! What wood did you use? Did you treat it at all? :)\n\n
Woah, that looks like an OG powder coated red wave! Very rare :O Nice photo mate, love the filmic look of the photo, that grain is on point 😍😍\n\nPosted this on [rama.army](http://rama.army) :D\n\nWhat camera you shooting on?
Hahahaha we have issues man, but it's worth having all this cool stuff to play with ;)
He is the mastercrafter. /u/cozmosis <3
Hahaha can't wait man!!
Can't wait 👌👌😍
I am not sure yet, I will report back :P
Nice shirt /u/xx7 ;) looks like an amazing turnout and what an amazing collection of boards!! Thanks for posting 👌👌😍
😍♥️
ohhh right yeah, that would be dope - just cover the keys with labels :P
/u/hiv_mind came over today and brought along a HSP styro container ([Halal Snack Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halal_snack_pack)) full of Industrial SA PBT caps as a gift, even went to the effort of making the holy trinity sauce (BBQ, Garlic, Chilli) out of *hand coloured* PVA glue. \n\nAlong with a bottle of Molybdenum Disulfide (bit of an inside joke), but I'll be putting it to good use 👀\n\nThe generosity of this community is too much sometimes. Anyways if you're in Melbourne, there's a meetup on the 25th of Feb (This Saturday). Come along if you can! https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5scqmt/news_melbourne_au_meetup/\n\n 
He's not wrong😂👀
Dude those two are meant to be 😍😍 Gotta take pics when you get that together!!
Awesome!! How does it feel on Topre? \n\nWhich slider are you using btw :D
I'm excited!!
New favourite cap 😍😍😍😍
YESSSSS, finally man!
The more macropads you allow for the more your efficiency increases? 🤔🤔📈📈
Woah, you posted these quick :O
TBH, doing that all day sounds better than what I'm doing now 😂 Full time + this kills it. \n\nTake me now fam
Well, I am going to America first :D
Aw thanks so much mate!! 💛 Means a lot :) Glad you're liking what I'm doing :D
Woah glad you like it that much man!! Will hope to have it out as soon as possible :) cheers!
Woah, who took along the M10 O_o. Not many people have those around... *yet*
Thanks man! Need my PCB guy to stop being busy!! :P /u/27percent pls
Very nice gesture, good on ya mate 💛
You going to change it to **WASD** or **PL:"**?
Hahaha, absolutely! \n\nNo worries at all man, thanks for the support and enjoy the caps! :)
Awww cheers bro! Glad you like what I'm doing 
Ah nice nice, thanks for the photos :)
💛💛
Hahaha please no :P\n\nYeah man was so much fun, wish you where down for it ;(
Glad you like it bro! Really excited to get the spinner out there :D Cheers for the interest, really means a lot 💛
Glad you like it man!! I personally use it as part of my home defence system. Just need some sexy cables to replace the stock ones it comes with ;)
Good one 😂
HAHA yeah, that 60% is his! My HHKB is in the background on top of the laptop (behind the Styro container) ;)\n\nActually! I already did some alu SA profile caps for [INVYR](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=84048.msg2240299#msg2240299) ages ago, I'll be doing some to celebrate the launch of the M10 soon though ;D\n\n
Oh man that CozCap is freaking amazing holyshit /u/cozmosis you legend.\n\nStill one of my all time favourite artisan caps! Can't wait to see it with the set /u/thearchdill \n
Glad you like it man!! Looks awesome ♥️👌
Don't wanna cut yourself #daintytypists
wooo! /u/outragedpudding 💛
Absolutely stunning mate! Posted the photo on http://rama.army/ loving the theme :D
I use a HHKB in the office - I did after about a year chuck in some o-rings to the sliders for feels/sound, but it wasn't to bad with out it. Granted, the guy next to me has Cherry Blues so mine pales in comparison (sound wise) :P\n\nI don't think the sound would bother anyone really, it's more of a soothing thock rather than a loud click. The amount of sounds a person can focus on before it just becoming ambient noise is like 3 different sounds, so if you're in an already moderately noisy environment - I think you'll be sweet :)
Why didn't you post the original??\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wWU9oWb.jpg

Head Stats, heart soO
They aren't new players though. They're just running contracts out.
Might be wrong, but I don't think that's a mechanical keyboard.
Neat, which monitor? Do you play SC2? :)
Title's a little harsh. I don't think Inno mismicroed significantly there? He didn't have enough units to hold it.
That doesn't sound right to me. I think the only non-standard thing about the current Choc Mini is that one key has non-standard width, I think the right shift is less wide than left shift at 1.25x. Doesn't mean you can't replace the keycaps.  
And the made up reason will be quickly shown to be a lie by referencing this Reddit post, which is the entire point of why this post was such a braindead idea of yours.
Presumably just trying to break his spirit, combining the IEM 4-0 with a 2-0 lead. That context is probably the right way to look at the mules. The mules were trying to say that he was unbeatable by Stats.  
Harstem 2-0 Stats
Don't take Twitch chat as being representative of anyone's actual opinion :) I agree PiG did great.
FWIW, bringing blues to work is a career-limiting move.
And given that sOs seems to forget to get thermal lance every other game, it'd improve his winrate too :)
It's best not to try. People who want to read minified source can do it regardless of these tricks.
Thanks for being pedantic, that's always a really useful contribution.
watch Nerchio vs Dear in one of the first shoutcraft months, made Dear's colossi look ridiculously bad
Yes. Also you only need a Chrome extension rather than a web page if the domain you want to access the JS from isn't the same one hosting the script.
Yep, hydras help too.\n\nIf you want to improve quickly, I think this build is very good:\n\n17 hatch\n\n18 gas\n\n17 pool\n\n@pool, 2 queens, take two off gas, start ling speed, make 6 lings, drone constantly\n\n3:15 third base\n\n3:45 roach warren, back on gas, add two more gases, start lair\n\n4:15 two evo chambers\n\n@lair, start ranged attack and carapace upgrades and roach speed\n\nFrom there, keep building roaches until you get to 200/200 supply.\n\nWith practice, you should be able to hit 200/200 roaches with some ravagers around 9:00 game time.  You can try repeatedly in custom games until your time gets there, then you'll be ready to wreck the ladder.  :)
it me
Essen in Manhattan also uses these.
Hm, but I think the reason Dear lost 20 probes is because Nerchio planted lurkers between his natural and third while Dear's colossi died because they didn't have enough range or vision to hit the lurkers.\n\nHappy to be wrong, but I still don't see colossus as a lurker counter. Obviously Nerchio doesn't either.
The best thing we have at the moment is the PiG dailies on YouTube. Also builds at allthingszerg.com and Spawning Pool.
2017's been great though.
ZvZ has a habit of turning into ling-bane for three minutes and then roaches for ten minutes which is pretty boring.\n\nPvP is pretty great.
Just LotV
There's only a "best" keyboard for a given price range and you haven't explained what yours is.
Huh, I thought "on line" was just an NYC thing.
I think so, yeah. You can always just move to a lower graphics setting.
> Do Your Eyes Actually Open?\n\nNo Really, We Just Want To Make Sure You're Super Racist Too, You Are, Right?
Astoria Bookshop is the only bookstore. Perhaps check out Noguchi museum.
Hm, they're all popular gaming keyboards, probably just go see which one you like the size and feel of best. If you don't care about things like backlighting I'd probably go with the Corsair compact one.
Yes, though there are some desktop BitTorrent clients (like Vuze) that also support WebTorrent peers, so it's not just browser to browser.
Putting quotes around a phrase usually denotes sarcasm.
Huh. The keyboard I'm using might work for you, then. It registers keys if you breathe on it. :)\n\nNoppoo Choc Mini with Gateron Clears
Yeah it's an Na player who lets ByuN use his account.
Muta/Ling/Bane is just harder to play so you're probably not as good at it.\n\nYou can make roach/ravager work up to Masters on the ladder.
Dunno about FPS but there was a pro StarCraft 2 player who used a RealForce, so it's fine.
Yeah, we're definitely quibbling at this point.\n\nBut when you say "was arguably the best Protoss", there should be someone willing to actually make that argument, and say that even though sOs became the first player to win BlizzCon twice in 2015, actually we should say that Rain was better than him. I don't know anyone who believes that.
That's a rebadged Tex Yoda. You might find a used one. Not aware of any others available new, unless there's something from Unicomp available.
Oh I see we're balance whining against Protoss instead of Terran now, careful y'all don't get whiplash.
Yes, a Google search would tell you that they don't do RGB+blues.\n\nI suppose OP could buy a K65 LUX and pay someone to mod it to blues, but seems like a waste.
I don't remember anyone saying that then, I think sOs and herO (even Classic?) had claims to that title that were as good as Rain's at the time. 
Nerchio vs Zest, I think it was game 2
https://youtu.be/rUG_SuzgaCo?t=1883
Fair points, nice arguing with you :)
PiG
Going on strike from work is a [Federally protected](https://www.nlrb.gov/strikes) act under the National Labor Relations Act, and employee protections are particularly strong in California.\n\nI find it incredible that you thought it was a good idea to brag in advance about your intent to violate Federal employment laws, opening up whichever company is unlucky enough to have hired you to the liability of having this post used against them in lawsuits.
Blues are for when you don't know any other humans.
ah, StarCraft 2, NesTea was a world champion player's name :)
Rotti just told at least 35k people at once that Rain was once the best Protoss in the world at SC2, so I felt obligated to come back here and apologize. :)
Cloudflare's site says:\n\n> More than 5 percent of global Web requests flow through Cloudflare's network\n\n-- https://api.cloudflare.com/\n\nWhere did you get 60% from?
Finding out that you're being rushed by the Zerg opponent six seconds later with your first reaper is too harsh.  See e.g. soO vs TY.
Of course, it's a common strat. Scarlett did one against Maru recently I think.
Noppoo Choc Mini is $80, is there something wrong with it?
There's a Noppoo Choc Mini with Gateron Clears for $80, I use it.
Maybe Corsair K65 LUX? Wouldn't normally recommend a gaming keyboard but it's probably nearby you already. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.de/Corsair-CH-9000228-Performance-Multi-Colour-Mechanische/dp/B015C9Y658
Training your touch typing sounds like a better use of time to me; those keys shouldn't be difficult to reach.
Share some replays?\n\nThe thing that helped me the most: pick a build (for me it was a 8-9 mins 200/200 roach-ravager maxout), play it in custom games with no opponent until you can do it reliably, really learn the timings and benchmarks in it so you know where you are in it.  There's no way you should be in plat if you can build 200 supply of roaches in 9 mins.
Yup, with 1v1
I play games and it feels more comfortable to have my mouse closer to my left hand (on wasd), rather than to have a useless numpad in the way.
How can you get something for $89 if your max budget is $30?
That all sounds good.  18 hatch 18 pool will get in trouble against early reapers etc so most people do 17/17.  There's no easy answer about when to build drones vs roaches, it depends what your scouting tells you.  All I can really say is that you want to build as few roaches as possible while saturating three bases, but that may be anywhere from 5-20 depending on what you're seeing.
Another piece of news: Nerchio and Elazer knocked Solar out of the BlizzCon group stages at a time when Solar looked like a Top 2 Zerg.
Ohh thanks :)
Classy, thanks for doing that.
Try a good early hellion into hellbat timing build.  
Watch the Neeb matches! There is an insane comeback during the KESPA Cup final match. It was the first foreigner win in a Korean SC2 tournament ever.\n\nShowtime vs Nerchio -- game 1 of this series -- is my favorite game in LOTV so far: https://youtu.be/LBQ0VBbeNTE\n\nAlso, ByuN vs Dark Blizzcon final on King Sejong Station.
Mainly ZvP. And perhaps ZvZ? People sometimes throw in a few hydras during roach wars, perhaps they'll add more now.
No, it doesn't happen to me.
We've had a report of that here:\n\nhttps://github.com/keybase/client/issues/6137\n\nIf that's from you then it's just you, but if it's not then it isn't.  :)\n\nWe're looking at it now.
TvT is surely the least volatile mirror matchup..
I'd get single evo ranged +2 in ZvP and ZvZ, and double evo ranged and carapace +2 in ZvT. Melee upgrade is special tactics, for if your lings are a core component of your army as opposed to just runbys.  
I.. think you're cheating. Why would you expect positive feedback on that here?
To be fair one of them was literally epic.
> behind the mineral line of the main?\n\nYeah, that one.  Splitting up doesn't sound good.
They don't have the features OP asked for, right? I think K65 is TKL but only reds, and HyperX is blues but not TKL.
Without commenting on your numbers, it is normal for DSL to be sold in such a way that you're competing with your neighbors over shared bandwidth, that's how it works.
Yes, you can just use it as a wrapper for an existing React site.
Dare you to post it to r/StarCraft with a title of "Kerrigan fan art"
Eh, I don't think anything that happened in 2017 has been disheartening? But 2016 sucked, no doubt. Really enjoying 2017 SC2.
I don't think anyone agrees that Rain was ever the best Protoss.
Nice.\n\nI wonder what was in the dropperlords.
No, probably not you.
I do hydras but I agree it's often not enough. Sometimes it's good to attack with ling bane early, then if they're massing void rays they won't have enough to defend.
I've had that issue for months, not new to latest patch.
Fixing the problem doesn't remove the months of private data sprayed around into public caches, so it's not being blown out of proportion.
same here :) ZX+2, and before that I think my family had ZX81
Are you sure the current model of Choc Mini has the non-standard space? I thought they moved to a standard one a few years ago.
well played :)
Gnome isn't a distro. They're all equal if you're running i3 though. Arch is lighter weight on disk space.
Check out the linux-dri-devel list and see what people are working on there.
There was no segfault because the program was accessing uninitialized memory inside its own allocation space.
Biggest tip is to just cancel and take a different base if your natural gets rushed with hatch first. Cancel late, after they've wasted money on the pylon etc.\n\nAlso, prepare for a void ray follow-up to the cannon rush, they always do that. 
:)
If it's for work, why do you need backlighting? And what kind of programming do you require?
I wrote "was ever the best Protoss", not "was the best Protoss ever". It's not a strawman, it's repeating your phrase.
Betting in StarCraft matches is kind of crappy, it encourages players to throw games and they have done so before, people here would probably rather if you just didn't do it.
Have you tried Qubes? This is what it's for.
Why 37-50?
Would be surprised if Jin Air takes any new players now, they seem done.
they could both still fly catching crazy lobs and shit. 4 years later, looks like work just to dunk it. 
So nice. Current dream for me is a checkerboard/chess themed set in g20 or other flat profile on an ortho board. Some day..
Yeah, similar issues here. Some of the keys are in the wrong position. Other ones have the wrong row profile, same thing with the numpad 7 you have. For some oem rando pbt caps, I was hoping that for the price, everything would be on point, but uh not quite.. Just try not to think about all the other dope sets you could have
But WHEN is dis??
2 topre keebs are the same price. Would you rather have your ideal layout, great keycaps and silencing on a keyboard that is too big, or good but not ideal layout on ideal size board that would probably need a silence mod? JIS realforce vs ansi hhkb (japanese layout hhkb mod keys are too small for me). 
Actually, BG had a stress fracture of the kneecap in '09, then got microfracture treatment. Not saying he won't be the same this season though
As far as the feels, I'm not sure.. but judging from youtube, I prefer the sound of silenced topre. MX clear rattle and ping have broken me
honestly, the fact that dye sub != doubleshot didn't even cross my mind cause I never hear about pbt doubleshot. thank you
Has anyone used g20s for longer than five minutes? 
Nice! QCs do not get enough love. They actually are quiet, have a high bump, and are dirt cheap. Not shitting on the zealios and mods, I'm into those too, but if the bumps on them are the appalachians then matias/alps switches are in the rockies somewhere (alps was too much for me to stomach here). Also, the dampening changes the tactility less than cherry mx type. A few people complained that it's hard to find caps and the ones that are stock are pretty much all ABS afaik so they definitely have a point, but there are plenty of AEKs to be had cheaper than SP keycap sets if you want to harvest some PBT keycaps/ old switches.  
The real plot twist,\n\nCarnegie Tech: "We do applied math." \n\nCarnegie Mellon: "We do applied math... and literally ALL of the abstract nonsense."\n\nHmm, can't decide if applied nonsense is better name for HoTT or mathematical finance.. *whistles, exits stage left*
yes
This was fascinating. It's ok y'all, remember not too long ago people would claim drinking tequila or whiskey made them a different kind of drunk than other spirits
Samesies again. I got a response saying they would replace the bad set, then radio silence which I guess is due to the new year. At $100, nah wouldn't do it again. But $50-$60? More of a preference thing 
How does it compare to the whitefox?
The fucking village idiom over here
And who are you again? A massdrop shill? Clack back, but I think you should disclose your connections to massdrop before being a dick for no reason. And acting as if you're some kind of authority... 
Thanks for the reply the other day, first of all. The right space finger gymnastics look horrible (much appreciated /u/rhinofeed, this video in particular is super helpful for gauging the unique layout). That said, I'm still caught in the Z70 thirst trap. Is there any reasonable way to move the spacebars left 0.5-1u with this pcb? Don't really care about the size of the space keys as long as they're like 1.75u at least
Constructivism in mathematics is a once niche and arguably justifiably ignored interpretation/selection of foundational axioms that has recently become more popular as computers become increasingly capable of handling/exploring the highly mechanical/synthetic/unreadable forms of mathematics inherent to actually constructing mathematical objects and dotting all those i's. As you would imagine, this is more difficult/restrictive than asserting the existence of certain mathematical objects or proving their existence indirectly. There are different degrees of constructivism. These range from math without the axiom of choice, which doesn't usually change much math that mostly describes finite stuff, to models where people insist that there is actually a largest natural number as a larger one hasn't been constructed in the universe yet. I personally won't live my life like this. A little infinity never hurt anyone *except for all those divide by zero rounding errors..
If I had perfect pec muscle insertions with no gap like that, I would never have bothered picking up a weight.
Regular season games are a pretty low quality sample, starters might not even be playing that night if someone tried to ask Pop 3 questions last time he was there. In the playoffs, they obviously play him last, when his most necessary teammates usually are looking older than the Spurs players and he's exhausted from putting the team on his damn back. And A/C.
This is another angle that might be considered in the quality-adjusted life year concept discussed in the operating on an aneurysm [benefit analysis](http://www.gwern.net/Statistical%20notes#operating-on-an-aneurysm). I don't think many people would trade prime, healthy years for late-life years with better technology, but would you rather be 40 in 2005 or 50 in 2015? The uncertainty that sort of defines the gist of your comment is gone, but still.
Are these really doubleshot and pbt? Cause it's white legends on black keycaps: https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1947
Trivial typo at 50*0.05=0.25. Interesting, I thought 3% was a bit extreme but it seems DALY discounting had been moved to this from 5%..
Hmm, given how slow people say evolution is (and the amount of DNA we share with ancient humans) maybe using our biological responses to ancestral conditions isn't such a bad proxy. I'd find it hard to believe that ~90% of the digestible calories from an animal are in the form of fats without some evidence. I completely agree that oils and nuts are contemporary sources of fats, but these aren't really plausible sources, imo, for the base of some consistently ketogenic early human diet. People may spend time being fueled by fat sources, but that doesn't many they're in ketosis..
Warped warped warped warped warped...
Ah, that is unfortunate. Thanks though :)
It really does seem that the relevant quantity is work. Are you saying that since the distance is constant that w= f over distance reduces to w = force?
Are the caps pbt?? :)
Keycap sets/switches/components for full size cost more. Programmability isn't as common on full size stock. I'm about to try to see how useful mouse keys are as a layer over the numpad. Cause as ppl said, the mouse situation with fs is not ideal lol\n\n
I know this is irrational, but Okafor didn't impress me at all when he played anyone with NBA size, especially on defense. The headlines describe him as a throwback brute, but my eye test said bruh, this ain't ever gonna be Shaq- probably not even Boogie. He has good post footwork and a soft touch, but I'm definitely not thinking his back-to-the-basket game is going to overwhelm NBA bigs. Anyone care to show me the light here?
Two weeks? Either this is the smallest quad tendon tear in history or this is the most optimistic report in the world. Quad tendon injuries are pretty serious and a full blown tear would be a career changer for a high-flyer like BG. Like did anyone else notice Kyrie randomly falling and hobbling still yesterday? Similar injury (patellar tendon) and this is many months later
It's funny that the shots that the Warriors need to take are in the deadzone. 
where the typeheaven?
topre variable: gimmick or useful feature?
It's thin pexon lube ;P 
what switches in that iso aek?
Ah alright makes sense 
I think I missed the point here. In the abstract, the authors say:\n\n>We show that when agents cannot be sure of their own future one-period discount rates, then hyperbolic discounting can become rational and exponential discounting irrational.\n\nNecessary and sufficient conditions for rationality are not provided initially, but we are given the necessary condition of time consistency. Later, they say:\n\n> If Suzy’s discount rates behave according to the stochastic model we are about to give, asymptotic hyperbolic discounting is both time consistent and stochastically stationary, and thus Suzy is rational; exponential discounting, by contrast, fails to be time consistent, and so should be regarded as irrational.\n\nSo, assuming the authors understand logic better than I do, time consistent and stochastically stationary is our working definition of rational. Then the obvious question becomes "what is the relationship between present and future discount rates?". The example they give is a geometric random walk, where the successive (identically distributed) discount rates are correlated. This is reasonable, but to what extent? Certainly not the independent case, else the "locally rational" generalization admits so many behaviors that their conclusion is uninteresting. Put in terms of the example the authors gave: a reasonable human might say Suzy is rational if Suzy's psychological state is a signal with some noise, but probably wouldn't if Suzy's psychological state is indistinguishable from noise. \n\nI found useful:\n[Some Common Confusions about Hyperbolic Discounting](http://kelley.iu.edu/riharbau/RePEc/iuk/wpaper/bepp2008-11-rasmusen.pdf)\n[Thaler source](http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_1/FINANCE%20Advances%20in%20Behavioral%20Finance,%20Volume%20II.pdf)
I use a similar POM set but it has legends on it :P off centre spacebar isnt too bad
You might wanna look at some OG Cherry beige sets if you don't mind  doubleshot ABS since it has the colours you want and QWERTZ is cheap and common for that.
Yep! pm me if you want to tade
Switches?
<:
I didn't down vote, I just don't agree with the cap to price ratio here.
<3
TX75 
:( I want it all
I've got a load of 1u jelly poms if you're interested pm me. (about 200)
It's my first time lubing a full board properly so I'm fairly happy with how it turned out. 
Tactile greys are awesome <:
That's what happens when you go with £5 Chinese transparent stabs instead of £40 zeal transparent stabs 
It would be to do with your recording software more than the mic.
                                                                  https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/5wzkgw/euuk_h_ducky_one_iso_w_paypal/
1800 pls trade with me 
Finally :D
I've got a 60% that currently has clicky aristotle switches in it. I can easily replace the stems to another tactile one such as gateron brown or cherry brown or grey (greys and clears have the same stem). PM me if you're interested.
Now make a board like that.
Not the ISO version :P
It's $30, it's worth more than that just for scrap parts. You can clean it up fairly easily by following the spill guide on the wiki if something was spilled on it.
Trust me I want it but I defo don't have the cash for that haha 
+1
I guess but what ergonomically advantage does this have over a standard 60% split board that can be split and put together too? 
You got your timestamp brackets the wrong way round :P
<3
Looking to get the plates made from lasermasters, regarding the rest I'm currently looking for some companies. If you've got any recommendations let me know :P
Better.
I'd take that offer in an instant absolutely love the look of the TX84
A lubed switch and unlubed switch feels different regardless of what switch it is. I don't think the lube would wear off for a year or two 
:( 
I mean that's doable but that's gonna cost more lol 
holy shit
Pming
Ahh I like abs doubleshot over pbt since it kinda cushions the bottom out still wanna try them out
Buy it and you can have keyboard porn at your fingers.
the fuck is that 
So you can have a wonderful lightshow
Yes it would support it then :) thanks for the info 
newphonewhodis
Gotta list a price.
that bag though love it
Only about 756 switches.
WHY IS THAT THERE, I put all my artisans on my TX75 as a joke and took a picture to show how dumb my split spacebar looked but yeah it's a gold tx75
Also sounds like you have a noise gate on your microphone so the sound just sounds wrong and each stroke is partially cut off.
It's a POM spacebar from an OG pom set. I've had to stick some paper on the inside to make sure it fits properly and in taking it off and on I think I may have fucked up the stab. I need to relube the stabs I think since the space bar seems to rattle a bit. I strongly prefer the lubed sound myself.
want those aero mods so bad but I dont have a HHKB :(
dafuq
First question is why on earth specifically low profile kailh switches?
If you'd make all the imgur images into a single album I feel like it would be far better :P
Yes please.
Going to be a simple sandwich style case, [similar to this](https://www.mechkeys.ca/product/m84-aluminum-ps2avrgb/)
Gimme...
Most 60% boards just have a standard layout. You should be able to use basically any set as it doesn't have anything nonstandard. You just have to make sure it's standard 104/108 key.
english pls man
Needs a bit more balancing.
Maybe! Just putting it out there for now. 
yea but it's not possible to put them together xD 
I have genuine cherry stabs idk why I felt the need to use these transparent ones. The enter and backspace sound fine it's only the spacebar that's rattling 
damn.
Honestly its preference. Do some research on material and profiles before you just buy the prettiest one.
Same here.
You can just solder it back on or contact the person you bought it from and ask if they'd accept a return or if they can contact OCO for you.
what exactly do you mean by tray? do you mean mounting plate?
[ugh idk](http://cooldigital.photography/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/21.jpg)
Not exactly a fair sound comparison unless you've got them both in the same case :/
There are many different layouts, GMK has the capability to produce many different size caps. They're not even including ISO in the base set...
low compatibility high price :/ 
Idk what happened but http://i.imgur.com/cZNY9UA.jpg that image is of my keebs not whoever else it says there 
Prototypes coming soon, we're doing a bit of redesign on the PCB.
Might want to add some deets about what the Gherkin is.
Entirely possible just extremely unlikely for this project but 100% will be on the next one but a few months left till that happens ;).
Apparently cherry OG dye subs are better but I've never had a chance to try those so I couldn't say although epbt/gateron caps are defo good.
You don't have to. The keyboard is hotswappable so you can take out the switches very very easily and change around the layout to your hearts desire. I've changed the layout 3 times so far and it's taken less than 3 hours each time.

What did you make him exactly?
PM'd you yesterday :)
So many options 
One of the times in life I'm glad to be single :^)
/u/yiancar is handling the PCB fabrication so you'd have to ask him who exactly. Plate has already been printed so as long as those two line up we should be all set. 
Yes it is, just putting it out there for now incase I get some good trade offers. 
Well then you're in luck, /u/Arkhae said he'd be able to run an SMD Gateron switch group buy alongside this and I assume you'd be able to order in specific quantities of 1. 
I'll pm you later today :)

I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find a rotating plate somewhere and stick it on the bottom of the case but I doubt its a feature many people would want.
Due to the size of the PCB a separate controller was required for the lights

Pretty much, proper safety precautions is the best thing to do.  \nAs someone who does a decent amount of soldering at work anything with lead free is a pain in the arse to work with and requires more working time, which imo is large factor between either option.  \nSo using lead based solder and finishing faster will probably end up being a positive as well.
Props for getting it all working. The minivan's hole design can make for a very tricky first soldering project. Looks to me you were a little timid with the iron, needs some more heat and its more of a heat the pad and switch pole at once... then add solder in as it melts to the hot metal. A lot of people end up with balls of solder on the switch post from trying to touch solder and iron to the switch all at once.  \n\nLeave it alone for now, come back in a few months or after a few more soldering projects and you'll be able to come back to this and give it a tune up.
I picked up [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/937D-SMD-Soldering-Hot-Iron-Station-Digital-Adjustable-w-5-Tips-Japan-Heater-/381273992130?hash=item58c5b36bc2:g:hVkAAOSwLnBXXh0-) relatively cheap soldering station since I was planning to build a few boards and I couldn't be happier with it. Digital temp control is great, and it uses Hakko tips which are easy to find anywhere. 
You might want to redo the join that have big blobs and add a tiny bit more to some of them but looks pretty good other then that.
[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1821 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/07485)
Got them all soldered in. Tested them as well and they appear to be working. Now I just need some key caps. 
don't forget to heat the pad so that the solder can liquify to the shape of it and make a more secure connection
Look at mister helpful right here. Doesn't look terrible for a first timer to my eyes.
Wouldn't even think of it. 
There's a difference between pointing out flaws and shitting in someone's face ;)
Thanks for the advice. I think all the keys are working. Though I might try to redo some of the soldering. Clean it up a bit. Unless that's a bad idea. 
What soldering gun did you end up using?   I will be soldering some switches for the first time so I am always curious to other folks experience doing it for the first time.     I've seen others mentioned that the learning curve is fairly easy but I think there is always some nerves doing something for the first time.       \n\n
I know how to solder very well and my first solder joints looked a lot worse than this.\n\nBesides, have you been born a master at soldering? That's how you come across.
Good plan. While I have you here... how's the addon supplies order coming? 
not a bad idea at all, just be careful.\n\nI'm not responsible for you fucking up btw
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JZ6HNB8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nI picked this up from amazon a few months ago.  Its pretty basic but did the job. If I'm going to put together more boards though I think I'll invest in something a bit fancier.
My understanding is the fumes from lead-free solder are worse than from lead based solder.  \nSo for a hobbyist who takes the proper precautions, it is most likely better to use lead based.  \nI would say if you can use lead based, do that as it is much easier to work with(so less used, less exposure).
Thanks for letting me know.  
Yeah, you're right. Fumes aren't a concern for lead-based. They need to be addressed regarldess. Just gotta wash the lead remnants off your hands before feeding your infant child or whatever. 
Thanks everyone for the advice.  
[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9050 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/72947)
It's really not bad. \n\nI actually started with lead free solder and it was tough to get the pad, pin, and solder all heated the right amount to get the solder to flow in nicely so the first PCB I did ended up with scorch marks but was totally functional. \n\nI switched to leaded solder and it was a billion times easier, looked nicer, and didn't do any of the annoying things the lead-free solder did... \n\nSo, I recommend starting with the toxic stuff and moving to lead free if you think it's important to you.

Post this question in Geekhack if you don't get an answer here.  The originative folks are pretty responsive. 
I just tried removing all of the other things from the dock but it keeps "recent" and shows music and recent options that still require poking into :(
Is that a kit with everything or just case/plate/pcb?
I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. This should have been the highest risk on the Otto radar. They should have actively mitigated it IF IT IS UNTRUE... otherwise they are assholes. 
* Use VPNs if you do any kind of torrenting/streaming borderline stuff.\n* Don't use public wifi without encrypted VPN for any account you give a shit about.\n\nFor these two, the only massively important part is finding a trustworthy VPN. Of course any shills or marketing folks will say their VPN is the best because they don't log and are foreign to the USA or something like that. \n\nIf they don't do any logging/monitoring, they can't enforce billing or protect against attacks so they definitely do some monitoring and tracking. If they are in the USA, they may try a warrant canary. If they are not in the USA, the CIA has already hooked into their data center or ISP but they can claim to be secure because they may think they are. I think the weakest link is in the vendor layer for most of these things that are legit. \n\n Bottom line, I hope your threat model doesn't get to actors with state-level capability. \n\nOnce you get past that, just make sure to use an open source OprnVPN client instead of the custom clients. You'll be fine. 
Borgbackup with encryption and append-only. 
I know Gentleman already replied with plate mount being "the right switch". From looking at the PCB, it definitely supports PCB-mounting because (a) it has the 2 holes for PCB mounting pegs and (b) the 40percent.club pictures are mostly of the PCB-mount style builds.  Unless the "updated PCB" doesn't have the peg holes, I'd stick with PCB mount. \n\nThe plate is just made of PCB material so I'd try to get all the extra rigidity I could by using PCB-mount switches which also click into the plate... i.e. all PCB mount switches. 
Never tried Jackett with Sonarr and don't have a Radarr evaluation setup yet to even try. 
From what I undertand of the vulnerability, it couldn't be directed. It was just leaking memory occasionally when the buffer overrun was executed. There was no way to make it pull Uber users or Yelp passwords... some of those things may have been exposed, but it's not like the yahoo credentials sort of hack. 
I just mean the plain silver one, not the carbon fiber.
This is quite a bit of pondering and I think the baseline needs to be set by your threat model. What do you risk by unlocking your device for the customs folks? It's obviously an insulting and invasive action but so is taking pictures of you through your clothes when you board an airplane and we still let them do that because we want to fly places. \n\n### Light weight\n\nUnlocking a device using a guest account or limited account should satisfy most concerns. If they ask about another account, it's your boss or your cousin or you dad. You don't know the password. Whatever. \n\nPrep: create a user account with little access. Set the login screen to require typing the username and password rather than presenting icons. \n\nWeakness: can't use FDE because as soon as you unlock the guest account, the drive is accessible and if they switch to surveillance tools at that point, your data is theirs. Can still use encrypted containers/images but they're annoying. \n\n### heavy weight\n\nUse FDE to encrypt the drive. Password 1 decrypts your real stuff and password 2 decrypts the decoy OS. I recall this being possible with Truecrypt but since the project died i haven't messed with it. \n\nPrep: spend a bunch of time learning how to do this with Veracrypt or some other truecrypt branch. Hope you did it right because one mistake in key generation or password selection and the whole thing was pointless. Make it look as much like bitlocker as you can. \n\nWeakness: it will likely look much more fishy than the typical Bitlcoker/FileVault that they see all day and once they raise flags, you will wait in Guantanamo while they crack away at your real password. Furthermore, if you pass the checkpoints multiple times and they are interested in you, they can run cryptanalysis on the ciphertext drive images that they've pulled while you weren't in possession and see which part of the disk hasn't changed and which oarts have. Possibly identify the header region for the real OS and start cracking away at it. \n\n### practical solution\n\nThe happy medium is to travel without your sensitive data. Move it all to another device and leave it at home. Wipe your laptop and or bring a chrome book or some cheap laptop to get through the trip. \n\nPrivacy now costs money. For traveling abroad, buy a phone when you arrive and bring a cheap computer with the absolute bare minimum of information. No data, no credentials, no bookmarks, no Tor.  Or hide Tor. 
CENTRAL?!
I was like 30 seconds from ordering the clueboard parts to make one with the maximized bottom row. When I saw aluminum case was coming, I held off. Instead, I built an alps64 from old AEKs and a Planck for about the same price. \n\nIm glad I did that, because I leaned that the Planck bottom row has entirely too many keys and the 60% AEK64 doesn't require nearly as much function stuff as a 40%. I doubt I'll do a split space on anything larger than 40% in the future. \n\nStill want to build a clueboard but it'll be a more traditional bottom row than I would have built 6 months ago. 
That is fantastically helpful information! I will try with one of my other spare switches. 
Backup only data files. If you're restoring binaries or reinstalling from a compromised source (whether it's your backup or a shady website), you're just increasing the risk for no reason. \n\nBackup data; reinstall Mac OS X from a legit source; reinstall applications from the App Store or first party downloads; copy the data from the backup to your computer and treat it all as untrusted. \n\nThat last part, if you had a bunch of word documents with macros or something that is known to be risky, either simplify them to ascii/rtf or don't copy them back. \n\nBackups are really for restoring after a drive failure. If something malicious attacked your computer, restoring from a backup or even using aspects of it increase the risk of reinfection. 
I've used both the function layer with shift and raise lower. Raise lower was quicker to adapt to. \n\nOn my JD45, the numbers aren't across the top. Instead it's a keypad with 1 on V and 9 on Y. That took forever to get used to and I still miss a lot because of the staggered keys. Not recommended. \n\nI actually only ever plug my small boards into my MacBook. It's annoying to have 2 keyboards but I love the trackpad so much that I'm not ready to switch to an iPad Pro. \n\nHope that helps. 
This doesn't jeopardize anything and it's just a guy stealing trade secrets or being completely clueless about how optics work when leaving one company and immediately engaging in the same work on your own. \n\nHe didn't do enough to assure his previous employer that he wasn't stealing the work and information they funded. 
Anybody have a design for a mechanical keyboard that has a return lever like typewriters?  That might add some satisfaction to finishing a line of code. 
You mean just like my last one?
I've built many VPN servers using all sorts of technologies. They require quite a bit of specialized knowledge to make them secure. Following the guides on configuring OpenVPN will get it working, but in a pretty loose state. Following a hardening guide is likely to break the OpenVPN or StrongSwan service or network configuration. Then it's learning time to figure out the balance that is right for your needs. \n\nThis exercise is immensely valuable but requires a lot more time and energy to get it working, keep it working, and keep it up-to-date. \n\nIt is a great way to be sure your VPN isn't logging you. Back to my original point, Amazon will be logging your network and disc access/usage in order to monitor and bill you appropriately. This prevents your ISP or public wifi from spying on you, but if you torrent stuff or engage in illegal activity, it is trivial for law enforcement to determine that Amazon owns the IP and Amazon knows who is using it at any given time. 
I like how they played on most shows having limited cast trope and then blew it up. Like family guy often has Glen and Peter in the navy as twenty-somethings or whatever just because they want to explore the interaction in a different environment. They ended the flashback with "hope we live next door someday" or something but a lot of shows abuse the casting this way. \n\nLegion seemed to be but then after you come to terms with ignoring how dumb it would be to have co-enablers in the same therapy sessions, they're pull the unreliable narrator card. 
And Sonarr is all .NET so your Python adventure was better matched to your interests.

In OS X, it's the "command" key which is used for copy/paste and many other common shortcuts. Since it's based on unix, ctrl-c is the break sequence for many programs. Command was used for shortcuts so they could keep the control key dedicated to its original purpose for the most part. (Of course there are more and more deviations as OS X evolves.)\n\nAnyway, as a mostly-Mac user, I'd never survive without command/win on the default layer.

I love complications that use time travel correctly. Dark sky does a good job going into the future but doesn't record your local reps for the past. It's something I've looked for a couple of times but it just grays out. \n\nIt's a bit complicated because if you take a flight from Canada to Florida, your watch rolling back should be like 90, 90, 90, 30, 30, 30... rather than just rolling backwards through Florida temperatures. \n\nNot that it makes a big difference, but it could be an interesting little log of your daily outdoor temperatures.

When you've purchased one and thought "I'd prefer it be different." Realize you can make the thing you prefer. Then make it and realize you're not a professional human interface designer and have a dozen more changes. Then build that one. Then get curious about the tiny boards and build some of those. They're not particularly practical. Then you realize you have enough spare parts to build another board so you get the missing case. Also there's a new round a Zealios. ....
This is really the crux of the case. WTF is more horrific than child porn and why are they doing it? 
Those homing keys are scoop+bar looking in the diagram. Is that the intention for the final order?
Yep. This is a particularly clear case where discovery and version control will resolve it. 
Even for-profit businesses can run intentionally inefficiently in order to have happier staff or a stronger community. The Amazon/Walmart approach to capitalism isn't a requirement. It's a problematic side-effect. I'd say the huge majority of businesses in the United States do a lot of activities that detract from "making as much money as possible".
Fn keys change the signal sent from the board to the computer. They cannot be controlled by the computer unless you can reprogram the keyboard. \n\nModifiers (shift, alt, ctrl, win) are sent to the computer for processing. You could switch ctrl and alt or b and t, but not fn. 
So to answer your tile question: Most people have figured out the exact bare minimum they can do to keep getting paid.  After a few months of this routine, any slight modification to either their effort or their cash flow is seen as maximum insult. 
Best signs prison labor can buy. 
Sadly, this sounds like you need a medical professional. There is no science behind any particular layout or switch type that will help any physiological issue. \n\nSwitching to ortholinear would probably slow you down enough that you could recover. \n\nAdding a wrist rest typically just allows people to type longer while accumulating wrist and arm strain so there is guaranty that it will help. \n\nStopping typing fully for a few weeks, go on a long camping trip or something. Come back with fresh arms.

Knowing oracle, it's just a fleet of consultants copy/pasting cells all day for $300,000,000 per month.

What limits did you hit with the GoN software to make you switch to QMK? 
I probably should have been more concerned for her safety when embattled with gunfire and such. I thought Logan was just being polite when he told her to get behind him when charging the guys with automatic weapons. 
Sorry but I don't think the capability exists in that board to do a swap of that nature. \n\nI actually started on the programmable board path because I was sick of Windows keyboards having the wrong alt/win(command) order. After building a few, I determined the capslock key is the best place for function. \n\nI'm going to build a custom with the HHKB layout and see if the 60% layout doesn't require a fn key on the left. \n\nSo anyway, programmable boards are awesome, but expensive.

And if the post-yuri world has a legit 2U spacebar, I'll buy 150 of each color in this set and N9 and probably more because I support convex spacebar!

> too large to still be moved on the desk \n\nWhat purpose does moving the pad serve? I have my entire desk covered by a desk pad and love it. If I write stuff, I do so on a legal pad or notebook. Otherwise my hands and mouse and keyboard are enjoying the comfy mat.

Are you saying that Laura only had adamentiun claws and not full skeleton playing? I missed that... \n\nHe got plating after he was over 100 years old. She already had it at like 10 years old. \n\nIf she got the full skeleton, she wouldn't get taller anymore?
Run all the validations locally in JavaScript to guide the user as much as possible. \n\nOn the back-end, fail anything where a user has overridden the JS validations using DOM manipulation or a proxy. These failures should not confuse the user who is circumventing the guidance-level validations. \n\nAlso save incrementally as they work through a long form. Just to be user friendly instead of user hostile. It sounds like the form you're referencing is particularly user-hostile.

This stuff is far too nuanced for internet strangers to provide useful information. Needs a steady hand or you'll have to distuptively replace infrastructure while people are trying to get their jobs done... or drag the technical debt along for decades. \n\nFind someone to be the director long term because consultants can get you started but pivoting and resource allocation are long-term needs for the organization. The IT shop needs to grow with the org. 
It's a custom plate. Part of the Pawn group buy on GH. The switches fit in pretty snugly but don't snap in. This is a problem for a couple of keys near the controller where there is enough wire below them to pop them up occasionally. \n\nI think it's due to the thickness of the plate, but I could be wrong. \n\nI may need to just get a new plate cut from Lasergist with cherry-only switch holes in the 1.2mm thickness. \n
Bull run occoquan train goes from the centreville/manassas border down to a bit south of Burke lake park. It's like 30+ miles long with a trail head every few miles. My favorite trail ever. \n\nPrince William forest park has a few loops that range from 5 to 30 miles. There are fire roads throughout the park, but the trails can get pretty steep and technical. \n\nManassas battlefield park has some wooded trails around the cleared fields but it's not as interesting. \n\nLake accotink park used to have a good trail loop although it's been partially paved and one segment goes through a neighborhood. There's a connecting trail to rt 50 that has segments of paved and others with just gravel. (18 miles or so to cover the whole thing) Could probably use a jogging stroller the whole way (just to give you an idea of accessibility). \n\n
Do you have pictures of the build?  Is it an R4 PCB?
Edit: I read your message wrong. I agree that is the biggest problem 
Also went from blues to clears, love it
They have those as well! They're strictly the magnetic adapter part so you can use your own cable. Here is one I found really quick: https://www.ebay.com/itm/371807776322

Also planning on doing the same. I got my iPhone 6 64gb unlocked through T-Mobile and the process was a piece of cake. Once the phone is paid off, you request the unlock, T-Mobile sends you an email saying you're good to go, you restore the iPhone on iTunes and then a message pops up saying you're phone is unlocked. Super easy
Supposedly sometime this year, but it's pretty much guaranteed that it won't ship until 2018 due to the SA backlog at SP

Where does it say that? All it says in the fine print of the offer is that the remaining balance becomes due if you cancel wireless service entirely. Just trying to think of options to be able to upgrade to the next iPhone in a year again if it is a significant redesign. 
Yep, got through until the very last page and was about to hit submit order when the page timed out lol. Not entirely surprised though, I'm having flashbacks to the iPhone 6 launch. 
I believe it's specific to the Minivan and Roadkit only, so what you see is what you get and nothing more
Thanks! Will silver Roadkits be coming back in the future in another round? Looking to get one to match my Minivan!
Yes that's exactly what it means! I'm super excited to finally pick up a set as well
Just picked one up at [FatBoyTactical](http://fatboytactical.net/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=21&products_id=411). They have a few of the stripped Anderson lowers (4 left right now), and 17 of the stripped lowers with integrated trigger guard

Yes definitely call back. Was wondering about this as well and the second CSR I talked to basically said the first CSR didn't input my trade in details correctly and I would NOT be getting the trade in promo unless I cancelled and redid the entire thing...
I would check out Polar's products. I know that their desktop utility allows you to export all data into a spreadsheet and has pretty good logging/tracking abilities and even offers data analysis as it is more geared towards athletes 
Additionally, I've found a very nice looking dock charger! Looking to pick this one up also: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H3WHNEI/ref=s9_simh_gw_g107_i2_r?ie=UTF8&fpl=fresh&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=JGE0A20XE1A73MXTV3T2&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=6aad23bd-3035-4a40-b691-0eefb1a18396&pf_rd_i=desktop
I used a similar [Teflon lube](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030BFEM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (although in a squeeze bottle) to lube my Zealios. Works great and was really cheap! If you're gonna go with the aerosol, definitely spray into a bowl first and use a paintbrush to distribute 
Would be interested in 100 of each type!
Pretty similar to standard climbing quickdraws. They're SUPER cheap at sports places like REI! [Black Diamond Standard Dogbone Sling](https://www.rei.com/product/100467/black-diamond-standard-dogbone-sling)
Most likely need to flash it first. And for the record, you can just use a paperclip to short out two switch pads on the pcb to test instead of soldering on a switch :). Also important to note that you probably should test pcbs this way instead of soldering on a switch first because many sellers will replace a defective pcb, but won't if you've already soldered something onto it.

[Signature Plastics](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/) is the company that produces the Granite keysets designed by /u/matt3o. IIRC as of right now there isn't a set date or anything, but I'm sure it'll be announced here as soon as more details are released
Looking to get into the new WRX!
Looks like the 1u | \\ key is included in the [common kit](http://cdn6.bigcommerce.com/s-ktpi93fl/products/215/images/824/commonkit__21662.1475783089.1280.1280.jpg?c=2)
I believe the deal is really about the same, considering this doesn't include a MOE grip and the GraniteRidge deal does. MOE grips usually can be found for $13-15. Great deal either way.
Also Diamond Supply Co, Obey, and Hershel 
Currently the lowest price its ever been, according to [CamelCamelCamel](http://camelcamelcamel.com/Walkers-Game-Ear-Razor-Electronic/product/B01AAH8CMA)
Also would be super interested in an HHKB layout version! I've been waiting to throw my money at you ;)
I picked up a stripped Anderson lower from [FatBoy Tactical](http://fatboytactical.net/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=21&zenid=db8132a661303e1480f50771dbcdea4f) for $52 just last week and it arrived in 2 days at my FFL here in Milpitas. Check out RMB Enterprises in Milpitas - Rob is a great guy and charges $40 transfer fee + $25 DROS. 
So excited for SA Oblivion. Instant buy for me and I think I'll look great on my space grey M65-A 
As long as the 80% is built/milled out before July 1, 2018, you are able to engrave your own serial number/identifying details of your choosing WITHOUT having to go through the CADOJ (you can make it up). Anything built after July 1, 2018 date, you will have to apply for a serial number through the CADOJ - though I suppose they would have to somehow prove that it was milled/built after that date. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nInfo taken from 80% Arms website:\n> If you engrave a serial number of your choosing into your completed 80% lower prior to Jul 1, 2018, you will not be affected by this law and you do not need to notify any government agency that you built a firearm.  In other words, you can make up any serial number you want (as long as it meets ATF's definition of a serial number), engrave it on your receiver, and this will satisfy California’s legal requirement. You do not need to apply to the state, or tell them what your serial number is. Your lower can still legally remain completely off the radar. The important thing is you MUST engrave your serial number before July 1, 2018 to take advantage of this benefit. After July, 2018, the law changes for the worse. If you build an 80% lower after July 1, 2018, you must FIRST apply to the California DOJ for a serial number, pay a fee, and they will then assign a serial number that you must apply to your firearm. In this case, you can’t choose your own serial number and your serial number will be in the state government’s data base. If you want to avoid falling under this law, make sure you engrave your own serial number to your completed 80% lowers before July 2018.

I ended up trying out the Mill-Max sockets that you have to solder in and they seem to work pretty well. Was too afraid the try the Holtites - how do you like them? Also, did you use anything for LEDs? Still trying to figure out what sockets will work for hot swappable LEDs directly on the PCB instead of SIP sockets.
R4 is supposed to be [around $300](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5u16ec/newsbuying_minivan_and_roadkit_going_on_sale_on/ddqlgx2/) unfortunately\n\n*crying intensifies*
Yeah, he can order [4 1.75 blanks](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-1-75-space-pack-of-4/) here for $6 instead, granted that's if he doesn't mind having a blank key. A small trade off, I suppose 
Well looks like I **have** to buy one now. Thanks for the hard work! Minivan + Roadkit using QMK = incredible. /u/evangs will roadkits be going up for sale soon? Will you have the same case colors as the preorder?
That is definitely not how it works...
Bought switch tester from /u/mgsickler
I believe tax will be upfront, but I'm seeing a lot of different answers regarding the additional costs if we want to upgrade to the 7+ or 128GB versions. Not sure if that cost will be up front also or spread out over the 24 month EIP. 
Bought SA key from /u/busgamer7394
Sorry already sold - forgot to update the thread. Also was not willing to ship
I believe that in order to do the trade in promotion, the phone must be bought from T-Mobile and not directly from Apple
Sold my 2012 rMBP and built a hackintosh with the money since I was just using it as a desktop replacement anyway. Been using it for the past few years (originally had OS X Mavericks on it and upgraded to Yosemite and now El Capitan with no major issues). Much better specs than the rMBP and couldn't be happier! I also picked up a cheap used MBA for portable computing and love the combo. 
Came across this as I was looking at new products at SHOT show. The really interesting part is their new takedown pin, which includes a "reload" setting which cracks open the action *ever so slightly*, while also limiting forward pivot. Looks pretty promising. 
Some do data and power, and some only do power. You just gotta be careful to buy the correct one. Usually sellers will make the distinction

I used to have them in 19" and would not recommend them in this size as they're very prone to bends if you hit a pothole. They're definitely nice ultralight wheels and if you do pick them up, definitely get them in 17" or 18"

Exactly this. A CC will not look very substantial compared to your undergraduate institution - *especially* coming from UCB. I'm one of the student organizers for CSUEB PHAP, so feel free to PM me any questions you may have! I've been in the program since Winter 2016 and have been impressed with my experience so far.
Also considering this, but I was thinking...couldn't we possibly sell the iPhone 7 privately (while still continuing to receive the monthly bill credits from TMO), then just buy the iPhone 8 through Apple? Since we wouldn't be going through TMO, there is no new EIP.

I would strongly advise **against** applying for a CCW if you're in the Bay Area. You will most certainly get denied as there is pretty much zero chance of getting a CCW here. In the future, if you move to a place where you can *actually* obtain a CCW permit, you will have to answer "Yes" to if you've ever previously been denied a CCW permit - which I'm sure is a red flag. As others have said, you don't need a CCW to own a firearm here.
From my understanding, we can keep all evil features and avoid having to register as an AW if we changed to a fixed magazine setup by using something like the ARMagLock as long as the rifle is purchased before January 1, 2017. Whereas any AR purchased after that date cannot have ANY evil features at all and will have to be built featureless regardless if it has a fixed magazine or not. Does that sound right? \n\nLooking into building my first AR before 2017 if that's the case. 
2017 is really turning out to be an expensive year already
It can be used as a standalone calculator since it uses a CR2032 battery. When on battery mode, it will lock into calculator mode and turn off the backlighting
Ran into the same problem last night, can't recall the exact error but it was similar in the sense that I wasn't able to erase my Satan GH60. I was able to get everything working by force erasing using the command `sudo dfu-programmer atmega32u4 erase --force` 
Just ordered it, will keep you posted! 
I went to a local T-Mobile store at 4:30AM the day the iPhone 6 launched and was the first person in line. I had called the day before and they told me there was only one iPhone 6 in 64GB in space grey, so I knew I had to be first. Pretty chill experience, just read a book the entire time until 7AM. Not too many people showed up either - probably around 10-15 or so. Was in an out in about 10 minutes. Would definitely recommend trying AT&T over Apple stores, as long as you can confirm that they have what you want beforehand. My roommate did the same thing but with a Sprint store - same chill experience. \n\n\nI also waited in line for the iPhone 3G launch at the Apple store, which was crazy. Got there about 7AM and waited probably 5 hours in line. Never again...though Steve Wozniak was also in line, which was cool. 
Great info! Was wondering about this as well. I see that you only stickered one side of the stabilizer stems, but what about the switch stems? One side or both? 
Even better then! 
I believe that its guaranteed $650 as long as your phone is paid off/not broken/etc. If it were only "up to" $650, they would have released varying levels of trade in prices depending on if you had an iPhone 6 vs 6S, 16GB/64GB/128GB, regular iPhone or iPhone plus version - since its all regarded as the same, everything should get the full value as long as it meets the requirements. 
I'm assuming you'll want shine through keycaps to maximize the RGB lighting of your board, so I'd recommend [these](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/pbt-104-key-cherry-mx-keycap-set-backlit-doubleshot-white.html) or [these](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1330) backlit pbt keys

This WAS true of hackintoshes before, or if you're trying to hackintosh an already built desktop/laptop. You have to tailor the parts you buy to the idea that the computer is being built to be a hackintosh specifically. There are a lot of "golden builds," which are essentially builds that have previously been tested by others in the community and are pretty much guaranteed to work. I would highly suggest checking out [Tonymac X86](http://www.tonymacx86.com/buyersguide/june/2016) if you'd like to learn more! The only quirk I've had in my two years of owning my hackintosh is that I need to wait a little while (a couple weeks at best) once a new system update rolls around to see feedback from the community about any issues that may come up - and generally its all straightforward. Everything else works 100% just as it does on my Macbook Air. 
Not totally true, I've been doing my own research on the issue and I was able to source some sockets that fit and work totally fine in my Satan GH60 PCB. I'm waiting to try the sockets on some other PCBs to see how universal they really are.

Sadly I'm not sure how to proceed there. I'm a macOS user so when I programmed my Satan GH60 I used the command line and macOS doesn't natively have a "device not recognized popup." Maybe someone else can chime in! Though if you just soldered one switch on, I don't *think* that would have caused this issue. 
Looks like they just restocked! Mine is arriving at my local FFL here in the Bay Area on Wednesday (ordered it just last night). Super fast shipping! 
Confirmed 
Same here as well! Had two other phones delivered on launch day (32gb MB 7 and 32gb rose gold 7+), and both had the label created two days before they were delivered. So I'm expecting delivery Friday based on that, but I wouldn't complain if it was delivered sooner lol

Yeah man this looks bad, logos are completely off and in the wrong spots. I have two real base camp duffels and I HIGHLY recommend shelling out the cash for a real one. Its durable af and waterproof, plus TNF's lifetime warranty is incredible.

Does this kits have support for both layouts?\n
Absolutely interested!
I'm already looking forward to the Caravan, guess I'll add this to my list too!

Neat layout! Would love to see it in action.

keep your eyes peeled, the minorca pcb version comes out soon.
I would go for gateron switches, they are IMO better cherry clones, but that won't stop you, just choose what you think you'll like!
Define quality?  Ctrl alt and bunnylake have done way too many people dirty, and even admitted that they are running a pyramid scheme. I know it's not the most positive thing, but I like giving people a good laugh. My shitpost should be more keyboard oriented I guess.
perfecto, I was very worried there for a second, thanks so much.
Ah, that's pretty neat! For stickers I think a single switch in the same style would be cool.
This sub is dead, are you looking for /r/mechanicalkeyboards?
If you paint an orange yellow? Is it still an orange? 345

Before you really commit and do this, I would order some blanks like you said and see how it looks in real life first. I have seen a lot of sets that look great on paper, but never turn out as expected.
Looks like there is 3x 1.75u keys, a standard set only comes with one IIRC. But if you want to pick up some blanks, thats an option along with the standard set.
Here's one of my personal favorites.\n\nStop using up my oxygen.
they look great! \n\nkeep up the great work dude.
Well, you can't always win. I understand the dislike though. 
Honestly, I'm still not sure, I might just go for the stainless steel one to be safe. But I'll have to see when the new ones come out.
I saw one on mechmarket a little while back for a great price. It'll be hard, but not impossible.
I thought that was just dsa lightcycle, but either way, be on the lookout!
This sub is dead. I think you are looking for /r/mechanicalkeyboards.
I'm going to buy a skulthulu from a friend soon, so I didn't enter! You're doing a great thing, thanks op!
Sorry, but I have no idea, I don't use wrist rests.
less than a week, I really enjoy my minorca and my minivan! 
if he is your best man, go big or go home. I suggest topre.
Probably made him unlock it.
Dude, I wish I looked at this more in person, you make it look soooooo sexy dude.
I have the counter bookmarked
Its been said many times by ctrl alt and bunnylake that they will be shipping out the caps soon to the people. This still hasn't happened for some reason though. I'm not sure why it took so long, but I have 2 ideas. Either they just didn't ship them, or they never bought enough sets to ship.
purp
This sub is dead, are you looking for /r/mechanicalkeyboards?
Super unfortunate they didn't turn out the way they looked in renders.
Perfecto, thanks!
Damn, didn't know that. It's a beautiful board!
I thought she said damaged PS3 gene.
Lookin good, the caps remind me of space cadet or symbiosis.
jesus, that is nice.
shoot, I have an iso kit with white lettering and another key with a white arrow. All of the keys I ordered were the color blue.\n\nI literally ordered maybe 7 or 9 keys, I would hate to see them get delayed because of the lettering.
I love it! Nice original idea!
im proud
You can get custom colors from pmk, but it'll definitely cost a premium, but it is much better than spending thousands on a group buy that doesn't turn out good.
Personally,  the layout isn't my thing, but it looks great!
pls no more sa
I'm from the south, can confirm.
that is a cool little lego mac in the corner! Where did you get it?
I knew it would be the perfect chance to post it.
That's it, I'm buying a jd40
That's me!
Secondhand is the only option right now, but I would be on the lookout for new drops from /u/evangs.
This is shit, the other meme is really shit.
Thanks dude, my bad.
I ordered only blue keys, I'l ask 7bit though.
It's not weird if you like it.
clasick
lookin good! I love all 40% boards!
I need to go to a Monday night melee, I've been in DFW for my whole life and been playing melee for about a year now. Never been to a tourney.
I want to downvote these posts, but then I remember I'm on a sub that hates them. I feel like I'm on Facebook on this sub.
I used to be like this, now I've ordered so many things that I get a package every other day. Its like a guessing game to see what I get next in the mail.
Neato!
WHAT THE H*CK I AM A NICE YOUNG CHRISTIAN BOY! WATCH YOUR MOUTH MFER.\n
That was just a suggestion if this ever takes off, unless you want to wait until 2018, I would go for another profile. I like it though!
Bucking Springs would like to have a word with you.
neato!
I agree, one is enough my friend 
you have time, cancel the order and go back while you still can. I'm about to order my 3rd 40% board.
Is this a group buy? If so when will it ship?
Whatever you say dude.
perfecto, thanks\n
These looked so much better in renders, so disappointing to see them turn out like this.
aren't most things I post extremely stupid
find a SA commando 23 keyset, and match that shit right up.
Interesting
Yoshi is trash in Japan, keep that in mind.
sounds good man.
brb touching kumquat
pm'd\n
oh my god, rip wallet
Hmm, for a size like that, you could just get a 60% wrist rest, but if you want it to cover the whole board you will have to get a custom size or maybe find somebody already with a custom one. You can start a thread on /r/mechmarket
If you got it that way, then I would contact the guy who sold this to you. Because if it was already like this and he didn't mention it, that isn't acceptable IMO.
I second this
I'm jelly.
I understand what they are, I am asking what they mean
No, this is talking about round one, sold through control alt. They don't have the best track record when it comes to shipping things out on time, you should be good for the ones sold by OCo. Only time will tell though.
I see what you did there, HSP
Sounds good dude, thanks.
a month! jeez, that would be heaven for any group buy.
Ok, thanks dude.
I can't do ergo boards :(
Save yourself the trouble of owning it and send it to me ;)
Send it out of the house, cause it's 18 fucking years old.
yo yo, have you seen my shitpost my dude
There has always been shitposts before that.
Understood. I myself have been inspired by kumquats incredible work. the guy is awesome, and has a load of amazing keyboards that actually brought me into the game. I will keep that in mind, and create more funny, more keyboard related shitposts. \n\nThis should be a place where we can set aside our differences and just chill and look at keyboards.\n\nThanks for letting me know about this, and I type this in the least passive aggressive way possible.\n\n\n\nWho knew this would happen over a bee movie meme wew.
Bearguy is bestguy 
What's the fault in the first fc660c you got?
Can also look at Leopold Fc980c.
I don't know why people get so defensive and stuck up.\nI love RGB too.  Seems like some people treat their keyboards better than their partners--if they even have one.  But then again it seems like most people on these forums are rich and privileged anyway.
> RGB is tacky\n\n\n\nI mean, is it though?\n\n\nSome people just like LEDs, it's purely preference, just like switch choice.\n\n\nRGB doesn't HAVE to be a pulsating rainbow eyesore.
Leopold FC980C if you want a great toprekeyboard with that sweet thocky sound 
Agree to this. Google how to tether wifi from your laptop. Be careful when you download games/patches though. Your laptop may get flagged for high usage. Check out your school internet requirements if they have one. For my school, I can't use more than 10gb/day or 1gb/hr for 10 hours
Look at this link: http://majornelson.com/2015/06/19/buy-xbox-one-choose-a-game-for-free/?linkId=15007432
You could add sth to the conversation instead of staying in 1/25th of words.He hates the sound and if u see my post i write my opinion.I find RGB tacky and if i had to choose between LEDs or Real topre sound ,i would 10/10 choose the  real sound and feel.Am i not allowed to write my own opinion?If u like RGB thats fine but u dont have to answer every post defending it.
Like that's the thing, I don't give anyone shit for what their keyboard preferences are because it's just that - their preference. But straight up calling something bad? not 'I don't like this', just 'this is bad', it's simply ignorant, even further so saying something like 'RGB is tacky', because there's a ton of tasteful uses for RGB lighting.
That is not the real topre sound. I used to have a novatouch with PBT caps and the sound was awfull.I am waiting on my 2nd fc660c(first one was faulty) and the sound is night and day.Will u be ok though with 65%?Otherwise you can get the normal Realforce 87U 45g or 55g.\nRGB is tacky and the realforce RGB is stupidly expensive for what it is.Also topre boards have dye sub PBT caps so they are perfectly fine
I never said you HAVE to like RGB, just calling it tacky is ignorant and pointless.\n\n\n\nIt's like calling mechanical keyboards tacky because you can get gold keycaps.
2 sliders were loose fitted,had woble and that made a tottal different sound for only those 2 keys.It wasnt sth serious but it is upsetting paying 200$+ and having these kind of faults
Imagine conversation including her name\n\n"I'll drive A'Million home"\n\n"I'm taking care of A'Million"\n\n"A'Million is with me right now"
Rice or ramen noodles is the only way I see this happens. Go to an Asian market, rice should be around $25/25lb (can last you 3-4 months). Chicken is the cheapest meat to get. You can also buy a small bottle of vitamins supplements so you won't be too deprived of nutritions.
You must offend the bejeezus outta her
Do you have a certain number of packs you plan to open? Like 20 100k, 10 15k?
FC660C owner here. IMO the top row feels like 35g, middle rows feel like 50g, and the bottom row feels like 45g.
Check your confirmation email. You'll see 2 items Civ6 $30 and the card $170. Total $200. If you don't see this contact Newegg.
It works fine. I'm using one now. Except you won't be able to use wifi calling and band 12. But I won't complain for a $30 phone

I've been thinking about getting EA access too. I'll only play Fifa and Peggle with gf. However, giving EA reputation, I doubt they'll include Fifa 16 as soon as it get released to the vault. At least they should have a discount for ea access members. So I'm holding back until this Sept to see how things turn out
Can it be just a death wave and you don't have enough graves/crematorium? Check your Cims age distribution. Also, incineration plants generate a lot of pollution, even in the water, so don't put them near your water source.
In my case, the arrow went over my head instead lol
Can you elaborate more on why you need to give your parents this much every month? Do they have jobs? Has their mortgage paid off? IMO 2.4k is a lot of spending for 2 people living together and don't have any income. Yes you should support your family, but not to the point that you are ruining your future. If you're able to save 2.4k/month, you'd be able to afford a 100k condo when you're 28, or a 300k house when you're 35. Instead of this, taking more student loans will be your burden for about 5-10 years, and may as well make your own future family suffer. You also need some savings for unexpected mishaps and maybe you'd not be able to get a job right away after you graduate. Make a list of your parents' expense and give them barely just that. If you're paying for your sibling's' tuition/spending, tell them to get a loan themselves. If you're the only one paying their mortgage, request your parents go transfer the house to you, or just don't pay for it anymore. This way you're still supporting your family within your means and not letting it affect your future. This would not turn out pretty because your family already expects you to take care of everything, but you need to step up. 
Damn. I really want Sansa to turn evil and take revenge. And I thought Jon was going to live longer far into the plot because of his blood relation to Dany. 
I think the same thing. I have a Galaxy S3 with the exact microphone problem when I flashed Android 5.1.1. There was nothing wrong when it was using 4.4
Haha I just finished this quest yesterday, I laughed at that line too. I was disappointed about the sex scene though, it's not as "detailed" as the scenes with Yen or even Keira Metz
Rephrase it as: The rich, with their power, abuses religion to control the poor, while making a pass for themselves.
yes I tried on amazon and bestbuy, you can add a game for free. Not sure about other sites
Go on ebay, search "volume button oneplus 1". Idk how your button fell out but you may need to solder the new one in. I had to solder mine on the galaxy nexus \n\nEdit: I misread your post. You only need to buy the plastic cover. No need for soldering
Same for me. I even feel that the game load slower when more and more progress is made. 
Aside from others' suggestions, look these up:\n\n- Chase ink cash back rewards (for business owner only): 5% on utilities!, 2% on gas\n\n- Sallie Mae Mastercard: 5% on gas and grocery
I mean the mini usb port on the fc660c. There're no USB 2/3 ports. I even bought a L shaped adapter so I don't put force directly on the port many times, but the adapter doesn't fit snugly b/c of the case design...
The deal isn't available anymore, just $50 promo now. Many items are also out of stock.

Check the white plastic pieces that hook the stabilizers. You may put them on the wrong way, try reversing them.
It looks normal to me because most houses are highlighted in blue (service covered). If you just put down landfills recently, You'll need to wait a bit for the trucks to visit every houses.
I'm on xbox. The game always lags during heavy weather effects (rain/storm). Especially on horse race quests, I can't race properly because of the stutter and Roach keeps stopping

You can try healthcare related products. Ie: vitamins, glucosamine, fish oil, salonpas, analgesic. If her dad smoke, buy a good lighter. But ask your gf if her parents would like it first
that's what I think the deal is on MS Store. Now that I read the link again, http://majornelson.com/2015/06/19/buy-xbox-one-choose-a-game-for-free/?linkId=15007432. It said "See your local retailers for details", which make senses that this deal is only for retailers.

Newer FC660C has the top row at 35g weight. Many people have observed this. I bought mine in October, and I even feel my top row @ ~35g, bottom row @ ~45g, while middle rows are around 50-55g. And the USB port is known to fail if you plug/unplug a lot. I'd still suggest you go for FC660c if you can afford it.
we keep passing the ball back, and when we have a chance to shoot we lose the ball after 21533250354 touches
If your fingers hurt with browns, you probably won't like 45g topre. The topre resistant weight is at the very top of the keypress, so you'll feel a little more resistant pressing down the key. You can try Gateron Clear/White switches (35g) and Topre 35g. They're hard to find though.

Thanks I didn't know that about vitamins. It's definitely doable with $50. I was doing $50/mo in a year during college. With an additional $20 you can get more protein, fiber and vitamins\n\n
Check the history of your phone calls, texts, voicemails, emails, skype, chat, etc. If he's really your bf, there must be some ways you two communicate with each other while he's away. I'm in a long distance relationship, and I'm not a picture person either. I only have 1 picture of us together, but we have tons of phone calls and texts. Also, try to find out what's his previous job was and why he kept going away on business trips, and where he went to see if they make any sense.
The colors are amazing. What LUT do you use?
Loving the long profile caps. Where did you get them?
No you get a free game on any xbox one console you buy. It is to hook new customers, or 360 users. Of course if you already had one it's unnecessary lol
I'm wondering if the stomach will get used to digest soft foods. For example: you drink soylent for a month, then eat something heavy like pizza/burger, do you have problems digesting them at all?
Where did you sit at the final exam yesterday? I couldn't find you.
I'm pretty lazy myself so I try to keep things neat at minimum effort:\n\n- Clothes: buy a shitload of hangers if you're lazy to fold them.\n\n- Cook: try to limit your dishes usage. Ie: I usually cook with 1 pot and eat with 1 bowl. I wash that only bowl right after eating, or wash it when I have my next meal\n\n- Have a small bin in every room. Probably next to your couch if you sit there a lot\n\n- Clean up a little after you do something. That way you don't have a big mess by the end of the week. <-- tbh I don't do this often but that's what my mom keep nagging every time she visits lol

"WE WERE ON A BREAK!"\n\nSeriously though, you shouldn't have told her about it. It meant nothing, but you'd  be mad too if she slept with someone else, right? I'm sorry to say this but no matter what you do, it's up to her to forgive and trust you again.
Criticism. It's good to be polite but sometimes we're just being too supportive. Ie: if my best friend is getting fat, I'd say "Dude I think you should lose some weight" etc. Not that I hate or try to intimidate him, but I actually care about his health.
Same for me

The problem is not about taking away their freedom of speech at all. Yes you can say whatever you want, but why abuse your rights to harass other people. They can't take a little discipline which directly resulted from their  harassment on other users. I imagine it like when their parents take away their toys because they were bad, then they roll all over the floor screaming.
I use notebooks as a rest. 1 notebook for low and 2 for high profile. They extend the support to your arm and not just your wrist. Cheap solution and also made of wood :P

Try reinstall in windows 10. Maybe win7 isn't compatible with your Skylake parts
I have the same problem. My xbox isn't even shipped yet, but they said they couldn't cancel my order b/c "the preparation is already sent to the warehouse", and told me to refuse the package when it gets to my door.... I'm sure they can cancel it but their customer service reps don't care enough to go an extra mile to help out customers
The 100+ pcs from zeal website are cheaper too

Sexy TKL keyboard and number pad you got there. What brand are those?
Congrats! I hope now you can move out and try living in your own, escape your parents' control. Sadly our parents always expect us to be good and successful like it's a normal thing, that's why they aren't happy when we achieve something. 
Providers need to upgrade their infrastructure and mobile plans for this to happen. We can easily go over data limit just by one misclick -> fuck whole movie is downloaded. But currently we're not even using LTE at its full capacity. It'd be like using $2k gaming PC to play Candy Crush
It's a known issue on the FC660C (not on fc660m). The usb connetor is soldered directly on the circuit board. Every time you plug/unplug the cable, you're adding force to the solder point and it gets loose over time. Google "fc660c usb port" to see more posts about this. You can dispute the transaction. Or ask someone to solder the usb port back.

Looking at your list, I'm guessing you don't cook much? You can buy things in bulk/bigger size, especially snacks, condiment, breakfast bars, bread. You should also try looking for coupons, or a cheaper store. Other that that, I think your list are healthy, and I wouldn't take stuff out to save money, but make your health worse

yeah that'd work too. I had it before using "81 tiles"
If they throw the food out straight away they feel guilty for wasting it because "40 years ago we don't even have food to eat". But when it rots, it's more reasonable
Reading your past posts, I think your mom just pretends to disappear and spreads the news to worry you. Can you ask a friend to call your home, pretending to be a bank or something and ask your mom on the phone to check ? Ie: "Hello I'm Amy from BoA customer service dept, can I speak to Ms. Mom plz?" If you mom answers, just ask random survey questions about customer satisfaction then hang up.\n\nOr, I think you should just stop talking to her. If you miss your siblings, contact them. Don't talk to your mom. If your sister mentions her, make no comments, change the subject, or say "I don't want to talk about her".\n\nI also googled some info to see if you can have a one-sided divorce. I found this: http://info.legalzoom.com/onesided-divorces-nyc-25158.html. Also, make a post on /r/legaladvice to see if they can help you about this matter
I had this problem. If you don't want to redesign your rail network, you can use "81 tiles" and "Unlimited outside connection" mod to add additional connection tracks parallel to the one leading outside the city. Eg: I built an extra outside connection rail right next to the congested rail. And split my East bound trains to Rail #1, West bound trains to Rail #2.

The only way would be to order another Leopold and just exchange the keycaps and sell it cheaper to recoup the loss.Or maybe get a HHKB keycap set and install the alphas only but lettering will be different
Hypersphere himself uses Superlube thin with that type of accessory as shown in the picture.U def need a thin one.Yes that is how u lube the sliders.I can't help u with the last question because I haven't done that myself.I would go for the Fc660c though.It feels more rigid and expensive than hhkb that felt too plasticky to me.I also like plate mounted Topre so there's that too :D
Isn't this the same color as Dsa Wolf Mark?
No not really.Bluetooth isnt popular.The other option is Filco Convertible but no ISO layout.
I got the FC660M and feels pretty sturdy. I got it because i use the delete and arrow cluster too often.Also if u want later u can buy an aluminum case for the fc660m. Leopold has nicer stock caps too
Not anymore i think.There are certainly more issues with Varmilo boards rather than Leopold if u check the sub Reddit so there is that...
You could try these since they are cheaper too if u like their font [Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/108-104-key-PBT-double-color-backlit-keycap-OEM-profile-for-Cherry-MX-switch-Wired-USB/32749155654.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_5_10065_10068_10000074_10000032_119_10060_10062_10056_10055_10000062_10054_10059_10099_10000013_10103_10102_10000016_10096_10000056_10000059_10052_10053_10107_10050_10106_10051_10000097_10000094_10000053_10000007_10000050_10084_10000100_10083_10000047_10080_10082_10081_10110_10111_10112_10113_10114_10115_10037_10000041_10000044_10078_10079_10077_10000038_10073_10000035_10122_10121,searchweb201603_7,afswitch_3,ppcSwitch_5,single_sort_1_default&btsid=15c3bcb9-d574-4240-bab4-ac0a16e4d8d0)

Doesnt really matter.It is like 40%chance for it to have import costs even if he sends it via USPS and commits tax fraud by declaring it as 30 bucks.These days if it somehow says a name or sth they google it so they can tax it properly :/
I have a Novatouch TKL ISO with Varmilo PBT Dyesubs.I live in EU too if u are interested
Is k3 topre stem or mx?
I wouldnt do that.They are lower quality than the originals and quite bad  generally.The only viable way would be to buy a realforce 55G swap the domes between RF and HHKB and try to resell the RF to recoup the cost
I am dissapointed.Where is my old Novatouch? :(
keyboardco.com also
Actually i find the sound of a hypersphered novatouch superior to type S HHKB. If only CM made it with 55g domes.For me the best non Topre made board is the Leopold ones.Feels snappier i believe
get the HHKB set then.I think its like 60$ + shipping from elitekeyboards
Realforce cluster and ESC .Τhe other are Hangul Leopold stock from a white board ;)
On both u would need to change the keycaps soon because they are ABS.But it will be difficult due to being Azerty\n
Kailh Blues not Cherry.Pretty bad.You can get a GANSS or CM Quickfire Rapid with that much money that are miles better
get a variable wait 87U and buy hyperspheres? 220+60$.The only thing u wont pay is import fees
Greece. Ask them to put low price on the packet.for example if it did cost 120$ u would have to pay extra 50 euros for that.But if u say to them to "declare" it as 30$ then u propably will pay nothing
Eh too bad it's on Massdrop . I liked that set but i can't justify paying twice the money asked on taxes and import costs :/
I can get RHA ma450i or ma350 or Soundmagic E10 in my price range.1more isnt available in EU\n\n
https://www.candykeys.com/product/fc210-tp-black-mx-brown\n\nSomething like that?
The removable wire and strong is a big plus propably.But shipping would be extremely slow from aliexpress.Are they known for their quality and qc?I was strongly considering RHA due to 3yr warranty
Try to send a mail on Cynthia, she is the Varmilo rep.She will propably be able to help you.\nzhh19@zhihaihe.cn
I had a novatouch and no the feeling was not the same.In order to make the novatouch better u had to lube the sliders and hypersphere them,essentially spending 60$ thus almost the same cost as a Realforce.Those sliders u got have some thin silencing so thats why it sounds better.30g topre is awfull and not tactitle.Imo if you want to get a proper board get the all 45G Realforce or the Leopold FC980C
that says PUSH MEEEEE sooo bad :D
Get the Leopold .Keep the 70 euros and if u dont like it then u can get a Topre later
High Anxiety(High Society)-Uee,Sung Joon and co are discovering the anxiety and drama of being a young adult :D
Do you know thickness for Japanese ones?
Well we generally dont reccommend those brands here....\nWhy not get a Coolermaster Masterkeys Pro L or Ducky shine 6 right now?
Is there some budget limit?There isnt another stock TKL with ALU case.But you can get a Filco Majestouch 2 and a TEX aftermarket case with like 280$ total cost
**Budget** - 50 euros( i might flex it to 60 but thats the max)\n\n**Source** - Iphone 6S/iPad/PC\n\n**Requirements for Isolation** - Mostly outdoors so i might want Iso\n\n**Will you be using these Headphones in Public?** - Yes\n\n**Preferred Type of Headphone** - IEMs\n\n**Preferred tonal balance**- I would say natural while leaning a bit on bass\n\n**Past headphones** - Roccat Syva it was ok for the price,Apple stock ones were bad\n\n**Preferred Music** - Rap/hip-hop/RnB and a bit of pop\n\n**What would you like to improve on from your set-up** - I am just looking for something sturdy(all my earphones die after a year) with a nice Natural tone while having nice bass
No worries.Sorry if i sound a bit aggressive.Its not ur fault but apple's for not having usb.Anyways good luck and try to get either Cherry or Gaterons switches at least(Tesoro doesnt offer either)
It was ok until they suggested Razer for gaming..I literally cringed at that point.\n
No cheaper options for ALU case then sorry.The cases go for 180$ without the KB usually.\nThere are sturdy TLK with plastic cases though that are like tanks eg KUL ES 87 and Leopold FC750R
I bought them to gift them for the secret santa this year.Good quality for the price and thick enough.They certainly dont feel like crap ;)
You will have to drill the case if you want the stabilized keys to be novatouched.I would also get hyperspheres because the nova sliders sound is awful.\nLeopold Fc660c or hhkb are nice choices.I wouldn't novatouch an Rf honestly.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DQyf2Sa.jpg
ebay always sides with the buyer.Would be easier for someone to scam you.My buddy sold a PS4 there and got scammed by someone claiming it was banned.Ebay just sided with the buyer for no reason and returned the money and the returned ps4 was different serial number and banned
Either disable all leds or send it back.You can't do anything else unfortunately
My new year resolution would be finally fine the resolution to go finish my mandatory army training  for 9months and get a 55g fc660c
65% layout best layout :D
No TN panel is reccomended for color sensitive work and its not gonna work no matter how much u calibrate it.Either dish out and get a high end 144hz AHVA panel (Acer XB271HU or the Asus PG279Q) or get a 2nd IPS panel just for color sensitive work
HHKB keyset is 60$ if u wanna try it
Well it resembles GMK Honeywell too .It depends on how u see it.U could ask for permission to run it as SA or scrap it 
You asked for opinions and u got some.Also they cost the same exactly money.Cant help you more than that.U are free to buy whatever you want but u are overpaying for a bad keyboard.\nGood luck
Definately Topre Type Heaven.It is still the real thing even though it does not have the proper Topre sound
topureh is life
take an updoot
radster 2017 confirmed?
Leopold fc900r with mx browns from candykeys.com or mykeyboard.eu \nBetter build quality,better keycaps than both.Good price too
Downdooting spree...Get an updoot\n
/u/Bramm17 can help i guess
Get an external USB hub .It is not a good idea to have a keyboard with USB hub because they are awful qualitywise.\n\nGet this instead . https://www.amazon.com/Storm-QuickFire-Rapid-Tenkeyless-Mechanical/dp/B0068INSUM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1486917864&sr=8-2&keywords=quickfire+rapid
Well at that pricepoint and not willing to buy from amazon u cant get anything else unfortunately
get the Leopold FC750R from candykeys.com .They are from Germany so u will have it real soon :)
Do you care for RGB? If yes then u could wait but it propably wont be AZERTY.Otherwise this is fine too
I cant see why u included leopold if u want LEDs though. Quality wise they are almost the same with Varmilo and slightly better than Ducky.I dont know this Deck brand though.Do you want PBT caps?If yes pick Leopold/Varmilo.Do you want RGB?Pick Ducky.
Get the Lg or the Aoc ones for 144hz and the cheap one does not really matter as long it is IPS.I trust Dell mostly but u can get the Lg 23Mp68vq too if dells are costly
Sold already buddy sorry
Is the plan to use RGB Kailh switches like mentioned before?
The Rapid new version that so many starters get,now with PBT caps!\nIts nice for 79$.Amazing news for a starter board
Ask them to declare it as 30$.I personally payed nothing for taxes for like 3 orders
Topre\n\nA girl i liked comes to my home to help her in a project.Proceeds to type on my old Nova(rip) and admired that.I felt so proud :)\nGot the W ofc too ^^
Would that look fine on a white board?I am considering it for my fc660m
It does not use Cherry blues.They are Gaote clones.Its ok for the prices but not much
That is a bad way to get on a Topre journey.U know it is not MX blue right?\nIf you want topre this is the only way http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/usa-topre-realforce-104ub-variable-black-on-black-keyboard.asp
Fc660c is being offered by candykeys.com and mykeyboard.eu . No luck for hhkb 
Maybe it was because they muffle 89% of the sound unlike the type S .Might be the lube too. In fact the ideal kb for me would be a 55g FC660C without silencing mod. I think i am weird :D
EU pride...Keep it up buddy!!! Can we expect more projects in the future?(ansi too maybe?)
I am not so sure how I feel about that.
candykeys.com or mykeyboard.eu \nBoth are from EU and ship to Norway as far as i know\n\nI have bought from candykeys without any problem
They never sold them afaik.The ones from taobao are scratchy and the JTK ones are faulty for now.So your only choice is to get a nova from mechmarket or wait
I had to open my novatouch because it had defective domes and replace the ones. Even the thought of doing it again makes me nauseous :D. Also you would have to find domes from 55g Realforce and that would be pricey. Really hope jchan94 finally makes the aftermarket domes .Maybe after the warranty period is over i would try to mod it.Might be time get one and sell my Nova too :)  I dont find the need to change the stock dyesub sets so no need for the stems :D
Leopold FC660C or the M version with hangul\nhttp://www.leopold.co.kr/data/item/1406543159_l3

Yeah, exactly.\n\n\n\nIt's usable but it's just not very good, I really don't see why the fuck it got nerfed into the ground.
Don't forget them randomly being docile, so you think you've got enough time to move and they instatase you with no warning sound.
No, the regular Hakuchou has a higher top speed as it can wheelie, the fastest motorcycle in a straight line is the Bati.
Pay full amount for novatouch board so u can remove the stems.Remove existing stems plus the silencing rings.Install silencing rings in stems.Install them on board.

No ETA for that u could pm BunnyLake  to find out
Yea the only thing u want to consider is if u are gonna change the keycaps or not.I change layouts pretty easily though so dont be afraid to do that :P
I have bought 2 boards from them.Amazing service and fast shipping
We actually won USA with some stars on Mundobasket 2006.That was a hell of an accomplishment tho for the Greek team

Did he cheat on her with that filthy Dell ruberdome?
I would definately buy it instead of all the other boards u listed easily.Amazing quality and nice thick pbt caps.But thats just me and i dont like leds on my keyboards

But it isn't.\n\n\nYou can't just say 'it's easy' because it's ENTIRELY reliant on the pilot, if the pilot has a brain and even a sliver of situational awareness they won't just fly into a rocket.\n\n\n\nMontages are literally just that - montages. They're compilations of gameplay that is usually recorded over at least a month or 2.
Where does the PC player you play with live, and where do the other people that play on console live? that could very well be the issue.\n\n\n\nThat, and get them to send you a speedtest result.
Transferring from what I understand is being completely disabled.
.....Huh.\n\n\n\nI had this exact issue with certain cars (most notably, the E36' gauge cluster looked like ass) and I found out that it was due to my VRAM, no matter the setting world car quality was set on, certain vehicle textures would look like shit.\n\n\n\nI'm assuming you have that setting maxed? you shouldn't have any performance issues as I play with at ultra on a 390.
That'd be great.\n\n\nAfter listening to the same stations for a good ~2K hours, you tend to get just a *little* bored of them.\n\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the abysmal punk station.... like come on, no metal AT ALL? just punk? not to mention the tiny amount of electro we've got.
Yes, but in a game the differences other than the obvious layout difference will be virtually nothing.
How much VRAM do you have?
So I've just realized, the static items like the coat and whatnot are there, but the characters aren't.\n\n\nThey're in their normal locations...
Check your email? or even just go on UPlay and check when it says you last played.
Retarded question but, how on earth do you get the new stuff to show?\n\n\n\nI've updated and went into the safehouse, restarted many times, still nothing.
And the most obnoxiously, ugly, non-fitting rims to match.
Awwwww, it's okay. \n\n\nPlease, don't let me interrupt you being a little bitch over nothing, trying to start an argument you very clearly cannot win and have no understanding of what's actually going on.
Yeah, it's kinda weird, it absolutely ruins some vehicles.
> It's the same job.\n\n\nBut it really isn't. They have the exact same idea yes, but escapes are different and the maps are completely different.\n\n\n\nFair point with cook off and art gallery though, classics heists are debatable because they ARE different heists, no matter if recycled or not.\n\n\n>Until you take in to account the arm and leg all those DLC heists cost\n\n\n\nExcept you can get virtually all of them for less than ~$15 on sale, and even then there's far more vanilla heists than there are in PDTH.\n\n\n\nPDTH while yes, it literally IS replayable, but the amount of times you can play the same 9 heists (assuming you have the DLC), is pretty damn limited unless you're trying to get all achievements for instance, there's simply nowhere near as much variety - and that's the core issue with PDTH and why virtually no one plays it today.
You completely fail to miss that VV has the audacity to run his mouth and act like an entitled baby.
I honestly don't see what the issue is.\n\n\nThey're much cheaper, no shit they're going to be slightly worse for gaming, anyone selling their modern Intel CPU for Ryzen (unless it was an i3 for instance) they're an idiot, when games begin to use >4 cores, this'll be when Ryzen truly pulls ahead, and far ahead it will.\n\n\n\nBy that time realistically Intel should have more chips with >4 cores that aren't retardedly overpriced, if developers hurry up and make their games run on >4 cores, AMD will have a damn large upper hand.
They're absurdly easy to use and much more powerful than the AMCAR/Brenner.\n\n\nI mean fuck, the Bronco + Reinbeck is pure meta, I don't see how you can say "there's no horrible weapon balance issues".
The sale value is 50% of the cost of the upgrades + base vehicle, this doesn't include vehicle paint and a few other things.
If you're asking will you type faster on a mech board, yes, and no.\n\n\nSome people do, some people don't.\n\n\nIt's mainly just feeling, generally if you can already type fast you won't type much faster, if at all.
I swear it was patched a little while ago.
Strange, mine goes back to crew all the time.
It still works?
Quite frankly if the jetpack is ever released in GTA 5, people will go apeshit. Everywhere.
That's usually not how it works.\n\n\nThe way crashing works now is they basically just teleport you and mass spawn something right next to you, which for some reason causes your game to instantly crash, the ol 'spawn planes until your framerate goes to nothing and then you crash' isn't really used anymore from what I've seen.
I just hope the weapons are solid, rather than being copy+paste....\n\n\nIt'd be amazing to have some actually usable weapons, rather than incredibly mediocre weapons that you'll use once and never touch.
Yup, great anticheat isn't it?
TL;DR: You can't buy them pre-sanded, but you CAN do it yourself with any cheap set of ABS keycaps (I mean, you CAN use backlit PBT but I wouldn't particularly advise it).
AWD swapping a P1.\n\n\n w  h  y  
No shit.\n\n\nThey can even force crash your game, I've had numerous encounters of some complete dog shit players that attack on sight, run their mouthes in chat then blatantly toggle, then when people start votekicking+reporting, they force crash you.
It has high zoom, which obviously allows you to peek more distant lines of sight in a sense, it also can partially alleviate the annoying as hell dynamic brightness level, if you zoom in on a window from the outside that's dark as fuck, usually it'll focus on where you're aiming due to the zoom, and thus you can actually see.
TL;DR: You used an insecure password, someone stole your account and the months later when you finally realize, the person whom stole your account resets it again.\n\n\n\nTell me, how is the total BS title relevant at all? you used an insecure password, someone found your password on a database most likely (or you downloaded malware and someone stole your account that way) then changed your email, how exactly is that Rockstar's fault? whilst I agree there SHOULD be 2FA and AT LEAST email verification for changing your password and/or email, but there's a very simple solution; use a fuckin' secure password that isn't absurdly short and keep an eye on your email.
...That's artifacting.\n\n\nEither you've OC'd your GPU and you pushed it too far, or your GPU is dying.\n\n\nSee if this issue persists in other games, if it does and your GPU isn't overclocked.... bad news.
Either he has a shitty connection, or the PC players he's playing with (matter of fact, how can you even tell they're PC players?) coincidentally have bad upload speeds.\n\n\n\nI've not noticed anything with Xbox players (since, I play on PC) and I don't see how it'd go one way but not the other, so I think he has a trash connection.
Yeah, it's quite bad.\n\n\nInitially when buying this game I was so excited to own all cars, but now? I just feel... overwhelmed.\n\n\nI feel like they just have so many cars, to the point VERY few vehicles actually get proper treatment and attention, it's such a shame really.\n\n\n\nMaybe in the next title, with DLC packs we could get a bunch of vanilla vehicles that've been reworked? (ie, fitment fixed, lower quality textures improved etc, minor bugs here and there worked out) so that way we only have x amount of vehicles, but as time goes on there's way more?\n\n\n\nI dunno, just spitballing really.
How the fuck am I a fanboy?\n\n\n\nLiterally, what? did you just feel like getting into a fight so you seen me say 'fanboy' and decided to do the same thing? even then how in the fuck am I a fanboy? according to my flair I don't even own a fucking AMD product, so how does that work? I still have an Intel CPU, I don't have ANY bias towards companies for no reason, so no, I'm not a fanboy.\n\n\n\nI explained to him that it would've been a far better idea to wait and at very least consider Ryzen because being 'brand loyal' for PC hardware benefits no one, at all.\n\n\n\nNot just that, it wasn't a fight at all, I literally just said that he shouldn't be a fanboy (because I mean, if you call yourself an 'intel guy', you ARE a fanboy, this isn't something like vehicles where there's a lot of preference and it's a genuine reason, being an 'intel guy' literally just says you're biased towards Intel products for no good reason) because it pointlessly limits your options and makes you look ignorant.\n\n\n\nBut please, downvote me and call me a fanboy with zero ground what so ever just because I'm giving someone advice.
Firstly, I'd do a couple of jobs and buy a rifle of your choice alongside the marksman rifle, the homing launcher coming last since you should only really need it for missions where helicopters spawn.\n\n\nAfter that I'd buy a decent vehicle, whether it be a motorcycle (much cheaper usually) or a sports/supercar, it's your choice.\n\n\nThen I'd save for an apartment, doesn't matter what apartment but obviously the 205K Del Perro one is the cheapest with a 10 car garage.\n\n\n\nFinally, I'd buy a CEO office followed by a vehicle warehouse. Crates are good, but you really need multiple people to run them for you and those people get paid virtually nothing, whereas running cars is almost entirely solo.\n\n\n\nAfter that I'd buy a Buzzard eventually, but you may want to wait since there's a DLC that will contain "military hardware" and armed vehicles, so there may just be a better option, a Buzzard IS useful but it's IMO not critical unless you're running crates.
Search it on Youtube, it directly relates to the VC easter egg.
Some time in 2014/2013 I seen it on sale and bought it (IIRC, a few days after Big Bank released) alongside a couple of DLCs.
Yup, same thing for me, it doesn't appear to change anything, but random textures DO get changed, the rear window of the Focus RS for instance, becomes really blurry when the setting is set on low.
Step 1: Swap Skyline of your choice to RWD\n\n\n\nStep 2: Imagine that the GT-R badge isn't there\n\n\n\nDone.
Yeah, that's the biggest disappointment for me with Cunning Stunts, they're so goddamn easy.\n\n\nInstead of being actually difficult, they're effectively just normal races with more climbing/descending and jumping.
And yet you COMPLETELY miss all of the additions and improvements PD2, and the whole y'know, actually being replayable.\n\n\n\nAnd "there's no horrible weapon balance issues", you clearly haven't used shotguns in PDTH.
Yeah, FH3's map is cool as fuck (mainly, because I live less than an hour away from the real location haha) but it's really underwhelming in terms of roads.
The M308 is better than both the AMCAR and the Brenner, there's no real downside to it.\n\n\n\nThe Reinbeck is so good because it OHKs to the head and it's incredibly easy to use.
Generally you want both at the same level, unless you feel uncomfortable with them being even.\n\n\nOn one hand you could have vertical a little higher so you can look up and down more easily at low DPI, but even then it'd be super weird having uneven sensitivities. 
Implying all pilots are completely retarded.\n\n\nI mean fuck, a while ago for shits and giggles I had my friend whom is an awful pilot, try to kill me endlessly whilst I freefire rockets at him, in the end I landed a hit after a good ~15 deaths. And no, I'm not just bad at judging travel time either.\n\n\nThe only viable way to down a jet is either RPG them if you're lucky and they're an idiot, or use BST and spray the fuck out of them with either a marksman rifle, heavy sniper or a minigun if theyr'e close enough, even then they can VERY easily bail out prior to exploding.
There's no hard evidence AT ALL.\n\n\nIt's literally just drawings that could very well be Rockstar fucking with us. I mean fuck, even IF it's going to exist at a point, there's absolutely no way it exists right now.
I never said it wasn't, but you can't just say 'get a 7700K' without considering the 1700, it's ENTIRELY dependant on what games the specific person plays, games that use >4 cores will benefit from a 1700 more, where the only real downside is in a very few hand-picked games that run at like 5FPS lower than on a 7700K.\n\n\n\nNot just that,  there's the 1600X coming soon(TM), which assuming IPC is the same if not better, it SHOULD perform just as good as the 1800X in terms of gaming performance, and may just be able to hit higher clocks and thus get more comparable IPC to the 7700K, though that may not be the case - only time will tell.
No number 9's either.
\n>AAA games are getting to a point - or have already arrived at it - where they can make very good use of the hyperthreading an i7 provides \n\nAnd yet you don't recommend an R7 1700 for gaming?\n\n\nWhat? it's similarly priced to an i7 (slightly cheaper IIRC), yet has literally DOUBLE the physical cores and double the threads. Games are beginning to use >4 cores (technically, since threads are shown as cores, theoretically any game that uses >4 cores and at least 1 thread should support >$ cores) and when that is common (which well, it seemingly is) a 1700 will curbstomp a 7700K, even further so considering the price point.\n\n

It was definitely somewhat harder. How? I don't know, but it was in some way.\n\n\n\nPrior DW was difficult solo assuming you weren't abusing the most cheap build, now? I can consistently solo DW with no real issue.
How exactly are you going to not bottom out with such light springs, even further so being linears? it's a good idea, just they really didn't try very well.
You do if you buy the vehicle during the sale period, though I don't know if it's the same for already owned vehicles.
Yeah same, it's all taste really, some vehicles I can't stand exposed hardware on some vehicles/kits whereas others it ties the kit together (quite literally).

Are you looking for a car for racing? freemode?\n\n\nIf freemode, literally just choose whatever you want.\n\n\nRacing? I'd say either the Tempesta, Nero or the RE-7B, or even the Zentorno for that matter, the Nero appears to be the easiest to drive whereas the Zentorno is the cheapest, but the RE-7B demolishes on a tightish track. \n\n\nAs far as top speed, the 900R has the highest top speed by quite a bit, followed by the 811 and the X80 Proto.
....Except crates are less efficient than vehicles, even further so on a smaller scale.\n\n\n\nVehicles are very, very easy profit of 80K/10 minutes (and in-between he can run headhunter for instance for an additional ~30K), crates you have to initially pay for and they take forever to collect, whereas vehicles? you just have to pick them up, then sell them.\n\n\n\nNot just that, you're seemingly forgetting that the cheapest office is 1.5M. I'm pretty sure a new player won't be able to get 1M without buying weapons or a decent vehicle, if they manage to it'll  be complete hell.
...Why do you have a locked chip on an unlocked motherboard?\n\n\nBetter yet, why didn't you wait for Ryzen?
The GPU chart is straight pointlessly linear, and the CPU chart is even more shitty.\n\n\n\nYou don't need an i7 for gaming, as long as it's not for instance a sandy bridge or older i5, it'll suffice just fine (obviously, more modern i5s won't need to OC to keep up) so recommending an i7 instantly is fucking dumb, even more so when the R7 1700 exists.\n\n\n\nWhile, yes, a 7700K WILL perform MARGINALLY better in games that only use 4 cores, but, it makes virtually no difference. Don't believe me? [here's a video of numerous benchmarks with a 7700K@5GHz against a 1700@3.9GHz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXVIPo_qbc4), you'll notice even in titles that BARELY touch the additional cores on the Ryzen chip, performance is always within 5FPS.\n\n\n\nEven then assuming you play games where the performance difference is a consistent 5FPS, the 1700 is $329 on Amazon right now whereas the 7700K is $348, then you have to take the motherboard pricing difference into factor (which given, isn't THAT large but still) and even still, you're putting an 8 core 16 thread CPU against a 4 core 8 thread CPU. Realistically, the R5 line will be cheaper and should have virtually the same gaming performance, for a lot less.
I didn't mean paid, I meant when paid DLCs releases, they could gradually release the total amount of vehicles and actually polish them.

Initially I had a Sabre Turbo as my first car, after doing a few jobs and buying a 2 car garage, the first car I see as I exit my garage was a fuckin' Sultan. I still own both of them to this day.
They use the stabilizers that aren't just a wire I'm 99% sure (They're Cherry, I think, I can't remember)\n\nI don't really see how the lighting would have a purple tint, as they're literally white LEDs. Shit, I have a Masterkeys S RGB and the white is by far the most accurate I've seen.\n\n\nAll in all it's a great board, AFAIK it's the only non-custom board with that layout and a standard bottom row.
Hmm, true...\n\nBut it HAS to be?, they mentioned that the Infernus is from GTA 3...\n\n\nI dunno, I just hope it's not the same, hideous vehicle. Hell, I don't see why anyone in their right mind would want it to return, considering there's vehicles like the GTA VC/SA Cheetah.

It appears like Ryzen only benefits from RAM that is above 2666 if you're running RAM that's clocked below that.\n\n\n\nThe difference between like, 2400 and 2666 is very considerable, whereas if you're running 2666 and go to like 3200, it won't make much of a difference.

Now.\n\n\n\nAside from that, I wouldn't bother with a jet honestly, the only real use is to get from the absolute peak of the map to the bottom fairly quickly, even then a fast heli isn't that much slower.\n\n\nThe Cargobob is...... I dunno. It CAN save you money in repairs, but it's slow as all hell thanks to Rockstar pointlessly nerfing it into the ground at a point, the last time I used a Cargobob it was quite literally slower than driving, the only real benefit is that you might take less damage if you gain enough altitude (but then, if helis spawn you're in a bit of a shit spot).

It IS a Cosworth RS500 though. The headlights and overall front end, the fact it uses a turbo 4 cylinder(?) engine in-game, the spoiler and overall body styling is a dead giveaway.\n\n\nObviously since y'know, GTA, there's parts of other vehicles in it, but it's definitely a good ~80% a Cosworth.

Yeah, I really, REALLY hope there's something to combat it.\n\n\nWhether it be an AA vehicle or something else, or just straight up making jets weaker, I don't care. I'm just fucking sick of trash players whoring jets 24/7.
They're made by 2 different parts of Rockstar, are they not?
>The guy behind the channel reviewed someone's rx7 without properly securing the hood\n\n\nPartially true, what he done was he slammed the hood on the latch, bending it the opposite way, and didn't even bother to check if it had closed.
Yeah it's strange, I seen the guy's reply prior to replying here and I didn't believe it at first, it kinda blows really.\n\n\nI just wish they'd improve the Bati's sound, it's so fucking bad.
Reporting people x amount of times will get you put in the cheater's pool AFAIK.
I just really hope it's not the GTA 3 Infernus, because I'm sure most of us can agree, that car was damn ugly, the front end especially, a Diablo/Countach would be sweet though, hopefully it's a sports classic instead of a sports/supercar.\n\n\n\nAs for the Turismo, it's most likely going to portray the SA Turismo, at least I hope, because an F40/F50 would be fucking great.
> i know the future of GTA online and Gta 5 . i found it on my jailbroken ps3.\n\n\n\n\nRiiiiiiiiiiight, because we all know Rockstar keeps all of their upcoming DLC plans sitting in the PS3 version of the game and no one else has found it 3 years after release.\n\n\nOkay.
Yeah, it's been doable for quite some time now, prior it was pretty rare, but now since some fuckwad released a free trainer that has the crashing option (or someone bought and leaked it), it's fucking abysmal.\n\n\n\nThe fact some people will literally attack on sight then cheat to win, then they have the audacity to run their mouthes baffles me.
I just really hope that A: in the later update we get the Rustler from SA / a similar aircraft, and B: more weapons that are actually useful.\n\n\nFor instance, a few DMRs (ie a MK17, a G3, a VSS Vintorez etc) that basically have superb DPS and excellent range, but they have like 20 round mags at most, some more diverse LMGs (ie something like an M249 that fires much faster but does lower damage, an HK21 that does damage between an assault rifle and the combat MG, has less spread than other LMGs but fires a bit slower and has a smaller mag), there's a fuckload of things they could alter here and there to have a plethora of options.
No?\n\n\nI have 1600MHz DDR3 and an 8GB 390, I get zero performance issues because the game seemingly isn't using my RAM as VRAM (I REALLY doubt it is considering the performance I get).
It's a real vehicle, a company/whatever called ZiL makes it, called the Punisher.
Have you seen the VCS version?
He kinda was though, he wasn't DIRECTLY but it was hugely implied he was speaking as if Rob is below him.\n\n
How is that ground? I didn't "attack" anyone, matter of fact how does that even make me a fucking fanboy? I own an Nvidia card and am using an Intel CPU. Shit, to think you act like this and you call others "a small child"? that's hilarious.\n\n\n\nYou're one special snowflake.
>Give it fast RAM, since it treats RAM like vRAM\n\n\nI'm 99% sure that only happens IF your VRAM is maxed.
Yeah, old DW is 100% superior, old DW was harder and didn't require absurdly high damage to well, do good damage.\n\n\n\nThough, medics are great, solid enemy that adds genuine difficulty without being cheesy.
Yes, ABS keycaps feel more "hollow" while PBT keycaps feel more "solid."   While it's not like doubleshot ABS caps flex more than PBT (they really don't), it's like ABS doubleshots feel more "Flimsy" if that makes sense.  And it's not from being thinner.\n\nThat being said, ABS is MUCH easier to machine into nice designs than PBT is.  there is no PBT keycap set that matches how the white ducky "YOTG" doubleshot keycap set looks like, with its evenly diffused backlight bleed to make the keycaps look like they're glowing.  The Bossi (Kananic brand) PBT doubleshot sets come very close, but you can see artifacts and blemishes on those caps that you won't on the ducky YOTG white set.
Ducky shine 6 with blues.
It's just a new spacebar.  They've done that before.  It just wasn't a "year of the xxx" spacebar but rather other stuff like Cities, etc.  But now that they have another shine 6 coming out they designed a rooster spacebar.  They have other shine 6's including China exclusives also (like that red one with white coated/dyesub (?) keycaps and transparent tops with printed legends).
If you're talking about the original keycap set that was used first by Ducky on the Year of the Goat, and then on the One TKL RGB (white), it's this one, but it's been out of stock for ages.\n\nhttps://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1579\n\nI suggest you call them on the phone and ask if they will ever get more stock.\n\nIt's still available in Taiwan (not surprising since Ducky is a Taiwanese company): \nhttp://www.b18.com.tw/Shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=955\n\nyou can use a proxy like "Shopping Mall Japan" to buy it.\n\nVortex makes a white PBT set that is a nice set, using the exact same fonts as on the Ducky caps, but isn't as beautiful with the backlight bleed (looks flawless with the LEDs off of course) or as evenly lit as the Ducky white ABS doubleshots.  Some of the keys outside of the main key cluster, to the right (keys not on 60% keyboards) have a strange square imprint that is invisible in normal daylight or with the LED's off, but can be seen through the bleed through the keys.  \nThey are bright and vibrant, just like the original Ducky ABS set, with excellent legends, but the backlight bleed isn't as nice.\n\nhttps://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1330\n\nThe black versions don't have this issue as there is no bleed at all, but considerably less light gets through the legends.  The original Ducky sets have a very smooth bleed gradient that makes the keycaps look like they're glowing at night.  But they are ABS, not PBT.\n\nThe doubleshot PBT set that looks the most like the original ducky set, with decent fonts, but with a slightly worse bleed pattern than the Ducky ABS sets, but still better than the PBT caps, are the Bossi white sets (made by Kananic of China).  There may be others but these looks most like the bleed of the original ducky ABS caps.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IBM92GQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n
Same white set as the "Bossi" sets on Amazon.  They are made by Kananic in China.  They apparently have an updated set that has legends that look much more like dyesub type printing with the backlight LED's off, while being fully transparent and letting lots of light through with the LEDs on.  Pretty interesting.  Makes the keycaps look surprisingly good with the backlight off.  Unfortunately you have no way to know if you're getting the new set or the older set (with the normal translucent legends).
nvm, shine 5 is one PCB.
Probably in a month.  Why don't you just buy the YOTM?  The bottom of the case is black anyway.
How do you OPEN the case?  It's stuck in the top corners right by the two feet (the two edges of the ridged heatsink like front).  You said it was easy.  It isn't.  
LMAO!!!!!!!!
I don't have any TKL boards, but I do have the Shine 5, shine 6 and iKBC F108, and the "full size" white RGB version of the One, called the YOTG..  The Shine 6 and Ducky One and Shine 5 all use the exact same RGB LEDs--3528 SMD's, and they are all close to the same maximum brightness.  The shine 5 is very slightly brighter than the iKBC F108, and the SMD's on the shine 5 are a tiny bit slightly larger than the iKBC's.  It's not a night and day difference, however.  This is with the keycaps removed on both.  For all intents and purposes, you can say they are the same maximum brightness.\n\nKeep in mind however that the iKBC only has 7 brightness levels for each RGB channel that can be set: Off, and 1-6, while Ducky has 9 (off, and 1-8) by tapping the FN + color key.  Also the iKBC does not allow you to access "inbetween" levels by cycling the full range linearly, while the Ducky does allow you to access the full range (by holding down Fn and F5, F6 or F7, for more than 1 second), and in CM programming mode, holding down caps lock instead (the caps lock functionality for cycling linearly is currently bugged in the Shine 6 at the moment, but it works still with basic mode with FN+Color key).\n\nAlso while the iKBC has a nicer color wave effect, the other color animations are considerably worse than the shine 5, with the color channels 'stepping out' suddenly and cutting off prematurely, which is blatantly obvious in raindrop and reactive mode.  The Shine 6 has processed color fade in Reactive mode, while in Raindrop mode, both the shine 5/One and 6 will drop an "uneven" color channel early, but it will still fade out evenly, unlike the iKBC.
Is there a USB 2 or lower power mode when you hold a button combination or when plugging in the keyboard?
How are you making the rainbow effect go BACKWARDS?\nIt can only go forwards to the right -->\n\nGoing to the left isn't possible.  It didn't do that even on original firmware.\nThe shine 6 can do it with software.\n\nAnd the only 'undocumented' brightness is getting PWM steps by holding down instead of pressing F5-F7.  Also works for CM modes with Caps lock F5-F7.  You don't have to press it 6 times then hold it down.  You can just hold it down right away.\n\nStill doesn't explain how you made the color effects go BACKWARDS though.  I even saw someone's YOTG with the color wave going backwards and I had every beta firmware ducky released (before 1.06).
Those are not RGB keyboards.   
I JUST DID MY FIRST SOLDERING JOB!!\n\nI switched two of the switches on my YOTM (F to volume up and volume up to F) because I didn't like how weak and non bumpy the F key was.  Was not easy at first but once I learned how to use the desoldering pump correctly it was easy.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3vwMKDt.jpg\n\nI used this kit.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E1ISGH0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nI have a decent desoldering pump coming tomorrow that cost $250, I hope was worth it :/\nhowever I didn't have to use it because the vacuum pump in the kit worked.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWM69C4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I couldn't even afford it.  I just decided an investment like that will pay off in saving a PCB.  Plus it's so easy to swap switches (I still don't have that item yet, as I used the kit's vacuum pump.  This guy used an Aoyue 8800 and had great results but it doesn't seem as easy to use as the Hakkos.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Aoyue-Contained-Desoldering-Internal-Carrying/dp/B00PGFAJWS\n\nhttp://www.overclock.net/t/1611332/blackwidow-x-chroma-stealth-diy
Put that in the software in the RGB values.  it isn't hard to do.
Not only did ripster55 already post that, that's NOT the final version of the year of the rooster anyway.  Only the spacebar is finalized.  That's just a white shine 6 at the moment.  Remember the YOTM has an aluminum faceplate (and metal screws for grounding).  And remember the prototypes of the Year of the Goat?  The final was completely different from the prototype.
The Cherry browns on my YOTG are extremely smooth AND feel VERY nice.  So this doesn't apply for ALL Switch batches.  My favorite browns I used were on my YOTG (that I am using right now) and on the old Logitech G710+ first run, which had browns even more tactile than the YOTG.  My YOTG ones however are perfect.  Enough tactile feedback to give you extra feedback when you press a key fast, noticeable bump if you press it slowly, and not scratchy at all.\n\nThe Outemu brown sample I tested was NOT noticeably better in any way than what I had on my G710+ and the tactility increase was not noticeable enough for me to want to ditch my YOTG.  And I prefer the ones on my YOTG more than anything else because it feels VERY noticeably dampened and much quieter than you would ever expect (I'm still extremely surprised how the RGB Brown housing is naturally silenced!).
There's no such thing as an Acker USB cable.\n\nMy Anker fits the ducky perfectly.  You just cant use the routing system, but it fits for sure.\n\nThis is the one I have in my YOTG, which uses the One case.
Did you try removing the keycap and see if the switch still moves freely with your hand?
As many other intelligent people here said, EVERYTHING is considered 'Troll', 'reportable', 'toxic', and BANNABLE until a LCS player does it in a stream or a tournament and WINS LANE with it.  Then suddenly it's allowed and META, because if Riot dared take action against the LCS player, they would lose all of their sponsors like a hot potato.  Intel, Asus, Zowie, Logitech, Steelseries, Razer....they would jump ship immediately.
identical to the link on amazon.  The 10 foot white one\nYou know you can force it into the 'notch' in the ducky one, right?.
The Ducky One is the refinement of the Shine 3.  The case and cable management system was improved.  And a better micro USB cable than the mini USB on the shine 3.
As I clearly said in my last post, I do NOT own a ducky one.\nI heard about someone complaining about USB2 and USB3 mode not changing the brightness, and being identical, as if the keyboard were stuck in USB2 mode somehow.   USB3 mode should be 30-40% brighter than USB2 mode.  The keyboards are supposed to ship in USB3 mode by default, but the shine 6's were incorrectly shipping with USB2 mode enabled, which many people didn't know about, but USB3 mode still worked.  Right Alt+spacebar while plugging in is supposed to switch to USB3 mode.  If this is an issue, and is non functional, please contact ducky, as there may be a bug in the firmware.  I can't verify this.
Excellent keyboard for those who don't like the shine 6's sink/fin type design.  And unlike the YOTG, you can actually buy one.  Almost all of the YOTG's were preorders, with there being an almost nonexistent window for regular purchase of one.  A big part of this problem was due to the Shine 5 not being available outside of Taiwan for over a month after the YOTG preorders went out.\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard in person, feeling a lot like a fancy Ducky Legend.  And unlike the Shine 6 front case, the YOTM is brainless to open and get to the switches if you want to mod.  Just 6 screws attach the aluminum front plate to the base, and no latches at all, while the Shine 6, while it uses the exact same base, has 8 screws (two are hidden under the small circle feet) and latches all around.  If you want to mod or solder in new switches, you want a YOTM.
I have a ducky YOTG.  It doesn't get any more dirty than a black keyboard does.  The keycaps wont get diry unless your hands are dirty.  just clean them once a month.  it isn't hard.  Throw them into dishwater, let them soak, wipe them with a towel then let them dry for a few hours (the stem is the problem).  Just have another keyboard to use in the meantime or go to work or school when its drying.
You absolutely NEED a multimeter.  A Fluke is the best investment you can ever have, with the second best one being a soldering iron and a decent desoldering pump.  But you would need EE experience to know what is broken and how to fix it, if you could even find the part.
Typical random Chinese bad translation name keyboard.\nIt's probably called something else in China then someone translated it into English. You can tell by that "Legendary" Chinese gamer font on it.
Probably wouldn't have an issue.
That's because of the "Seamless" keycaps that were used.  Doubleshot keycaps require seams in any legend that is encircled, so when a legend is seamless in the front, the seam has to be cut out in the back.  For some reason, on black keycaps, a black rectangle is the seam, and it blocks light.  I haven't seen this issue happen on WHITE seamless keycaps; I replaced my YOTM set with a white doubleshot seamless keycap set I bought from a China shop (the box is labeled cmany or kmany88.com or something; it's at the link below), and the white keycaps have a cutout in the back also, but it doesn't block light.\n\nIt's best to replace the black seamless keycap set with the Vortex 126 key doubleshot PBT set (the new Vortex sets); the white version of those 126 key sets is out stock on MK.com.\n\nif you want a white set, you could try this set:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IBM92GQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nor\nhttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/IKBC104-Double-shot-Translucidus-Backlit-PBT-Mechanical-Keycap-For-Cherry-Keycool-NOPPOO-PLU-HPE-Ducky-Filco/32521595756.html \n(seamless, but font looks more gamery, I have this one on my YOTM and it works well).\n\nor you can try what I don't have:  https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/108-104-key-PBT-double-color-backlit-keycap-OEM-profile-Standard-FILCO-font-for-Cherry-MX/2386080_32748117163.html
It's not precisely the clear housing.  It's Cherry being too busy to upgrade their machines.  There were issues with blues even before RGB versions came out, but when the housing materials got changed, things went to hell for awhile.\n\nThings are much better now; try a shine 6 or YOTM with blues and you will get much better quality.  Ducky is binning them also.
No, Cherry only makes switches with the transparent base and the top flat plastic housing that let's the SMD light shine through.  The RGB LED's are part of the *PCB* directly, and unlike Razer switches or older bulb switches, do not make any physical contact with the switch whatsoever.  In fact, on Ducky and Pok3r boards, the RGB SMD's are on a separate PCB below the switch PCB.
my camera isn't capable of taking good pictures. and then people complain how blurry stuff is after asking me for a photo.  im not rich.  everyone else seems to have super expensive multiple keyboard sets, rare, expensive keycaps and old keyboards and high end cameras, super nice homes and battlestations while I'm next to homeless.  anyway here's a picture.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hCeGHwz.jpg
Yes.
You don't even upgrade your trinket.  And ezreal is weak right now.  You would be doing better just instalocking Caitlyn every game.
All of the spacebars with the fancy designs are NOT Doubleshot ABS, but traditional laser engraved ABS. That includes the shine 2, shine 3, shine 4/5, etc.\n\nYou can't make a spacebar doubleshot with that type of complicated design. It's FAR too difficult.\n
Contact Ducky for an update.  One doesn't exist yet.
You're asking for a lot there.  Probably not going to find anything except another one.\n\nIf you limit some of the "I want my cake and eat it too", you can try a ducky shine 6.  But the backplate is recessed like most standard keyboards, but you can set the backlight white (or any color) and you can program your own media key macros (the presets are calculator, volume up, down, mute, but you can program the entire number pad as media keys with Ducky Macro).\n\nIf you want one of those top plate mounted keyboards like a corsair, well, either buy a Corsair, or try one of those Chinese Outemu/Gateron clone keyboards or hot swappable keyboards like the Vod Ray /teamwolf, Z-77 (not hotswappable), Z-88, etc, and buy a pack of 120 Gateron blues or greens or browns and remove the Outemu switches and put in Gaterons.  I do have a full size teamwolf RGB keyboard, and it does have a (Crappy) wrist rest, top plate switches (like a corsair), but virtually no macro capability or other stuff you want.  \n\nYou're going to have to make compromises.  Or just buy a Shine 6.
very scratchy, inconsistent blues.
6 of course.  The color effects are improved and the reactive mode RGB fades and keeps the same color throughout.  But I like my YOTM the best but its the same firmware as the shine 6.  I have a shine 6 and YOTM. both in MX blues.
Just got to d5 after feeding my butt off by taking teleport top on karthus vs a sion and winning anyway.  Anyway, games are usually decided by how toxic or nontoxic the jungler is.  If you're jungler is spending more time flaming than playing you are not going to win.  Nocturne and Anivia both had hard games but stepped up while our zilean support kept flaming until Nocturne stole baron (After I suicide into the pit to interrupt).
Call them on the phone.  Only they can fix the issue.  They have YOTM's in stock.  I suggest you call them on Monday.
I have two iKBC F108's with MX RGB blues (One has a broken cord, so Amazon sent me another and told me to just keep the first) and they both have very scratchy blues.  Nothing at all like how good my Shine 6 and YOTM blues feel.  So I really don't know.  But I am definitely not happy with the blues on the iKBC.\n\n\nThe RGB MX browns on my YOTG are basically perfect.  Not scratchy at all, fully consistent and feel wonderful, and feel even better with PBT keycaps.
Yes you can do that with Ducky Macro, in profiles 2-6.  "Play/pause" and "Left mouse click" (don't know why anyone would bind that to a key) seem to overwrite or not work together in the same profile however.
file it down?  
The plain one is supposed to be preinstalled.\nThe monkey spacebar is the one that is usually in the same bag as the keycap puller or next to the USB Cable.
I found out the problem.  There are two screws beneath two tiny circle shaped feet :/\n\nThe YOTM has these screwholes there but they aren't used in the YOTM, because the aluminum faceplate only uses the 6 primary screws to attach to the plastic frame and metal backplate.
Make sure CM1 and CM2 are not on.  Press FN+F11 or FN+F12 a few times.
You need one of these, bro.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWM69C4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nJust used one to swap a switch in my YOTM with RGB Blues (I wanted my F key to be super tactile and clicky so I took off the numpad * key and swapped it).
Happens with all of Ducky's keyboards.  There's no fix.  Just unplug it.
Yeah I get you.  $250+ is very expensive to try a switch that you never used before, especially with a switch tester that won't give you the feel of how a topre switch feels like on the RGB version.  If you have money to burn, go for it.  If you have money to waste.
The shine 6's on MK.com are purple, not blue, but are on the blue side of the purple spectrum.  The shine 6's shown on the ducky main website are a much hotter blue.  You could say the MK shine 6's are "Dark blue" but they are truly purple.  I know what purple looks like.  Direct light on it makes it look more like dark blue.  Light reflections on a tilt make it look very purple.\n\nThe 'yellow' outline is not yellow, but gold.  It looks better in person than in pictures.
Nice work.
The LED brightness is completely fine.\nFirst of all, that picture in that other thread is completely ridiculous.\nThe user who took the picture with the paper isn't even using the Ducky in the same mode as the iMac picture.  You can clearly see in the imac picture that the Ducky seems to be in color palette selection mode.  While on that picture with the paper in the back, it's clearly in a custom mode with the bright white in the bottom area keys, a bright red on esc, and dim blue and green at the top.  That's almost like an intentional troll picture or something.\n\nColor brightness in RGB modes isn't handled by 'brightness', as the colors themselves are based on values of 0-255.  0 being off and 255 being maximum.  That's how RGB brightness is handled.  Then to set colors, you set each channel a certain color level.  It's easy to see with the Shine 6's software how it works.  You have far more limited control with the Shine 5 and One, as you have to press keycaps to change the color brightness (levels), and you can also alternate to a linear mode where it can cycle from off to maximum by holding down FN (Or caps lock)+ Color function key, and then releasing to get the level you want.\n\nAnyway, if you remove the keycaps, you will see that the LED's are blindingly bright.\n\nAlso some Ducky keyboards ship in USB 2 mode for some reason (the Shine 6s do); USB2 power mode has about 30% dimmer brightness than USB3 mode.  The modes are in the manual and how to switch when plugging in.
Something completely useless.  But some games might be able to spam apm abilities faster with it enabled, even though it's completely utterly CHEATING.\n\nIt basically acts like pressing and releasing a key SUPER EXTREMELY fast (like 50 times a second or something).
The shine 6 is actually purple, not blue.  The hot blue one isn't being sold here.\nWhat about the YOTM?  It has a black base and an aluminum front plate.\n\nhttps://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2029
Browns are not grainy unless you get a horrible batch of them.  The browns on my Ducky YOTG feel excellent.  Smooth, and feel like less tactile, light clears.
Nice set.
Most of the Year of the XXX spacebars are like that.\nThey aren't doubleshot, so due to that length, it's hard to get them perfect.  You may find some doubleshot PBT spacebars to be slightly warped in the opposite way (edges very slightly downward, which does look better).                                                                    
How are you supposed to find these people?  90% of the time your team just wants to either win by a score of 50-5 (NOT Joking), get 3 infernos and elder and win, or flame the person farthest away from a lost teamfight, or harass the person who played poorly.  I'm referring to games in plat/low diamond here.\n80% of the matches are not fun at all.
Another issue is that it's virtually IMPOSSIBLE to be real life or even decent "internet" friends or pen pals with ANY professional player, even if you feel for them or have feelings (friendship or more) for one of them.   Unless you're in the know, you have literally no way of communicating or reaching out to anyone.  If you aren't challenger tier, and less than 0.1% of players in the world are challenger, there's nothing you can do.  You just have to sit back and post likes or something on reddit or some whatever social media.\n\nI have Mickey on my friend list on Skype and facebook.  Yet he NEVER replies to any messages.  He did "Like" my post where I wrote on his wall after the loss at IEM, but I wish I could --talk-- to him as a friend.  And I can't...and it hurts.
My Vod Ray teamwolf CIY keyboard works fine.  But I already removed the Outemu blue switches and put in Gateron greens.
That isn't the problem.  The YOTG set had excellent bleed that made the entire keycap glow but that was a white non-seamless set also.  The YOTM set is seamless and has black rectangles behind the keycaps that take the place of the "seams" that are required, and that blocks part of the LED light.
You mean like the Ducky Fire 69 edition?  Of course.
The Ducky One is an evolution of the Shine 3 design.  Some are TKL, some full size.  Some are RGB, some are single LED, some are non backlit.  The cable system is massively improved over the Shine 3.\n\nThe Shine series is the flagship version, although it is a bit illogical for Ducky to separate the One and Shine versions.  They should have called the "One" the single color backlit and non backlit versions and the Shine the RGB Versions.  The One single color actually has the PCB traces for SMD RGB LED's, as the YOTG uses this PCB.  It's actually very similar to the Shine 5 PCB, with the double PCB system for the LED's and switches, but cannot use the Shine 5 firmware due to the One housing; Caps lock, scroll and numlock use dedicated RGB SMD LED's instead of using the LED's on the switches.\n
All of the ones listed are better than the shine 5's default ones.\n(assuming you can handle the fonts).\n\nThe only questionable set is the white Vortex 126 key set (the black 126 key set, that I didn't link is flawless however, but again it's black), because of those strange square type markings seen through the bleed on the extended keycaps. 
Shine 6 over the iKBC.  People have been complaining about getting scratchy blues on the iKBC F108/F87.  Someone even had scratchy browns on one of them.
Macro mode does not work in profile #1 (default).
The iKBC's RGB color effects are MUCH worse than the YOTM, even with the buggy firmware update that makes the slowest animation speed laggy on the YOTM.  Also the iKBC has been known for very scratchy MX blue switches (I'm typing on one right now).  The iKBC's stock keycaps are VERY excellent, though, while the YOTM's stock keycaps need to be replaced.\n\nSo, ducky if you want better quality lighting (and a MUCH, MUCH better RGB Reactive and raindrop mode).  iKBC if you want a better case (limited edition only) and better keycaps.
it's in the manual.
Not true at all.
The Shine 6 also has onboard keyboard programming, the exact same as the Shine 5.  Just the option to select 16.8 million colors in CM1/CM2 mode is currently bugged in customization mode but works in full backlight mode (Holding down F5-F7 for more than 2 seconds).   You just also have software to control things better (including the 16.8 million color mode).\n\nThe Glorious Gaming non RGB version was already pretty well liked.  Most likely it will be solid.  The only question is how good the RGB features will be.  I'd say, unless you're extremely tight for cash, why not try the Glorious Gaming version?

Caps are great. the fonts are not.
That LED controls status if win-key lock is on.  Other colors are for repeat rate or delay or something.\n\nFN+Tilde turns the LED off.
Ducky shine 6.
Yes there is.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ8kF-7BAMY\n\nhttps://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2247
I don't have windows 10, so, not me.\nYou're on your own here.\n
The Ducky has media keys also.\njust fyi.\nThe four basic keys (volume up, down, mute and calculator---yes...calculator is VERY useful) are the four extended keys, and then you can map the other media controls with Ducky Macro..  If you don't like using the number keypad, you can map all the media keys you want directly to there without having to press Fn to activate a layer.
The reason to get WHITE backlit keycaps is to let the SHINE come through the legends.  white keycaps tend, due to a different translucent layer, let a lot more light through the legends than most black keycaps.  This isn't a universal rule, but it usually applies.  The new Black 126 key Vortex keycap set (and the black iKBC set used on the iKBC boards) let a lot less light through the keycaps than the white Vortex set does.  Also, some white sets have a very lovely diffused bleed that make the entire keycap glow in the dark.  This was first seen on the Year of the Goat with Ducky's doubleshot white ABS keycaps.   While they are out of stock now in USA ( https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1579 ), you can still buy them in Taiwan and use a proxy (like shopping mall japan) to ship them to USA.  ( http://www.b18.com.tw/Shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=955 ).\n\nThese doubleshot PBT keycaps are just as bright: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/IKBC104-Double-shot-Translucidus-Backlit-PBT-Mechanical-Keycap-For-Cherry-Keycool-NOPPOO-PLU-HPE-Ducky-Filco/32521595756.html , while having a lot less backlight bleed.  The font is a bit too much Super Chinese Gamer font, although slightly better than the E-Element and Vod Ray/Zhuque boards, but the legends let a lot of light through the keycaps, with very little backlight bleed.\n\nI haven't tried these keycaps ( https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/108-104-key-PBT-double-color-backlit-keycap-OEM-profile-Standard-FILCO-font-for-Cherry-MX/2386080_32748117163.html ) but someone said they let a lot of light through also.\n\nThe Bossi sets are the only doubleshot PBT keycap sets that have a very similar diffused backlight bleed to the Ducky YOTG ABS sets (They are made by Kananic of China).  Unfortunately I had problems getting a good set intact; the first one had a broken M key, and when they finally sent a M key (I ASKED for a whole new set just in case something happened), the M key they sent was from an updated set (a different way of doing the legends while still just as bright) but looked very out of place if the backlight was off.   If you want to test your luck: ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IBM92GQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ).\n\nThe new white Vortex 126 keyset also lets a lot of light through the legends, but the backlight bleed is much worse than the famous YOTG set, and there are some issues with square patterns on some of the keys right of the main key cluster.   https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1330  ; its out of stock and I would wait to see if those square patterns issue is resolved or not (it seems to be identical on which key it's on on each set.  It drove me crazy seeing it on Numlock and scroll lock :/
Don't get the Vortex POM.  That's the old set with the non top aligned legends.  Get the new "126" key doubleshot set on MK.com.
QA issues with consistency with getting decent RGB blues, so Corsair only did limited runs of them in the Strafe and Lux.  Having to test too many switches and throw out too many bad ones to be able to make any large run of RGB blue keyboard batches.  Ducky had problems with Cherry's 20 year old machines too.  Ducky told me that Cherry has improved their quality in the last few months, and I've had very few problems with the blues on my Shine 6 and my YOTM, far better than the scratchy blues on the iKBC F108 (had a weak F switch on my YOTM so I desoldered and swapped one from the number keypad).
It's literally impossible for dust to enter switches to begin with.
My YOTG is as easy to keep clean as any other keyboard.  Just don't eat when using it.
You don't have software to select RGB values directly, so you have to do the undocumented feature of holding down FN+ the color key (F5, F6 or F7) or Caps lock + color key (in CM mode for per key customization) to unlock full range linear cycling (a feature carried over from the Shine 4, also undocumented).  I believe it PWM cycles in 5 steps at once out of a total of 256 (meaning the first step goes from 0 to 5, second 6-10, third 11-15, up to 255, and you have to guess when to release the key, so then you can get around 51-64 level shades of RGB instead of just tapping and releasing (which only gives you 8 only).  This also works in the shine 6 but it's bugged in CM mode and doesn't work (so just use the software in that case), but not in full backlight mode (FN+color key hold down+cycle).
Mickey was really unhappy on facebook :(.  We all had to go calm him down. :(
https://www.reddit.com/r/Corsair/comments/3qmovs/question_k70_rgb_multimedia_keys_for_spotify/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+hijacking+media+keys&oq=chrome+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i65l3j69i60.919j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8
As you can see, ALL keys that have encircled legends have this issue.  It's because they are seamless, instead of seamed.  there has to be a physical connection in the layer in the "inner" part and the "outer" part of encircled legends.  That's why regular doubleshot keycaps have "seams" (or breaks) in encircled legends.  It's impossible to make a seamless DOUBLESHOT keycaps without having a direct connection (break) in the encircled legend, so it's done on the backside instead of the front side.   I believe WHITE keycaps that are seamless (I've only seen those in China, but the new "Fission" keyboards may have those too) do not have this problem because the rectangles on the back (that are black on yours) are a white transparent material on white keycaps.  And that is transparent enough to let light through.\n\nIt's physically impossible to machine "white" rectangles on black doubleshots in the back.\n\nIt's a drawback of having seamless doubleshot keycaps.  Either buy some white ones from aliexpress, or get the Vortex set (the new 126 key set).
Why not just email them ask for a new USB Breakout board?  The entire point of having them is that it's easier to replace (or solder) a breakout board than it is to have something break on the main PCB and then risk damage to that.  
Hold both windows keys for 5 seconds.\nIf this doesn't fix it, RMA.
The shine 6 uses standard Cherry MX RGB switches with OEM Profile.   Any OEM keycap will fit.  It just comes with "half height" keycaps.
I don't mind the gamer fonts that much.  It's the uppercase "A" on the caps lock key that gets me.  That gets me good. real good.
Soldering is easy.  Quite easy actually.  It's only hard when trying to deal with SMD or super tiny resistors.\n\nIt's DESOLDERING which is the HARD PART.\n\nHere grab this.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E1ISGH0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWM69C4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n(if you don't want to deal with the desolder pump in the above kit, this thing will serve you so well, you can even charge people to desolder stuff for them).\n
Basic keyboard?  Ducky One nonbacklit.\nLeopold, filco.\nDucky shine 6\n\nPretty keyboards?  Realforce RGB $$$, Ducky Year of the Monkey $$$\n
Uh I bought it.  Used it to desolder switches on my YOTM.
Some of the blue switches on the iKBC have been known to be very inconsistent.  Both my samples had very scratchy blues.  kbwarriors said his F87 also had inconsistent blues.  Another user reported issues with the browns also, but I have no way to check that.    YMMV.
It's the basic color per key customization mode. FN+PS or FN+pause.
They're both made by the same OEM.  They are both the same.  Buy whichever one has the features you want.  But I wouldn't recommend any of them.  The G710+ is overall a more simplistic keyboard than the Strafe, but still uses nonstandard bottom row, and keycap stems are prone to break.
Worked quite well once I figured out how to use it!

Bought SA 1976 Numpad kit from /u/DaBears128

Nice of you to do a Giveaway! :)
How is the build quality and performance of that mouse? So far I like quality of the Logitech mice and dislike the quality of the steelseries and R.A.T. mice I've had. :)
Treat yo self! :D
I too think it's boring but I got in for 2 sets.\n\nI would've regret it if I didn't join. Especially when it's going to ship and everybody post the pics :X\n\nIt also supports the community. I hope that results in more interesting german GMK GBs! :)

Well congrats mate! I hope it comes back as a GB :P\n\nCarbon is also coming back, so there might be hope...
I don't really like those buttons on the side. I only use 2 of them at max.\n\nI would actually prefer logitech since I know the quality on those is somewhat good. I come to the conclusion that I'm not really interested, sorry. :/\n\nThanks for the offer tho!

most of them have been bundled in trade only offers, mostly ppl trying to trade up for KK, Boop, or Bros. this is just what i have observed. \n\ni have not done a detailed market analysis, but i dont think snappers are going for much more than ppl paid for them - probly just to cover shipping.\n\nglws. interested to see if you find a buyer
If I have an address change, how can I handle that? 
Remindme! Three weeks 
holy shit. did you just flip those pulse sets for nearly double what you paid for them?
Still better contrast than SA Chronicler
It's there a list for the founders addition? I put in for one during IC phase, and made another order just now in the GB. I don't need two of them, but how do I know if I'm in? 
Oh, you sold off ALL your pulse. Dang, did you even open those kits you bought from me? 
confirmed
Did you try keyboard tester.com? Just for an outside source in case there is something screwy with the software or firmware 
They're all the same, he's just acting as middle man for ppl who didn't but direct from taobao, so shipping is taking longer (I'm in that gb also)

even more reason you need to beef up your dimensions. 0.38mm of any material will not withstand the sheer force of a water jet. also, laser is much less expensive if you can have the shop run it through a sander afterward.

I don't dislike the set, but this is yet another purple and cyan colorway... 
Have you plugged in the keyboard without holding down flip to see that your computer recognizes the keyboard normally? 
even more interested in the (proper) Cryllic alphas
machining that backspace should be no problem at all /s. what is that? 1mm? maybe 2?\n\nalso enter and both shifts are plenty close to those screw slots
I think the key is a standard 1u. The case just makes it look like that vertical bar is part of the key. I had to take a closer look 
I'm in! Hope to be lucky enough to get one of these amazing works of art

pretty sure the kbd75 is a design by [kbdfans](http://kbdfans.cn/) that they originally sold through their [taobao page](https://world.taobao.com/item/541449437611.htm?fromSite=main&spm=a1z10.1-c-s.w5003-15549902218.1.pvuEDr&scene=taobao_shop). i vaguely remember iso being added during the group buy
its an acrylic version of the ZZ96. here's what it looks like now\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/5qAHB\n\ni'll be desoldering the rgbs underneath and installing rgb strips with a denser distribution for more lighting. then i'll probably sell it on mechmarket

which version for POE switch?
i guess that makes it three different types of ppl then...
kindly disagree with your market valuation of snappers
No Carbon? ;) great collection there, and nice keyboard 
Yeah, i can tell even from the pictures that these are super high quality (some are even quad-shot) artisans. Can't wait to get these in hand 
i need what you have been demolding. if this gets me closer, so be it
I think those turned out very nicely. Good job 
[comment] 
So all those wild colors are painted, not anodized 
$50 for a set of DSA is a pretty good deal
That is great! Because I already have GMK Classic Retro, 9009, and OG double-shot sets. All I'm really interested in is those special mods 
you know, i was really interested in this set last year and could not find it. now i am seeing at least one of these sets pop up every week
that is a great deal

^ this. \n\nI paid $250 for my Weller WD1 eight years ago, and maybe $40 for various tips since then. I will probably never have to buy another soldering station in my life 
Nah, I think I got in the first hour. Idk, though. The GB posting today was pretty unexpected... I've been following this since the beginning, so I would be bummed if I didn't get in the founders edition 
Yes plz. This would be perfect for my Mira when I get it 
this does not readily apply to keysets. GMK and SA sets have a low probability of being rerun (unless produced by ctrl alt...) thus each set is rare by definition. i have never seen the price of a keyset go down, and i dont expect to.
O_o  oblivion 
Ok, thanks! 
where's the numpad?
Yeah, blank spacebar and turn those banners into mod kit add-ons. also, do the f-keys they look so out of place. I like where this is going, though 
Uuuuuh the beige ones? Yes immediately, they do not look good. Black version is the closest you can get to 1:1\n\nThe beige ones that are on her taobao don't have leather
i agree, but more manufacturers in the market will not devalue the sets already existing, unless they can produce a product that rivals the quality. so far, Signature Plastics has a monopoly on SA profile, and GMK is the king of Cherry profile. clones have come and gone and SP and GMk just keep getting better.\n\nyes, the existing sets can be reproduced and recently some have been. we have not seen them on the second hand market yet, but i dont think SA penumbra value is going down due to the recent reproduction. i would wager the same will be true for GMK sets

its a bummer they are trying to run all these sets this month. why not spread them out a little? my wallet does not need a replay of january
all this teasing...
looks like yours was soldered on Dec 5 last year... lol
Somewhere I read about someone (helpful aren't I) using dental bands to Jailhouse his blue switches.\n\nI kinda think dental bands would be soft enough to feel mushy even to an o-ring fan like me but I haven't tried them. The o-rings I've used have been much harder than I remember dental bands being.
Ohhh I see. It really depends though. I can easily switch them with another, but for now it's blues. 
Well people dental band the HHKB all the time. Not sure how well it works for MX switch caps though.
Why use o-rings on blues? It would not reduce the overall sound much, and it would only make the bottom out feel worse.
I disagree with both of these people.  O rings reduce the clack without affecting the click.  Gives a nice clean feel due to the cushion when bottoming out.  \n\nAny kind of O ring will work as long as it fits, but it might have slightly different feel the other O rings.   Just gotta test them and see
Can confirm it does almost nothing
Ah I see that now. Oh well, it was the cheaper version :P

2 second sell out but it took 30 seconds to move to the checkout page
I am getting the mechmini and I have to say it's a great way to know if you like 40% or not. The budget friendly build is perfect for me bc it will be my first 40%, and If I don't like it, no biggie. At least I didn't spend $100 more on another 40 that is just as good. \n\nBut..... to contrast that point, I think the Lets Split is a perfect way to know if you are into smaller, ergonomic, or ortholinear keebs. \n\nI chose the mechmini over the Lets Split because it is much less of a gamble. I have never typed on an ortholinear layout so putting a lot of work (like soldering diodes and stuff) into a keyboard that I may or may not like is not as rewarding for me. \n\nIdk this is all my opinion and you have the right to choose a keyboard that fits your needs however you please.

Pm'd for pepe
WHAAAAT? That's crazy! Thanks so much /u/90N1NE and /u/Alveeno
About the beige sneakers, did she get leather/something similar to leather yet? I see other grey fog boots for sale but they are the same material as the black boots.
Yes /u/fate bought those
First column is shoulder width\n\nSecond I have no idea :/\n\nThird column is clothing length
Damn. Probably swamped with Christmas present orders. I hope I missed that and get it sooner
Mhm, I hear ya. It may be too similar to other sets. 
It looks like Mustache Shoes is better than Nina. \n\n[Also they have a factory product video with some Avril Lavigne in the background lol.] (http://tbm.alicdn.com/bCN4Fxiv6u5QAgRzScQ/4TGUPpSJQTjHmzxJuGd%40%40sd.mp4)
There is one for sale on gh for $130. (Him not responding to my PMs is a little weird) but thanks for the suggestion. Budget raised to $175
Sounds good. Thanks!
Jolly Rancher Red\n\nMmmmmmmmm
OW Varsity isn't loading for me
Did they just receive them? Is that why some prices are lower?
Was about to post this. Op should pick up some Marcelo Burlon, Gucci, and SLP reps 
They have a long way to go imo. Thanks for getting in contact with her so often!
"Just another black boy with a felony" YEAH. It's called aggravated assault and he deserves the felony. As I like to say, imagine if the suspect and victim were flipped. A white 16 year old beating up and robbing a black 17 year old. I can see it already, MSM reports it as a racially charged hate crime. 
Mx\n\nI think my favorite thing about this sub can't be brought to a specific moment. Every day I love to see the diversity of posts we have here. Some build logs, questions, artisan photos, and most importantly, the memes. 
I don't know. Could vary between products as things usually do. Maybe try messaging the seller and explain your problem to him
Filco camo TKL with Filco double-shot SA keycaps and wooden palm rest. Cherry mx browns, they feel very linear compared to the browns from my KUL ES-87. SA Keycaps are more enjoyable after adding the wooden wrist rest. Wish it had dip switches like my KUL but overall I'm satisfied for now.   
I got a few of those keycaps in my grab bag, I think they look absolutely great. 
That's some very nice keycaps.\nI've never seen spherical keycaps with modern legends.
Such a nice texture on your wrist rest, mine looks like garbage lol.
They are a bit brown, but for a camo keyboard they fit well. 
Thank you! 
Awesome keycaps, but I do wish they came in black. 
Well congrats I'm not over thirty. \n\nAlso couldn't get a reverse coil to work. Why don't you offer some suggestion. 
The question is *when*? And how long do you leave it in the oven for? Do you wind in the opposite direction immediately, or after letting it cool? 
Well I found it but that seems crazy hard. I guess I could try it I have a drill....\n\nSo, oven at 200F, but for how long? Then do you wind it the other direction immediately or do you let it cool and the wind it the other direction? \n
you can roll each one at a time or you can connect it to a drill http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Coiled-Wire/step5/Reversing-The-Coil/
lol the twist I did is garbage. \n\nI'll try the reverse twist. I think it makes the most sense to let it cool to room temp or so before reverse twisting. 
Best luck, friend. :)
All you kids and your cordless phones. Everyone over 30 knows about reverse coiled cables.
Honestly I have no clue... I just read the thread... 
It looks like your initial coil (in the OP) is pretty okay.\n\nTo get the tighter coil, after it's cooled and set into the initial coil memory, then do the reverse twist. You can do it by hand, it's not massively time-consuming for a short coil.\n\nFull disclosure: I've only done this twice before, but did a fair bit of reading beforehand.
Awesome! Let me know how this turns out!
I tried to do this and had similar success to you, as well as the reverse coil ending up in a mess.\n\nThis one is a tough one and I think you just have to experiment. I wasn't able to get a better coil. The people that sell these each have their own way of doing it, and they'll keep it a trade secret. My advice would be to key experimenting till you get a method that works for you.
Blow dryer works fine, just takes a bit. its all about keeping it wrapped over night. I just used a long screw driver as a base and it worked fine
If you haven't already done it, reversing the coils after the initial twist will then tighten the loops. Basically, see the 4:00 mark in [this video](https://youtu.be/wTmzg6WMnf0) for the general idea.
My guess is the following: Take the inner conductor cable (the four small wires sleeved in plastic, the one I got from keyclack is sleeved in white PVC). Coil that, including using the reverse coil method, and then sleeve that with the paracord and techflex (if applicable). \n\nI haven't tried it but so far it's the only idea I've come up with. 
You have to coil it the other way. It's a strange process to reverse it. I'll try to find the old thread.\n\nEdit: [Found it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3knyp5/helpguidepretty_diy_usb_cables_sleeved_and_coiled/)
If you don't want to tinker with it yourself, Pexon has a pretty nifty [detachable USB system](http://pexonpcs.co.uk/collections/all/products/new-style-mod-kit). It'll work with the RF internal connection right out of the box.
I'll upload a build log after its done.. Still waiting on some final parts.
Nib upward when carrying it. Uncapping, usually horizontally?
Hey. If you're around for the next hour or two I'd love to play\n
A clean mech with numpad is hard to come by sadly. The numpad just adds a bit of heft. Two suggestion. The [zz96](http://imgur.com/ScvGnVb) is pretty hard to come by and will be expensive, but you'd have the coolest mech for miles. Another option is building a separate mech numpad like the [KC21](https://massdrop-s3.imgix.net/product-images/kc21-mechanical-numpad/MD-25661_20160812142914_822e6a5c9ed7c981.jpg?auto=format&fm=jpg&fit=crop&w=1023&dpr=1) or Clueboard Cluepad. That way, you can take it off your desk when not using it for an even CLEANER look. WOAH!\n\nEDIT: [The world is your oyster](http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p750x750/15875685_135544150281113_1489573372118433792_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQyNzE0Mzc5Njc4MTM0MzkyMA%3D%3D.2)\n\nEDIT2: As for swapping between multiple devices, you can always go for a wireless usb hub. They are funky but do exist. Some boards you can mod easily for bluetooth use also (I know it's common for the hhkb).
Needs more LED
I just got myself one for Christmas. Hands down my favorite in the collection!
Needs more LED
Sometimes desk space is more valuable than a window...
The first things that jump to my mind (in order of expense): a second, preferably larger monitor; speaker upgrade; upgrade to a minimalist case. 
Picture cam out a wee bit blurry. But I can assure you that soft fine nib is lovely!
I dont drive often. ~3 times a week. And is also stored outside year round. I have a very stunted battery life.
Platinum Century 3776 in Chartres Blue??
I was literally about to post the RevLimiters that I installed yesterday before I saw yours. Good work.
Well I was indeed planning on going Aquamarine, but honestly the special addition/color deal doesn't interest me all that much. I'm mostly just going for utility. That and I already have an Eco :).\n\nFrom what I have read, you cannot go wrong with the 3776. And, depending on where I buy it from, the price can be cut in half. Now I just have to decide on nib. Thinking of going SF.
That's what I was thinking. I haven't changed the battery in ~2 years, so it would be well over due.
Surprisingly no. I filled it last night. Carried it around this morning, sat down, and bang. I think it has to do with the motion of walking when it's in my pocket. Although I do put it in nib up...
Total, I have something like 7 computers. So yeah... It's definitely a want not a need.
Nice 11900. I just modded mine with a USB breakout board for detachable USBs ... and I dropped in modern 14k 55g springs. LOVE IT. Very affordable 'vintage' mech.
Is no one going to comment of the casual Grace Hopper. For the love of God people pay your respects.
Whipper snappers these days. Can't even recognize where they came from... *grumble grumble* millennials *grumble*
It was lovely until that keyboard.... god whyyy... and then it continued to be lovely.
Nice to see /r/mechanicalkeyboards is making its way over here. Lord knows this sub needs a little help in that department.
Always nice to see more Linux on this sub. Deb and Arch are my primary distros too!
Have you seen [DSA keysets on a 60% board](https://massdrop-s3.imgix.net/product-images/granite-keycap-set/MD-15020_20160111164948_b66c0d810a9aba49.jpg?auto=format&fm=jpg&fit=crop&w=965&h=292&dpr=1). SUPER clean.
Trust me, I've done everything short of begging to get my buddy to learn with me. The rest just respond with "I ain't made of money". Sigh
This sub needs more Linux....
My advice: new desk and keyboard... In that order. Otherwise I think you are well on your way! Happy computing!
I laughed myself to tears just from anticipation.
The aluminum case was a good call. I'm waiting for my pcb now, but I got my case molded in matte acrylic. I'm happy to see Atreus is getting more and more popular!
Honestly 3 things: Mount your monitors to the wall or get them off the desk with a stand. That'll give you a bit more desk room. (I know its a small thing), but turn you desktop forward. I know you want to look at all the pretty hardware, but again, your desk will look deeper. Finally, give a 60% or TKL mech a try ... because again ... more desk space.
Dammit! I just developed a clueboard obsession and this isn't helping!!
Ok certainly not vintage. But that it defiantly it. I'm assuming it takes a standard international converter?
I love it when you talk dirty to me.
As I have learned.
Pmd
I'm honestly with you there.
Platinum Century 3776 Soft Fine
I do indeed. Just not with me at that moment
Pmd
Do your eyes line up with the bezel?
I might very well take you up on this offer. Once exams finish of course :(
In other words... rub salt and vinegar on the barrel and let sit for a day?
I would use any legend as long as it were on a SA..
Pmd
This has been sitting on a shelf for the past 10+ years, so I'm assuming its just an age difference. They probably changed the nib along the way.
probably $250-300 with the set.  they are $200 just for the kit i think
I know it'll be 100+. I usually like the seller to give his asking price first. Feel free to PM me. I don't bite.
I can't quite place it, but there is something I really like about this station
This might be the friendlies sub (and community) I've ever seen.
Why?
Im playing Duels and what not to tide me over and teach me the basics until I start frequenting Friday Night Magic.
Would you happen to have any pictures?
Love the Realforce 87u. I'm working on a detachable USB mini mod using an Adafruit breakout. This sub needs more keebs...
Ahhh true. I never have thought of it that way. Looks like I'll have to his buy the Novatouch outright though.. Or a realforce.... Ahhhh
Pm'd
Do you find it just a WEE bit too fine?
I just got the exact pen in a SF nib. Do you find that the nib is almost.... too fine?
How are you liking it. I went vertical a little while ago and I still can't fully tell if I like it.
Welcome to the family!
Your friend done broke it.
Since when do we still call them panhandlers?
How do you feel about that gap between monitors? I feel like it would urk me...
I did the same last week, after about ~2 weeks of being introduced to the game. Never be too hard on yourself, and NEVER get discouraged. Chances are, you're playing with veterans, and chances are, they'll kick your ass no problem. You can be a little embarrassed (I know I was), but just know that this is the worst you'll ever play and everyone started from where you are.
It's certainly on the fine end for fine pens. The feedback is present but it's a part of the writing experience. I'm enjoying it's a lot so far, but both the flex and the Japanese fine nib are taking some getting used to. My converter is coming in 2 days, so I'll let you know later how it goes later with better inks.
[It's so beautiful](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/09/so-beautiful.gif)
I do think the silly aspect of the set has appeal, and with a charming, almost naive styling it could be sought after. That being said, I really only see this on 60% or smaller. Nothing about the numpad is special
Specs? 
I just ordered a waterman proprietary off goulet and am soaking out any dried cartridge ink.
Writing sample with Pacific ink?
I see your answering most questions. What dev do you actually do? Currently studying CS and curious...
I just ordered a set for my Atreus build. Cannot wait!
What nib is that?? The shadow really peaked my interest.
I have two monitors and a laptop stand. My desktop runs windows and I use it for gaming. My laptop runs Linux and uses for software dev. It is nice to, at the push of a button, switch from 2 gaming monitors to 2+laptop developing screens. I just want to be able to do this without having to unplug and plug io devices each time.
Ahh. I just saw your post. Thumbs up. Luckily the atreus I'm building has those wonderful cutouts.
It's nice to see someone with better taste than "gee I could really use 104 leds to illuminate my typos". From one mechhead to another, I thank you.
Sitting here using Arch with i3Gaps on a T60 ... I think you nailed it.
Personally... stands >>> wallmounts. They are more versatile and can be swapped around for nearly every monitor config. Wallmounts are ... well ... mounted.  
I love ortholinear boards, I love the functionality of a tkl, and I love split boards.. My soul is in constant disagreement.
I'm sold! Thanks for the advice.
You don't know frustration until you start running Linux. Either way... it's clear you put most of your time into your desktop. Now how about some wall art!?
Google SOC! I'm considering applying this year. Any suggestions?
I daily with that exact pen!
I see you /r/mk...
The case ... so much room for activities!
Why cant I buy Topre Novatouch switches :(. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHY
Any recommendations. I was looking around and I didn't like all that I saw.\n\n**Edit** I really don't want to spend more than 200, and it needs to support dual monitors.
The more I use it, the more I love it, and the better my penmanship gets. I just picked up a steel nib and wow... worlds different. Now I'm spoiled and not looking back. 8/8 would recommend.
^ Sounds like the dream. I will 100% be looking for some Friday Night Magic events near by. Everyone has had different responses to this post, but the one thread everyone shared was "GO MEET PEOPLE".
I was going to suggest you come over to the wonderful world of Linux, but I see you a .NET dev ;). Either way, love the progression.
Next step: braided USB Cables :)
Setup a layer to right shift, right control, right super, and right alt to toggle arrow keys!
That doesn't look like any apache sunset I've ever seen....
I can hear my desktop wheezing in the distance.
PM
I actually think I'm going to do all three. I've started on Duels casually. I've also had offers for people to teach my on MTGO. AND .. of course .. I do want to go to a few Friday Night Magic events, because new friends area always a good idea. I love this community!
Would it be spatially feasible for the top lid to also be the wrist rest?
I had to stop by. Recognized the Vim + i3 combo from a distance. I'm running mostly Emacs + i3-Gaps on Debian. Care to share a bit more about your distro? Dotfiles (^.^)??
[just for you](https://imgur.com/gallery/5b3n6) 
Is there a good way to actually judge 'the best shop'. I wouldn't mind driving a bit further to a friendly, better shop.

The game itself is very nice. I've been a fan of the Forza Motorsport and Horizon series and I'm liking the direction this game goes. I think most reviewers have enjoyed this one as much as I have.
Love it. Excellent work.
This. I kept having to reset mine during the first I had it because of the Fn lock. Turned out that the Alts were getting mashed in my backpack.\n\nI really wish there was some sort of switch to flat out turn the KB all the way off for travel. Hmm, maybe I could mod one inline with the battery...\n\nEdit: Looks like [I wasn't the first to think of this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/5pzd32/battery_connector_type/)
Here's my US market 10AE... depending on the light, it can look pretty dark, but in the sun it's a very deep.and vibrant blue. https://imgur.com/a/hWPN7\n\nHope that helps.
Hmm... I used to drive one of those. Always wondered what it would be like if I'd carried my mods through to the logical conclusion.\n\nYours is hella clean, though. Good work.
Most of Chrome OS data is synced to your Google account with your faves, extensions and preferences. Most 3rd-party Chrome app data is stored in the cloud somewhere since they're essentially web apps. And most of your locally stored data is synced to Google Drive in some way -- as least mine is, YMMV depending on your prefs.\n\nSo, I think you're covered. Cloud sync is one of the primary pillars of Chrome OS.
The PowerCore+ comes with a symmetrical USB type C-to-C cable, which is the only one that I've used to charge the bank and then turn around and charge my phone, and a USB C-to-A cable that I've not taken out of the box.\n\nI may be showing my ignorance here, but I thought the issue was with the type-C to type-A cables drawing too much power and not the C-to-C ones, so I haven't really thought twice about it since I only use the symmetrical connection.
I'm surprised more people don't want to keep Carr.  The dude is so consistent, even if he isn't the most flashy player.
I currently use the Google Photos backup and clean function on my Nexus 6P but even if I regularly clear out the photos on the device, I still have a 2-3 GB .thumbnails file that the Photos app keeps in storage for browsing the cloud stored pics. The more photos you keep in the cloud, the bigger this .thumbnails file gets.\n\nThat's to say nothing of movies stored offline for viewing on planes, music and podcasts kept offline for listening to on the road and apps/games that seem to be getting larger every year. I'm constantly bumping up against storage limits with my 32 GB model.\n\nPlus, Google's changing the way updates happen with the Pixels that, if I'm understanding correctly, means that a redundant upgrade partition could end up taking up more reserved space.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but if I were to pull the trigger, it'd be on a 128 GB because it's better to have more than not enough when dealing with non upgradable storage.
Not long at all. It only took a few seconds for the PC version to pull down my save and a similar amount of time to go back to console. I don't think the process is dramatically different from syncing between two Xboxes.
After having my driver's door repeatedly hit while parked, I found a guy selling a replacement in good condition. So I drove an hour and a half out to pick it up, of course, in my Miata. Yep, that's a Miata door in the passenger well of a Miata. The drive back was... windy.\n\nHopefully, I can get the new door in place soon.
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
Noice.
I gotta step my game up.
Mine works with Google Fit. I don't even know what Moto Body is. I'm running an LG G Watch R, btw.
I fly a lot, so I get the "what's he doing here" look all the time when I get bumped up a class on planes, easily ignorable stuff. But so far nobody's ever actually *said* anything out of pocket to me. Sometimes, I wish they just would because direct conflict is easier than dancing around subtle/perceived bigotry all the time. Is that odd?\n\nI also get a lot of people who assume the black dude in the hoodie is clearly not boarding with business class, so they just walk right in front of me on the boarding line -- those, I take great pleasure in checking.\n\nHaving said that, this article brings me mostly joy at how she handled herself and a bit of annoyance that she even had to handle it in the first place.
It's lovely. A bit longer and a tad softer suspension than the ND, but a noticeable boost in torque. I like torque. Also got to autocross the Abarth, which firms up the suspension and cranks up the exhaust note. I was hoping that it would sound as good as the 500 Abarth, but i just barely doesn't. Still, it's an excellent option that feels different enough from the Miata to justify its existence. More Miatas/Fiatas are always a good thing. :)\n\nYou should start seeing more reviews soon. Fiat's embargo on driving impressions lifted tonight and I'm currently working on my own review over the weekend.
I'm also playing on PC. The facial animations for most of the characters still look robotic but, yeah, the skin textures are on point.\n\nI see what you mean about the non-lethal being much more forgiving. (I've finished a lot of missions with just the drone and jumper; don't even need to get out of the car.) That — and, as a black nerd living in the Bay Area, a healthy dose of wish fulfillment — is probably why I'm enjoying myself to such a degree that that I've not been super critical of the story or the characters' motives along the way. When I think about it, though, I also agree with you that the story is paper thin.\n\nI played the first Dishonored for about one hour before popping the disc out and never looking back. Wonder if I should give it another shot?
Thanks for the heads up.
1) I spend a lot of time travelling, so about 70% of my gaming (Fallout, Witcher, etc.) takes place on my laptop, but I've only ever played racing sims on my TV, so I'll probably continue to do most of my racing with my wheel at home.\n\n2) The driving is still at the forefront and the cars are still the stars. Managing the Festival is more of a mechanic of deciding what sort of races you want to unlock and what part of the map you want to unlock them in. So if you really like off-road racing, you can develop the Festival in the off-roady part of the map when the time comes to unlock more races. It's pretty organic and not at all involved.\n\nFestival management is also the sort of in-game canon for the Forza Blueprint mechanic that allows you to build custom challenges and races to be shared with the community. So when you start a race, you can either run it as-is or choose to customize the cars, time of day, weather, restrictions and music and share that preset like you would a tune or skin.
As I understand it and as it was just explained to me, there's no separate NDA for the PC version.
Yes, most universal headphones/headsets work with the newer Xbox One Controllers' 3.5mm port and with the launch controller when using the audio adapter. I have noticed that headsets with inline mics tend to not sound as good in game chat as those with boom mics, but YMMV.
That's actually very interesting. I'm not sure that I'd _want_ that effect -- especially in a car like the Hyundai, which already has very cool white illumination for the rest of the dashboard -- but I can see how some would find it useful in a car with, say, amber illumination.
But it is actually 5-6 inches longer, most of the additional length is in the unique fascia, which is part of what you're seeing...
[Pujie Black](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pujie.wristwear.pujieblack&hl=en). I spent a lot of time getting it looking just like I wanted and, while I like trying out new faces, it's my go-to.
That should be sorted out next week :D 
I use the Viewmaster. Here are my thoughts...\n\n**Pros** \n\n* It works well enough and is easy to find in your local Target or whatnot\n* Being designed for Cardboard apps, it's got a very nice activator lever\n* Nostalgic design comes with educational VR apps for kids.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* The app it ships with are pretty crap and it keeps bugging you to buy more Viewmaster discs. \n* It doesn't have a strap; you have to hold it up to your face. That's fine for short sessions, but gets annoying after more than a few minutes.\n* There's no lens adjustment and it doesn't work well with glasses.\n* It doesn't have headphones and there's no room to route a cable to the 6P. So, you either need to BYO bluetooth headphones or listen to the muffled sound through the plastic.\n* The 6P barely fits without a case and gets reaaaaally hot in there.\n* For what you pay, you don't get a lot. I've been wanting to upgrade to the BoboVR Z4; which addresses a lot of my complaints about the ViewMaster and is probably a better deal for the bucks for an adult user.
I agree with a lot of what you're saying. The negative minority tends to stick out the most and really get to you sometimes, but if you think of the countless non-interactions that you have in a given day on the road, you'll realize that the hateful are just that: the minority. I may drive past thousands of cars in a week, but that one douchebag is the one that I'll remember. \n\nOP, Keep that in mind, don't fixate on them, and stay safe.
Yeah. People keep telling me that and I keep finding other things to fix/break/mod first. I've had the supplies for the headlight fix in my kitchen for about a year now.
I was able to spend time with both the Fiat 124 Spider (Lusso [pictured] and Abarth models) and ND Miata. I'm curious how r/Miata feels about the Fiata. Will we welcome them into our ranks when they hit the roads this summer?
Seconded. Dental floss is the business, then just heat the residue with a heat gun or hair dryer and roll it off with your thumb.
I emailed my contact and asked if it was okay to talk about it publicly. I'm no stranger to NDAs.
Mine works with Google Fit. I don't even know what Moto Body is. I'm running an LG G Watch R, btw.
...and I thought one of the benefits of this game was to get gamers out and *walking* around. :)
I'm immediately interested in this game purely on the strength of this concept drawing.
Happened to me once when experimenting with animation flavors to make my character dance or smoke cigarettes. What probably happened is that the character is using the standard animation flavor while equipped with power armor. Most likely used a console command to equip the armor instead of getting in normally?
Speaking as a console peasant, I'm just waiting for Blizz to allow me to hotkey comm. wheel shortcuts to my unused d-pad buttons.
Worked for me. When I moved to the Bay Area a while ago, I found myself in a similar situation where I had no friends in the area. I joined a meetup for young blacks, got really active among the group, hosted a few events, made a few friends and expanded my network. \n\nCould work for you if you're in a large enough city and you don't mind pushing outside of your comfort zone a bit. The trick, I found, is to be active in the group and suggest/lead activities, rather than waiting for someone to tell you where to go. It's way easier to make friends when you're not just another follower.
Literal spit take. Thanks for that.
I've heard reports that the Leatherman Style PS will pass since it has no knife and the file has a blunt tip, but like the other commenter says, you never really know... and the last thing I want is to have to chuck *another* SAK. I also just leave my knife/multitools at home unless I'm checking a bag.
Just picked up a [couple of prints from this artist](http://gdbee.storenvy.com/) last week. Really digging her work and the prints are really vibrant and high quality.
I've been using this [Amazon Basics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1QG/) case for most of my gadgets. It probably doesn't pack down as small as a rollup, but I keep all of my cables, pens, headphones, small junk, and even a big 20,100mAh battery in there. There's pretty good organization inside for big and small items, it's cheap and pretty rugged (at least, it's held up well over the last two months or so...)
Nope. The only animals I've seen after hours on the Xbox One version are on the loading screens.
I've had the hardest time getting my 2013 LTE to work on anything but VZW. At one point in the past, I had it working on T-Mo -- even then, I'd have to periodically reset the modem via command line -- but then I put it away for a few software updates and it recently nothing I do will make it recognize a non-VZW SIM. It certainly doesn't recognize _my_ Project Fi data SIM. Ultimately, I decided that WiFi tethering to my 6P would accomplish the same goal with less frustration.\n\nNot saying it can't be done, but you'll probably have to jump through some hoops to get it working. But if you've already got both, slap it in and see what happens.
Don't forget to check back in with the goods later!

There's no cord in any of the promo pics or videos... I think it's just listed at the bottom of the page as an upsell, not a requirement.
FM transmitter will likely be pretty crap if you don't live in the boonies. What you'll have to look for if you're set on keeping the stock stereo is an FM MODULATOR. The weakness of a transmitter is that it tries to wirelessly send audio to your radio, but a transmitter physically plugs in between the antenna and the radio, so it has a better chance of overriding a weak signal among crowded airwaves.\n\nOf course, installing an FM modulator is a bit more involved than just plugging in a transmitter, because you'll need to physically plugs it into your radio's antenna input and connect the mod to power, which means you'll need to take at least part of the dashboard apart and, if you're taking the dash apart, you're most of the way to a new stereo (the best case scenario for audio quality), but if you're set on staying mostly stock, it's probably the cleanest reversible option.
I didn't *get* anyone to downvote you. And I don't understand why you can't drop this over 24 hours later in a clearly dead thread. You're just coming off like a jerk, man. Stop being a troll.
My German colleagues tell me that there is a pretty big muscle car culture spread throughout many of the better-to-do parts of Europe and that they have pretty big meets.
Yeah, it'll do Skynyrd easy for me -- though that may be the one time my southern accent has _helped_ with voice command. But I listen to some bands with non-phonetic names like SBTRKT, so I know your struggle.\n\nFor the rest, you can pull up a keyboard by pressing the floating button in the artist list, though you can only enter the first letter. You'll probably have to stop the car to unlock keyboard search beyond the first letter. I find that building playlists and queuing outside of the car helps and only keeping the artists that I commonly listen to in my "My Artists" list helps with quickly finding them but first letter.\n\nThe other thing I found is making sure that I was actually pronouncing the artist's name correctly. You probably are for your favorite bands, but maybe Google is mishearing you.
Sadly, it's showing as [sold out](http://www.hotkeysproject.com/products/deadhead-winter-wonderland?theme_preview=studio&theme_preview=studio). I believe this was a limited run.

It's... it's beautiful. Let's see the rest of it!
Fair enough. Thanks for answering.
This. I left BPT once the rest of Reddit found it and I realized that it was basically populated by non-blacks who think that pretending to be black and perpetuating hurtful stereotypes are funny. This is why we can't have nice things...
I've been looking at a similar Surface Pro plus Anne Pro setup. The only thing holding me back is that I'm waiting to see if the next Surface adds USB-C/Thunderbolt for charging as I'm also trying to reduce the number of cables that I carry when I travel.
Those are some nice pics. What do you shoot with?
I was already familiar with the channel, but holy crap, that's such a helpful video. Thanks.
I wish I could upvote this twice. :)
I tried sideloading AA on my Nexus 7 running 6.0.1 with the intention of using the tablet as a head unit replacement and the app simply wouldn't install. There's always *some* way around that, but it's likely that AA won't even install on one of those generic head units (a non-phone device) without some tweaking?
Yeah! Welcome to the club.
Ah, I did (rather foolishly) download the arm64 version. I probably should have known better. Anyway, thanks for the help; imma go duck tape this to my dashboard now. :)
That's why I take the passenger seat out whenever I need to put heavy things over there. 4 bolts and 5 minutes, plus more space for truck mode.
I just used coaxial because a) it's one step easier to install b) they're often cheaper than component sets and c) while I care about sound quality, I acknowledge that I drive a Miata and there's a point of diminishing returns on how clear any audio will sound in a loud little roadster at my budget. \n\nObviously, components sound better if you take the time to shop around for them, because you can aim your tweeter at your ears, but the scope of my project didn't call for them, so I left that as a possible future upgrade/project for once I've got my various rattles and buzzes sorted.
That's why I'm discussing Xbox Play Anywhere.
Probably doesn't make you feel any better, but this has happened to me three times this year... twice in the same week. (And my neighbors wonder why I don't smile and wave at them anymore...) Now, I'm _suuuuper_ careful about parking my car around big trucks and SUVs wouldn't be able to see me out of their rear view or side mirrors. Probably too careful, actually.\n\nAnyway, sorry to hear it dude, but it's a 2016 so odds are good that insurance will sort ya?
I see what you did there. :-D
Just sharing my $0.02. I picked up [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014ZO46LK/) -- same 20,100 capacity but with USB-C fast charge -- last week and have been using it on vacation without issue. I know it's not the exact model you asked about, but I own two other smaller Anker battery banks, two multi-USB chargers and a few cables and have had nothing but positive experiences with the brand.
Off the top of my head...\n\nBAMO is fairly active, if you don't mind a bit of a drive to the South Bay/Peninsula. If you're looking for track time, check out SpeedSF, they have frequent meets at Laguna and Thunderhill (not Miata specific, but lots of Miatae there).
I put my Cadet on the same loop as my Keysmart and hang both on a similar pocket hook. Good to see that someone else thinks like me. :)
For sure.
Nope, your text will still be there in the reply box until you dismiss the notification or hit send, even if the screen locks. At least, that's how it works for me.
What I learned from that was to figure out why I'm really mad. \n\nI was feeling insecure. She wasn't thinking about the context of her words. We were both asking the other person to do things outside of our job descriptions. (Me: asking her to validate my self-image. She: asking me to play the role of girlfriend). That's where the conflict started.\n\nI didn't say anything until I was already at maximum salt and she was caught off guard by how angry I was. That's where the argument started.\n\nMy advice to you is, when you're chill, express to her — like you did here — why you feel jealous, not the jealousy itself. It sounds like feeling the appreciation is at the root of the problem and you shouldn't have to internalize that and the relationship should be better for the discussion.\n\n(Sorry for the wall of text, bro.)
This was my first thought as well. \n\nI had the darnedest time with GPM auto-playing whenever I connected to BT. I found that going into the app and clearing out the song queue helps. \n\nYou may also want to pop the app into its "offline" mode and remove the offending songs from the local cache, but that's no guarantee that Music won't recache more songs the next time you connect to WiFi. I agree that it's very annoying... best of luck.
I keep getting Symmetras that point their teleporters off cliffs. You die, spawn, run into the teleporter and you're dead again. Effectively doubles your spawn time. Don't know why anyone would do that to their own team.\n\nI've gotten to the point where I don't really trust the teleporters unless I've already seen where I'm going to end up.
Look, man. I explained that I'd literally just gotten the game running and was working through the settings as I went along. I also know that shutting off vsync isn't going to magically get me 10 more fps when I'm already stuttering below the 60 fps cap.\n\nI don't want to be rude, but you're coming off as pretty hostile here with all of the negative comments. I'm just trying to share my experiences with others.
Mazda, AFAIK, has zero official Android Auto support and, though Mazda is listed as an Android Auto partner, there's no public roadmap for when/if it will add support. However...\n\nhttp://www.androidpolice.com/2016/03/08/someone-macgyvered-android-auto-onto-newer-mazda-vehicles-yes-this-may-void-your-warranty/\n\nNothing about this looks easy or reliable.
For me, the trouble stems from the fact that there's only parallel street parking in my neighborhood. I'd come out in the morning and find that a truck had backed its tow hook on to my bumper or scuffed down the side of my car parallel parking.\n\nMy new strategy is parking in spots between driveways where only one car can fit or making sure that I'm at the front of the line of cars so no one can back into me.
Weird. After I kept getting the "App not installed" message when installing the APK, I just gave up with the intention revisiting the project this weekend, but now I'm curious. :-)\n\nMy N7 LTE is bone stock 6.0.1 right now. Maybe there's a difference between the versions. Are you rooted? Did you sideboard via custom recovery or just the standard Android Installer?
The Clearwater speakers mentioned above are often mentioned in high regard especially for those who want some plug and play with the Bose amplifier, but I found that — because I was swapping in an aftermarket head unit anyway — that my life was made infinitely simpler and my choices significantly broader by simply bypassing the Bose amp altogether.\n\nAs you may know, the Bose amp uses a nonstandard impedance that makes most non-Bose speakers sound terrible. Plus, there's the issue of figuring out how to feed the Bose amp a pre-amplified signal from an aftermarket stereo. I'd rigged up a setup that worked with a line-level converter, but I ended up cramming a lot of gear behind the dashboard to shake loose and I was never happy with the sound.\n\nSo, I picked up a set of regular 4-ohm speakers that fit into the door holes (8-incher coaxials are hard to find, but 6x8s fit without much trouble), wired them directly to the speaker-level outputs on my new Pioneer stereo and just pretend like the Bose amp doesn't exist. (Actually removing it can be more trouble than it's worth because its crammed way back in the dashboard.)\n\nTrust me, bypass the Bose amp. It's simpler, cheaper and better in the long run.
And I just want to not *accidentally emote* when I'm trying to quickly fire off a "my ultimate is ready" note... and to *actually emote* for the kill cam/POTG.
It would appear that I stand corrected. I'll look into that. :)
I get that, but this seems like a convoluted way to get Google Maps in the car: connecting a phone to another phone to a car. If all OP wants is Google Maps, it seems like a dashboard mount for the iPhone would get the job done cheaper and easier than buying a whole second phone just to WiFi tether. Which is why I'm curious if there's something else at work here. I'm not trying to get too far off topic, just curious is all.
99% of my listening is through headphones. This is far from the biggest letdown, but i suppose and I'll agree that it is one of many potential annoyances that keeps me from clicking the preorder button.
Yeah, man! I was hoping someone would make this reference.
Ha, it's very clean from the passenger side; but the driver's side is all dented up, because my neighbors are small car blind. I've got some exhaust that I don't recognize from the previous owner, but it sounds alright to me.\n\nGlad to see that I'm in good company when it comes to taste.
> Body style: sedan\n\nLOL, wut? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 1999, I see. That a 10AE?
Nice. Glad you love it.
I'm rolling with a 350mm deep corn that I alternate with a 330mm Momo Tuner (oh the joys of a quick release hub). Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
I was recently gifted this game after my girl heard me say that I was the only person in my circle of friends who actually enjoyed WatchDogs 1. I've dumped about 16-20 hours into it and have really like what I've seen.\n\nThat said, while I like that the game has a few likeable and relatable characters, I find that a lot of the voice acting is pretty flat and just not great. (Mostly, it's the NPCs, which are often bad in big open world games, so I'm not tripping too hard.)\n\nWhile I haven't seen much of the racial stuff mentioned in the article, I do like seeing a black dude in the starring role. Interestingly, Marcus has changed my play style compared to the first game. With Aiden — the main character in WatchDogs 1 — I'd get frustrated with a mission and just go in guns blazing to get past it, but with Marcus I'm more committed to the non-lethal, cerebral solutions. Probably has a lot to do with seeing my non-killing-spree self in the character.\n\nI'd be curious to know if anyone else has played this (or Mafia 3, which is also on my watchlist) and hear their experiences.
Maybe relevant, maybe not: I had what I feel is a similar situation with my gf.\n\nWe'd watch a lot of movies and she'd always comment on how hot this or that dude was. I'm fine at first, but I get more and more salty each time.\n\nOne night, she's going in on how hot Thor is and I snap. I ask too loudly why it's okay to say how much hotter these dudes are than I am? I point out that she never tells me I'm hot and I'm right here! We go back and forth, feelings get hurt, everybody goes to bed angry.\n\nLater, we work out that "how hot Chris Hemsworth is" is a perfectly okay conversation *between girlfriends*, but she doesn't have a lot of female friends and I, with whom she spends most of her time and *should* be able share everything, kept ending up on the receiving end of girl talk.\n\nWe never resolve the issue, but she doesn't bring it up anymore. I'm never sure if this was a victory in defining boundaries or a failure to look past my insecurity that made her a bit more closed off to me.
There you go. My ignorance is indeed showing. :)\n\nI just double checked anyway and it turns out that I've been using the USB-C cable that came with my Nexus 6P, so I haven't even been using the packed in cable anyway, heh.
Yeah, but [I did answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/53xk5l/xbox_play_anywhere_i_got_an_early_copy_of_forza/d7x53ha) when I said that I *directly* emailed my contact and asked if there was an embargo and if I was free to speak publicly about it. Again, I stress that I'm not trying to be rude, but you've made your point. You're just trolling now.
Nope!
I have this one. It's actually my second multi-port Anker charger, so I've grown to trust the brand. Rather good.
1920x1080 is the only option that I'm given for resolution. \n\nCheck the screenshots and you'll see that there's a field for framerate. There are two settings there: 30 fps and 60. Capped at 30, the framerate is solid during free roam. I can only hit about 50 fps in the 60 setting, but I haven't fiddled much beyond the automatic optimizations.\n\nI was also told that the official updated Nvidia and AMD drivers won't be ready until the official launch, so I'm possibly running on unoptimized settings.
yeah i think "expensive boards" are more like $500-700, check out this group buy https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87239.0 that board will def feel solid

don't really know how rare white alps are.  You can get an old alps board for like $30, so that is ~.28 per switch.  depends on how much you want to tack on for labor of desoldering.  I wouldn't pay more than $1 per if you are getting less than 50.
transparent switch tops for zealios are just gateron tops.  I think they custom make the bottoms, but gat bottoms are also clear.
so people are saying 65g should have a bigger bump, idk i have a board with both 62g and 65g, the 62g bump feels more pronounced. i go 62g if you want light.  67g if you want heavy.  65g is my least favorite zealios.
what board is that?
my favorite numpad is the leopold.  It's only 60, so significantly less, and it is super high quality.  I just desoldered the browns it came with and added zealios. 
Yeah i use topre for like civ and more passive games, but i found it hard to use for pvp games like league 
Ok just out of curiosity, what is stopping him from say not entering the draft and just like making a deal with jerry before hand that he will try out as a free agent walk on and get first round money?

SP needs to figure out a way to do sculpted PBT SA dye subs in all the colors.  I'd be all over that.  I'm not interested in another uniform R3 SA set.
dont try and force zealios into a pcb, they won't fit.  Just snip off the pegs.
Yeah exactly, im just used to linears for gaming
there is no adapter for a MX switch keyboard like the Pok3r.  the mx sliders you are looking at are for a topre switch keyboard called the novatouch.  Unfortunately you are out of luck trying to get a topre spacebar on your Pok3r.  I'd say you could prob just sell the space on  this subreddit and get another one from PMK.
prob at least $1 - 2 or more a switch if you are only buying 22.  If you are getting more it would go down in price.

Hey guys! Hope you all had a smashing weekend :D \n\nThis is the last 7-10 days worth of cables, we've been manic as ever and we are getting cables out as fast as we can! There are plenty of realllllly nice cables in this update, lots of different colour and shrink combos, great choices as always. \n\nIf you have any questions, be sure to email us at info@pexonpcs.co.uk, PM me here or /u/p3xon me in on the thread. \n\nThanks as always for the continued support! :D \n\nLove,\n\nJames/pex 
Love the PSU and the sata power cables! Cant wait to see my AKG cable to show up
Thanks mate, looking forward to receiving it. 
Yea, don't worry we are working through in date order :) We are pretty busy atm but wont rush things out, we want to make sure everything is perfect :D 
Cool! Thanks for the info, now I just gotta think about what I want :D
I will send you a PM with some answers for you :) 
Absolutely! We can accomodate that no trouble at all. Just make a note in the order comments about that colours you'd like what side. Add on small mod kits/ keyboard side connectors can be added down the line
Was just curious /u/p3xon, is it possible to order the Style Mod kit with two different paracord colors? One color on the PC-side connector and a different color on the keyboard connector side? \n\nAnd would it be possible (in the future or at the same time as the order) to order extra cables for the keyboard-side?
Awesome :D
hey dude, we are currently saying around a month on all custom orders, if you email info@pexonpcs.co.uk Davina will be able to give you an update :) 
Ooooooh fancy! I have a couple of questions!\n\nWhat are those shiny big bulky connector things called?\n\nDo you have a list of different cable colors somewhere?\n\nI have a Vortex G104 with a cable that doesn't come off, am I right that a mod-kit would basically replace the original cable at the chip? Could that damage my board / is it easy to do?\n\nI also have a WASD V2, which I bought with two cables. It's a bit of a hassle to swap them out though, so is it possible to get a: Micro USB-B Male to Bulky Connector + Bulky Connector to USB-B Female?\n\nLastly: what would the price per meter be? And is there a different price per connector? I've been looking at cable mods for a while now and I'd love to have a slight idea of what I'd need to save up.\n\nThank you!
> What are those shiny big bulky connector things called?\n\nThey should be aviator connectors
Hey u/p3xon, how long is the wait usually? I ordered a cable a month ago but haven't received it. I had almost forgotten til I saw this. 
Woop woop! Looks good dude! \n\nP.s. in regards to wait time. We are pretty backed up at the moment, BF and Christmas pushed us back as there was a huuuuge rush. We are currently working through orders by date and I am spending 12 hours a day in the workshop, smashing cables out at a good pace at the moment :D I know the wait is a decent one, but I do hope/ feel that the end product is worth it :) 
Hey guys, here is a selection of some recent orders. Its been manic, so I've not been able to photo a lot of stuff, but here is a selection. \n\nWe are incredibly busy at the moment, but we are working through all orders by date order first, thanks for your patience and support as always! :) \n\nCheers,\n\nJames/pex
Monday more than likely dude
Sounds interesting, lets take this to PM :) 
Yes
I cant get along with SA, it feels weird, like it almost takes away from some of the topper feels... idk. Try the DSA on it, its realllly good
Hey guys, as always, here is a selection of some of our recent orders. \n\nWorking down orders in date order as per usual, so if you cable is not in there, its already made and sent out or we are not on your cable # yet, or it is coiling up as we speak! \n\nIf you have any questions, fire me a PM or email us at info@pexonpcs.co.uk\n\nHappy Weekend! \n\nJames/pex
Its been fun. I just don't use her anymore. It goes so perfect with the PBT KR set, just had my use and want more Topre :) 
Thanks Jack! 
* HHKB Pro 2 (silenced with dental bands)\n* CC F2 Red \n* WASD, Space, Fn and Arrow in red PBT Topre \n* MDPC-X Black with red shrink cable (yours truly ofc :) ) 
I actually really like it, I am playing Rainbow after finishing up in the workshop and it works well. Its not perfect, but when silenced, I really enjoy it for FPS
OG Red PBT Topre caps 
Yes thats possible dude :) Send me a message and we will get it sorted out for you :) 
holy shit
For a 7ft total length with a, say, 6 inch coil, you will need to order 11-12ft total cable length :) Remember to make a note in the order comments in regards to the total length of straight cable and the total length of coil. If you need any help with colour choices, just give me a shout
Oh stop it you guys :3
Which ones did you order?
Cheers man, thats very kind :) I can assure you, you won't be disappointed 
I will be revamping the extension pages soon, keep an eye out on the site in the next few days 
Sounds good to me. If you nake the order as normal i will use your measurements to make sure its 100% bang on for you :D
Does the Novatouch use the same connector as a Filco? 
I sure do! :D Website will be back online thursday/ friday, currently tucked away in the corner of the workshop crying, trying to catch up! lol 
such a tasty combo dude, the shrink doesn't match up in the photos, but IRL its nearly perfection 
Probably better investing in a Molex ratchet crimping tool rather than a manual one
Was great to see everyone, hopefully, we can get somewhere like a makerspace next time, the coffee shop was really cool though, I honestly thought we were going to get kicked out at some point lol
Got any pics? That sounds gooood. Shade 19 is a great choice for GMK Carbon 
MDPC-X Orange would work well, its very bright and will match the orange well. Alternatively, MDPC-X Copper will be a good match as its much more muted and will fit in with the wooden case too. Something subdued and not a sleeving that most will go for, that would be my bet. It will not be a perfect match to the case or caps, but it could be something different, which I what I always suggest. Perfect matches can make things a little boring I feel 
Great colour choices, they fit very well indeed! :) \n\nThanks for sharing the photos I am glad you are happy with your order! 
That looks KILLER! Nice job! 
It should be completed, if not it will be definitely be going out in the next few days. Black Friday and Christmas was manic and has put us back a bit, rest assured I am working my butt off as always! I don't rush stuff out, I want to make sure everything we ship is absolutely perfect :) 
Glad it got there safe :) Nice Pok3r RGB too 
Not to sure atm. Depends on how flooded we get, it may go down on the weekend or we may take it down after Cyber Monday 
We ship anywhere in the world dude! :D 
Micro USBs, we sure do! 
MDPC-X Copper would be nice, its a deep brown, or if you wanted to go left field, MDPC-X Vanilla Sands will be a good contrast that will pop! 
Really? I didn't know that. I will have a look. But once you pay customs and duty... 
Looking good! Super clean
I will have to check again, i think it is the  3edc keys
Hello! 
Awesome man! :D Wheres the link? MDPC-X is super nice, the atomic green is so hard to photo though, may be a little over exposed/ brighter than usual 
When you get to the checkout, where you pop in your shipping address, its on the right hand side :) 
Cheers! I used to have 3 HHKB and a Realforce 87u, but I sold them all, trying to get my collection back! :D I actually took 45 mins out tonight to make myself a cable too; I am around them all day but rarely get to make anything for myself
Thanks! :D

2* ooops my mistake. I have 2 now again though :D \n\nI'd love a 660C. the 980C looks realllly cool, it may be my next board after a custom ALPS with SKCL Greens
Awesome! Be sure to share some pics :)
What do you mean by top view dude? 
Can't go wrong with a nice pair of AKGs :) 
Its simply called [550] Miami :) looks great with purple shrink or clear shrink and gold connectors when single sleeved 
Just one shade of black on there :) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxRX6LXDpWs
[550] Teal with black heatsrhink :) Where did you email us dude? 
Cant wait to see this board if you are at the meet up dude :D 
It moves around a little too as its so light, I do think my Novatouch is better for gaming though, especially with DSA. \n\nP.S There is no end-game ;) 
gOOD LUCK : d
Tough one. Both the HHKB and Nova are silenced, they both rock, but the 86u is probably my favourite, when its silenced, it will be even better 
Awesome, glad it got there safe! :D 
For GMK Carbon, you cant go wrong with [550] Safety Orange and [Techflex] Carbon for the double sleeving. If you want to go even jazzier, go for [ZOMBIE] Corrosion (thats one of my favorite combos ever ;) )  \n\nFor Symbiosis, something simple like a [550] HMS Grey with [Techflex] Platinum Grey will be bang on, that is a lovely combo too. \n\nFor the third link, it seems broken :( 
Hey guys and girls! I hope you all had a very nice Christmas and you enjoyed some time with your friends and family. \n\nIts the busiest time of the year for us, but we are back to work tomorrow and we will be pushing out orders as fast as we can. \n\nThank you all for your continued support! \n\n<3 James and Davina \n
Hey guys! \n\nAs you may know, we took our site down late friday night due to the amount of orders that came in, but we've cleared some orders over the weekend and have popped the sale back up, I cannot guarantee how long it will stay up for though. \n\nFor a full list of all the offers that are continuing, check out this link here:- http://pexonpcs.co.uk/collections/black-friday-1\n\nCheers,\n\njames/pexon  :) 
Here you go dude:- http://pexonpcs.co.uk/products/sata-3-6gbps-data-cables :D 
No sorry. I do not collect Artisanal capkey. \n\nMeme-ge-force GTX 69 does not it is smoot OTE_MU
The cables should be able to hold up to it, the RCAs have a fair amount of stain relief. You may have noticed I upgraded your connectors too. I need to take ViaBlue jacks off the website. The Oyaide connectors are better in every way, better quality and fit more devices. MDPC-X white looks killer too! 
but the one that ran yesterday also had issues?
Hey dude, just got back to the PC, will check it out soon as I have a fair few PMs to sift through, don't worry, I will get back tonight! :) 
Cheers Will, hope it was ok to do so :X 
Hi mate, seems as though you've found it haven't you? Only just got into the workshop so I did not see your message overnight. 
'tis a very nice cable and an awesome colour, you'll have to show me some pics ;) 
Yea, we recommend going through the standard checkout :) 
Hey guys! :) \n\nWe have some pretty cool stuff up for grabs this Black Friday. Heres a list of what is discounted\n\nFor 15% off ALL cables, use code:- BLACKFRIDAY\n\nFor 30% off ALL sleeving supplies (excludes MDPC-X sleeving and tools), use code: SUPPLIES\n\nSave up to 50% off keyboard sleeves here:- http://pexonpcs.co.uk/collections/black-friday-1/products/laptop-keyboard-sleeves\n\nThere are a few things dotted around the store too, that are not in the above list, so have a look around ;) They are first come first served and will be deleted once sold automatically ;)\n\nTo see all the of applicable discounts, deals and items, check out the link here:- http://pexonpcs.co.uk/collections/black-friday-1/black-friday
Thanks dude. What headphones have you got? 
confirmed\n
Arrow cluster! :D 
Ahhhh, never knew that. We can do that for you then. I am still not sure how much internal cable you will need, is there any chance you can take off the case and get us some measurements? \n\n
Finished up this set as an example of MDPC-X colours and Icemodz combs. MDPC-X holds is shape like no other sleeving, the colours pop so well too! 
Its so good. I reallly dislike SA and DSA, but, DSA works really well on it. Even better when silenced with dental bands, its so quiet 
You may need to swap some wires around on the Novatouch PCB side of the mod kit 
Replied 
I would gladly have my ears talked off with James May helping me solder cables in my workshop! :D 
The shrink tubed wire? It is completely crimped on there :) \n\nYou may have to do some tweeking on the Filco pinout for it to work on the Novatouch
Thanks for the support dude! :D 
3 core shielded oxygen free copper for most of them and then Teflon silver for the braided ones 
Hey! I do not have a Topre RGB, but I would imagine it is the same internally, but I cannot say. I will see if I can find some images of the innards
Hey dudes and dudettes! \n\nHoly moly, what a hectic last few weeks, what with black friday, christmas and the r/mk meet up (which was good, I can't wait for the next one!). \n\nWe have a hoooooooooge update this time around, lots of pretty stuff and good to see some nice MDPC-X cables going out too, on PSU and USB cables. \n\nAs always, hit me up via PM, /u/p3xon or email info@pexonpcs.co.uk for any questions, order status's etc. Thanks you all for your continued support at this time as we are incredibly busy due to the time of year, we are making good progress, but we never rush orders out just to get the number of outstanding orders down, quality comes before everything! :D \n\nCheers r/mk\n\n<3 james/ pex
Davina should get back to you tomorrow with an update :) 
Thats in the workshop at the moment ;) 
send me a pm :) 
I've been contemplating it, the red blockers look so cool 
yo yo 
absolutely! 
Thanks for the offer, I will have to look at getting the controller sorted out first though :D 
oh no :(\n\nI should've checked :P
Ik ben helemaal voor goedkope groene energie, maar tot alles op groene energie runt lijkt het me geen goed idee om kerncentrales te sluiten.\n\nSluit dan eerder alle vervuilende energiecentrales, want klimaatverandering zal de wereld uiteindelijk veel meer gaan kosten dan de opslag van nuclear afval, lijkt mij.\n\nMij lijkt het dan beter voor het milieu om kernenergie nog eventjes door te laten pruttelen, tot we compleet groen kunnen zijn.
Awesome! Congrats to the winners!\n\nEspecially /u/vwlou89 , besting me by a single point ;)\n\nI look forward to the next competition :D\n\n
:^D
vgm verkloot je het milieu meer met kolencentrales dan met kerncentrales
It's great when you're with friends and either high or drunk. It's also great when you've got nothing to do and you want to collect all the hats.\n\nFurthermore it's a physics based platformer like others have said. It's definitely worth $2.
I'm not saying we should limit blowby, I'm saying we might be able to check for any *excessive* oil loss, relative to other teams.
Mee eens, schade aan het mileu is moeilijk te kwantificeren, zeker tussen twee soorten vervuilers.\n\nHet is een beetje appels met peren vergelijken. :P\n\nHet liefst zou ik ook zien dat er *en* geen kolen verbrand hoeven te worden, *en* geen kernafval gecreëerd wordt.
Om nog maar niet te spreken over hoe intens veel schoner het is dan een kolencentrale. :P
De meeste gemeente hebben helemaal de kennis en het geld niet om de juiste jeugdzorg te leveren.
yeah now we just need confirmation that Ferrari screwed something up and they're set\n\nagain
Ja precies, het is een beetje afwegen wat uiteindelijk beter is.\n\nHet liefst zou ik ook compleet over gaan op groene energie.\n
Efficiënt ships are literally cheaper regardless of oil price.
He probably ran out of oil.
Rip hahaha
Ik ben bang dat mensen niet goed genoeg geinformeerd zijn over de politiek om tijdens een referendum een goed overwogen beslissing te nemen. Mensen worden heel erg snel beinvloed door de media die op hun gevoelens speelt.\n\nHoe hoop je dit tegen te gaan?
Is een maatregel als dit dan niet de symptomen oplossen in plaats van het probleem?
Why does the nose have an intake thing
🏎️🏎️🏎️
Yeah but if you shoot something 100km up it falls right down again. Getting to orbit is enough to get anywhere.
oohhh useful\n\n*edit: oh man that intro hypes me to no end*
Is that... *hope*... I feel?
I wonder what the FIA would do.
Meer geld naar defensie?
How's weather in Siberia this time of year?
Wanneer gaan we peilingen verbieden?
Help us Obi-Wan Ferrari, you're our only hope :(
Sure, but it's still a competition. There's no chivalry in robot combat.
can someone photoshop the floorplate out?
So he's not going to be driving then?
Dat vind ik mooi :'D
Ben ik het wel mee eens. Waarschijnlijk zijn we over 20 jaar al een stuk beter in het produceren van groene energie, en dan zullen kerncentrales steeds minder nodig zijn.
Pick me
I hope we'll get a true rainbow grid one day.
iew :(

Be careful though, joints get very jittery when exposed to too high velocities.
Yeah but that could be taken into the equation right? Account for that, leave a bit of wiggle room for any errors in measurement, and then check if even after all that the Mercs have still lost more than their opponents?
wtf nascar
This investigation concluded no performance increasing substances were present in the oil.\n\nI thought the current rumors weren't about that, but of pushing oil past the piston  rings into the ignition chamber.\n\nI might be wrong but these don't seem related.
Fair enough. I wonder how he'll fare in F1 now though.
Neither am I.
The next species won't have enough fossil fuels readily available close to the surface to spark an industrial revolution though. We mined it all.
:^^^)
Yeah I'm gonna need some images for reference :^o
That'd be the best thing :(
Zijn ze dan ook extreem voor een basisinkomen en een nationaal zorgfonds?
Ik heb hetzelfde probleem met de SP. Ze zijn veel te extreem en populistisch.\n\nOok zijn ze behoorlijk *anders*-EU, terwijl ik het liefst zo veel mogelijk EU heb.
How did you LOD roads? I'm having trouble with roads being loads of polygons, which is fine for physics to play nicely, but can be a bit of a hassle at a distance.
Yeah but it makes sense doesn't it? They're all there to win, and if wrecking them in the head to heads means an easier time in the final, then it makes sense to do so.\n\nI'd say don't hate the player, hate the 2hrs repair time.
Entering because every board needs a Skulthulu :D
F1 cars have a maximum amount of fuel they can burn. 105kg as per 2017.\n\nThe oil allegedly, as I understand it, bypasses the fuel system entirely, and gets combusted along with fuel.\n\nThis means that they would be burning more stuff than their competitors, which results in more power.\n\nOil in itself isn't very useful as a fuel, but 105kg of fuel + oil is always better than 105kg of fuel alone.
Can't wait to see it on track!
Pick me
I'd say he just thinks he shouldn't get sole credit for the car.
Imagine if it was suddenly super reliable and horribly quick.
Right, that makes sense.\n\nHow else do you think something like this might be measured?
Rip Dutch :(
secret max verstappen confirmed
The power required to reach orbit is more than the power required to crash anywhere on this planet. I don't understand how you think that is not the case.\n\nYou can hit the other side of the planet even if you never reach orbit.\n\nSure, your angle of decline is really shallow, but you'll get there.
Because half of the entire population has a below-average intelligence.
o dat klinkt idd niet zo heel goed\n\nMaar het punt blijft opzich wel. Al zijn het 2 of 3 of 10 voetbalvelden: het is niet iets wat onoverzichtelijk is, *zolang er geld in gestoken wordt*.\n\nDat laatste is vaak het probleem.
...wrap it up, boys\n\nsee ya'll come 2018
Waar ik vooral bang voor ben is dat kerncentrales gesloten worden ten koste van het milieu.\n\nAls je kerncentrales sluit moet je ook een alternatief hebben die de energieproductie op kan vangen. En het zou jammer zijn als ze dan bijvoorbeeld kolencentrales een tikje harder zetten.
Renault and Mercedes could lend them Prost & Lauda :^)
oh come on
Tolerating intolerance is stupid.
I was kind of waiting for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feA64wXhbjo) to kick in
I hope to see them again post-2020\n\nFor now: goodnight, sweet prince :(
Nice ik zal t niet meer doen :P
**Space-o**space
Actual glass or some sort of plastic?
:(
Riiiiight... Dat is problematisch.\n\nWat kan er dan aan gedaan worden? Want het is overduidelijk dat het de verkiezingen op een negatieve manier beinvloed. Hoe ga je zo iets tegen?
Nice, mooi om te zien hoe de afname van kernenergie opgevangen wordt met wind en zonneenergie.
Do you two know anything about orbital mechanics?
I made a custom visual studio theme with a waem yellow/beige background.
They are so nice 
Oh my, what the hell.\n\nStroll ~~is~~ was really reckless.
Your username does you justice.
well this is bullshit
That can't be right, Hamilton was racing karts when Max was born.\n\n*edit: rip lol I thought signing his first contract meant his first drive in F1*
Yeah very true. I was only pointing out that distance itself isn't an issue anymore.
Yeah but why not put an entirely new engine in then, If yesterday's one had compromised components?
Yup, ik ben erg benieuwd naar die technologie.
They mentioned the ~~sun~~ *star* would be at least half a billion years old because of something or another. No idea about the planets.
Kapsalon?
Why didn't you just roll your own vehicle physics?\n\nA raycast and some maths is basically all it takes. I gave up with standard Unity wheelcolliders on day one, and it saved me a huge hassle when working on my own game.
Oh no :(
Als je al het kernafval dat in de afgelopen 40 jaar geproduceert is op een hoopje zou gooien, dan heb je een football veld van 7.3 meter diep.\n\nhttps://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/On-Site-Storage-of-Nuclear-Waste\n\nIk heb het idee dat dat wel redelijk goed te onderhouden is.\n\nWel jammer dat er vroeger goedkope mensen waren die het afval maar in oude zoutmijnen dumpte :P
Upload the image straight to Reddit next time :^)
Yeah I roll solo.\n\nI know my strength though, and adjust my artstyle according. I can't texture for the life of me but I can build a rockin' 3D model.
Hmm interesting. Thank you!\n\nThat sounds kind of like the system I've already got in place. I do my terrain in patches, so that I can later LOD them individually. (which is going to be a hell of a lot of work unless I manage to automate the process) I'm kind of sloppy at the seams though, and just overlap patches of terrain because for a solo dev I don't think it's really worth the hassle.\n\nAlso: I loved the Driver games when I was a kid. It's very interesting to now simply run into a guy that worked on them :P
Damn it all to hell
"oh okay we'll stop now :^)" - Mercedes\n\nEdit: Just a thought - could FIA possibly measure oil amounts before and after the race?
what the hell is that fin hahaha
Well then face the bridge :^)
I use the nono all the time! I just put a wider key cap on one of the sides and the osu! caps look a lot better in the k70
I didn't notice it that much like after 2 or 3 songs it felt normal 
Same\n
I had reds but they were to light, So I went to blues but still didn't feel right so here I m with greens. Lol 
Oops I have the Nantucket Variant II Non Toothy \nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z8KyGiD.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6GCjDnN.jpg \n\nSorry 
Well sorry I was trying to learn something and asked for help in a place where people would know about it.
Hey I am taking the switches off this week but here is the back of the K70 \nhttp://imgur.com/a/Et6Yp\n\n(sorry all I have is my nexus 6p)
Thought about it but it was empty with no logo.
Thanks 
Never Mind the lighting makes it look Black and pink but it is the brunt one. Lol my bad \n\n\nOops sorry i miss counted but the one on the far right in the first photo. Is that one in the sale ?
I haven't looked to see if there is a switch. and afterburner shows normal readings 
It is called a nono, I got it to play Osu! You can get it from here \nhttp://store.ppy.sh/store/product/20 \n\nIt has a nice program to set it up also 
If you are willing to trade that pink one let me know ! ;) I\nI got the danger close one in my blind box 
Milky milk ?🤣\n
Is that the RGB Mouse as well? \n
confirmed
Yea I that plugin in the roaming and 4.0 installed 
I have used it for the past 3 or 4 years and been fine 
Is that black and pink one on the end in the sale ? I see 8 caps but 7 options 
I can't really tell which way this profile goes tbh. I really changed it out to a DSA 
I am thinking of doing this to my k70. How hard was it to remove all the switches? do you need to remove the leds as well? 
Same I am really hoping he responds soon. I really don't wanna go through PayPal for a refund 
Yes!\n\nMods don't really help.\n
Thank you !  But then he wouldn't run through the bottom row!
Pmed\n
Got the same one !
Nothing really, they are just really soft for my heavy hands 
I misplaced it but I found it and it is on there now
Geek keys sell abs caps made for the bottom row
Love the design!!\nKeep up the great work  
That teal howl key is so nice !!!
The SMD led make it alot easier to desolder but you have to make sure either to make your switches or get SMD compatible switches. Also they used a heavy solder 
Yay I hopefully made in on this one in time !
I have the vortex white caps on my K70 RGB and they do look great but the bottom row disent fit 
Yea I'm not sure then I haven't had any strange issues \n
If you ever wanted to part ways I would be willing to buy some off you 
Fuck I already bought it in reds :(
Pmed\n
:( Lucky.. I am tramp stamped over here 
I have two fans pushing air in the front. While having a H100i on the top pushing air out. 
Hahaha yea the ous! caps are really nice but to small for the nono. 
Sweet! Thank you !
Damn OP respond to my PM 
Yep AX 2016
No love for SMD Led ones?
Pmed
confirmed
How much did it cost over all? Just wondering \n
That Star wars one ! I would get a tkl so fast !
Well I had red switches and the Greens I bought were not smd switches so I had to open every switch and swap the spring steam and top of them all. Only had one switch break 
Does CUE see it being connected? If So try updating the firmware and like they said change the polling rate using that switch on the back. 
Yea I am the one waiting for switches. I may just end up doing that too.

Did the GB Close i can't join the Fusion one
So i'm not sure if it is this skin but the media buttons are not working for me. I have had this issue with most media skins.\n\nOther that that I love the skin\n
Here is a [screenshot](http://gyazo.com/96f57032e0ef0654d70ce7a22ecd075b) using open hardware monitor 
That Void Cat would look really nice on my K70!
I don't mind having to install CUE but then again my K70 is always on my main computer 
Oh my bad, this one also decided to uninstall Windows and wipe my drive clean forcing me to move back to Linux 
Pmed\n
Oh my bad its more like B. I linked it in the post
Sweet are you doing PayPal or is it listed on your site ?
Entered for 3 ! Nice work
I am in the middle of removing my switches on my k70 RGB 
I just did a similar mod to my K70 RGB. I didn't buy the SMD mounted switches so I used the bottoms of the switches that were on the board already and just placed the spring stems and top cover on them. Mine are work perfectly fine 
28 Thank you op !
I am running Linux Mint on my Yoga 900 at the moment. Its running smooth and fine.
I do have that installed but its still not work but whatever its not to big of the deal 
Thank you For the giveaways!!
Thanks ! The black keys match the wrist rest 
What Board is that I have been looking for a compact one with a ten key.
I can make a profile when I get home later. Just pm all the color details 
I'm really hopping this time!!\n
Yea here you [go](http://gyazo.com/56159969c603f083eaa4c79017eef86a) 
Pmed\n
Thanks!
I have a Nantucket variant IV classic. I can timestamp it when I get home later today \n
They do work but it goes through CUE for the lighting 
I like g20 caps! Let me know if you got any space bars or printed ones 
I love DSA keys if your looking to get rid of any of them ;)\n
Pmed
The pc is very cold all the time, could it just be a faulty sensor?
Yea i don't mind the bottom row too much, I like the line of black keys.\n
Damn I always miss it :( these look great btw
S9 sad I had one in my cart hit pay with PayPal ... And poof they are gone .
I was going to just put the Greens on but then just thought if I had to remove all the switches I should just paint it. \n\nWith the paint I washed the plate completely and then with the brushed aluminium look it was basically already sanded. I just picked up some glossy white metal spray paint and then a glossy finish\n\nI did maybe like 3 light easy coats from a far distance and then one solid coat of finish. Let each coat dry for like an hour each. By just painting it right it didn't have the sticky feel that comes from spray painting. \n\n
Bought a Nova Touch TKL from u/rtc129
I'm about to do this as well. I am changing out the springs from reds to greens. I will be painting the top part white. The K70 is a bit easier since the switches only have 2 pins and LEDs are not in the switch.
I have missed this 3 times in a row ... This sucks I hope more come in stock :
confirmed
Love the board! I have been wanting to build the same one over the past couple months. 
Fuck...\n
I Know that i was asking to see what I needed to do to fix it. \n
Is the Mech60 Clear still there ?\nPmed\n
1) Yes I would ;)\n2) If you made just a tk like this I would buy it for my job\n3) Well yea RGB Leds!
Here you go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a497Hom8Gg
I have the same thing happen. Are your Cut Scenes choppy as well?  
Pmd
I put them all back on and the right way this time, it does fell a lot better to type on now !! :)
Yea mania is just a tad different ;) I was never able to play mania 
Not really any other choices unfortunately. 
Yeh G20 is pretty much it, with DSA probably being the next closest.
Can we still enter this even though there are already 100 entries?
Been lurking for awhile now. Might as well join had to make an account haha. Thanks for this!!!
Thank you SO much!
I gave it a shot! I really like those blue modifiers! I might actually have to buy the magicforce 68 I've been mulling over if I win this.... 
Yes go ahead
if you give me a guess and guess exactly, ill send it :)
Wow, thanks for doing this!
Not going to enter but this is kind of you to do! :D
Thanks! I just wish I had more to give away
no problem! I hope it helps someone get more into the hobby.
What's conus? 
It's very kind of you to do this. I won't enter, but good luck to everyone.
So nice of you man! Thank you!
Appreciate this fam!
Contiguous United States
Check your inbox :)
no prob!
Love it! Do you have a link to the pattern?? 
I've been there!! Its a beautiful place. Wonderful picture. :)
I actually have the potato dog that I got from the creators of the game!
Pick me!
I got as far as renaming the payloads, I'm a little lost there. Mine currently say "def_Dec9.bin" "x_Uncart.bin" "y_emu9.bin"\n\nWhere do I find what to rename them as?\n\nThanks for the reply
Haha always the first reaction! I'm dyin' for  fugu! I need to start my artisan collection :)
So for 3D printing the model needs to be airtight. So one big piece with no gaps. Some people achieve this by overlapping edges of each part into the other parts. High poly with no uvs is fine for the print. \n\nFor game, use this as tour high poly and create a low poly base mesh off of it. Game engines can't run high poly objects as well. So go as low as you can without losing over all quality. In substance painter you can bake the maps from the high poly onto the low poly. Make a normal map bake and anything else you might want. Export all textures and there you have it! 
Thank you! The dark red one is Sedum spathulifolium “Purpureum” in case you were curious. \nThe little Totoro was the cherry on top on my way to the nursery checkout, couldn't pass it up!
If the rocks are glued onto the top of the soil, I'd remove the rocks. Just something wrong with the idea of applying glue to succulents. Will make it easier to replant later before they get all overgrown too. 🙂\n\nEdit: just noticed the comment above mine mentioned this!
I'd get one depending on if I can afford it!
Love it!
Lookin good!
I love the Lucky Beast cap! Monkey king is pretty awesome as well.
There was a art challenge hosted by Artstation recently, the theme was "The Journey" so I'm guessing that may be it. :) 
That's the plan! Just gotta figure out how to do the colors. :)
Looks great! The only thing I might say is that I feel the eyelashes should be made in the same style as the hair and eyebrows to be more cohesive. Nice sculpt 😊
Lets try morph targets then:\n\nHit center pivot this will put it temp in the top toolbar in the transforms pannel. It will put it at 0,0 world space so your deformation is centered. Store a morph target in the side menu for the subtool. Under the deformation pallette shrink size by a small amount. By default it should stink in xyz.  You may have to turn off Y...it depends just try it both ways and see what works. Under the tool pallette>morph target> create morph diff. It will create a brand new tool in the tool pallette. It will come in reversed when you append it. \n\nTool pallette>display>flip to flip the normals. \n\nHope that works. 
I see what you mean, I was going to ditch the text for the first batch anyhow. I chose impact to try and retain the lettering through the print since it's easy for shapes to get lost. Definitely still a work in progress. Thanks for the feedback!
No problem :)
Entered!
Love to hear it. I'll post again when I figure out the logistics and have some ready for sale. Thanks!
Hey everyone, quick question. Im still on ARN and would like to update to Luma so that I can play online again.\nWhat do I need to do to update??
Good point, I'll follow the guide exactly. Thanks!
Nooo not Gudetama... I'm getting one!
I would recommend working from concept art. I'm going to be a bit honest, might be harsh but very important for character art. \n\nThere is no emotion, I can't even tell what the different holes are.. Eyes? Mouths? There's no distinct forms to help the viewer see the anatomy. I really have no idea what the character is feeling. \n\nKeep working on it, watch tutorials, work on your forms and anatomy. Keep with it and you'll see a lot of improvement!
Just committed for the TKL :) Good price! Most wooden ones I've seen are $30+.
Booted up just fine and connected to the internet. Thanks!!
I'm looking to spiff up my new board.

I have the stock pbt caps that came with my Poker 3. Thanks ahead of time!
:)\n
Thank you for the info :) \nI'll be sure to stalk their site haha. I'm just dying to replace my stock pok3r caps. 
Dynamesh usually does this when the mesh is too thin. Try going back to before you dynameshed it and use the inflate brush or standard then try it again. If not, try to close the holes after dynamesh with the inflate tool then control click drag. It will look ugly but you can smooth it out later. 
Found very cobwebby spots on one side of my poor succulent this morning. I found one little gray bug and a bunch of little red pods under inside the webbing. Picked them all off and repotted into quarantine from other plants. Help!
Im very afraid of that!! I'll make sure to check thoroughly.   Thank you!
Looks like they probably are from google images!! Lowe's really let the poor babies down, the other two were completely rotten. Thanks!
I'm guessing because it was made in 2D software. (PhotoShop and illustrator) \nIt may look 3D but it's truly not. ☺️
Super excited for this!
Ok, I'll check some out. Thank you!
Hmm okay, I'll read over the directions again and see if I misplaced it. Thanks!
Gotcha, thanks! :)
Is this Claude Monet's garden?
Hey everyone, quick question.\n\nI'm at Part 3 of Plailect's guide for Full stock to arm9loaderhax CFW guide.\n\nIt says I need the most recent copy of CakesFW, could I use AuReiNand instead?\nThanks!\n
Ah gotcha. Its not a bad sculpt by far, just could use some proportion refinement is all. Also, the line around the the lips needs to be smoothed out though :) Grab some photo reference and move some stuff around, I think you could fix a lot with just doing that. Keep practicing! 
I agree! Have any recommendations?
Thanks! I think I caught it pretty early. :)
The cotton candy paracord ones would fit great! I think most of the makers in this sub have that color. \n\nEdit: went to get the link to the guy I just bought mine from: \n[u/90n1ne] (https://imgur.com/a/jyE9b)\n\nThere are also other makers in the wiki :)
Hmmm okay, I'll keep trying too. Glad you got it to work!\n
Are you trying to realistic or stylized? Were you referencing? The face is very front heavy and over elongated in the mouth and chin area. I feel the back of the neck doesn't really need to have a bunch of rolls, kinda makes it look strange. 
Sculpting in zbrush definitely requires artist sculpting ability. Sure there are some advantages like being able to sculpt cleaner lines, but it shouldn't be deemed as novelty art because it was made digitally, in my opinion. 
Peel them off :P its only a small top layer
Interesting, on the top screen it says under the homebrew launcher: "/3ds/TinyFormat_v1.0.0/". \n\nThe opening menu after pressing the TinyFormat tab on the main menu gives me the option for 3ds and region free launcher. 
Yep I did successfully complete the downgrade to 2.1. Thanks :)
Sorry to bust into your conversation just had something to add.\nIf you're working with dynamesh on you can also just click+ctrl+drag on the empty workspace to make the polys uniform and fix most errors you're getting in resolution in those areas. Even on a hyper realistic sculpt with facial pores I've never had to go past 5 m polys. I would also recommend making the mesh into different parts.. For example if your character is wearing clothing you don't need skin under the clothing. If you really need to cut down the poly count you can also make a duplicate of the subtool, zremesh then project the more detailed mesh onto the retopo mesh. 
There you go. Sometimes you have to do that sort of thing. 
Wow, I, missed so many! Thanks for these :)
Oh! That makes total sense now. Thanks! Is that how the giveaway is done as well?
It is pretty spongy, so is my split rock. I think I'll give them an itty bit of water and see if that helps. Thanks!!\n
Another question!\n\nIm trying to run the Universal injection generator master to back up my saves. I added the hs.app file and FBI.cia file into the input folder but am having issues getting a fbi_inject_with_banner to generate after running the go.sh (mac).. thanks ahead of time\n\nEdit: I ran the generator on my PC and it worked out fine\n
This is definitely it!! I wish I was able to get a better picture, I had a group of clomping hikers behind me on the little trail. I don't remember a smell, maybe it wasn't completely bloomed yet. Thank you so much! 
Definitely no problem with variety. I'm planning on making more characters soon.
I've been using a mix of 3/4 cacti mix to 1/4 pumice. I've heard other people say that when the lithops get older they do better in a less soil-y mix. Maybe 1/2 of each? I would do more research online before following my advise though, I'm no expert by far. 😊 Good luck! 
Sure thing, thanks!
I love how your lines are precise to the nature of the plant but not perfectly straight. Keep at it, I can't wait to see more. :)
Not yet, Im on the IRC but no one is responding to my question. What about you?

Do you just rub it down with rubbing alcohol?
Hi guys, I've run into a snag in Part 4 of the guide.\n\nIm trying to run the "http://dukesrg.github.io/2xrsa.html?arm11.bin" in the browser, the screen says loading arm11.bin, then flickers for a second then stays on a blank browser screen when it should be launching OTPhelper. \n\nIf it makes a difference, when I boot, it boots to a black screen if I have the SD card in. I need to boot without it then click it in when its on the home screen.
No worries! Its still a nice sculpt either way. :) 
I realize this may be late but I'm interested! I may get too busy with work but would love a little project to play with. \nThanks!
Have you tried projecting the texture to a duplicate model then exporting/importing the texture file back in? Sometimes it gets wonky for no particular reason in my experience. Especially if you are going between high and low poly. Just gotta trying different things till something works. Good luck!
Sure thing!\n\nhttp://www.yarnspirations.com/patterns/crochet-family-moccasins.html\n\nI took some creative liberties on mine 😜
It's really personal preference... But it doesn't sound like you've modeled before. Have you? If not, you may be starting with something more simple like a pencil. 
I bought the little one like this from HD as well and all the rocks were glued together in the top 😓
I'd love me a FUGU! Not sure what RNG is but I'll write it in here!\nThe light blue would be perfect for my Poker 3 that just arrived :D
Thank you!\nYes! It's Crassula Picturata 😊
I keep meaning to make my way out to that nursery! Another place near there I go to is called Cactus Jungle in Berkeley. It's not huge but they have a lot of cool varieties. In case you were up for another trip  😊
Do you happen to have anymore lithop for trade? I would love to add to my little collection! I'm still in the process of IDing many of mine but can pm you some pics of what I can trade. I'm also in CA too :) 
Oh no no. I'm using a succulent mix. I just like how it looks with the perlite covering the dirt on the top of the lithops. 😊
Sweet. What ended up working?
Couldn't put the book down!! Definitely recommend reading it. Pleasant notes of classic sci-fi with just enough suspenseful mystery. Wonderful read. 
Great! Is there anything from ARN that I need to delete? Or should it be all good to go?
Could I possibly get some recommendations of any reputable sites to order a DS cart for my DS backups? I know most of the carts work the same but which one is the "best" one out there now? I've been looking at the R4I Gold Pro for 15$ off of rev3Ds. I'm running 10.7 currently. Thanks! :)
These look cool!
Why don't you split the mesh into multiple subtools? It would be the best way to keep that gap you want. You can split the mesh by polygroups in the subtools menu>split>groups(or polygroups, something like that).   You can also split by masked. \nAlso this plug in is much better than the built in dynamesh. It wont deform the mesh, its wonderful. \n\nhttp://www.zbrushcentral.com/showthread.php?177194-DynaMesh-Master!-unofficial-Information-Installation
Have the invoices give out yet? I keep checking my email like a maniac!
I'm really excited to see such a cool giveaway. I just got my first mech keyboard in the mail yesterday and love it already. I told myself that I wasn't going to fall into the artisan trap after buying my poker 3, well that lasted long... I would really like this key to start making my board pretty like everyone else's!
Ahhhh that's why it looks so similar ;)\n\nTaobao?
I went to college\n\nI decided to learn to slack line\n\nI grew a pair and asker her out ;)
Oh man, love that color on the giveaway!!

No invoice for me :(\n\nedit: Scratch that! Just got it!
Whats the current going rate for the PBT Valentine? I can buy it for about 80$... sounds pretty fair?
My recruiter told me that they started rolling boards in the beginning of September. 
I wish I did, it looked much like how when you roll a piece of printer paper up into a tube by the corners. I think it hadn't completely opened yet. I think we found the answer though! "Scoliopus bigelovii" :)!
Thanks for the link, checking it out now.
I just looked, what confuses me about the directions is that it said to put the files in the "/3ds/" folder, I took that to mean the same "3ds" folder that is in the root. Is that incorrect? I also just dropped the folder containing all the content in there. Should I merge the 3ds folder and drop all the other stuff in there without the main folder?
Sent you a PM :)\n
Hey everyone, another question!\n\nPart 3 of the a9lh guide #23: TinyFormat opens fine, but when I click "Y" it brings me to a description that says "NetLoader Active-Waiting for 3dslink connection IP:...." Am I missing something? Thanks again!
Dynamesh can introduce a lot of errors to meshes that are too thin. Something else you can try is to go to the subtools menu and make it the only visible subtool (also make a copy)>remesh(not zremesher) turn off the "x" in the remesh button> turn up the resolution size and click remesh. It will create a new subtools at the bottom of your pallet. From there you can project the detail from the first mesh onto the new mesh in the subtool menu. If you don't know how to project in can help you with that too. Then divide up and project until it gets to where you want it. Theres another method with morph targets if that doesn't work. Good luck!
I think you need to dig much deeper into the waves and folds of the clothing. Also, the skirt/tunic thing is a bit short, makes it look kinda funny with those beefy legs. The face could also use some more dimension and characteristic. In my opinion! 
Happy to be a part of it. Let's do these more often! 
Oh! Silly me. Thanks for the info! 😊
Welp I'd buy one from you :D\n\nEdit- just read your other comments, you are a hero! (not trying to sweet talk my way in, I just genuinely appreciate what you're doing!)

Buying something to sell it for a higher price feels more like exploiting other peoples wants, while buying something to trade it feels more like a mutual "I appreciate this thing" from both sides.\n\nGranted someone paid for it so clearly there was a demand, it's still irksome (to me at least) to see someone turning a neat community event into an opportunity to profit.\n\nThe original maker put time and effort into making the caps so of course it's reasonable to expect they ask for profit as reimbursement for their work, all secondhand sellers do is sit around and exploit other people's desires. \n\nI think what bugs me is that they haven't "done" anything to earn the extra money.
Yeahhh
Pmd 
http://www.hotkeysproject.com/\n\nEventually, whenever they go up for sale.
Sweet! I just found the tracking for mine :D
Not at the moment no, they come out in batches. To win one you have to sign up and then have your name picked, then you can buy it from the maker.
For what it's worth, I have found that gateron switches are "better" because they are lighter and smoother. So if you are looking for a switch with a little more resistance to it, cherry will be the brand to check out! Personably I prefer cherry switches to others, because of their extra weight.

I've got a Turtle Beach impact 500 that came from a reseller for $50 and has held up to daily use and monthly teardowns/ modding!
It's a good price and I hope someone is enjoying it. Not a hostile remark at all!
Holy shit
Keycaps can be replaced with ease, I would look at the way the body/chassis of the board is shaped and consider that for the sake of appearance. \n\nI'd also say that Blues start of as pretty neat but after a while the clicking got kind of irritating for me- check out MX clear switches, I think they feel as good/ better than blues but without the click. Consider KUL- they are pretty much a dead brand but you can still get their boards from a few places online (elite keyboards I think). \n\nPersonally I love MX clears, and have owned boards with both switches. 
What does the second payment usually turn out to be? I am looking at the site but that sketches me out a little, is it usually a small charge or...?
Nah if I was being snarky it would be very apparent ;)\n\nI'm just happy to see a Snapper not listed at $90, and hopefully it was bought by someone who wanted one and didn't get it in the raffle!
That would be interesting to see! Did you find the list? If not I can hop on my pc and post it here.
Will it be blind bag again, or can we at least have the choice of which range we get? (Any blue, any green, etc.)\n\nI've been kind of put off by blind bag raffles, but I'd love to join if we can pick a color range at least :D
Right but I didn't realize it was programmed that way out of the box!
Pming
What is a yellow mob?
Are pcb mounts typically a custom affair? \n\n\nI like the idea of having very heavy linear switches (150g+, as my 80g still feel disappointingly light) but don't necessarily like the idea of having to tear down an entire board to swap switch springs. Assembling/ disassembling a switch doesn't bother me at all, but soldering is still a bit tricky for me. Maybe I just need to practice a bit more and get comfortable with the idea?\n\nA PCB mount board would be nice since it doesn't call for all of that, but having the solder joints and board take all the load put on the keys seems like it would affect the durability/ lifespan of the board.
PMing\n\nEDIT- disregard PM
I know the v60 does that, didn't realize the pok3r can as well!
You'd be amazed how straightforward a lot of things are once you take them apart ;)\n\nThe biggest challenge I had doing the same thing (with a different board) was making a clean cut in the plastic. 
Fuckin Volvo man...
Depends on where you put the equation. In algebra, no. In coding, yes!
That's awesome, when I was first learning to slack line with a buddy he was my friends idol!
PMing
I'd jump on that! :D\n\nUnfortunately so would someone who would flip it :/
Just making sure, typically it's "US-TN" so I wasn't sure if you were in like Tunisia or something lol.\n\nAlso I'm sending you a PM
Was this from the most recent sale? I still haven't gotten shipping info on mine D:\n\nAlso sweet caps! :D
Fair enough! For the chance to grab one of those blue fugus, I may just risk it ;)
Yeah just shoot me a pm!
Just wait until someone brings up knockoff keycaps. ;)\n\nYou can get "brobots" for very cheap (under $20 shipped) from China! Some people don't respond well to buying fakes though.
Pming
No idea, never checked
Where is TN?
Cool! It looks straightforward enough. Do they take pcb mount switches or need plate mounts?
They are heavier but not too much so. To me, Reds are unsatisfyingly light while blacks tend to put up enough resistance to let me know I'm actually pressing down on something.
Pick me!
Craft beers and keyboards together sound like a pretty solid evening to me!
Lucky Beast is pretty neat looking!
Version 1.1.2 I think? I see that under the "about" section.
If you need someone else to justify a purchase you probbbbbably don't actually need it ;)
PMing
I think it's between the screen and case, since you can kind of chase the air bubble around the screen if you press enough (I know it's bad for the screen but just to give you an idea). \n\nYou can see it more clearly when the backlight is off [here](http://imgur.com/GihZyby) compared to when it is on [here](http://imgur.com/fjzcSTg)
Ahhh okay. Yeah you'll have to buy them from the aftermarket on /r/mechmarket\n\nExpect to pay around $70 for a fugu and the same for a brobot (depending on the version you go for)\n\nEither make a post asking to buy them or just lurk until you see one! (Or do a search)
I agree! Everyone has their own thing.
He wouldn't put up with that. He's just too damned sensitive!
You don't need to know how to resolver to move the port! The breakout board (with the connector) is tied to the main board with a bit of wire, so really you could open up the board, cut a new location in the base, and then fasten the board where you want.
No worries! :D
What's the cheapest diy kit for a mech? I'd like to tackle my soldering deficiency and I think building a working "thing" would be more rewarding than just taking something apart and putting it back together again.\n\nMaybe a numberpad, a pcb with 4 holes for macros, or even a low cost full board. I'm open to whatever, as long as it's not super expensive!
Hall Effect keyboards are super cool! Magnets!!
I hope that Snapper was bought to be enjoyed and not just flipped :D
PMing
There are fake fugus as well, but they are still kinda pricey and look really bad lol\n\nThere is a list of things to buy on TaoBao from a while back (you should be able to search for it) and it's got links on there if you want to see it.
I'd hop in on that! Especially if they were available in cherry profile as well. 
Looks great! \n\nI want one now :D
I was gonna say the look like wake boots xD
What are the keycaps supposed to be? They kinda look like clouds to me...
If you're willing to offend half the community there are some cheap knockoff artisans, most of them don't look that great compared to the original though.
Set yourself a goal and make it a reward! But like, a big goal. Idk what but make it your incentive to better yourself!
Yes, typically much cheaper if you can win one.
I looked into the site a little more/ read their FAQ and ordered a $6 keycap as a feeler. Seems like a good service, I'm excited to have found it!\n\nThanks for the info :D
I know >.<\n\nBut since there's going to be cherry profile stuff soon, I'm kinda glad I waited! That will actually match what I have now lol
Pming
Welp I still prefer Cherry
Ughhh that Saber is so tempting!
Awesome! There are some "similar product" links on the pages as well, they have some cheaper options. I paid around $5 for a knockoff brobot before shipping ($15 or so after)
Just in case you haven't read it yet, a commentary on the misspelling of "a lot":\n\nhttp://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html

No the silicone protector is just for the body, nothing over the screen
What do you expect shipping costs on the eagle to be to Fl? Seems like it would be a good board to practice soldering on...

Plus the LEDs are another component to eventually fail. I like my boards to be simple and not full of frills!
What's the colorway on that brobot? I saw a knockoff with the same colors, it looks neat.

40A seems pretty soft, maybe try something a little higher up on the durometer scale like 50A.

Blahhhh 6 week business trip just as all sorts of cool updates come out! 
Follow the links and use a proxy, I have used TaoBao focus without any issues. Just copy the URL into the entry box on the site and it's pretty easy to follow from there. "Second shipping" should be around $7 to conus.\n\nFind some real ones in /r/mechmarket !
You say that like they won't end up spending all their money here anyways ;)
Everything Keyforge is awesome!!
My justification for a mech is that \n\n1) It feels good\n\n2) It looks cool\n\nIf you can accept those two reasons you don't need to worry about anything else ;)
UCF Craigslist page on Facebook is a decent mix of cheap mini fridges and people selling their stuff for exorbitantly high prices.
What sort of coding do you have to know to set one of those up?
I've always known a magicforce could look awesome and I've always known this keyset would look awesome. Now I realize they were just missing each other! :D
What was the holdup to the group buy that prevented the sets from being distributed to everyone that bought in? It's odd to me that a small scale private buyer was able to make a purchase while a large scale group buy was not.\n\nWas it poorly run or a money driven issue?
Pming 
Damn, form was open, checked the price, then it was closed lol
I'd like to think I make the community better by not selling my stuff at high costs :D
$25 + $5 shipping
Awesome giveaway!
I dont know really, I just want people to know they aren't brand new or anything. They are pretty smooth though.
There are aluminum cases which will be back in stock this month iirc. I don't know if that counts as better in your book. I do personally not mind the acrylic. Different strokes
[Miami] (https://i.imgur.com/nPWldoS.png) is a color scheme for keycaps, not where you buy them from. No big deal, just thought you'd like to know!
Yeah I'm still waiting for the screws to actually hold my clue together so I feel your pain. I tried blues but they were just too light for me. Greens are just right and the gaterons feel great.
You're looking for a full size keyboard so I doubt you're going to be moving it around a lot or beating zombies too death with it so the actual build quality as far as structure could be negligible. If my budget would allow it though I would go with the ducky because I live on /r/mk and I seen to see more "help my corsair switches or leds are messed up" posts than I do about ducky
I know that I want to get a graded set of ASEs as my dad took me every weekend when I was a kid to get one of them until I had a whole set. Then my uncle stole them and sold them for meth money. Other than those I don't think I'll get into any graded stuff
like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/gun46FH.jpg)?
have any pictures? price info?
You beat me to it

Bought an artisan from /u/icedogg9999
Imgur is too confused to be a dickhead
There was a guy considering selling his on the /r/mechmarket price check thread a few days ago. Dunno if he decided to sell or not, just letting you know.
Sorry for the misleading title then, I just thought it was accurate for something that's almost 20 years old. Didn't know it had to do with how it functions
This is after cleaning up
Thanks! It's my version of end game, and the switches feel amazing. Thanks for the kind words!
I am almost certain that something you enjoy is deemed not necessary or overrated by others, but you enjoy it, and that is all that matters.
lol wasnt trying to give my resumé, just a concise explanation. but thanks!
Yeah I love it. I just built my clueboard though and it's a bit quieter, so time for the beast to find a loving home
What a cock
That's a lot of dedication and man hours. Nice album
thanks!\n
Yeah I understand. Especially the case options. I've found that people either love or hate the acrylic case. I happen to love it, but if you don't there aren't a whole lot of options. 
Did you make your plate yourself or I'd there somewhere you can get one with that layout?
a.k.a. wife's loud-ass source of hatred
Confirmed
Local one in Alabama. They always have a ton of keyboards
There is a black aluminum middle plate and bottom plate with the white acrylic top. I built it about a year ago, so their inventory could have changed.
If there was one for the outside to be confused on it's this one lol
it is bolted in four spots to the desk it is sitting on. If someone wanted it bad enough, they could get it, but they are going to make some noise. Most of what's in it is just stuff no one would want but that id prefer survive a fire.
Yeah, it will fit that case, and also, I believe the clueboard shop itself is supposed to have the aluminum cases in stock this month as well
so super helpful thank you so much I got it now!
I don't care for how it feels
I could, but this one had everything from three years of college when I bought the laptop, and it was just easier to have two. Plus I like having the laptop in bed.
I'm just in the process of putting a set together. I only have three so far, but I thought I'd just put it out there that I'm looking for them in case anyone was looking to sell. I don't think I'd be in the market for a 20 thousand dollar coin, just putting a graded set together as a hobby
Thanks! That whole comment thread is a useful resource, as I have never messed with leds or anything. Hopefully wiring that strip in isn't too hard.
Sweet thanks for the reply. I want to get some experience hand wiring and I love that layout with the layer for the num pad.
Thanks to /u/skullydazed for the tips during the process. Thanks to wasd for the caps and excellent customer service and thanks to /u/90n1ne for the hopefully inbound cable.
Just a joke about the "I came" title
So I'm guessing that's an endorsement for the satan. What are the case options for it? If you have any advice
sold dell model m to /u/kamegami
I have gateron greens from the most recent resupply at 1up keyboards in my clueboard and I've had no issues with them.
/u/tehpanduh was looking for something along these lines
First time building a board and first time doing a build log, so be kind. Built with gateron greens with WASD brand poor man stormtrooper keycaps. Penguin build, like a chicken in a tuxedo.
I ordered from wasd because I wanted an exact color scheme for my clueboard, otherwise I would have gone with pbt. How long did they take to get the caps to you from wasd?
Nice
Not the first one
you buy the pcb and acrylic (or aluminum when they are in stock) case and stabilizers as three separate items iirc. You can also order switches but I already had ordered mine (gateron greens) from 1upkeyboards.com. The acylic case (what I have) comes with all the necessary parts you need to put it together (my screws were sent separately due to a shipping error but the customer service from /u/skullydazed was second to none). I got my cable from /u/90n1ne. I love it, and it is my version of endgame. Endless customizability and putting it together is super simple. I made a small build log [here] (http://imgur.com/a/cVwFS). Any other questions just ask, I can't recommend it enough.

I'm married. I spent 6 years in the US Army, and now I am going to school, so this is in my apartment, just off of campus
Glad my guide was helpful!
Double it, because you can make a call and smell a fart with it too
Ordered the from wasd keyboards. Excellent customer service over there, and I'm happy with the caps

Happy I could help
This was truly enjoyable to read
It's strange how different people's taste in switches are over such small differences in force. To each his or her own i spose
I only have one board worth of soldering iron hunching so far, but I can only imagine. Again, nice work

[Also] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/4hj85b/ajazz_ak33_superbudget_70_keyboard_review/) an option.
Also, just to be clear, all of those parts (PCB case and stabs) are bought fom the shop.clueboard.co website
Thanks, forgot!

Be careful buying from them. I sent them an email like a month and a half ago and got no response, and there was someone recently saying they ordered, waiting a long time then just had their money refunded with no explanation. I'm not saying not to pursue it, just be thorough and let us know your experience.

Am American. Can confirm
That's cool! They are easy to build, but I understand not everyone wants to. Thanks for the kind words about my build log.
Thanks! It was really fun making it.
Totally agree
Yeah apparently they're just old. Updated post accordingly
Yeah the color of the cherry mx doesn't matter, those will fit any type of cherry mx switch
Thanks man! I know what you mean. I can appreciate the magazine cover looking setups, but mine is hardly ever that clean
Nice thanks!
Shop.clueboard.co has an option for having them build it for you. You'd have to buy gat blues and send it to them, then you'd wait for it to be built and they would send it out to you. Or you could get the switches and order the pcb and case and assemble it yourself. I believe those are your options with clueboard but /u/skullydazed correct me if I'm wrong on any part of that.
So the basic idea is just get what you like, because silver is silver?
Word
I just finished my clueboard with gateron greens. I feel your joy
Pm'd
I actually think I can answer my own question. Looking at other build logs it looks like most people have a 1u cap on the right side of the bottom row and all of the ducky caps are 1.5u caps or whatever on the bottom row. It would be nice to get some confirmation though!
Weird, with my board the space bar doesn't fit if switched

I was looking at the gh60. Any budget one you'd recommend?
Lol that is classic

is that what that white is on it?\n
Thanks and I'm glad that my documentation of this process has helped the community in some way. Thanks again for the help along the way.
that's what I was looking at through amazon, but I wanted to see if I got anything interesting here. thanks though!
I changed it up a little so I now have the standard row with the 1u alt on the left. But yeah it was that 1u that was throwing me off. Thanks for the response!
Corsair is not very popular around here for being overpriced and not having a bottom row. Good boards for around that price are ducky, Pok3r, masterkeys pro boards
I was about plat on console. Got placed high sliver at about lvl 29, pushed to mid gold playing dps and healer
Thanks
Just what I was thinking lol good luck 
An Anne Pro would be a good choose 
Why would you say it's not worth the effort, and how long do they take to build?
I have a budget of 120$ and have narrowed down my search to the cm storm rgb and the iKbc rgb, both have brown switches available. Thanks for the help
I use a TKL and I like it. I think I will be getting the iKbc one 
Are there any pre built boards with zealios or mx clears that (I know the WASD board has clears but I don't want to pay that much just to get them)
Any links to these? Nice pics
Lol, guess I'm sliver for a reason, using em 60g blues up here
[here](http://m.ebay.com/itm/PFU-PD-KB400B-Happy-Hacking-Keyboard-Professional2-Dark-Grey-/292032864810?hash=item43fe83e22a%3Ag%3AGbYAAOSwCU1Yqdeg&_trkparms=pageci%253Ad6e3d590-f787-11e6-8d27-74dbd180f6a1%257Cparentrq%253A5c4ebac015a0a2a3986f69a7fff2c10e%257Ciid%253A11) 
Can anyone explain why this is 60 dollars for a rubber dome?
Ok
How do you test the pcb?
Ok thanks
Why would someone handwire, it looks much harder than soldering the pcb noob here
Kinda new here. How are zealios like? 
I have a Lingbao Jis something, I got it for 40 dollars on amazon. You'll have the choice of black or blue switches, black vein heavy and linear blues being loud and tactile (very loud). The board has six or so lighting modes (non customizable rainbow colors.) the board isn't great but for the price, a pretty good tlk board 
How do the browns feel? Nice board btw
The size of the space bar and I think the alt key are not a standard size 
I looked on the site but I couldn't really understand how I would do it 
Hmm, I have never tried torpe but why do you think it is bad for gaming?
Sorry but what are ergoclears?
Do you need to sand the caps for this to work? Or does that just effect he texture?
Is the GH60 build on aliexpress good for a first timer?
'Pick me'
[This](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01M1GLOU9/ref=cm_cr_arp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8) is the exact board, I want rgb, a board that will last and is compatible with keycaps (standard layout), also ANSI. I have not felt these switches but I have a cheap Chinese board with blue switches and want something less distracting for gaming and still good for typing. Thanks
Look great! Link please
Stupid question, but what is GMK?
Ok
Wait, the keycaps are 80 usd?
So you can send like one artisan and you can receive something like this?
I would get a switch tester
Thank you :) [volcanoooooo](http://m.imgur.com/UPbIRHe) 
Hey it's me your friend
Ok thanks
Ah, I'm sure a silver like me won't mind 
I meant an rx 480
Ah, thanks. When I build a board, probably soon, I'll get zeals I guess
?
Cool
I known there are 1976 caps in aliexpress but just OEM profile 
I think you might be at the one near me. Lol
I know that gatoron switches are considered better, essentially for browns. But what is wrong with cherry browns, I've heard one person say they are like reds with a grain of rice in it
Which would you recommend?
Thanks for the giveaway!
Mx clears right?

I would look into a better power supply when possible. Otherwise nice build
Which tester is this?
Thanks, helps a lot
Cherry brown vs gateron brown?                         Gateron brown vs cherry clear?
Sorry for being off topic, but is streaming with a 6100 impossible (480) graphics
I know these all have great rgb but I'm not sure about programmability 
I will be ordering off amazon so I can return if needed
Just gonna warn you that this keyboard is overpriced and has pretty mushy switches and there are no keycap sets that fit the switches. A better choice would be a ducky or cooler master and buy a aftermarket wrist wrest. Just my opinion have fun
Thank you
I actually think most use Razor boards because of sponsorships
What caps are on your board (not the artisan)
Could you compare the clears to a blue or more to a brown?
Those caps loon sweet! Link?
I gotchu fam

Why would one need more than one torpe board??
My board with outemu blues are waking up my family. I am looking for a quiet switch that still has a nice tactile bump. I saw the mx clear switch but that might be too heavy for me since I will be mostly gaming. I saw the Zealio switches but they are a bit too expensive for me
I have seen that people say not to cheap out on the ps 
Thanks
That feeling when a 4-6 key board is more expensive than your daily driver

On the site it has a lot of different kits. Which one did you get and how are they different?
I actually happen to own this board with blue switches. And yes they echo around my whole house. The board is fine for the price, the lighting is an ugly rainbow.
This helped me to

Reper main for life
Thanks for the reply

I meant the master keys on the first comment. Are the lighting on the masterkeys very customizable though?
The Teamwolf Zque is unique because you can pop out the switches without soldering. I think I also spelled that wrong
Then a 750w will be fine, it will allow more than enough overhead to overclock your CPU and GPU and still allow room for future upgrades. The build should be good for 1440p gaming, on a few graphically intense games you might need to tweak a few settings to ensure you stay above 60fps, but for the most part it looks like it will do exactly what you want it to do.
Try reseating the RAM and GPU? Also make sure you have the CPU cooler fan header plugged in all the way on your motherboard?
Because it was a discord meme with griffity
I don't know if my heart can take another delayed shipping email. I ordered an otterbox the same day I ordered the phone and I have just been holding the empty case dreaming of the day it arrives.
Are you planning on overclocking? What is your target resolution/fps?
Personally I would ditch the Z170 motherboard for a regular one. The 6500 stands great on it's own and I've used it two builds this year. With the motherboard savings I would step up the 1060 6Gb.
You don't need that USB wifi adapter. Your motherboard has built in dual band wifi. You'll save $30 and free up a USB port ;) I also agree that your chosen power supply is overkill for this build
(forgot to answer your question) Personally I think inner bicep looks pretty good for a first tattoo.
I ordered mine from Verizon on the 10/18 too and had the same expected ship date. Last night around 6pm (central time) i got the email that mine isn't expected to ship until 11/26!
I strongly believe that if his budget allows it, two channel from the get go is better than a single channel set up. But if the budget is that tight, single channel now with a clear upgrade in the future to dual channel is a good option
I did the same thing with my first build 4 years ago and I haven't had any issues. I just played classic games that didn't require much horsepower until I was able to buy the gpu I wanted
With the savings from moving to a non K chip I would consider the following: \n\nstep up to a GTX 1060. \n\nadd in a second stick of RAM\n\nUpgrade to a larger SSD or add a storage 1TB HHD since 120gb isn't that much space\n\nI would say up the GPU now if you can, the other two items I suggested could be addressed as you run out of space or if you feel like you need more RAM.
Solid survey, I hope enough people take it to give you a decent sample size!
I don't use Adobe products and I saw that Adobe recomends 3GB of RAM for Illustrator so I thought 8GB would be sufficient. But it would probably be for the best to just set her up with a 16gb kit and not have to worry about adding a second dim in the future.\n\nThank you for the suggestion!
QB 128gb XL\n\nOrder placed with verizon on 10/18. Expected ship date 11/11 (today). Still stuck at processing. Hopefully it goes out today but with so many people seeing ship dates pushed out into December, I'm not holding out any hope that I'll get it this month.\n\nUpdate:\nGot the email that my new expected ship date is the 26th.
Thanks, and that's rough! When did you order?
I thought about doing the same but I wouldn't want to cut down on my music library :/ But if the less storage isn't an issue it would probably be worth it to switch to a 32gb and get that sweet, sweet instant gratification 
When I logged into my verizon today to check the order, it no longer has any details about the order listed. The status of the order is blank and it removed the wording about how the device is back ordered and that I should check my email. Hopefully this means they are making moves on the order and not that it is getting pushed back again...\n\nHaven't received any emails yet on which way it's going.
Solid build but I wouldn't get a single stick of RAM instead get a 2x8 or a 2x4 kit. It would yield better performance than single channel memory
My ship date was moved to 12/26 but I got my phone 3 days ago! They didn't send me any updates saying it was shipping but my store called and let me know it was in. 
No issues on my XL running 7.1.1
They might be but I wouldn't order them from that site. I picked up some new reds a few weeks ago from mechanicalkeyboards.com and they are great.
I ordered mine on October 18th and I had my shipping date delayed 2 weeks. The updated shipping day has come and gone without any updates from Verizon. I wouldn't be surprised if I don't get it until 2017 the way things have been shaping up...
Rough, I'm still waiting on my XL to ship but I already have my otterbox in hand for the moment it arrives!
Shit, I didn't realize you had a Note 7! Does your Verizon have a loaner phone you can use until the Pixel arrives so you don't have to worry about that bad boy blowing up?
Any updates on your phone? I had the same exact phone and order date and I got the same email on 11/11 saying it would be delayed until 11/26. As 11/26 comes to a close my order is still in processing and I haven't received any emails.
I haven't called them yet since I figured nothing would get done over the long holiday weekend. I'll call on Monday if I don't see any movement on my order. Hopefully all of this delayed shit doesn't affect the process for claiming that free daydream headset, I think the deadline on that promotion is 12/31 :/

It's a bad deal. You can get that laptop for $900 refurbished or for $950 as an open box special on Newegg...For ~1300 you could get a better laptop
Pow, right in the childhood! I can't wait to use these in game
You should be able to get 60fps at high/ultra settings. But you bought an overclockable K chip and a motherboard that doesn't support overclocking. If you aren't planning on overclocking it's not a huge deal, it just means you overpaid on the CPU. If you were hoping to overclock, you'll need a different Z series motherboard that allows for overclocking to get the full potential out of the CPU you have
Change the 6600k out for a 6500.
Assuming you are planning on playing at 1080p you shouldn't have any issues. If you are playing at a bigger resolution than that, it may depend on the game as far as staying above 144fps goes. It will depend on what games you play.\n\nI have a gtx1080 and I play in surround at 5760x1080 and if I play graphically intense games I get about 40-60fps (high settings).
The update just became available for me as well (USA)
Head over to their discord server: https://discordapp.com/invite/gamesdonequick
Sorry to hear it, but the OnePlus 3t is a fantastic device! I would also cancel my pixel order and go for the 3t if I wasn't stuck with Verizon through my work. It would be so much simpler if the 3t worked on verizon's network :/
Salt.
Perhaps your CPU fan cord isn't fully plugged into the CPU fan header on your motherboard?
I just did I micro-atx build for a friend and I really liked the Corsair carbide 88r that she picked out
When I checked "My Orders" online today, the status of my order is blank (previously said "processing") and the shipping date/the wording about how the device is back ordered and I should check my email are no longer there. Hopefully that means they are making moves on the order and not pushing it out further...
I use the MSI GS60 Ghost Pro for my ableton needs. It's thin, light, and very powerful. I don't need dongles and I love it. Prior to this laptop I was using a 2009 Mac book pro which was good until it started to slow down last year.\n\nIf I was invested in the Apple ecosystem I probably would have given more thought to another Mac book for my music needs
From that NewEgg spec sheet it looks like it has 3 Molex plugs
I'm assuming it is just going to be updated to reflect the email from last week showing the new delayed ship date but I can't help but hope something more is happening lol
2x the theoretical performance. In the real world it isn't that big of a difference but having two allows more action to happen simultaneously. However, a single stick does allow a better upgrade path. Personally I wouldn't do single channel in my rig but if your budget doesn't allow for a dual channel set up a single stick now and just ordering a second one down the road isn't a bad option 
It's understandable, I am just excited to get the phone since my Note 4 is on it's last limb. (Battery doesn't hold charge well and my back button presses itself randomly making it hard to do anything lol)\n\nThank you for the suggestion of calling though! The guy that manages my company plan was in and he's going to keep checking on it throughout the week and text me with updates, which means I won't be driving myself mad refreshing the order page lol
Haven't had any issues with my audio yet
If it were my build I would ditch the SLI. SLI scaling isn't great for non VR action so I would upgrade to an i7 and get a gtx1080. That way you save enough by only buying 1 card that the headset will fit nicer in the budget. I can put together a part picker list when I get home
Great work, from the thumbnail I thought this was from r/fallout!
Had the same thing happen to mine the other day. I noticed the info disappeared after I received an email stating that my ship date was being pushed out 2 weeks. Still haven't seen any updates online or via email...\n\n\nUpdate 11/18: I checked online today and they had the order listed as processing again, still expected to ship on 11/26
Glad someone was able to get some use out of it!
Ordered my 128gb XL on 10/18\n\nOriginal ship date: 11/11\n\nUpdated ship date: 11/26\n\nNewly updated ship date:12/26\n\nIf it gets delayed again I'll probably just cancel my order and wait to see what the S8 will bring to the table. If the S8 is unappealing hopefully by then they'll finally have pixel xls in stock lol\n\n*my phone is through my work and I don't have the option to buy the pixel through the Google store or Fi, unfortunately :/
Yikes! I ordered mine a couple days before launch and I got mine in mid December. Was definitely worth the wait for the color/storage size I wanted.
By getting after market springs 
My second estimated shipping date of 11/26 has come and gone without any contact from verizon and the online portal still says processing. So today I sent a text to our rep that manages my company's account asking if he had any insider scoop on shipping dates. He is out of the office today but will see what he can dig up on the status of backordered XLs tomorrow. \n\nHe also let me know that he will fight to make sure I still get the free daydream headset if there any issues with missing window for redeeming the free vr headset.\n\nSo even though I'm upset by the delay, it's good to know our rep will make sure I can still redeem the free headset. We have a very good relationship with him, since he's been managing our account for a long time. Hopefully anyone else that misses the redemption window has helpful reps at their store!
It is what it is, luckily my phone is taken care of through my work and my boss is good friends with our verizon rep so if it does affect the free daydream we should be able to work something out with the store. I'm coming from a Samsung (note 4, i wanted the note 7 but then that whole fire thing changed my mind pretty quick) so I would be more inclined to look at the OnePlus 3t. But for now I'll keep holding out for the pixel xl and hope that it's everything I want it to be

That ASROCK board has 4 ddr3 1600 slots. Although wouldn't you want the Fatal1ty Z97 since you have an overclockable CPU? If you don't care about overclocking it's fine but you won't be maximizing the potential of that i7
Are you planning on overclocking? If not, I would drop the K CPU for a regular i5 and buy a 500w PSU with a better 80+ rating
I like MSI, I have had a 780ti from them that has worked flawlessly for the last 3.5 years
Well that's a pretty sweet deal! I'll live vicariously through you while I sit here on my verizon throne of disapointment lol
I'm excited for you, have fun with the build!
Thanks! That helps a lot, now I just need to get better at getting consistent with my movements. I spend a solid minute bashing my head against the edge of the elevator door lol.
Newegg.ca ?
Just checked in with the store and they still have the order but no movement on the device. They still show an 11/26 ship date but told me it's still in the processing phase and didn't know when it would ship out due to hefty backorder.
These look great, I can't wait to try them out if my phone ever ships lol
I will be sure to check them out.

Im heading into a store tomorrow

Once you know your switch type and budget - perhaps something like a magicforce68 or cooler master rapid fire or master keys pro would work for you. 
Ill be sure to have a look at them
Kinda sad I missed out on the M65 as it looked peng
assuming i still use it

If they brought back this screen it would be cool if the operators were animated on this screen like they are at the end of the round, except without the taunt for elite operators of course.\n
Ok thats good I was hoping this was the case seeing as those are not very cheap camos
I think the refund idea is a good one, personally I have 5 universal camos from season 1 and I don't think I will refund any of them but I do think the option should be there for those who want to go that path.
I have seen multiple clips similar to this on this subreddit and for whatever reason in every one of the clips fuze is outside one of the kids bedroom windows
Thank you for the help, i forgot to mention the cooler might be getting changed.
Adding more ranks would make me look like Im a much better player being on the bottom row in platinum 2
A good list as I didn't know about the capitao one even as a capitao main I just didn't think of it. But for the one about blitz flashing it I honestly think with the state blitz is In right now a flashing would be a lot better because you don't have to get right up close.
A blitz tried to flank me today whilst I was in a gunfight with sledge I just spun around and shot about half my mag at the middle of his shield and got him.
Made me laugh, only just yesterday in casual I saw 5 recruits with shields being a moving wall.\n
weird 
Thanks for putting your time and effort into this with your friend you guys did a very good job and i found it really cool.
agreed
Well I'm on PS4 and my charms are working fine maybe try closing the application and starting it up again.
I think I will have to try IQ out again the last time I tried her was a month or so ago and I did not like playing as IQ one bit, but with the new buff i might have to try her out again.
True I was playing with a full squad recently and we had 2 guys who would play the first round and then disconnect, they would then reconnect and just be on cams the whole round then they would do the drone phase. Then run about 20 metres out of spawn and get disconnected again only to repeat the process. 
Please tell me that is the worst potato of your life and a new sensitivity. It seemed like a new sensitivity just by looking at some of your gun movement with the mpx
damn unlucky man
At least he/she does not nibble your charging cables.
I see where you are heading with this but at the same time it seems fine as it is in my opinion \n
Yes a IQ buff was needed I am most likely just a bit butthurt being so used to those grenades.
Not quite sure what python I am learning but Im learning from a site called codecademy
I feel your pain bro Im on PS4 and every time I enter platinum I will win a few games and then get destroyed by mouse players for a bit.
I loved the high noon in the chat\n
Lovely I wish in ranked I had montagnes this good 
Indeed that deters him from me and I also find his DMR absolute garbage.
I honestly think its a good thing to be in the game it gives you a chance to at least try get away. And with most players including myself depending on the situation it puts me on edge.
Looks dope but picture is horizontal for me is that intentional?
I try my best ;)
Thanks! This build is very helpful also thank you for that windows advice ill be sure to use that.
I believe that ones called the mating seal
Fair enough
Why does this remind me off the grinch, maybe its the creepy smile and the christmas decorations in the background but theres just something about it.
I remember when twitch looked like that and it would always be a bit funny to see someone pick twitch and her face would always look  like that.
It was meant to be a joke maybe I should work on the execution
I agree strongly I am stuck for many hours at a time with no challenge to help me get that little bit extra renown, mind you I personally do not need it as I play quite a lot but for the players who are not as active I think the challenges are a good way to get renown.\n\n
Interesting only one person has thrown a flash at me whilst I was looking through the mirror and it fully flashed me so I just assumed that it was consistent thing. Haha I though I was flashing people in ranked when I threw my flash in front of the mirror, I guess that will make me think twice thanks for that info.
To be fair console (PS4 at least) has a fair bit of team killing as well. for example just yesterday I was playing casual and I picked Caviera another player just killed me as soon as I spawned in and then messaged me "my caviera" (in all caps). The annoying thing is he had a mic aswell and could have simply just asked me to switch and I would have happily done so.
Yeah I was in a ranked game a while back and it was a 2v5 I was telling the guy we needed to get on the objective (kitchen on cafe) and atleast try get some cover and then take try let them come to us. The guy said "No point we are just gonna die and my ranked KD will go down". So I had to go in the objective solo whilst he was across the map, I needed up getting 3 of them but was caught out by a fourth while I was reloading. I really needed him with me to help out on those last guys as well. Keep in mind this was 2 seasons ago towards the end of skull rain. And I have not seen it since but I'm sure it still happens.
This would be helpful for when I am playing with randoms as I don't really take the time to look at their names and which OP they have chosen, where is with my friends we all have our mains and we generally know who we are gonna play which route we might take ect, and if we do try something different to usual we will call it out.
I'm surprised that I don't see more about this board on the sub honestly.  May just because it hasn't been out that long I guess I don't know.
My g403 is a 1633, the scroll wheel is loose but the side buttons are fine. I haven't heard about squeaky side buttons before, what batch is your g403?
As a Capitao main my opinion is definitely bias but I still want my say. I agree with this 100% when they took away his grenades I was annoyed but I also understand that those made him a little too good. But breaching charges would be great with him putting down your breach charge and then pulling out your bow, a teammate gives you info about the guy on the other side of the wall you pre aim blow the wall oped shoot your bow and take them out. Also it could be a great if you put down a smoke then exploded it allowing the enemy to not know your location only for you to fire at corners with your fire arrows. ahh glorious I probably went off on a tangent but just know I love capitao.
By the way if you wouldn't mind answering I was wondering whether you could tell. For the case I have chosen I can not tell from this web page showcasing it whether a case fan is included or not.\n\nhttps://www.nzxt.com/products/s340-black-red
I see will post over there sorry I should have read the sidebar.
Well done 
Thank you for the help Ill definitely switch keyboards then Im heading to the mechanical sub reddit now.\n
its just a prank
Wow recently I have seen so many cool drawings on this sub reddit\n
Well said but 50% would be to much in my opinion i think maybe something like 25% that way we still wouldn't be getting a free booster basically 
I really liked those especially bucks that line would work so well. With Bucks though I think he should be picking his weapon of a bench and then have it in his hands, then the life has many doors line and after that he should cock the skeleton key then cut to black.
I love how the cat grabs the mouse... HAH no one? Ill see myself out I guess.
That happened to me yesterday and I'm playing on PS4 and the way I fixed it is by just closing the application. And if that docent work I would just try turning of your platform and then turning it back on.
I agree this was just a joke post
Wow thats really good\n
I made a recent post about a similar topic I'm glad to see that I'm not the only feeling this pain, they need to do something.
That does not happen to me but I am curios about whats happening there could you maybe explain it to me.
Haha I would have used elephant as well when I started out but I couldn't even figure out how to get it.
see stuff like that is just the worst\n
Today I was in a gunfight only to hear gunshots behind me so I turned and aimed and shot directly in the middle of the blitz's shield (I didn't realise it was a shield operator until I shot) and I killed the guy just straight up even though I aimed at his shield.
Yeah today I heard a lot more about this keyboard from friends that purchased it and they said that they found it to be very easily brake able and that It wasn't worth the price.\n\nI will take a look at risen thanks for the tip and I have had a bad experience with outlet PC as well so I want going to purchase from them.\n\n,Thanks
As a PS4 player i appreciate the prayers but also makes me feel bad for not having my pc set up yet.
lol fair enough did you not see the misleading title flair though?
Im not new but I'm happy to help out psn is Trickeey-
Please tell me the use of elephant camo is only because this is a very old clip and you didn't know any better back then.
yep gg
Yeah, it's 45g too.
Isn't this the same keyboard as the 87U essentially?
55g is more like 70g so that might be better.
Leopold 980C?
There are alot of posts on that board, it's just the hype has died down. 
55g is quite a bit heavier and you might prefer it over 45g.
A sound only 4 cylinders can make mmmmm
Are you sure its the lens and not the scroll wheel.
Are yours slightly offset? My sliders are slightly rotated to the left.
Razer nostromo had pretty nice rubber domes.
Yeah I'm planning to do that when Hyperglide release some g403 feet.
Slightly heavier but far lighter than any zowie.
I own one and used to own a deathadder. The shape is very nice for claw grip and I much prefer it over the curvier deathadder shape which I don't like.
If you aren't playing FPS I'd personally get the g700s.
Probably pad printed or something.
Just keep using it and you'll get used to it. I noticed it at first but I got over it in a day or two.
Reviewers usually don't go into long term for their reviews. Might work fine for the first few months, it breaks, and then we deal with it when people come here for help.
Deathadder for larger hands.
Get a g403 or the deathadder
People don't like the short travel or don't realise it's supposed to be a short travel switch. Some people says its mushy, but If you like it that's fine.
Nixeus Revel's shape is basically a upscaled Kinzu. Or you could get the Zowie ZA (3 sizes) or the Zowie FK (also 3 sizes)
You could also try the paper tape silencing mod and lubing it. I've heard landing pads are inconsistent. 
From what I've heard is they are very springy in sound and maybe inconsistent. Just look up a Das 4c review.
QCK+ or the limited version if you can find one.
G900 is pretty much the lightest gaming mouse with a free scroll.
Mamba for looks, Elite for performance. The differences in performance is the Elite has a much better sensor.
I've heard the quality was better and personally I've felt they've gotten a bit more consistent. I remembered the first gen Razer switches had really shit clicks while the newer ones are better. If you do end up returning your keyboard, I think it would just be better to get a keyboard with cherry switches.\n\nAlso the switch rating is usually a load of shit.
Dunno about that, the rubber is a massive thick chunk that feels like its built directly into the mouse rather than some grip glued on.
The spacebar on my MX clear board with cherry stabs gets stuck quite a lot.
I remember them saying they wanted to keep a good relation with Topre so probably not.
Probably the G900 or the G502. Both have pretty heavily built metal scrolls wheels. Not sure if they will survive your rage, but you probably can't get anything better.
Regardless if its fwd or rwd, it's on four wheels and still needs rear traction.
Logitech g403?
Yeah, you can't get clicky scroll wheels on gaming mice. Best I can think of is g502. The scroll steps are pretty massive which I like.
Yes it is.
No need to downvote the dude.
Logitech m720 triathlon 
For me lube has worked wonders except for stabilizers which I put a bit too much. Spacebar no longer rattles which is good.
Well you should edit the post because it looks like you are asking for an expensive mouse. As for the mouse why don't you just get the same mouse again? All the mice that are that small are usually cheap.
I think it's a known issue for the Ducky One.
Other than a louder than normal clack sound, I don't see how the typeheaven is different. I used to own one but bought a realforce for the 55g and PBT keycaps. I'd say the typeheaven is built better than a realforce.
But do those gaming boards have super special adjustable actuation points for 10x higher APM and patented Topre soft BottomOuT^tm technology for 2x finger stamina? I don't think so.
Apparently there might be a successor to the s2k, I hope they keep it NA. There's also the s1000 soon which is a s660 thats more suited for markets outside of Japan.
The g602 isn't known for its reliability, my friend is on his 3rd g602. All three developed a broken scroll wheel. If you want to casually game and save some money, get the g602. The g403 wireless is pretty much ready for competitive gaming.
Is that a realforce?
Pretty nice but I think it would look better with slightly thicker side walls on the tyres and less flat headlights
The button issue is pretty common with all mice. You could try returning it.
Nope, don't get it. The philips sensor sucks ass when you can get a mouse with a 3360 for the same price or lower.
1) Remove and the keycaps and unclip the case (There should be 4 clips on the bottom of the case)\n\n2) Unplug and unscrew the cable from the PCB\n\n3) Flip over and unscrew everything on the PCB, be careful because you could knock off some component. Happened to me and was lucky it only fucked up the indicator leds.\n\n4) Separate the plate from the PCB and be careful to not lose some springs as some of the rubber domes might unstick and fall out.\n\n5) Remove the sliders by using a screw driver or anything pointy by applying pressure until it pops out. There will be a bit of shredded plastic and it's very loud when you remove the sliders.\n\nYour keyboard should be ready to be lubed, make sure to not put too much lube to the point where it's dripping. Too much will make it sticky and potentially less snappy. Also from my experience the keyboard will be very quiet for a few days before getting a bit louder.
Logitech G700. The g700s version has a better coating but looks more gamery. Gaming performance should be better than a MX Master and its much cheaper since it's an older mouse. It will game pretty well but not as well as some other mice in FPS.
A cheap ae86. heh
G403 wireless is pretty good. If you don't mind extra weight and don't really play fps, the g700/s is also pretty nice. I'd still be using mine if it hadn't got stolen. The g700 pretty much looks like an office mouse. The S version is a newer one with some hydrophobic coating, pretty nice but has a more gamery look.
It seemed fine for me but I felt it was easier when I switched to a logitech.
You won't regret it.
Mines 1 usb cable. It's probably meant to be mainly used for flash drives or something.
I'd get the speed. I personally hate the control; It feels too rough.
Mine had the sticker seals and still has a rattly scroll. Doesn't really bother me that much. I would return mine but I'm afraid I might get one with uneven sounding clicks.
Are you familiar with the different switch types?
Blues are clicky in sound like a mouse and have a tactile bump that indicates when the switch has been activated. Browns are quieter and have no click while also having a tactile bump. \n\nBlacks and Reds are linear and smooth throughout the switch and have no tactile bump.\n\nHere is a picture of the force curves: https://i.imgur.com/i9U0BKJ.png\n\nSo in short: \n\nBlues: Clicky and tactile\n\nBrowns: Quiet and tactile\n\nReds: Quiet and linear\n\nBlacks: Quiet, linear and also slightly heavier in force than reds.
 i made the same mistake as you and bought a 3.2 ages ago. I think getting the 3 series of teensys are way harder to get working than just buying a teensy 2.0
Not sure about in the US but in Australia the IKBC f108 was on sale for like $129 aud which is equivalent to $104 usd.
Just to make sure. http://imgur.com/a/jnsNe
Wouldn't remove the click, only the clack.
[Are you the glitch?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXj_GDktXaA)
Logitech m337. You are asking for an expensive mouse and most expensive mice are "complex"
Logitech M720 is pretty good, works with bluetooth and size wise is in between the Master and the anywhere.
That's what the rival 700 is for.
PCcasegear has the Ducky Zero in blue switches (other switches are out of stock) for $109\n\nMwave has the Cherry mx 2.0 in brown switches for $85 and the Cougar Attack 2 with black switches for $89\n\nThese three are full size and have cherry switches. The Z and the Blackwidow use Chinese switches that are generally lower quality.
TOPRE TOPRE TOPRE
Without weights and without weight cover for me. #weightreduction
It's possible that the old batch still hasn't been cycled out. I bought my G403 in November but it was built on the 33rd week which is around August. My friend's one was built on the 39th week, which is September and was bought in early January. His has no problems.
We need red pocket modifiers.
I've never had problems with my 403 wireless. Usually when my usb devices disconnect randomly, its when its plugged into the front of my desktop.
Is it an RGB model? And if so, are you plugging it into the usb 3.0 port?
Try go to a store and try out the different switches.
You could mod the switches otherwise nothing is that much quieter.
If your pok3r is ANSI (US layout) it should be fine as basically all cherry keysets were made for ANSI.
I haven't measured my hands yet but what I don't like about the deathadder is the shape is very curvy while the g403 still has curves but is less pronounced. I'm mainly a claw/fingertip grip and the deathadder kinda is more on the palmgrip type while the g403 has a steeper hump which feels better for claw. \n\nThey are both very nice mice and you should choose one over the other for their shapes.\n\nCheck out rocket jump ninja on youtube. He has pretty much everything you want to know about using the mice.
Only silent mouse I know of is a non-gaming logitech silent mouse. Sorry to say, but there is basically ZERO silent gaming mice. Only way is to modify the mouse which isn't really an option for you. Maybe one day companies will sell mice with different switches like mechanical keyboards.
Ec-2 is an ergonomic right hand design while the fk is a flat ambidextrous shape.
please don't remind me.
Replacement keycaps for non-standard bottom row tend be more expensive and not backlit. Most good keycap sets usually come with extra keys that fit the non-standard keys, non-standard spacebar tends to be rarer. \n\nTBH people are really anal about the bottom row considering a lot of enthusiast boards use even rarer layouts than corsair and razer, and you still see them loaded with custom keycap sets.\n\nTLDR: Actual good keycap sets will usually fit the corsair, albeit expensive.
Difference in feel? I don't think so. Even if its different manufacturers, the specs and the design should be the same.
I have a g302 which I would assume the buttons are the same, but I prefer the g403's longer travel that has some slack for your fingers. Don't like the short and hard bottom out clicks of the g302.
Looks like a very short travel membrane. I have a feeling you would like Topre, ALPs or romer-g.
I don't really notice it so I'm fine. 
It's good for gaming but don't expect mad flick shots.
I'd say the g700s is closer to the MX Master. Plus the free scroll is so good.
Modern Beige, its sold on Originative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBFhjIOeTiA This is a comparison of all the zowie shapes.
Should be fine. If you add too much stuff to the hub it definitely will affect it. I've got my keyboard and mouse on a hub and as soon as I add one more thing, the mouse tracking goes funny and the keyboard types other letters.
Probably
maybe we should have a car suggestion post.
Mine are pretty similar are but this is an issue for all mice. Maybe one day companies will sort the switches into ones that are similar.
I replicated the noise but it took quite a few tries for me. I really had to press really hard and get my thumb to stick on and then release it quickly.
Yeah I know, but he wanted something shaped like a MX Master. I have a g403 and its shaped nothing like the master.
I've only had it for about 2 months and the only wear I see is the place wear I grip the mouse has lost its texture and smoothed out a bit. It should be fine, the rubber is very thick.
No but you can put in topre to mx sliders. I think it should be fine except for the spacebar and the stabilized keys. You'll have to 3d print the stabilized sliders. 
Mechkb is pretty much the only place in Australia that stocks Topre. You'll have to wait.
Corsair K60
Hope the phys is realistic or has an option for it. I think thats the reason most people came to dirt rally.
The switches in the MX series and the ducky mouse are not more mechanical than any other mouse.
Logitech m90 :) Super loud.
Probably something wrong with yours then. I spam the side buttons in mmos heaps and never notice it. None of my friend's g403s have the problem either. I think the noise is in all g403s, but some are more prone to it.
I've been on their keyboard product page a lot very recently with the re-release of the novatouch and cnc norbauer case and didn't see it until this evening.
live in. 3-10 years I suppose.
In.\n\nI hope I am quick enough!
I am tired and can't figure out what you are asking lol.\n\nThere is a dedicated Q&A section on winkey's website he is very helpful.  [check it out](http://winkeyless.kr/forums/forum/qna/)
Well now that I've seen this I will never own an endgame board because I'll always feel like a peasant.\n\nThat is fucking dope.
That makes sense.  I will find a proxy and have them ask the seller if it would be possible.  I really appreciate your help maybe I'll end up with my end game here :)
Lmao great shot
Thank you very much.  I was really wanting to get a novatouch but drug my feet enough that originative is out now.  I didn't like the fact that the RF had variable weight and wanted to get the FC980C but didn't like that clicky sound at all.  I hope you enjoy your board maybe I'll get one of these now :)
Its manufactured by Hansung Electronics and I assume that it is also assembled/made there but I am not 100% sure on that.
PM
This is new and exciting.
Lmao
I had strongly considered getting one of these plum clones in the past but they seemed too 'plasticy' for me to really enjoy.  I got a hansun gtune version that I am quite pleased with.  I don't have a comparison to genuine topre unfortunately but really enjoy the capacitive switch vs the blues I am used to.
What topre keyboards have you used?  I'm surprised that you like it better but if it isn't broken don't fix it?
I can't decide on one. I may just end up getting both... Hopefully I like at least one of them. I'll sleep on it and then pull the trigger. 
So I ended up agreeing to buy a condo without planning to so I need to decide on one and am still torn Realforce or NovaTouch?
I'm sorry I misread your post and somehow only read notably linear and topre.\n\nAfter a lot of reading on the forum through I decided I'll eventually build what will be my attempt at an end game and am contemplating between zealio switches and mod-m switches.\n\nIn the interim I was very interested in topre switches but couldn't wrap my head around the allure of the HHKB (I am still commited to a numpad thusfar...) and wasn't ready to drop $250+ on any of the realforce keyboards.  I just got a [Topre Clone](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5r4zwn/gtune_chf4_korean_topre_clone_w_typing/) from [Gmarket](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=709867469) and it was only $145.82 with shipping.  I've read that other dislike sound dampening o rings for mx style switches as it deceases the length of travel.\n\nIf you decide to find something else you like, good luck.  I'll echo not fixing what isn't broken if you are happy lol save some $$ :)
no shipping charges during group buy from what it looks like\n
PM
Hey don't tell everyone I want to be able to get one lol. \n\nLooks nice 
>...RealForce is better and 55g is known to be "crisper"...\n\nI believe that the RealForce is variable weight.\n\n>...Topre’s own electrostatic capacitive key switches offer 30 to 45 grams of weighting in the letter area and 55 grams of weighting on the Esc key...\n\nfrom the massdrop listing
In.
I am sorry that I don't have a suggestion that fits your goal.  I wanted to suggest using [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5qztuo/rmechanicalkeyboards_what_keyboard_switches_andor/) post here as you may get more visibility for your question.
I'm interested if you haven't already sold these.
/u/ZealPC any chance of a 96 key PCB in addition to the 65% which is soon ™?
This is arriving tomorrow I'm pumped. 
Thanks.  I couldn't quite tell from the product description.
I am interested. The estimated shipping to the US isn't terrible and the overall cost doesn't seem terrible.  Is it possible to get a package that has metal case/pcb but not switches?  The packages confused me. /u/sakai4eva
PM
http://winkeyless.kr/product/b-mini-x2-pcb/\n
*Aesthetic* 
/u/ThePendulum I am just along for the ride xD.  Rozakiin is the designer of the PCB.  He's said that he would like to do a second revision and the PCB would support more key layouts including the larger left shift.  I'd keep an eye on his posts if you are interested.
I was just looking at the ~ \\ and thought I understood but went to change and realized I didn't O.o.  Could you elaborate thank you very much I am going to look at your FN comment now.
Sending PM now.
I never use mine but they can be mapped as alt keys across the numrow of course.  Enjoy!
/u/MechKeyMaker *redditor for 59 minutes*
lmao! I didn't even realize @ was there... complete accident.\n\nThat is a good point.  I'll triple check with roz as to whether or not I can have a 2.25 sized shift on the left.  It gives me that extra 1u key but it doesn't seem very productive to have it realistically.  
That looks and sounds great.
I am sorry I didn't see that to begin with I did a bad job at skimming.  Maybe stay on the look out and see if there is a group buy.  I would assume it wouldn't be too hard to find someone willing to assemble it for you.  \n\nThis seems like a really nice community I've read people suggestion different users that would do this/they vouched for but I don't know of anyone personally.  Good luck!
[This](http://i.imgur.com/XSGidEH.png) is going to be the layout as far as what the PCB supports after checking with the maker of the PCB.  I'll decide once I get it together and start using it where the hell to map everything. Thank you very much to everyone that commented.
I've been pondering this as of lat thanks for making the post OP.  In for feedback from the community.
I didn't make the pcb but am lucky enough to get one of the prototypes from rozakiin
I'm glad you brought this up. I use Google Voice for everything and only like 4 people know my actual number. I enjoy not getting spam dials and texts how do you deal with that aspect?
PM
> I put 55G springs in my gateron Blacks because I think it is the ideal weight for linears. They're heavy enough for me to not accidentally actuate but light enough for me to consistently bottom out with ease and comfort. I really like them so far.\n\nLooks like I need to do a bit of reading.  Your feedback to me because I am doing my best to just buy what I want without having to test too many different things out.\n\nI just got a Korean topre clone which is an absolute pleasure to type on thusfar.  From what I had read about linears I was inclined to believe that 'typers' prefer tactile switches because of the tactility.  After reading your post above I realized that I liked typing on this clone and it lacked tactility...  The more I read the less I know wtf I want.
I really like the 96 key layut; but, I like the [RS77](http://i.imgur.com/uT12u5b.png) even better.  Congrats /u/Aperture_Sci looks great!
For lack of a better word it sounds more clicky (rather than thocky) in videos and louder can you confirm? Thanks you. 
lol you are right.  This is probably the best advice I'll get as it will come down to preference.
Take my money.
I had the same general consensus from my reading but I've recently seen some people that really enjoy linear switches for typing as well.  For what its worth switches seem to be ultimately personal preference which is why there is so many I suppose.\n
To clarify: Is this your opinion?  I had not read anything saying that the switches themselves were superior only the detail of cherry/topre keycaps.
PM
The packaging for these items of expensive because the materials are delicate
And they're gone.
PM
/u/1954bertonespyder\n\nI have been wanting to order and have been dragging my feet as I can't decide between the F62/F77.  Maybe you can help me.\n\nI currently use a full size keyboard and enjoy the number pad.  The way that I use it includes the enter/+/-/. etc keys.  The F77 has the numbers but lacks the enter key for example.  I am sure there is a historical reason it was made like this but I feel like the area would be largely useless as how I am used to using it.  I've read it is your preferred out of the two.  I am leaning to the F62 because of this just hoping you can push me in one direction or the other.  Thank you sir.
Where did you get the keycaps?
I don't know how I missed this.  I do not have a lot to compare it to from my user experience (just used the filco you see in the vid) but the bump is up towards the 'top' which i believe is how topre switches are generally described.
In!
I also have access to the built in translate from google chrome... I was hoping for individuals that are fluent/familiar with the native language would help translate as half of that doesn't make any sense...
new thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5r4zwn/gtune_chf4_korean_topre_clone_w_typing/)
For 'shift' and the 'idk' key? If so excellent observation thank you!
The author is from the UK so the original layout that I've been manipulating had that as default.\n\nI figured it wouldn't hurt to have it, but also a good point.  I am just not sure how to know what will/won't work with the PCB and I've asked him a billion questions I feel bad lol
Noted, thank you.
Here http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=709867469
I just got a [Topre Clone](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5r4zwn/gtune_chf4_korean_topre_clone_w_typing/) from [Gmarket](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=709867469) and it was $145.82 with shipping.
I am about to go to work. Should I just buy this and be done with my search for endgame?  The board looks to be highly reviewed here and fwiw no longer in production. halp
I'd suggest waiting for Roz, but if you are antsy I found this on taobao a while ago\nhttps://world.taobao.com/item/528963794722.htm?fromSite=main
I wish I never would've learned about the smart 68 :'( I am so sad I missed out on that omg
I didn't think I would need to clarify that... thanks for the help though lol
/u/Rozakiin has a protoype of this essentially you can see his imgur album [here](http://imgur.com/a/amLq8)
Msg'd.
The clone that I am using is 62G but I get lost in the measurements as manufacturers don't use the same methodology for whatever reason.  I have been contemplating this for a while... I was about to pull the trigger on a realforce when the re-released the cnc case for the novatouch....
That's cute.  I remember when I had my first beer.
Indeed there was.  It was made it China despite my original assumption.
I didn't see any other posts, but, I have my flame suit ready.
Ignoring cherry keycaps I believe that the realforce keyboards have better build quality then that of the nova touch without mods?\n\nBut if adding the cnc case and keycaps i imagine that the novatouch would be 'better'?
Coming back with something better! <3
Delete this.  I had absolutely no desire to even dream of thinking about buying an artisan keycap until you posted this.  I will also add that the theme of that keycap does not aesthetically agree with any of my plans for the endgame build I have in mind and also clashes with the current boards I have.\n\nGood day.
The PCB I will be getting will not support split space-bar I'm afraid.  The designer is planning to do a second revision that will support a lot of the things people have mentioned here.  I am not sure if I'll like it or not in practice but I'd like to try it out.  In my head I like my finger not having to travel as far to reach the button similar to that of the HHKB.
Would you please link to this drop I can't find it :/
Pm
I see.  I guess my reasoning was that on my standard full-size ansi layout I have ~ on the left of the board (I don't know if I've ever actually used it lol) and \\ on the right side of the board and my muscle memory would appreciate that. No real reason to rewrite history though.  Thank you.
PM for the Mod-Hs
I think I'll sit on the sidelines thank you.  I have only read of topre switches so I could very well hate them irl.
I've watched some videos and the board doesn't sound as 'thocky' as other Topré boards. What do you think?
I didn't even see you response here somehow.  That actually would be really nice.  I am planning to encourage you for Rev 2 of this and am excited to get your prototype on my desk.
I purchased a [Korean Topre Clone](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=709867469) and plan to update my [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5nvitg/keyboard_spottingthe_topre_clones_are_evolving/) once I get it.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh0AGS1QpWg) is the video that got me curious about that board in the first place.  Good luck on your search!
In reading this thread earlier someone asked about the aluminum plates included in masterwork and you pointed to the image [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0660/7721/products/B87_00_medium.jpg?v=1484651994).  If picking one of the minimal packages I can indicate this is the style I would like?  I am sorry if this is a stupid question thank you very much for your help.
I got the [Hansung Gtune CHF4 XRGB 62G](http://item2.gmarket.co.kr/English/detailview/item.aspx?goodscode=709867469) ordered yesterday.  I ordered last week but my order was automatically cancelled after using paypal.  (To save anyone trouble I followed the directions in their FAQs which asked to send an email which I think solved the problem of verification but I am not totally sure.  I chatted a bit and also made a post on their help board.  None of my inquiries were responded to but the 2nd order wasn't cancelled).  I am having slight buyers remorse by getting the black version instead of the white version but I think in the long run it will age better.  I'll update the post/make a new post once I get it.
what this man said please!
Thank you very much.  I was aware of the New Year and the delay.  I was originally looking for a 96 key layout and was going to get one from winkeyless and stumbled upon this 77 key layout and fell in love.  I was going to give up but LunarisDream linked me to the listing above after I had pm'd him as a last ditch effort.  If I may assume you know a bit about taobao if you would have an opinion on bhinner?  Also would it be improper to ask the seller if they would be interested in selling cases even though it doesn't appear to be listed as an option by itself?  Some of the stock images this seller has for cases match a group buy someone has listed in mechmarket now and they are marketed as b clones as well.  I wonder if I would have luck having that person doing the group buy see if they could somehow hadd this 77 key layout in.   Sorry for the ramble here /u/madn3ss795 I am getting tired.
There is an active group buy on mechmarket right now for a 'bclone' that has a 96 key layout. I'd link but I'm on mobile.  
PM\n
Why is that?
I'm a console gamer lol.  From what I understand if push came to shove with the firmware one can make additional layers where you could hit the keys with just one hand instead of needing to modify with a fn key.
That is REALLY helpful thank you so much.  I was afraid it was a full build and I was wondering if there was any option to de-bundle so to speak.  Would you be so kind as to check that PCB listing to see if it is still valid/available to purchase?  If so I may get several of these to make it worth the build I'd like to do for myself as I am sure I'd be able to sell the extras in the mech market.
It looks like they are used for things like FN or even backspace I guess would be useful but its not supported in the rev 1 of the pcb
Would you please link to this drop I can't find it :/
Estimate on how much at ansi filco majestouch w/ cherry mx blues originally purchased in october of '12 would go for?  Keycaps are original and show their age.  No damage and works perfectly.  Thanks.
ah i see so i should get oem profile keycaps if i want the same height. thank you!

What board is that?
PLEASE ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
Okay this is only mildly related: what kind of desk is that??
I had a dream last night where all of my emotions were somehow being converted into mechanical keyboards and on a conveyor belt into a light\n\nIt was so real
Hahaha yeah, had to get creative there. :)\n\nAlso I definitely put the keycaps on the board on the way to the meetup. It was a mad rush trying to get it done before it started!
...huh.  Especially strange because the one that I ultimately used was the vanilla S60-X.  
This is awesome.  How big is it (in inches) on the sides of the keyboard and the bottom?  I don't have an HHKB but it might fit one of my other boards.
Pick me!
what has been sold and what is still available?
It came with 3 different cables!  2 white (one of which is coiled), and one silver!
Oh nooo he can deal with it, lol.  I'll find a way. ;)
So sorry to hear that friend.  We're here for you if you need someone to talk to!
Oh thank you!  This is great.  How would you program the LEDs?
Holy crap.  As a fellow female software engineer, stay strong.  And he sucks.
Thanks. :)  I wish I could join in this time, but my living situation is in flux right now so shipping in April will be a little crazy on my end.  Next time for sure, these look beautiful.

Same.  Now that I've built my own (which in total cost me I think $210), I'm totally sold on it.
YES, would love this one!
Stalked this thread and ended up here, I'd also be happy to help you with your CS stuff if you need it! :)
Once you learn it you can never go back

Looks good!  In my kit I unfortunately got two different feet, but luckily you don't see them as much. If anyone has any tutorials for the firmware, I'd appreciate it!  And thanks for the kit /u/SentrantPC :)
Awesome, thanks!
Excited about this, congrats on getting to this point!
In the Overcast set is that a white I key, or a - or a 1?
Okay last question, I promise! How did you make your underglow orange?
Wow, this is really legit.  Nice find!

Man, seeing the Round 5 caps is what got me into mechanical keyboards, and I didn't figure out their ordering system in time.  Someday I'll get my hands on it!
That's a good idea.  I'll try that too.  Any recommendations?

Amazing!  Looks great.
The adoration flows through my fingertips!
I read this as "cows" and was very confused for a moment there.
I agree with you there.  It took so long to understand that by the time we got to playing it we weren't even motivated anymore.
Yeah it's a little strange, that's how the switches ended up lining up, and those are the keycaps that fit. :)
I have a 3D printer to test with, if needed!
I'd like that firmware too, please!!  PMed you.
I'd love to see a tutorial for something like this!
They wrote above that it's a custom board.  It's a 60% with GMK Carbon caps. :)
That's smart.  I was thinking I might just DIY one if I couldn't find one.  Thanks!
WOW. GLWS.
I think so!  Waiting on my 60% board to come in, but it looks like it'll be enough! :)
You should make a tutorial for this, they're great!

Heh, nice pun.
Ooh this is pretty.  Great work!
Not my own, but it is by a friend of mine!
That's what I had initially thought, but then both worked for me, which is weird. But thanks! I can add a note to the post.
In mine and ones that my friends have, they're okay.  I haven't had any wear on mine yet.  You can tell they are a little cheaper, but I really like WASD in general so I forgive the keycaps.
It's SO nice.  It feels very balanced and just really high quality.  The MX White/Clear switches on it are the cherry on top (pun intended).  It's gorgeous.

I mean like what are the keycodes for those. :)  I have the toggle working but I can't seem to figure out the color.  Thanks so much for your help, I appreciate it!
Whoa, I love those keys!
Good idea!  Yeah I did use a table saw (it had an angle switch that I used, but definitely was scary putting my hands so close).  I'll check out the band saw + exotic wood next time, thanks!
Good idea! I will.
They have silver ones, but not gold. At least not that I've found.
I've seen metal keycaps that are red and yellow and blue modifiers, but I have no idea where to find them.  Any help?
I was going to bring two keyboards but one of my parts hasn't arrived yet, should I: 1) fill out the form twice, 2) fill it out with just the one guaranteed keyboard 3) fill it out once for both keyboards and just bring one if the parts don't arrive on time?
I just felt my wallet get lighter, I think I went broke just looking at it

If you can get in, the apartment building Dimension at Cedar and 3rd has a great roof for this.
Dang no way!  That sucks. :(\n
We're the same in this regard. The fact that Roller Coaster Tycoon is out on mobile now is very dangerous. ;)
Ooh I want these.
Thanks!! This is just my first batch (and I was using borrowed tools), but if there's enough interest I'll definitely consider it.
Are those zinc mods gold or silver? Can't tell from the photo very well.
I got some of these too, don't expect anything heavy duty. :)
And there's 500, at the 16 hour mark!  Awesome!
Hmmm I can't find those gold ones.  I found a couple on geekkeys.com but they don't have all the modifiers.  If you remember the brand/where you got them, I'd appreciate it!!
Could you share the model you made, if you're willing?  I'd love to tinker with it! :)
The note was awesome, too: "I heard you liked SA caps, so have some unicorn vomit" lol.  Thanks again /u/australianburrito!!
Hahaha I didn't make this, I just thought it was a cool video.  I agree if they added different layers and a coat it'd look better.  I'd love to later see a case like this with LEDs matching both sides. :)
12!
I'd do a gray sofa with a patterned rug!

my wallet is crying
This picture made my sister officially get into keyboards.  YES.  What caps/case/etc is this made of? :)
Is there such thing as an 87-key wooden case?  I can't seem to find one online but I might not be searching correctly.
In Spain they call it a "double-v" and in Mexico a "double-u", interestingly.
I followed the photo credit link:\nbuff.ly/2llXPsD\n\nWhere I found it in this blog post:\nhttps://lacotovie.com/2016/09/29/decor-bananeiras-pela-casa/\n\nWhich is a post about the plants in the pic, and that photo leads to a much larger site of too many pics to go through. :/\n\nOne thing, all of these sites used a bunch of furniture from this site, which might be a good starting point: https://www.duralee.com/\n\nSo, that might be somewhat helpful.  Good luck!\n
Agree, I also liked Boss Monster!
For the Pok3r, is it *just* the white case, backlight, clears, and keycaps, or is it a working keyboard with a PCB and everything?  Can't tell from the picture.
Darn, no Elvish keycaps this time. :(
PMing
You'll find stores dotted around Tokyo, which when you get inside you'll realise have 8 floors filled with goodies. Friends weren't Impressed when I emerged a few hours later. The back streets of akihabara have alot of retreat stores where if.your lucky you can pick up a bargain. In Osaka there's alot of markets and stalls. Don't really remember if there was slot for the keyboard. Wasn't into the craze back then 
I think this video could help you out :) \nhttps://youtu.be/f2MHE-rQPRA
Someone mentioned showing your passport and I think taxes get cut or some sort of adjustment to the price. 
How about a store where you can buy components (switches plates pcb etc?)
Oh hey, I'm going to Japan too next month! Thanks for this thread.
Seconding Tsukumo - picked up my FC660C there, they have a ton of stuff out and available to try out.
Visit Sofmap and Tsukumo in Akihabara, they display keyboards in brand sections and are usually on display for people to try out.
Kreygasm
:D
wifi masterrace mate 👌\nSick keyboard tho !
Hell yeah ! What a bo5 :D\n26k viewers peak on twitch !
I think everyone has CCleaner but uninstalling isn't a solution it happens from time to time but still working great while it's on
Any chance we'll have the possibility to purchase it in ISO in the future ? :p
Ah d'accord et du coup c'est une revue indépendante ou quelque chose pour un site spécialisé ?
So you think the Leopold is less customisable than the Varmilo ? \nAlso I have a Quickfire Ultimate with browns since 2014 and I'd like to switch for blues :D \nI don't remember if Gat blues also feel smoother than Cherry ones.\nAbout the floating keycaps the blue switches sounds (way) more noisy on the Varmilo tho I don't know what do think about that cos I'd like a clicky keyboard but not extremely lound tho :p
love your name btw my fellow countryman :D
Ça fait le clavier dans les 150€ pour nous non ?
*mi-mars, heureusement car 3 mois pour un clavier ça aurait été abusé ^^
Do you need the number pad ?
Help me to choose but no suggestions yet ? Did you ever make research ?
what a deal :D 
How can you be so naive lol\nOf course this is pre-recorded, in fact I belive they do all the transitions and this kind of thig, then just play with knobs during the actual thing lol. 
clack/10 !
Hi ! I asked the exact same question in an email and they replied there will be a stock of 750R in mid-february ! Can't wait to pick mine aswell :D
Sympa ton nom ça me rappelle ma dernière année de licence l'année dernière :)
ISO masterrace ?
C'est néanmoins très proche vu qu'il est TKL
Oh ok :)\nAnd yes I know how to turn them off, by pressing function key and arrow keys
You should directly contact Varmilo's rep at this email: zhh19@zhihaihe.cn
"lizard" method amrite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Du Leopold en ISO FR je prendrais direct par contre ^_^\nC'était quand le dernier meetup à Paris ?
it's a G402 :)
Tu vas faire une review mais tu ne pourras pas le garder ? Je ne comprends pas trop :p\nTu parles du VA69M toi ?
Tu veux dire du Varmilo ou Leopold d'occasion sur le mechmarket ? 
Cool merci ;)
Le mechmarket en europe c'est quasiment désert :/ \nJe n'ai même pas espoir de vendre mon Quickfire là-dessus non plus :/
chiche ou pas :p
it's the masculine for "the". We also have "la" for feminine articles :)
"Varmilo Round 5 (Varmilo Keyboards ordered between 7th - 21st February 2017)" ça devrait le faire pour toi alors mais il faudra mettre le réveil pour ne pas oublier :p
Hi dude ! Since you have both FC750R and VA87M, I'm hesitating between these two, could you tell me your preference and pros/cons of each keyboard ? It'd really help me :D 
Do you know if there's a switch tester with Cherry and gateron blues ?
What about the layout ? I assume you're looking for a ANSI layout ? If so, you could add the Leopold FC750R, which is not a backlit keyboard but really good quality overall !
LOL
For questions about the VA87MR you should contact the official Varmilo rep at this email zhh19@zhihaihe.cn or even Caps Unlocked here http://shop.caps-unlocked.com/contact because they're doing a GB for Varmilo keyboards :)
Noice !\nWhat's the mousepad by the way ?
Yep but those are ABS tho ^^
Hallelujah ! :DDD
Hey ! I'm about to buy this one and hesitating on the case color. By dark blue you mean it's the default blue case mentionned on the caps unlocked site right ? What's the white positioning plate ? By default it's black ? And last you said you were disappointed by the case,by that you meant the color or the quality ? \n\nThanks :D
130 £ pour le VA88M\n165£ pour le VA69M
Alright thanks !
Clack/10 my friend\nAlso the city you live in seems beautiful with the lake :O
Lovely !
Do you realize you failed to hide your name at the top left corner ? Just saying mate :)
Looking good ! What switches do you have on the VA87M ?
It's unrelated but do you think the Quickfire Ultimate is worth a bit more ?\n\nHave a nice sale :)
This is totally accurate man
G2 = FailFish\n\nNa'vi = FireSpeed\n\nFaZe = EleGiggle\n\nFnatic = BCWarrior
whisky ?? you mean champagne man :DD
well memed my friend :D
FeelsBadMan\n\nISO masterrace
No side-printed on any of these VA88M rip :'(
Oui je te rejoins sur ce dernier point malheureusement :/
How do you like it so far ? What switches did you get ?
Ok thanks for the info :D
Omelette du fromage hon hon hon
Oui effectivement en azerty c'est mission impossible mais je lorgne aussi sur le Leopold FC750R il y a quasiment 35€ d'écart et pas de délai de livraison d'un mois et demi :/ (mais pas de rétroéclairage ni ISO FR non plus ...)
Oui c'est correct et tant mieux :D\nJ'hésite sur la combinaison case/keycaps/leds maintenant :p
140 wpm PogChamp
Oui il est question du VA88M j'ai oublié de préciser ^^ donc ça reste pas mal mais un peu cher pour moi :/
What's "not too costly" for you ? like 50$ or more ? I guess you don't need backlighting ?
Thanks !
don't you have problem with this keyset and the leds ?
Thanks a lot for the quick reply ! :D
Dan(in)k m8
yep just a blue plastic part on the left side :)
Yeah but you gotta celebrate this purchase :D Or maybe just keep the champagne for the unboxing haha 
Tu as pris un VA108 ou 109 du coup ?
By grey mods you mean the keys on the side like shift, control and alphas are the main caps ?
May I ask you some links please ? :D
Oh sorry lol I didn't say anything important it was something like "it should be alright for you to order on the 21th but you'll need to put the alarm ON" :'D
thanks !
Juste par curiosité tu as déjà fait des revues sur d'autres claviers ?
Tricheur haha :D\nJe viens de me rendre compte de quelque chose: au pire si je choppe un Leopold en ANSI et je j'ai du mal avec le layout, je peux switch le langage dans Windows ça donnera la même chose ? (Juste les keycaps qui ne correspondront pas du coup)
Sounds good ! Thanks :D
Mourrir vite ? Qu'est ce qui te fait dire ça ? Tu veux dire au profit d'autre layout en France genre Dvorak ?
Snowden cap aswell !
is this a VA87M ?
and new keycaps aswell http://puu.sh/tBBAy/54b2a6d33c.jpg
oh\nmy\ngodness
Alright thanks for the reply ! I'm thinking about a blue case, white or dark grey keycaps (maybe both) with orange leds (or blue ?) but I'm not sure about the final rendering of the parts togather :D
rhaaa c'est dur de choisir, déjà il faudrait que je m'assure de revendre mon Quickfire Ultimate, je sais pas si sur le bon coin ça partirait à un bon prix. Et j'hésite aussi a passer à l'ANSI :/
not sure what you expect for Cherry MX RBG then :p
Looks amazing !
Hey what model do you have ?
Merci :)\nTu as déjà testé du ANSI toi ? 
Yeah I only own one keyboard and it's MX brown aswell. Feeling good but I'd like to change for some blue switches :)
FeelsGoodMan\n\nWelcome to the mech family :D
Also I'd like to know if it's possible to change the keycaps on a blue case because pink and blue keycaps meh :D
I can find these wayyy cheaper but only in ISO FR :)
What if they're better but on Varmilo keyboards they're not under guarantee ? :(
Alright thanks for the reply and enjoy your keeb :D
Hello !\nI got a CM Storm Quickfire Ultimate with MX browns !
Haha I'm tempted to go with the blanks but I'm afraid to forget everything :D
amazing but ... where's the Kappa for K keycap ??
You know what it says right: once you go black, you never go back ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What key cap set is that? It looks awesome!
Yeah I like both aswell but the leds on the Varmilo are cool :)\nFloating keys looks amazing but it will be noiser than the Leopold and its absorbing pad but well :D
Flaired as satire
The aluminum case sounds nice, but programmability isn't really important to me. Thanks for your suggestion.

If you channel your inner Nazi, anything is possible.
Unfortunately your post has been removed, for the following reason(s):\n\n\n\n* Your post was deemed spam. Posts by companies are ok provided their content is good. If it just to promote a single company or set of habits/uses/list of things without actually providing something that is interesting in infographic form, it will be removed.
Oh no! What can we complain about now?
That was an amazing rally

We're not looking for any more mods currently. Thanks for expressing interest!
Nice to see another Aussie on here. Thanks for sharing your office! It looks great.
Following the format gives you a much better chance of getting good advice. Is isolation important? Are you planning on using them in public? Are they replacements / complements to what you currently have? What kind of sound are you looking for?
Sure thing! I'm not familiar with the song or genre, but the X00s definitely reach lower with more detail than the 700s. However, the Stax win out in a competition between all 3.

You're right, it was obviously that you were being sarcastic.
For those genres, I would recommend looking into some planar magnetics - maybe a Hifiman 400S or 400i, maybe a fostex mod. A lot of people here swear by ZMF's fostex mods, but I don't have any experience with them.

I'm looking for a 60% keyboard, preferably with MX Browns, that's a little bit cheaper than a Pok3r. Should I save for the pok3r, or are there better options for less money?

So far I've only had experience with MX Browns. I would like a switch with slightly more actuation force, but not too much more. What switch should I go for?
Haha, enjoy the gold.

I am willing to branch out into linear, but not clicky. I really like the MX Browns, but they're just too easy to press.

I'm waiting
wew
Yeah, I got the same thing with mine - no comfort issues though
Velour pads will leak more. I'm not sure about whether or not they'll fit, but Brainwavz hybrid pads have velour just where they touch your head, which would probably decrease the amount of leakage. 
A friend of mine is a big fan of Sony DAPs, though I'm not familiar enough to recommend a specific model. 
Have you considered looking at CIEMs? They best any IEMs I've tried in comfort and isolation. 
PM'd
Is there any specific reason you're going for universal IEMs -> custom tips rather than just CIEMs?
Active noise cancelling only really shines in environments with constant noise, IE airplanes. In a library, passive isolation from a closed back pair will most likely be perfectly sufficient. 
Where did you find it? I'm gonna be in Tokyo in 6 days, and looking to pick up a 660C as well!
You might consider picking up a Fostex T50RP mk3 and a set of replacement pads. I use ZMF cowhide on mine, and with a simple suspension strap mod from an old leather belt, they're pretty comfortable. 
Impedance determines how much current an amp will be able to push to the headphones, and sensitivity determines how much sound comes out for a given current (or, if given in voltage, combines impedance and sensitivity). 
At that price level, have you considered trying for CIEMs? I used to be skeptical of them, but mine have convinced me that they are king of mobile use. 
Or spend $30 on a transformer just to be extra careful with your $200-1k stax amp
In terms of active noise cancelling, I think Bose is your best bet.
I would wait for someone more familiar with Etymotics to respond - all I know is that the ER-4 is generally regarded pretty well. Good luck with your search!
Hi,\n\nI've been trolling around for [this](http://omiai-dakimakura.com/%E6%9D%B1%E6%96%B9project/12843) cover for the past few months, but haven't been able to find anything. Does anyone have any leads / other places I should be checking? Mainly I've just been giving yahoo auctions a search every few days.\n\nThank you!
And do you think they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy their purchase? It is possible to push people towards higher quality audio without putting them down for what they already have.
I just don't think we're gonna come to a peaceful agreement here
Looks like you're going to have to sew the hole shut - if you can't get the pads off, I'm not sure if there's enough room to maneuver a needle in there. 
Converters are pretty cheap though? Sub-$40. You only need a little one, power draw of most Stax amps is pretty low wattage. 
I don't have experience with them personally - might be best to order from a place with a good return policy (Amazon, etc.) in case the clamp is too much / the sound isn't to your liking. Good luck!
Is there any way to check on the status of a bwstore order? I preordered [this](http://bwstore.com.tw/index.php?action=product&do=prd_detail&id=661) [trap warning] cover back in the order period, and the estimated ship date is mid-september. Since the order confirmation email, I haven't gotten anything else. 
Stax baby
Driver count != quality of IEM
For pressure, I usually pull up on the top of my ear while it's in. This breaks the seal just enough to release excess pressure behind the CIEM. As for the sound, I've always found my 3Cs to be fine in terms of treble, but then again, I think I lean towards a brighter sound. 
ANC like the QC25 is really good at blocking droning sound, like the whine of the airplane engines. If it's the people talking around you that's more bothersome, good passive isolation is probably your best bet. The best isolation you can get is either from Etymotics IEMs or CIEMs. 
Hey, try it out - might be the best closed headphone you've ever heard. Good luck!
No problem, hope you find what you're looking for!
To offer another perspective on the HD700s, I really do enjoy mine. I would definitely recommend seeing if you can find a place to audition them, because I can definitely understand them not being for everyone.\n\nAs for other recommendations, you're in a range where you can probably spring for an electrostatic setup. I can easily recommend the Stax 3170 system (307 + 323), and many others here will recommend the 2170 (207 + 252).
I had the same thing happen buying through Amazon - just did a return and the next one was right
For intimate sound, I absolutely love my Stax 307. They are very open though, so I'm not sure if they're right for your situation. \n\nIf closed is what you need, I would actually recommend saving for a few more weeks / months to get up to an Ether C. Best closed headphone I've ever heard, by far.
My dad has a set of the EL-8 opens - while they're not really for me, they are definitely a good headphone if you are a fan of Audeze sound.
Microphone stand, I wish it was as useful as a light
Some suggestions you might want to try to audition: Senn HD650, Oppo PM2, Audeze LCD-X\n\nI tend towards brighter headphones, but from what I know these all have some degree of treble rolloff. 
Something else right around that range is the Fostex TH900, if you're into bass. Definitely try to audition before you buy, especially if you're spending that much - that or buy from somewhere with a good return policy. 
PMing
It still seems like I need to be able to pull the bottom out while twisting though? I can't get a decent grip on it. How much pressure would you put on the cable connector?
This seems to be completely different than fazors - correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't fazors just an addition rather than a different porting pattern?
From what I understand, silicone CIEMs isolate quite a bit more. Although, I have a pair of acrylic and the thought of any more isolation is somewhat frightening...
Sennheiser Momentums have a nice warm signature - I've only heard the first gen, but from what I've read the second gen is regarded as an overall improvement.
Well then I guess you remember someone quoting the video. 
I submitted ten puns to a pun contest, hoping one would win. But no pun in ten did. 
Are you finding your Q701s not fulfilling your immersion requirements? I haven't heard them specifically, but a friend's 700-series, and it seems like their sound stage is pretty expansive?
I think you can get a decent idea by checking the e-earphone site, or other Japanese electronics stores websites. Conversion hovers around 120JPY to 1USD, as far as I know. 
If you need multiple people, I'll be around later this afternoon / evening. PM your Skype if so
ATH-MSR7s and Oppo PM3s are the staples for that range and type. Maybe see if there are any places near you that might have one of them available to audition?
I think you're sort of at a range where there are a lot of good choices - I would see if you could find a place close by to try out a few headphones with your preferred music.\n\nUsually the go-to in that range are the HD600s or 650s, but I'm not sure how well they handle Hip-Hop/Electro. Maybe look into like a Hifiman 400S or 400i? Other good choices off the top of my head are Fostex mods, AKG 7-series. As for amp/DAC, Schiit is probably your best option, unless you can get a better price on an o2/ODAC setup.
I think the best way to start with electrostats is to pick up a Stax 207 with the small amp (can't remember the number off the top of my head). Usually non-Japanese sellers are really expensive - I would check out like yahoo Japan auctions for people reselling their setups. That's where I got my 307+amp. 
Heck yes it is - you into utaite as well?
A man after my own heart <3
YoiYoi Kokon though - who doesn't love utaite trap?
I had some leftover Amazon gift card balance on my US Amazon account, so it made more sense for me to go with that.
How dare they be given ballots! Ballots to vote with? Why I never!
It's a tumblr meme from 2014
Ah, sorry - was thinking of pounds. 
I'm trying to get this running on my f2k, but it keeps throwing javascript errors "'_' is undefined" for the playback buttons and seekbar. Any ideas about what might be going on? \n\nErrors: http://imgur.com/a/AaoCG\n\nEdit: Fixed - had script files in %fb2k_profile%/files rather than in %fb2k_profile%/js_marc2003/files
I don't know any methods other than just trying it out - from what I've heard, its pretty rare.
That's pretty open-ended - in that range, I've seen Oppo PM3s and ATH-MSR7s recommended, but without knowing what kind of sound you're looking for, your past headphones, the music you like, it's hard to recommend a specific pair.
For a bass-centric headphone in that range, I don't think you could go wrong looking at the Fostex Th900.
I'm so glad you guys are putting out male covers ~ Felix instaordered. I hope there are more dudes on the horizon? There aren't enough good male covers out there!
I think the issue is that that style of headset is primarily used in like a phonebank setting. Have you considered maybe looking for an open-back with low clamp? Just as an example, my HD700s don't press on the sides of my head at all, they just sit in position. 
Read some reviews, find a set that seems interesting to you, then most companies have a pretty comprehensive guide to getting things all set up. You just need to find an audiologist near you that will do impressions - I think 64ears has a map of recommended audiologists that they've received good impressions from.\n\nI can recommend Noble myself, but definitely look around at other companies.
I'm so jealous of that Nagato. And I'm going to suruga-ya today as well! You beat me to it uwu
I was never able to find any info on it, but I am a huge fan of this Bosshi cover (http://img.xbooru.com//images/346/acafd8332849e37274d75afc62b02243.jpeg?387883). I hope he puts out more futabu covers ;w;
*Meanwhile at Beyerdynamic HQ...*\n\n"Johnson! Did you run the new designs by Dreyka before production?"\n\n"Oh no..."\n\n"Yeah you're right oh no, and guess what? Dreyka doesn't like them!"\n\n"But if Drekya doesn't like them, how is anyone supposed to enjoy them?..."\n\n"They won't! The entire lineup, nay, the company is ruined! I hope in your next job you remember to run everything by Dreyka, last bastion of truth and justice in this world of liars and idiots."
If thats like an externally powered USB hub, it should clean up USB power.
My Nobles feel incredibly sturdy, I've never felt worried about handling them (even though I do still baby them a bit). The build time is pretty significant though, bordering on 2 months. In my case, it was definitely worth the wait, but I can see how time constraints could push you another direction.\n\nIf I'm remembering correctly, Noble and Westone (?) offer 3D printed CIEMs which should build much faster, might be something to look into. 
The setup seems to go for around $500 new in the US, so I would probably shoot for 30-35000 JPY used. I got my 3170 for ~55000 JPY very lightly used, so I think 35k is a reasonable goal. Also, keep in mind shipping is going to be pretty significant - probably on the order of $60-80 USD. Good luck, and happy auction hunting!\n\nEdit: One more thing to keep in mind if you end up finding a Japanese version, is that you'll need a small transformer from your mains voltage to Japan's (110V if I remember right?). It doesn't draw too many watts, so a small transformer should do just fine. 
The amount of sound that comes out of a headphone at a given power level us based on both it's impedance and sensitivity (dB/mW). At a basic level, the higher the impedance, the lower the number of watts a given voltage will push, and the lower the sensitivity, the less sound a given amount of watts will produce. 
I don't recall how it came about that they sent their dead to that asteroid - if it was something set up by some other advanced race, it's possible they could be the source for that tech as well. 
At your budget, you can start getting into CIEMs - have you considered them? Personally, I much prefer them to IEMs. 
I don't think I'm great at descriptions, so I won't try to go into too much detail.\n\nIn short, I really like these! While I still think I prefer vocals [and comfort] on the 700s, these win out just about everywhere else. They might be my new go-to! \n\nThat low end tho\n\nIf there is interest, I can try to write up more after I get some more time with them later today.\n\n[edit] Longer form impressions added in another comment.
That's only an issue if your USB power supply is noisy - much much less common than a noisy onboard DAC. 
If you don't want to screw around with the insides, you could always get a stepdown transformer from 230 to 117v. 
I would recommend just picking up an amp for now, as that'll probably make a much larger difference than a dedicated DAC. In that case, can't go wrong with a Magni. 
Thanks! 
u take that back
Has anyone been able to order through Sakura Palace? Every time I try to check out on the linked page, it redirects me to the cart...
Well thats depressing
Need good exchange to buy my weaboo trash
I'm currently using my Japan 100V Stax amp through a 120V -> 100V step-down transformer. You can plug it directly into US 120V mains, but if there is any chance of delivering too much power, I think it's much safer to just get a step-down transformer and plug it in through that. 
You should probably get a step-up transformer so that you're delivering the right amount of power to it. In future, just get the version that accepts the same voltage as your country's mains. 
HD598s, then I went crazy with an HD700 and Stax 307 setup. 
You will probably be fine without an amp - at the very least, wait and see what it's like straight out of your phone. 
Ah yeah, that episode - again, I'm guessing it would just have to do with some artificial gravity tech setup on the asteroid. 
I ordered just the PCB, diodes, controller, and cable from Phil. Case I got cut from Ponoko. I'm glad it turned out looking as good as it does!
I'm not sure if the currency conversion puts it in your price range, but I think MrSpeakers Ether C fits your criteria pretty well. I auditioned them and absolutely loved them - best quality bass I've heard on a headphone, by far. 
Wasn't that asteroid inhabited by some alien race? (Videans, maybe?) Surely it's possible that they had some artificial gravity tech installed on it. 
Longer form impressions as requested! Again, I'll mention that I don't think I'm that great with descriptions. Additionally, I can only tell you what I hear, so YMMV.\n\nMain songs:\n\n* Shibayan Records - MyonMyonMyonMyonMyon!\n* Shibayan Records - Fall in the Dark\n* The Raconteurs - The Switch and the Spur\n* the pillows - HYBRID RAINBOW\n* Max Coveri - Running in the 90's\n* Tycho - Montana\n* Mafumafu - Natsu Matsuri\n* Yosi Horikawa - Letter\n\nOverall, I found the X00s to be a nice medium between the SR-307 and HD700s. Bass quality approaching that of the Stax, with presentation and "natural"-ness approaching the 700s. \n\nI've always preferred the Stax for just about everything except vocals - in particular, the low-end speed and reach is incredible [Myonx5 + Running in the 90s], and the reproduction of things like the guitar solo in The Switch and the Spur is fantastic. However, the soundstage is a bit strange, and can sometimes make things all sound a bit flat.\n\nThe X00s take these strengths and add a wider soundstage [Letter], with more forward vocals [Natsu Matsuri]. I don't feel as though I'm missing out in any respect when listening. The Stax definitely do some things better, but the overall package in the X00 wins out in my opinion.\n\nIn the end, I think that the X00s might very well be my new daily drivers! If anyone has any more questions, specific songs they want to hear my impressions / comparisons of, feel free to ask.
At that budget you can get into CIEMs if you're willing - they best any IEMs I've tried in comfort and isolation. 
I was never able to find any info on it, but I am a huge fan of this Bosshi cover (http://img.xbooru.com//images/346/acafd8332849e37274d75afc62b02243.jpeg?387883). Does anybody have any information about it? I hope he puts out more futabu covers ;w;
At that range, you're coming up to the point where it might be worth going for CIEMs. Have you considered it? They are the best I've ever tried in terms of comfort.
It's all just wires - RCA has slightly better crosstalk performance, but not at the audible level (on the order of ~-95db - -105)
Not unexpected
Haven't hit up any K-On! songs yet, but you know I went through some FLCL OST and Tanaka
