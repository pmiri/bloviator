ety's ills, and arbitrarily deporting people.. Then fewer people would want to kill themselves.\n\nThat's why I'm a socialist. Even though I'm regularly reminded by well wishing liberals that its unrealistic and only works on paper. I'd recommend others think about how to be part of the solution and how socialism could reshape society in such a way that poverty and despair became impossible. 
>I literally just got banned from communism 101 yesterday for simply asking why South Korea has a much higher quality of life than North Korea\n\nJust looked at your post and I honestly think it was unreasonable for you to be banned for that. You're coming at the analysis from a very ideological position, but you shouldn't be chastised for that in a educational sub.\n\n>I guess freedom of speech isn't really respected in the Communist world\n\nI mean, no, we don't respect the bourgeois notion of "free speech," and we're consistent and honest with this position. Contrarily within the self described "[bastions of free speech](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4nqic8/the_donald_is_the_last_bastion_of_free_speech_on/)" such as r/conservative you would get banned for criticising the GOP, or in il_douche for criticising the cheeto benito.\n\n>some of the people in trying to answer my question were actually arguing that North Korea actually has a higher quality of life than South Korea\n\nThat depends how you define quality of life doesn't it. Did you stop to think about what that metric even means? It is undoubtedly verifiable fact that the standard of living and economic growth in DPRK was much greater than ROK up until the late '80s and early '90s. \n\nFirst the situation in ROK. More than 45% of citizens over the age of 65 live in poverty. The poorest and most oppressed citizens of ROK work long hours for low pay. Students are expected to do a full day at school, then those students whose parents can afford it will scrape together enough money to send them to after school programs to study late, often until midnight, just so that they can have the chance to maybe one day be able to work at Samsung or other big Korean company. This is socially and mentally very unhealthy for both the parents and the children. Rent prices are extremely high compared to salaries for the working class. Yes ofc there are lots of rich people in ROK, but there are also lots of [slums](https://i.imgur.com/1ftU29o.jpg)\n\nIn DPRK all education, housing and healthcare is free and guaranteed (and even [much better than most developing countries](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10665964). Everyone is guaranteed employment. But... the county suffers from fuel shortages, food shortages, and lack of raw materials.\n\nSo what are the causes of these differences? The main factor is that DPRK has been blockaded and sanctioned by the US for decades, whereas ROK makes $60bn in trades with the US annually and has received $18.7bn in assistance from USAID. A second important consideration is that most of the arable land in Korea is in the Southern half of the country, whereas the north is predominantly non-arable mountain regions. DPRK can't even sell its resources in order to buy grain because of the sanctions.\n\n>it is just the media lying\n\nWell, to be fair, they have a serious habit of [lying, almost constantly](https://anti-imperialism.org/2014/08/14/western-dprk-propaganda-the-worst-occasionally-hilarious-and-often-racist-lies/).\n\n> That's how married to this failed ideology they are.\n\nNot failed and also not an ideology.

If we're un jerking, I think the Leninist position is that you can't invade a country and force them to be socialist, the working class must support and work towards revolution for themselves   
Capitalism bro. Something Marx called "tendency for the rate of profit to fall." Also the "inherent contradictions of capital." Basically the capitalists always want to increase their profits (shareholders, CEOs, whomever) you can increase profits by suppressing wages (paying workers less). But the less they pay their workers, the less money people have to buy their products. This is an oversimplification because there are other factors, like inflation, artificial scarcity, etc. But ultimately the all lead to the buttfucking of the average person.

I care my friend. 
The then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in September 2004 that: "From our point of view and the UN Charter point of view, it [the war] was illegal."\n\nAlso did you even read the article you posted:\n\n>Only four countries announced they would support a resolution backing the war\n\n>The Institute for Policy Studies published a report[11] analyzing what it called the "arm-twisting offensive" by the United States government to get nations to support it. Although President Bush described nations supporting him as the "coalition of the willing", the report concluded that it was more accurately described as a "coalition of the coerced." According to the report, most nations supporting Bush "were recruited through coercion, bullying, and bribery." The techniques used to pressure nations to support the United States included a variety of incentives including:\n\n   * Promises of aid and loan guarantees to nations who supported the US\n   * Promises of military assistance to nations who supported the US\n   * Threats to veto NATO membership applications for countries who don't do what the US asked\n   * Leveraging the size of the US export market and US influence over financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n   * Deciding which countries receive trade benefits under such laws as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which, as one of its conditions for eligibility for such benefits, requires that a country does "not engage in activities that undermine United States national security interests".\n   * Deciding what countries it should buy petroleum from in stocking its strategic reserves. The US has exerted such pressure on several oil-exporting nations, such as Mexico.\n\n\nIn addition to the above tactics, the British newspaper The Observer published an investigative report revealing that the National Security Agency of the United States was conducting a secret surveillance operation directed at intercepting the telephone and email communications of several Security Council diplomats, both in their offices and in their homes. This campaign, the result of a directive by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, was aimed primarily at the delegations from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan. The investigative report cited an NSA memo which advised senior agency officials that it was "'mounting a surge' aimed at gleaning information not only on how delegations on the Security Council will vote on any second resolution on Iraq, but also 'policies', 'negotiating positions', 'alliances' and 'dependencies' - the 'whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers an edge in obtaining results favourable to US goals or to head off surprises'."[12]\n\nThe story was carried by the European and Australian press, and served as a further embarrassment to the Bush administration's efforts to rally support for an invasion of Iraq. Wayne Madsen, who was a communications security analyst with the NSA in the 1980s, believes the memo is authentic and believes the memo was aimed at other nations who are part of the ECHELON intelligence network, namely Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK. Additionally, a member or Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), Katharine Gun was charged under the Official Secrets Act 1989 in connection with the leaking of the memo. She stated her intention to plead not guilty on the grounds that her actions were justified to prevent an illegal war. The case against her was dropped after the prosecution declined to present any evidence at her trial.[13]\n\nClare Short, a British cabinet minister who resigned in May 2003 over the war, stated in media interviews that British intelligence regularly spied on UN officials. She stated that she had read transcripts of Kofi Annan's conversations.
Depends whose side the military is on. In historical examples many soldiers disbanded or defected.

It isn't the victims fault they got run over, but you can reduce risk of injury by being aware of different hazards. It's a question of awareness of danger rather than an accusation of fault of blame. \n\nIf we can make people aware of these dangers, we might be able to reduce injuries on the road by helping people minimise risk to themselves of aggressive or inattentive drivers. \n\nSome of those hazards are the [blind spots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9E1_1M-qhU) of heavier vehicles.

Labour are a bunch of hacks trying to present anti-worker policies in a worker-friendly package and everyone is tired of their bullshit.

They dragged their heels for months looking for excuse after excuse to not ban jailbait - which was a sub for sexually provocative photographs of 14 year old girls. They eventually only banned it because mainstream media started reporting on it and they were worried it made them look bad. The whole time they were in conversation with the subreddit moderator and were trying to protect him and his community. Tldr reddit admins are child porn enablers.
Well, that and the fact that you can arm and train "moderate rebels" in countries that won't sell you oil, then when the "moderate rebels" get shelled by their government you whine about how oppressive that government is, use it as justification to invade them, and steal their oil.

>You do realize many nations are capitalism yet developing world and have absolutely insane wealth gaps. It's not like all nations enjoy the fruits of their labors nor do many workers have the Unions and rights as developed nations. \n\nI mean that's kind of my point. The workers in an exploited country might look poorer than soviet workers, and the workers in an imperialist country might look richer. Workers in exploited countries (eg India) can work incredibly hard in very poor conditions, even though there are many millionaires in India. Meanwhile workers in imperialist countries (EU/US) typically enjoy shorter working hours, better pay, and in some cases guaranteed healthcare and education. The workers in imperialist countries benefit from the super exploitation of developing countries and the profits that exploitation generates.
Yes they wore rolex because they were gifted them by the soviets. In the 1950s rolex made chronographs that were very popular with pilots and other people who needed to very accurately keep track of time (such as military commanders). Castro wore 2 rolexs, one set to Cuban time and one set to Moscow time.\n\nIt even says in the article you kindly linked "Rolex watches weren’t a status symbol when this picture was taken. They were considered some of the most functional accurate watches of their time (before quartz era started)."\n\nBut _now_ rolex is a luxury brand, that relies on what Marx called "commodity fetishism" and the whole advert was an exercise in commodity fetishism. Something that Marx and Guevara would have been disgusted by.

>Socialism is a movement based on ideals, and idealism doesn't work\n\n[That really couldn't be further from the truth](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/). Socialism is based on historical and dialectical materialism, rather than Hegelian dialectics. This means it is founded on an evidence based _materialist_ understanding of society, and the conflicts that arise from different class interests - manifesting as physical conflict as opposed to ideological battles. Marxism is the social equivalent of the scientific method, it is analytical and advances and changes its analysis based on the changes in society. 
About time to roll out the guillotines I reckon.
>You are living in a delusion if you think he kicked out gangsters.\n\nThere's a reason he's popular in Russia. He brought some stability to a country in Chaos. Life in Russia for most people is much better than it is in other SSRs or non-aligned formerly communist countries with leaders who are just as corrupt. Which suggests to me that the Russian government must be doing at least a few things right. And one of those things is not allowing their country to turn into a [literal dumping ground](http://www.intellinews.com/albanians-fear-country-will-become-rubbish-dump-of-europe-108278/) at the detriment to Western Finance capital.\n\n> We have only sanctioned Russia when they have broken UN laws, by invading other countries without UN remit. \n\nWhy haven't US, France and Britain been sanctioned then? Why haven't we sanctioned ourselves, why haven't we arrested Tony Blair? This is a very selective enforcement of international law going on here... Almost as if we don't care about UN laws and only use them as an excuse to punish countries we don’t like.\n\n> They do want their buffer with Europe in E. Europe though\n\nI mean, I think it's pretty reasonable to be opposed to a hostile government supporting the overthrowing of the governments of countries that border you, and installing leaders who are do what they're told by them.

>the average life expectancy in North Korea is 69, while the average life expectancy in South Korea is 81.37 as of 2012\n\nRight, ok, this is great. Higher life expectancy is good. But how can DPRK improve life expectancy when they are existing under blockade? While they have no arable land? While no country is allowed, by decree of the US, to trade with them? It is difficult. You can't look at these two examples compare them as if they are equal when one is being held down with a great deal of force, while the other received billions in aid. When one was completely destroyed in war, and the other was heavily invested in by imperialist powers. \n\n>  Also, why don't all of you communist supporters move to a communist country?

> How could socialism flip that formula?\n\nBy getting rid of a parasitic class who suppress workers wages (and among other things massively inflate the prices of life saving treatments, destroy the environment, create global economic crises, lobby governments to start wars, etc.) in order to maximise their profits - which they then either use to solidify their positions of power and make more money for themselves or they stash away in off shore accounts.\n\nWe can and should re-organise society in such a way that labour power is not directed towards maximising personal profits of a wealthy ruling class, but is instead directed towards the social benefit of all of humanity. Not only could this, in theory, provide more than enough for everyone, but it has been demonstrated in practice.

My favourite was the Clinton email hack. The DNC blamed Russia, which served two purposes. Firstly it allowed them to scapegoat Russia for all of their mistakes and problems. Secondly it allowed them to avoid talking about any of the contents of the emails and distract people from the corruption and nepotism of the DNC.

You're right, but Labour, lib dems, Ukip, Tories... It doesn't matter. The NHS is being slowly drained and privatised no matter which parliamentary party is at the helm. Labour might be a bit less brazen about it, but they'd still let their donors and sponsors pick at the last remaining flesh on the bones. Any politician who tries to be very vocal about re-nationalising private assets will find themselves butting heads with a very wealthy and powerful opposition along with their allies in the corporate media.\n\nWe must recognise that the political establishment is more beholden to corporate interests than to the interests of the public. That it does not represent the average person. That, no matter which party is in power, they will sell out the working class in order to protect themselves and their largest financial backers. Therefore the only way to secure the interests of the public is for the public to collectively wrest control of the state from this moribund political class and suppress the corporate interests in favour of public interests.\n\nA public demonstration, even in the form of "fannying about with a placard" is the first step in organising a mass mobilisation of the public in order to meet these aims. I agree with you, that peaceful protests are extremely easy for the government to ignore, and typically achieves very little. But a stronger, more united, and more militant movement can develop from this. A movement that successfully enacts a general strike, or an election boycott, or even threatens the very safety and security of the political establishment, can be an effective strategy at securing concessions from the government.\n\nHowever, again, it is limited in its usefulness. Once the heat dies down the government will try to remove those concessions. The only way to secure a complete victory is for the public to take control of the state and completely remove those who put the interest of private individuals and private entities above the well being of the general public.

Not a Fianna Fáil voter but frankly who the fuck would admit to that in this day in age?\n\nPut yourself in the position of a well off middle class individual. Your position has mostly "recovered" from the recession, you've got lots of your savings intact, you might even own a small property and rent it out - there are hundreds of thousands of landlords in this country. Economically speaking, what you're looking for from a government is political stability and tax cuts. \n\nLogically speaking then, you want to go with Fine Gael. Except they're not popular anymore with the proles and they can't maintain the strong government necessary for "economic stability" for your position in life to be maintained in a secure manner - just look at the public sector strikes, sure, if that's not instability then what is?! \n\nNow, FG's had 6 years in government, they've made a fair few political mistakes, they're clearly corrupt which is something you're not very happy with - so you don't want to vote for them. Who's your alternative? Sinn Féin - they're not reliable, and their history as the IRA turns you off. AAA-PBP? Load of commies. \n\nRealistically speaking, for someone in your position you're looking at two and only two parties which can form a government which you can hope to be stable, which also have more or less the same economic agenda. Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. \n\nAnyways, with that bit of roleplaying done, look at the polls now and compare it to the election results last year. FF+FG together are what, 5 or 6% up? The shift isn't really that big, it's mostly people who are shifting between FF and FG and then probably some from independents to FF-FG because, as we all know, a huge amount of independents are shitty FF'ers and FG'ers anyways so that a'int much of a leap.
Don't they maintain speaking rights for the period of this Dáil?
How would it erode their voting base whatsoever? If anything Irish unification would strengthen their voting base in Northern Ireland as the overriding issue there is the national question which sidelines the economic and social justice issues they base their politics on.
Yes, because water charges are totally the solution to deregulation of the enviornment and our emissions output??
More if you were to raise this concern with working class people they wouldn't throw a shit fit like you people here because we have *actual problems* that aren't centered around being an edgy fuck intent on offending people.
Households.
Simply put, if not protesting worked we wouldn't have this problem. Believe it or not, if you want things to change you have to campaign for it, and if state isn't on your side that includes protesting in order to put pressure on powers that be to take action, and if they don't then gaining the support necessary to take action yourself.
That is a completely bizarre rebuttal. If you deem things in the world acceptable based on cherry picking opinions from individuals of a particular group you can literally use that to justify anything.
Fucking Dreyfus Affair all up in here.
OBEY THE MARKET. IGNORE ALL KNOWLEDGE THAT IS NOT YET COMMODIFIABLE.
If "muscular" people want to make videos, go for it. Don't see the need to promote that specifically though. We're not about reinforcing masculinity - especially the toxic kind.
Our economic "development" model is a hilarious sham. A huge amount of our "growth" comes from economic activity that doesn't even happen in this country because companies HQ themselves here - not to mention inversions which lead to the absurd 26% growth figure last year. It's really a testament to the utility of propaganda that people still think this shit is working for us. \n\nThen we have the 13-19 billion euros that Apple owes us which could've employed every single worker currently employed by MNCs in this country if they all decided to up and leave for whatever bizarre reason.\n\nBut hey, FF-FG-LAB policies are "working", we've only had hundreds of thousands of people emigrate, massive economic crises which our country coped with by inflicting massive austerity so we could "take one for the team" and we're stumbling from one major social crisis to another. Mass homelessness, ridiculous rents, health service crisis, huge unemployment and massive amounts of precarious work and "working poor" - sure looks like your economic model is working out.
>They can be offended and ban him for it i dont care, its the fact that they are looking for anything to ban shacker with.\n\nOh so you're OK with racism if it's one of your victimised martyrs doing it? \n\n>And fuck off Cyridius, you tell neurodivergent/disabled people "we dont understand whats good for ourselves" if we use certain words, your ableist as hell.\n\nGrow up, remove your head from your ass, stop mansplaining, stop whitesplaining, *stop being a fucking brocialist* and stop deflecting. You've went from lecturing POC about the confederate flag to lecturing mentally ill POC about mental illness. \n\nI don't know why the mods allow you to hang around. 
No. That's something rabid Stalinoids who think the Moscow Show Trials were legit bother to believe in.
Any plans to do anything with Egypt?
Really? Huh, didn't think I'd done anything the admins would get me on. I'll go ask them.
I'm a "mod" on it, it's a private political discussion sub for Irish commies. Not particularly active but sometimes used.
Well yeah, it was started by a literal Neo-Nazi who thinks executing children is the solution to refugees. That was the point, get people in on a pretext then slap them with Fascist propaganda. It's how Fascists operate.
It did, consensus was that it didn't really matter that much, most people wouldn't make that connection, and it was a while ago in a different country.
I reject the libertarian-authoritarian dichotomy to begin with because it's fundamentally incoherent and idealist. \n\nIt needs to be kept in mind that Leninism is a post-October creation. The idea of a vanguard party in the Leninist sense was only universalised *after* the Bolshevik Revolution as a result of the lessons Lenin learned during the processes which unfolded. Believe it or not he didn't go into everything with a grand plan, much of what we understand as Leninism today are conclusions the Bolsheviks drew from observation of historical processes around the world, not from predetermined doctrinal practice. That is, they took a Marxist approach.\n\nThere's also no real contradiction between the broader vision set out by Lenin in *State and Revolution* and the practice of building a revolutionary party. The revolutionary party is the instrument which leads the working class to power, it itself is not the working class nor is it the workers' state. One party dictatorship was not a matter of principle for the Bolsheviks, it was something forced onto them by events, and so there would've been no reason for Lenin to write S&R with that in mind.
>The current mode of production in Rojava is what I'd consider Stalinism\n\nLike, ignoring that Stalinism isn't its own mode of production... How?
So you're operating under the *assumption* that the *vast, vast, vast* majority of this subreddit's userbase wont participate in your democracy in order for it to work?\n\nThat, firstly, sounds like a huge assumption to make, and secondly sounds extremely undemocratic. The current system is undemocratic but it's also efficient and it operates smoothly until a bunch of people get pissy about their anime or inability to use slurs.\n\nIt's the internet. On a forum where accounts can be made by the dozens with zero efforts or checks. With complete anonymity. What in the world makes you think anything about your proposed system is democratic? Democracy isn't just some abstract concept where voting occurs, the internet isn't the place for it.
It's good to be positively critical in a comradely manner - something that is lacking on much of the left. \n\nFrom what I hear SAlt has a good chance of winning their Minneapolis council race.
AYE
The model parliaments don't have nearly 80,000 users.
I read it as "fought for Hitler" for a second and I was like "Yeah no shit, I'd hide my medals if I was a Nazi, too"
> Supporting autocracy or any other authoritarian government\n\nInternet forums aren't governments. Get a grip.\n\n>is not even a semblance of democracy\n\nAs I said, it's undemocratic. I'm not ridiculous enough to think democracy is achievable in these conditions.
Get 50,000 signatures as opposed to, what, 70 signatures *after a month*, and maybe someone will take you seriously lol\n\nThe only people making anything a laughing stock are all the kiddies who stir up drama over every little issue. Do none of you have an actual life?
How is this appropriate for this sub?
You keep saying this over and over again but it's factually incorrect.\n\nFirstly, the AAA does not have a firm position on the national question(Except that it does not endorse the Good Friday Agreement). Saying that it has one is a position of ignorance.\n\nThe Socialist Party, which is a component of the AAA, has a position on the national question. That position is as follows;\n\nThe Socialist Party takes a position that states that moves towards Irish unity on a capitalist basis only divide working class people in the North and as such create conflict and sectarianism. \n\nNot only is this worse for working class people's lives, it also blocks the road to progressive class-based politics. So it is in favour of a united Ireland on the basis of an all-Ireland working class movement.\n\nIf it's not on that basis then it opposes moves towards it due to the divisiveness.\n\nIt is no surprise that as a nationalist you seek to distort the position for whatever political purposes you have. It's why you consistently misquote the Socialist Party's position on this issue - I know you used to be a Shinner but I thought you'd grow up a bit when you moved on and drop the Shinnerbot behaviour of repeating lies to muddy the water. More's the pity.\n\nThe Socialist Party wants a united Ireland, as part of a "united federation" of Ireland, Scotland, England & Wales - aye you got that. What you intentionally leave out, and it can only be intentionally, is that it's for a united federation of Ireland & Britain & *Europe as a whole*. Yes, shocker, Socialists want a European Socialist Federation. Who woulda thunk it?
It's completely fucked but a Gard's word is taken as fact in court.
Really countered what I was saying there, sure proved me wrong.\n\nJust drop the lies and move on with your life.
First and foremost, forget everything you think you know about Sinn Féin.\n\nThey're anti-left nationalists who are neoliberal in practice and extremely conservative in every single social movement, not to mention anti-abortion, religious sectarian etc. Some leftists internationally(By "some" I mean "American and a handful of British") fetishise Sinn Féin because they think they understand the Provisional IRA and Ireland's historical struggle for national liberation and against colonialism.\n\nConcretely there are two genuinely left wing forces in Ireland, the Anti-Austerity Alliance(AAA) and People Before Profit(PBP), both of which are broad-front organistions for the Socialist Party(SP) and Socialist Workers' Party(SWP) respectively who are Orthodox Trotskyist and Cliffite parties respectively. AAA & PBP are in an electoral/parliamentary alliance, the badly named AAA-PBP. In the 2016 elections they formed the first socialist parliamentary grouping in Ireland since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThere are the new centrist Social Democrats, who are stagnant and less than half the size of the Socialists. There's been several attempts at starting up right wing and fascist organisations but they've all thus far flopped. There's Sinn Féin who are capturing some of the anti-establishment sentiment but in reality are widely mistrusted by the Irish working class and did badly in the last elections - only going up a few percent when what they were expecting was to be in position to enter government.\n\nThe current situation, however, is one of a very precarious *de facto* Grand Coalition government of Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil, with Sinn Féin and AAA-PBP acting as the opposition(Though Sinn Féin at local council level often sides with the right wing). You also have a huge upswing in industrial action, particularly in the public sector, with significant gains made for workers. There was also an illegal police strike which resulted in concessions from the government as well. Across the board this has given confidence to working class people to take more militant action, and no doubt fed into the major housing occupation in Dublin over Christmas which resulted in dozens of homeless people getting housed.\n\nWhat's evident to even establishment pro-capitalist pundits is that the far left in Ireland is on the rise, and is in a far, far better position than any reactionary forces to take advantage of any openings in the situation. The establishment is quite scared and the politicians know their days are numbered. This has lead to them attacking left wing organisations, the AAA in particular, using the tools of the state - denying them the right to legally raise funds in all of their heartlands and putting several members and elected representatives of theirs on trial which could result in months if not years in prison. The media is of course playing its now-exposed role as the propagandists of the establishment, and people have little trust in what they say. That said, the trials will provide considerable coverage for the left and give us a good platform to get our ideas out there. We'll be at the center of Irish politics for weeks on end in trials that will be historic in nature.\n\nIn terms of the organisational state of Irish communism, AAA and PBP between us, along with some peripheral Marxist organisations like the Feminist activist group, ROSA(Also in the orbit of the SP) have several thousand members. Should a merger take place in the future(Not likely right now but also not off the table - I think the consensus is that the conditions need to be correct for such a move to make sense), the party that would come out of it would be one of the largest communist parties in Europe. \n\nThere's a general sentiment here that things are going to open up, and that there's a momentum to developments. Within the short-medium term it's not unlikely that a mass workers' party will form and take center stage in Irish politics. With the forces at play here on the Irish left, there's no reason for people internationally to critically support Sinn Féin as a lesser-evil, there's a genuine alternative which will be able to vie for power in the foreseeable future.
AYE
Decent folks all around - sub's in good hands
It's really a demographic thing. I'm very much pro-immigrant pro-refugee and I'm very far left to boot so I've got all sorts of ideas on how it can work, but certain sections of the population can be very anti-immigrant at times. \n\nThis anti-immigrant tendency isn't necessarily born out of malice or racism - it's the austerity the government has been pushing on us and causing crises in public services, coupled with our precarious low wage economy and housing crisis etc. It's very easy then for working class people to see that and want to protect themselves and their family's life by stopping people coming in and competing with them. \n\nStudents generally, as reflected in the Brexit vote in Britain, are not anti-immigrant because they don't have first hand contact with these issues(*Generally*). They, and other middle class people, make up the majority of this subreddit. Go out into wider society and it's not so clear cut - but it's not the culture/race war ideology that's motivating anti-immigrant views i.e. there are people out there against immigration but they're nothing like the Ireland4theIrish wanker that's running around this thread, for example.\n\nSo r/Ireland isn't necessarily representative of the entire country, but it is representative of a very significant layer of the country. Broadly speaking, even amongst the working class, people are sympathetic to the plight of refugees - they just have lots of questions on immigration which right wing governments like FG-LAB of FG-FF have been unable to answer, which has led to a conservatism on the issue. A progressive left alternative which put forward an answer to these questions would likely see a remarkable shift in favour of immigrants amongst the hard pressed sections of society.
You're thinking of this too individually. The Marxist critique of Capitalism is systemic and materialist - it isn't based on whether individual people are baddies or how successful or unsuccessful aspiring capitalists may be. \n\nIn reality, I'm far more critical of small businesses than larger ones. It's not because I think small business *owners* are bad people inherently, but because small businesses are frequently far more exploitative of what few workers they have, and the fact that larger workshops are better for organisational purposes because there are more workers concentrated in a single area.\n\nWith that in mind, there's the point to be made that our critique of businesses isn't based on whether or not your dad is treating his employees bad or good(Well paid workers is something *not* common amongst small businesses in general). It's based on the fact he has employees, and more importantly the existence of the private property relations which *enable* him to have a business start with, or even make him want to start one in the first place. The existence of businesses as we understand them is a facet of capitalist society.
Nobody's going to stop them making comics? Freedom of expression and speech - two things which hold absolutely no bearing here because we're not liberals - don't apply to banning people from forums.
Gendered slurs are gendered slurs no matter what your garbage excuse.\n\nStop covering yourself in the tricolour as an excuse for your misogyny. This Irish person isn't having your bullshit.
LOL Solidarity hardly hopped on the bandwagon. They were there at the very first water meter protests in local communities. They campaigned on it before anyone else. It was also their platform for the European elections at which time r/Ireland disparaged them for picking up "irrelevant issues".
>I do not understand the hatred towards us\n\nSomething to do with the campaigns of harassment, death threats, doxxing, brigades, and the continuous usage of homophobic, misogynistic and racial slurs?\n\n>like it or not we are fellow leftists\n\nCalling yourself left doesn't make you left. \n\nThe only reason I'm not clamoring for you brocialist fuckheads to be purged from this subreddit is because it's not practical to enforce.
Right but that has nothing to do with imperialism - like unless you distort the word beyond all meaning.
Oh yeah, your anecdote is definitely why the ethnic status of a minority shouldn't be recognised. \n\nFucking hell you people are like white supremacists crying about black people in the US. A complete lack of understanding of the law and an eagerness to use everything to reinforce your prejudice and hatred of a minority grouping.
You're telling POC if they should be offended over the usage of the Confederate flag.\n\nTake your head, right, make sure you've got a good grip, and pull *really* hard. Then it should be removed from your ass.
lol you literally support the Irish Social Democratic party against the Socialists.\n\nI'm happy that you're not feeling welcome here.
It's OK for you to admit that you're full of shit.\n\nSorry for referring to them by their name?
Hey, are you OK? Sounds like you're a bit angry that someone's called you out for having your head firmly lodged up your ass.\n\nGet a life outside of reddit. Then you get to be like actual Socialists who realise people like you are sad jokes.
>Are you cool with the rules? generally speaking\n\nWhich rules are you not supportive of?
r/@ is the last place any online leftist community should want to emulate. It's a complete drama machine filled with brocialists/manarchists, and all of their so-called "open" "democracy" occurs behind closed doors - again showing the absolute inability to have "democracy" on an open online forum where one person can have as many votes as they want if they put in the effort.
Frankly this whole situation brings into doubt anything the Garda & justice system have carried out in relation to whistleblowers, protests etc. given the clearly corrupt and political nature of their operation.
Right but I thought it was you only needed to start with 5, so say you get 5 people elected and one leaves so you're down to 4, I thought standing orders made it so you still kept your speaking rights until the next election?
That's a fucking massive margin.
And even then that's without a major party offering a progressive alternative which could allow for mass immigration. A party vying for government which wants to "open the floodgates" to refugees, if we're using that terminology, but also had concrete plans to resolve the housing & health crises and provide employment would probably see a big shift in support of immigrants because the things which play people off against immigrants - the fears around living standards - would otherwise be addressed.
>Trotskyism is essentially a socialist form of imperialism, for instance\n\nwut
Oppose on the basis of consistent use of slurs and refusal to self-crit.
Yes there is, there is the Social Democrats party which you [explicitly supported](http://imgur.com/a/otcqs) in arguments with one of the few socialists on r/Ireland against other socialist organisations. Don't lie - you'll always get caught out eventually.\n\nYou're a social democrat masquerading as radical, and a proven liar to boot - completely untrustworthy.
"I'm not a brocialist, I just hang around with tonnes of them and like forums filled with brocialist content. Totally different!"
Historically the left made one of two mistakes in relation to Fascism\n\n1. That Social Democracy was Fascist therefore the Nazis weren't a particular threat as we'd already lived through Fascism\n\n2. That Fascism was simply another form of bourgeois rule and was not particularly unique in any regard, therefore Mussolini and the Blackshirts were not a particular threat\n\nThe only position I've managed to read which puts forward a clear theoretical line coupled with workable praxis on the issue of Fascism is Trotsky's.
I find it amusing how you've been so caught out you've completely deflected from the topic onto something else. Classic Shinnerbot behaviour really.
>Boy, if only some of you here put it in your head to think for yourselves.\n\nWew here comes the up-your-own-ass condescension typical of brocialist types. \n\n>Maybe leftism and solidarity on the internet would become a thing.\n\n*He says while leading the charge to cause a split in the community over moderators take a Feminist stance on an issue*\n\n>But I'm glad that your best argument against this petition is baseless insults and calling me "garbage".\n\nFirstly, not baseless.\n\nSecondly, no the best argument is that you've been trying to peddle this petition for over a month and you've gotten nowhere. Not to mention the padding on your post is so shitty - you realise that you couldn't have had problems over "years" given this mod team has only been in place for a single year, right? You and this petition are as hilarious as you are pathetic. Which is to say, very.\n\n>You'll still be welcome here as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned you and all other leftypol dudebros can go get fucked.\n\n
Normalised slurs doesn't stop it being a slur.

There's a few points to be teased out on the issue and I think you're fundamentally approaching it from the wrong perspective. We need to win over working class people in a concrete sense, not win over liberals by pandering to their ideology. \n\nThe question then is how do we win over workers, not how do we argue effectively with liberal ideologues. The former is essential and useful political work, the latter is only useful if it aides the former. The battle to win over the masses is inextricably linked with the battle against liberal ideology, and therefore the attacking of liberal arguments and political ideology. \n\nConsequently our propaganda and our political programmes have to be geared towards the concrete needs of the working class - housing, jobs, social and economic justice more broadly. Putting forward a Marxist perspective on these issues means fundamentally rejecting the logic of liberalism - that of the markets and individualism. As such, in a practical sense you can't win over a liberal on their own terms to our politics.\n\nThere's a difference to be made here again, between the ideological liberals and those who have thus far accepted liberal ideology given to them by the capitalist state and media. The former are those who are committed to the tenets of capital, the latter are those who are won over in the process of struggle around issues that effect them and other events occuring in society that we can intervene into. \n\nSo if you're trying to get at "How can we convince the clerics of the free market to renounce their religion" - don't bother. If you want to get at "How can we win over ordinary working people" then put forward a principled socialist position on all issues of public concern, unapologetically, and organise with faith and optimism in the working class. 
Can they wait like 3 months? Then I'll have time for an election campaign. And it'll be summer.\n\nAnyways, a month ago if this was the situation I'd have said FF would stick it out. They want the 3 year deal so they can switch places with FG in good faith. But with Sinn Féin saying they'll do a dirty deal with literally anyone and FF high in the polls - they could decide now was a good time, they could form a coalition with SF.
Mate do you read like anything they put out? Budget statements, election manifestos, articles? They're filled with costed plans on how to achieve their policy aims and outlines of their ideas not to mention they are constantly putting forward legislation in the Dáil. The whole concept of "They do nothing but oppose!!" is based in less than nothing.\n\nAs for "unity", frankly Sinn Féin has as much in common with Solidarity as it does with Fine Gael. Two completely different political traditions with different political perspectives. Unity for unity's sake is basically a call for people to dump their political principles for opportunist power grabs - something people rightfully rage against and something Sinn Féin is happily in the process of doing on its own.
In addition to other recommendations, I would add Trotsky's [*The ABC of Materialist Dialectics*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/12/abc.htm) which is a short but good article. Written in the context of polemicising against people who were calling the USSR State Capitalist but if that politics isn't for you the first 2/3 of it are basically outlining the fundamentals of dialectics and it's very easy to read.
But the religious order which are responsible live on - and to this day block all attempts at justice and progress on the island.
This is simply incorrect. The position is exactly as stated - the main difference between the SP/AAA and SWP/PBPA as things currently stand is that the SP/AAA opposes moves towards unification until working class unity has been achieved, whereas SWP/PBPA does not(Though also does not actively campaign in favour). \n\nIt's a bizarre(i.e. intentional) misreading of their position to say they're in favour of joining the UK.\n\n/u/Clockwork16 
This conversation has pretty much been hashed out over and over again for the past 2-3 years and it's been pretty decisively shown that the government's plans for Irish Water were;\n\n1. Not driven towards conservation\n2. Would not have helped conservation\n3. Was a precursor to privatisation\n4. Which would've made access to water prohibitive for working class people\n5. Which means then as eco-*socialists* the left like AAA had to oppose it\n\nIf you wanted to help conservation the place you would've started was the place where the biggest loss of water was - which was not in the taps but in the infrastructure. \n\nAs has been shown repeatedly over the past number of years, the cost of infrastructure was nowhere near covered by the cost of charges, which was the stated aim of the charges.\n\nIf the stated aim of the charges was to provide funding in order to hit the biggest source of leakage, then it stands to reason you can raise those funds through general progressive taxation without carrying out the anti-poor and costly water charges programme.\n\nIf that is not the stated aim then the clear aim of the water charges was not raising funds to tackle the infrastructure problems(i.e. was not conservation), but to generate a source of future profits to be sold off. \n\nI don't know why this conversation is being revisited. The massive cock-up - from every angle - that was the water charges is done away with permanently if the trajectory of the commission is indicating anything. Thank god.
Checkpoints at the borders would just be an awful idea from the British perspective. It's like planting a giant neon sign saying "Republican dissidents attack here". And you can be sure that the mentality of Catholics in the North would shift if a border was thrown back up, to the point where dissidents could actually get some support, too.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how they handle it.
It's bizarre that you think SF wouldn't form a coalition government. The only thing that stopped them this time around is that they were too small to be the preferred partner for FF.
Most European countries, while gun ownership is not as restricted as Americans might think, don't have a gun culture. Fights happen with fists and melee weapons. Firearms usage has happened but is extremely rare. More importantly, we mostly don't take the individualist anarcho-hero approach to this shit and rely on collective organisation as opposed to some random leftie going out and buying a gun to live out their rambo fantasy. \n\nBash the fash and all, but if you're going to do it, do it tactically - with as many people as you can and in self-defence and occupy their spaces and with a conscious goal of building working class organisations.
>"They don't agree with me, must be a liberal."\n\nNo, it's more like holding liberal ideas makes you a liberal. There are plenty of people I don't agree with who aren't liberal. Like Fascists. Lots of other Communists. Not liberals though, they are liberal. Brocialism is liberalism because brocialists rely on liberal ideology to justify their worldview.\n\n>"They want democracy and don't lump people in groups, must be from /leftypol/."\n\nMeaningless statement.\n\n>I had no idea /leftypol/ existed before Thursday.\n\nFor someone who had no idea it existed you sure seem to be quick to its defence. It's almost like you're full of shit. \n\nStop trying to deflect from your shit arguments.
I'm Irish, that's just completely untrue. That it's socially pervasive does not mean it is not a gendered slur.
>Government is the "controlling or regulating of a nation, state, or community."\n\nYeah except that happens in the real world. You know, not on the internet?\n\n>Both have democratic systems.\n\nBoth are shitholes filled with brocialists and pedophiles. If you want their system go post there, don't export it and fuck up everywhere else.\n\n>Also, couldn't the same be said by workers? They can't achieve democracy, so don't try?\n\nYeah, because *the internet* is equal to real life. This comment is quite telling actually, you have no connection to politics outside of shitposting on the internet. It's all an abstract little game to you.
>Worker co-ops are not a capitalist enterprise. They get rid of the capitalist\n\nThe exploitative relationship is between *capital* and labour, not capital*ists*. Capitalists only personify that relationship, they are not it in of themselves. \n\nThe market system, competition, accumulation of capital, wage labour, and *commodity production*(The core aspect of capitalism as outlined by Marx in Chapter 1 of Capital Vol I) are all still functions of a cooperative enterprise or even an entirely cooperativised economy. \n\nIt's also why "Market Socialism" is a completely oxymoron - the existence of a market economy necessitates the existence of capital and commodity production. Whilst the elimination of capitalists would indeed by a progressive move, let's not fool ourselves into thinking that's the end goal.
>Trots are generally considered part of the tankie continuum\n\nlol only by ultralefts who nobody cares about except on the internet anyways.
>AAA (Socialist Party) are anti-unification. (Well, actually, their position is in favour of union with Britain.)\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\nThe Socialist Party has a position of unification on the basis of Socialism, it is not an anti-unification party. \n\nWith regards to being in favour of unifying with Britain, that's just something Republicans say to smear them. Hypothetically, they're in favour of a confederation of socialist republics some time far into the future, not us joining the UK.
Nope, the Bon Secours sisterhood is still alive and well and runs several of our hospitals, turning a handy millions in profit a year.\n\nI have a good idea what we can do about that. (Hint: Take all hospitals from religious orders.)
I get the impression that people may think you're referring to TheAmazingAtheist.
We need another Rosa Luxemburg
Well, as a member of an active, albeit small chapter of CPUSA in a small town, I could argue speculatively that, yes, there could potentially be some hope, if there were any real desire to transform the party. Its core is comprised of very old comrades that are getting more and more desperate to retire, as far as I can tell. There is a very real danger in the party that if its senior members do not pass the torch soon, that it could literally fade into oblivion because there isn't enough competent, driven membership to keep it going. If the right members were to join the ranks, and shake up the national councils, I'd say that there is a hollow space that is ripe for filling with new blood.\n\nHaving said that, the real question to ask is, *do we want to revive it*? Today, we see that there are already plenty of other left parties that are doing very well such as PSL or SAlt. We could maybe restore revolutionary spirit to CPUSA, and revive it into what it could be, but that effort might be better spent in these parties that already have some traction and movement.

His criticism of the publishers is a criticism of the ruling class's role in video games, which is inherently very anti capitalist, whether he realises it or not
Extortion/exploitation as a concept has nothing to do with ethics/morals.\n\nThe socially necessary labor of a casino is the time it took to build the casino, to build the machines inside it, and the time it takes the workers to operate the various gambling tables, and to maintain these things.
I'm willing to unite with anyone that is consciously anti capitalist. This does not include socdems. 
I would suggest that it's just a poor stance to take in the argument. self-employed people don't survive for long, and self-employment isn't an option for the vast majority. It in of itself is probably relatively non-exploitative (citation needed) but when we're discussing capitalism, we're looking at the organization of the system on a societal level. There is virtually no labor that isn't social, and small outliers such as self-employed people carry virtually no gravity in the system as a whole. Having said that, self-employed people assist in perpetuating the rest of the system, just like everyone else, which is exploitative. So, there's that.
>I mean...in my mind socialism is\n\nOh, so like, things in the world are just whatever we think they are?\n\n>im not sure what socialism means\n\nThis is obvious.
I wish he had brought capitalism more front and center as the cause of these issues that Tucker Carlson was bringing up during the interview, otherwise I thought he did a great job.

There are many types of work beyond simply physical labor. Communists aren't only in favor of manual laborers, but of all workers that are subjugated by capital, including intelligence-workers. Just because machines will make lifting things easier doesn't at all mean that our labor will simply cease. There's an entire universe out there that demands our labor to expose its secrets.
Serj is still pretty cool, as far as I know.

Well, capitalism is leading us on the path to rendering our planet uninhabitable for humans, which would render inputs and outputs nil, so there's that.
Words. What do they mean?
>Something to the effect of "Capitalism didn't make anything, labor did. As it does in all -isms."\n\n>What does that mean? Are you telling me Joe the factory worker is responsible for the development of modern day advancements in technology?\n\nIn this case not a factory worker necessarily, but more likely a scientist or engineer - who are also workers. However, more specifically, knowledge and the capabilities of our physical world exist regardless of the economic system. The economic system only affects who is afforded the means to take the time to explore reality.\n\n>What value did that worker actually provide that helped to bring the creation to life,\n\nWell, after the science of something is discovered, it requires other workers to materialize it into reality. So, to put it simply, all workers take part in the value-creation process.\n\n>the more self talk I have about it the less sense it makes to me.\n\nTalk less to yourself about it, read more.
Seriously, like, how diluted to be like, "Well, it's like capitalism, it has all of the characteristics of capitalism, but it isn't capitalism."

I think your analysis is pretty excellent, and obviously you may be the only person on youtube doing this sort of analysis. I'd absolutely love to see more. The only criticism I have is that your voice and the sound effects of the game are in conflict, and it was difficult to hear what you were saying at times.
Unfortunately I couldn't find it when I looked for it again, sorry
>political and economic control belong to the people via socialist economy and direct democracy\n\nYes, generally "authoritarian socialists" desire this as well. What exactly is your question?
*Socialism* in one country.\n\nIt's an important distinction to be made. Stalin understood that Communism was stateless, and therefore, would be paradoxical to say that it could exist "in one country".
With a great anti-capitalist message behind it, to boot.
Good video, thanks for making this and sharing!
Abby Martin and Chris Hedges are great. I agree with what Chris has to say quite a bit.

A major difference between Paine and liberals of today is that Paine was a revolutionary that wasn't afraid of violence. I can't say much else on the subject aside from that.

Communists do not advocate for a world where everyone receives the same income, nor for a world where everyone gets the same thing that everyone else is.
Pacifism enables violence against the oppressed. We are already under violent attack on a daily basis, the reluctance to use violence to defend ourselves only hurts ourselves. Abusers are not victims.

It only appears to be a minimalist, austere, and puritanical society because your idea of 'need' is minimalist, austere, and puritanical.\n\n'Need' as a concept enters into society at large from the mind of the bourgeois. Of course, from the bourgeois perspective, they don't want us proles to see things that are beyond the bare minimum for survival as 'needs'. Nevermind what we might need to realize our full potentials as temporary living beings.\n\nEdit: to address your question a little more directly: if we were to take Marx's words as dogma, Marx was very explicit, he envisioned a society that was abundant in leisure and luxury.

Well, while some of your rhetoric could use some critique (which I can already see in the rest of the comments is well under way), I don't think your idea is entirely without merit. There is almost certainly a host of fence-dwelling  potential comrades that might be more receptive to our message if it were delivered by someone such as [Jeff Monson](https://i2.wp.com/recomposition.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Web_Jeff-Monson.jpg).\n\nHopefully after some introduction to leftist political economic theory, they would be more receptive to the broader idea, and less reliant on bourgeois conceptions of femininity vs masculinity, and be capable of learning further from other revolutionaries.

Neither, I suppose. I'm pro workers, so I appreciate and support professors and the general work that 'intelligence-workers' do, but don't really care much for the institution of universities, Deans, and their purportedly elevated position in capitalist society.\n\nLearning and progress go hand-in-hand and should never cease, and so hopefully in that way, learning institutions would flourish in socialism, but would not retain the socially dividing property that they have today.
Kshama Sawant wrote an [article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/may-day-general-strike-trump-international-womens-day/) advocating for a general strike this May 1st.

I don't know enough about Juche to really dispute it on its own. However, if the intended result is anything like the status of North Korea, then it cannot possibly be anything other than thinly-veiled red fascism.

Thanks! And yeah, my brother did something similar with Penn State. I'll definitely keep my options open.
Certainly not communism, jfc. This is like those people who think Nazis were socialists because they had the word socialist in their name.\n\nFascism, as practiced by the Nazis, as well as the form practiced by most other fascist countries, was a form of capitalism centered not around liberal ideology, but rather one known as corporatism. The relation of people to their production was about the same, though. Just because the state held a lot of power under Lenin and Hitler does not mean the economic, political, or ideological forces were at all the same. \n\nThis is a dangerous, ignorant comparison to make, and you are entirely wrong to make it.
Lol so many questions, and they're all trying to justify not giving people a basic human necessity. 
No, the guy who wrote volumes on how much he hated Stalin and Nazis was neither a supporter of Stalin nor Nazis, believe it or not. 
Nevermind the fact that it *has* worked at a significant scale several times in the past, what exactly do you think anarchism is?
This seems like it would really be best for people that are already class-conscious, but on the fence about socialism. Maybe its just me, but in my liberal days I probably wouldn't readily accept that the Holocaust was caused by Capitalism, so that argument needs to be made as well.

I hope I speak for everyone when I say that I'd rather live in a liberal democracy than an impoverished dictatorship. The way it stands now, NK could\n1. Continue existing\n2. Somehow revert back to capitalism\n3. Have another revolution that creates an actual socialist democracy\n\nObviously (3) is preferable, but (1) and (2) are the most likely IMO, and I'd rather have (2) than (1).\n\nEdit: also, I think it's a stretch to say that SK is as bad as NK, at least now a days. An example of the results of imperialist meddling and typical corporate behavior taken to a rather extreme level it is, but it's no NK.
No, it seems you misunderstood my comment, or I didn't articulate my point well enough. The "oppressor" is not a specific person or group of people. It is the aforementioned systems and institutions that have ingrained themselves in our society. \n\nAre you really trying to argue that there is no oppression in society? That everyone is either successful, or lazy? Obviously that isn't true.
Yeah I'm honestly not following this discussion too well, it seems like everyone is talking about a different thing. I just wanted to clarify that Sanders is technically not a Democrat, despite his affiliation with them.

>OK let me explain this to you as if I were 4 year old:\n\nFTFY\n\n>B. People seem to struggle with comprehending even my oversimplifications, why elaborate more? \n\nBecause your oversimplifications are incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of Leninism you give is a actually an analysis of Marxism as a whole, and the analysis of Marxism you give is not true. Every Marxist acknowledges the successes of Capitalism and the necessity of industrial and technological development before socialism or communism can be achieved. \n\nYour analysis of communism is also incorrect. I suggest you look up the definition of [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism?wprov=sfla1), and you will see that a one-party authoritarian state in which industry is nationalized is objectively not communist, or even socialist, despite what supporters of those states may claim.\n\nAnd how you manage to relate this all back to fascism is a leap of logic worthy of a medal. Because both fascism and communism are ideologies created in response to discontent with liberalism, they are the same? Seriously? Nevermind the completely different systems of production, distributions of power, ideological justifications -- no, because they both rely on a preexisting capitalist order, they are both the same. Fucking dumbass.\n\n>A. This is crap I stopped thinking about\n\nThat is very clear. 
That's the one I was thinking of, but I couldn't remember.

Bernie Sanders isn't a Democrat, he just ran as one for president. He's still an independent.
Cory Booker seems to be gaining a lot of traction as a DNC leader. As a person from his state and someone who isn't tone-deaf to popular moods, I find it appalling that a Clintonite Third-Way Democrat is somehow becoming more and more popular even after the election. The fact that many Democrats in my state, as well as throughout the country, are calling for him to run for president in 2020 proves that liberals learned fucking nothing from this election.

That reminds me a bit of the debate between formalism and, well, non-formalism. I read an essay by David Foster Wallace (can't remember the name) that talked about how literature is fundamentally a sort of conversation between the author and the audience. I don't necessarily agree that a reading of a book should rely on the author, but it's important not to de-contextualize where context adds meaning, which you don't need to agree with.

I've found Jacobin to be a good interpretation of news, but they don't really provide any news. Sometimes they explain the context of their articles a bit, but it's usually the case that you need to know a bit of background on the topic of the article to understand it. In that regard, though, it's really good at doing that.
One thing I didn't expect about this book that I really liked was how funny it is. Seriously, Trotsky was a hilarious writer sometimes, and the burns he laid on liberals and compromisists were amazing. \n\nAlso I don't know anything about Russian, but Max Eastman must have done a very good job translating, because this book is very prosaic. \n\nEdit: I do disagree, however, that Trotsky takes a 'neutral' position. I can't think of any 'neutral' historic work about the Russian Revolution. He explains in the prologue that his work is not neutral, but that's the point. Neutrality in times of revolution is counterrevolutionary, is essentially what he wrote.  
That seems like it's not so much a condemnation of knowledge and wisdom as a belittlement of human knowledge in comparison to god's. Essentially reinforcing the omnipotence of god.
Then can someone explain why I was just recently given a permanent ban from FC?\n\nI engaged in a discussion with someone who was claiming that the DPRK was a success of socialism, who stated: "sounds like a fucking awesome place to live if you ask me," and as a result I was given a 3 day ban for breaking the jerk. Understandable, and I kind of saw it coming.\n\nWithin that span, though, I was then given a permanent ban. I'm curious how I could have possibly broken any sub rules while being banned from participating in the sub.\n\nIf you could enlighten me I would greatly appreciate it. 
>In fact, anarcho-monarchism would actually not be much different than the standard anarcho-capitalist vision itself\n\nYuck

 >I had the privilege to hear him speak at my campus in the early 90s.  He was getting on in years even then, but he was very engaging and open.  I don't think he would be supportive at all of this ridiculous protesting based on hate. \n\nKurt Vonnegut was a socialist, so he would without a doubt disagree with almost all of your comment.
I just did. Capitalism. Anarchism proposes that it be replaced with an economic system in which productive property is collectively owned, and all illegitimate hierarchies would be abolished. \n\nThis is not a pipe dream, it has been done in the past, and is to an extent being done right now in the Chiapas region of Mexico by the Zapatistas, though they are meeting obvious resistance from the Mexican government. There's also Rojava, but they are currently engaged in the Syrian Civil War, so currently that's not too good an example. \nEdit: both are examples of collective property ownership working, though. 
>This same shit happened in the 20s and 30s, between socialists and social democrats most notably, it made the left vulnerable then and it's no better now. If we can't unify I fear for the future.  \n\nI agree with you, but on the other hand why should anyone compromise with social democrats, when they would continue the existence of capitalism? Obviously if a socialist is to vote in a bourgeois election, compromise is a must, but when the chips are down, history has shown us where social democrats stand.   \n\nEdit: and this logic extends to other leftist tendencies as well. They just seem irreconcilable to me.    
Clearly people don't love her enough if her or an old billionaire racist was a toss up. 
I was just trying to clarify that the distinction between 'fascist' and 'not quite fascist' is not as clear cut as may appear on this sub, and I fear the word is overused here to describe any sort of right-wing movement, and even liberals, sometimes. \n\nWhether the U.S. may be considered fascist or not is a point of debate. I think you may be right though in saying that some elements of the Republican Party lean in the direction of fascism, and that needs to actively be countered, both rhetorically and physically, since this now poses a far greater threat than in the recent past. 
There are a variety of opinions on exactly how a system can be classified as 'fascist,' within the realm of academic debate. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/22ox1w/what_is_fascism/?sort=confidence) is a very good write-up on the subject by /u/depanneur, a mod of /r/AskHistorians:\n\n>Fascism is a hard ideology to define because nearly every modern government or political movement has been called 'fascist' by somebody. I contend that fascism was a political movement unique to the early 20th century, especially in Europe, because its worldview was shaped by events and philosophical ideas from the late 19th century until the interwar period. Some people have called states like Saddam Hussein's Iraq 'fascist', but I believe that there is a big difference between authoritarian dictatorship and genuine fascism.\n\n>So how did fascism originally develop? It grew out of a European intellectual movement which criticized the alienating effect that industrial society had on modern man, as well as late 19th century critiques of Liberalism and Positivism. They believed that industrial society robbed men of their individuality; however they wanted to assert it at the same time. These ideas were adopted by many young people, especially young, middle-class socialists, because they wanted to rebel against what they perceived as pointless and archaic bourgeois morality and conformity. This is why in the 1930s, fascism looked like it might actually take over Europe: it successfully harnessed people’s dissatisfaction with modern society and directed it into political channels. \n\n>Fascists were influenced by philosophers like Gustav Le Bon who wrote about the need for a strong leading figure to lead the masses against social ills. He believed that people were fundamentally irrational, and should embrace their irrationality. This was taken up by fascist ideologues who thought that their members’ irrationality should be harnessed by the leader and directed into political action, which was mostly comprised of beating up socialists, communists and trade unionists (or Jews in the case of Nazism). Fascism was a fundamentally violent ideology which praised war and conflict. Both Hitler and Mussolini believed that war was the highest expression of human ability and society, and sincerely thought that life was a continual conflict between people for limited resources (hence the title of Hitler's autobiography, Mein Kampf). To fascists war was a good thing because it let nations or races decide who was the strongest and who deserved the planet's resources. \n\n>Fascism’s insistence on embracing irrationality is one thing that makes it hard to comprehend; although Hitler and Mussolini wrote their respective handbooks about fascist beliefs, they ultimately rejected concrete doctrines and always acted in response to current events. This is why a lot of fascist rhetoric and actions seem to be contradictionary. \n\n>The First World War gave fascism its mass base. Veterans across Europe felt alienated in civilian society after the war, which could not understand their experiences on the frontline. A lot of them wanted to return to an idealized comradeship and hierarchy of the front line, which fascist organizations like the SA and the Blackshirts offered. A lot of them didn’t actually care about the nuances of fascist ideology, they just felt like they didn’t belong in civilian society and needed order and comrades. Instead of a real enemy opposing army, fascism offered them a frontline against post-war society which was especially attractive in revisionist countries like Germany and Italy, where many wanted to destroy the existing Liberal order which they blamed for their countries’ humiliations.\n\n>Unlike socialists and communists, fascists wanted to cure modern society’s alienation through the creation of a hierarchal state made up of different social classes working together for the benefit of the nation. This is called ‘corporatism’ and is fascism’s only real contribution to economic thought. The competing segments of industrial society would be united by the leader act entirely through the state, which incidentally would preserve existing capitalist hierarchies and strengthen them. Fascists were for a sort of inverted social-democracy which would give social services to its members but not to anyone else. If you were not a member of the nation or the Volksgemeinschaft - tough luck. This is why many people participated in Fascist and Nazi organizations like the DAP or Hitler Youth; if you did not actively participate in the national or racial community, you were not a part of it and would be socially ostracized (or worse) and denied state benefits. They didn't necessarily believe in fascist ideology, and many opposed it, but the fascist state required them to participate in it.\n\n>The major difference between fascism and socialism is that the former was all about preserving hierarchy and bourgeois society, while getting rid of industrial alienation through the creation of a totalitarian society. Mussolini thought that by giving up your individuality to the totalitarian state, you could have your energies and efforts multiplied by its services. Paradoxically, by surrendering individuality, alienation would somehow disappear. In industrial societies, fascism was popular with the middle class because it offered a cultural and social revolution which would keep hierarchies and fortify them through corporatism. Unlike conservatism, fascism wanted a cultural revolution that would create a “New Fascist Man” who had no individuality separate from the state. This is why it was appealing to the middle class; it let them vent their frustrations about modern society and be little revolutionaries while simultaneously protecting their property and position in the social hierarchy.\n\n>The emphasis on maintaining private property and hierarchy was what made fascists hate socialists and communists. Fascism marketed itself as the “Third Way” between Liberalism, which was responsible for alienation and the post-war Wilsonian order, and Socialism, which threatened to take bourgeois property in an economic revolution. Conservatives and fascists usually got along because they both hated the same things, but most conservatives failed to understand the revolutionary aspect of fascism and believed they could be controlled to curtail workers’ rights and revise the Paris Treaties, which didn't really work out.    
He was far from perfect. He has about the most cutting leftist critique of the USSR, though, and was all around a very good writer. Anarchists generally hate him, however, for his violent crushing of anarchist movements in Russia, as well as the sapping of power away from the soviets and toward the Party. This is more a criticism of just about every Bolshevik, though.
That's exactly right, but it still goes against the ideology of those spineless liberals who would invoke MLK's pacifism as proof that, for instance, BLM should just shut up and let the ruling class give them just enough to live on.

You clearly have no idea what Leninism is. \n\n>They hated communists for political reasons, doesn't mean they didn't absolutely institute Leninism. \n\nThis is so stupid it practically drools. Leninism and Nazism are on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum. I don't support Leninism, but don't go equating it with Nazism, that's just horseshoe theory on steroids. 
The same exact thing happened to me, pretty much word-for-word.\n\nIdk how to use imgur but the response I got from terran117 was \n\n>HOLD IT. So, there may be a way to prove you ain't leftypol as per the head mod:\nGo to leftypol, give them your username, and tell them to go fuck themselves, and let them know you will be happy to see them all on the wall.\nThen message the petition creator and ask them to remove your name from the petition. It kinda sucks if you want reform I know, but leftypol ruined it.\n\nWhen I explained that I have never used 4chan, or really anything other than reddit, and that a cursory glance of my comment history shows an over-abundance of leftist agitprop, bad-cop mod voteanimal2012 shows up and says:\n\n>We don't want 8chan scum posting here, you refused to cut ties with 8chan, so yeah, it does have everything to do with FC.\n\n\nI am now apparently 8chan scum. \n\nThey even had the gall to send me off with:\n\n\n>If you are true and red, then maybe try complete anarchy, it ain't small and you can post there.  
It's not really anything personal, I just don't like the idea of /r/soc mods becoming a preponderance of /r/fullcommunism mods. I'm not really a fan of the moderation there, and I would prefer not to see it carried over to here, despite how much that has already occurred (I believe the subs share 2 mods now, and in this thread alone about 5-6 FC mods have applied).\n\nThat being said, I'm also not too comfortable with anyone connected with [this](http://archive.is/OQ1EK) becoming a mod, so I guess it is kind of personal. Sorry. 
That's the same argument people use to oppose anti-fascism
Probably Stalinist propaganda? He wrote several pamphlets about how he though fascism ought be combatted, the guy was plainly no supporter of Nazis. The only people who said otherwise were Stalin and his supporters. 
You acknowledge that there is oppression in America, yes? This oppression includes, but is certainly not limited to, the oppression of patriarchal society over women, the oppression of systemic poverty over the poor, and the oppression of minorities by systemic racism. All of these things are intertwined and are necessary aspects of our current economic system. \n\nTo an anarchist, this extends to the oppression and exploitation of employers over employees, and ultimately of the state apparatus over citizens of a nation.\n\nModerates can often be seen to uphold and defend these systems, sometimes out of ignorance, and sometimes out of benefit from those systems, often a mix of both. People tend not to intentially ignore oppression, but they very often do, and when confronted about it they tend to have pretty malicious ways of justifying their belief that oppression does not exist. \n\nUltimately, this is not limited to moderates. Liberals and conservatives are as guilty. Conservatives will try to justify oppression, and liberals will believe that the system can be reformed to no longer include oppression, which has historically never been possible. \n\n>First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season."\nShallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\n- Martin Luther King Jr.

I'm not sure why you're trying to spin this quote, because MLK was a socialist, and was thus opposed to the existence of capitalism. \n\nEdit:\n> Everything has its good and bad the problem starts the moment you go extreme. \n\nFuck off with this horseshoe theory nonsense.
Honestly this is a point that wasn't really brought up during the whole /r/socialism debacle, and it's a much more convincing reason I think. Idk, something about recognizing that as much as this feels like an internal monologue, it's actually content viewable by anybody, and we should conduct ourselves accordingly. 
Oppose
What are you talking about? Are you saying all the workers in the world just got together in some room and decided to get together and start the industrial revolution? Your comment is entirely ahistorical.
> To people with limited intelligence, maybe. But, even if you were correct, wouldn't you be more wise going after the "oppressor"? \n\nTheir point is that, since 'moderates' choose the side of the oppressors, they are helping them, and so moderates have as much potential for harm as an oppressive institution by their virtue of supporting that institution.
I agree that a great deal of propaganda has added to the Western perception of socialist states, but this isn't the Truman Show, and not literally everything bad you hear about North Korea is a lie. It is an objectively awful place to live, and any 'socialist' who thinks it is an exemplar of anything other than a government unworthy of existence is not a socialist.\n\nAnd again, I don't want to get banned or anything, and this is more tangential than my larger point, but if your class domination of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie does not give the workers complete control over production and the product of their labor, then you don't have socialism. If you think a state ought to exist, then I can agree. But unelected leaders can fuck off into a noose.    
Haha lol Karl Marx wuz a fucken idiot amirite?? Good job refuting his theories, though, you're a regular Ayn Rand

The sons of liberty was created at around the same time as the implementation of the Stamp Act in 1765, and they were a well-organized movement that committed various acts of violence against British tax agents and other governmental fogures, and widespread subversion of British laws occurred by this time. \n\nThough you're right, revolutionary potential was pretty low by this point. I just think it's not a good idea to look to a vanguardist revolution that was pushed for by an aristocratic bourgeoisie as exemplar of any praxis we should be following now.
That wasn't even my account, I just saw the picture on /r/completeanarchy one time.\n\nThat being said, you did ban me for literally no other reason than signing the /r/soc petition, and called me "brocialist channer scum," despite me not being a brocialist or a 4chan user. I don't think that sort of unconfirmed, vile slander is befitting of a /r/soc mod, or even a decent human being for that matter.\n\nBut like elsewhere, your slandering of users who don't like you (in this case the anonymous user you banned in the pic) is entirely unsubstantiated.           
>Prisons are not concentration camps\n\nThe quotes were from Wikipedia, but the existence of the camps is [well documented](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/north-korea-un-report/). \n\n>The Kims did not betray the people and the people of the DPRK are statistically happy, just as the people of the USSR were under Stalin. You think they'd be so happy if every aspect of their constitution was being ignored?\n\nAccording to whom, exactly, are the North Korean people 'happy'? What metric would that survey use? Satisfaction with their government? Would those surveys be administered with the presence of governmental minders, who always accompany visitors to North Korea? Can you see how that would be a problem? \n\nPropaganda aside, articles like [this one](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9191998/What-North-Koreans-really-think-of-Kim-Jong-un.html), on top of the existence of over 30,000 defectors in SK alone, together point to the exact opposite conclusion.\n\n>They have had a single famine in their history, 1993-1996.\n\nOk, but food shortage is still a major problem there. They are emphatically not self-reliant at all, and rely on the very imperialist nations the Kims decry.\n\n["Escaped North Koreans reported in September 2010 that starvation had returned to the nation. North Korean pre-school children are 3 to 8 cm (1.2 to 3.1 inches) shorter than South Koreans. Roughly 45% of North Korean children under the age of five are stunted from malnutrition"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine&ved=0ahUKEwjegvmni77RAhVJvhQKHQWiACcQFggcMAE&usg=AFQjCNFJjeLab4bQxFU-4IejYJEIfTMjlA)\n\n>Again. The people of Korea are happy with their government. They are not miserable.\n\nYou're literally buying into North Korean propaganda.\n\n>How so? In your mind my supporting socialism in Korea and the Korean people makes me useless to the cause of the working class. That's some fucking mental gymnastics.\n\nBecause authoritarianism is not in the interests of the working class. It doesn't take any mental gymnastics at all to look at the way the North Korean state has hijacked the worker's movement and eliminated democracy to conclude that that is not ideal, nor is it in line with any sort of socialism worth pursuing. \n\nNorth Korean 'socialism' is not socialism. The people do not control the means of production or the product of their labor. \n\n>Lol the irony is is that the Taean Work System is more anarchist than anything any supposedly anarchist state has done. \n\n"Anarchist state" is an oxymoron. Nothing about North Korea is anywhere near anarchism. You'd have to be deluded for that idea to make any sort of sense.       
Where does the value come from when a robot makes something? Is it just the labor used to make the robot? If so, why does our society ascribe so much value to things produced with little labor/much automation?
I'd be amazed if the IWW felt they had the luxury of denying people membership, given how small they are.
What was your comment about? Can't see it since it was removed.
I feel like that might just let the funniest people become mods, or at least people who make the most generally agreeable comments. This does not reflect on whether they would abuse power or not.
I agree somewhat with Orwell's larger point, but I think to an extent some of what he suggests would have the effect of dumbing down writing, e.g. "Never use a long word where a short one will do."\n\nI guess I subscribe more to the David Foster Wallace [view](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/05/david-foster-wallace-dictionary-writing/),\n\n>One measure of how good the writing is is how little effort it requires for the reader to track what’s going on. For example, I am not an absolute believer in standard punctuation at all times, but one thing that’s often a big shock to my students is that punctuation isn’t merely a matter of pacing or how you would read something out loud. These marks are, in fact, cues to the reader for how very quickly to organize the various phrases and clauses of the sentence so the sentence as a whole makes sense.\n\n[…]\n\n>The point where that amount — the amount of time that you’re spending on a sentence, the amount of effort — becomes conscious, when you are conscious that this is hard, is the time when college students’ papers begin getting marked down by the prof.\n\n[…]\n\n>One of the things that really good writing does is that it’s able to get across massive amounts of information and various favorable impressions of the communicator with minimal effort on the part of the reader.\n\nThis doesn't mean we should shy away from using less widely-understood language, as it can be more descriptive of what a writer is trying to communicate. \n\nI think in the end, you just have to know your audience.        
The worst thing about my applying to most of my schools in late Nov.-early Dec. is how late I'm going to hear back from them (got wait listed from one, for 5 others I'm in the dark) while my friends have all heard back from the majority of their schools. Also most of the schools I applied to are fairly large, so that factors in as well. It's good to know though that based on this thread I'm not alone in being stressed the fuck out in late February unsure if I'll get into any of my top choices.

Nazis implemented Leninism? Are you high?
I was just curious because I saw an /r/askhistorians post that said that LTV is mostly discarded/refuted by economists now a days, and I was wondering what connotation this would have on Marxism as a whole. Admittedly I'm not well read on Marx's works at all.
Lefts with two completely different goals, though. It's essentially two completely different responses to capitalism: revolution vs. reform. While there are some things the two groups agree on, eg. this system is bad, they disagree on just about any way to fix it, with the exception of democratic socialists, who seek to establish socialism using non-revolutionary methods.
I just see two removed comments at the bottom, ones at around -35, the other at around -60 or so.
My comment was too long, so here's the rest:\n\nThis would suppose that fascism as it has existed cannot exist today, and is one of the stricter definitions of fascism that, in response to your question, would make the United States not a fascist entity. However, a looser definition of it is also used; one which would be applicable to several modern nations, possibly including the United States. Dr. Lawrence Britt characterized fascism [thusly](http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm):\n\n>\nDr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:\n \n>1. **Powerful and Continuing Nationalism** - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n \n>2. **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights** - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n \n>3. **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause** - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n \n>4. **Supremacy of the Military** - Even when there are widespread\ndomestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n \n>5. **Rampant Sexism** - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n \n>6. **Controlled Mass Media** - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n \n>7. **Obsession with National Security** - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n \n>8. **Religion and Government are Intertwined** - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n \n>9. **Corporate Power is Protected** - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n \n>10. **Labor Power is Suppressed** - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n \n>11. **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts** - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n \n>12. **Obsession with Crime and Punishment** - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n \n>13. **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n \n>14. **Fraudulent Elections** - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\nThis definition could certainly be taken to interpret the United States government and society as fascist, as it does fulfill most, if not all, of these quotas. Ultimately, it depends on how you define fascism: as a phenomenon specific to the first half of the twentieth century, or as a product of material conditions that can be, and have been, repeated. This latter view, commonly embraced by Marxists, sees the petty bourgeoisie as an agent for fascist power, and is the one I find myself aligning more with. Leon Trotsky wrote about this more generally applicable definition in [*Fascism: What It Is and How To Fight It*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm#p1), which I strongly recommend everyone read.\n\nTo answer your question with my own opinion based largely on these sources: no, I do not believe that the United States is fascist. It most certainly has the potential to be, especially in light of recent electoral results. I don't believe, though, that we are witnessing the 'death grips of the bourgeoisie,' so to speak.\n\nMoreover, I think we must be careful in our use of the word 'fascist', that we might overuse it and weaken it's power, thereby causing us to be less capable of identifying actual fascist regimes; also making us look ignorant in the face of most of the U.S. population, who would support the U.S. government. This isn't to say we shouldn't call out fascism when we see it, just that we ought to have a convincing argument when we do so. Fascism or bourgeois regime, it's intolerable all the same.  
Comrade, thank you for writing that survey. Doing it twice a year is great! I think we can safely conclude that we must reach out to women and make this more woman-friendly. I don't know where to begin, but if we are to lift up the lives of the proletariat, one of the key starting points are women. \n\nWith regards to the survey - great job, and excellent initiative. We need these kind of demographic analysis so we can be responsive to each others' needs. There were a lot of specifics though, that some I simply know nothing about. I can't be the only one. Perhaps add "I don't know enough to have an informed opinion" as an option in future surveys. Speaking of which, can someone provide me some links of the many people asked about in the survey?\n\nAgain, thank you comrade - and the mods in general - for organizing this effort effectively. 
>No, I'm trying to show you the flaw in inherently divisive ideologies where you have to create nebulous bogeymen in order to raise your pitchfork mob. \n\nThe bogeyman isn't created, though. As anyone who has ever been poor, or arbitrarily arrested, or been treated differently because of an innate attribute of their existence can tell you (that's most people in the world btw), power structures are very real.\n\n>Of course there is oppression in society, but if you can't even specify the oppressor, then how in the world could you possibly fix it? \n\nTo a leftist, the oppressor is capitalism. That's about as clear an identification as you can get. Leftists seek to abolish capitalism, and with it will go the oppressive institutions that I have mentioned. \n\nDefending capitalism is essentially the thing the poster above me was ultimately referring to as moderates defending the oppressor. I'm not saying that defending oppression is inherently bad. I understand that living within a system your whole life, not seeing anything wrong with it from your perspective, and then being told that it is oppressive can sound wrong. The bad part about it though is when one is able to acknowledge and identify the power structures in our society and think that their existence is ok.
>Why is it an objectively awful place to live? Also your comments of it as a government unworthy of existence constitutes orientalism and imperialist attitudes, as it was a government chosen by the Korean people and supported by them.\n\n"Suffrage is guaranteed to all citizens aged 17 and over. In reality, elections in North Korea are non-competitive and feature single-candidate races only. Those who want to vote against the sole candidate on the ballot must go to a special booth - without secrecy - to cross out the candidate's name before dropping it into the ballot box—an act which, according to many North Korean defectors, is far too risky to even contemplate."\n\n"Members of the Supreme People's Assembly are elected to five-year terms, and meet for SPA sessions up to ten days per year. The Supreme People's Assembly elects a standing committee known as the Presidium, which exercises legislative functions when the Assembly is not in session. It also elects the Chairman of the National Defence Commission, the country's chief executive, and the Premier."\n\nSo you're telling me the Supreme People's Assembly, which is totally a democratic institution, has just coincidentally elected the heirs of Kim Il-Sung each time, and that it totally isn't a hereditary dictatorship? Sure. The people chose a revolutionary change, undoubtedly, but through the seizure of state power the Kims have betrayed the worker's revolution, just like Stalin did.\n\n>EDIT: DPRK has free healthcare, full employment, guaranteed 8 hour workday, leisure as a legal right, free education and the right to democratic assembly as well as universal suffrage. That sounds like a fucking great place to live \n\nYeah well they also have fucking concentration camps for political dissidents, regular famines, and state repression and control of media. Their condition of continual poverty may be in large part attributable to the actions of imperialist nations, but that's not close to an acceptable excuse for the immeasurable misery wrought by the North Korean state, as also with any other authoritarian state. If you want to go live there, fucking go, because supporters of the DPRK are less than useless to the cause of the working class.

I think /u/unclemeat has hit on a point I've noticed: You're basing your argument off what's distilled from common knowledge than what actually goes on in the research community.\n\nSociology doesn't have a NDT, Richard Dawkins, or whatever but neither does chemistry or computer science. To say that a field is only relevant based on who advocates for it in the public sphere is putting more weight on popularity than substance. This isn't high school. \n\n
*Beijing, China, in Party Headquarters*\n\nWith Western imperial countries essentially powerless and the Communist ideology in strong resurgence throughout the world, there was only one place left to go: Russia. China’s people and the Party demanded it because it was the next logical step to securing a world safe from capitalist endeavors. Russia, once the bastion of liberty and equality, turned into a broken serfdom of private ownership protected by “militias” which were no more than hired thugs. To turn the world anew and usher a new world peace, China would need Russia to reclaim its Communist mantle on the world stage. \n\n“What Russia once did for China, China will do for Russia” became the mantra at the Party politburo and some at the National Party Congress.\n\nGeneral Li Han was called before the Party politburo, a small elite of 25 people who led the Communist government. \n\n“We do not like the tone you are taking with the rest of the party, General,” Stephanie Chan said to Li. In the front of a hall were some of China’s most powerful political leaders, seated behind opulent desks with two tiers. “To quote, ‘China cannot afford to send more men to Russia. We are too weak from our last war that we barely won. Our dreams must be tampered by reality.’ Let me ask you General Li, do you know what is at stake here?”\n\nGeneral Li shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He noticed Stephanie’s slight American-english accent in her mandarin. “Madam, yes,” he said leaning into his table, “we are about to send men to topple a dictatorship regime, while we are the on the edge of instability at home. You have a dream to bring Communism to the world. With respect, I say, we cannot afford it now.”\n\nStephanie Chan snapped back, “What would you say about our North Korean allies, who already occupy parts of far east Russia? Are we to leave them alone and face obliteration from Russia’s forces? Have you no regard for your fellow Communist?”\n\n“Again, with respect madam, we can support the North Koreans by-“\n\n“By sending them goodwill packages?!” Stephanie snapped at Li.\n\n“By providing rear-detachment aid such as medical supplies, money and food. The Koreans will be able to hold what they won.” Stephanie scoffed. The rest of the Politburo whispered quietly to themselves about the terse exchange. \n\nStephanie heard two tables down her colleague say, “He’s the only one who can architect such a plan…”\n\n“Maybe I’ve been too harsh, let us pause, and let me ask you what we would need to win Russia?” Stephanie asked.\n\n“First, time. Half of our divisions are not battle ready for a Russian winter and a vicious march through wastelands. That will be at least six months from now. Second, equipment, since some of our units are still using things acquired from the West’s losses. That’s including their cars, armored carriers and in some cases, rifles and ammunition. Third, more soldiers.  We will need at least four hundred thousand.”\n\nStephanie narrowed her gaze at General Li, “You will get only two hundred thousand.”\n\nGeneral Li knew he had a long fight ahead of him.\n\n—\n\nStephanie went to sleep that night, rehashing her words to General Li. It looked like the General will remain obstinate to his cause. “If I am to claim the world as my own - and not repeat the mistakes of my past lives - I’ll have to kill General Li.” She resigned herself to assassinating General Li and naming herself the Grand Marshall of the People’s Army. Once she made that decision, sleep came easy to her. Russia and its winter will be no match for her and her Army.
I'm very loosely familiar with anarchism, but haven't read anything on it. Any recommendations?
It's gotten a lot better for me, I'm happy to report. Doctors and a supportive family played a key part. \n\nI've had to see multiple doctors for various reasons. One guy slept while I was recounting my experiences in Iraq. Another one would forget what we talked about the week before, sometimes confusing me with Vietnam veterans. But even seeing the bad doctors helped a little bit, and that's realistically the best you can get. There are no major revelation days where you PTSD is markedly improved. PTSD improvement comes from slowly chipping away at it for months, even years at a time. \n\nI've had to see psychiatrists and various psychologists. The best psychologists were the ones with their doctorate (PsyD). The psychiatrists bring the symptoms down, but the psychologists bring about the healing. \n\nI took Zoloft for a long time. I eventually switched to escitalopram when my symptoms calmed down. I regularly engage in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) where I face my triggers and emotional responses. \n\nAs far as my family, my wife was very understanding. I had to send her a lot of literature and articles so she could understand. She also found PTSD support groups for families on Facebook - that was probably her best education. It helped her learn that what I go through, and what she has to deal with, is completely normal. And that sense of normalcy makes her more supportive of me. \n\n\n
Thank you for the thoughtful critique! It's exactly what I've been looking for. \n\nI'm not a stranger to writing - I'm a creature of the internet - but writing an actual narrative to completion is exciting territory. The story is for a creative writing course, so I don't know if I'll keep writing creatively afterwards. Your thoughts, nonetheless, will help me decide. \n\nAgain, thank you!!
I'm a little confused, so help me out here, how did you get your observation from my comment?
I'm back in the states after a week-long visit to the Motherland. The last time I visited was 15 years ago, when I was 14 years old. I can't stop thinking about 'home.' Finally, a place where I look just like everyone else, where the food is familiar and so is the culture. I just feel *at home* in the Philippines.\n\nI'm fortunate enough to be a fairly strong/stocky person with some time in the US Army, so walking down dangerous streets or worrying about bullets at NAIA aren't as big of a deal to me. I just gotta keep my mouth shut and pretend I speak only Chinese when I want to avoid uncomfortable situations.\n\nI somewhat regret not returning to the motherland sooner, so I could see what other options I would have in my life. I was born and raised in the states. I already have a family, a fairly stable work/school situation and excellent healthcare benefits in the US. From the outside, I suppose, it would seem like all the boxes are checked off. Yet... I still long for something more. I long for warm nights sitting on the porch with my titas, titos and cousins, just shooting the shit and not worrying about tomorrow too much. I miss being late for everything because we take our time to think spontaneously. I miss travelling between the Novaliches and Manila and getting fresh lechon. I miss brightening up the days of my cousins and fellow countrymen when I give them extra money I get from my US government pension. \n\nI speak really bad Tagalog. If I were to go anywhere based on my fluency, it would be here in the US and then Mexico afterwards because I can have an intelligent conversation in Spanish. Tagalog... well, it's laughable, and I'm made fun of all the time for it. I like that. Filipinos aren't so uppity about image as people are in the States.\n\nThere isn't a point to my random discussion. I just miss home.

You are right, it cannot happen without violence at some point. I think the question is 'when' - will it happen early, ensuring a long and bloody revolution? Or later, after modest reforms sow discontent but prime the population for a communist uprising?\n\nIn either case, the bourgeoisie have proven themselves to act proactively and violently in the interests of capital. No only domestically, but internationally with the Iraq war, Vietnam, Korean War, etc. It's a long-standing pattern of behavior that's as old as America and Europe.\n\nIf they're willing to act violently to further their interests, they'll fight like hell to survive. And for people in power, ceding just an inch is a fight for survival. 
I'm on the other side of your equation. If I had stayed in, this year would've been my 12th year in. Instead, I got out in 2010 in my 7th year. I loved my job -- being a medic is satisfying. \n\nI was ready to re-up and go on another deployment in 2010 but my girlfriend, now wife, implored me to stay. So I got out. I went to a top-tier university, and though it's been a few years, I'm also a semester away from graduation. :)\n\nHere's a couple pieces of advice.\n\nOne, don't get sucked into the "sunk cost" fallacy. In other words, it's the idea that just because you put in the time towards something, you should see it through. That's BS. Don't keep doing something unfulfilling just because you put the time in - that means only more time doing the suck. At the very least, eight more years of suck. [An article on what the sunk fallacy is.](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-makes-you-act-stupid.html)\n\nWhat to expect on the outside:\n\n- Finishing your degree with a bunch of kids. But these kids are smart. And if you give them a chance, I bet you'll find they'll look up to you. \n\n- Finding creative and challenging jobs --> Which also means much more money. \n\n- A community of veterans who appreciate the service, but are glad to be out (and occasionally wish they were still in, but not really)\n\nYour current dilemmas with your girlfriend will not pan out, but this isn't r/relationships. I'd just say that if you do your own thing and become successful, she might come back to you, but my intuition is that it's already gone. Your other dilemma, your debt, is your ultimate deciding factor other than personal motivation. That can be overcome.\n\nAssuming $50K debt with around a 7% interest rate over 5 years, you're paying about $200-$300/month. GI Bill in places like Southern California is over $2,000, higher in other cities. So, you're spending about 10% of your income on debt; not bad. Plus, if you start your VA claim now, you'll get a nice padding to float you just in case you have emergency expenses. If you get a decent place for around $1200, you have about $500/month to live on. Want to live a challenge? :)\n\nOn the real, I'm really glad I got out. I miss the mission. The challenges. The sense of belonging, sure. But the personal fulfillment to do something great (I'm applying to PhD programs right now), is better than a lot of things I did in the Army. In the civilian world, you get to carve your own road and do things your way. It's empowering as fuck.\n\nBest of luck on whatever decision you make.
I posted this on Facebook with this photo:\n\n> Looking at you, Piketty and Krugman.\n\n> Economics, as a field, has turned to the quantitative side without good qualitative analysis to base it on. There are foundational ideas of economics that just don't hold up: Market actors aren't necessarily rational, none of them access to perfect information and aren't always using their goods/services to maximum utility.\n\n>Yet, despite having a loose grip on the qualitative side of economics, they are upheld in high esteem. There is a Council of Economic Advisers, whose stellar plans include thinking that neo-liberal market policies would help our poor, or that the economic stimulus package of 2008 would bring in roughly 7% increase in GDP (I'm recalling from memory -- I can't find my source), but actually brought in half of that. For every position in economics there are, there is roughly the same number who oppose it. There is little consensus in the field, and this stems from poor qualitative understandings. How many economics majors are like, "My degree is useless."?\n\n>Economics is masqueraded as science, but good social science requires good qualitative analysis. And the field with good qualitative analysis, sociology, is cast as un-scientific potions. Yet, sociology tends to have uniformity in opinions and analysis. We know why GDP is not growing as fast as we'd like, we know why the 2008 stimulus package didn't work as well, we know why there are still poor people in the richest country in the world. But we're cast as the radicals, the socialist, the marxist, the outsiders.\n\n>Until America lets go of its reverence for orthodox economists (and well, the system of exploitation in general), America will continue to see wages go down, inequality grow, and social unrest come about.
What's the grave consequence of what you call the panic of the 90s? What massive reform that was championed that lead to detriment to society? Were the findings found to be true or false in the long term? And was it researchers themselves who propagated the fear, or media who took research and ran with it?
Sorry I'm a little late to the selection process - I really enjoy this sub. Would it be possible to still be involved with the president's cabinet, although I just recently found ModelUSGov?\n\nI'm an Iraq war veteran with some experience in writing policy reports (undergrad work). 
I'm sure the fork isn't - I don't know how to tell with the frame. Is it the two holes right above where the wheel hub mounts to the frame? If that's the case, I guess my bike isn't disc brake compatible after all :(
I used to be an Army Medic. I went to Iraq. I used to be a liberal, then, when war smacked me silly, I begun my road to full-hearted, revolutionary socialism. A part of me still believes that the revolution can be peaceful, because having seen the cost of war personally...\n\nAnyway. I was an EMT for a while. I tried my hand at a small business as a wedding photographer. Now, I just finished my undergraduate studies and will be applying to PhD programs. In my off time, I'm working on a documentary. 
I didn't know this. Now, I do. :) Thanks!
I just built a computer. Would it be better to buy Windows 8 and get the free upgrade, or wait and purchase Windows 10?
Funny story time. When I went to basic training, I was put in a platoon full of others who enlisted as medics. My battle buddy (your assigned partner for accountability purposes) didn't know that "medical specialist" was actually a medic - he freaked out, didn't like it, felt betrayed by his recruiter because all the recruiter said was, "Yeah, healthcare specialists only work in the hospitals."\n\nI, on the other hand, was all about the guts and glory, literally and was happy to be a medic. \n\nAnyway, the long and short of it, from what I last found Googling my old friend, is that he's still in, loving the Army, well accomplished while I'm here getting fat going to college. I have PTSD and have a very complicated love-hate relationship with the Army.\n\nIn other words, being a medic is often what it is described, but what you take out of it over time depends on the person.
I'm sorry, I can't. It was a relatively short seminar. 
Then anarchist "place"? 
This is getting long in the tooth, so I'll boil it down to the fundamental issue at hand.\n\nOn a shooting range, everyone is a safety officer.\n\nIn life or death situations, everyone is each other's keeper. If you cannot value the input of men and women who are the most analogous to your profession, you reinforce the stereotype myself and other **edit** (critical) veterans have: You don't care. But no worries, I'll still flag you on the range, because that's all of our jobs. 
haha fair enough
I'm not one to speak directly to the drug problem in the Philippines; I don't live the daily grind of my countrymen. There are a lot of Filipino comrades who scroll this subreddit and they would know better.\n\nBut for what it's worth, within my family and my very small circle of friends, drugs are not an issue. Yet I would be hesitant to say that Duterte is empowering himself and the cronies from the drug war - he isn't cut from the traditional bourgeoisie cloth of Filipino aristocracy. He doesn't come from a famous family (almost a pre-requisite for entering politics in the Philippines), has no connections to big business and he's willing to use force against the establishment. I think this is where him and Trump part ways. Trump is classic bourgeoisie scum. Duterte has yet to reveal himself to kowtow to  bourgeoisie demands -- though with his recent statement about Hitler, I suspect he may be creating a new bourgeoisie culture. 
> I am criticizing sociology and the social sciences for their outward effects on the society at large - and whatever they are doing, however they are doing it, seems to make them a negative on society. They are fueling an increasingly polarized, censorious and paranoid culture, and need to change their publication and research standards to reflect the negative impact they are having.\n\nHere's some social science research that has fundamentally changed our lives in positive ways:\n\n**Game Theory**\nDeveloped by John Nash, who had a movie made about him starring Russell Crowe, is credited with creating a theory that has quantified human behavior that influences how we think of foreign policy, optimize street lights in Toronto, finding new and better ways of voting. How we create AI today is partially dictated by the mathematical understanding of game theory.\n\n**Nuclear Logics**\nA book written by Dr. Solingen, has developed a theory as to why states like Iran and North Korea seek nuclear weapons despite international pressure. That the weapons are less to defend against outsiders, but more to consolidate internal power by showing strength. This has deep implications, paired with Game Theory, that demonstrate international actors are indeed rational, against popular opinion.\n\n**Symbolic Interactionism**\nPeople are usually believe that society affects individual behavior, or that behavior affects society in the whole. Symbolic interactionism is a descriptive theory by George Mead, a sociologist, who posits that we are influenced by society's rules and structures, but we are rather in a 'conversation' with society at large and have the power to re-define what came before us. This has implications for people fighting for equal rights, like minorities or the poor, who often feel trapped - and also gives powerful people knowledge on how their actions can affect others.\n\n**Reactive Ethnic Identities** \nAs American society marginalizes ethnic minorities in the country either by threats of deportation or critizing them in the public sphere, Ruben Rumbaut has found that under duress, minorities will cling on to their ethnic identities with more resolution. In the US, this has deep implications against anti-immigration sentiment - that the intensifying of anti-immigration sentiment will increase the very thing others are fighting for.\n\n**Split-second decision making for law-enforcement and the military**\nLt. Col. Grossman wrote in his book, "On Killing," that his research on how other individuals kill is the opposite of human nature, and that training people to kill requires a lot of psycho-manipulation of soldiers. Further, his research finds that law enforcement are more likely to kill innocent people of color when they have less experience in their field -- and it isn't just because they're rookies, but their brains haven't developed the neural pathways for effective identification of threats.\n\n**"We Fired Too Many Bullets in Vietnam"**\nAt first blush, to claim the United States engaged in wanton violence in Vietnam from the 60s and 70s reeks of liberal, anti-war hippies. Yet, this is the dissertation of Army General Petraeus when he got his PhD at Yale (I think). This isn't a fluke. Top generals in the military typically hold multiple master's degrees or a PhD. Anyway, his theory for claiming that America's excessive use of force in Vietnam was the reason for losing the war was successfully applied against insurgents in Iraq from 2006-2010 - it's famously known as COIN. I, as a former soldier, owe a great deal of gratitude to this General/Academic who used his research to save human lives.\n\n\nI could go on - but the list of positive influences of social science goes a long way. For further reading on impactful social science studies, here is a short list of interesting and influential ideas that are available today: **World systems theory, democratic peace theory, confirmation bias, relative deprivation, the Milgram experiment, the Standford prison experiment, attribution theory**\n\n---\n\nLook, you're right to criticize the field of Social Science, but a lot of the problems you've highlighted elsewhere in your thread is not isolated to only Social Science. Further, many of the movers and shakers within society are practitioners of social science -- psychologists who help my fellow soldiers with PTSD have social science backgrounds; anthropologists who want to know the culture of racism in the military have made integration successful; economists have developed models to suggest best traffic patterns for freeways; sociologists have come to illustrate the vast social inequities due to government policy; politicians typically hold degrees in political science, where they become well-informed of the issues they tackle.\n\nYou claim that social science is divisive to social discourse, but I would suggest, it's ingrained into all major aspects of society that it's virtually impossible to see. The places of derision are few in between, and come to only highlight how rigorous the study can be.  
Hi there! I filled out the survey a few days and haven't heard if I've been approved or denied. When do you think I'll be able to know?
Oh. That explains why I laid in bed for forty eight hours wondering if I was going to die.\n\nI made it, though!
That's awesome! While reading the news, I learn. While I learn, I consider the news in an intellectual context. Perhaps you poorly phrased your question.\n\nWhat you're probably getting at is if this sub should be more active to reach out to the curious people, or save our energy to talk about issues that matter. I believe that if we continue to bring in the news, first and foremost, and discuss our analysis, people will learn. Thus, fulfilling our objective.\n\nWhat that practically means is that when a news article is put up, and there is a discussion, and there is a liberal/conservative/reactionary detractor, we save our energy with a link to 'commonly mis-held beliefs' page where we discuss their detractions. Something like if someone said, "But business owners give us opportunity!" and then there is a repertoire of links we can pull from to rebut that position. That way, we save our energy, educate the people and don't deviate too far from the issues at hand.
It's talked about briefly in this book:\nhttp://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520274020\n\nI am away from home at the moment, but when I get the chance, I'll crack it open and find the exact quote for you.
Comrade, I didn't know that un-aligning a country from the hegemony of the United States colonialism after a hundred years and encouraging and creating a safe city among numerous violent neighbors count as 'occasional turkey'. Consider me informed.
> Matt Rooney, a lawyer and conservative blogger at SaveJersey.com, told The Jersey Journal that Jersey City wouldn't be able to afford to offer a higher minimum wage if it weren't for state taxpayers. Rooney expressed anger that Jersey City receives a total of $490 million in state aid — that includes the aid given to its public school district — and yet continues to approve long-term tax breaks for developers.\n\nFuck this dude. \n\nI spent my formative years in Jersey City, and the reason it gets a ton of public aid is because it is the ghetto. Literally, the ghetto. People use that term all the time to describe squalid conditions, but what they really mean is Jersey City. The school system is so underfunded and poorly staffed that even multi-million dollar investments from companies like Apple make **marginal dents** in the graduation rate and giving students workable skills. Kids were still getting shanked on a *daily* basis. \n\nLong term residents and families live on welfare because there are no jobs, the state and corporations has spent decades divesting in Jersey City and the police force are a bunch of unprofessional asshats. \n\nThings are on the uptick for the city these days, in terms of development. The area closest to Manhattan looks really good. But that's due to rapid gentrification. Poor landlords got a good cashout by giving their properties to developers, but their tenants had to move out to further to find affordable rents. As for the rest of the city, it's mostly paycheck-to-paycheck survival with low wage jobs because access to skilled jobs are hard to get. \n\nThe worst part of it is probably the mentality of the people. While many profess to vote Democrat, many have their world view like working-class Republicans. With enough hard work in their lowest-tier job, they will own the company they work for. They don't see that folks over in Basking Ridge (super rich neighborhood 1hr west) are being groomed for a world-class education so they may be junior execs at the age of 24. They fail to connect that these junior execs types are exactly the reason why citizens of Jersey City don't have better jobs. \n\nIt is a perfect system to reinforce class divisions: An ideology of hard work will lead to a better life, but the tools to a better life such as education and infrastructure (edit: also access to capital), are out of their grasps. \n\nWhenever I think of how capitalism fucks people, all I have to do is think about my teenage life in Jersey City.
Replace my words 'tank' with 'wheeled-armored fighting vehicle' and tell me if it makes an effective difference.
Thanks! I suppose in retrospect, it is eventful. :)\n\nI'm not involved with any socialist orgs, though I associate with them when I find an overlap with my main advocacy arena: student veteran population. \n
I notice this is a tax on carbon emissions. Obviously this is trying to attack the negative externality of environmental pollution. This is a commendable, and well-written effort. Just a couple questions.\n\nIs there a reason why this would be preferable to cap and trade? And what kind of power would we have to give EPA to enforce this adequately?\n\nIn any case, curbing carbon emissions is a high priority, and thank you for bringing this up.
None of us are calling for disarming the police. Instead, we **highly question** the legitimacy and effectiveness of war-fighting equipment on people we are to protect. We're not questioning your squad cars, your guns, your rifles, your helicopters. Have that, plus cool things like night vision goggles, sniper rifles and what not. \n\nWe're **really** talking about fucking *tanks* designed to fight a protracted, counter-insurgency wars involving the death and destruction of hundreds of people - on a good day. That includes repeated automatic machine gun fire, plasma-heated copper IEDs that penetrate ceramic armor, and Russian-grade munitions.\n\nNow, if you would like to argue that fighting the civilian populace is the same, you will run into huge arguments from this community. What I mean is that, by your community fighting for these MRAPs, we are forced to draw the conclusion that you think your fighting circumstances are similar to fighting the largest deployment of American troops since WWII. \n\nTrue or not, the perception is the same. You are waging a war on a war undeclared.\n\nI dropped by /r/protectandserve and I was flabergasted that the community not only *thinks* they need them, but also *deserve* them. Where is the large insurgent community in our country that is waging a protracted violent war against an invading force? If there isn't any, you don't need MRAPs. If there is, MRAPs is only a short-term fix for a long-term institutional and societal problem.
Sorry you don't have much of a choice. I recommend entering it with a "don't cede an inch" kind of mentality.... though you may do that at your own academic peril.\n\nWhat may get you through it is taking his arguments to their logical extremes. "Ah, yes, the anglo culture of the English allowed democracy to spread. But as we know, it was only for the whites. So, we should extinguish the non-whites." Then cite sources such as social darwinism, scientific racism, etc. It's unlikely he'll see the satire, while you get to laugh your ass off, while getting an A+.\n\nBest of luck, comrade.
Done :)  Thanks!
I suppose as an American where there are no true-left organizations, a group could easily look 'left' to me. haha Though they really do have marxist thoughts. I think when push comes to shove, they will arms to bring power back to the working class. But that's just my opinion. 
Just two likes. Either the Facebook algorithm stopped it from being shared, or I have bourgeoisie scum as friends!
One, your tenor is borderline inappropriate for a serious discussion. It even stinks of reactionary nastiness. \n\nTwo, to your main point: There are a lot of revolutionary work occurring in cities, all the time. Perhaps not "large", but they exist. (Someone can feel free to correct me, but the last mass potentially revolutionary movement was taken down very effectively by DHS: The Occupy Movement.) \n\nI ask that you browse www.counterpunch.com and www.liberationews.com to get your fill of photos and articles. \n\nAnd I think your doubtfulness stems from a lack of knowledge - which isn't necessarily your fault. The ideological apparatus makes sure that we don't know about revolutionary ideas. Newspapers, TV shows, articles from major news outlets don't talk about revolutionary movements. Here's an article by Chomsky about ideological control: [Necessary Illusion](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=gpuMrU3houQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&ots=fqden-EpQG&sig=8X_-F2TaBZT3AW-ja_1-T5qzPX0#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\nAnd excuse my French, but you sir, are the one full of shit.\n
I would just ask you to consider dialectical materialism and consider if people really have every choice and benefit laid out before them. 
Hey, thanks for sharing. I just got my diagnosis for Bipolar II recently, with clear manic and depression episodes. (I'm 30/m, Army veteran with PTSD) Like you, I question the diagnosis, but I figure, if the treatment works, it doesn't matter what I have. It's more like, you want the treatments more than the diagnosis. That's where the real healing begins - at the treatment. Of course, if you get the wrong treatment because of a bad diagnosis, that's bad. But, your end goal is a positive treatment, and the diagnosis is one of those 'check boxes' to get it. \n\nAnyway, when I first got my diagnosis for PTSD, I totally didn't believe them. They said, "come in for treatment!" I would say, "Nah, it ain't that bad." Then, I started losing my friends, my financial situation went into the shitter, and I got more depressed. I then considered going in for treatment not because I thought I was sick, but because I wanted to feel better. During the course of treament, I discovered *how* sick I really was.  \n\nAn additional key part is being brutally honest with oneself and providers - so honest that you may occasionally think you're exaggerating (at least in my case, where I have always tended to be guarded). So docs would ask, "Have you thought about suicide?" And my socially-acceptable answer would've been, "Sometimes. Not really." But the real answer is "Almost everyday for the last three months." One day, I gave the real answer. That's when things got better. Some days, I thought about suicide for like 10 seconds, some days I thought of it for hours, some days I don't think of it at all. With such a wide range, thinking 'almost everyday' seemed like an exaggeration. But I think, in retrospect, it worked out better because it raised the alarm bells that I was having legitimate issues. \n\nSo my long point is, I hope this works out well for you. It's hard to know yourself. Being honest and evaluating your behavior from an objective, outside point of view is hard. 
This isn't non-fiction nor is it historical... but my favorite Marxist movie of 2015 was "Mad Max: Fury Road".  I don't know if the franchise carries the themes, but it almost makes no allusions as to its demonization of private ownership, destruction of earth through exploitation, and seizing the power of the bourgeoisie by taking ownership of the means of production. There are three towns: War town, Gas town and Water town. All of them are buttressed by a false consciousness of a religious fervor and protection of the ruling party, at the expense of the lowly, poor people.\n\nSpoilers:\n\nAt the end of the movie, it says: \n>"Where must we go, we who wander this wasteland, in search of our better selves?"\n\nAt the end of the movie, a group of people search into a desolate wasteland hoping for something better. Yet, it becomes apparent to them, that going back to where they ran from is the most logical choice. The quote asks us to think that our futures aren't somewhere else, but in our place of home. The movie answers by saying: 'seizing the means of production.'
I don't keep up with the interpersonal relationships with the socialist subreddits. What kind of antics was G0vernment up to that you disagreed with?
This needs to be at the top of the page! If it's true, Rojava is the largest anarchist state in the world!
I like how the bourgeoisie are like, "There are poor people in Cuba! It's because of Socialism!" But then you turn around and point at something like this, and they can't connect it to capitalism. 
There is a higher percentage of leftists in universities, for sure, but they are typically not allowed to flourish. True marxists usually climb as high as lecturers and adjunct faculty, which is in contrast to 'rising stars' who typically toe the bourgeoisie line and thus, find promotion easier. That's not to say the 'rising stars' don't hold true leftist ideas, but the ones who keep it under wraps are the ones who tend to get tenure. If you start saying things like 'Marx', 'Class consciousness', 'Political Economy', 'Conflict theory' or anti-Israeli sentiments, you'll be quickly labeled a Marxist and won't see yourself move up. \n\nThus, it should be evident that universities serve to indoctrinate people into bourgeoisie thinking. Private universities who are aggressive in that sort of indoctrination will likely perish under a socialist system, if it fails to adapt to the new environment. There's also a chance that these private schools will likely turn public. If these private schools turn public, they may in fact become larger, as money and resources will be re-directed from the Defense Department to universities. 
I've seen them pop up from time to time when I'm doing work for the people. They're good folks. When people are ready, I point them to PSL.
People often think Socialism=Communism=Marxism.\n\nTruth is, while Marx did write a lot - tens of thousands of pages, heaping volume upon heaping volume - he devoted only 10 pages of it towards what communism should look like. A key part, removing capitalism from the picture, never truly came to fruition in China and USSR. In other words, capitalism still existed in these so-called socialist states, leading to the idea that they're 'failed.'\n\nIn the case of DPRK, I would suggest reading the book by Bruce Cumings "North Korea" and "The Korean War" which argues, with very thorough scholarship, that what we know and learn about North Korea is a product of misinformation. That, in reality, DPRK may actually be the closest thing to a socialist utopia we have today.\n
As a Filipino-American, I have mixed feelings about Duterte. He fits into neither the traditional notions of left or right.\n\nThe part that appeals to me is that he's down for national realization that breaks away from the colonial powers of the West (ahem, America). He's not down for American military prescence in the country, and is willing to hedge Beijing's influence against Washington. That's smart politics that will only serve to lift Filipinos out of their dire poverty. His successes as a mayor cannot be ignored either - among all the rancorous cities in the Philippines, his city of Davao is known for being the quietest and most peaceful among them. He liberated sex workers, encouraged cooperative farms and ruthlessly went after petty and grand criminals. Thus it's plain to see his ability to overcome bureaucratic inertia is no small feat. That's why he has nearly unanimous public support right now.\n\nYet as an American who believes in the rule of law, his drug war policies are plainly undemocratic. Worse, it's obviously designed to create an enemy to gin up nationalism. This is buttressed by the fact that his approach to drug users/pushers is regressive -- rather than addressing the social conditions in which encourage drug use (desperate poverty, lack of adequate housing, poor public education, soul-crushing wage labor in factories, inadequacies in public mental health), he punishes the users directly. \n\nI was hoping he would lead the Philippines towards a more independent state, which would make it ripe for a stronger socialist movement. But with him recently stating that he's pretty much like Hitler, I have to evacuate all my support for him. His successes, from Davao to winning the Presidency, has clearly gone to his head - and is willing to flex his presidential power to circumvent the democratic process. It would be fine to circumvent the process, I suppose, if he were actually liberating the people. Maybe he is, but he's making sure a lot of people die without due process to get his way.\n\n--\n**Sidenote**: I have to mention this because I've been temporarily banned for being unclear: I don't support fascists or Trump. 
Thank you for your thoughtful comment. I look forward to a vigorous discussion of the issues of police work and relevant military experience.\n\n>The average Spec-4 or LCpl is qualified to give advice on carrying heavy objects for medium distances. And that's really about it. If you actually served, you know that.\n\nYou discredit the hard work the military and government has put since the Vietnam war to professionalize even the lowest ranks of the military.\n\nSaying that a specialist or lance corporal is a discredit to all those E-4s who raided Fallujah in 3-man teams to flush out insurgents [(relevant video of E4s clearing a home)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoEsN6mDLfs&ab_channel=USMilitaryVideos); it gives little credit to the E-4s who risked their asses under withering automatic weapon enemy fire to save lives [(relevant story)](http://www.stripes.com/military-life/christopher-waiters-i-counted-17-shooters-then-i-was-scared-1.92811); it gives little credit to Lance Corporal Marines who led a platoon of 40 men crossing the border of Kuwait to encounter Iraqi soldiers, and make the call for indirect fire to kill of those men (personal friend of mine). Yes, I know E-4s of all types who have had courage to literally lead men in war, and do what both the police and military are trusted to do: Execute the state's ultimate power. The power to kill. \n\nSo yes, while we don't deal with the same population or even the same equipment or rules, our similar outcomes and goals give us the credibility to comment on law enforcement. To the extent which it's legitimate is arguable, but to be amused at our criticisms and discount them offhandedly, is a display of arrogance. (That's not to say that E4s won't show ignorance on their part, but to blow them off completely is arrogance on your community's part)\n\n> Maybe it's my age, maybe it's that my friends enlisted and took their commissions before 9/11, but they're a very different breed than the average Soldier, Sailor, or Marine today.\n\nYou are absolutely right. Today's servicemember is war-hardened and more professional than the ones in the 90s. We are a different breed far and beyond those who proceeded us, and it's by design through our training. I would gladly take an E-3 Eleven-Bravo or even an E-2 Private 0311 to have the discipline and courage and foresight to enact military doctrine, especially COIN ops. If they come back cocky or uncooperative to police, know it isn't you LEOs just personally, but a product of their experiences. \n\nNot only that, our training has vested an unprecedented amount of latitude for E4s who are forced to operate far from the command structure. This is one part because they are being groomed for leadership position, and another part because of the changing military doctrine of Counter-Insurgency. \n\nBut let me get away from the lower enlisted business, because by describing Redditors with military experience as having only "grunt" status is also a disservice and unfair characterization of all the NCOs who have similar feelings. Including this one writing, right here. I am not the only person who scratches his head when there is a group of unarmed Americans protesting and seeing off in the near-distance, an MRAP with a sniper rifle in camouflage gear. I am not the only person who quietly grumbles when a fellow soldier dies at the hands of law enforcement. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause of counter-insurgency doctrine. By definition, counter-insurgency doctrine requires US troops to act more like police than soldiers in a foreign land. -- [COIN primer](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Counter-insurgency#/United_States) & [Relevant RAND report on key aspects of military COIN ops; you will recognize them as major tenants of police work](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9323/index1.html) -- And for many of us, the question is, if we can fight a war where we're suppose to be like police in a foreign nation and have high standards, why can't police at the local level have similar high standards? Some of us conclude you're trigger happy, some of us conclude that the beat cop doesn't have enough everyday experience. For me, I don't give personal attributions to the problems. Rather, the perception of an incompetent and trigger happy police force is a symptom of our society's design, rather than bad cops. But that's just me.\n\nMy simple point is this: Police aren't the only people who do police work. Police aren't the only ones who are trusted to kill when necessary. Police aren't the only ones to deal with civilians. Police aren't the only ones who have laws and regulations. We don't go through what you guys do every day, but our experience should give us some legitimacy to throw down a red card and call bullshit.
*busts out introductory sociology literature saved up over the years*\n\nFirst, I'm glad there is a revived interest in socialism in American discourse. Outside observers may notice that people on /r/Socialism are weary of Sanders. I suspect this is from the history of Americans consistently duped by the ruling class, or in our terms, the bourgeoisie. (Among other things) This shouldn't be too unfamiliar to liberals, as the former senator from Illinois, Barack Obama has shown: No prosecution of bankers, increased deportation of undocumented workers and increased military action despite 'draw downs.' Just to name a few choice topics.\n\nBut the real crux of the matter of a socialist/communist is having a big bone to pick with capitalists. Yes, some capitalists work hard and have a lot of goods to show for it. And some of them really think they're helping humanity out. But in the words of orthodox economics, there are a lot of negative externalities that, in a cost-benefit analysis, make capitalism an ugly choice for how society is run. First, capitalism wants one thing: more capital. (read: money) This end-all goal of capitalism skews human behavior to shit on itself. Some people think they can own others and the value of their labor (slavery, or, wages), destruction of the environment to make a buck, and complex ideological systems that keep people's horizons shunted open, but barely. Some have a lot of goods under this scheme, but as it looks in America, that some is an elite few while the rest of us fight for scraps.\n\nIn terms of positive psychology, this system doesn't allow for flourishing, and may be the reason why suicide and depression rates are so high for developed countries.\n\nSo, some introductory reading. \n\n**Introductory thoughts**\n\n["Imagine a Country: Life in the New Millenium"](https://zcomm.org/zmagazine/imagine-a-country-life-in-the-new-millenium-by-holly-sklar/)  by Holly Sklar -- (the website is a little dated, but it's the only thing I could find online from a physical copy I have)\n\n**Stratification (social inequality)/Neo-liberalism economics**\n\n["The Global Collapse: A Non-Orthodox View"](http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2009/bello200209p.html) by Walden Bello\n\n**Politics: Class Dominance, Imperialism and War**\n\n["Testing for Class Dominance View of the Federal Government"](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/class_domination.html) by G.

I have PTSD and my experiences in war have brought on mild symptoms of Bi-Polar II. You made the first step, which is acknowledging you have anxiety, so great! If you haven't sought professional help, I highly recommend it. No problem is too petty to be addressed. I'm on various medicines and it helps tamper down my anxiety. I was highly reluctant to take it, but the effectiveness is true. \n\nAside from professional help, there are meditation apps that work really well. It'll help you self-identify anxiety coming on so you can address it before it becomes totally disabling. \n\nMy recommended list for just starting off in meditation:\n\n* [Meditation Studio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meditation-studio/id1066018502?mt=8) by Gaiam ($2.99) - This is a good app for learning the basics of meditation\n* Learn to Meditate by Meditation Oasis (Something like $2.99) - This one is good too\n* Headspace ($10 after the intro course) - A slower, but perhaps more thorough introduction to meditation\n\nWhat I use regularly for meditation \n\n* Take a Break! by Meditation Oasis - A great way to guide your thoughts in accepting your emotional state\n* [Insight Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zen-timer-meditation-timer/id337472899?mt=8) by Insight Network - (FREE) This one has great guided apps and a decent binural track, plus a neat timer\n\nTypes of meditation you may want to look into:\n\n* Chanting meditation\n* Mindfulness meditation\n* Mantra meditation\n* Transcendental meditation \n* Binural beats\n\nEach one has their strengths. I regularly cycle through all of them depending on my mood. Best of luck. 
I climbed the ranks at Santa's Workshop pretty fast, for a labor pool that doesn't turn over...  at all. People stay here their whole lives, get not very far, and end up with a mediocre amount of savings. Some travel abroad to places like Iceland where they like to haunt humans in the forests, rearrange human closets ever so slightly or make sure there's just a little bit of urine around their toilet seats. In fact, there we recently a packaged excursion package where you can travel with a gnome around the world taking pictures...\n\nI digress. The promotions were good for me because as automation and 3D printers started becoming more normal, more elves were being laid off. Some were put into early retirement. Yet most were forced to become unemployed - Santa took pity on them, but gave them only scraps to survive. Some elves started seal hunting and selling to the Inuit. \n\nBy having some rank, I was able to stay relevant and insulated from the churning economic tides. All the people with some skill - like assembling an RC plane or soldering boards to an AI companion - were replaced by machines. So, all that was left were the elves who could sweep the floor and clean the bathrooms and the other elves, like me, who managed and supervised. \n\nI didn't pay attention to all of this as it was happening, though. \n\nThat was until I walked into my office, I was grabbed by the arms, and an elf with a crimson red beret asked, "Who are you WITH?!"\n\nI drew a blank. The crimson-clad elf must have seen my expression and asked again, "Do you stand with the elves, or the exploitative capitalist regime of SANTA?!"\n\nI was going to start laughing but I noticed the other elves had a very stern look. I saw my old dorm buddy in the back of the group, Phil, and shouted out to him, "Phil! What is this?"\n\n"It's a coup. We're seizing the means of production," Phil said solemnly.\n\n"What the hell is that? All I know is that Santa is going to be pissed as hell if you mess with my schedule today. I have so many excel worksheets and linear regressions to make before -"\n\n"Shut up!" shouted the crimson-clad Elf. "It's simple. You're either with us, or you stand with Santa. We're getting everyone jobs back."\n\nI didn't really know what he meant, but I liked the idea of everyone getting their jobs back. "I'm with you guys. Jobs are good," I said. The two elves flanking me released my arms. The crimson-clad elf said, "My name is Wick, and you'll need this." He handed me a black beret and a motov cocktail. \n\nOn the other side of the warehouse, we heard the hooves of the reindeer clatter along the production line. A loud BANG rang throughout. Wick looked to me and said, "IT'S GO TIME!"
There was one part where Milo went on about trans people committing more sexual crimes than the regular person. Maher didn't even counter it, he tacitly agreed with the message, "Well, that's reasonable."\n\nFucking liberals! 
The information and research is balanced for a per-capita basis, nullifying and discrepancy in raw numbers. 
I'm assuming you're American, just like me. There is a prevalent anti-intellectual bend in our culture: How often does society say that academia and intellectuals are bad, useless, liberals? How often does one hear that he she is proud to be anti-intellectual? Fox News consistently bandies the faults of intellectual people. \n\nThis environment of anti-intellectualism pervades many parts of society, including how we get our information. That's the reason why you're not reading about the research I named off the top of my head. Most people don't care or are annoyed by academic research.  So, if you want to learn about the latest advances in science and research, you have to become an intellectual yourself. That means delving deep into ideas, research and thinking critically (which you're on the path to).\n\nTo answer your question: The research I mentioned actually is the norm. Those pieces of research are actually from the university I attend, which is a mid-tier research facility. We're not even the greatest. And we publish interesting and insightful things all the time. Take what my university publishes and consider that more powerful minds at Ivy Leagues are working on similar ideas. (At Berkeley, a researcher named David Card found that an increase in the minimum wage does not correlate with wage loss in the term, for example)\n
Even if the research method itself is bad (which is a learning process that we're always perfecting), the process of reproducibility and predictions will find if research is good or bad. Further, there's way more ways to conduct surveys than having them mailed-in: online, finding people through social networks, or in person. 
>Unfortunately, that is where the damage is done, in the public sphere. Bad research, incomplete conclusions are propagated as scientific, and the calls for social engineering and reform start, often with grave consequences.\n\nI can think of a couple examples of this, but most of them reach back to the time of Hitler. Can you provide me examples of what you're thinking?
I'm an Army veteran, so I can probably give a little insight to the guilt. Most people know they're joining an institution of killing, but because of society's view, it's justified. Kind of like being a samurai -- vicious, but honorable.\n\nTwo things. First, American society has a confluence of factors that minimize its war crimes: \n\n* Rabid devotion to the military during sporting events; \n* Presidents and other leaders profusely thanking the military for its service;\n* Government leaders seldom admitting the viciousness of war; \n* Video games like Modern Warfare or Counter Strike that glorify combat; \n* Glory is given to WWII veterans and the war in general; \n* Our persistent propaganda machine churning out fear of terrorists. \n\nNone of these are met with popular disgust, so a young man or woman can see that society gives it approval. For me, it was like, "Joining the military must be a good thing because everyone says it's cool. I hear it's tough but so many people say we're fighting real bad guys. And I want to get rid of bad guys." Plus, my family had been serving since WWII (in the Philippines, against the Japanese), so there was a general approval among my support network for joining.\n\nSo one joins expecting some rough times, but they never talk about the bad stuff that happens, especially in war. This leads into my second point, *moral injury*. \n\nMoral injury is an emerging field of study among therapists for veterans. It's similar to PTSD in the sense that it gives persistent feelings of guilt and shame for one's actions. It's different in that guilt or shame can last long after PTSD has been treated effectively (nightmares, startle responses, high anxiety). What we've known for a little while is that humans aren't programmed to be killing machines, and when we're forced to kill (or be in an institution of killing), it goes against our genetic makeup. Thus, it creates massive mental dissonance. \n\nLike, even if you killed a person for a good reason, one can still have moral injury. Imagine snuffing out a life in a tenth of a second, but always pondering about the family and community that raised him. That life took twenty or thirty years of growing up to come into this world, and with one swift action, he/she is gone. It goes against our sense of human beingness, and that guilt just *weighs* on you. **They never talked about it among all the propaganda.**\n\nNor did they mention it when recruited you. They never talk about how American imperialism is directed towards brown people, or how the machine lines the pockets of fat cats. So imagine the sheer surprise when you're faced with it. That's the guilt. In a way, it's a guilt for being gullible. \n\nAs for me, I've made the most of my experience in Iraq. I joined thinking I could make a positive difference as a medic, where I wouldn't have to kill someone, but I later learned that I enabled the war machine. Yet, my experience and persistent questioning of that experience lead me to socialism. 
>I don't believe that filam have lower pay or segregated in America.  \n\nBelieve what you'd like, but the research suggests otherwise.\n\nFrom a Sociology professor on his [personal website](http://www.asian-nation.org/employment.shtml) (of course based on his research) discusses that despite higher educational attainment, Asians (even Filipinos) have second highest personal income:\n\n>... Asian Americans have the **highest rates** of having a college (43% of all adults between 25 and 64) or a law, medicine, or doctorate degree (6.5% of all adults between 25 and 64), they only have the **second highest** median personal (per capita) income behind that for White workers.\n\nIn addition, despite our higher education, we have higher rates of persistent unemployment according to the [Economic Policy Institute](http://www.epi.org/publication/ib323-asian-american-unemployment/):\n\n>Asian American workers with at least a bachelor’s degree **are more likely to be unemployed than white workers** with the same level of education—a fact that is particularly salient because 57.2 percent of the Asian American labor force falls into this category.\n\nThe same institute describes at least a partial reason why:\n\n>**Racial bias** appears to be a factor in patterns of unemployment and long-term unemployment among Asian Americans. Compared with similar white workers, many Asian American workers are having a harder time finding employment.\n\nIf you think that Asians need to work harder to overcome such obstacles like under/unemployment, I'd like to remind you that as a cohort,[ Asians believe in hard work more than any other racial group in America](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/). \n\nIf my sources seemed bias, I present an [academic article by researchers at Harvard](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3203265/Waters_ImmigrationEthnic.pdf?sequence=1):\n\n>However, Hirschman & Wong found that there still were costs associated with Asian ethnicity-when adjusted for background variables, all groups except the Japanese had incomes somewhat less than comparable whites.\n\n>In a multivariate study of income by education and by occupation, Barringer et al (1993:265) found that when other factors were controlled, "whites earned more than Asian Americans in almost all occupational categories except in the professions, where Asian Americans had much higher incomes, but even there they bested whites only among the self employed." **They conclude that Asian Americans are highly educated and convert that education into high status occupations, but nevertheless they are paid less than whites for the same or comparable positions** \n\nIf you'd like to know more, I highly suggest the informative (if not painfully dry) book called "Immigrant America" by Ruben Rumbaut, a race and ethnicity scholar at UC Irvine. He would posit that the evidence I presented would easily fall into the idea of the ["bamboo ceiling."](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bamboo_ceiling) 
> The Spec-4's and LCpls for life chime in with their extensive experience and knowledge.\n\nI didn't know that being on the bottom rung of the chain of command invalidated my opinions, despite, you know, **fighting a war**.\n
I've never been dismayed by the Philippines. Even with the bullet scandal, it's understandable. Extorting $12 from a foreigner isn't much to that person (really), and 500 pesos will go a long way for a Filipino. I'm not saying it's right, but given the dire circumstances most Filipinos live in, I would be surprised it didn't happen more frequently.

Thanks for your reply! It was very informative. So if I get brake adaptors for the right brand that matches the system I'm buying, I should be good to go?\n\n
Your post inspired me to write a reply. It's been months since I've replied or posted to anything on Reddit.\n\nI'm really sorry to hear that your state hasn't legalized cannabis yet. I suffer from PTSD too, as well as sleep apnea, regular nightmares and a bunch of other things from my service in Iraq. Like you, I have two little ones of my own. If I weren't in a legalized state, I don't know what I would do. I'd probably move to a legalized state! haha \n\nIf you want to try something specifically for sleeping, I highly recommend King Louis VIII. It relaxes your body really well and keeps it like that throughout the night. When I first took it, I hit my first REM cycle in YEARS! If you need something to manage a panic attack with a little bit of a mood boost, try Skywalker or Skywalker OG. A lot of PTSD-suffering people report good effects. Neither of these strains will induce too much paranoia. \n\nI wonder if you can make a road trip to a legalized state. If so, you can get a doctor's recommendation in person then walk over to your co-op.\n\n
I did. Your point?
Does this example of one bad research method a reason to dismantle what we have already built up?
So... what's your call to action? What can we do to help? 
Life is doing well -- not where I want to be, but far away from where I used to be. I've been in and out of college for ten years now, still haven't gotten my degree. \n\nThough I've been suffering from PTSD for almost a decade now, I've been secondarily diagnosed with Bipolar for only 9 months ago. I've been probably suffering from Bipolar the whole time I was managing PTSD. So that's complicated therapy because my PTSD treatments were probably making my Bipolar worse. That also explains my difficulty with college. Since I discovered my Bipolar, life became stable. I lost a lot of my friends since my deployment, but I've made new ones since I started my upward trend. \n\nOtherwise, I have two kids, a wife, and a home. We just bought an expensive electric car, so we're good on finances. \n\nMy mood still varies day to day, but I'm not a total wreck. Every day I become a little more productive than the last. I'm finding ways to be thankful and happy; some days are harder than others. \n\nOverall, I'm on an upward trend. One day I'll finish my degree and get a real job. Otherwise, I'd say my core mood is level between happiness and sadness, and recently, I've been having more happy days than sad. 
I was scared for a second, until PT belts.
What a shame that Stephen Fry is such a twat. Otherwise, he would be a great role model. I looked up to him because after going to Iraq, I've come back with PTSD and bi-polar depression, and Stephen Fry has been quite public about his mental health issues. \n\n
Could someone remind me why/how the USSR collapsed? I'm too young to have observed it myself. I've heard theories that it collapsed because the US had flooded the oil market, esp with the liberation of Kuwait from Iraq. Any guidance would be useful :)
Hey bud, I'd suggest trying to up your disability rating. $500 isn't enough. If you're having trouble in the states getting a job, you should apply for IU. Only afterwards, head over to the Philippines. At least with IU, ~$3000 will be enough for a decent place.\n\nQuestion - are you filipino by any chance? Like either of your parents? Because if one of them is a Filipino citizen now, or was during your birth, you are technically a Filipino citizen. Yes, you're a dual citizen. You'll just need to register your birth and proof of your parent's citizenship with your local Philippine embassy. Then, you won't have to worry about any pesky immigration/visa issues.\n\nSource: I'm a fellow 30 y/o veteran, with 80% with the VA currently applying for IU.... with wonderful dreams of moving back to the motherland :)\n
I like the way you think.
What is AlDub and why are all my Titas into it?
Not really. I met Walden Bello - he taught a course at my college - and he seemed to have pretty good Marxist articulations. 
I would give workers the ownership of the means of production.
I really enjoyed this. Like /u/samon53 said, it's a lot compressed. A lot of history. A lot of ideas. It's succinct. It's something I would share with my conservative friends when they say down-low racist shit on Facebook.
May I join the party, comrade? I applied through the survey. 
Younger voters are into Bernie Sanders and his message. I wonder how much of this is due to the fact that more than ever, our youth is going to college. They're being exposed to good explanations for the shortcomings of capitalism and a better way forward. \n\nI'm somewhat surprised this is even possible, since our colleges and universities don't allow radicals to flourish. I wonder how much more the bourgeousie will clamp down on radicals in the future. 
Everyone has their preference, but a good sociologist will make sure that he/she conducts due diligence by putting effort into using all forms of analysis.\n\nAs a famous philosopher once said, there is no universal theory of everything - and some perspectives are better suited for some situations over others.
Hi everyone! I was hoping I could get help with disk brakes.\n\nI bit the bullet and bought a [Gravity CX Gravity](http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/liberty_cx.htm) from Bikes Direct. I knew I would have some bumps, but I figured in the long run, I'd be better off for learning various things about my machine. Unfortunately, I'm pretty frustrated with the stock canti brakes and want to get mechanical disc brakes. (Mechanical because I hear they can be just as good as hydraulics, without the bleeding hassle)\n\nMaybe you guys can help clarify my thinking on the various parts...\n\nHere are things I think I will need to install disc brakes:\n\n* **Mounting kit**: I don't think my bike model has mounts built in, so I'll need to install some. [Here](https://www.rei.com/product/786121/shimano-sm-ma-r160-disc-brake-mount-adaptor-rear?cm_mmc=cse_PLA_GOOG-_-7861210016&CAWELAID=120217890000773366&lsft=cm_mmc:cse_PLA_GOOG) are some Shimano mount adaptors I might buy.\n\n* **Braking cable and housing** Any specific type I'll need? Or general, off the shelf?\n\n* **Disc rotor** I understand most are cross compatible because of standard sizing, except for Shimano. I'm getting the TRP Spyre. Will it come with a rotor, or do I need to order that seperately?\n\n* **Brake caliper** I'm thinking the [TRP Spyre](http://www.trpbrakes.com/category.php?catid=206&productid=1199) - though, I don't know what SLC is\n\nIs there anything else I should be considering for installation? (besides the necessary tools)\n\nThings I don't quite understand:\n\n* **140mm or 160mm or 180mm**: What size is this for? How do I know which one I'll need?\n\n* **Wheel hub** I understand that I'll need a disc-compatible wheel hub for the front, but will I need one for the *rear too*? In other words, do I need to change my wheel hub for the rear?\n\n\nThanks so much for your help everyone!
You can enlist in the reserves/guard wherever you'd like, then switch your residency afterwards, if it's convenient for you. \n\nSource: National guardsman who enlisted in New Jersey, and moved to California for college before going to basic training.
I enlisted in the military, for seven years with the Army, as a medic attached to an infantry unit.\n\nBefore I echo the consensus here, let me just say that socialist veterans are some of the most strident. They know how to organize, reach out and affect policy. Veterans were on the forefront of the anti-war protests during the Vietnam war era and are now standing as meatshields at Standing Rock. Yes, they know military tactics, but more importantly, they know how to trust each other and organize effectively. You would join a special rank within socialist circles (not better necessarily, just with different insight).\n\nIf you join the military, there must be a strong desire to serve. For me, it was seeing 9/11 and the debacle in Iraq, and thinking that serving as a medic would make a net positive impact. (I was wrong, for the most part) Some people like joining the Guard so they can serve their community during disasters; that was probably the highlight of my career.\n\nYet none of that holds anything against the sheer *moral injury* of serving an institution killing. The military is a bully force to enact the desires of the American bourgeoisie. And we all know how fucked up they are. Knowing that you're serving such brutal force weighs on you. Like, I still think that I helped exploit Iraq for its oil by enlisting. What kind of things will you do as we enter into war with Syria? Who might you have to kill? Who are you supporting at home? Or will you put down real social movements in the US? That will weigh on your  heart.\n\nBest of luck. 
Please add me to the Green-Left. Capital belongs to the people who make it! And not the bosses who think they can steal it from you!
As a Filipino-American Socialist, the Communist movement is exciting. I'm really glad to see the 10-year plan coming to fruition. It reminds me of Ho Chi Minh and his effort to wrest his nation from colonial powers. \n\nToday, colonial powers are much less salient in its exploitation of its subjects. How does the New People's Army teach exploitation to its people? Or is it all in the promise of better conditions?\n\nAnd also, what do you think of the openly-Marxist Akbayan party?
Iraq veteran here who regularly uses the VA system in Southern California area. \n\nDon't let particular incidents like this cast a single-sided negative light on the Department of Veteran Affairs. Just because the VA asks if one is suicidal on a seemingly regular basis does that mean they'll catch the right people at the right time. (Or right people at the wrong time)\n\nThe real image here is that there are obviously massive deficiencies within the system, but not for the reasons you may expect.\n\nOne suicide is enough to cause reform in a system, especially if the system is designed to stop a suicide. The reality is that we have twenty-two veterans killing themselves A DAY -- 8,000 a year (same number of people killed on the War on Terror over a decade) -- obviously, something is dreadfully awry. And that number is from a statistic that didn't count data sets from three veteran-heavy states: California, Texas and Illinois. \n\nThe image of the VA also includes a staff wearily dedicated to treating veterans. They're all putting on a full-court press on addressing veteran suicides and homelessness for DECADES, but their battle is one which loses people every day. How would you like to lose every day?\n\nAs far as I know, every VA is paired with local partners to fund research on the dynamics of veteran issues, help veterans find housing and recently, instituted a program that allows veterans to access private care if VA care isn't expedient enough. They have dedicated centers for OIF/OEF vets who just come out, they have dedicated centers for women, they have dedicated centers for physical rehabilitation. And despite being a massive bureaucracy, they do some things really good: Chronic illnesses like diabetes or life-threatening diseases like cancer have good outcomes within the VA, with high patient satisfaction with the delivery and convenience of care.\n\nSo, what the fuck gives, right? Why did this one veteran commit suicide outside of the VA when there were a lot of good things about it? It can't just be he felt bad for his brothers and sisters in arms - there had to be something else going on.\n\nAmong the many problems the VA faces in addressing individual issues is that there is a lack of manpower. They can't pro-actively reach out to individuals if they fall off the radar by not regularly showing up to their appointments. The VA also can't provide the social network a person needs to survive in this life in between appointments (at least, not yet). They also can't call every veteran there ever was and say, "Hey, how are you doing?" And they can't fix any problems themselves; patients also need to be willing to fix what they're going through. That last part is difficult because if you're depressed and suicidal, you're probably withdrawn and can't think of a solution to get you out of the funk - and that's assuming you're self-aware enough to realize you have a problem. \n\nThere are issues about bureaucratic paperwork issues. Ugh, it's frustrating as fuck - I filed a claim about two months ago, and even though I have help with it, there is bureaucratic paperwork for nearly every step. And you don't know, sometimes, which paper is needed when. So I end up filling them all lol But waiting on motherfucking paperwork shouldn't kill anyone! And it won't! \n\nThat's because at the VA, you can walk into any one of them at any time and say, "DUDE, I'm in real trouble," and you'll find a department just for that. The problem isn't the damn paperwork. The problem isn't the people at the VA. The problem is the lack of manpower - maybe not enough people, maybe the people are run inefficiently, but it's all still a lack of manpower. But manpower - it's the biggest contributing factor; the largest common denominator, in any veteran suicide.  \n\nSo action points for the VA:\n\n- Find ways to proactively find veterans. This means home visits. This means phone calls. This means hiring a lot of people with Masters degrees in Family Therapy or Bachelors in psychology just to check in. The most effective homeless campaigns here in Southern California utilize home visits by psych-bachelors all the time. \n\n- Treat veteran suicide like you do with homelessness: Literally, go out into the community and find them. \n\n- Do not let suicide-prone individuals slip through the cracks for more than a month! My undergraduate research reveals a strong link between lack of social networks and homelessness and veteran suicides - and one month is the magic number.\n\n- Help create a community: A lot of community-oriented projects are at the VA or their many clinics. It needs to look off campus to find ways of sponsoring privately-held community events. There are some, but not nearly enough, and I chalk this up to manpower problems again.\n\n- In the vein of community, increase the number of vet centers - even if they're smaller and less robust in services. Social networks analysis stresses the importance of the number of weak ties being more effective than a few strong ties. More less-featured vet centers also means more places for veterans to be engaged with their community - and they need to be places that both homeless AND adjusted people WANT to go to (my suggestions would be holding community events. :)\n\n- These said vet centers would also be a great staging point for sending out bachelor degree holding people into the community much more easily. \n\n----\nThanks for reading my stream of consciousness :) I fell through the cracks of the VA more than once. It takes a lot to get a person to the right spot. I couldn't have done it without my family pushing me to the VA. Not all vets have that. We need to address that, and it isn't just asking if they're feeling suicidal during their checkups. \n\n
I was a medic. I was also assigned to Camp Bucca where we regularly housed detainees - a military euphemism for prisoners. It fucking boggles my mind how often much better we treated the **enemy** better than some of our own citizens. If you drop over to /r/protectandserve, I readily and easily see opinions that discount our value. \n\n>What a bunch of posers and whiners.\n\nFrom this [thread about Spec4s and Lance Corporals](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/36fxjo/rarmy_on_limiting_military_style_equipment_for/cre2xmy)\n\nI once had to stitch up a legit Al-Qaeda guy because he fought another prisoner. We treated him better than this guy. When someone legitimately said they were having medical problems, I was johnny-on-the-spot to fix it. We subdued the person, like the officers did in this video, but only escalated force as necessary. The officers in this video kept escalating and lacked providing medical attention - something as simple as fucking giving adequate water or getting him to higher medical staff. Yes, they got him a nurse. But when you're fucking sitting there for over an hour with multiple problems and you notice a nurse isn't doing shit and they really cry out in pain, without fighting, you are now complicit in the man's death. That's because it isn't just your job to have people comply, but also to make sure they're alive to have justice done. If you can't see a person through life to have justice done, you've failed, and failed justice overall.
I'm a die-hard Marxist. Yet... reading his translations to English make me wish I was reading Shakespeare in high school instead. I wonder if his German writing was any better.
It's actually not that unusual to read from a professor's work.\n\nHere's a sample of books I've read from the professor who authored and taught the class:\n\n* Rumbaut - "Race and Ethnicity in America"  for Sociology "Race and Ethnicity"\n* Solingen - "Nuclear Logics" for  PoliSci "Nuclear Proliferation"\n* Bandelj - "Economic Sociology" for Economic Sociology \n\n\nSo... not that weird. In fact, if they are considered pre-eminent in their field, they should have a collection of work that's peer-reviewed and respected. I'm not sure if your professor is either or, but considering he's the chair, it's likely he knows a thing or two. \n\nHaving said that, the work does sound like it's racists and imperialism apologia. What school do you attend? I once did a seminar at Harvard, where the professor started spouting BS like this, and when I challenged him, I was almost kicked out of the program.  :) \n\nYou should take the course. He's not the only one who has his views. By understanding his rationale, you get to understand the millions of other reactionaries in our society. You can create better counter arguments, and in the process, know yourself better. School is about challenging oneself in directions that are uncomfortable.
This deserves more upvotes. Yet... I'm not surprised it's being downvoted. I suspect that for Filipinos in the Philippines, the plight of their FilAm comrades is immaterial. My Tito once put it to me like this, "[Filipinos] think once you make it to America, you've made it." \n\nWithout discounting the realities of my brethren still living in the motherland (which are pretty harsh - I mean, a sizeable number make less than $2/day!), allow me to present some things FilAms don't have. \n\nWhile yes, we tend to have access to good schools, our parents' purchasing power is greater and the neighborhoods are arguably better - we miss the one most important thing about being Filipino. **Our culture.**\n\nWhen the Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese or Koreans settle in the US, they make their little enclaves. It's not uncommon for them to go to "Chinese/Japanese schools" on Sundays to read up their culture and learn the motherland's tongue. "Little Saigon" or "Little Tokyo" or "Koreatown" are familiar monikers in America - but *Little Manila*? It's nearly unheard of. \n\nSo - what's the point of being Filipino when you know nothing about  your culture? How are you told to be Filipino when no one teaches you? How can you connect to your family in the Philippines when your parents don't speak Tagalog to you?\n\n I suppose from the outside, it would seem like, "Who cares? Just be American." *It's not so easy.*\n\nBeing a full-fledged member of American society requires you to be white. Otherwise, you're a minority. As such, you're granted such privileges like lower pay, segregated from well-performing schools and occasional passive-aggressive hostility. These effects have a detrimental affect not only on a person's psyche (how would you like to be treated like a second class citizen?), but it also affects one's life chances - their ability to get a good job, get married, etc.\n\nOf course as your social and economic status increases, you'll be treated better, but never as well as the whites. Therefore, consciously or unconsciously, FilAms never feel at 'home.' \n\nI had the fortunate chance to study race and ethnicity with a prominent scholar, and one thing he showed me was that individuals who are well-integrated into their minority's culture tend to be better citizens. Mexicans who felt a lot of pride tended to have better jobs and life satisfaction. That same with Blacks and the Chinese. (He hadn't studied Filipinos, but I think we can apply the conclusions) Meanwhile, those who tried to become 'white washed' tended to be less happy overall. \n\nFilAms, I would propose, suffer a cultural double-whammy: One, not being fully accepted as being Filipino (I've been told on many occasions with a dismissive look, 'You're not Filipino'). And two, never being 'truly' American because you're not white.\n\nI think this is why a lot of Filipinos follow Hip-Hop culture in America. It's a sub-culture for those who don't feel enfranchised by either White Americans and fellow Filipinos - they begin to identify with a group that's been historically oppressed by the whites. That is black culture (whatever that broad term connotes). Alas, that is moving away from the topic at hand...\n\nMy point is that FilAms have real issues with identity and culture, and Filipinos should make a greater effort to help bridge the gap. 
There are two separate issues, and are the symptoms of capitalism. \n\nThe symptoms present as the **crisis of production** for economic depression and environmental disaster because businesses are accountable to their bottom line, not the environment that they live in, or the people businesses are suppose to employ.\n\nProblem with SocDems is that they fail to see how capitalism causes people to chase the dollar. Companies make too much stuff, and thus, they have an over-abundance. This leads to dropping demand, dropping prices and eventually in order to keep companies solvent, they must offload their highest production cost: Human labor. The lack of employed people with money going into their pockets thus drops aggregate demand, which further drops the sales of companies. \n\nEventually, companies come back and grow as they trim the fat and become more efficient - in fact, depressions are excellent times for companies to institute new technologies to replace the people they laid off. Robots and computers are much cheaper than people. (As an aside, this is why American society is bifurcating into two economic spheres: the people who own/run the robots and computers, and those who don't and are forced to do low-wage service jobs)\n\nA heavily regulated capitalist market will still have these problems, but the problems won't be felt as readily: Generous bailout packages for companies, tight regulation of speculative markets, and moderate pension handouts to help people weather the storm and increase demand. It doesn't sound bad, but people still pay for it - these economic depressions are the cause of many of society's suicides and mental depression.\n\nIn terms of the environment, heavily regulated industries can be curbed in a capitalistic society. This usually requires a huge culture change within a company to put people, animals and ecology before profit. Plus, government needs to have adequate regulatory staff and powers. I hope you can see the problems here: Profit will eventually win out over people, animals and ecology because chasing money is a fundamental feature of capitalism. \n\nEven a progressive company like Apple who has zero-carbon emission plants still source their materials from smaller companies who rip open mountains for rare minerals, and that isn't even mentioning the dubious labor practices that can slip from under them. \n\nPlus, in terms of regulation, there is often a **revolving door** between industry and government. You cannot necessarily trust it to prosecute companies for dumping things into the environment. Companies, with their massive capital reserves, will hire the best lawyers. And they will send some of their executives into the government to 'advise.' We mustn't look further than Eric Holder who failed to prosecute the banks which caused the 2008 crisis; and after leaving office, is now getting a pretty stipend from Wall Street.\n\n-----\n\n**summary**\n\nSorry if this is too long in the tooth! Remember that **capitalism skews human behavior to search for money** which leads to a *crisis of overproduction* and *companies willing to destroy environment because they're powerful enough to do so*\n

I have another question.\n\nI was traveling through the countryside (read: provinces, specifically between Manila and San Jose) and saw a lot of buildings that said the farming were Co-op owned. Obviously, some means of production was given back to the workers. Yet, judging from internet conversations and the general appearance of the buildings, something went awry. \n\nWhat happened to the effort to co-op worker movement in the Philippines? When did it start? When did it die? Did douchebags ruin it?

*Modern Japan: Second Edition* by Peter Duus (1998) gives a nice summary from 1800-1990s.\n\nOn the period before the restoration and written differently than many historical books, Romulus Hillsborough's *Samurai Tales* (2010) is a good read.\n\nBito Masahide's *The Edo Period: Early Modern and Modern in Japanese History* (2006) will also have relevant information for what you're looking for. 
Before Japan's opening to other Western countries in 1853, Dutch presence in Nagasaki was to a large extent important to Japanese growth.\n\n*Rangaku* or 'Dutch learning', was the transmission of knowledge passed on from the Dutch to their Japanese counterparts from the 1640s until the 1850s. Through *Rangaku*, the Japanese were given information regarding scientific discoveries, technological developments and theory of knowledge. Although *rangaku* was restricted for a good part, the information obtained by the Japanese were very important. An example would be the Western medical and anatomical studies that proved to be more accurate than what the Japanese had learned on their own or obtained from China. \n\nNote that this cultural exchange went the other way as well. For example, although Dutch botanical texts were highly prized in Japan, the level of accuracy in the Japanese illustrations of their own plants proved to be extremely valuable for botanists in Europe (most famously Von Siebold). This cultural exchange highlights the importance of the relationship Holland had with Japan.\n\nDespite the vast amounts of knowledge obtained through Dutch contacts, Edo Japan developed politically and economically without Western models. An example is the fishery industry of the Matsumae domain near Hokkaido. As David Howell notes:\n\n\n"The Hokkaido fishery stands out in the history of the Japanese economy because the fundamental transformation to capitalism was complete *before* the establishment of a regime dedicated to Western-style economic development"\n\nThe rapid growth of Japan's development in the Meiji era can be attributed to both Tokugawa policies as well as *Rangaku*. However, *Rangaku* certainly gave an important boost to the Japanese most especially in the sciences.\n\nI hope this provides some insight.\n\n\nSources:\n\n*Japanese Economic History 1600-1960: The Japanese Economy in the Tokugawa Era, 1600-1868* edited by Michael Smitka\n\n\n*Revisiting the History of Dutch-Japanese Relations* edited by F. Matsukata and F. Cryns\n\n
A number of the mainstream historiography (in the English language at least) takes a reductive approach into colonial Korea, seeing their domestic issues as struggles of being 'pro' or 'anti' Japanese. However, it was not necessarily that clear. For example, Chang Chiyon, a leading editor for the paper *Hwangsong sinmun*, was, like many Asian observers at the time, impressed with Japanese reforms. He promoted reforms through his editorials to follow similar lines of Japanese achievements. In 1904 he even imagined an East Asian Alliance of Korea, Japan and China against Russia. However, Chang swung the other way once Japan 'broke Korea's trust' by its imposition of protectorate status. His scathing attack in 1905 got him arrested and within two years Japanese restrictions did increase on Korean publications.\n\nYet the colonisation of Korea was not necessarily a clear, long-term Meiji goal from the start, as contended by scholars such as Duus. In *Abacus and the Sword*, he states that colonisation decisions took place due to complex agencies, from journalists to businessmen, uniting the Meiji leaders to take action. Duus looks at economic and political forces at play, pushing the 'Korean question' to the top agenda of foreign policy. Duus acknowledges that the Japanese decision makers defined Koreans through derogatory means to help justify their 'guidance'. This could have been projected under various themes. Hygiene was one of the themes to promote Japanese progress and create the 'other' in the colony, as presented by Henry in *Sanitising Empire*.\n\nIn *The Japanese Colonial Empire, 1895-1945*, Ching-chih Chen's article on the police and community control system outline some of the methods in which Japan organised its administration in Korea. Propaganda naturally played an important role, as the established Korean Colonial Cinema Unit spread policies of 'Japanisation'.\n\nI hope this provides some insight and interesting thoughts.\n\n\nSources:\n\n*Colonialism and the Korea Problem in the Historiography of Modern Japan: A Review Article* by Andre Schmid\n\n*Korean Cinema During the Colonial Period* by Hyongshin Kim

Maybe the lawyer is actually the real mastermind behind all this and is trying to get some personal publicity with this case by pushing Matt to make exorbitant demands and giving him false hopes. Hoss seems deluded and not too bright, and that's exactly why he is vulnerable to manipulative lawyers like that. I don't think Matt deserves all this online hate because the lawyer's most likely the one pulling the strings.
The Congress of Vienna (1815) convened towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars and Austria & Prussia emerged as rivals. For the German states, this resulted in the disbandment of the old Holy Roman Empire in favour of a Confederacy with Austria holding the presidency (albeit limited authority). The Confederacy was designed to maintain stability in central Europe and structured to not become a nation. Pushed forth by Metternich, the Austrians wanted to restrict Prussia and put an end to the growing forces of liberalism and nationalism. During this period (1815-30), censorship increased and many liberals were arrested. The Carsblad Decrees of 1819 were the set of laws the Confederacy issued to strengthen the conservative response.\n\nHowever, in 1848 the calls for change resulted in a series of revolutions across the continent. Liberal ideas from the French Revolution influenced a growing middle class that became disillusioned with protectionist barriers, limited freedom of press, the lack of a constitution and assemblies among other reasons. The revolution hit Austria very hard, which forced the abdication of Metternich.\n\nIn the German states, revolutionaries such as Gustav Struve attempted unification through the Frankfurt Parliament (1848) without Austria (the so-called 'lesser solution'). The March Demand in Mannheim called for freedom of press, public jury courts and a Pan-German parliament. However the movement failed as there was a lack of cohesion amongst political groups. The Prussian king Frederick William IV was offered to rule but he rejected the offer and therefore an imperial constitution could not be made. In the spring months of 1849 there were further clashes but the revolutionaries were put down. By June, the Baden Republic was ended by Prussia and Wurttemberg.\n\nAlthough the 1848 attempt failed to unify the German states, they did establish future goals for democracy and unification. It also strengthened the 'lesser solution' and ended feudalism. However, many emigrated to the United States and monarch powers were consolidated.\n\nNot only did the 1848 revolution damage Austria, but so did the war with France & Piedmont in 1859. Additionally, her empire included many religious and ethnic minorities particularly in Hungary. Austria's protectionist economy also did not result in a boom seen in the north under the zollverein ('customs union') that Prussia started. The Prussians, meanwhile, were strengthened following the Congress of Vienna as they gained more territory; they enjoyed ethnic and religious unity for the most part and underwent military reforms set out by the likes of Von Moltke. In 1850 the Prussians did attempt their own northern union (Erfurt) however succumbed to Austrian pressure to return to the Confederacy following the Olmutz agreement--a win for the Austrians.\n\nFurther down the pipeline after Bismarck rose to prominence in Prussia, the Seven Weeks War (1866) broke out with Austria over administration qualms in the northern territories gained after a war with Denmark (1865). Austria was utterly defeated at the Battle of Sadowa and the Treaty of Prague laid out the terms for a new North German Confederacy under Prussia. Austria was not allowed to join in any German organisation thereby effectively ending any involvement for a 'greater solution' of unification.\n\nIn conclusion, the Congress of Vienna pitted Austria and Prussia against each other with neither seeking to collaborate. The conservative nature of the Austrian government meant that no effort was made from their part and it forced the end of any liberal attempts at unification. Prussia, with the zollverein, military reforms and greater hegemony, were much stronger than an Austria weakened by the 1848 revolution, war with France & Piedmont and the lack of reforms. The Seven Weeks War was well-timed for Prussia as it happened alongside the Italian unification wars. The 1848 revolution pushed for a 'lesser solution' that was established further in the 1866 Treaty of Prague. \n\nI hope this helps.\n\nSources:\n*The Wars of German Unification* by Dennis Showalter\n\n*Place and Politics: Local Identity,Civic Culture and German Nationalism in North Germany during the Revolutionary Era* by Katherine Aaslestad\n\n*Austria, Prussia and the Making of Germany: 1806-1871* by John Breuilly\n\nEdit: Word choice and format
Extreme oversimplification, but I'll try to be concise.\n\nIn Italy's case, the aftermath of WW1 left many in despair. The country was still experiencing historical class conflict and the war compounded other issues like inflation and debt. The liberal gov't did little to help those people and consequently this period saw mass emigration. Mussolini, who started out as a socialist, began to formulate ideas that we would later call fascist. Between 1919-20, lots of riots occurred which saw galvanised nationalists attack socialists. From this period onwards, Mussolini and his blackshirt followers targeted socialist offices, local councils and trade unions. The gov't did little to nothing to stop them. In 1922, Mussolini marched on Rome with a large number of followers, many of whom were liberals initially, which forced the king to ask Mussolini to form a new gov't. From then on, fascism overran the country and freedoms were cut, non-fascist groups banned and opponents imprisoned.\n\nAs for Germany, the country also faced desperate circumstances after the war. The new liberal gov't was afraid of losing power to a growing leftist movement and used paramilitary force to maintain order. The most famous instance being the Spartacist uprising in 1919, which saw Rosa Luxemburg murdered.  Even though Leftist parties maintained presence in the Reichstag, they did nothing to upset the establishment. Hitler, who took control of the Nazis in 1921, took advantage of the declining state of the economy and fanned hatred against minority groups. His brownshirt thugs suppressed groups the Nazis were against but he still couldn't force his way to gov't even though the Nazis gained more popularity by 1932. However, the gov't at the time believed Hitler shared the same goals as them so they made him chancellor in 1933.
One of my favourite shows ever. It's the only time I re-watched a series in a short time.
Regarding the Dutch East Indies (which was Indonesia, they weren't two separate entities), we have to reframe the events in the context of the time. Naturally in hindsight there are patterns we could observe, but before the full American embargo of 1941, there weren't serious plans to invade Southeast Asia. Discussions on Southeast Asia in the previous years were made by associations like the *Nannyo Kyokai* or some small navy circles, but the decision to invade was--in the grand scheme of things--a rather last minute choice. To say that Japan didn't attack the USSR again due to their plans for Southeast Asia isn't entirely accurate in the context of the time (before 1941). \n\nIndeed as the war went on after 1941, Japan wouldn't have attacked because of their commitments elsewhere.
I really like The Tudors but it may not have enough fighting if that's what you're searching for
I've only started watching the new Conservative scene on youtube etc. and Shapiro is certainly up there with the twats. The worst is, he disguises his faulty facts and arguments by speaking quickly and distracting listeners with diversion tactics. It must be something he learned at law school and granted he utilises the technique quite well-- yet if one were to listen to his points carefully they could easily refute them. \n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, Shapiro loves to throw statistical facts around as if they are all you need to understand the issue. He never makes the effort to understand *why* certain groups are targeted, are suffering etc. He points to the numbers and concludes 'These people made their own mistakes.' Whether or not he's aware of it, his conclusions are often racist at worst or extremely ignorant at best. For someone who loves facts, Shapiro doesn't bother doing research on, for example, what socialism is or that trans people are real (he simply called them mentally ill).\n\nFurthermore, he's full of contradictions. One moment he will say that he's in full support of the freedom of press, but then he gets upset with something like a homosexual ad featuring Bert & Ernie. He blames 'the left' for pursuing identity politics but that's what he does when he homogenises 'the left'. He claims to follow logic and rationality but denounces any non-Judeo-Christian person for not being able to have any sense of morality. He picks on liberal media like the Daily Show for their cheap gags but he does the same when talking about people on his show. Not to mention how he's so hypocritical in his 'surprise' with the rise of Trump, who is exactly the kind of "self-made" white man that Republican America and Fox News have been idealizing and praising for years...\n\nIt surprises me that so many people follow him and take his words as gospel. Conservative pundits like Shapiro are what's dangerous with political discussions today. He's nothing more than a propaganda mouth piece--he gets sponsored by corporations to spew this bullshit and even if he did change his mind now, he couldnt go back on what he's said before, as he's already made a name for himself by promoting this specific set of ideas. Shapiro is a certified douche bag and Steven Crowder a certified assclown. \n\n/rant over
Theory is my praxis.
But I have. What do I do now?
The Trotsky of our time. Bolshevik once again. Lead us to revolution! 
Yes, jews and roma people should not hate people that fetishize with their genocide. \n\nI mean, we are almost white skin. Love trumps hate.
It was intentional, ahah. Proud that someone spotted it.
Well I don't really subscribe to the whole bloodline thing but sure, we're happy. No less privileged tho obviously I'm still a white guy. 
In my family was easy and it was based on material conditions. Our house was expropriated by the State, we lost the 50k to buy it and we lost our home. Like that.\n\nThen we have problems getting a job for being Roma.\n\nThis is our drive to achieve socialism. To have a home. To have a job. To be part of a society and not being marginalized.\n\nBut I believe that the Roma community is moving in the right direction. We are still a small fraction of us that are pursuing higher education but we will lead the way. \n\nThe State created guetos and you never know when some gipsys will use the ballot box to win those councils and start expropriating left and right. Roma Commune. Wait for it, comrades.
Lenin made the distinction between socialism and communism, comrade. \n\nOthers did not. To be a ML you should know that.
Trump is Yeltsin-ish. Serves the same geopolitical purpose, the same economical purpose, etc.
State and Revolution is great for understanding the dictatorship of the proletariat advanced by Lenin.\n\nValue, Price and Profit by Karl Marx is great for grasping a basic understanding of capital circulation. \n\nYou can read State and Revolution first. \n\nBut regarding Das Kapital, [Value, Price and Profit by Marx](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/) should be read first because it gives you the bases to understand a book that is very dense.
What happens if country Y, per example, implements a labour voucher system and breaks with capital circulation? What happens to a country that breaks with capitalism but hasn't yet reached a stateless society but has reached a classless and moneyless society? \n\nIs it a petty-bourgeois elite society, where the wealth and the means of production are shared but there isn't a international revolution, so they aren't socialists?
How did you construct that point of view regarding social democracy in China? 
Google search on Lenin's New Economic Policy. \n\nBut the discussion goes further than this. Lenin made a separation between socialism and communism. Other's did not.\n\nSocialism is the construction of communism.

Today we have the internet, which would make the communications much faster and the data collecting and its organization much more faster and effective also, which allows us to implement a proper network for planning the economy to achieve the highest efficiency. \n\nKnowing in real time what the councils need and what they are producing is something that can make the economical planning much easier. 
Moral lessons from a country where half the population is poor.\n\nAnd if Venezuela pays lip service to Socialism, it's time to pursue a socialist state apparatus. \n\nAlso, today we have technological advancements in agricultural farming that can make a huge difference on an economy.
What are the differences between Stalin and Trotsky?\n\n1 . Imagine not needing to destroy food because of food prices, like many producers do. And so on.\n\n2 . Search George Lucas on Soviet Union.\n\n3 . By planning the economy. Today we have the technology to do it very fast, very precisely and on a massive scale.\n\n4 . For me it's a luxury to go out once a month. Socialising it's an luxury. It's a luxury to have access to the internet. It's a luxury to go out for dinner. And so on. Economical freedom is much more than buying a television.\nThere are things whose main purpose is to demonstrate to which social class you belong, like a Ferrari, and to imagine their purpose after class abolition is a good exercise. Maybe it will be like in Cuba where their priceless cars are just cars.
Check *Manufacturing Consent* by Chomsky. It's not what they tell you, it's how they tell you.\n\nChina has a regime, America has a democracy. Syria has regime forces, America has milliary and police. Libya had suppression by the regime, America disperses demonstrators.\n\nEtc, etc. We, as Marxists, have to use dialectical materialism to better understand our material conditions.
You have to do what it takes, reaching Berlin, Korea, like the USSR did. Reaching Angola, South Africa and Namibia, like Cuba did. The revolution is international and the next big marxist country needs to go further.
It's fundamental - if the true objective is to achieve a revolution and not pursue it through lip service - to uphold democratic centralism. Freedom in discussion, unity in action.  \n\nThe bolsheviks had Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Bukharin, Molotov, were all brilliant people, probably with disagreements, but they united in a fundamental cause: Revolution.\n\nPeople that form parties and afterwords split and form another and so on, and so on, are just playing. It's a nice hobby, I suppose. But it's not revolutionary. It might feel good to fetishise with historical events but it will non the less maintain the present social order, and the current state apparatus that represses the workers.\n\nWorkers of the world. Please unite. 
Robespierre did nothing wrong. Kulaks deserved worse.
Which East? The Eastern Bloc is nostalgic for the socialist period and simultaneously are aligned to the West because they feel secure by doing so. They would probably follow the same path as the west.\n\nAs for the socialist imperialism, if we already have socialists that advocated for foreign intervention in some countries. Which is essentially admitting that there are countries whose working class doesn't have revolutionary potential, like Libya. And don't subscribe to the anti-imperialist struggle of some countries. Now imagine if they have control of the American state apparatus. 
The poverty measure, according to the world bank, is 1.9$/day. They can manage to eradicate poverty. They are the major responsible for the world poverty reduction.\n\n [China’s socialist model outperforms capitalism](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1002098.shtml)\n\nThe top four fastest growing economies since the neo-liberal "Washington Consensus" was put forward all follow, or are highly influenced by, China's development model. These countries are China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. In contrast, capitalist development models, including the Washington Consensus, have been a failure. Pro-capitalists in China would clearly prefer these facts to be generally unknown since they damage the idea that China should abandon its socialist path of development and adopt a capitalist one.\n\n\n\nIn order to assess the competing strategies, we will consider China itself as well as three other countries. These are Vietnam, which defines itself as socialist and drew heavily from China's socialist market economy approach, and Cambodia and Laos, both of which were highly influenced by China's development model.\n\n\n\nFrom 1993-2015, China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos ranked, respectively, No.1, No.2, No.3 and No.4 in world per capita GDP growth - peripheral cases of countries with populations of less than 5 million or dominated by oil production are not included. From 1989 to 2015 China, Vietnam and Laos ranked, respectively, No.1, No.2 and No.3 in the world for countries in per capita GDP growth. And from 1978 onwards China ranked No.1 among all economies in terms of economic growth.\n\n\n\nThe contrasts not only in average per capital GDP growth but also in the eradication of poverty are similarly overwhelming. **Since 1981 China has lifted 728 million people out of World Bank-defined poverty. Vietnam lifted over 30 million people from poverty by the same criteria.** In the rest of the world, in which the dominant model advocated by the IMF was the Washington Consensus, only roughly 120 million people rose above poverty. **During this time, 83 percent of all poverty reduction was in China, 85 percent was in socialist countries and only 15 percent was in capitalist countries.** \n\n\n\nThis data breaks down the claim that capitalism is the main drive behind rapid economic growth and poverty reduction. If capitalism were the motor of economic growth and poverty reduction, then growth would be the most rapid, and poverty reduction the largest, in capitalist countries. Instead it is in China and Vietnam that the greatest poverty reduction has taken place and in China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos where the fastest economic growth has occurred. \n\n\n\nThe facts show that China's policies, which included a dominant role by the State sector, large-scale plans to eradicate poverty and a socialist political orientation, are successful in producing both economic growth and poverty reduction. \n\n\n\nThe simple fact that the top four most rapidly growing economies since the Washington Consensus was outlined all use the Chinese socialist development model demonstrates of the superiority in China's path to capitalist alternatives.
Back in the 70's, Salvador Allende with the technology that was available was able to monitor the country's economy and plan it according to the information. \n\nhttps://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/allende-chile-beer-medina-cybersyn/\n\nToday we have much more and better technology to manage resources. 
Only utter imbeciles would be capable of thinking that capitalist relations, that is to say, the private ownership of the means of production, including the land, can be reestablished in the USSR by peaceful methods and lead to the régime of bourgeois democracy.\n\nLeon Trotsky, 1934
ABC of Communism, I think.
The great thing of being a westerner is that you can determine the faith of every other nation. We believe that the working class of every other nation does not have revolutionary potential.\n\nThat's why you have socialists that supported the invasion of Libya, and so on.\n\nThat is why I believe that if a revolution strikes the USA, it will have a domino effect. Just think of the military bases that they have around the world. Imperialism with a human face. 
Where are my Jew friends that call all the shots? George Soros, Rockefeller and Rothschild?\n\nedit - i forgot the /s
Lenin — CEO of Communism — gave me once this advice: *Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement*.\n\nHe told me this while in a coffee break, from a TedTalk I went a few years back.\n\nIf Lenin gives you an advice, for goodness sake LISTEN. Please remember that he was successful, and that advice worked for him.
Look at how Orson Welles was sidelined and sabotaged by Hollywood.
You can see it in Venezuela. The attempt to build socialism within a liberal democracy doesn't work. Trying to build socialism within a liberal democracy doesn't work. Trying to build socialism without class struggle doesn't work. And when the class struggle came... they ate Maduro alive.
I also have some trust issues for that transition, specially now that they are now championing automation. They are on the verge of having the material conditions to achieve the next socialist stage.\n\nThere is a funny dialectic going on in China, the rich people need the Party, so they do not want to get rid of the apparatus that is tremendously successful and that secures their wealth. Can we say that the Party feels the same way about rich people, having the ability to expropriate them?\n\nLike Alibaba and their Elon Musk-ish owner, they are praised in the west but they also acknowledge that the Communist Party can expropriate them if they feel that is necessary. \n\nAnd is this a scenario of how to transition or when to do it? The *how* is simple on an abstract form. The land is all owned by the State and the Party has the power to seize the means of production and return them to the workers.\n\nWhen? I feel like the *when* is soon. They are championing high tech, renewable energies, 3D printing and now automation - the global economy is even dependent on China to proceed with technological developments for diverse reasons. The USSR, per example, was outpaced by the West in technological development. In China that does not occur and the West is even dependent on China for that manner. \n\nThey have quality (ghost) towns, they are turning into electrical cars and modernizing public transportation. \n\nWhat more to break with capital circulation? I would say food. They are trying to break with beef consumption, implementing vertical farming and trying to diversify their alimentation, like making potato a key food element. And also not being dependent on oil consumption.\n\nAnd the Cultural Revolution generation will eventually reach the upper echelons of the Party. 
I tolerate daesh and I'm trying to book them some stages. It's time to give them the death blow. Tolerate and defend them to death.

The institution of slavery is self-evidently evil. 
I know that capital is much more than the ownership of the means of production.\n\nI just gave Trotsky's input on the USSR. \n\nThe best analysis on Soviet economy was made by Stalin where he even approached the Law of Value in the Union. \n\nAs for myself, both Trotsky and Stalin were correct regarding socialism in the Union. Despite Trotsky not making the distinction between socialism and communism that Lenin made and Marxism Leninism upholds since then. Trotsky didn't called it socialism, he called it a degenerate workers state. 
Right when I'm almost ending college. Damn you science. 
The book that I posted above is like the short version of capital written by Marx himself.\n\nI think reading it before Capital is good because it gives you a basic understanding of what you will be reading.\n\nAnd State and Revolution I consider a fundamental work that revolutionary Marxists should read.
Great question, comrade.\n\nThe capitalist class reproduces itself by inheritances and by the Education system. Regarding the Education system, Bukharin explained this:\n\n>In bourgeois society the school has three principal tasks to fulfil. First, it inspires the coming generation of workers with devotion and respect for the capitalist régime. Secondly, it creates from the young of the ruling classes 'cultured' controllers of the working population. Thirdly, it assists capitalist production in the application of sciences to technique, thus increasing capitalist profits.\n\n>In capitalist society the second leading aim of bourgeois education is secured by carefully withholding secondary education and higher education from the working masses. Instruction in the middle schools, and still more in the high schools, is extremely costly, so that it is quite beyond the financial resources of the workers. The course of instruction, in middle and higher education, lasts for ten years or more. For this reason it is inaccessible to the worker and the peasant who, in order to feed their families, are compelled to send their children at a very early age to factory work or field work, or else must make the youngsters work at home. In actual practice, the middle and higher schools are the preserves of bourgeois youth. In them, the younger members of the governing classes are trained to succeed their fathers in careers of exploitation, or to fill the official and technical posts of the capitalist State. In these schools, likewise, instruction has a definitely class character. In the domains of mathematics, the technique of industry, and the natural sciences, this may be less striking; but the class character of the teaching is conspicuous in the case of the social sciences, whereby the pupils' outlook on the world is in reality formed. Bourgeois political economy is inculcated with all the most perfected methods for the 'annihilation of Marx'. Sociology and history are likewise taught from a purely capitalist outlook. The history of jurisprudence concludes with the treatment of bourgeois jurisprudence as the natural right of 'the man and the citizen', etc., etc. To sum up, the higher and middle schools teach the children of the capitalists all the data that are requisite for the maintenance of bourgeois society and the whole system of capitalist exploitation. If any of the children of the workers, happening to be exceptionally gifted, should find their way into the higher schools, in the great majority of instances the bourgeois scholastic apparatus will serve as a means of detaching them from their own class kin, and will inoculate them with bourgeois ideology, so that in the long run the genius of these scions of the working class will be turned to account for the oppression of the workers.
Killing fascists is kind of our specialty, really.

Roma people are being targeted of pogroms in Ukraine so I'm hopping that when he said that he was referring to bringing Roma to a safe place. That's my leap of faith. 
They said that they were anti-austerity but in the end they followed the neoliberal agenda. They didn't even pursue alternatives. They didn't do geopolitics.  \n\nToday I see them as the typical European *socialist* parties that follow neoliberal policies with the fist held high.
Democratic centralism was the left's eureka moment. It's a methodology that makes the seizing of the state possible, even in western countries.\n\nLook at Syriza, they eventually screwed up big time. There was an internal class struggle and the bourgeoisie won. But they were an incubator for left ideologies that seized the state apparatus. \n\nPodemos is on the same path.\n\nThere needs to be attention regarding class struggle within the movement in order to not capitulate. Regardless of that, I think that in America if all the left parties united, they could gain momentum and popularity and eventually seize the state and bring revolution about. They would also have the proper technology to end capital circulation by implementing an electronic labour voucher system. \n\nWe are no longer in the 20th century. We have the proper means of production to implement socialism. We just need revolutionaries.\n\nIf we can't even unite among ourselves, I don't see how we can build a counter hegemonic movement.
He was also an eugenist. Search on the Socialist New Men in a letter to America.\n\nTrotsky... My God. Maybe his heart was in the right place but he was such a Bernie Sanders.
>Food voucher debit cards are a widely accepted form of currency in Venezuela that can be used for purchases in a variety of supermarkets, restaurants, and retail stores. Over 9.7 million Venezuelan workers reportedly benefit from the tickets, amounting to approximately 50% of the working age population (ages 15-65). \n\n\nWhy not break off with capital circulation and implement a labour voucher system? Venezuela doesn't have much to lose at this point.
I would be happy, comrade. \n\nI am a Leninist myself and seeing people dismissing the USSR and other socialist countries as just state capitalist countries is giving validation to those who say that capitalism is a better system and coining the achievements of the USSR, China, Cuba and others to capitalism.
Never forget and never forgive what they did to Allende.

The end goal is not being so dependent on upper echelons. If people know exactly what needs to be produced they are not so dependent on production managers and economists.\n\nAnd when you know that 10X needs to be produced, you know where the surplus starts, and you and your coworkers can keep and manage the surplus. Thus, not being alienated from the product of your labour.

They just need to go further. You can't build socialism in a bourgeois democracy. You can't implement a dictatorship of the proletariat in a bourgeois democracy.\n\nWhat they are doing in Venezuela is amazing and unthinkable but it wont last long if they insist in an apparatus that bases itself in class struggle and the bourgeoisie has the upper hand.
Is that enough? Will that benefit the working class? Is it better than engaging in class war against the bourgeoisie and expropriate them, to say the least?

I don't think we should do anything about the Philippines or Venezuela. But we are directly supporting the war in Yemen through arms, intel, and occasionally our own military operations.

If they go full-communism and expropriate every capitalist and collectivize all private property, the labour voucher system would be a reality. \n\nI would go full Che Guevara and move there to help them.

I was recently on vacation with my family and they left CNN on all day because there wasn't much else to do in the hotel room.

I mean it's good that they're keeping attention on the government, but ffs! That shooting got all of 5 minutes while they repeated talking points for the next 5 hours over and over again.

>So. Via the context of the situation the parents were supposed to have the skills to know what to buy and you brought up the whole thing about the parents of kids who don't have those skills.\n\n>So now you put what did actually happen, they were now allowed to market, as some sort of proof you weren't implying the rule should have stayed to protect the kids of parents without the skills? No.\n\nI really don't understand what you're trying to say, because you've taken my actual point and stretched it in a few different directions to come to your own conclusion. \n\nMy point is simply that you shouldn't market things - especially things that are bad for you, like most of this food - to children. The fact that some parents don't have the 'skills' is one aspect of the problem, but I listed three others as well:\n\n-Kids still get them through schools, which are full of it.\n\n-Kids with healthy diets still get this food from their friends\n\n-Kids who's parents never buy this food still grow up craving the food, as that is the whole point of marketing it. \n\nThere are other social implications as well but these are the points I made. \n\nYou're really pushing this whole 'punishment' angle but you haven't said who you think is being punished. I can only assume you're referring to the marketing companies. Between the two parties involved here, I really don't care about the marketing companies. \n\nPerhaps instead of following this convoluted path you've started us down, you can simply explain why you think it's a good idea to market junk food to children in the first place. After all you do have this backwards - the rule was not imposed as a way to crack down on marketing companies, it was lifted to give marketing companies opportunities that they didn't previously have. ie the exact opposite of a 'punishment' in both cases. 
I get what you mean but there is a difference between being found guilty and actually being guilty. No difference in the eyes of the law tho.
Well Sessions should absolutely be accused and tried for perjury. I don't think anyone is saying he shouldn't. But in this case it would be a pretty quick investigation. The evidence is public. Either it holds or he finds a loophole out of it - but I'm not sure what else needs to be investigated.

I get where he's coming from but the whole 'the only way to end racism is to stop talking about it' thing is just ridiculous. Like, has that ever happened? People just forgot they were racist because they stopped talking about it, and then everything was good? Where did he get that idea from?

I don't think he does - most of his work on Fallout 2 for instance was very post-post-apoc. I think it's a finer line than that - pretty soon there would be very little to distinguish the NCR from pre-war society. Especially without any feasible enemies to stand in their way. That's a step beyond post-post-apoc and I think that's what he wants to avoid. So the universe maintains more of a wild west feel - somewhere in between the stone ages and modern California. 
I'm pretty sure all police departments around the country are mandated to publish a list of arrests with pictures on their websites. And they've been doing it for a long time. I think it should be based in convictions rather than arrests, and I certainly wouldn't like a random newspaper to do that job.
Beautiful music, thanks for posting.
This isn't really the same thing. The rule didn't prevent you from watching cartoons like the pool prevents you from diving off the board. This rule prevented marketing companies from advertising through kid's shows. The comparison doesn't really hold, because this rule was not a 'punishment' for anything. 
You're a liberation theologist, I'm sure we all connected the dots. At least, I'm pretty sure this was the answer you were looking for.

A lot of them were mass constructed very quickly following yhe total destruction of ww2, so it really wasn't intentional. 
This isn't a plugin that you just whip together in a week lol. 
I think so, yes. Because by the time it's being published the criminal is already heading to jail, so no one is in danger. By the time they get out, it's wrong to punish them further because they have paid for their crime. The only way this functions as a PSA is if they publish info while the criminal is at large, which is reasonable IMO
Hmm no it looks like mine is outdated. I have 17.1. I would look into the mods you need it for tho because they may not actually require the latest version yet - Lutana always gets updated faster than other mods can keep up.

No. The thing I think many of you miss is that illegal immigration is a fact of life. You can't stop it, you can only make a fool of yourself and hurt people trying to swing your dick around in the process. People will always move towards favorable economic areas. They'll come to flee oppression, to get away from their family, to connect with a lover, to work, and for any number of other reasons. That's the human will to live in action. That's why so many illegal immigrants come here and find a comfortable niche in society. \n\nHistorically the one thing that has worked to curb immigration in any society, for better or worse, was an improvement of the economic situation in the neighboring nations. That's exactly what is happening in Mexico, and illegal immigration is on a steep decline. Trump simultaneously threatens their economic incentive to move back by threatening insane tariffs and destablizing their economy, and then wants to punish people for coming here where things are more stable. Does that make any sense to you? I have to question if the problem here is really *illegal immigrants* as such - because you're all collectively going to make the problem worse with these plans. It seems like, at least as far as Trump is concerned, the real agenda here is to take jabs at Mexico to stoke up American nationalism.\n\nNow as for those numbers - I'm going to need a source on that. If they are even realistic, it would be important to consider the context as well. It looks like what you've done is post some talking points with no context whatsoever. I addressed this as a primary problem with the list as well - posting things that sound super scary because people don't know how to put them into perspective. So please source your claims and elaborate. \n\nAs for me, I don't have any use for moving to another country illegally because the economic situation here is just fine for me. Like any other person on earth, I'd prefer to stay home where I'm comfortable rather than risk my life and freedom in a place that is hostile to me being there. But if I was left with no other option, I would not sit here and starve. I doubt you would either, unless your sense of sovereignty and patriotism is so strong that it actually overrides evolutionary urges...\n\nAnd even if the country was the dystopic nightmare that some of you claim it is, the concept of singling out an ethnic, religious, or national group is still antithetical to justice. I notice you didn't touch on that point so I'll reiterate: the law is blind to such factors. Being an illegal immigrant doesn't make you any more or less guilty of a crime you've committed, which is why this is all completely irrelevant. This not just baseless idealism, these are the principals on which the country was founded, which Donald Trump supposedly respects. It's one reason people still champion our legal system even with all it's problems: Because these are sound principles. The problems you've laid out (specifically being released after committing a violent crime) should be solved, but that's not what this argument is about. Publishing a list isn't going to solve them and you damn well know that. This isn't even being done for intelligence purposes, this is being publicized to feed a hungry group of paranoid Americans.

My grandpa used to fight my grandma about this, 20 years ago. She would always leave the TV on Fox and get pissed if you changed it. But my grandpa is not a conservative guy and hated listening to their shit all day. Ultimately he lost this fight, and they eventually bought a house with two  living rooms. Now my grandma hangs out in one, and everybody else hangs out in the other. Fox News has literally divided the family. 
It's not legal but it is accurate, they caught it on video.
Do you find that you have more productive conversations when you just talk to yourself in the mirror? 
I know a lot of people who have 2-4 psych degrees. Most of them wanted to do research for a living. Every single one of them now works as an HR rep in a small company at less than $15/hr. It's pretty sad IMO. 
Who's getting punished? 
To be fair she has mellowed out. My dad married an Asian and had a baby, I'm marrying a Mexican and we'll likely have children someday. It's hard to continue being racist when your own flesh and blood isn't white. At the very least, she doesn't talk about shit during dinner anymore because we will straight up walk out on her and not come back for months. And although she does vote republican, grandpa balances that out. He's an old school union guy and his biggest political issue is saving the post office lol.
Does it bother you that other world leaders think our president is dumb? Like, as far as America's image abroad goes.
Oh right, In trumps view they all stop being rapists, murderers, and drug dealers at the precise moment that the US gives them citizenship.
Well one of these things actually happens regularly, the other doesn't. One has a clear and public history of intent, the other doesn't. Potato, pototo though right? 
Yep asset forfeiture and private prisons - hallmark of the 'libertarian' agenda.\n\n(Although FYI Johnson is in New Mexico. We have similarly corrupt politicians here in AZ but they don't actually try to act like freedom fighters lol)
That isn't really that bad. You shouldn't cheat on your spouse at all but compared to the skeletons most powerful people keep, that's nothing. \n\nAlso the reason everybody knows about this is because white power groups were trying to dig up dirt on him to smear his reputation. That was the best they could come up with so they ran with it. And now it's a neat little piece of historical trivia.
Ah I just saw that it's console exclusive. Oh well, I'll just forget about this one now lol.
True but the only way to fix this is to help them, and to prove to them in ways that they understand that these jobs aren't coming back.
Black history is separate from American history because up until recently, black people weren't fully considered a part of American society. \n\nApart from large exceptions like the first black president, things that black people do in this generation likely will be rolled into American history rather than black history. But when we're looking at the time before the civil rights movement, *part* of the history is remembering that black people were indeed excluded from mainstream America. It makes no sense to gloss over that fact - it's an important part of history. 
When this happens to me, I use two pairs of pliers. One on a metal part of the tank, and one on the mod itself. It's always worked so far when one set just doesn't cut it. 
I did, and saw mostly Sandersforpresident posts. 
Oh yeah I know, I was just trying to give a little context.
Hold on here, did you just try to passive-aggressively end the conversation and then *still keep talking*? Like, was I supposed to read that from that point on? You've been nothing but rude since the conversation started, and apparently hostile to the very idea that someone could have a different opinion of this specific issue than you do. Hilarious that you're trying to pull  the 'reading comprehension' shit after you've seemingly been talking to yourself for the past few hours. Whatever lol have a bad day dude. 
Probably yeah it's best to be skeptical. Cause even tho NK is a fucked up place, a lot of people put out inaccurate stuff about them and it doesn't help you understand more about the country, they just make shit up with no proof. The thing about NK is that we know it's bad, but solid proof is hard to come by. A lot of stuff is speculated but made up. 
I mean, he can work in the military without forcing everyone else to join the military. 
'Supporting abortion', in many places, does mean 'abortion being legal'. In other places, it means 'abortion being *fully* legal'. \n\nI apologize for assuming your point of view for you. But you are wrong that being a socialist =/= supporting abortion. The two are intertwined, if anything by virtue of being very pressing and politicized issues that fall to the left. 
This thread is just full of lofty idealism.\n\nLook dude, I think America will survive this shitpost. 
They did actually sell a hard-cover book of AMA's one time, which was literally a reselling of content posted by users and celebrities. A lot of people were pretty pissed about it. \n\nIf they tried to rip off your writingprompts fiction and sell *that*, or sell some of your original art, I'm sure it would be a much different story. I don't see them doing that. 
Oh thanks for explaining. I guess I actually didn't know what all of those terms technically meant. I totally get what you mean now. 
It's a lot like lo-fi psychobilly:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHe4_fKCzXU&list=PLfR7aWEUsskU8pcjh77gVi8eHApbISO7i\n\nExcept on an acoustic guitar. \n\nPsychobilly is a sub-genre of rockabilly, which is basically greaser music. Psychobilly tends to have more of a punk influence and focuses on grittier, and sometimes  supernatural themes. 
Well he appreciates the concept of a deer more than you, so case closed. 
When Trump speaks of his children, he refers to them of extensions of himself. That is cut and dry ASPD behavior - I don't know of anything else that makes people act like that.
If anybody needs a copy before they reupload it, PM me. 
Well first of all, singling out a specific group like that is completely antithetical to the concept of justice. Their nationality, religion, skin color, etc have no bearing whatsoever on their criminal or non-criminal behaviors, so highlighting those factors is a clear attempt at drawing an association between crime and a totally unrelated factor. If you tried to do that in a court of law it would be clear racially motivated bias and it would not stand. Those factors are irrelevant. \n\nSecond of all, the public has a problem with optics and perception on issues like these. Trump could publish a list of 100 crimes committed in the last few months by immigrants, and without proper context it might scare the hell out of people. But in proper context, you'd realize that 100 people out of millions is statistically irrelevant. But that's beside the point for people like Trump, because this is not simply a public service announcement, it's an attempt to draw parallels between nationality and crime. \n\nLastly, this information is already available. To the best of my knowledge, every arrest in the country is put up online mere hours after the fact. If people were seriously concerned about this and wanted that information, it's already available. And that's fine. The difference between that and this is that this list doesn't give you the full picture; it's curated and targeted against specific groups. \n\nThere's a reason that Hitler did this. It was one step in a long term strategy to divide Germans from Jews and dehumanize Jews. That was literally his intent and there isn't any ambiguity there. What, then, is Trump's purpose? 
Put political pressure on our governments to try and sort out the problem, perhaps. In the case of Yemen? That shit could be stopped by the US tomorrow if we elected people who care. 
If it isn't the game of the decade, I don't know what I'm going to do because The Witcher left a big gaping hole in my heart that no other video game can fill. I need this hype tbh. 
I could definitely see that happening - fits in more with the 50's aesthetic and it explains the raider's fashion choices. 
A lot of parents dont. Screw those kids right? \n\nIt's not just the grocery store. They serve that at school too. Their friends will have it. In general theyll grow up craving that shit whether or not mom and dad had it around the house. These companies have spent billions ensuring that. 
Where else do people live?
You won't be disappointed with Fargo. 
He cut cheap, effective social services while massively expanding things that republicans like. His economics were just handouts to large capitalists. The small government bullshit is a load of rhetoric and nothing else.
Wikipedia is a compilation of information. Read the article and look at their sources.
And doing a really bad job. This guy does not seem cut out to be doing this kind of thing.
You're being ridiculously mellow dramatic and there's no point in discussing anything with you if you're just going to speak in hyperbole. 
We've reached that point in the story where we need a healthy ass kicking. Just buy us a beer afterwords and we'll all be grateful.
Gotcha. Would you be concerned at all about the ruling party in Syria if not for the war? 
Let me ask you this: Who was the last major world leader to suggest nuking anybody or anything? 
Based on this articles and others, this feud doesn't seem to have anything at all to do with the pedophilia issue. Not that you're wrong, but the political climate in the church is pretty much bipartisan on that one. 
Yeah I was using a tfv4 for awhile and it was the same. It'd look pretty black and saturated but keep working for the rest of the week. 
What specifically is so bad about her lifestyle tho
Warren just wouldn't win a presidential election. Nor does she want to, afaik. 
There's very little doubt IMO that that quest in Far Harbor was ripped directly from [Autumn Leaves](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50146/?). If you play both of them, it's pretty clear. The level design is basically identical. And while the plot in AL is a lot more complex than the FH quest, they follow the same basic outline too. The only difference is that the FH quest is much shorter, doesn't pose any interesting philosophic questions through the narrative, and is really a PG13 version of the actual story. \n\nNow, I've seen video game developers do worse... But why in the hell would they do this? It's just such a tacky move to plagiarize just because you can do it without repercussion. The guy behind Autumn Leaves put years of work into that mod just to create something cool. They released a near perfect version of it the very first time it was uploaded, and did it years after New Vegas modding had mostly died down. It's an amazing work of interactive fiction and a fantastic addition to the New Vegas lore. Then here comes Bethesda, dumbing it down, repackaging it, and not giving any shred of credit or kudos to the author who spent years actually making it. And they did it all for some throw away side quest. That doesn't inspire much confidence in me at all. \n
Well you're missing a few  crucial pieces of history here and some minor ones. \n\nThe original Fallout 3 was called Van Buren - in between it's cancellation and the official Fallout 3 there was Fallout Tactics and a spinoff Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. But the biggest thing missing here is the entirety of New Vegas lol
I don't blame you for not wanting to argue the subject here. But my problem is that a great many of Christian and Catholic people in the west want to restrict or outright outlaw abortion. Because this threat is still alive and well, I can't agree that it's a simple issue of dogs vs. cats. Y'know? But I appreciate that we can perhaps come together on many other issues. 
This is really cool but I'm confused - that doesn't look like a glacier at all. 
They're never going to get a new engine. Upgrades, sure. But consider that it took Bethesda somewhere between 1-7 years to update the engine from Fallout 3 > Fallout 4. \n\nCreating an entirely new one, training their staff on the new engine while they are already experienced in the old one, just doesn't seem likely. Not to mention the problems that would come about with mods. Bethesda games, at least on PC, are dead in the water without mod support. \n\nThis is really a 'be careful what you wish for' thing. Creation Engine sucks, but it's a necessary evil for what makes Bethesda games decent. 
What was wrong with the Deadpool character in that movie? 
I think the independent ending is canon because it's the only ending that can't be failed. 
Thank you for this post, it is thorough and informative.\n\nYou're right, all I'm looking for at the moment is a stocked gun for short-range defense of my home against hostile humans. Building a genuine fighting rifle will come some other day, and I have no reasonable expectation of encountering dangerous animals in my day to day life. If by some miracle I do, the Bersa .380 doublestack I'm looking to get for EDC will have to suffice.\n\nWould you say you're recommending the PS90 over a 9mm SBR'd PCC, then? And that you do consider 5.7 capable as a self-defense round?\n\nAs to sound mitigation, it was pointed out to me by others in the thread that while I can't use a suppressor, I *can* use electronic earmuffs, which would roughly even out to the same thing. Which would seem to be another point in favor of the PS90? Since one of the considerations in favor of a 9mm carbine was that it'd be marginally less loud.
On a related topic of note, it might interest folks to know that Bearcat armored trucks are not rated to withstand .50 BMG.
"Panzerkampfwagen" - armored fighting vehicle. Not "panther" fighting vehicle.
I would probably go for the RDB if my state didn't prevent me from suppressing it, but.... aren't there other guns that could get the job done without totally destroying my hearing? I really don't want to go any more deaf than I have to.
I got "Left SR." Sounds about right.
What's your country/budget?\n\nYou might be surprised at the decent-but-inexpensive options available.
Knowing myself I know that adrenaline hits me pretty hard. On top of anything else that's going on, as I am now I have to fight a tendency to tense up and freeze and my hands shake a lot. While I believe you that training mitigates such issues, I'd prefer a gun that requires a minimum of precise manipulation from me just to function between shots in a stressful scenario, particularly since I don't yet have anywhere near the degree of practice you discuss.
Lots of folks in the thread seem dubious about the effectiveness of 5.7mm in semi-auto vs the full auto the original weapon was designed around, and vs 5.56 that is apparently just as loud. \n\nWhat do you say in response to that? I agree the PS90 has fantastic maneuverability though.
What is your use case - plinking, hunting, or self-defense?\n\nIf I remember correctly Canadian law allows higher capacities for pistol magazines than the 5-round limit on rifles. There are carbines out there chambered in pistol calibers that use pistol magazines; I'm not 100% sure, but I think it may be the case that those carbines use the 10-round limit instead of the 5-round limit as well. If you're talking self-defense, that might be an option you haven't considered.\n\nWhen it comes to budget, the HiPoint 995TS is a dirt-cheap 9mm carbine that uses 10 round magazines and is supposed to be extremely reliable, albeit clunky and kind of ugly looking.\n\n.22LR beats big sticks and thrown rocks, but it is inadequate versus literally almost any other ammo option when it comes to guns. While there are .22LR guns with decent capacities, as you mention, .22 ammo is very weak and, more importantly, significantly less reliable than centerfire cartridges. The rimmed shape of the case can cause feeding issues in magazines, and rimfire primer is more likely to fail than centerfire primers. I wouldn't reccommend using a .22 for self defense unless your only alternative is fisticuffs.\n\nWhat .22 *is* excellent for is hunting small game and empty soda cans for dirt cheap.
I think it is a combination of the classist, racist segments of American culture with the material conditions of extreme inequality and disenfranchisement of the poor and minorities, exacerbated by counterproductive policies like the war on drugs and the boom of for-profit, punishment-over-rehabilitation prisons.
He is not. The more in-depth you look into NY and CA gun laws the more confused and horrified you will be.
Oh, come on. What criminal justice laws *don't* favor white people, either through wording or application, in the current American system?\n\nSYG doesn't favor white people through wording, so it becomes a question of application - which is a fault of our society, not the law itself.
Do you think there was magically a lack of violent crime prior to the invention of guns?\n\nA world without guns is a world where, at the street level, the strong and cruel totally dominate and victimize the weak, the gentle, and the infirm.\n\nWhat other tool do you propose to enable an elderly person, a woman or man of slight frame, or someone in a wheelchair to succesfully defend themselves on even terms with one or more heavily-built and aggressive men?\n\nThere have been instances where two black men with guns have held an entire lynch mob at bay. How well do you suppose they would have fared with just fisticuffs to rely on?\n\nI find your position both unrealistic and ableist.
I have a handgun in mind that I want to buy for everyday carry, but when I'm on my own turf and I don't need to worry about concealment, I want a stock and three points of contact.\n\nFrangible ammo is, from everything I've heard, a gimmick. It does not break up appreciably in drywall.
Now you're getting into the argument of "should," rather than the argument of "can."\n\nI find myself agreeing much more than disagreeing with you about "should," but the original question was "can," and one's position on "should" shouldn't affect an honest analysis of "can."
I think there's a fair argument to be made that the states were much more culturally unified at the time than Europe is, though.
I would argue that it's relevant because she represents two different minorities targetted by nazis and people like the KKK. Considering we engage in much of our "Punch nazis!" vs "Talk to nazis!" debate based on what we feel is an appropriate action to defend such people from outside aggression, it seems respectful to pay particularly close attention to their thoughts and feelings in the matter rather than just acting "for" them without them.
So basically, it's unicorn ammo designed to put money in FN's pockets at 900 rpm?
Nice try, ATF.\n\nBecause it's illegal as shit, and I don't want to get no-knock raided. On top of that, if I did get an illegal suppressor, the only circumstance I'd actually need it is the one that actively tells the world I've got one.\n\nFurthermore, other folks in this thread pointed out that I can just get noise-cancelling earmuffs to protect my ears, and actually enhance my hearing into the bargain.
Check the local law for your state thoroughly, I believe this is one of the aspects of gun ownership where the legality can vary wildly from place to place.
Having a group as blindly vitriolic and intellectually shoddy as /r/gunsarecool on your side is not a proud achievement.
sounds like some liberal machismo bullshit but ok
Thing about tasers is, *if* they work, they only work when they're A) in contact with the target and B) juice is flowing. As soon as the jolt stops, the disabling muscle contractions are gone soon after.\n\nWith pepper spray, you spray them once and if you do it right they stay sprayed for a good long time, allowing you to get away.
Some really typical cringy ignorance from the reporter in this one. He calls a mac-10 an "uzi" and an AR15 a "high-caliber rifle."
armored vehicles in general cringe at the thought of molotovs from what I understand, but the question I had in mind is one of effective range.\n\nMany armored vehicles have very effective drive-flat tires.
Do you have any idea how easy it is to make blackpowder and blackpowder weapons? Anyone with an amateur chemistry set, a mechanical workbench, and access to construction materials could build a crude gun.\n\nYou cannot simply un-invent a technology.
That is... really pitiful and sad. And it would explain a lot. :(
And takes a casual attitude towards violating women's bodily autonomy, can't forget that.
That is an excellent point, I will probably do that on top of whatever gun I end up getting.
Hi-point makes a pistol and a carbine that is offered in most of the common pistol calibers (9mm, .40, and .45). Of those, all perform about equally well with high-quality modern defense ammo, but in terms of practicing, 9mm ammo is the most common and thus the cheapest, and has the least recoil, making it the easiest to learn to handle.\n\nThese guns are extremely basic, clunky, and honestly kind of ugly, but they go bang when you need them to, the company that makes them offers great warranty coverage of the guns, and they're cheap. You will not win any long-range marksmanship contests with either of them, but at self-defense ranges they will get the job done.\n\nHipoint pistols (C9) are roughly $150, which is pretty much the least expensive option you can hope for to get a gun in an adequate self-defense caliber that isn't likely to blow up in your hand or fall apart after a couple hundred rounds. If you ever find yourself in better financial circumstances, you'll probably want to upgrade beyond a Hipoint pistol ASAP, but in the meantime it sure beats throwing rocks.\n\nTheir carbines (995TS) are $250 to $300, though you can sometimes get them for extra-cheap used, and are generally better-regarded than the pistols, from what I understand. This would be a solid choice as a home-defense firearm, as long guns with stocks are less difficult to shoot accurately than handguns, and the hipoint carbines have a reputation for just never quitting on you.\n\nIn the $275-300 range, the Bersa Thunder .380 is an excellent pistol known for giving great value on the cost. It is much higher quality than the hi-point, with better features, and much better ergonomics and concealability. The round is weaker than 9mm, but adequate for self-defense with the right ammo. It has a handful of variants, from a cut-down seven-shot concealed carry version to double-stacks that carry 15 rounds. I'm personally looking into one of the Bersa .380 doublestacks as my own carry gun.
Most likely! And none taken.\n\nAs I've said elsewhere, I tend to overthink everything, so while I'm at it I might as well gather all the data I can.
Wait, seriously?
>There's like ~150 people that I care about.\n\nThat's roughly a standard Monkeysphere, but it seems to me if we ever want to unfuck things on this planet we're going to have to actively try to surpass that particular hardware limitation.
It's big of you to acknowledge the misunderstanding, and I appreciate your candor. All too many people stick their fingers in their ears and shout "LA LA LA POL POT LA LA LA" when anyone tries to point out that antiauthoritarian leftism is a thing, because it doesn't fit their pet narrative of Demon Tyrant Commies Want To Steal Your Toothbrush.\n\nCo-ops by themselves are not necessarily socialist, but yes, they are definitely  a move closer to socialist principles than the current heavily hierarchical corporate business model.\n\nReddit's leftist subs have a tankie problem when it comes to moderators, because moderators are privileged positions of authority and tankies love authority. However the actual majority of day to day participants on those boards, in my experience, lean heavily anti-authoritarian. And yes, the power of voluntary participation and association are big in antiauthoritarian leftist thought.
Is it the obligation of an oppressed person to be nice, or to be free?
on /k/ they have whole threads about literal gun lust. Up to and including people fapping on their guns and using .50 BMG rounds as buttplugs.\n\nIt may be reactionary, but it's a magical place.
A lot of those shitstains you mentioned don't debate in good faith, but more power to you trying to reach people with reason. I don't say we shouldn't try to do that. I just say that shame many not always be an effective tool and that I don't think punching prominent neonazis should be off the table for comrades.
ew
May I ask what about them scares you? Hollywood and media do a lot to portray them as scary, and there's certain parts of the country where people are used to thinking of guns as something that only criminals and police use, but at the end of the day they're just tools. Once you get some experience with them and demistify them a bit they tend to stop being so scary.\n\nNow, obviously it's not my place and I have no interest in telling you that you *must* love guns or own and train with guns. But they have no moral value or intent of their own, not any more than a chainsaw or a hammer does, and in the right set of circumstances they can be extremely valuable for protecting yourself and the people you care about from harm.
I'm not worried about a PCC having enough oomph to take out a bad guy, but I do worry about overpenetration. A CX4 is one of the options I've considered though.\n\nIn the other thread someone was saying that 9mm out of most pistols is just as loud as 5.56; would a carbine length barrel really quiet it down that much?
[Remove Panzer.](https://collection.nam.ac.uk/images/960/109000-109999/109235.jpg)
Practical reasons I like the bersa:\n\n* Reputation for being very reliable and not picky about ammo\n* Consistently praised as having fantastic value for cost, which after the splurge a PS90 represents kind of jumps  out at me\n* Supposedly has a really solid SA/DA trigger, and SA/DA appeals to me.\n* 15+1 capacity in a very modestly sized and reportedly low-recoil gun\n* Service-proven; apparently a handful of south american police forces and militaries use them, and they're popular carry guns in countries that limit civilians to .380.\n\nLess practical reasons I like the bersa:\n\n* I'm in love with the aesthetics. It's a sleek all-metal James Bond gun for half the price and double the capacity of an actual PPK.\n* Fixed barrel design - although I recognize that I am and will likely continue to be a larger detriment to the gun's accuracy than whether the barrel tilts, this appeals to me.
This is the best demonstration I have yet seen for why we need Victoria 3.\n\nThird-generation games are great fun, until they make you want to tear your eyes out.
By all means, get geeky on me, hombre. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nNo seriously, I'm prone to overthinking everything, so while I'm at it I might as well have all the info I can get. I'd value your input.
I'm also scratching my head that the chart claims an M2HB only produces 158dB for the gunner when I've read elsewhere that .50 BMG cranks out 170-180dB.
Peculiar choice for antipersonnel use. [Barrets are not really precision rifles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEDFn3UtVIc) and most .50 ammo is far from match grade, since its primary use is as a HMG round. But the article did say they used them at relatively close ranges, I guess.\n\nFor combining high precision with extreme range and power for antipersonnel use, I think the standard is more along the lines of rifles in .338 Lapua Magnum.\n\n
If I got earmuffs they'd be the quality electronic ear protector kind, so that I wasn't totally cut off from my sense of hearing, yeah.\n\nThanks for the feedback!
I'm aware, but I'm talking about the difference between "more deaf than before" and "completely or nearly-completely deaf."\n\nI can live with my hearing being somewhat worse after defending myself. I'd rather not lose the majority of it altogether, though, and I've been told that firing high-pressure rifle rounds indoors with no protection will do that to you.
Abrams, not garand.
Sweet, thank you.
And the EU is the European *Union.* What I mean is, there was a strong element of shared identity amongst the different colonies as well as shared economic interests; with the EU, you mostly just have economic interest. You'd never hear a Frenchman identifying as a "European" first.
Damn. That's disheartening, but extremely useful info. Thank you for sharing it with me.\n\nDoes that mean a subsonic 9mm PCC is my best bet, then? Or do I run into an issue of subsonic 9mm being underpowered?
Mass murder is horrible but statistically a drop in the bucket compared to total gun homicides.\n\nMass shooters seem to tend to be young disaffected men warped by some form of extreme alienation and sense of isolation, though.
So fuck everyone else, you got yours, right?
>what's weird to me is that tankies are exactly the same way\n\nNot to mention stuff like the Assad apologism.
Not to mention all the poor doggos that would have gotten shot.
I'm not going sit here to pretend there wouldn't be serious obstacles and challenges to a leftist revolution, but to act as if it's utterly hopeless as so many in this thread are doing seems equally out of touch with reality.\n\nShould armed revolution be the left's strategy at this point? Fuck no. Becoming armed for self-defense while we do our absolute best to bring about nonviolent progress is clearly the best way forward, and being armed for self-defense is not the same thing as launching a revolution.
Still a lot better than 157+ dB.
Look into a pistol caliber carbine, then. It strikes the best balance of capacity, effectiveness on target, and cost for your situation, and since it 'only' shoots pistol rounds it's less likely to be looked at as a "scary high-powered babykiller gun."\n\nYour other alternative is a genuinely high-powered hunting rifle, which has the standoff range and stopping power to mitigate the drawback of a 5 round limit, and which will happily serve you as a long ranged marksman's rifle in a SHTF scenario.
I do not recall any instances where Hillary supporters have shot or killed people, particularly not over their ethnicity or religion. I am afraid we clearly cannot say the same for Trump's admirers.\n\nPersonally I am a socialist who hated both candidates, and, considering how Hillary lost and is now a political irrelevancy, I do not see the validity of bringing her up when discussing racially or religiously motivated violence in the US.\n\nYou have also failed to answer my original question - why do you think so many hateful groups and people feel specifically encouraged and empowered by Trump, to the point that some of them have specifically said they feel his election gives them the go-ahead to act on their hateful beliefs?
The gun I keep coming back to look at in my search for a carry pistol is a doublestack Bersa Thunder .380, so I wouldn't have a common ammo type between that and a 9mm carbine. Your point about earpro is well taken, though.
Because liberals tend to be statists, whereas most leftists seem to recognize the violence of the state.
>Firing any rifle cartridges in your apparent will hurt your hearing.\n\nWhich is why I am asking about a gun that fires a PDW round, or possibly a pistol-caliber carbine if folks think the PS90 doesn't make sense.\n\n>Why is magazine size such an issue your you, do you think you will need 30+ rounds when defending your home.\n\nCapacity is good. So long as I'm not weighing a gun down with something stupid and bulky like a beta-C mag, better to be completely confident I have more shots than I need than to chance needing more shots than I have, right?\n\nI'm not married to ultra-high-capacity but I certainly see it as a plus.
After which the article says he quit drinking, according to his friends.
DEBOUT, LES DAMNÉS DE LA TERRE
>You do realize that if we just mock people that hold racist ideas, they will eventually become ashamed of those beliefs and abandon them over time, right?\n\nThis is an oversimplistic view. If they have enough of a circle of fellow thinkers around them they will simply close ranks and double down in response to such an attack from the "other." And thanks to the internet bringing people with niche interests together, these days there are always fellow thinkers within easy contact.\n\nWith regards to more 'moderate' folks that you're hoping to peer pressure into acting better- I'm afraid your shame tactic will simply play into their stereotypes of the Left as harpies who want to drive white men to self-hatred. You forget that a large part of the current alt-right movement are people who already feel like self-hating, ostracized losers and gravitate to these ideologies as a way to feel like they aren't. I'm not arguing that such people need to be coddled, but it is facile to assume that when shame has already failed or been outright counterproductive, more shame will somehow miraculously work.\n\n>Anyone who actually considers themselves a Nazi in 2017 is a loser who needs to be laughed at, not punched.\n\nI guarantee you Spencer thinks of himself as a nazi behind closed doors when he doesn't have a PR facade to keep up. We seemed to do alright punching him.
You aren't really coming out o that exchange looking like the vindicated party here, OP.
Which is hilarious because apparently the police have no actual obligation to help anyone, according to the courts.
Yes, there are more gun deaths per year than just rifle deaths, but most of them are handgun deaths. This chart isn't trying to minimize gun deaths, it's pointing out that the guns that are constantly under attack for Looking Scary are actually a tiny fraction of both gun crime and overall murder, rather than the epidemic they're portrayed as.
What Daryl Davis has done is heroic and was accomplished extremely slowly over the course of many years.\n\nIt is right to applaud what he has done, but it is wrong to demand that every person of color be expected to sacrifice the same amount of time and effort reaching out to the hateful, at significant risk to their own personal safety. It must also be understood that even for those willing to put in such herculean work, even so there are still people who will not be reached.
While I agree with the general thrust of the article, there's some points that really make me raise my eyebrows and scratch my head - as someone who knows a modest amount about guns, certain phrases used and points made indicate to me that the author of this article was fairly ignorant about certain aspects of firearms and how they work.\n\nIt is not enough to merely arm ourselves. To own a weapon is to have a pressing need to be *extremely* informed about all aspects of such weapons' function and use, so that they can be employed responsibly.\n\nIf you wish to pick up the gun, train how to understand its technology and history *at least* as hard as you would train yourself in studying your favorite particular field of left/anarchist theory. \n\nComrades with guns but only a slapdash idea of how to properly and safely use them do us all more harm than good.
With respect, then, why is it that so many hateful groups feel so specifically encouraged and empowered by his presidency?
No one here is saying "Don't strike, don't organize, don't walkout" (except maybe leftcoms).\n\nWhat many of us are saying is that it is myopic and unrealistic to limit our options *solely* to those things and not also take a pragmatic look at the value of armed self-defense.
When it gets to hunting rifles I'm more out of my depth, so I'm not sure. You might ask /r/firearms for some pointers there, they don't share our politics but they still have a wealth of knowledge to mine.
Thanks for the info. Based on what I've learned since posting this, apparently 5.7 isn't really any quieter than 5.56 indoors; so I'm starting to think maybe I'd be better off with a keltec RDB + linear compensator.
Excellent advice, thank you. I will do that.
>"Political power flows from the barrel of a gun."\n\n-Some Chinese Guy.
Governments can go bad. Our country was founded in a rebellion against a government that *did* go bad for the colonists. So when they were drafting up the law of the land, they formally recognized the possibility of governments turning on their citizens and the right of citizens to resist such governments.\n\nDistrust of government has been an enduring streak in American culture, especially American gun culture, ever since.\n\nThen on top of that you have all sorts of evidence pointing to the fact that america is now de facto an oligarchy run by hyper-rich billionaires, big business interests, and elite political insiders while the rest of us go unheard and suffer under stagnant wages and chronic underemployment, and it's not surprising that people don't feel too much kinship with the government.
I would wager that it's because of decades o Cold War era propaganda and oppression of the true left rendering us a political nonentity in the minds of most Americans; thus, their only context for "left" is democrats and liberals, and anything further left is seen as basically just half-real boogeymen of a bygone era.

Thank you! Maybe I will go with a 9mm carbine after all, then. Lots to think about.
Standing Rock was a tactical loss, but I wonder if it may be a strategic victory considering how much it's done to spread awareness and anti-state, anti-capitalist sentiment. The pacifism failed to stop the corporate jackboots but it did help win over the sympathy of a lot of liberals who might have kneejerked against the protestors if they'd been armed... and then the camp provided an instructive, months long lesson in the dangers of state monopoly on force, helping to radicalize a lot of those liberals. It helped radicalize me, in fact.\n\nI understand that's probably cold and hollow comfort to you as someone who's part of the native community, though. :(
Yeah, more or less. If you're familiar with the two-axis political compass, anarchocommunism is more or less the furthest bottom-left corner, while libertarian socialism is a less "extreme" point along the same diagonal line from center. I think ancoms have a good "ideal goal," I just find it far more plausible that we'd end up with a minimal state than no state.
No, I'm in my mid twenties. I just want something with a stock for the extra points of contact and stability when aiming, and a shorter long gun can have a smaller "wingspan" in a shooting position than a handgun held out in front of you. Particularly something as compact as a PS90.\n\nI intend to become as good of a shot with a pistol as I can, but since it's an inherently less stable platform than something with a stock, why not stack the odds in my favor?
Me, sorry, I assumed they were providing helpful advice about 9mm subsonic ammo. :S
Most likely, but since my state outlawed suppressors, what muzzle device do you recommend?
something tells me there's motivated reasoning at work here.
Weird. It sounds like they're hesitating a foot in front of the finish line, then; the question is, why?
Huh, never knew that was the reason. I'd always assumed the founders just thought a foreign-born citizen might be a plant or otherwise Not American Enough.
Therein lies the beginning of wisdom, OP.
[You're asking the wrong question.](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2012/08/robert-farago/self-defense-tip-dont-shoot-less-lethal-rounds/) Rubber bullets are lethal at the kind of ranges you'd be shooting in a self-defense scenario, and you're in a world of trouble if you engage someone outside of typical self-defense ranges.\n\nThere's only two scenarios for a shoot using rubber bullets at the engagement ranges where they begin to be considered less-lethal. Either you've attacked someone from range while rule of law is still in force, and you are absolutely 200% fucked legally, or civilization is coming apart at the seams and you're using ineffective rounds that do a poor job of putting down determined or armored attackers while in the midst of what is essentially a warzone.
Progress requires people willing to do stuff other than sit in a chair and gripe, so judging by the leftcoms I've seen on reddit I'd say no.
You see this sort of attitude so much, it's not even funny. To a zealot, your opponents need to be be made out as scary and inhuman and overwhelming so that you can feel vindicated in whatever you do to oppose them, yet also subhuman and pathetic and less-than so you can feel superior to them and confident of your eventual victory. The same sort of classic "Too strong, but also too weak" you see in anti-semitic/white supremacist retoric.\n\nIt's probably one of the oldest pieces of tribal doublethink out there.
Hipoint designs their firearms with an eye towards being low-cost enough that even the most budget-minded will be able to afford them. This neccesarily demands that they make a number of tradeoffs in their design process, but compared to other "cheap gun" manufacturers hi-point generally makes more durable and reliable designs for the price.\n\nThey're totally graceless and lack any pretense of polish or refinement, but they work, and while the company's QA process won't be perfect (lemons happen, moreso with the pistols than the carbines) it will be much better than their competition in that price bracket. More than that, even if your gun does break, their warranty and customer service in repairing it or getting you a new one is supposed to be quite good.\n\nA lot of people shit talk them out of what basically amounts to snobbery. Yes, they are flatly inferior to the vast majority of commonly-used self defense handguns, but they're not designed to compete with such guns, they're designed to get the job done on a shoestring.
It pains me to once again see Sikhs suffer as the collateral damage of other people's blind, indiscriminate, unjustified hatred.\n\nSympathy and solidarity from an American agnostic.
Supposedly the RDB is the exception to KelTec's usual reputation. Ian McCollum of Forgotten Weapons rates it extremely highly, and I'm hard pressed to think of someone I'd consider a better judge of firearms. :V
While that's encouraging, the armed forces has been known to bend the truth about how much hearing loss their people are suffering. An article I read about sound exposure to jet engines for aircraft carrier deck crews comes to mind.
The number of gun owning americans is vastly greater than the number of police and military personnel, and other countries such as Russia have openly stated before that they would offer material support to a popular uprising against the US government. Any revolution that might occur wouldn't happen in a vacuum - other nations would be eager to try and jockey for position against the US' global superpower status.
Thanks for the recommendations. Based on everything I'm learning in this thread I might end up going for the RDB with one of your reccommended muzzle devices after all.
Dude, if you don't know anything about socialism, why do you insist on commenting in threads like this? This is a serious question.\n\nNobody mentioned anything about Ron Paul or US policy at all.
Oh, okay.\n\nI am not seeing those things, just so you know.
[Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are sequences which are - and I know no math at all, so please correct me if I'm wrong - constructed by determining the probability of a certain value following another.

You're the best, comrade.
The OP has literally no ideas.
[There's a nice little contemporary comic on this phenomenon](http://i.imgur.com/7EMPkRi.jpg), which probably doesn't need translation.
When did you hear of them? I might be very outdated here.\n\nAlso, are you still in Philly? How are you organizing nowadays?
I got it as Muisca.
It's not just a dichotomy, "private" vs. "public". Even in the most authoritarian Marxist-Leninist states, post-'30 USSR included, public property is *in theory* just a transition phase to communism, in which property don't exist at all (whether Stalinist states actually thought their policies would lead to that conclusion is a different matter). All communist states claim to aspire to a stateless society.\n\nThat's exactly the difference between the Nazis as "Socialist" and Stalinists as "Communists" that the OP needs to know. To the Nazis, a mixed public-private economy like Lenin's NEP was the economic end, whereas to Communists it was only ever supposed to be a means. Stalin actually bit the bullet and made all property "public", but in fact it was state capitalist anyway.\n\nNow, I'm a Trotskyist and we're infamous for dense, pointless historical analysis, so the above view lacks a lot of nuance in the field, but to keep it relatively simple and informative you need to introduce that distinction.
I like that I can get the little psychological hit of ordering it *now*, but at the same time know that I'm not incentivizing an unfinished product.
>Mao anything\n\nI'd rather not. Or is punctuation bourgeois now?
Ooh, I'm an anthropology undergrad and this is really interesting to me: would it be unethical to remotely record the speech of North Sentinelese and work from there?
You can't read them - like, you just don't have the time, or you can't actually see them?
PSL and WWP are cultish, SAlt is pretty okay. They're reform-ish (I'm not really sure, they have a weird line) but I've been to them in Philly and they're decent. Philly Socialists is... I didn't have a great experience, but they've been doing good work, so I shouldn't say anything against them.
In theory, "National Socialism" meant "socialist (not Marxist) principles applied to a nation, rather than internationally". Fascist movements in the 20th Century developed not necessarily out of, but alongside leftist movements. For example, the first Fascist manifesto in Italy had some rather progressive goals in labor rights and wanted to redistribute wealth generally. However, they were emphatically *not* Marxists or communists - they rejected both historical materialism (the foundation of the Marxist left) and proletarian internationalism, in favor of "racial science" and nationalism. Nonetheless, they professed to stand for worker's rights, hence the "Socialism".\n\nIn reality, however, this was never more than a neat trick to get workers on their side. Hitler liquidated the left of his party (led by the Strasser brothers) and privatized a great deal of German industry, as well as reining in trade unions.
Congrats, you invented neoliberalism.
That sort of "left-centre-right" analysis is horribly inaccurate. You're ignoring the existence of anarchism, for example - which is a form of communism - the fact that communism implies the eventual end of the state, the Leninist, Market Socialist and Left Communist definitions of socialism (basically, anyone who thinks that socialism =/= government intervention) and the difference between communist politics and communist theory. It's basically the worst possible understanding of the distinction.
"Correct grammar" is what everyone (without a disability) speaks. You're making a distinction of register, which is fine, and universalizing it, which is not.
If you are seeing those things in the photograph you may wish to inform a doctor.

Quick and funny quote by Benjamin Franklin:\n\n>Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely   white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is   black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new   Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians,   French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call   a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only   excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People   on the Face of the Earth. 
Great playthough indeed. You'll want to annex Venezuela off the bat for the oil, then try to start a non-aligned faction with Portugal and grab Danzig. *Make sure* South Africa is independent and Fascist; if they've taken the Communist focus tree, restart. If that works, you're in a great position to liberate Egypt, and then you're golden.
Nazi Germany privatized the largest state firm in the world at the time (German Rail) and liquidated people who advocated for what you're talking about (Strasser). The "socialism" was a half-hearted front to get workers on their side.
Just <<KIDDING>>. You will <<DIE TOO SOON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH MUCH OF NOTE>>.
Note that I was with them last year, while Trump was still a meme, so I don't really know what they're like recently. I just found them quite bureaucratic, with a frustrating predominance of Maoist stuff. They've got a real leadership problem, in that Tim runs the whole thing - and to be fair to him he does a great job - but I haven't heard anyone who knows what's going to happen when/if he moves on.\n\nPersonally, I liked SAlt in Philly more, although I haven't heard much from them recently. I'm not much of a protestor - I'll go, but I don't feel like I'm getting much done - so it's been a weird past few months for me in the Philly left.

>Fast forward 2.6 million years, and we find representations of the female libido in society as forced or elicited feedback to primal male sexual aggression.\n\nBe very, very wary of universalized statements like this, especially as concerns one half of the entire human population's interaction with the other. Take, for example, the *Lysistrata*:\n\n>LYSISTRATA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t All\tright\tthen—\n\t\t\t\t\t we\thave\tto\tgive\tup\tall\tmale\tpenises.\n\n>*The\twomen\treact\twith\tgeneral\tconsternation*\n\n>Why\tdo\tyou\tturn\taway?

There’s nothing like it, dear Lysistrata.\n\n>LYSISTRATA: And what about you?\n\n>MYRRHINE:  I’d choose the fire, too.\n\n\n>LYSISTRATA: What a debased race we women are! It’s no wonder men write tragedies about us. We’re good for nothing but screwing Poseidon in the bathtub.\t\n\nTo ancient Greeks, the object of marriage (aside from childbearing) was often to *restrain* female sexuality, rather than to provide a permanent object for male desire. This ties in with the stereotype of men as more coolly rational and women more given to "passions", extremely prevalent in Mediterranean antiquity. \n\nFinally, as the poster above notes, writing didn't exist until about 3000 BC, and originally dealt with economic or bureaucratic concerns. Personal and social writing began even later. As for drawings and sculpture, they're basically impossible to interpret objectively - for any Paleolithic sculpture or carving you find, you can find modern cultures that produce similar artifacts but have wildly differing views of gender and sexuality.

Anthro major with a focus in Native American cultures here: it's pronounced very much as it's written, "kwa-kwa-ka'-wakw". The <a> is pronounced as in "father"; the <'> is pronounced either as a glottal stop (the catch in breath you make when you say, for example, "uh-oh") or glottalizes the /w/ (like a grumble, but only for that consonant). The <kw> is pronounced by rounding your lips when you expel the air from the /k/, so it sounds like a little whispered "oo".\n\nNormally when you're talking about them in English you'd pronounce it like "qua-qua-ka-wak". No need to overdo it.
Yeah, the IWW has some presence here - I know a couple guys, but I suppose a couple guys is all anyone knows. To me, SAlt really got into their groove when Trump was elected - quick, reasonable response, and good outreach. They don't push the more Trotty aspects at all, which even I can get embarrassed about. Unfortunately, I haven't heard anything much from them recently, which is a shame as they were getting 20+ at every meeting.

What does pro Putin mean?
It means they don't follow NATO's geopolitical line on Ukraine

They're very vocally in support of Russia when it comes to international affairs. For example, they support the Russian takeover of Crimea.
Can you substantiate this claim? It's one thing to be against NATO and Western imperialism and thereby favorable to forces that offer something of a counterweight to it, and another to actually support the political line of Putin and the United Russia Party (which I am pretty sure they do not). The distinction is important as we should speak and characterize with due consideration to specifics, otherwise we get caught up in sensationalism and sweeping, incorrect generalizations without critical appraisal of both our thoughts and actions. 
Not bowing to NATO and US interests, most often than not.

Just how pro-Russia is the KKE compared to other Greek political parties? Greece as a whole is pretty friendly towards Russia with the whole Byzantine-Tsarist cultural and historical connections, so I'm not sure the KKE is special in that regard.
It's really neat how the Soviets were able to steal all that space technology from the West before we'd even invented it. Just goes to show how dastardly those Communists really are...
Not inherently moreso than most, really. They're certainly more careful about their friendliness to Russia than, say, New Democracy is.
I'm mostly basing this on reports from a friend in Thessaloniki. He often sends me links to greekreporter articles in which KKE representatives have demonstrated uncomfortable closeness to Putin's geopolitical goals, so I'll see if I can find them to link back here.
Not that I know of.
I have seen no evidence of that. The only statement about Crimea on their website completely contradicts what you have said. http://inter.kke.gr/en/articles/Statement-of-Press-Office-of-the-CC-of-the-KKE-on-the-Ukraine-and-the-referendum-in-the-Crimea/
It should be noted for the future that we should be wary of supporting the KKE. They may be "communist," but they're also pro-Putin and strictly against gay rights.
does your friend happen to be this one oakke guy?
Yeah, this exactly. I'm Jewish, but Israel does not represent me or my interests. I despise that the West has allowed them to get away with so much and turn the Jewish identity into a settler-colonialist one, especially considering that, prior to the creation of Israel, [Eastern European Jews were one of the most radical ethnic minorities in the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia#Jews_in_the_revolutionary_movement) (hence why so many revolutionary leaders during that time were Jewish). It's really sad to me that Israel has been able to completely erase our revolutionary heritage like that...

Not sure if you got the memo, but the U.S.-backed rebels in Eastern Aleppo and elsewhere haven't been on the side of the people or the democratic revolution in Syria for a *long time*. Now the FSA consists largely of Al-Qaeda and their fronts. The SDF, the only faction actually worth supporting in Syria, is (a) not present in Aleppo to any significant degree, and (b) at the present moment cooperating with the regime. \n\nIt was the rebels who were massacring civilians trying to escape Eastern Aleppo, who took civilians and soldiers hostage and executed them before accepting the government's offer to be transported to Idlib, and poisoned the reservoirs that deliver water to Damascus, a city of more than one million. Now, that doesn't mean that we should necessarily support the regime (as lesser-evilism is bankrupt anyway), but it does mean that supporting the FSA and other Syrian rebels as you seem to be pits you *against* the Syrian people and their best interests.
¿Por qué no los dos, compañero?
Put simply, Marx's analysis doesn't really care all that much about *who* is in charge of any individual company. What mattered to him was capitalism's *anarchy in production* (i.e. the lack of any unifying or goal-oriented mechanism for guiding production to socially-beneficial ends), and it's from this characteristic, and not that of the lack of democracy within the production chain of individual companies, that he extrapolates his most damning critiques of capitalism.
I tend to point out that if we lived in the early 1800s, we would not have a good example of *successful* democracy to point to (our only experiences being the English and French Revolutions, both of which eventually failed), but that obviously doesn't mean that democracy can never succeed. So, just because we had one or two implementations of communism that didn't work out, doesn't mean that it's impossible to learn from the mistakes of the past and implement it better next time around.\n\nIn my experience, this tends to get people to think twice about that point if they were actually open to being convinced in the first place.
Only really in countries where the communists couldn't take over tho
Especially after what I saw here in NY during the election, I really doubt current liberals will be the backbone of a future revolutionary movement. The people who will be most receptive to and enthusiastic about communism are members of the working class, especially proletarians of color, in the South and Midwest, who don't identify strongly with either party (having gone from Democratic in the '70s to Republican with Reagan then back to Democratic in the '90s and '00s and then to Republican again with Trump...) — i.e. people whose class interests align most directly with communism — not Northeastern upper-income Clintonite liberals, who seem agreeable on the outside but whose progressivism only acts as a veneer for the staunchly neoliberal and pro-imperialist politics which are in *their own* class interests.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that liberals I'm familiar with can't be drawn over to the communist cause, but I think it would be many times easier and more fruitful to agitate amongst working-class people in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Virginia, and so on. And even if we have to explicitly badmouth the "elitist liberals" and lay bare the bankruptcy of the Democrats' ideology to win these people to our side, I think it will help us much, much more than it will hurt us.
The German leadership weren't the only ones committing massive atrocities during WW2. Rank-and-file German soldiers also killed millions of Jewish and Slavic Soviet citizens to accelerate the process of getting their *lebensraum*, completely depopulating many small cities in the process. In fact, iirc about 1/3 of the Jews killed in the Holocaust were not killed in concentration camps but by Germans eager hasten the colonization Russia by killing off *untermenschen*.\n\nNo sympathy for Nazi soldiers.

I'd start with Marx. Though Smith and Ricardo made very valuable contributions to the study of economics, their theories possessed many flaws, which Marx fixed. The one caveat is that Marx can be very dense and confusing sometimes, so you'll want to be careful that you're actually understanding what you're reading. I'd refer you to most of the same things I mentioned in my other comment: start with the Law of Value video series, move on to more simple Marxist economic texts, and then finally attempt Capital with Harvey's lectures in accompaniment.
I wonder if they'd defend the practice of sharecropping in the postbellum South in the same way.\n\n"It's just a coincidence that those former slaves are working for their former owners in return for practically nothing; it was their *voluntary choice*!"
I like how the article first claims that kulaks didn't exist and then turns right around and says that the Bolsheviks were Nazistic in that they demonized people (like liberals aren't doing that right now as a part of their 3-month running freakout about Slay Kween losing to Il Cheeto Benito). Liberals' mental gymnastics would be impressive were they not so frustrating.
I'm always surprised at how quickly people seem to be making that transformation these days. It took me 2-3 years, beginning to notice the subtle and not-so-subtle ways of reinforcing ideology around me, the experience of SYRIZA, and a crapton of reading to get me to go from socdem to Leninist. So it's super interesting to me that for some it just took Bernie's campaign and Trump's election...

No, the workers themselves are forced to do it by market pressures. Remember, exploitation doesn't happen under capitalism because capitalists are mean and greedy, it happens because the companies that don't drive profit margins up and wages down get wiped out by their competition.

According to the article, Marcy supported all socialist governments despite not agreeing with their actions because of his theory of "global class war," but since Marcy's time many changes have occurred within China, Vietnam, North Korea, etc. that have drastically changed the class nature of all of those states. What is the PSL's line on the modern East Asian states still governed by Communist parties?
Capitalist economists like to tout around something called the "the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics," which states that, if there is perfect information, perfect competition, and no significant externalities, markets will lead to a "Pareto-efficient" distribution of resources. There are several problems with this, however: we do not have perfect information or perfect competition in the market, and market externalities are in fact very very large (especially in energy production). This leads to instances of us overproducing gasoline by 25%, natural gas by 42%, and coal by 70% [*('The Hidden Costs of Energy,' National Research Council, 2010)*](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12794/hidden-costs-of-energy-unpriced-consequences-of-energy-production-and). In fact, the conditions required for the economists' "invisible hand" to actually produce the best outcome for everyone are so restrictive that they essentially have never happened and could never happen in the real world [*('Market Power and Transferrable Property Rights,' Robert W. Hahn, 1984)*](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/pub/faculty/garvie/eer/hahn.pdf).\n\nThere are also many similar arguments that aren't strictly about efficiency. Even if we had perfect competition, perfect information, and no externalities, there's still no guarantee of socially desirable outcomes. Since markets only respond to effective demand, markets are inevitably plagued with a chronic inability to hear the demands of the poor; hence why, in the United States, the richest country in the world, [there are 5 times as many peopleless homes as homeless people](http://blog.amnestyusa.org/us/housing-its-a-wonderful-right/), there are [150 million people in poverty or near poverty](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011%E2%80%9012%E2%80%9015/poor%E2%80%90census%E2%80%90low%E2%80%90income/51944034/1), [20% of the population is 'food insecure' (i.e. hungry) despite us producing enough food within our own borders for 500 million people](http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/hunger-and-poverty-fact-sheet.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/), and a [whole host of other depressingly embarrasing statistics](https://kairoscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Poverty-Fact-Sheet-Feb-2015-final.pdf).\n\nMarkets are, unsurprisingly, also not very good at "lifting people out of poverty," as the U.N. and other capitalist organizations claim. [In the United States, the poverty rate has not been decreasing since the 1960s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/07/11/poverty-in-the-50-years-since-the-other-america-in-five-charts/?utm_term=.9afefe244872), and globally, the [percentage of people outside of China living in poverty is actually increasing (the U.N.'s constant parading of their lowering of the poverty rate worldwide is actually just a combination of the modernization of China and a lowering of the poverty threshold)](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/exposing-great-poverty-reductio-201481211590729809.html). This will no doubt increase the number of yearly deaths that capitalism can reasonably be blamed for, which is currently sitting at an astounding [18 million per annum (which lays bare the hypocrisy that underlies all the moral outrage capitalists and their adulatories express about however million people they claim were killed thanks to the Platonic ideal of Communism)](http://heartsandminds.org/poverty/hungerfacts.htm). Not only are things suckier than most people know in the Global South, but social mobility in the West is also greatly overestimated: in America, [only about 6% of people in the bottom income quintile (<21K per year) ever make it to the uppermost quintile (>100K per year), a fact which casts serious doubt on the efficacy of bourgeois economists' claims that "anybody with a good idea can start a business and get rich!"](https://www.brookings.edu/research/economic-mobility-of-families-across-generations/), and [even in Sweden, left-liberals' favorite example of functional capitalism, social mobility is depressingly absent](http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Sweden%202012%20AUG.pdf). All in all (even leaving out the monster that is capitalism's regular economic crises), these data do not lead to nearly as good a prognosis for capitalism as anyone might initially think.\n\nThat, of course, raises the question of alternative systems. Though the model of Soviet planning was in many ways flawed—lack of free flow of productive information, planning off of estimates on total products needed and not off of how many needed for civilian consumption specifically, clinging to their traditional means of calculating plan targets ("material balances") and not embracing modernization and computerization, etc.— it still has certain merits over capitalist economies, such as being to industrialize significantly more quickly [*('Socialist and non-socialist industrialization patterns, a comparative appraisal,' Paul Gregory, 1970)*](http://econpapers.repec.org/article/prsrtiers/tiers_5f0040-7356_5f1971_5fnum_5f12_5f48_5f1827_5ft1_5f0856_5f0000_5f2.htm) and [being much easier to make environmentally sustainable](http://pages.vassar.edu/sustainability/video/history-of-sustainability-in-cuba/), since continual economic growth is not necessary. The stereotypical Eastern European "food shortages," it's also worth noting, were not a chronic problem in all socialist states: they were much more common in Poland and the USSR (the former of which had privatized their agriculture in 1956) than in, say, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia (which both had nationalized and planned agriculture). That said, the Soviet planning model did have certain chronic deficiencies, and better planning models could certainly be made: there have been many different ones proposed and whole books written about them, but I'd say the most well-known and promising ones are the [Cockshott&Cottrell model](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/new_socialism.pdf), [the Lange model](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830772?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), and [Albert's ParEcon](http://www.contra-versus.net/uploads/6/7/3/6/6736569/albert_michael_life_after_capitalism_2003.pdf). These all make some attempt to combine all the benefits of central planning (not producing for a profit allowing us to service social needs directly, ending economic exploitation of the working class, environmental sustainability, etc.) while getting rid of the problems that were extant in the models of the 20th century.\n\nUltimately, between the automation of labor and the environmental crisis, our future is in economic planning. We can't keep with a system that requires indefinite growth so long as we live on a finite planet (which, for the foreseeable future, we will), nor can we just sit around while mechanization makes larger and larger swaths of the population unemployed while bosses get richer and richer. Only planned economics can create a system where the antagonism between the enrichment of humanity and the deprivation of the natural world can be resolved and technology can be used to reduce the amount of time that everyone has to work instead of the reducing the number of people who can work. Planned economies would put us in control of our own destiny as a species, and are perfectly workable with modern technology. At this point in our species' development, they are practically a necessity if we wish to keep pressing forward.
Yes, abolishing private property while retaining markets does not represent a meaningful break from capitalism, just as abolishing markets while retaining private property doesn't either. Whatever, you call it, mutualism or market socialism or Wolff's WSDEs, capitalism is capitalism is capitalism.
> If you follow the official statements of the different institutions here, the main party PYD, TEV-DEM, the women’s movement, then you can see that everybody in Rojava clearly understands the interests of America in Syria. We all know what he US wants and what it doesn’t want, and their responsibility for groups like ISIS and Al-Nusra. It is more than they destroyed Iraq and so forth, they took a role in directly creating them, then they lost control of them, and now they have to fix the problem they created. So naturally they want our help. Our relationship to them is again open and official, not a secret – it is tactical, not strategic. They want to use us and we try to get the best out of it. We have to, we have lot of enemies and we have to defend ourselves. It is a practical and political necessity to find our place in the balance of so many big players around us, because everyone has interests in Syria, so we try to defend the interests of the people. And that’s not possible when you just say ‘No, no, no!’ and start conflicts with all enemies at once.\n\n> Their main regional allies are of course Turkey, Barzani’s Peshmerga forces, and still parts of the FSA who they are training with the British Army in Lebanon. Turkey is attacking Kurds here, in Bakur and clearly aiding ISIS, and the Peshmerga are badly trained and motivated, whilst the YPG has been the most effective force against ISIS on the ground, so America has to be seen to be helping us as well. In fact we forced them, though building up a strong military position, to cooperate with us. That gives us the possibility to make the position of this revolution stronger and that’s something that we need. Revolution is nothing that you can defend by talking about it, you have to give something to the people, you have to protect them, you have to give food to them, you have to give infrastructure to them, and if you are isolating yourself completely from everyone else, you can’t do that.\n\n> America would like to have us as a main ally, but they know that is not possible; militarily we are cooperating at times, but ideologically we are enemies. America is the avant-garde force of the capitalist system, and we are the avant-garde force of the alternative. Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but one day in the future this will come to a head.\n\n\\- YPG Commander Cihan Kendal

It may not help the socialist movement to have "arbitrary purity tests," but it *certainly* doesn't help to uphold the legacy of a man who's bombing seven different countries, has imprisoned numerous political dissidents, vastly expanded the scope drone program, has been a consistent ally of the ruling class against the workers (himself, a multimillionaire, being a part of that class), etc. etc. \n\nI get the feeling that Trump will by and large just continue the current modus operandi, just without the veneer of professionalism. Socialists will also be able to do *actual* agitation in the Midwest and other very working-class areas as Trump's incompetence shows them that the far-right has nothing to offer, whereas if Clinton had won, the Midwestern working class would still largely be banking on a right-populist more well-spoken, more effective, and much more dangerous than Trump, while we'd have been stuck proselytizing to rich, urban liberals who, in my experience, are almost as resistant to socialism as hardcore conservatives.\n\nNeither the Democrats nor the Republicans have the workers' interests at heart; that is the message that we must present to the people if we actually want to start building up an independent left movement in the United States in preparation for the coming turmoil of the 21st century, instead of pulling a CPUSA and becoming another useless front for the Democrats and the left wing of capital.
> market "socialism"
> Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows.
If free speech means allowing everyone to have different opinions, then your appeal may have some sway with us, even though this is not an example of free speech being infringed.\n\nIf free speech means allowing fascists to organize unimpeded and prepare for whatever horrible designs they have in mind for this century, it has absolutely no place in the socialist movement or socialist society.
> different people have different definitions.\n\nI think this is key. The definition of socialism really depends on your own particular tendency and convictions. I, for example, would disagree with your "cliff notes" definition of socialism because it would include Yugoslav-style market socialism, which imo is just capitalism with extra steps. But as a Leninist, left-communists would disagree with my definition of socialism, etc.\n\nI've taken to simply not using "socialism" in my vocabulary beyond referring to the anti-capitalist movement as a whole, simply because I've gotten into a few too many arguments over semantics thanks to that word. I'd be interested to hear arguments for one definition of socialism over another that you might have, though.
I don't think he could even if he wanted to. Rojava has a sizable army and a well-armed population, while the members of the SAA definitely do not want to get bogged down in an even longer and harder war with people who have openly stated they're willing to negotiate.\n\nI guess it sort of depends a lot on Russian and American foreign policy going forwards, but I'm hopeful.
Thanks!
I suppose so. Maybe it'd be better to say that Obama and Clinton are just as eager to stick their noses in other countries' business, but Clinton is just more aggressive in doing so.
I don't see how it would be possible to have ("functional") markets if you don't have multiple distinct, independent companies (worker-controlled or not), and if you have those, you have private property, i.e. ownership of means of production by a group of individuals distinct from society as a whole who utilize those means for exchange, rather than for use.
The Manifesto doesn't really explain what Communists stand for, at least not in any appreciable detail. It's good for sticking your foot into the water of Marxism — getting a feel for his style, a general idea of his philosophy, etc. — but it was still written by a younger Marx as agitprop during the 1848 Revolutions. There are other works by him and Engels that better explain their philosophies and ideas, like *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*, *Value, Price, and Profit*, and *Critique of the Gotha Programme*.\n\nMarx didn't write *too* much about what Communism would look like; for that, /u/irltylerdurden, you'll want to turn to various different authors and get their various perspectives. I'm personally partial to Lenin (*The State and Revolution*) plus parts of Cockshott and Cottrell (*Towards a New Socialism*), but there are many other ideas on how best to structure a post-capitalist society out there.\n\nI'll second marxists.org, though: that website has been immensely helpful for me in educating myself in Marxism.
It does.\n\n> ...hence, either that big industry must itself be given up, which is an absolute impossibility, or that it makes unavoidably necessary an entirely new organization of society in which production is **no longer directed by mutually competing individual industrialists** but rather by the whole society operating **according to a definite plan and taking account of the needs of all.**\n\n\\- Friedrich Engels, *The Principles of Communism*
Remember though, as soon as two weeks before the October Revolution, Lenin himself said that he did not believe he would see a socialist revolution in his lifetime. A year after that, revolutionary fervor had spread from the Saar to Siberia, and global capitalism was facing the very real possibility of being wiped from the face of the Earth altogether. \n\nThough I'm not expecting a revolution within a year, the odds of it are not zero.
The best book analyzing how capitalism functions is probably Marx's *Capital,* in which he takes the work of Smith and Ricardo and brings it to its logical conclusion. A lot of 20th and 21st century economics is based unrealistic assumptions and their critiques of Marx largely strawmen. Capital is really tough to get through though, so I'd recommend starting off with the [Law of Value video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGT-hygPqUM&list=PL3F695D99C91FC6F7) and then moving on to texts like *Value, Price, and Profit* before attempting Capital (which David Harvey has a series of lectures available online for). All of these texts are available on marxists.org.\n\nAs for whether to start by learning about theoretical Marxist economics or the more practical applications, I'd say it's up to you. I myself have mixed them a bit (starting with some theory, then reading some practice despite not finishing with the theory, etc.), but there's no real "right" way to do it. Just make sure that you're fully comprehending what you're reading, I guess.
Would market socialism differ in several key ways from modern, neoliberal capitalism? Sure, I think that's not too objectionable. But I think the core of Marx's original critique of "normal" capitalism (exploitation of labor-power, regular economic crisis, alienation, and most important of all the tendency of the rate of profit to fall) would nevertheless still hold.
I think it has more to do with Julian Assange promising to hand himself over if Manning's sentence were commuted, tbh...
How would that explain his expanding of our campaigns into Yemen and Somalia, though? I think Obama is just as much a warhawk as Clinton is.
What do you mean "it should be recognized for what it is"? Do you mean that we should claim that the Democrats and Republicans really are different at heart, that we should feel positive about his legacy of neoliberalism failed imperial projects in general, or what?
Private property as in "individual capitalists own means of production"? No, but not even the modern United States, the most capitalist country to ever capitalist, really has that either. But private property as in "independent economic-productive actors owned by a group of individuals not accountable to the democratic will of *society as a whole*"? Yes, else you wouldn't have economic competition, and hence, you wouldn't have markets.
How would the general strike be maintained without violence? You know that capitalist governments have a long history of using their militaries to break large, threatening strikes, right? And that workers would have to defend themselves with lethal force?
Time for a good ol' [*shturm zimnego dvortsa?*](https://visibleprocrastinations.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mech-history.jpg)
In Russian-language news and articles, it's usually «сделаем Америку снова великой» *(sdelayem Ameriku snova velikoi)*.
We don't hate fascists because they're big meanies who have questionable ethics, we hate fascists because they're the epitome of the capitalist reaction and because the stuff they will do if they ever get to power is so horrific that we must resist every one of their advances with whatever means at our disposal. Being from a Belarusian Jewish family, I'd rather not see 90% of us wiped out again because liberals are more comfortable repeating cowardly neo-Chamberlainite moralist platitudes than actually getting off their asses and standing up against oppression for once.
What exactly is preventing the SDF forces in North Aleppo from connecting Afrin to the rest of Rojava by marching south of Turkish lines near Al-Bab?
I'd say it's maybe fairer to call him Marxian instead of Marxist. He incorporates some of Marx's analysis, but doesn't seem to agree with Marx's conclusion that the problem is less in that companies are run hierarchically and more in markets and the accumulation of capital generally.
Not sure if I'm interpreting you correctly, but both the MLKP and the TKP/ML are fighting Syria under the IFB, the foreign wing of the SDF.
What qualms exactly do you have with the PSL?
Whoops, my bad.
Or how Mussolini was initially propped up by the Italian government when revolution seemed imminent during the Biennio Rosso.\n\nOr just in general how liberals will viciously defend free speech for fascists but the moment a communist expresses their views or organizes a protest...
As far as I'm aware, those are the places where the workers' movement has the most potential. \n\nIn China, direct action and labor protests have been on the rise very, very quickly, and many people are realizing that the current government is not working for them or still beholden to socialism or democracy. Many young Chinese people are dissatisfied with the way things are going, and very well may support a revolution were one to happen in the future. A Chinese revolution today would spell Game Over for capitalism imo, because I don't think that capitalism could survive having its new industrial heartland torn from its body and turned against it.\n\nIn the Philippines, there already is an active Communist insurgency against the government, which has been put on hold temporarily. However, it has large support among students and other young people, and I've heard it will resume operations soon, so we may see success on that front soon as well. The Philippines is also decently large for a country at about 100 million, and could serve as a catalyst for larger revolutions elsewhere.\n\nFrance is much less certain, but over the course of 2016 a very promising protest movement emerged in response to the "Socialist" Party's neoliberal labor reforms, gained popularity, and went through all the motions of radicalization, becoming anti-government and to some extent pro-Communism as well. It remains to be seen how that movement will fare under the next president (probably Fillon, who wants to deregulate labor even more than Hollande does), but should it return in full force and re-mobilize the French working class, the odds of a revolution in France would be non-zero, and a revolution in France could set off a chain-reaction of revolutions across Europe and the world as a whole.\n\nOf course, there are other places that could serve as catalysts for broader revolution as well — India, Greece, etc. — but in most everywhere else the workers' movement is in much less a good position to seize and hold power, as they are in China, the Philippines, and France. That's why I'll be watching those three countries very closely over the next few years, personally.

Not to mention that a revolution in Latin America or China is much more likely than a revolution in America. The inevitable repression aside, our work may become much easier when we can point to a real life example of socialism in practice again and say "look, they did it over there, so we can do it here too." It was true 100 years ago, and it's still true today.
I mean, I understand the sentiment. I'm Jewish myself and vehemently deny the legitimacy of any Jewish state in the Middle East, but most other Jews I know are reluctant to denounce Israel at best and *"haha look at those silly Palestinians getting blown up by glorious Jewish missiles, don't they know that if they keep throwing rocks they'll get their homes and families blasted to smithereens"* (not even exaggerating, I've heard people say this) at worst. Sure, the statement could have been worded better, but I'm not sure it's strictly incorrect.
rip my flair then
I'm somewhat partial to Michael Parenti, who's a pretty hardcore Marxist.
There was the whole Nuit Debout anti-neoliberal protests but those died down months ago...
I thought the president was appointed by the National Council? AFAIK Cuba's government is very similar to the early USSR's, where you have local soviet elections to send delegates to higher levels of soviets, up to the national level, which appoints people to all the important positions.\n\n[Here's a book you might find relevant.](https://books.google.com/books?id=tFQ7bVuGkBsC&pg=PA103&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false)
I'd call myself a Trot (in that I mostly agree with his analysis of the USSR and how it got to that point) but I am definitely more a fan of the PSL, the KKE, and ML partybuilding tactics in general than SAlt, Antarsya, and Trotskyist tactics. The ML parties can be a bit ivory tower and unapproachable at times, imo, but that's a much easier problem to fix than the Trotskyist parties' indefinite collaboration with social-democrats.
What's Macron's stance on the neoliberal anti-worker legislation Hollande pushed through last year? Would he continue to dismantle workers' protections or largely leave them as they are?
The market socialists can define and critique capitalism however they want, I don't really care given how well Marxist definitions and criticisms have weathered the test of time. But, as is true for any system that claims to break with capitalism and not just market socialism, if it walks like capitalism and it talks like capitalism, it probably is capitalism, and maybe your definition wasn't really sufficient for isolating the essence of the capitalist mode of production to begin with.
Thanks for the recommendation! I neglected to include Marx's own analyses of capitalism and its inevitable collapse simply because, in my experience, people you may be talking to are more unnerved by the "practical failures" of capitalism than the "theoretical implications" of having such a mode of production, even though the latter is much more useful when it actually comes to *understanding* how capitalism works. It is dangerous, though, to fall into the trap of thinking that capitalism is theoretically perfect or that it can be reformed into something half-functional.\n\nI'll definitely give that book a read though!
The early '90s were a different time...\n
I don't want to get into a huge debate about whether self-exploitation is a thing or not, but regardless I think that market socialism simply doesn't address the core of Marx's criticism of capitalism (a claim which is also contingent on the existence self-exploitation but again agree to disagree). A market-socialist society would still have the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, and hence would trend towards environmental unsustainability and political upheaval in the long run.

Even so, both Marx and Darwin used the philosophical tool of dialectical materialism to reach their conclusions about how the world around us changes over time. In a lot of ways the comparison between what Marx did and what Darwin pretty apt.
Rojava is much more like Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War than the Soviet Union, i.e. libertarian socialist and anti-state in conception but more Marxian (though not quite as much as the Communist countries of the 20th century) in practice.
Support for markets = support for capitalism
When do you add the random "и" after a particle like "но" or "как" and when do you not? I understand it's used for emphasis a lot of the time (like adding an "even"), but I'm sure there's more to the rules than that.
I think that's maybe a bit too much to expect from one year alone, but over the next decade or so I think we will definitely see Europe wane in the shadow of a resurgent Russian Federation, and revolutionary potential in places like China, the Philippines, and maybe France grow in lockstep with fascism most everywhere else. Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine will probably be the first to really get the restoration-of-fascism ball rolling, but I think in time nowhere will be safe. Between that and the coming climate crisis, I'm just mostly hoping for the Chinese, Filipino, or French working class to go fullcommunist and save our asses.
I mean, the bourgeois state obviously doesn't give two shits about the legality of their actions, even if it's them writing the laws. In another Red Scare scenario, I get the feeling that socialists would be in essentially the same amount of danger if we did allow the death penalty as if we didn't. Laws are no impediment to a ruling class needing to crush a nascent revolutionary movement.
In (M)L, the state controlling the means of production is a necessary but not sufficient condition for socialism. Much more important is that the economy is structured such that key features of capitalism — wage labor, accumulation of capital, etc. — cannot be reproduced. China's model does not satisfy those conditions, and so it's fully state capitalist; a model like [Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell envision](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/new_socialism.pdf) does, though, and so would most definitely be socialist.\n\nFor me personally, I'd say that the statement "under socialism, all the means of production are owned by the state" isn't incorrect, whereas the statement "socialism is where the state owns all of the means of production" is.
*AUTOMATED*
I totally agree that revolution is possible in the United States. I just don't think 2/3 support is realistic or necessary. Historically, the tipping point for revolutions occurs when the population is divided into thirds (1/3 for, 1/3 against, 1/3 neutral or undecided), and I just think if/when we reach that point here and the US is genuinely on the brink of revolution, we shouldn't turn around and say "no, no, we're not ready yet, we need a majority of people on our side before supporting this going through."\n\nIt's a pretty minor qualm because revolutions tend to happen whether Communists in those countries want them to or not (the Bolsheviks famously only began agitating in earnest in Russia when it became clear that the Provisional Government wouldn't last another few months), but even so I'd hate to see us come so far only to throw away a historic chance at changing the course of history altogether because the revolutionary movement doesn't have an absolute majority of the population behind it.
I actually did write down a [rough translation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/10vgwxna0ytwl06/TheGermano-SovietUnion.pdf?dl=0), looking through my Google Drive, because I thought that this document was especially interesting. It's not perfect, but I think I got all the trickier idioms and expressions that Google Translate normally sucks at.\n\nEDIT: Looking over it now, I definitely did make a few mistakes. Nothing that changes his main point, though.

Long answer: [Lenin's *The State and Revolution,* Chapter 5](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm).\n\nShort answer: In the transition between capitalist and communist society, it's vital that the common people be empowered to shoot down any attempts made by the former owning class to re-establish capitalism. Since the people for whom socialism is in their interests are a great majority and the former ruling class a tiny minority, the best and most effective way to implement this is to have a direct-democratic or council-democratic system of governance, along with other anti-bureaucratic measures, which will create a much fuller and more legitimate democracy than can exist under capitalism.\n\nDemocracy is an essential part of the socialist movement in general; how can we claim to represent and lead the naturally-arising people's movement for their own liberation if we do not support their empowerment after capitalism is overthrown?
They also worked on the new Berserk anime.
In support of it.
While I doubt I'll have any, if I do I'd be hoping to show them Danny Phantom.
You can't wait to vote against gay rights?
Probably by being dead.
"Nah I don't take fall damage" \n\n*takes fall damage less than a minute later*\n\nNever change, Arin.
Liden Films? Oh, NO.
That's unfortunate, because if Trump gets what he has proposed none of that will happen. People will just get fucking kicked out.
I kinda doubt that this is true in the slightest. I live in the South, and most people put their carts away here. Very rarely see carts just hanging around the lot. Meanwhile, a friend in Minnesota claims that he regularly finds carts in the lot every day during his job at Walmart.
I was once told by a girl a few semesters ago that she used to masturbate to my voice back when we were in high school.
She also wants to revoke gay marriage rights in France, so any of her supporters/apologists can stop saying that she and the FN are pro-LGBT rights.
The thing that always baffles me about these far-right party programs is how absolutely arbitrary it seems many of their proposed measures are. Why that specific number of added prison cells? Why that specific number of allowed immigrants? Why are these numbers so valuable and statistically/logistically important? I never see any reasonable explanation for why these kinds of numbers and measures are chosen, other than "these things are good," when in reality there's no good excuse for these things to be implemented.\n\nOh, and as always, they're anti-gay marriage, so they can stop claiming to be protecting us LGBT folk from le scary mooslems from now on.
I lost a piece of a seashell that I used to keep on my desk to give my left hand something to play with while I browse the web. One day, it was just gone, and I've never found it. Suffice it to say that finding a replacement object has been an absolute bitch.
Yeah, no, the Civil War was about slavery. Pretty much any and all "arguments" positing that State's Rights were more important are just attempts to whitewash the racialized nature of the Civil War.
You don't have to be fleeing war to be a refugee. And this isn't "leftist bullshit" or whatever, it's the simple legal standard which has been in place for decades.
Easiest tends to be a tie between most South American nations. Toughest is, ironically for me, Poland.
Large parts of it come from reverberations from the release of Supersize Me and the truth of the "hot coffee trial" that McDonald's went through. The rest is simple exposure effect, as they're the biggest fast food chain on Earth while remaining consistently one of the least healthy places you can eat at.
Because if he succeeds, I'll see friends of mine fucking exiled from their homes.
Meet the new anti-immigrant party, same as the old anti-immigrant party.
You can seek refuge from oppression, not just war. Hence why you can apply for asylum in countries that are signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention for more circumstances than just war.
Because it's the maximum, not the recommended average. 
Current polling indicates a strong lead for Fillon in a second round vote between him and Le Pen, although said lead isn't as strong as Macron's is against Le Pen for example.
Given that they're trying to make ANOTHER Power Rangers movie, I'll say that one. I've never seen a good incarnation of that beyond the original, and even the original isn't totally within my tastes.
I'm not into it either, personally. Just seeing it reminds me that the person who has it probably isn't that healthy, and that's just really distracting for me.
Anarchism is a strictly ancap-free zone
No matter what side you're on, no matter how far right or left or close to the center you may be, you are not alone. No matter how little or how much the Trump administration's words and actions have affected you, you are not alone. There are others like you, other people celebrating, other people mourning, other people cheering, other people crying. Whether or not you like what's going on, we can be fairly certain that we'll come out the other side. If things go well, then that's great. If they don't, then we'll have learned plenty of lessons on how to improve. But most of all, we've always got a chance to improve, and there's nowhere to go but up.
The male guardianship law literally only applies to Saudi Arabia.
Freedom. I think a lot of people in the West have gotten so accustomed to stability and political freedom that we don't recognize just how desirous it is when you DON'T have it. This leads to ignorant, arrogant statements like "the Middle East needs secular dictators to prevent islamic theocracy" or anything like that. It's frustrating to no end to hear this kind of shit.
I'm regularly downvoted for my political opinions on the larger subs (worldnews and europe), but that's about expected given that I'm a communist.
Mostly education and the legalization/spreading of meaningful family planning methods, but it should also be noted that overpopulation is a quite overblown issue. All reasonable projections have us leveling out at 11 billion and dropping from there, and at current resource/production ratios we will be able to reasonably support such a population with fair distribution.
I was very pleased with the amount of solidarity I saw out there. It helps knowing that no matter how bad it could get in the next 4 years, at least we've got each other.
Deporting all illegal immigrants?
Tupac, Changes.
Maryland, Soda.
True, but I'd also wager that further splitting the lines like this has a high risk of damaging the political unity these kinds of parties usually manage to demonstrate in European countries. Especially so if they gain few new voters, instead just trading off voters between their party and the old anti-immigrant parties.
I get the fatigue, believe me. I come from a circle where this is essentially day-in-day-out stuff for us and has been for even longer than the Trump presidency, this has just aggravated it further. Just gotta remember that this too shall pass, but only if we're making sure it does.
This isn't really unexpected. The entirety of the 90s in Russia saw an economic depression harsher than even Germany in the 30s. There was a bounce back in the 2000s, but now things are getting worse and people are nostalgic for the stability that the Soviet Union provided. 
It wasn't a single event, moreso the accumulation of small experiences and feelings which brought me to the conclusion that God probably doesn't exist. By the time I was around 12 or 13, that belief had been solidified, and once I had gotten to that point there really wasn't any solid reason for me to go back.
Would they really prefer Melenchon to Macron?
I occasionally treat myself to a better orgasm now. 
Irrelevant. You can apply for asylum for conditions of oppression outside of war.
I certainly wouldn't call his style like that of Trump's or Wilder's, moreso his substance. I can't think of many earlier popular European politicians who claimed that Islam was the enemy of the West, after all, although I wouldn't be surprised if there are some I haven't heard of.
Yes, the list of reasons is already quite long, but the most recent one that made me feel awful about this whole thing was his retraction of protections for trans students. 
Half of the things you listed didn't even happen in Germany...
Nope, not particularly interested in power rangers on the whole really.
Oh no, they think the hallway is purposefully long. Well, at least it's nothing more than a small timewaster.
Oh not the original film, the original show. 
This is promising news; most people are incredibly susceptible to widespread fear, regardless of actual statistical realities in terms of such threats. Let's hope most Germans continue to be level-headed into the near future.
It ended with a special called Phantom Planet. Spoilers if you don't wanna know what happens, but Plasmius accidentally gets a giant ghostly meteor heading on a path right for earth. It can't be touched or damaged by ghost powers or Earthly weapons, so Danny has to convince all the ghosts from the ghost zone to help him make the planet intangible long enough for the meteor to pass safely through. They succeed, the ghosts head back to the ghost zone, and peace is restored. Danny's secret identity becomes revealed and he's accepted by both his parents and everyone else, Tucker becomes mayor of Amity Park (somehow), and Danny and Sam finally hook up while Plasmius is banished to space forever. All in all, a fairly solid ending.
What I reasonably can. I recycle as much as possible and give info about recycling to all those I can, I commute/walk wherever I go, I turn off electricity and lights when I leave rooms, I don't use my AC/heat very much, etc. I also try to spread awareness of climate change issues to my friends and family, who are thankfully quite open to info and changing lifestyles.
Elaborate WHAT? What could it possibly be?
It's fun.
While not Swedish myself, I do have a number of friends there, and access to statistics on crime and employment. The general trend, at least statistically, is mixed. Crime has risen, though not enormously, and official reports mostly blame a rise in a) reporting, and b) internet-based fraud. Employment has actually been on a positive trend, as unemployment is down and wages tend to be quite decent (although housing costs/restrictions in urban areas continue to be a problem, especially for young folk). As for the general environment, it's also mixed. There are plenty of well-integrated foreigners in Sweden, and many are on a positive path of contribution to broader society. Some will stay, some won't. On the other hand, there are those that fall through the cracks, and that is a serious problem, especially when said falling can mean turning to terrorism in foreign lands, i.e. signing up to fight with Daesh.
Her party program explicitly points out that she wishes to revoke gay marriage rights and replace them with civil unions. Did you not read it?
Jump Rope by Blue October. It was the favorite song of a very good friend of mine, so when he died when we were both 13 it kinda just stuck with me.
Not a problem, I've gotten accustomed to doing this for a lot of my friends the past couple weeks. I'm astonishingly lucky to be surrounded by the kind of people who do the same for me.
The vernal equinox.
Well, it's not that I don't care at all. I WOULD very much like a good Power Rangers film. It's just I'm not super invested in it like I am with other franchises.
I'm communist. Obviously, this means I'm usually quite used to avoiding deep discussions of politics with people I don't know well.
Making light of genocides, usually.
"It's just human nature!"\n\n9 out of 10 times it's an assumption people have come to over a lifetime of being told this by people older than them, rather than having done any actual research into said conclusion.
Almost exactly like Christopher Mintz-Plasse circa 2008.
I just kinda go along with it. Not my funeral, not my rules.
Probably Rochester. It's not exactly a fun place to be, so I imagine most people living there wouldn't even particularly mind it going away forever.
Bull testicles.
"Hijra" is the term for the recognized third-gender individuals from the Hindu tradition. It's a fairly legal and well-known phenomenon in India, so given the amount of people from there or with Indian ancestry in the States, it's not hard to see why people may desire to identify as such.\n\nAnd non-op simply means without having gone through sexual reassignment operations.
It should be noted that, by and large, the polls were correct. They all gave Clinton a margin over Trump, but mostly had Trump's chances at somewhere around 1/3. Just because they said it was unlikely, doesn't make them wrong, rather it makes them right.\n\nIn addition, the French election system is decidedly different than that of the American, and thus judging how polls reflect reality in France is also significantly different.
Crime rates in both countries rose by single percentage points last year. In Germany, this was largely chalked up to the fact that illegal border crossings are considered crimes; if you cut out the crossings themselves, then all crime (from non-violent stuff like theft to the most violent types) fell. In Sweden, it was largely chalked up to an increase in internet-based fraud. 
It's a big-ass island country. Other than that, I have no real generalizations about the place. Might be nice.
The KKE is a very old, traditional-style communist party unfortunately. They have yet to change much since they adopted the hardline Stalinist stance they took decades ago, and Putin is much like Stalin, at least in his authoritarian tendencies.
Batman vs. Dracula. It's not especially made for kids, but I watched it anyway when I was probably 7 years old. There's a scene where vampire Joker stands in the doorway of a bloodbank and it is fucking horrifying. I still think about it every now and then, and it gives me chills every time.
Dan\n\nDan you're leaving the Punis behind\n\nDAN
In the span of 2 chapters, we've gotten weed, trolling, Trump, sex, and a bomb. Basically a 10/10 manga as far as I'm concerned.
i know - that is how i meant it. the only conceivable response to the op would be insults (say, gulag jokes). since these things are not allowed, it is not clear what other response could one expect to get :)
I do what I do every year since high school; there's an area near my old house where the few homeless/down on their luck folk gather on cold nights to trade stuff they've gathered and huddle for warmth at least once a week. On Christmas, a couple of my friends and me regularly go there and sing them songs. We also bring whatever good food we can manage to carry with us, of course. It ain't much, but they seem to appreciate it a bunch.
Probably the 20s in America. "Gilded Age" my ass, this was a time before welfare even existed. Poverty was pretty damn bad, for a whole lot of people. Not to mention Prohibition.
Unfortunately, positive memorials to dictatorships and imperial regimes remain in place across Spain, alongside many other European nations which maintained colonial empires. The same is true in my home in the States.
Mostly uneventful the one time I did it. I have a friend who earnestly does believe in ghosts and the ability of people to communicate with them, so we had a seance once so I could try it out (after all, if it's real I might as well see it, right?). Tried it, nothing noticeable happened, I brushed it off and she simply said that it's fine if I don't believe in everything she does. I imagine this is how it goes for a lot of people.
Just got into comic books a couple weeks back, started by reading some golden/silver age runs of a bunch of superheroes. Do people generally care about the golden/silver ages? Are they remembered fondly or poorly? Are they discussed much? I'm just wondering if I'm an oddity when it comes to the kind of stuff that gets people into the medium. Like, would be interesting to know if most people on this sub have read golden/silver age stuff.
Civil Rights should never be a States' Rights issue. We fought a goddamn Civil War and had a Civil Rights Movement over this shit already, and both times history landed against State's Rights on this.
I'm fully aware that it wasn't legally binding. It was a display of moral principles and priorities, priorities which the Trump administration clearly doesn't share. The worst part about it is that I'm certain some schools will use this to ignore or silence trans issues, thereby leading to further isolation for trans students. If nothing is done, I wouldn't be surprised if this indirectly leads to some suicides as well.
French conservatism is the norm. In all of their post-WWII history, they've had only 2 presidents from the traditional left party.
A very manageable metabolism combined with decent height. Unfortunately, there's a good chance that metabolism will be slowing down drastically in the next few years, but for now I remain skinny while eating whatever I want and not exercising.
A whole lot of deregulation and stalling on civil rights progress, most likely.
Kind of hard to argue that Wilders was the first. There are man others, including his own predecessor, Pim Fortuyn.
The same reason you'll rarely hear about Africa or Asia except for a few key countries: most of the Third World nations don't have much sway on huge international issues, and their internal politics aren't of interest to foreign audiences. There's always the language barrier too, if you speak spanish you'll be able to find a whole lot of Latin American news if you check spanish news sites.
Kill myself. 
And we have enormous mountains of evidence that not only are laws and policies set up in such a way that disadvantages and victimizes Black people, we have mountains of evidence that police departments as whole practice significant racism against Black people, even if not all cops are racist themselves.
Yeah, because that's what Power Rangers was about right? Being edgy?
I suppose if everyone on the field died simultaneously with no explanation that would be pretty unforgettable.
Image Comics still take submissions, if you're looking to really go for it in the traditional way.
Well, Brexit clearly was an attempt by a portion of the British public to force the landmass to fly off into space. Nothing else would quite explain the divorce from reality they expected.
He didn't just put bacon on a mosque, he threw bacon sandwiches at the mosque and its members while verbally harassing them. Just felt I should add this.
I was interpreting major based on population size. Though if we're talking reputation, I would wager Rochester is not well known enough to qualify as major.
Preaching to the choir, friend. The amount of times I've encountered people unwilling to even think their nation's police force may perpetuate racism is utterly ridiculous. And while I'd wager I've seen it more often from Europeans, the denialism is definitely more vehement from my home in the States.
Oh, a bunch of things. Nutella, guacamole, milk, Chipotle, the list goes on.
I've always wanted a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow.
It is astounding to me that so many people are more bothered by the tactics of BLM than by the systematic targetting of black and brown people by intense state repression.\n\nIt proves the whole point of BLM in the first place. Black lives really don't matter that much to some people. At least not as much as some activist saying something that makes you uncomfortable
It doesn't matter what individual cops may think. If you actually look at the history of police forces, the things they actually do, and the positions they actually take, you will find that the statement you responded to is correct
Slate is not far-left, it's pretty a comfortable Clintonite center-left publication
WWII was won by the Red Army, the Korean war was not a high point, unless you consider leveling all of North Korea to the ground a high point. \n\nThe United States has rarely been on the right side of history. They were on the side of colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa and Asia, they were on the side of Apartheid in South Africa, they were and are on the side of landlords and exploiters in the Americas, and they are on the side of Israeli oppression of Palestinians. This is not an exhaustive list\n\nIn fact, I would say that the Soviet Union, despite all of their faults, was on the right side of history far more consistently than the US. They were for decolonization and national liberation, they were against Apartheid in South Africa, they were against Jim Crow and racial segregation in the US, and they were for land reform and redistribution in Latin America. Generally, wherever there was a conflict between the destitute many and the wealthy few, the US was on the side of the latter, without exception. \n\nIn terms of your last jabs at Iran, the US treats its citizens and the citizens of countless other countries like shit, they destabilize the ME far more than Iran, and instead of just calling for destruction of countries they have actually gone out and done it in various places, all for securing access to land, resources, and labor, and to maintain imperial hegemony.
Did you just compare an lgbt person being in the closet to being a cop?
The police cannot, by definition, be on the side of the oppressed.
So basically you are saying that those that are being systematically targeted by state and private-sector repression should be nice and moderate when protesting their conditions?\n\nThese are exactly the same type of arguments that "moderate whites" used during the Civil Rights movement of the 60's. 
Milo may be gay (but he believe same-sex marriage is bad, gay people should get back in the closet, homophobia doesn't exist, and trans people are icky), he may be of Jewish descent (but spends his time chumming it up with serious Anti-semites), and he may be in an interracial relationship (basically as good an argument as saying "but I have a black friend"), but he is a fascist, and he was planning to publicly harass and out undocumented students.\n\nHe needed to be stopped.
What is 'normal'? And why did you feel the need to edit that into your comment?
The piece isn't attacking Québec, really. It is criticizing certain media and political figures for using fear of Muslim refugees and immigrants in order to garner views/support. \n\nAdditionally, the issues brought forward by this article are hardly unique to Québec, and I suspect the author would agree and would have many of the same things to say about other parts of Canada.
You're being sarcastic right? \n\nThe comics on this site have been reactionary from the very beginning
Who gives a fuck if they are communists? Pull your head out of your ass. 
Death to fascism
O'Leary is only Trumpian in that he is blustering and I guess he has made sympathetic comments.\n\nBut the real Trumpian in the CPC leadership race is Kelly Leitch.
Canada is not a 'masterpiece of openness, freedom, colour-blindness, peace, and cooperation'\n\nThat is simply fantasy. It is true that Canada never had anything on the scale of Jim Crow, but is just insulting and ignorant to claim that Canada has clean hands, either historically or presently. There is not a single country in the world, let a lone the Global North, that doesn't have problems with systemic racism and discrimination. Canada is certainly no exception.\n\nhttps://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/racism-in-canada-change-and-continuity-vic-satzewich
The image is just a stencil of a photo of Leila Khaled, a stalwart of the Palestinian Liberation Movement.
I mean money is a symbol used to designate value. At the same time it is also a commodity that can be bought and sold, which plays into its unstable nature.\n\nNone of this, of course, has anything to do with Jews or Judaism.
Redpanels is much more explicitly alt-right than just ancap
Wow, you must be so proud of yourself. 
Nah OP is definitely on the far-right
Much better than a fascist-sympathizer
I should have been clearer, but I was referring to the people that the poster above was attacking with their comment, which are the people I mentioned in my original comment -communists, socialists, anarchists and the like-, not to society at large.
Nationalism takes different forms depending on the social conditions of the nationality in question. The nationalism of the Black Panther Party and the nationalism of Nazi Germany are not at all equivalent or similar. One is an anticolonial nationalism, which is formed in conditions of oppression, and which aspires for liberation. The other is a colonial nationalism, arising from the conditions that being a colonial power created, and as such took racist and genocidal turns.\n\nWith that out of the way, there is also a distinction between genuine leftist 'nationalism' and rightist nationalism. The genuine leftist 'nationalist' is a 'nationalist' only because they recognize that the current pattern of globalization has been led by the capitalist class and benefits them primarily, at the expense of workers the world over. The genuine left 'nationalist' realizes the immigrants are not the enemy and that immigration is not the problem. The 'nationalism' of the left in Canada is not one which exalts the Canadian nation -whatever that is-, or one that believes in exclusion. It is called 'nationalism' because it opposes trade deals which undermine working class solidarity, but it does not express enmity towards other people.\n\nIt is a 'nationalism' that is usually compatible with internationalism, which expresses solidarity with the struggles of oppressed peoples the world over and seeks common cause in their fight against exploitation.\n\nIn other words, I disagree the equivalence which this article is trying to make between the nationalism of the right and the 'nationalism' of the left.
This isn't a hate sub though\n\n\n... I don't even see the comment you are talking about.... nice try though
For centuries only people of very limited identities were taken seriously, listened to, or even allowed to speak on most subjects. \n\nIt certainly is progressive to allow people who actually live through certain experiences be the authority on how life under those experiences is. No-one is saying you should be disallowed to speak on certain subjects if you are a part of those limited identities, but you should realize you are no longer universally considered the authority or impartial voice and you shouldn't be surprised if you are criticized for it.
This is missing Estremaúra and Castilla in Spain, 
You know that isn't anyone's argument. You are just misrepresenting the arguments. It is true that liberalism opportunistically deploys identity politics in order to deradicalize movements, but that doesn't mean that the analyses behind them are bunk.\n\nWe are all perfectly clear that white supremacy is a function of capitalism and imperialism, utilized by the ruling class to divide the working class and bolster their power. We who point this out are not doing the divided, society is already divided. By acknowledging and understanding divisions we seek to overcome them.
I am not really a fan of putting stuff like this on the same level as white supremacy. One seems to be a response to centuries of colonization and genocide while the other is the attitude that caused it in the first place.
Fascism is an ideology, Islam is a religion.\n\nAlso, whiteness is kind of an ideology. That is, the idea of whiteness was constructed to determine whi benefits from colonialism, and it has expanded to include more people as time goes on. There is no biological factor that determines "whiteness", it is all artificial
He is probably going to win the party leadership race, too.
He probably won't win though. All of the opposition candidates except for one are backing the neoliberal Guillermo Lasso in the second round.
What are you referring to?\n\nI and many others I know are part of movements that you would probably call 'paid protestors', and I can tell you that we are all still waiting for our much vaunted checks from George Soros.
I don't think we should be worried about whether basic necessities include this little thing or this other thing when 8 people own as much wealth as half of the world's population, when billions sit in bank accounts rotting while millions starve.\n\nI think people really have their priorities backwards when they are trying to strictly fiscalize what people on benefits consume when we have the productive capacity to feed, clothe, and house everyone on this planet, yet we don't
Because firefighters actually protect people
I don't think so. The split between those who identify with and defend the public interest, public ownership, and greater social and economic equality vs those who identify with and defend private interest, private ownership, and either see social and economic inequality as inevitable or desirable is still very relevant.\n\nThe left wing 'nationalist' opposes free trade agreements and capitalist globalization because they reinforce social inequality, and undermine the public interest in favor of private interest. The right wing nationalist opposes free trade agreements and globalization in general because they see it is as an equalizing force that eliminates inequalities between their nation and other nations which they see as natural or desirable. \n\n
These people are in the US because of the legacy and present of colonialism and economic regimes imposed by the Global North which have made living in these places hazardous for many people\n
Taking a militant and firm stance against ideologies that call for genocide isn't hate\n\nSaying "black people are inferior/criminals", "Muslims should he kept out", "kick out the immigrants" is not equivalent to saying "we will fight fascism wherever we see it", "we take a militant stand to protect vulnerable people against fascist aggression", or "death to fascism" are not equivalent\n\nIf you think they are equivalent, you are part of the problem
Manmohan Singh's and later Modi's government have intensified military operations in Adivasi homelands in order to crush the Maoists, since about 2008. Things aren't looking good
Which ones have you found? The only ML organizations that do anything but bloviate about how they are the vanguard like the person above are the Workers' Party and eirigi. \n\nJust get involved with the Socialist Party (AAA) because they are the most relevant and active, even if you aren't a Trotskyist
"WorkingClassWomen"?\n\nAre these people aware that pretty much all communist/proletarian feminist tendencies are firmly trans-inclusive?
Because we all know that fascism boils down to using some sort of pressure to stop someone from speaking.\n\nYou know, nevermind the ultranationalism, anti-semitism, racialism, homophobia, and extreme anti-communism that are actual traits of fascism
I don't think it is even worth discussing anything with someone that thinks that BLM is racist.
It would have been interesting if they had succeeded. Perhaps they would have been able to resist Suharto's democidal campaign
The image is a stencil of a famous photo of Leila Khaled, a stalwart of the Palestinian Liberation Movement\n\nAnd yeah, I mean, the organization is unapologetically on the far-left
I forgot that Palestinians fighting an armed struggle against a racist occupier is terrorism.
The only way for the working class to unify to fight for their interests is if there can be solidarity between elements of the working class that have had to also be subject to different forms of oppression under capitalism. You cannot expect black workers to want to unite with white workers if those white workers dismiss their particular concerns as a distraction or unimportant. The fight against police brutality, discrimination in housing and education, and all other particular difficulties that certain sections of the working class face are indivisible parts of the struggle against capitalism.
Fascists, when not in power, often like to "take the high ground" and "be for ope n discussion" because that is the best way for them to deflect criticism.\n\nIf they ever gain power, they won't be friendly, and if you are on their shit list (basically anyone who isn't white, heterosexual, christian (or "supports christian values"), and at least not openly dissenting of their worldview) they will kill you
What sort of coup would have been accomplished by assassinating JFK? The man was entirely in line with American geopolitical interests, he was a supporter of the Bay of Pigs invasion, under his administration the vast majority of assassination plots against Castro were carried out, and other things. There is no evidence that he would have been less likely to prosecute the Vietnam war the way Johnson did.\n\nI just don't see JFK as a progressive or subversive figure that the powers that be would have wanted to eliminate.
/unjerk\n\nIt might be worth noting that this was the official position of the Communist Parties until Germany invaded the USSR in 1941.
What is wrong with the meaning? It means that those who fly that flag are willing to use any means necessary to stop fascists from ever rising to power and committing genocide again. I don't see anything wrong with that meaning.
Asturies, Aragón, Canarias, Cantabria, and Andalusia all have independence movements proper.
I mean prior to the 70's there were a number of fascists in the Dem Party, particularly in the South. Heck, David Duke entered the Louisiana HR as a Democrat. This isn't really reflective of the part as a whole.\n\nHowever, as a rule, the Dem Party is a big tent part that contains ideologies ranging from left-ish social democracy to a center-right social liberalism. 
You should read the rest of my posts
Ahh yes, the classic, racism is just a distraction from le real issues. The fact is what white supremacy is integrally tied to economic inequality, and you'll find that the people who are most concerned with systemic economic inequality, that is socialists, communists, and anarchists, are almost universally in agreement about the necessity to confront white supremacy in conjunction to confronting capitalism. \n\nLiterally everyone who I have ever heard use the argument you just deployed doesn't actually care about economic inequality and is just using it as a way to discredit struggles on other fronts.\n\n
Could you tell me exactly why you think "cultural marxism" is a thing?
I am not sure how any anger stoked up by this article could be righteous
What left wing populism?
I mean, I broadly support Antifa, I feel like you misunderstand me.
Some of us already see them as complicit.
Right, they just murder people of color, LGBT people, and leftists just for existing, SO MUCH BETTER. 
Cascadian regionalism/separatism is either liberal or fascist ([notable exception](https://communalismforcascadia.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/democratic-confederalism-how-cascadia-can-be-free/)), and it tends to the latter. 
In other words, they will do nothing.
I am sorry but you are simply wrong. Any person who has actually studied faacism understands the conditions that give rise to it and the characteristics it takes.\n\nIf you are actually interested in doing research on the subject, I would suggest Ur-Fascism by Umberto Ecco
As if Democratic officials and other liberals supported Antifa, lol.
I forgot not being a fascist means you are a "le white knight"
Wew lad, le both sides are the same.\n\nThe far left really seem to be the only ones that take the threat of fascism seriously. We don't doxx, we don't harass people, especially not because of their skin color, religion, gender identity, or sexuality. We don't advocate for genocide or ethnic cleansing\n\n\nWe are not even close to equivalent or similar
Why do you say so?
I wonder if they realize that neo-Nazis are very violent people that are constantly involved in attacks against Jews, people of color, LGBT people, disabled people, and leftists.
I see way more articles about "DAE those crazy BLM folks" than about police brutality or systemic racism.

Considering the KKE and PAME have been very strident about opposing Golden Dawn in recent years and that this article is actually five years old, I don't think it is fair to say that Greek 'Stalinists' are welcoming Golden Dawn in any way
The flag is not an issue because of Dylann Roof, it is an issue because it is a flag that has been flown by white nationalists for decades now
This is the part that least bothers me about the flag tbh
I will say this every time an article with this line of reasoning is posted.\n\nIt is kind of amazing to me that most people seem to be more bothered by the tactics of some segments of BLM than they are with the issues that BLM emerged to combat.
For context, this is not a leftist or working-class party, but the American section of the Lyndon LaRouche movement, which while Marxist-inspired in its origin, quickly became an anti-semitic, far-right organization. 
You'll find that people of all ethnic or cultural groups do shitty things. \n\nIf someone from any particular ethnic group wronging you or someone you know is enough to make you hate everyone from that ethnic group, then you might just have to hate everyone.

This isn't even a strawman tho lol
I guess I could expect a member of the all but useless CPI to talk shit about the only relevant far-left organization in Ireland.\n\nEven the Worker's Party, the IRSP, RSF, and eirigi are more interesting than your lot

The police have always been a tool used by capital to enforce its rule. Sometimes that intersects with protecting people, such as stopping drunk drivers, or every once in a while stopping rape or murder. But most of the time what they do is protect private property while harassing and marginalizing those who are most likely to favor radical change, that is the working class of all races, people of color, LGBT people, and others. \n\nhttps://lawcha.org/wordpress/2014/12/29/stop-kidding-police-created-control-working-class-poor-people/\n\nhttps://socialistworker.org/blog/critical-reading/2014/12/09/main-role-police-protecting-ca\n\nhttps://www.socialistalternative.org/marxism-and-the-state/role-police/\n\nhttp://liberationschool.org/cops-enforcers-for-the-capitalist-class/
There is no proof that Stalin hated Ukrainians. It has never been recorded in writing so it is pure speculation. \n\nStalin probably had anti-Semitic tendencies but he specifically denounced it as well, which is more than can be said about most people in his period.\n\nThe USSR did indeed enter the war because the Nazis embarked on a genocidal campaign into their territory, and not for 'ethical and moral reasons', but neither did the UK or the US, so I don't see why that is relevant.\n\nWhat is relevant is that while the Western powers were busy appeasing Hitler and gifting him Czechoslovakia and while Western capital was busy doing business with Hitler and bolstering his capacity to commit genocide, the USSR repeatedly tried to form some sort of pact against him with France and Britain. Of course the French and the British leadership didn't much care about fascism as long as it was content with repressing socialists and communists, in fact they quite liked that. \n\nIn the end, neither part of the Allied entered the war out of any moral reason. However, what can be said is that the Soviet people payed the blood price and defeated 80 percent of the Wehrmacht's land forces. 
Apologia for war crimes is present in any sub about American politics too, are you going to link to all of them too?\n\nIf you can't distinguish between actual hate and bigotry and something like this I don't know what to say
Communists don't think the Democratic Party are fascists.\n\nSource - Am a communist
The USSR literally saved Europe from fascism.\n\nBut really, I am not here to discuss the USSR, or the Eastern Bloc, or the PRC under Mao or any other socialist state in history. But the Swastika is the symbol of an ideology that is at its base genocidal and nihilistic. Whatever can be said about violence, atrocities, or mistakes committed by socialist states, the ideology is not at its core genocidal and nihilistic the way fascism is.\n\nAs a response to your first point, the forces that have been emboldened by Donald Trump and the ongoing collapse of capitalism and business as usual are indeed approaching fascistic territory, and in some cases are simply unapologetic fascists.
Italian Fascism may not have initially had explicitly racialist elements, but Mussolini was always clear about his disdain for Slavs in particular. Additionally, it exalted Roman historical culture as superior and even though it was willing to include other 'racial' groups in this idea, it was still supremacist.
Really? They are commemorating the October Revolution? That is very surprising to me, even with Sinn Fein in the majority. 
To begin with, Travellers are not Roma. They have similar lifestyles but are not really related.\n\nSecond, Roma are 100 percent not to blame for their difficulties, they have been one of the most excluded and persecuted ethnic groups in history in Europe.
 There is no proof Milo is Jewish, he just said once that his grandmother was right after asked if he was a fascist.\n\nMilo may be gay but he constantly makes homophobic statements and harasses trans folks, as well as encourages others to do so as well.\n\nFinally, his intent at Berkeley was to publicly out undocumented students and teach his cronies how to do the same.\n\nI find it hilarious when Milo fans inevitable bring up his being gay and alleged Jewishness as a shield when they get called out
The article is actually arguing that we should empathize with people outside of our own experience.
Dude, really? The shooting at the Mosque in Toronto just two weeks ago is only the latest example. Dylann Roof? Timothy McVeigh? That guy that shot the protester a week ago? The shooting of Jo Cox by that EDL member? The Holocaust? You are wilfully ignorant\n\n 
What you call 'left wing populism', I call people finally feeling able to speak out against unquestioned reactionary norms.\n\nAlso, systemic racism and the wage gap are real things
is a structural marxist somebody who has read poulantzas or something?\n\nregarding the first part, if you mean that the 'stockholders' will be able to build an army able to counter any action by the vast majority of the population, this does not seem to be a reasonable assumption. we are very far away from fully mechanical armies, and it is not reasonable to believe that they will arise, if they ever will, from a relatively slow process, rather than overnight. and if you are talking about real, mercenary armies, this rises a host of other problems (how do you pay mercenaries in this, almost post-apocalyptic scenario; what stops them from killing you etc). finally notice that a corollary to the rise of isis is that, given enough motivated individuals, it is not particularly hard to create a capable fighting force.\n\nregarding the second part, i disagree. not only would it not be a thorough revolution, but it would not even be mild reform. indeed, it would be a significantly more timid approach in comparison to the new deal or, earlier, breaking up standard oil.\n\nconcerning the trust itself, the fact that the state will be another stockholder does not explain anything. holding stock in a profitable company is good by itself, and the more the state owns, the less remains for private stockholders.  holding stock also gives the state decision making power (board representation, as you say). there is incentive, then, to 'usurp' this specific other stockholder. then, private stockholders would have an incentive to take the state out of their business - that is, use their political power to make sure the trust is dismantled. this would work in the same way as in the case of isps lobbying for laws preventing municipal authorities from providing broadband [link](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/isp-lobby-has-already-won-limits-on-public-broadband-in-20-states/). \n\nto put it another way: corporations resist efforts by the state to enforce regulation. there is little reason to believe that, if the state decides to play 'by the rules' (acquires stock, get into the boardroom) and try to enforce the same 'regulation' (which will now be called proposed company policy), it will face less or different resistence. and, in order to overcome this resistence, one would have to persuade the voters/propose policy positions etc. and, if we do that, one might ask desparately, why not try to persuade them for something better (say, the s word)!\n
> Unless of course you are insisting upon a straight out Luddite revolution. \n\nI have never spoken of a luddite revolution, much less insisted on it. i said that armies with relatively modest means may cause significant disruption. the example i brought up was isis, which is obviously not a luddite organisation - they use technology as much as they can.\n\nwhat I said is that the security measures you speak of have to include mercenary armies. and in a post-social order society, that is, in the absence of an overwhelmingly powerful semi-neutral agent (the state), it will take a very short time for your mercenary armies to realize that whatever you offer them can be acquired in better terms by killing you, and taking over. exactly because the only thing that makes you 'the stockholder' is the social order. therefore, there is near certainty that the 'phenomenal production capacity promised by technological advancement' would be wrest from the stockholders within days, if not hours.\n\n> This is precisely the scenario they are facing, in any event. \n\nyou confuse two different phenomena with similar, but independent effects. the optimization of car use by means of sharing, decreases the number of vehicles that are necessary for a given population. a decrease in the population, however, causes a further decrease, which happens regardless of the first. 100 people might share 50 cars, but 10 people will, even without optimizing, need 10. note also, that, from the viewpoint of the manufacturer, the ownership status of the car is of little importance.\n\n>  I happen to think it is preferable to give them better options, including socializing production capacity. \n>\n> They certainly will, if not given better options. \n\nthis is a contradictory statement. if you suggest that the ruling class can be given an option that is 'better' (for whom?), then you consider them rational actors. if they are rational enough to be persuaded by your proposal, they are rational enough to be persuaded by my argument (which is rather more basic, having to do with not dying in a post-apocalyptic wasteland and all that). \n\n> I see that it will ultimate be a disaster for them because they will destroy one another, while taking everyone else along in the process.\n\nagain, you are arguing for my point of view. the 'stockholders' do not need to be further entangled to the social order, because, even in your rather defeatist (for the dispossessed) description, the result of a radical disruption of the type we are discussing is certain, painful death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
some workers own some means of production, but the workers do not own the means of production. it is a co-operative scheme, which has multiple advantages, but, formally, the ownership of the means of production is private.
that is the reason only in the same sense in which the reason for the fact that i am eating is that i am pushing food in my mouth. the us and the ussr developed nuclear weapons because they were at war, not because they could order/persuade the industry to do so.\n\nmore generally, in your system the government is voted in by the people; if enough people are persuaded to vote for a government which desires to produce something, it follows that there is also enough people that are willing to work on producing it. again, the government is not some exo-social form, that resides outside society - it is a part of society.

> I am not claiming that at all. \n\nit is not my desire to sound condesending, but your terminology is so confusing that it is not clear what purpose it serves. when one asserts that an equation governs a phenomenon, they speak of a specific mathematical object; this object expresses the idea that two quantities remain equal as the phenomenon evolves. an example is ohm's law (V = RI), which asserts that, for a specific value of a parameter (R), two aspects of the state of the system (V, I) satisfy a specific equality. the implication is that there is no possibility of changing V without changing I. hence, the expression 'the balance of the equation tips' is meaningful. if V gets an increase somehow, then the equation becomes (momentarily) unbalanced; therefore, I moves in the direction that resotres equality. as i mentioned above, there is no meaningful equation, which governs the phenomenon you describe, and for which 'the cost of preserving social order, and the cost of providing physical security for a subset of the population' are the 'two sides'. \n\nfrom the way you phrase it, my assumption is that you mean that the cost of preserving social order and the cost of security, when plotted against time, will have an intersection, similar to the one in point A of [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Marshall's_Supply_and_Demand_Graph.png) diagram. however, for such a diagram to be meaningful, the interconnections between the plotted quantities should be clear. in this case, if one wanted a mathematical expression to plot, it would look like this CS = f(t, CW, r) + other terms; here CS is the cost of security per unit, CW is the cost of social stability per unit, t is the time (implicitly, the tech level), r is the ratio of total spending that is devoted to security and f is some function. for such a model, the intersection in time of CS and CW is meaningless, as a diagram of time is always drawn for steady CW and r. if one decides to update their policy (that is, r), based on the current ration of CW/CS, they will find that they have created a new CS'. and if this CS' is higher than CS, then the policy shift will have resulted to a more expensive scheme. and, again, we have reasons to believe that CS'>CS, especially for the case were r comes close to 1.\n\n> I am ignoring nothing. The power relationship won't even be close. The 10% will have the means to erase the 90%. \n\nnote that here you start by saying that you are not ignoring nothing, and then proceed to explain that it is ok to ignore something, because it is negligible. my whole argument is that you cannot just assume that it is negligible, because this is the heart of you point.\n\n>  My proposition mirrors exactly the case we have in the world at present. [...] I'm not talking about tear gas at this point. I'm talking about nerve gas. \n\nit is often unclear to me if you speak of a society like ours, projected a little forward in the future, or a fallout scenario. if the new society has a level of production like ours, then we cannot kill the poor, because they buy stuff; killing them will make the economy collapse. if you are talking about a fallout-style barter economy, then there is no 'stockholders', and neither a ruling class; their merceneries have killed them all, and the whole discussion about the cost of security becomes redundant.\n\n> Given the will to do so it is easy to exterminate large numbers of 'terrorists'. \n\nno, it is not. persuading large masses of people that specific people need to be exterminated requires significant propaganda effort; and propaganda is a move in the space of politics. it occasionally works, but not always, and not always in a predictable manner. \n\n \n\n

i am indeed greek, but i live in the uk for some years now; i am this guy with the terrible accent. as for my understanding you, and everybody else in this forum, are free to make judgements about it. from my point of view, of course, it looks ok.\n\nif we agree that the british state is capitalist, and that the eu is one of the international alliances of the british ruling class, i do not see any objection in campaigning for the dismantling of this alliance; except if we believe that, against good sense, the british ruling class made international alliances that run against its interests. on the other hand, it is obvious to me that a campaign that tries to portray the eu as the protector of immigrants (at the same time that the deal with turkey was made), the heaven of workers' rigths (at the time that the eu was pushing further workplace 'liberalization' on greece) and the guarantor of peace (as if libya was in the distant past) is rather myopic, at least from a leftist standpoint.\n\nmy other argument was not that labour voters wanted to score a win over ukip/con. it was, rather, that for many labour people i have talked with (a small sample, admittedly), the main argument was that the leave campaign was dominated by rightwing elements, and a win for it would empower them.  labour has a large platform - if it had supported leave, much of this perceived domination (and the associated empowerment) would have beed disrupted.\n\nto sum up, the point is not that labour should have 'opportunistically' gone against remain. it is the fact that doing so would allow it to campaign much more effectively against neoliberalism, against imperialism etc, but also against ukip and its positions. and, as a side benefit, it would give labour a good chance of winning the election, so that it can implement its program. \n\n(edit: again, to clarify, i believe that labour, as a whole, is deeply committed to neoliberalism; its position on the eu was the result of this commitment. but many labour supporters, who describe themselves as being on the left, express these positions, so, here, i take them seriously.)
if you disagree with the views or the practice of specific socialists or socialist organisations, it may be useful to offer some concrete critique, and produce some counter-points. but, this form of analysis, where you create an abstract 'enemy' figure, and try to explain its 'bad' politics does not sound very useful. further, i do not see the use of the specific type of critic you are deploying, namely, describing defects in the psyche of this 'enemy'. if not for any other reason, beacuse you do not actually have access to this information.

> Vertical integration is a thing, I promise.\n\nthe claim is not that it is not a thing. the claim is that your use of terminology is confusing, and, in most cases obscures the matter instead of enabling abstract thinking. for example:\n\n> Again, this is a thing, I promise. Transaction volume is measured in currency. When ever anyone refers to the volume traded on the NYSE it is always reported as dollar volume. \n\nvolume is a thing, and it is [exactly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(finance\\)) [verbatim](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp) [undisputedly](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollar-volume-liquidity.asp) [clearly](http://stockbee.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/what-is-dollar-volume-and-why-it-is.html) what i say it is. again, if you are using a non-standard definition, please provide it.\n\n> This is rather the reverse of what I would expect. Your customers have already become richer, and are demanding products out of reach for most people.

but if the goverment is formed by the process you outlined before (direct elections etc), then it would not need to order the industry to do it; the fact that a government that desires to obtain nuclear arms is elected indicates that there is a critical mass of workers that are willing to produce them. the government is not some alien force, it is an institution of the society.\n\n
given the current situation in the uk, it appears to me that another independence referendum would have the same ugly characteristics of the remain campaign, possibly amplified. since the reasoning for calling a new referendum would be the strong remain vote, it is to be expected that a new independence campaign would center itself around praising (spreading illusions about) the eu. from my point of view, no socialist organisation should be part of such a campaign; indeed, i fail to see how independence itself would be a worthy goal given these circumstances (then again, i am not scottish, so my priorities are obviously different).
> Technological deflation is readily observable as occurring, and it is occurring for military applications just as it is for consumer electronics. \n\nof course it is. but it will not have the effect you describe in 1 above, because the dynamics of the cost of security are not captured by the schema you use. refer to my previous post for a more detailed explanation. note that this also means that there is no critical level, to which you refer further down in your post.\n\n> Once **complete economic verticals can be replicated** shareholders will conclude that they can get on just fine without the rest of us 'useless eaters'. \n\nyou repeat this expression, but you do not explain what it means. do the shareholders find out that they can produce enough for them (both basics and luxury) without any input from the rest? so they decide that capitalism, and, indeed, society does not serve any purpose for them any more, so that they decide to put a stop to it? i mean, even if this was possible (which is questionable), it is a remote case (if not for anything else, because stockholders are at the top of the pyramid because of capitalism; it is doubtful that they would like to see it go).\n\n\n

> They don't have to be independent mercs at all, they can be employees subject to your behavioral controls i.e. tribalism. \n\nthey can be, but they dont need to be subject to control. some of the stockholders might imagine themselves to be potential immortan joes, but most will reach the obvious conclusion that they are much more likely to be the guy who was replaced by immortan joe. and the suspicion that this replacing process will not be bloodless, to use your expression again, entangles the stockholders to the current order of things.\n\n> Why would you fail to sell your commodities?\n\nbecause there are better and/or cheaper commodities in the market. because, say, you decided to rise your prices nine-fold.\n\n> It is a perfectly reasonable scenario that the economic vertical for producing transportation vehicles can be reproduced within an enclave, and the value of that product can be traded with the value of other products for which the economic verticals have also been reproduced.\n\ni cannot say if it is a reasonable scenario, because, expressed as it is in this curious jargon, it fails to be clear. if you mean that cars are not directly traded, but rather provided to the members of the enclave, under certain conditions (say, i provide as many cars as needed with my magic plant, somebody else produces as many fridges as needed with theirs, and all/some of the members of the enclave get a piece), then the cars (and whatever other products) do not actually enter the market; in this case, it is not clear how they are 'traded'. \n\n> It comes about through the process of private shareholders subsuming the state, as they seek to protect themselves from the disenfranchised. \n\nsubsuming it under what? what does this whole expression mean? \n\n> Again, the value of the market is determined by the volume of transactions, not the number of transactions.\n\ndo forgive me but this is a wierd, non-sensical claim. the 'volume' of transactions is the number of transactions, multiplied by the average cost of a transaction. there is a clear and undisputable dependence. is it possible that you are using a different definition?\n\n> This comes from the higher value of production (increased productivity) afforded by automation. That is the mechanism. \n> If a competitor can provide the same features for a lower cost then more power to them.\n\nthe situation is like this: i am a car manufacturer; for a specific level of automation,  the price of cars is x, and y cars are sold to the 10%; the switch to enclaves etc happens; i decide to make the price 10x; neither the level of automation, nor the other income of my customers (the 10%) has changed; hence, my customers do not become rich**er**,  and they do not buy more/more expensive cars, and, thus, there is no reason to believe that i can make more than p = x*y from selling cars to them. \n\nthen, the effect of the switch process is that i lose whatever money i used to make from the 90%, and i do not make any new money from the 10%. further, if i decide to rise my prices so that i make as much money as i used to before the switch, i will probably get replaced by my competitors. because the stockholders do not want to make less money (or be replaced), to use your expression one more time, they are entangled to the current order of things.\n\n> I rather think the opposite is true as the threat level increases from rivals competing for the same resources. \n\nthe fact that you will need to pay for security means that the total income you have available for other stuff (whiskey etc) will decrease, not increase. of course, the case of armored cars falls under security costs, which, as i pointed out earlier, tend to infinity as the plan you propose gets implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

> The objection to 'obamacare' is purely aesthetic, as it was their plan to begin with. \n\nhowever, if one assumed for a moment that the objection to obamacare is actually not aesthetic, but rather symptomatic of a specific attitude, then your whole argument would collapse. to be more specific, if one is willing to concede that the healthcare companies and their agents do not fight obamacare because they are idiots, but because they see no reason to make even the most trivial of concessions under any circumstances, even if that means going to extreme lengths (say, the various strange supreme court cases, the refusal by congress to confirm garland etc), then there is also no reason to believe that they, and the rest of the ruling class, will accept to play by the rules (within the realm of politics) as the government of your choice tries to disempower them. and, therefore, no reason to believe that the violent conflict you are afraid of will be avoided. \n\nto put it another way, your belief seems to be that the answer to a government that tries to pass the trust-tax breaks package will be a ruthless political campaign. but to me, a coup sounds just as possible (maybe even a soft coup, in which the new government will take the 'reconcillation' approach, by implementing half of your proposals, namely, the tax breaks). in which case, there is still no discernable benefit to the alternative scenario, in which you tell to the people 'we are going for the s word, and the ruling class might try to fuck as, so be prepared'.\n\nof course, you assert that the carrot is big enough, that this is the best available plan, that no better package will become available. but, surely, if we look around reddit we will find people from 2008, claiming that going for romneycare instead of the public option was a genious move, since the republicans obviously could not denounce their own plan.\n

> This is analysis of the communities I've found myself in as a radical, not a specific organization. \n\nbut a community is not a well-defined subject of politics; it does not hold views, neither does it have attitudes. it is unclear then what we should do with this analysis, except try to apply it to specific subjects of politics (individuals, groups, parties etc). what i am saying is that you should point us to the direction of these actors, so that we can better understand and verify your points.\n\n> It is an attempt to explain the difficulty for the fabled "white working class" to truly radicalize around demands as opposed to radicalizing their rhetoric in public, yet practice the same misogynist and racist views that they would usually protest.\n\nin this case, you explain what we know and are able to observe (racist, misogynist attitudes), by what we do not know and is inaccessible to us (the internal workings of the mind of this specific people, and the interplay of their unconcious views with their expressed positions). this is a curious way to explain stuff. it has little explanatory value, and it is impossible to verify. and, besides, it gives no new hints about ways to act (one should combat misogynist views, of course, but it is not clear why your analysis is necessary to reach that conclusion). \n\n\n
given the result of the referendum, it was to be expected that labour would have difficulties winning; and the internal fighting could only amplify the problem. the referendum showed that the party is out of step with many of its voters (and even more of its potential voters), and it left labour without a narrative to promote (vote for us, because, even though we did not want brexit, we will do it better? vote for us, because, even though you want brexit, we will stop it?). \n\nhowever, optting to campaing for remain,  a no-win option for his party, is hardly something that can be blamed solely on corbyn. most of the plp supported this dead-end strategy even more passionately. then, it makes little sense to replace corbyn now. the only thing that labour can do is wait and see. oppose the tories on labour's core issues (nhs, poverty etc), see how the brexit goes, and act accordingly.\n\nedit: not a corbyn/labour supporter.

An enemy to be polarized against. I would not be surprised if battling enclaves even employ them against one another. Do you believe that class consciousness will survive tribalism?\n\nthis is gibberish, and also completely unrelated to my point. briefly: your assertion that there will be some benefit to the stockholders in abandoning social order is misguided. see my previous post for details.\n\n> This is simply a matter of increasing unit volume.\n\nno it is not, at least from the perspective of the individual stockholder. you can add these things to your cars, but there is no guarantee that they will sell better than cheaper, simpler models; so you are driven out of the market. except if your assertion is that there is no market to begin with, as i said some time ago.\n\n\n
> The connection is that, directly as a result of technological displacement, the social stresses faced by the displaced could be expressed as either tribalism, or as class consciousness. But ever since Bernays, capitalists have continually fine tuned the ability to rally the public behind brands. Tribalist conditioning is deeply ingrained in LSC. And shareholders will gladly sit back as West Midlands and West Bromwich Albion bash each others skulls.\n> \n> \n> And then there is such pettiness as the spate of banning from the LSC sub... Sad, and it doesn't bode well.\n> \n> So yes, my expectation is that the dispossessed will sooner be be pit against themselves than be directed any focused manner against shareholders. Another case in point: Trump Supporters. \n\ndo forgive me but that is no connection at all. the point made here is that, in the absence of a state, and of any particular after-fallout useful skill, the stockholder cannot persauade mercenaries not to kill him. he has nothing to offer them, which cannot be acquired easier by killing and replacing him. \n\n> Yes, that is the very reason that trucks and SUVs are sold today in favor of less expensive vehicles. If unit volume is allowed to go down so does the income of auto manufacturers. \n\ntoday, they prefer to sell expensive cars to selling cheap cars. however, if the total number of cars sold decreased by, say 80%, most car companies would go out of business, regardless of the ration of expensive to cheap cars they sell. the income of the manufactures depends both on the number of cars sold **and** on the price of one unit. if one of those things increases, while the other decreases, the income remains the same. therefore this is not an argument for your point.\n\n> As a matter of speculation increased unit volume can be supported in any number of ways. \n\nas a matter of speculation it might. but if the price of a commodity rises tenfold in a short period of time, it is also reasonable to assume that some of the potential customers will turn elsewhere; this is taking into consideration the 'improvements' one can offer - after all, a car is a car.  in this case, and assuming that a market exists, it is also reasonable to assume that a new firm will drive the stockholder out of the market, by competitive pricing. in order to avoid that, the stockholder is forced to accept lower prices, and there is no benefit for him.\n\n> We have already discussed the irrationality of aesthetics. \n\nyou: the stockholders will do A.\n\nme: why will they do it?\n\nyou: because the relative benefits of not doing it will have vanished.\n\nme: actually, it is easy to see that taking action A will be a disaster for them, and  they have no rational motive to take it.\n\nyou: you dont get it, they adhere to an irrational, yet consequential mode of aesthetics - they dont need rational motives.\n\nby this process, i can argue for anything.\n\n\n

> I think you are miscalculating the capability of the industrialists to force multiply.\n>\n> We don't have to discuss fully mechanical armies, but we do have to discuss force-multiplied ones. \n\nthe multiplication of zero with any finite number yields zero as a result. the point of a force multiplier is that it enhances the effectiveness of your forces. an obvious precondition for this to happen is that you have some forces to begin with. if these forces are not fully robotic, they have to be mercenaries. and then, everything i said still holds (that is, they kill you). \n\n------------------\n\n> Here you are thinking like a neoliberal again. It is more likely the case that a neo-feudalist enclave will build their own cars given the phenomenal means to means to do so. This is a consequence, as I say, of the ability to "replicate economic verticals". \n>\n>  They are richer by virtue of controlling stock capable of phenomenal production capacity. \n\nagain, the assumption i am working under is that there is a market; namely, that, say, cars are produced as commodities to be sold, rather than as use values. and, if i fail to sell my commodities, then my position worsens. if you want to reverse your previous position, and assert that there will be no market, then, of course, what i say about prices and competitors is beside the point. \n\nfurther, the narrative i am working with is that some people, the 'stockholders', who are already in control of the productive capacity, decide to take radical action and dispense of what we call social peace. this premise explains why they are rich to begin with, but not how they will become richer. this is for you to explain.\n\n\n> That is never a claim that I made. My claim is not that they will stop caring about things, but that they become dominated by an ethical mode which abandons what in today's society would seem reasonable. \n\nif they abandon what seems reasonable today, and desiring not to die is reasonable thing today, then you just made the claim you said you have never made. in general, you posit a process that you have named 'abandonment of the values of enlightenment' or, alternatively, endarkening. however, you do not give any indication as to why this proccess will come about.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n> Not necessarily. But it isn't even a matter of the number of transactions, it is a matter of the volume of transactions. \n\n\nnecessarily. the number of transactions depends on the number of customers and the (average) number of transactions per customer. if you have few customers, they have to buy multiple times for the same effect. \n\n> But it isn't even a matter of the number of transactions, it is a matter of the volume of transactions. \n\nthe amount of money that comes in your pocket, ignoring taxes, depends on two factors. how much stuff you sell, and how much you sell every unit for. in a simlified scenario, the relation is as follows [money you make] = [number of transactions]x[money per transaction]. if the number of transactions (which depends on the number of people buying, again, necessarily) goes down, then, for the same amount of money you have to increase your prices. you may decide to switch your product, but this changes nothing. you either have to sell more (in the new, smaller market), or you have to sell more expensive.  \n\n> A market with fewer larger transactions can work as well as a market with more smaller transactions.\n\nit could, in principal, but this is immaterial. the point is that the majority of stockholders will not be better off, so they have no reason to enforce the change. you see, in order for the larger transactions to happen, people (the 10%) have to be willing to pay more money for the same type of product (say, cars). for this to happen, however, it is not enough to say that we will make more expensive products. there also have to exist customers who have increased disposable income (in relation to what they used to have). however, you have shown no mechanism via which this income will be generated. \n\nfor example:\n> but it could necessitate a car that costs 9 times as much\n\nno it will not 'necessitate' it. some tiny minority might desire a more expensive car, but their ability to buy cars will still be what it was before the fallout. therefore, if you rise your prices by a factor of 9, they will turn to your competitors. the sum total is that you will be worse off.\n\n> They will have to pay more than they would if not under constant attack. But the cold, hard economics of the matter is that the population of attackers is not infinite. Rather, the more serious threat is the one they pose to each other, where phenominal production capacity for arms is pit one against the other. \n\nthis is an additional reason why they will not buy more expensive cars.\n\n\n\n

i know you dont mean to trivialize, but rather to explain. your expanation, however, is that huge corporations, with armies of consultants make decisions based on some misguided dedication to whatever an 'aesthetic of identitarian domination' is. my assertion is that there is a better explanation: that most of this is aesthetic (the conservative principles) is about as true for them as it is for glen beck, and it is used as a cover, because it serves the same (quite rational) goals it serves for glen beck, namely, getting richer.
do excuse me, but if the dedicated effort to get richer is  irrational, aesthetics-based desire for 'identitarian domination', i am not sure what is a rational motive. besides, if this description of yours is a way to convey to me the information that they wanted to get richer, then i am not sure how your assertion addresses my point (in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/5w25xs/a_question_on_a_postsocialist_revolutions/deazzsh/) post).

> You can secure your own property, thanks to magic lamp. \n\nno you cannot. if you have not made a huge leap and accepted fully mechanized armies, you need mercenaries to protect your property. except, the mercenaries are not the new 'working class' as you suggest; before the fallout, it was not immediately advantageous for the worker to murder his boss - doing so would not make him boss instead.  in the case of the mercenaries this is not the case; there is no benefit for them in keeping you (the stockholder) alive; you are a stockholder, not a designer - they do not need you to run stuff. therefore, your (rather painful) lifespan after the collapse of order is seven minutes. thus, contrary to your claim, the stockholders are vitally (in the literal sense) entangled with the social order.\n\n> Your automated assistant will know how many pairs of shoes to make for the market at hand. The 10% can get on just fine for themselves. \n\nthe point is not that i miscalculated - the point is that there are no customers. mechanization makes my margin of profit per unit very high, but for this to become real profit (some type of money in my pocket), i have to sell products. if i find myself selling 100 pairs of shoes, instead of 1000 pairs, i have to either raise my prices (but then the competition will crush me), or accept to make much less profit. but then i have much less capacity to buy products myself etc the whole process is deflationary, and, in the end, we stop producing any commodity and only produce use values. of course, this implies that we have any interest in selling stuff, which is a questionable assumption.
if you do not vote for the people you ostensibly support (say, jill stein), then they will never have a chance. if all the people who voted for hrc, but actually 'hated' her, had voted for a third party canidate, this candidate would(could) have gotten 10-15%. that would be good start, towards 'having a chance'.
one crosses the rubicon to decisively do something. crossing the rubicon into apraxia is a novel strategy. besides, it is not hard to imagine that automation would amplify the merits of the socialist argument. the development of the means of production is such that the living conditions of the whole population could be improved, but, because of the current mode of production, they are not.

thanks for the link. the article was not my cup of tea (too much anthropomorphising of states, too little material analysis), but it provided some interesting information. as for brexit, i cannot agree to disagree with you, because you have not addressed any of my points specifically; as far as i know, you might accept them completely :)
but your hope is, strictly speaking, irrational. even if the desired outcome (that is, no nuclear weapons) comes about, this will not be the effect of the proposed configuration (which is private, rather than 'not private and not socialized' as you suggest). 
> So you do not believe that tribalism is at odds with the promotion of class cosciousness? That is an interesting theory. \n\ni believe that your whole point in the quoted part was wholly unrelated to the point to which it was ostensibly answering. namely, that the stockholders will not be the beneficiaries of this chaotic process of social collapese, but its first victims (and, in particular, victims to the mechanism that was supposed to protect them). if you are interested, you might try to answer to this point. i am happy to discuss tribalism and its relation to class consiousness, but i do not see the connection with this point.\n\n> The entire point is for one unit of product to sell for a higher dollar volume, that is what in means to increase unit volume.

It is why they are selling more SUVs than smartly designed efficient vehicles. \n\n'more suvs than efficient cars' is a ratio. i am not talking about ratios, but about net numbers. it is clear that the number of cars these people sell will decrease to a small fraction of its initial value. the question is the following: is there a reason to believe that they can rise the price to a multiple of the initial price, so that they end up with the same effective income?  is the porposd mechanic that the other stockholders will desire to buy 9 additional supercars each? will they also drink 2 liters of whiskey a day? and wear two pairs of shoes at a time?\n\nnote that the point is not that such an economy is inconceivable or impossible (which it is, for unrelated reasons). it is, rather, that there does not seem to be any actual motive for any of the actors you describe to take the actions you ascribe to them.\n
α βεβαια, δεν υπαρχει αναγκη οι δυναμεις να ειναι ισορροπημενες. αλλα αν δεν εχουμε λογους να πιστευουμε οτι η μια ειναι σημαντικα ισχυροτερη απο την αλλη, τοτε ειναι ευλογο να τις θεωρησουμε περιπου ισες. στη συγκεκριμενη περιπτωση, το εμπαργκο δεν ειναι ουτε ο μονος, ουτε ο βασικος πυλωνας νομιμοποιησης της κυβερνησης (πχ, το συστημα υγειας και η σχετικα χαμηλη εγκληματικοτητα ειναι σημαντικοτερα αν καταλαβαινω καλα). και, απο την αλλη, δεν εχουμε λογο να πιστευουμε οτι οι κουβανοι ειναι αδιαφοροι για το βιωτικο τους επιπεδο. οπερ εδει δειξαι?
same degree of ownership of the means of production (say, for a society of 100 industrial plants, 1%) is also same degree of non-ownership of the means of production (for the same society, 99%). besides, the same degree can only be an initial condition. since the decisions are made by the individual workers of a specific plant (rather than by some type of central planning), it is to be expected that some of these decisions will be exceptionally good. then these workers will use their 50% of untaxed profits to expand, geting a greater degree of ownership
if the government tells the industry what to produce (that is, you have some sort of central planning), then why have private industry at all (regardless how much it is taxed)?
> It may soon be possible to replicate much of a complete vertical into a single facility. Including, for production of food, clothing, housing, medicine, even luxuries and of course arms. \n\nthis is the key point. when (if ever) technology allows for this kind of 'completion', i may be able to produce stuff. however, for this stuff to become commodities, they have to enter the sphere of circulation - otherwise, no profit gets realized, and i am the proud owner of a new age magic lamp. and for a shpere of circulation for my (potential) commodities to exist, there has to be a mass of people willing and able to buy my stuff. if such people (that is, buyers) do not exist, my profit never gets realized, and i find myself owning a million pairs of shoes, but only two feet. conversely, it is unclear why getting rid of the social order would be of benefit to me. the only thing that allows me exclusive use of my magic lamp is the existence of the state - without it, my property rights vanish; and even if i manage to protect myself against the hordes, there is no protection against my own men (the merceneries i use for protection etc). then, even without your system, the fate of the stockholders is doubly entangled with the existence of social order.\n\n>  Except, that because workers have been displaced they no longer have the political power they once had. \n\nof course, but this is not an immutable state. indeed, changing this situation is at the heart of any leftist conception of politics.\n\n

it seems to me, however, that even this type of compromised pseudo-feminism is an outlier among gop voters (although, i admit this is an estimate; i have no stats at this time of the night).

these people confuse what i 'want' for myself, with what i 'want' for the society i live in. one is not a supporter of communism because they want to own means of production, but rather because they oppose the (private) ownership of the means of production. that is, exactly the opposite. and something that capitalist states obviously do not allow.

> Exactly how do you propose that said disruption would translate in to a sharing of political power? Because it looks a lot like the very means by which the disenfranchised become classified as criminals and terrorists.\n\nit will not translate in sharing political power. it will translate in your factory being looted/burned down, and you personally being  murdered. the argument is not that a luddite insurection will necessarily be successful. it is that, under reasonable conditions, as the spending on social stability goes to zero, the cost of security goes to infinity (that is, you die).\n\n> That is your claim, and it is one possibility. But it is not the only possibility. \n\nit is the only possibility, with the exception of fully mechanical armies; and i though it was clear we are not discussing the latter case.\n\n> Again, I do not believe that killing the controllers of automated production means as a useful way of taking it over.\n\ni am not talking about the controllers. i am talking about the 'stockholders'. somebody takes over your house and your automated plant. they murder you and they are the happy owners of a house and a fully functioning producing facility. they are now the new 'stockholders'. this scenario is, of course, easy to predict, so the old stockholders will never initiate a process that leads to its realization. avoiding this scenario, in which they get replaced by this other people, in a violent manner, entangles them to the current social order.\n\n> Not if that 10% of the population controls 90% of the wealth. Economically it is exactly the same. Markets are not apportioned to a number of \ncustomers, but to a volume of transactions.\n\nbut the number of transactions is a function of the number of customers. even if 10% of the population controls 90% of the resources, their consumption of cheese will not rise 9 fold. their need to travel will not necessitate 9 cars. they will be unable to drink a gallon of whiksey. and, because the extermination process will not give the 10% any extra income, there is no reason to believe that they will be able or willing to pay multiples of the previous prices. \n\n> But in the case of very few privileged individuals controlling cars outright they can be made as extremely expensive impenetrable tanks, and then unit volume can be achieved that way. \n\nbut a rapid rise in the price of cars will lead them to your competitors. that is regardless of how rich they are. besides, your effort to add features to this or that product might be successful, like the iphone, or less succcessful, like the 'smart' kettle. there is no guarantee that, for the majority of products your effort to replace them by more expensive alternatives will work. and the effect is compounded by the fact that you have not described the mechanism by which the people will be richer, so that they can afford more expensive products (the stockholders were rich to begin with, but they have not become any richer).\n\n\n> The enlightenment is all about rationality, the endarkening is not. These are two different ethical modes which you are trying to conflate.\n\nendarkening or no endarkening, there is no reason to believe that the stockholders will decide that they want to initiate a process which will not make them richer or more powerful, and, in a variety of likely outcomes, will see them die in the hands of mercenaries (my scenario), or their competitors (your scenario). if your argument is that, at some point, the ruling class will stop caring about this things for no reason whatsoever (the abandonment of the enlightenment is your name for this process, it is not a reason), then it is a bad argument.\n\n\n\n
> Just another intermediary stage, like the mercenary, until they are themselves displaced. \n\nno it is not. we have literaly no idea how to automate the most simple design tasks in an unsupervised manner. it is ok to assert that some technology will be developed, but you cannot just close gaps in your argument by predicting miracles. \n\n> The danger here is not so much the henchmen as the other stockholders. Buy this time, they are the ones who have abandoned the enlightenment. The threat of other gods with magic lamps is the far more imminent threat. Straggling employees, mercenaries, whatevs, will be polarized in service to their tribe. Class consciousness won't even be a factor. \n\nboth the henchmen and the other former stockholders (for the seven minutes for which they are still alive) will be danger - but this is again an argument for my case.  some people might abandon enlightenment, but few will abandon the will to live. the current social order (that is, the state as well as a level of social cohesion) offers the stockholders this kind protection, which, as you just explained, is impossible otherwise. then, they have no reason to want to (wantonly) destroy it.\n\n> Sure there are, the other stockholders representing first 10%, then 50% , then 90% of a dwindling population. \n\nthere are some - but they are less than before. this means that, from the point of view of a stockholder, the profit diminishes (because the profit gets realized on sales, not on automation ratio), and, hence, the effective income that is available to dispose also decreases. then, the stockholder can actually access less, in terms of luxuries etc in comparison to their previous situation. where i am from, they say for this type of situation: 'διχως κερδος κερατα', which translates as 'not only we did not gain anything, but we also grew horns'.\n

> This is a popular neoliberal trope. It only holds true while the cost of providing for social order is less than the cost of providing physical security for shareholders. Two things will happen to tip the balance: 1) technological deflation will reduce the cost of security measures. and 2) entire economic verticals will be reproduced via automation. Those two elements work together to make this possible. It doesn't really do if you need the people you are destroying to produce the tools of their destruction, it becomes an exercise of diminishing returns. But once the entire economic vertical can be managed without workers, from raw materials and processing, through design and manufacturing and deployment then you are in the clear.\n\nhere, you repeat yourself verbatim. again, you are wrong, as i explained above. briefly: **there is no balance to tip**. the kind of schema you use to describe the dynamics (the scissors diagram) is not applicable here, so the conclusions you draw make no sense. there is no moment in time in which what you describe in 1 will happen.\n\non 2, i am not sure what you describe as a neoliberal trope. is there mass production? if so, somebody must buy the products - otherwise, why produce? conversely, if you own a self-reporducing apparatus that can create use-values as you need them, and somehow guarantees its owners security, then you have no commodity production, and, therefore, no capitalism/stockholders etc.\n\n\n
μπορεις να πεις συνοπτικα απο που προκυπτει αυτο? το αναποδο μου φαινεται πιο λογικο.
1. did people (any/some/many) engage actively with socialism, or did they mostly treat it as the 'state ideology' - something other people decided? i mean, did people have r/socialism style conversations on random things/policies/ideas being socialist? (not a very clear question, i know).\n\n2. how influencial was nationalism, during 'normal' times (that is, not just before the wars started)?\n\n3. any particular views about greece? 
the position of the uk as a 'geopolitical lackey' to the us is guaranteed by the participation in nato, not by the efforts of theresa may. to the extend that a campaign for independece is not explicitly anti-nato, it is not clear how any one of these evils is lesser. and, the politics of the tory party are neither less pro-austerity, nor less 'authoritarian' than those of the european union (see greece, italy, spain etc). so an independence campaign that is not explicitly anti-eu promotes a different, but not a lesser evil.  \n\nwould a new referendum be conductive to a campaign with such characteristics? or would it serve to further promote the eu as the friend of the workers, the bane of the rich and powerful and the protector of the immigrants?

of course, it is not difficult to imagine such scenaria. more than in politics, they have been quite popular in literature - were they not the entire point of cyberpunk? the point here is not to argue that dystopia is impossible (or, equivalently, that socialism is a guaranteed outcome), but rather that the concrete possibility of dystopia is what makes the fight for socialism necessary and relevant. socialism or barbarism, in a sci-fi context.\n\nof course, this type of argument implies a specific conception of history - one in which the subject of change is large social groups (classes, the multitude, whatever). taking a position against this view, would, of course, go 'somewhat against socialist principles', but, also, it seems to me, against good history.\n\nas for my readiness, i cannot say in advance; but please, feel free to elaborate.
> the bulk of the work is done by a few\n\nThat's heavily dependent on how you define "work".  If I make a crane over a year and you use the crane for 10 years, who did the work?  You, me, or the guy who bought the crane from me and permitted you to use it?\n\nOnly if you subscribe to the belief that intellectual and managerial properties are engaged in labor, on behalf of their owners, can you conclude a small number of people are doing the bulk of the work.
labour decided to campaign actively for a position (remain) and two thirds of its voters voted for this position. there is no reason to believe that if labour decided to campaign for another position, either abstention or brexit, it would not manage to persuade the same portion of its voters on it. indeed, it seems to be the case for many of the remain voters that the only justification of their vote they offer is that, while the accept that the eu is a neoliberal institution, a win for brexit would be a win for ukip, and/or it would leave the uk to the tories. this justification would not exist, had labour not campaigned for remain. \n\nand, going for the other possible positions would leave labour with a coherent narrative for the voters.  if they have campaigned for brexit, for instance, it is not a stretch to assume that around a third of the remain+labour voters would support that. then, labour would have to handle a significant victory (the end result would be closer to 60-40, than 50-50), and the campaign material would be writing itself (the government supported the losing position, we supported the winning one; let us have an election so that we can do the implementation). similarly for tha case of abstention.\n\n(to be clear, i do not believe that electing labour would be a good thing - i am not a labour voter. the argument here is that the decision to support remain made little sense, objectively.)
it would be a strech to characterize syriza a working class movement in the first place. before 2012, the main appeal of syriza was to a specific part of the middle class; namely, those who were leftist in their student days in the early 80s, and remained slightly to the left of the socialist party (pasok) in the next decades. they never had significant presence in the unions or with the working class (as a demographic). even among university students, they never were particularly significant, and there is a strong tradition of far left politics in the greek universities. therefore, i am not sure if the term class traitor applies.\n\nedit: minor changes.
> The connection is that, directly as a result of technological displacement, the social stresses faced by the displaced could be expressed as either tribalism, or as class consciousness. But ever since Bernays, capitalists have continually fine tuned the ability to rally the public behind brands. Tribalist conditioning is deeply ingrained in LSC. And shareholders will gladly sit back as West Midlands and West Bromwich Albion bash each others skulls.\n> \n> \n> And then there is such pettiness as the spate of banning from the LSC sub... Sad, and it doesn't bode well.\n> \n> So yes, my expectation is that the dispossessed will sooner be be pit against themselves than be directed any focused manner against shareholders. Another case in point: Trump Supporters. \n\ndo forgive me but that is no connection at all. the point made here is that, in the absence of a state, and of any particular after-fallout useful skill, the stockholder cannot persauade mercenaries not to kill him. he has nothing to offer them, which cannot be acquired easier by killing and replacing him. \n\n> Yes, that is the very reason that trucks and SUVs are sold today in favor of less expensive vehicles. If unit volume is allowed to go down so does the income of auto manufacturers. \n\ntoday, they prefer to sell expensive cars to selling cheap cars. however, if the total number of cars sold decreased by, say 80%, most car companies would go out of business, regardless of the ration of expensive to cheap cars they sell. the income of the manufactures depends both on the number of cars sold **and** on the price of one unit. if one of those things increases, while the other decreases, the income remains the same. therefore this is not an argument for your point.\n\n> As a matter of speculation increased unit volume can be supported in any number of ways. \n\nas a matter of speculation it might. but if the price of a commodity rises tenfold in a short period of time, it is also reasonable to assume that some of the potential customers will turn elsewhere; this is taking into consideration the 'improvements' one can offer - after all, a car is a car.  in this case, and assuming that a market exists, it is also reasonable to assume that a new firm will drive the stockholder out of the market, by competitive pricing. in order to avoid that, the stockholder is forced to accept lower prices, and there is no benefit for him.\n\n> We have already discussed the irrationality of aesthetics. \n\nyou: the stockholders will do A.\n\nme: why will they do it?\n\nyou: because the relative benefits of not doing it will have vanished.\n\nme: actually, it is easy to see that taking action A will be a disaster for them, and  they have no rational motive to take it.\n\nyou: you dont get it, they adhere to an irrational, yet consequential mode of aesthetics - they dont need rational motives.\n\nby this process, i can argue for anything.\n\n\n
surely, here you are making my argument for me. the reason i mentioned obamacare was that i was making a specific point, namely, that the ruling class is willing to fight tooth and nail against a plan that is only a tiny fraction of what you envision. then, we have no reason to believe that they will not use any means necessary, including violence (again, say, a coup), to prevent your plan. then, the whole rationale for its introduction vanishes, and it is not clear why we need it.

what actual contradictions is it pointing, though? do the women who voted for trump consider themshelves to be part of the feminist movement? is anybody suggesting that there should be unity with trump supporters? 
but since there is thousands of working class voters for every capitalist woman, i would expect such attitudes to be relatively rare in general. still, i do not know who suggests that there should be unquestioning unity with 'capitalist women'. the only obvious exception to that is hillary clinton, but i doubt that this kind of unity is the target of the critique we discuss.

i am not sure how the first part follows - please try to explain it. on the second, if the government decides what is produced, then 'exclusive control' is actually just democratic control of the workplace (say, elected rather than externally appointed managers etc). having a democratically run workplace is, of course, important, but it is not clear why it necessitates private enterprise; one can easily imagine such a configuration in a fully socialized industry.
i understand the need for polemics, in some contexts, but mitropoulos here is taking it up to eleven; the positions she ascribes to jacobin (strong boarder controls, alignment with AfD) are explicitly rejected in the piece she is ostensibly discussing. \n\nmore generally, her position seems* to be that a wide range of 'anti-neoliberalism' positions should be regarded as purely nationalisitic, and thus dismissed (this was clear, say, to her piece on klein/sanders after the us elections). it is unclear how this critique leaves any space for political engagement with, say, trump voters or brexiters on any terms.\n\n*not that i am an expert, so please correct me if i am wrong.

> I am actually talking about the cost of preserving social order, and the cost of providing physical security for a subset of the population as two sides of an equation. \n\nthese two things are not part of a meaningful equation though. you cannot have an equation were the one side can change independently of the other. again, the issue you seem insistent on ignoring is that, as the desparation of the population grows (ie as funds are diverted towards security), the effectiveness of security spending decreases. it is easy to suppress anti-trump rallies, but not so easy to suppress food riots; the fact that it is cheaper to produce tear gas does not change this basic fact. it is only by your decision to ignore this aspect of the dynamics that allows you to assert that diverting spending from 'social order' to 'security' would 'feed into the dynamic' you describe.\n\n----\n\non the second issue, you contrast your approach with armed conflict, which indicates that you believe that the ruling class will accept your plan relatively passively; that is, at least, they will accept to play by the rules of a game that, increasingly, disempowers them. of course, the alternative scenario is that they will see through you plan, and through your sweetener tax deal; they will describe it as an anti-market heresy, and resist it by any means necessary (and, one has to assume that these means might become violent, hence, more armed conflict). after all, we are talking about the people who try to ban municipal broadband, the people who found obamacare to be too intrusive and socialistic in nature.\n\nthe only meaningful difference with the case of preparing a socialist revolution is that, in it, you actually prepare the subject of the proposed change (the working class*) for the possibility of a violent turn (that is to say, that there is no peacful resolution of their conflict with the ruling class). as a side note, the most obvious result of your approach seems to me to be that the elites will embrace the tax-break part of your plan, while rejecting the other.\n\n*which includes the unemployed. i am not very insistent on terminology for the purposes of this conversation; use the 'masses', the 'dispossessed' or whatever, if you must.\n\n

> over a majority non white nation\n\nwhat do you mean here?
on the first part, i think the disagreement is the following. you operate under the assumption that the cost of security is proportional to the level of technology. this is obviously true. you also seem to assume that this cost is constant, with respect to changes in the material conditions of the 'non-stockholders'/the dispossessed. my assertion is that this is an unreasonable assumption, and that a more realistic model would have these two things (cost of security - welfare of the masses) be inversely proportional.\n\non the second part, you are right; i took you proposal to be much more modest than you describe in your last post. still, my other objection remains. for a reform of this kind to succeed, mobilization of huge political forces would be required. you might be unwilling to call this a workers' revolution, but it does quack lick a duck, and, more importantly, it is about as difficult to organise. but if it does not make things easier, then why go for this approach? except if it is your view that the ruling class will appreciate the fact that we do not intend to immediately, ehm, expropriate them, but we prefer a more measured approach.

a little obvious, but people's history of the us (by h.zinn) has a couple of very well-writen chapters on the civil war and reconstruction. 
they have ownership, but they can use their profits to obtain more of it. say, by aquiring more land, newer machines etc. maybe it is easier to envision the opposite scenario: some workers might make bad decisions, so their products are not sold, so they have to close down - their share of the means of productions suddenly becomes smaller.
some years back i was mind-blown by [ivan illich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschooling_Society), and i always find [alfie kohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfie_Kohn) to be engaging as a speaker. you should take these with a grain of salt, however; my education on topics of education is rather lacking.
it is not clear, however, what you mean by the term 'costs of security'. it is relatively easy to imagine that the stockholders might be able to acquire protection from fallout-style rider bands, or from land-of-the-dead-style zombie hords. it is less straightforward to see what protection exists against a 'real' army. further, while it is evident that one might be able to secure their home, it is far less clear how they could protect access to resources. of course, one could propose ad hoc future technological developments to get out of these issues, but this is not a good way to argue.\n\non the public trust idea, i am not sure how you expect it to work. if the ruling class can 'usurp the tax collector', and if they have no active interst in any plan that benefits the masses, it is not clear why they would accept the existence of this trust. why not try to buy it out/dismantle it etc. of course, this can be made impossible by legislation, but then we are back at square one; we are proposing tougher regulation and state oversight,  in order to uphold the interests of the public, while at the same time, sweetening the deal with tax incentives. if we radicalise a little, we will become new deal democrats.

but who are these people who 'must realize' this? you say that the sign is a critique of a specific attitude, but it is unclear who has this attitude. and, is this not a trivial critique? feminism is a family of political positions, and some women are not persuaded by these political positions - then, unity along such positions is not possible, until they are persuaded to take up such positions. who was in danger of forgetting this?
Once you hang the "Open for Business" sign, you're extending an open invitation to your neighbors.  You've already done what you want with your property.  You can no longer threaten your neighbors for availing themselves of your invitation, until you take down said invitation.
If it was tactical (and the tactics didn't suck) it would work.  That said, there's a question of policy.  Does conceding to fascist policy encourage or discourage fascism?  Seems like it encourages fascism.\n\nDoes conceding to non-fascist policy espoused by fascists encourage or discourage fascism?  That's harder to say, as fascists are happy to adopt socialist policies and positions when it suits their pursuit of power.  Sort of like in the game "Secret Hitler", it's not enough to block fascist policy.  Another real danger is putting an outspoken fascist demagogue into a position of authority (see:  Trump, Donald).\n\nFolks who conflated Trump with every other candidate in the race helped feed into the notion that fascism was acceptable so long as the fascist was on the right side of some issues some of the time.

> It's not the rich people that end up going to planned parenthood for family planning.\n\nPlenty of rich people go to PP for family planning services.  The clinics are well-run, the doctors are professional, and the care is as good as you'll find anywhere.\n\nThe reason conservatives despise PP is because PP charges on a sliding scale rather than a flat rate.  Conservatives think it's unfair for a business to give equal access to rich and poor patrons alike.  They consider it disgraceful to wait in line behind someone less wealthy (or less white) than they are.\n\nThe attack on PP is an attack on an institution that is seen to serve a liberal population operating under liberal ideals.  Money will continue to go to conservative medical centers and conservative communities.  Only liberals are required to fund charity out of pocket.  Conservatives are allowed to ladle money out of the public trust for whatever social programs they consider vital.
> Just on a tactical level, I don’t see how this as a process can possibly work.\n\nRepublicans have a majority in House and Senate.  Their membership is notoriously pliable and dogmatically loyal to the party.  \n\nWe're seeing a bunch of noise about "full repeal", but that's easy enough to address.  Bundle a "full repeal" with a "sexy new replacement".  Just stick "Strike lines X thru Y from the legislative code" into the opening lines of the new Act.  Viola!  Everyone gets to vote on full repeal.\n\nThen everyone gets to lie to their base voters and blame the Democrats for being worse.  It's a time-tested method of Republican legislating that worked as well in 2001 as it will work in 2017.\n\n> What I’m saying is that if this works, then truly no one knows anything about governing.\n\nThe goal is to assuage the conservative voting base with red meat while feeding the conservative donor base with money.  That's the Republican formula for a winning coalition.  Governing is just about finding ways to make both of these groups happy long enough to win the next election cycle.

If you're a snake oil salesman, and I need to engage in significant investigating to figure out the oil in your bottle is a placebo, you've attempted to defraud me whether or not I hand you my money.  \n\nLibertarians have a hard time understanding the concept of risk-aversion costs.  If I need to pay money to avoid the risk of getting 'effed by your bullshit, I've been materially harmed whether or not the risks you created resolve.
> When the constitution was ratified the us military was practically non existent, almost entirely dependent on state militias.\n\nAnd it was something of a disaster.  Colonial powers continued to prey on US farmers and sailors (look up the English history of press-ganging).  Border disputes were chronic [and some even persist to this day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_disputed_by_Canada_and_the_United_States#Historical_disputes).  There was a real dispute over what constituted Indian Land and where those borders happened to be.\n\nAll this culminated in the War of 1812 under Madison.  That was the conflict in which D.C. was sacked and the White House was burned down.\n\nI don't know if that's our best model for US national security, not that the post-colonial Republic Era is in any way relateable to the modern American Corporate Imperial Era.
> No you're simply exercising property rights\n\nOwn four walls of a concrete box and you own the man inside it?  That's not a new idea, but it's hardly a liberty-minded one, either.\n\n> You're not a Government at that point, you're simply stating "Hey, you can travel here if you'd like if you pay me X Dollars for the privilege."\n\nGovernments do exactly this.  Their called tariffs and our current President is very fond of them.
> in an unequal world, immigration restrictions can't be eliminated without eliminating either democracy or the welfare state\n\nIf immigrants are a net positive to the economy - and most economists agree they are - then there's no need to curtail the welfare state.  On the contrary, welfare states grow more robust when they receive an influx of young, able-bodied workers.\n\nThe slam at "democracy" boils down to simple xenophobia.  What, exactly, are you afraid a bunch of migrant Latinos are going to do to Arizona, Texas, or SoCal that they haven't done already?\n\n> But it is an elementary logic mistake to imply that introducing an impoverished proletariat will increase technological progress!\n\nIt is not, however, a mistake to assume a technologically advanced society will be able to rapidly integrate an impoverished proletariat.  This is, after all, exactly what major metropolitan areas do on a regular basis.  Halting migration from Mexico to Texas makes about as much sense as halting migration from Detroit to Houston, and for all the same reasons.
> It's the concept of self ownership.\n\nIf you put a sign in the window that says "Cakes:  $10!" you've already agreed to trade labor for income.  When someone walks up, hands you $10, and says "Give me a cake", announcing that your self ownership has been mortally violated is so much empty drama.\n\nYou freely choose to associate with your neighbors, the day you hung the "Open for Business" sign in your window.  If you want to disassociate, close up shop.  That's the choice you're entitled to make.  After that point, you're no longer engaging in "voluntary association", you're engaging in fraud.
> So why should we be so in love with the democratic party again?\n\n17 Senators voted for him.\n\n31 Senators voted against him.\n\nTherefore, burn down the entire party?
These funds come up for a vote bi-annually.  Some Congressmen vote against it.  Most Congressmen vote for it.  I'd like to recognize those Congressmen doing the right thing - or at least moving in the direction of reform - rather than to throw up our hands and proclaim every elected rep in the last 15 years has been against us.
It's worth holding the previous to account for practices his DOJ failed to halt.  At the same time, it's worth mentioning that these practices aren't ending under the current administration.  If anything, they're likely getting worse.\n\nIf we want reform, we can't go into the debate blind to partisan bias.  Nor can we let current administrators justify bad policy by claiming "Whataboutism!" and deflecting blame for the roles they now play in perpetuating a shitty system.
> Now that he's in office, taking action, we can clearly see he's governing as a conservative.\n\nFor some definition of "conservative", I guess.  He's certainly not in favor of smaller government or state's rights.

It's the traditional end-run around anti-discrimination laws, and it's been an effective method of evading this kind of oversight for half a century.
> There is a LOT of "Conservative" charity work done on a sliding scale.\n\nNot in liberal communities.  Conservatives do charity work from within the church system and demand the right to make expressions of faith a requisite for reception of aid.\n\nAnd, if you're familiar with how church charities operate, they tend to distribute on a flat basis without respect to the incomes of the people they assist.
Markets hit new peaks under the Bush Administration, too.\n\nUntil they didn't.
Certainly, I know a few Republicans who think so.  "Liberal", "Socialist", "SJW!" all terms I've heard flung at Clinton-voters.
> Come off that high horse.\n\nYou first.\n\n> That's because governments are careful to only admit immigrants that are able to work.\n\nNo they aren't.  We have 11M undocumented residents in the US, and they've got a better unemployment rate than the documented residents.  That's half the reason you've got people complaining that they're losing their jobs.\n\n> But what's being proposed here is to abolish immigration restrictions. Which means all those that would not be a "net positive" get the right to relocate, and subsequently make claims on the welfare state.\n\nObject not in evidence.\n\nAgain, we already have 11M undocumented Americans.  [Even with all the legal barriers to employment, they have better worker rates than natives.](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/03/14/unemployment-for-illegals-may-be-lower-than-black-citizens-n1808866)\n\nThey already consume from the welfare state in sanctuary cities - driving on our roads, enrolling in our schools, and paying into/collecting from our SS/UI system.  Converting these 11M undocumented immigrants into naturalized citizens wouldn't have any impact on their productivity, except to make it easier for them to advance their careers and increase their productivity.

> Wow, right? Contacts with Russia, seemingly confirmed by multiple intelligence agencies. But wait it’s all according, ‘former American officials,’ in other words politicians from the Obama administration.\n\n...\n\n> In other words, everything so far has been found to be completely innocuous, just normal business dealings. The speciousness of the evidence did not dissuade the opposing political party in the White House from treating it like a serious threat. So serious in fact, that the former administration declassified and spread raw intelligence throughout multiple channels in an attempt to ‘preserve’ it.  This is nothing more than a political party using the power of the state to smear an incoming president. \n\nGood news, guys.  Foreign espionage isn't a problem.  Putin has no interest in influencing US foreign policies.  Everything is "completely innocuous".  And, if anyone who was serving in the bureaucracy during the Obama Administration says otherwise, it's a shameless smear campaign we should all close our eyes, shut our ears, and completely ignore.\n\n> Government officials violated the civil rights of Michael Flynn by illegally recording a phone conversation and then leaking the contents to reporters. There is no problem with insiders leaking to reporters. There is a major problem when the power of the state is illegally used to spy on a private individual and then leaked to the press for political purposes.\n\nI'll notify the Clinton Presidential Campaign.
A hard thing to confirm, given the limited information we have on his tax returns.
> this does not help McCaskill\n\nIndeed.  I don't think McCaskill should be the Attorney General.
Older people aren't de facto wealthier, they're just wealthier on average.  They're also a major GOP constituency.\n\nFrom a political perspective, taking money from younger, poorer, tanner constituents and giving it to older, richer, whiter constituents makes sense when those old rich white guys are voting for you.

Say Medicaid is bloated with fraud and nobody was receiving any benefit anyway.  Say the town halls full of angry residents are just paid actors, hired by the Soros Fund.  Say we can't give health care to people, because they'll spend it all on t-bone steaks and abortions.  Say privatization is the best way to fix everything, and if you don't benefit from privatization you're dumb.\n\nJust say anything, and hope people will believe you.\n\nI mean... it worked in 2010, 2014, and 2016.  Why not roll the dice one more time?
> not paying more in taxes than required\n\nThat bit was walked back a week later.  We still haven't seen his tax returns, because he is apparently under continuous audit.
No it doesn't.  Biding isn't open to the public and an oligopoly of state-friendly business interests dominate claims on the spectrum.
That's a subject of hot debate in the socialist community.

That's a compelling reason to favor contraception, which PP distributes in droves.  It's also a compelling reason to provide pre-natal care, another service PP provides.

It's just a matter of time before we find out.  The government leaks like a sponge.
For any purpose, sure.  For anyone, no.\n\nTo withdraw from an individual constitutes defraudment.  You made a business claim that you're refusing to fulfill.  If you don't want to fulfill the claim, don't make it.
It's certainly more egregious that way.  \n\nBut weddings are complicated affairs.  You put in an order for a cake in May, on the anticipation it will be delivered in August.  Even if the deposit is refunded, getting cancelled on creates a huge new burden for the wedding party that the couple has no responsibility for.\n\nAnd that's long after we get passed the simple principle that you said you sold cakes, and now you're saying you don't.  You're a business owner.  Do your fucking job and quit bitching.
> The perspective isn't from the "losers"; but from the population at large\n\n"Losers" is a bit of a loaded word.  But the communities highlighted in the books are consistently subject to political and social assault, and tend not to come out the other side triumphant in any conflict.\n\n> It's important that kids get exposed to this. The founders were deified in my early education; by high school we understood that while they had some good ideas, they were complicated men; that slavery was a very real blight on the land; that the poor whites were largely shut out of politics (Jackson representing a significant cultural shift), etc.\n\nAbsolutely.  I use the term "loser" more in juxtaposition to the old saying "History is written by the victors".  Zinn makes a very conscious effort to highlight the indigant, the poor, and the disenfranchised precisely because they so rarely get spotlighted in the history books.  As a consequence, he reveals a perspective on American history that is shameful and sordid.  This leads people in modern day political authority, who rely on positive national identity to maintain their authority, to fear Zinn's works as a threat to the foundations of their claim to power.

I-35 was designed in the 50s by a civil engineer lacking the foresight and skill to accommodate for explosive urban expansion sixty years later.\n\nPGBT was constructed in '98, through a city that had already undergone rapid expansion and increased density.\n\nI'd compare PGBT to Houston's Metro Redline, as the Red Line is the second most heavily used transit lane in the US, also costs $1.50 a ride, cost roughly the same amount in construction, was constructed at roughly the same time, and doesn't require you to own a car to enjoy.\n\nIf you're going to build billion-dollar transit projects in this state, the least you can do is build up a modern rail infrastructure.  Car culture, in Texas, has become a traffic nightmare that devours north of two hours a day and thousands of dollars a year for area residents.  It's what has made a farce of the "low cost of living" claim made by Texas developers and politicians.
> That's cronyism up and down.\n\nCrony capitalism is a chronic problem within the capitalist system.

This is how it goes:\n\n> The Difference Between Conservatives and Liberals\n\n> A Conservative and Liberal are walking down the street when they came to a homeless person. \n\n> The Conservative gave him his business card and told him to come to his business for a job.\n\n> He then took twenty dollars our of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person.\n\n> The Liberal was very impressed and when they came to another homeless person he decided to help.\n\n> He walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office.\n\nYou left out the part where the marine stood up, punched the atheist communist professor in the face, saving the American Flag before he was carried away by a flock of bald eagles.
Like the quote, it's more spin than substance.\n\n[Disputing studies exist](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2148033) and they generally find that partisanship has little impact on one's charitable inclinations.\n\nWhat's more [quite a bit of conservative charity is religious charity](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/America-s-Geographic-Giving/156259).  And, if you've seen some of the churches in wealthy, conservative neighborhoods, you might question whether donating $50,000 to a parish worth tens of millions constitutes a kind of charitable endeavor.\n\nThe dirty truth is that political inclination does not allow charity to substitute public works, whether the communities are red or blue.  In all cases, the charity received is dwarfed by the charitable needs of the local populace.  Conservatives simply cling to the "we're more charitable" myth, because they want to use a handful of private acts to justify the dismantling of social programs the working poor have already paid to receive.

> It's a chronic problem of Government having too much influence in people's lives\n\nEasements are necessary however you plan to organize your civil society.  Government is a release valve by which the public interacts, much as markets are.  And when you can deny people the ability to travel from point A to point B, you are a de facto government entity whether or not you are chartered as such.\n\n> Capitalism can exist outside of Government\n\nThe formal establishment of property ownership necessitates a third party capable of recognizing ownership.  You can play at capitalism without a governing institution, but the game fails at the first moment an irreconcilable dispute arises.\n\nAbsent a governing body to adjudicate disputes between property claimants, "capitalism" is little more than "might makes right".  The guy with the biggest army gets to say he's the regional proprietor and everyone else gets to pound sand.
I don't know.  [Let's ask Jeff Sessions what he thinks about lying to a Senate committee.](https://twitter.com/LemieuxLGM/status/837140709610295297/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHe seems pretty adamant that perjury is a serious offense, requiring forfeiture of office.

> Taxes could be anything ranging from conscripts to food to Leman Russ tanks.\n\nSure.  But then you're basically saying "Everything is fine, so long as you have an industrialized economy and your labor force is productive enough to shrug off the cost of tithing."  If you're not, the planet is basically a giant slave colony for the Empire.\n\nI'd say the tithe system entrenches corruption.  And the shitty treatment of locals tends to foment heresy.
I remember conservatives losing their ever-loving shit over the accusation that a Tea Party group was dodging taxes.  This became an "IRS scandal".\n\nThen there was the effort by the ATF to track how guns were crossing the US-Mexico border.  This was a direct attack on the NRA, and maybe a false flag or an insidious plot to trick people into thinking gun violence might be a problem.  I can't remember exactly what happened after that, but I know conservatives were horribly persecuted for it.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but Heinlein was kind of a perv.

And it's not just because Neil Patrick Harris was brilliant.
[Sure](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html)\n\n> Donald J. Trump explicitly acknowledged for the first time during Sunday’s debate that he used a $916 million loss that he reported on his 1995 income tax returns to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years.\n\n> Mr. Trump’s response — “Of course I do. Of course I do” — was the fullest the wealthy developer had provided since The New York Times reported that he had declared the loss, and that the tax deduction could have been large enough to allow him to avoid federal income taxes for up to 18 years.\n\n> Previously he had declined to comment on the documents, issuing a statement that neither challenged nor confirmed the $916 million loss.\n\n> Asked directly during the debate if he would say how many years he had avoided paying federal income taxes, Mr. Trump responded, “No.”\n\nHe later clarified\n\n> “I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, but, but as soon as my routine audit is finished I’ll release my returns,” he said. “I’ll be very proud to.”

> A novel argument, but not one that would likely apply to the referenced case.\n\nWe can get into the weeds about wedding cakes, but there's nothing about the couple's gayness that prevents the cake maker from producing the confection.  Might as well say they can't make cakes for Yankee's fans or The Unseasonably Tan.\n\n> Furthermore, the article states that the baker had sold ordinary cakes to the aggrieved party in the past.\n\nNot really an argument in favor of the baker, here.  They were clearly capable of delivering on the promised products, despite the clients being gay the entire time.  Only the foreknowledge of gaiety prevented the final sale.\n\nQuite clearly, the baker was reneging on an argument she had no problem fulfilling right up until the client's sexuality became public knowledge.  If "being gay" is grounds for contract termination, you've effectively denied gay individuals a right to own property entirely.
> It's not much of a stretch to say that the affluent are not McDonald's customers.\n\nIf the affluent are your customers, your customer base is very small.  A chain as big as McDonalds couldn't subsist entirely on the top 10%.  No more than Target or Microsoft could.\n\n> On top of that, businesses never expand because of shrinking costs. They expand because of increasing demand.\n\nDemand exists at different price points.  I might be willing to buy a sandwich at $7, but not at $10.  So, if you can produce sandwiches at a profit for $7, you can tap into my $7-sandwich-market.\n\nSimilarly, if you're a relatively small firm, you need to finance expansion.  If you can borrow $10M and it costs you $7M to build a new storefront today, but $5M to build a new storefront tomorrow, that means tomorrow you can expand farther with every new influx of investment cash than today.

> a single-nation world is such a foreign concept right now that we can only speak in hypotheticals\n\nWe've already proven a federalist/confederate system to be reasonably functional.  Most nations operate under a collection of sub-states and municipalities.  Few people complain that New York and California can't coexist within the same national political body, or that Osaka and Sendai are so removed that they cannot subsist as a unified nation.\n\nIf anything, British Imperialism - a system that persisted for centuries - suggests a united global governmental body is not only workable but desirable.  The benefits of international trade and transit stemming from a British Imperial System enriched all the major elements of the empire.
> he didn't have a problem with selling cakes to a gay person, he only wanted to express his protest against gay marriage\n\nYeah.  I got that.  The problem is that this person isn't running a political action committee, she's running a bakery.  If she wants to hang a giant banner from the side of her building saying, "I disapprove of gay marriage" more power to her.  But if someone comes in to buy a cake, she's obligated to take the money in exchange for the cake per the stated terms listed on her merchandising materials.\n\n> the same way I have the right to boycott his shop\n\nIf you put forward an opening bidding process and say, "I'll buy the cake provided by the lowest bidder who can meet my specifications," and the bakery is the lowest bid, rejecting the bid because the baker is an Evangelical Christian would put you at risk of the same liability as were the bakery to reject an order from a gay man.\n\nCourts would not be able to nullify the open contract you put forward simply because the baker had beliefs you didn't agree with.

> Being as roads are funded by consumption taxes via gas tax, we aren't that worried about it in comparison\n\nTwo points.  Firstly, highway funding is regularly supplemented out of the general trust from state and federal treasuries.  Sales, property, and income taxes go toward roadways.  This isn't unreasonable on its face, because incomes are derived through commerce and commerce requires roads.  A higher level of income suggests one is making heavier use of commerce at least indirectly.  Same with sales and property taxes.\n\nSecondly, there is literally a sub called /r/whowillbuildtheroads, where anti-tax advocates go totally bananas over anyone who dares to suggest public transit represents a state service that adds value to the economy.  /r/Shitstatistssay is another forum that loves to go ape-shit at anyone who advocates the utility of publicly managed easements.\n\nI live in Texas.  We sidled towards the private roadway model.  It's been a fucking travesty and everyone hates it, except the lobbyists and the state legislators padding their wallets.\n\n> That all being said, given automation and scanning technology, why can't private roads be paid for in a more streamlined way, likely with cheaper and better managed roads?\n\nBecause automation and scanning still takes money to implement.  And the actual administration of the roadways doesn't save the end user any money.  Yeah, you could do it.  The EZ Tag system still sucks.\n\n> TL;DR I don't think you actually understand the "muh roads" joke.\n\nIt's a tired, oft-ill-employed, painfully-smug joke to begin with.  This particular iteration was worse than usual.

It would price many of these abortion services outside what poorer women could afford and drastically reduce the rate at which they were performed.\n\nWere PP to cater exclusively to wealthier families, as many private hospitals and clinics providing abortions do, I think the objection to the organization would evaporate.

Let's call things as they are.\n\nHe didn't just "fail to halt" the process, he campaigned on toughening up enforcement and embracing still-more-draconian immigration policy.  Trump is cultivating a consensus in the GOP that this kind of treatment is acceptable.  He voided benefit-of-the-doubt way back during the primary.\n\n> That aside, I think this underscores the need to rid ourselves of privately-run prisons.\n\nThat's a step Obama took towards, and one Trump immediately rolled back.  If we're giving credit where credit's due, Trump's proven where he stands in little over a month.

While Issa has often emphasized that he believes the IRS exclusively targeted Tea Party groups "because of their political beliefs," that argument relies heavily on the fact that the latest version of the so-called BOLO lists primarily contained conservative-sounding groups. In fact, the IRS also kept and circulated historical versions of that list for continued scrutiny, which were filled with progressive keywords, including medical marijuana groups and keywords designed to flag groups descended from the now-defunct ACORN.\n\n

He's a professor and author most famous for compiling [A People's History of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People's_History_of_the_United_States), a book which sought to break from tradition and tell the story of America from the perspective of the losers - American Natives, poor white colonists, black slaves, immigrants during the industrial revolution, political opponents of the US involvement in world wars, etc.\n\nBecause he paints traditionally-lionized heroes - half a chapter is spent exposing Columbus's horrible history, I don't think he speaks favorably of a single US President, from Washington to Clinton - as scoundrels, despots, and demagogues, the book has a reputation for inspiring the kind of counter-culture and rebellion in teenage youths that nationalist school administrators dread.  The fact that the book got banned suggests students might have been passing around copies and developing opinions not sanctioned by the more conservative elements of the community.
Quite a few people in the Midwest didn't vote for Trump.

He point-blank denied the claim of any interaction.\n\nSort of like being asked, "Did you stab your wife" and replying "No!  Never!"  Then coming back a week later and saying, "Well yes, but only in self-defense, which is totally legal and you never asked if the stabbing was in self-defense so obviously that doesn't count."

> It's not liberalism that disturbs me, it's dogmatic liberalism\n\nA distinction without much of a difference, when you work from the premise that someone holding to a liberal belief is in the wrong.  Proclaiming someone else's beliefs "absurd" requires a certain degree of dogmatic intractability, itself.\n\n> What makes me think "cult" is when people adhere to a belief system with a degree of rigidity that is not warranted by the belief system's likelihood of being an accurate representation of reality\n\nPeople tend to cling most firmly to beliefs they hold *do accurately represent reality*.  Particularly if they believe they are being bombarded with false information.  That's the nature of the trust-game that is politics.  Once you establish the real possibility that a rival ideologue is lying, it is irrational to approach evidence the rival presents without extreme skepticism.\n\n> behavior that is actually driven by emotional rather than rational factors\n\nFact and emotion are not disjointed.  Certainty tends to bring on strong emotional responses.\n\nIf you believe your spouse *might* be cheating on you, you'll behave more dispassionately than if you believe your spouse *definitely* is cheating on you.  Similarly, if you can't find your child and suspect he's vanished, you're less likely to panic in the same manner as you would if you witnessed your child being kidnapped.\n\nDenouncing someone as "overly emotional" because you don't feel convinced isn't an illustration of logos over pathos.  It's an expression of cynicism in the face of resolve.
Border security and defense spending and police protections are different, though.  We all need to pay taxes for that, because the Constitution explicitly mandates it.
It does, if you're going to put forward a reliable forecast differentiating the status quo from future projected policies.\n\nLooser regulations, in particular, tend to result in more waste, fraud, and malinvestment that's absorbed by a firm's neighbors while allowing businesses to forego engineers and accountants necessary to prevent waste from occurring.  That's generally bad news for long-term economic growth.
> Is a customer mortally wounded if they can't get exactly what they want?\n\nIf you put something on your menu that you're not serving it up, you're engaging in fraud.  That kind of bait-and-switch costs people time and money.  Don't want to sell cake?  Don't put cake on your menu.  It's not hard.\n\n> Why does freedom of association magically end if you have a business?\n\nWhy does running a business infringe on your freedom of association?  You make an offer.  Someone accepts.  How is your freedom infringed?\n\nFolks want to pretend as though being gay is some kind of breach of contract, but *denying your clients what you've promised to provide isn't*.  That's a bizarre view regarding how a business can legally operate.
I don't know about baseless.  If you're Saudi-phobic, and you genuinely object to any politician accepting any money from any Saudi resident, this story should concern you.\n\nBut it's clearly targeted at McCain because McCain is critical of Trump.  If we were to create a laundry list of politicians accepting money from Saudi-"tainted" sources, [there are a few other politicians you could put on the list](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-donald-trump-made-millions-saudi-government-article-1.2777211)\n\n> I dont like McCain, but youre going to be hardpressed to paint him as corrupted.\n\nMcCain's corrupt as sin.  He's dick deep in the country's military industrial complex, and the Saudis just happen to be one of the nation's biggest buyers of military surplus.  He's just not noticeably worse than half his Senate compatriots - from Chuck Schumer to Rand Paul - making this case of scandal less a McCain problem than an Out-of-Control Defense Contractor Lobbying problem.
> Do you have anything to support this claim?\n\nMath?  It's the  only way you conclude "a few people" are doing the majority of work in an economy of 189M workers.\n\n> No offense, but I'm going to go with the professionals\n\nYou've cited a blob of text that indicates analysis took place.  Case in point:\n\n>> The power law distribution (also called a Paretian Distribution) shows that there are many levels of high performance, and the population of people below the "hyper performers" is distributed among "near hyper-performers" all the way down to "low performers."\n\nIt's a pure relativistic metric wherein he's claiming you can select any group and lump some number into the "hyperperformer" basket.  You're still not establishing what constitutes "performance" between individuals, much less how you can evaluate across disciplines (if you have an accountant, a salesman, and an engineer, which of the three is the "hyperperformer" relative to the other two?)\n\nVague hand-wavey linear graphs do not a "scientific model" make.  I mean, the y-axis on these graphs, alone...
RSS members have been violently attacking CPI(M) activists in Kerala recently, they've been posting some pretty graphic images on their twitter @cpimspeak. The scary thing is that this group that's machete-ing activists and telling its members to kill CPI(M) politicians is formally associated with India's governing party, BJP.
