nd the expansion cycle and keep you grinding while they work on the next expansion. With the content already on your plate, it's not as necessary to extend gameplay in exchange for an increasingly diminishing benefit for increasingly inflated costs, at the same time fighting mobs that are tuned assuming you have max aas for the prior expansion cycle.
Lots of people went to Penn State and played football, are they all pedos now?
All scenes with Chewie sitting are still Peter Mayhew, as I understand it. /u/PeterMayhew can probably clear that up for us.
Was 09 the one on Christmas Day that had a very solid line where it stopped just south of Hot Springs? I had went up to see my aunt in Hot Springs Village and left the minute I heard the first ice starting to hit. By the time I was going up the hill where Planet Fitness is in Hot Springs, I was driving on ice pellets, could hear them under the tires. By the time I got to Jack Mountain just before Bismarck, the ice had stopped and it was just raining. When I made it back to Arkadelphia, the sun was out.
As everyone else said, if you've only been reading DC you're more or less exempt from the Image mess. At one point, Marvel was so creatively bankrupt that they licensed all of the Avengers properties and the Fantastic Four out to Image to produce. They were so focused on milking the X-Men cash cow that they had no time for their key characters or bothering to put creative teams together for them.
What do you mean? Half this sub laps up any shit the Trump White House sells them without questioning it.
Catering to target audience, good songwriting and mass appeal. I'm not the target audience, but TBP is one of my top 10 all timers.
Original version of Zack Ryder's "Oh Radio" too. The remake he's using now is gar-bage though.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ0N6PUHTnE\n\nMake it a three pack and toss in Edge's "Metalingus" - the Alter Bridge one, not the re-record.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj5ot7zq1wk
Maybe he had an IMDB page because he lived in a part of North Carolina that has a lot of film shoots, including Iron Man 3? I'm just here to try to apply Occam's Razor to you guys, and I notice you don't like it.
Just pointing out that whenever law enforcement has pushes against trafficking, they always artificially inflate numbers by busting johns and sex workers.
Not completely related, but there's a family member of a friend who passed away last week, and his wife is still posting from his Facebook account. It's disconcerting to say the least.
Being themselves on deceased and their own profiles, sometimes on the same comment thread. 
It's actually being ran by all four Citadel Council races, so there has to be some degree of input from the Alliance on the humanity end.
What if it's *not* real though? You're all starting with the premise that it is and working the "evidence" to reach that conclusion and not going the proper way.
Don't forget the part where they decided to build a line around Ghost Rider by moving their more boring supernatural heroes into the same imprint. Marvel was bad about that in the 90s too.
Lot of rule 10 up in here.
Occam's razor isn't a strawman at all, although I would see why someone who has expressed white supremacist views and only posts in altright themed subs other than here would want to discredit it.
Where dem arrests at, OP?
High profile arrests are coming in the next 24 hours though!
Just a note about human trafficking. Yes, the charge itself sounds horrible, but it's not always that. Being busted for running an escort agency, where all the escorts are willing, adult employees will get you a human trafficking charge. I think with the explosion of half-informed Pizzagate posts regarding it, we've let it become a little more of something than it may actually be.
Whole face, no goofy camera angle, def not Morgan.
Isn't believing anything FBIanon says considering him credible though? Your implication in the OP is that the biggest LARP site in the world can ever be trusted - which it can't.
/pol/ isn't a board like /r/politics, like the name implies. In case you don't go to 4chan, /pol/ is more their version of /r/the_donald or /r/altright. There's an interest in not looking into any possible ties to Republicans, which is why you don't see much of the DynCorp theories.
That's still completely out of left field with no support though.
Note that despite the fact that it's great, despite the other person's comment, MGS3 is not a rpg of any sort. If you're into the Baldur's style, Champions of Norrath and Champions: Return to Arms are both great. Of course, Persona 3 and 4
The arrest alluded to has never happened.
How is Sandusky connected to Comet Pizza or John Podesta?
I tried to explain to the page owner once about how everyone hates uncloseable popovers like that Holcomb ad, he didn't follow.
You think so? Every time I see a discussion, any connections to Republicans like Trump's associations with Epstein and DynCorp are dismissed or flat out ignored, and the focus is promptly back on Podesta and Comet Ping Pong. All I see are conspiracy outlets becoming the lapdogs of the people they claim to oppose because Trump has the appearance of being an outsider.
Waiting for Steve to turn his paperwork in so I can send the weekly P&L into corporate. Spoiler, Steve is off today, so right now I'm just dicking around until another manager shows up so I can leave.
Oh give it up, it's just 4chan larpers. 
Marvel didn't really know it. Iron Man was a huge risk for Marvel, that's been largely forgotten. Iron Man failing would have probably ended up with Marvel being sold to Warner.
This is the seventh or eighth time that arrests have been imminent. How many times does the boy have to cry wolf for the Pizzagaters before they start thinking for themselves?
Hot Springs drivers are some of the worst, and that intersection was on Jalopnik as one of the worst in the United States at one point.
The company that was cited was originally created on /x/ - take that as you will.
You really shouldn't buy anything from shard shop other than gear and Vader.
The english bulldog needs to be his tag team partner.
For Pizzagate to be real, FBIanon has to be credible, since so many of the dangling threads depend on his information. If just one thing in the Jenga tower that is Pizzagate is considered to not be credible, the whole thing collapses.
*rolls eyes* I don't think the word evidence means what you think it does.
He's also from a part of North Carolina where Iron Man 3 and several other big budget movies were filmed, and lots of smaller ones are as well. I'd be more suspicious of him not having one.
He's also a former Democratic politician, so all of his stuff leans left too.
Maybe an actual arrest or accusation that doesn't depend on a bunch of kids playing on the internet? That would go a long fucking way.
Horrible idea, bigly. Neocons are pretty much solely responsible for every foreign policy problem we have now.
...which was better than the Metallica original.
Like where the secret kid molestation room is, because he's there all the time?
Ah, this picture. The scene calls to mind a naive young bimbo of a model, agreeing to meet a photographer in a local hotel room to take some shots. He's got you to hike your skirt up to show off your panties now, after an offer of alcohol or a couple of lines, he's going to eventually coax you to take the dress off, then the panties. Once those are off, he'll let the ten guys of various ethnic backgrounds in from the next room to move to the next phase of the shoot.
Pretty much, especially around here.
I've had a couple lately though, especially on node 11 with insane speed mods/droids with JE. Retreat asap.
Parts of the theory that depend on FBIanon's story don't work if he's not credible. If he's not credible, parts of the theory that only stand up based on those parts that depend on FBIanons's story collapse. It's like WTC, controlled demolition, man.
Escort agency busts are also counted as trafficking arrests, fwiw. The girls working are charged with solicitation, the owner is charged with trafficking, even if everyone involved is a consenting adult. Each girl working for the agency is a separate trafficking charge, and if they employ drivers, for each of them as well.
I imagine it's more an adaptation of the Broadway show and less the movie.
Let me guess, arrests are coming in the next 24 hours?
If you live somewhere where a lot of people get work as extras, I'd be more inclined to look at people who don't have IMDB, especially if they were actively looking for work in future productions, wouldn't you? It's like Linkedin for actors. I apply more scrutiny to people applying with me if they don't have any social media.
I see you brought up Epstein. Let's recall this interview with Epstein from 2010, from Vice News. Talk about connections...\n\n>Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?\n\n>A. What do you mean by "personal relationship," sir?\n\n>Q. Have you socialized with him?\n\n>A. Yes, sir.\n\n>Q. Yes?\n\n>A. Yes, sir.\n\n>Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?\n\n>A: Though I'd like to answer that question, at least today I'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.\n\nWhy is there never any concern about this? *hint: it's because it's T_D pushing this to keep the conspiracy crowd busy from what their president is doing*
Probably, but they fire about half the deputies every time the sheriff changes because they have their job based on politics. Getting fired from GCSO doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong.
Once, in /v/. The leak detailing the Arkham Knight season pass contents were accurate, but were grossly oversold.
Busting prostitutes, pimps and escort agencies isn't anything Pizzagate related, no matter how much you want it to be. Connect just one of them to Podesta, Alefantis or Comet Pizza. You can't.\n\nGoing to repeat this again: Escort agency busts are counted as trafficking arrests. The girls working are charged with solicitation, the owner is charged with trafficking, even if everyone involved is a consenting adult. Each girl working for the agency is a separate trafficking charge, and if they employ drivers, for each of them as well. Trafficking sounds horrible, yes. Legally, it may not always be as much a big of a deal as you desperately want it to be.
Oh, I know, but I still consider them the more important Marvel franchises because they and Spiderman were the big books back in the 60s and early 70s during Marvel's expansion. You're absolutely right that they were in a period of mass neglect at that point though.
It's all gaslighting. People here aren't challenging it because they think Trump is some sort of anti-authority messiah.\n
Please don't, his links don't hold up to scrutiny.
> Who is saying that there have been arrests related to Podesta? No one. I'm not even really sure what your argument is. No one has been arrested? Yeah no shit.\n\nThere have been promised of high level arrests related directly to Pizzagate numerous times, and yet, none of the people connected to the theory are ever arrested. Imagine that. If there's going to be a high level Pizzagate arrest, there should at least be someone related to the central conceit of the theory and not some escort agency bust in Memphis, no?
Let's take a moment to remember that Dwayne McDuffie hated the "where's my money, honey" confrontation between Luke Cage and Doctor Doom so much that he tried to retcon it for years, even though his retcon didn't make sense in context of the story. It's canon now that it was the real Doom.
I kept getting sidetracked, there was just too much to do.
That's pretty much exactly what he is. He used to work for the GCSO.
Start the investigation, look at the evidence you have. Find what you can prove without making assumptions or leaps of logic, then go off only parts of it that you can prove. If you can't prove it - or at least come up with an angle to further investigate that, discount that completely. Only after examining everything and acting only with what you can prove, come up with the conclusion that it does or does not exist. Everyone investigating Pizzagate has started with the conclusion that it's real, and it shaping the narrative to support that conclusion, no matter how poor the evidence actually is.
The pre-release material directly from Bioware says it's a project of the four Citadel Council races, so that means humans, salarians, asari and turians, unless you want to argue that there's a fourth secret Council race that we don't know of, I'm not sure where you're going with your point.
Do they suggest that, or does someone else suggest that and you work your way to that conclusion without considering alternatives?
Have you? Here, I'll answer for both of us. No.
It's not even comforting messages with the one in question, it's carrying on conversations.
K9 handler.
This is why people don't take anything seriously related to it. When you're confronted with something concrete like this, Pizzagate fanbois start trying to squirm out of it.
Let me put it this way, and this is totally hypothetical. I'm going to decide you're a pedophile. Now, I'm going to go on your social media and see that you're a summer camp counselor and have pictures on your instagram of you with shirtless kids. That's evidence that you're a pedo, based on my conclusion. Say you have an infant child. There's a picture of you giving them a bath in the sink. Even more evidence, and you may be eating babies, since they're in the kitchen sink. What kind of madman are you?
This is concrete: there has been no arrest related to Podesta, Comet Ping Pong or any of the central cruxes of the theory other than the nut who tried to shoot up the place. Do you deny that? \n\n>There is no evidence that Seaman's information was intentionally wrong.\n\nThat's trying to squirm out of it.
Stan's comics still read well though, years later. Marvel's focus on "in the moment" politics may make it buzz-worthy now, but how is this going to read in 20 years, distanced from the "Obama's not my president" comparison of Sam to President Obama in Captain America: Sam Wilson #1?
Shifting to Sith now. It's still got issues with mods.
Is that the room that had the bull poster over the bed in that one video, Jenny?
Neither do conservatives. When Mike Huckabee was Arkansas governor, he pandered to illegals. Now he's tough on them.
Too bad TFP is the only one who can survive an opening AE.
Oh, just making the point that two can play at that game. Although, Pizzagate is one of those altright-style tactics. You've got this vague conspiracy that no one is quite sure exactly is about, and you can expand it at will to apply it to any person or situation that you need to discredit.
>Do you have any examples of people creating disinformation?\n\n"Arrests are coming in the next 24 hours."\n\nThere has *never* been a single arrest connected to Podesta or Comet Pizza other than the conspiracy nut who decided to try to shoot up the place.
Reagan was friends with Hastert too, that doesn't make him a pedo. Like I've tried to point out over and over, coincidences don't make things so.
I don't think you know what widespread in the question I was responding to means. Two instances =/= widespread.
They're coming in the next 24 hours, maaan.
This is canon in the recent The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy young adult novel. Shut the thread down, we're done here.
Better hurry, since that's in 14 days.
Some people are trying to claim Seaman was talking about the Sandusky arrest now.\n\nSAD.
I don't think you understand what accused means. When it comes out of your mouth on video, you can't be accused of saying something.
The general public didn't know Anakin was Vader until decades after Endor in the new canon, so the question is when did the supreme leader know it?
They actually got in trouble during Pizzagate for sharing pictures of little kids.  They might have been the real pedos all along.
Man, I had already forgotten about Sewer Rat Barbie.  Is she still employed?
Her claim to fame was literally sucking Ray J's dick.
Not to mention having an uncle that has been successful in the music business since the 1960s.
Let's not put any ideas in Adolf's head.
So you're saying the same thing he's saying, but in an oddly combative way.
Most of the cases of actual voter fraud found were Trump voters voting illegally.\n\nhttp://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/iowa-woman-arrested-after-voting-for-trump-twice.html\n\nhttps://news.vice.com/story/trump-supporters-keep-committing-voter-fraud\n\nhttp://thetelegraph.com/news/91835/woman-admits-voting-for-late-husband-says-she-knew-he-wanted-to-vote-trump\n\nhttp://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/10/28/trump-supporter-arrested-accused-of-voting-twice-in-des-moines/
MONSTER MASH
Choosing V for Vendetta over 1984 really points out your own terrible taste more than anything.
Is the size of the brain not a structural difference in itself?  I just took it as them showing a physical difference as being more concrete evidence.
Eh, I've been into cyberpunk since the 90s - the books, the games, the anime, even the shitty B-movies and I'd say this easily qualifies.  You seem to forget that even writers like William Gibson were heavily consumed by the aesthetic nearly as much as the "sci Fi" elements (which in the 80s could be qualified with not much more than a simple computer hacking story by Bruce Sterling.)
If you're a capitalist you buy it and sell it for as much as you can get.  If you're a socialist you buy it and sell it at cost to a friend, or even donate it to a poor family or orphanage, etc.  At the end of the day it's your life and nobody else's business what you do with it.
Yeah that would suck.  We go to the movies a few times a month and I haven't seen somebody with their phone out in years.
> Given the voting turnout, I'd say a large portion of the public is also pretty apathetic/don't give a shit.\n\nThe voting turnout *before the Trump presidency.*  A few people have mobilized since then.  The key thing now is to prepare for 2018.
They took a pre-existing script and just added the "Lawnmower Man" bit to it so they could slap Stephen King's name on for a better marketing angle.  The original title of the movie was "Cyber God".
Yeah they'll have to wait 20 years and make a TV movie out of it.
These were commemorative sets, the ones Michael Collins donated had added importance because he personally owned them.  These pop up from time to time on ebay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/SCARCE-APOLLO-ii-COMMAND-MODULE-MOON-LANDING-CUFFLINKS-/192098632682\n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Apollo-11-Commemorative-Tie-Tack-Tie-Bar-and-Cuff-link-set-/172511405723\n\n
They were also getting older and mellower, Anthony and Flea were closing in on 30 when they made that album.
Only problem is hardcore players would have the map memorized and new players might be turned off by not knowing where to go.
Glad they dodged that bullet, that script sounded like a dare to write the worst F13 movie ever.
And Andrew Dice Clay's "Ohhhh" and "Unbelievable!" which were sampled for [Unbelievable by EMF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKYcgMU-nJQ).
What's the point of freedom if everybody who wants a pony can't get one?
Hard to tell if this is satire or unintentional comedy.
I'd be more worried about China than Russia at this point.  Russia is struggling to retain some relevance as they collapse under the weight of cheap oil.  China is a far more serious threat, yet one Trump has been intent on trash talking.
Does Disneyland have special days where they don't allow kids?  That would be awesome.
China has already started improving their air quality, I think that has little to do with Trump though.
When all else fails the ad hominem attacks start.  From your post history you don't exactly look very unbiased either.
TFW you realize Trump is both evil and a pedo.
Well Milo does claim it's okay to sleep with 14 year olds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJhHwspZGcg
I see him as trying to do both.  He wants to shut down media that fact checks his ridiculous claims while replacing them with his preferred propaganda bureau.  If he gets his way PBS and NPR will become things of the past and CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS will be heavily censored.
Nintendo's worth around $30-40 billion, that'd be one hell of a lottery win.
If he was truly being sarcastic then he fucked up in a huge way.  Child rape is one topic most normal people don't find very funny.  But here you are defending pedophilia, so I have to assume you're a pedo yourself.  
Retro style, like Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.  Fuck backstories and all that bullshit, just some horny teens getting it on at the campground before they're murdered.
I read the book and saw the 1984 movie from the '80s soon after and thought it was quite good, it certainly captured the bleak tone very well.  The V for Vendetta movie, on the other hand, I found a bit goofy.
Key phrase being "could be up to".  My income this year "could be up to" a trillion dollars, in reality it will likely be far less than that though.\n\n

Please download and install Spyro.exe, you will then be given instructions on how to send Nintendo moneys.
Obama wouldn't approve the raid because it was too risky.  Trump didn't see the problem with putting other people's lives at serious risk and ordered them to go ahead with it.
And probably a Merkin at that.
From what I've seen of the conspiracy theorist scene (not just on reddit but elsewhere on the internet, youtube, as well as radio talk shows, books, etc.) they seem to skew Right Wing for whatever reason.\n\nThey even try to co-opt liberal conspiracy theories or related media.  Like the movie "They Live", which John Carpenter openly stated was his critique of Reaganomics and the conservative elite who pushed trickle down theories, yet the imdb message boards for that movie were overrun with anti-semitic rants about how the movie proved that the Jews and evil liberals were trying to take over the world.  And now that imdb shut down its boards they're doing the same thing in youtube comment sections: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORrasstzfEY
Tried going for Repo Man (1984) a few times, but it froze up or errored out before ever guessing the movie.
> Not everybody wants that\n\nWhen the "that" is actual facts, I see little point in continuing such conversation.  Might as well just talk about the weather, football, the Kardashians, or some other superficial fluff instead, it's not like the conversation is going to be enlightening either way.  
From what I've seen the Edge controllers appear to be the best of the 3rd party.  The ones you'd get on ebay for $2 are going to be the cheapest generic crap from China.
> but the only reason they are unavailable on the store shelves is because all the scalpers line up at 3am to buy them first. artificial scarcity created by scalpers, who then profit off that scarcity. that's called a monopoly. like de beers diamonds in south africa.\n\nThat has nothing to do with a monopoly, it's all still just capitalism functioning like it's supposed to - basic supply and demand, the more demand and less supply something has the higher its value increases.
It's going to be up to the lag of the hdtv sadly, and even good hdtv's can sometimes have bad lag (they're usually worried more about great visuals than latency.)  I would definitely recommend using hakchi and at least turning off the epilepsy filter though, you could also load in the original Mike Tyson rom while you're at it.
Those are all 3rd party sellers, not amazon.  They're just using amazon as a marketplace, like ebay.
This has been covered thoroughly and the developers have already responded that gameplay tests where the music was down cut down turned out poorly.
Sony also had notoriously bad security though.
Mobile net cafe and/or meth lab?
Welcome home Brother!
But there's nothing to be gained from such a conversation, so why have it at all?  It's like trying to figure out the proper way to discuss existentialism with a 3 year old, when you should probably just be talking about toys and cartoons with them instead.  Save yourselves both the headache and just change the subject.
You thought Breath of the Wild was big, then Dragon Quest Heroes walks into the room like Mandingo.
Thank goodness website polls can never be brigaded or anything, and it's not like Fox viewers skew right-wing either, right/
Too late.
Please tell me you grabbed that at a Gamestop and ran out the mall with it.
You save the pussy grabbing for women that *aren't* your wife.
I've bought reserved seats at the theater right before walking into the show.  One thing it does show you is exactly what seats are available, so if you have to sit in the front row or something you can just wait for the next viewing (big blockbusters usually have a viewing every 30 minutes anyway.)
Russia did far more than hack the DNC to influence the 2016 elections, it would be disingenuous to leave it at that - basically a strawman Trump supporters would use to downplay the importance of all this.  If you want to spell it all out it doesn't make for a very concise headline though: "Russians hacked into DNC email and colluded with Trump administration as well as paid online shills and fake news sites to spread anti-Hillary propaganda as an attempt to sway 2016 election", etc..
The Wii launched at 249.99, though that would be about $300 with inflation.
The pill poppers affect me with their delusional voting.  This is just my personal belief based on anecdotal evidence though, all the pill poppers around me are huge Trump supporters but couldn't even tell you who Michael Flynn is.  They seem to live in a separate reality created by their drug addled state; are strongly emotional about their beliefs but show no desire to research the facts behind them.
Oh right, another "liberal" that posts constantly on The_Donald and defends his lackies.  Fuck off pedo.
I thought the Smash DLC was good, just a little pricey if you wanted to buy all the characters.  In reality there were only 1 or 2 characters I wanted though so it wasn't that bad.
I think preorders lasted for like a week after they went live, for the gray system.  They also sporadically had the Neon version during that time, I was able to snag one like 2-3 days after preorders started when Neon was briefly available again.
I noticed through Cinemark at least if you pay by gift card you aren't charged any fees for reserving seats online.
They wouldn't have too much to lose by putting a kiddie sex dungeon in the basement of a popular pizza place?  I don't understand how this even passed anybody's sniff test.  It was like a cult initiation test, anybody who believes that shit could probably be persuaded to donate their life's savings to Xenu.
Lazy programming has nothing to do with the Turing Test, and I've yet to see a chatbot that actually passes the Turing Test.  (Well I guess there is one that has supposedly passed it, though it only fooled 1 out of 3 judges: http://io9.gizmodo.com/a-chatbot-has-passed-the-turing-test-for-the-first-ti-1587834715)\n\nThe Turing Test just promotes better AI, the way you achieve better AI is up to the programmers.  The things you complain about are faults of the programmers, not the test.
I always thought Angela Bassett was born to play Storm.  I was shocked when they cast Halle as she didn't seem to embody Storm in pretty much any way, and after all those movies still doesn't.

"Trump wants to end therapy for vets to pay for his vacations" should be a pretty good soundbite.
I'd say Samsung and SanDisk sd cards are pretty much on the same level.
Can confirm, girlfriend wanted to see the recent Underworld movie, it was a struggle trying to stay awake in the recliner with a movie that boring.
Reminds me of Blade Runner where most of the animals have been replaced with mechanical versions.
A 20 seat theater almost seems *too* intimate.  I've literally seen home theaters that size, though it was a CEO of a movie chain.
I'd doubt the social media team would be the same ones handling localization.
how is polling an 'echo chamber'? What is the 'chamber' and what is 'echoing' within it? 
Live in Dallas with a few million people, haven't seen it happen since like the late 2000s when smartphone etiquette was a little looser.
I don't think even the T_Ders are deluded enough to think that sub is  remotely unbiased.  Trump could fuck their wives right in front of them and they'd keep on their Special Olympics level mental gymnastics to rationalize that as a good thing.
That was a small part of it, the conspiracy theories involved underground sex dungeons run by a ring of Satanic pedophile politicians, Obama playing ping pong with child victims at the very pizza parlor he raped them at, international kidnappings, etc, etc.
Considering his role in hyping up Pizzagate it seems like poetic justice.  Milo has never been of very honorable character to begin with.
Seemed more like an opinion tbh.
Zelda and Dragon Quest are so far the biggest games though, a lot of the others are only around 3-5 GB.
Pretty sure it's just a side quest.
*Psst, tell them about the improved cyber!*
"All of a sudden" is more common, but there's really nothing grammatically wrong with the "all of the sudden" variant. 
I'm not the biggest Zelda fan, it's the only launch game that appeals to me due to the open world and art style, but the dungeon crawling not so much.  Basically just want something to play until Mario Kart, Splatoon, New Donk City and Smash Bros come out and I already sold my 3DS.
Now I'm tempted to register BreastsOfTheWild
Over 120,000 civilians were killed during Bush Jr's Iraq War, and the sanctions were put in place by Bush Sr. starting in 1990.
Have you actually read the details of Pizzagate though?  It's not the idea of committing crimes that's far fetched, it's doing so in such a gregarious and outlandish manner.

This has been happening in my area for a couple of weeks now, brickseek doesn't seem very reliable anymore.
But he was obviously just being sarcastic. /s
Why is it that people have to intentionally skew the details when they call PG baseless? If it's unreasonable, you should be able to recite the true detail and let it speak for its self. Like why didn't you say "just because tony podesta was decades long friends with the most powerful serial child molestor to ever rise through the D.C. Power structure and emails sent at the time of his indictment suggest he already knew about his sex crimes", is that what you mean to say?
Is it an explanation? Is it context? Why is Milo even famous? Because he says trannies are pigs?
the "compliant and unaware" email changed my life, to think that's how the ruling class refers to me and my community when they don't think the camera is on. No wonder we are clueless about everything except for things we know we hate.\n\nI also read the snopes page on this email and stared out the window for 10 minutes. it is so clear what he is saying, and it is so clear people want me to think it's something else.
that is not correct. It's an email between HRC staffers lamenting trumps advantage as an "entertainer". Bill Ivey is speaking from the perspective of team HRC, clearly. He's saying after the conventions he is worried trump will still do well vs HRC. "Unawareness is still strong" but compliance is fading. I.e. People are still dumb but they aren't listening to us when we tell them trump is unfit to serve. Why would he switch perspectives from team HRC to team government midway through the email?
Keep trying. 
Its coincidence to you then, that the coded language they used in emails they thought would be private forever translates to code the FBI has IDd before. This coded language being exchanged with a pizza shop owner who blatantly uses pedo vernacular in a public online setting is yet another coincidence. Tony Podesta being life long friends with the US' most powerful admitted 'serial child molester' is yet another pedophilia related coincidence.\n\nBums me out man, if this was a few guys in your neighborhood I would hope you would call the cops and ask for an explanation. If you bring a child into this world and you see your rulers emailing this way, those are questions you can't live with unanswered.
AnonScan, if you look at their past few weeks of tweets, was the only originating source of the 2/19 leak date. They featured Assange in a video they made a week ago and seemed to be working together, atleast on twitter. Think that's all of it. AnonScan said 2/19, people assumed they work with Assange, 2/19 became the rumor.
Yeah, that's about right in my opinion. You know how milo makes money right? You understand his shtick? He said this when he was performing his schtick. Podesta emails were never meant to see the light of day. Very key difference.
Guy have you read into PG at all? Do you know there was an admitted serial child molester second in line to the presidency for 7 years? If I told you that same man had been close friends with Steve Bannon for decades as they rose through the DC power structure, would you be interested in reading more?
So the lingo is too obvious for it to really be in use? Jesus.\n\nWe really are a 'compliant and unaware citizenry'.
This is pretty funny man. One guy was telling me the code words are so obviously pedo incriminating that they can't be true. Now you saying the way they handle email security is so bad it can't be true.\n\nAnd somehow the conclusion was: "Dominos on Cheese or Pasta" should be interpreted literally. "Pizza related maps on handkerchiefs" should be interpreted literally. "Long in place strategies for shipping pasta and sauces" should be interpreted literally.\n
so are you saying they are not talking in code (pizza, pasta, etc) we are just missing context?
what? "Dropping civics" is not a comment on eliminating highschool government classes across the nation.\n\nIf bill is speaking from the perspective of all of government, why would he still value strong unawareness but only worry about the fading compliance? 
10000:1 Odds that John Podesta, a man who works directly for presidents and gets new ones (nearly) elected, truly left a handkerchief behind with an actual map drawn on it that was related to pizza pie, and the realtor thought it was important enough to send to him.\n\nGood luck man. You know for what its worth I don't want it to be true. My wifes world would shatter, my dads 401k would plummet, the country would descend into chaos. All I want is the FBI to hold a presser and say we looked into, it was all a misunderstanding. Then I would get the fuck off the internet, get back to sleeping regularly, and enjoy my very nice life. Don't conflate everybody who thinks there is truth here with people who want there to be truth.
Yeah I'm in agreement there then. Team HRC and team political mainstream have a huge overlap then, considering this is an email to person running HRCs campaign.
Of course not, but that's the fun! It's like does anybody know the speaker of the house for 7 years was an admitted 'serial child molestor' and was sentenced to 15 months just last year? Of course not! We are the "unaware and compliant citizenry" Bill Ivey wants us to be.
My point is he is rich and famous for saying things so disagreeable violent riots precede and cancel his scheduled speeches. Lo and behold, he again says something so disagreeable he is on every newspaper. He has never forgotten his mic is on. Don't think we should pretend this is the same as your neighbor talking to you in the front yard.
Well now that begs the question, do you and bannon define the alt right the same way? Think that's the point. I thought I was alt right for a year until election time came and CNN told me what alt right was. Get it?
Does he say anything else that's shocking? When he's performing?
Believe me Dennis hastert and tony podesta have been friends for 60 years and emails sent at the time of hasterts indictment indicate both podestas were aware of his pedofelia. 
They met in Japan in the 60s, there are numerous pictures of them together there in Camp Nose. Tony says himself, in an email to a mutual friend from Japan, that he has kept in touch with Denny after all these years since their time at Camp Nose.\n\nThey are very clearly 'decades long friends'. I don't understand why you would ommitt all the evidence of them being friends when discussing that very subject, instead calling it 'absurd'. Why did you do that?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/snowfaked/status/795414958150483972/photo/1
Do you think by making pedofelia in D.C. a partisan issue it's able to deter honest assessments by more people? Such as reading about the details that power the suspicion?
yeah you don't get it at all. I have always been a critic. Once the coincidences total a certain number I stop calling them coincidences. Harder for me to stick my head in the sand.\n\ngoogle "compliant and unaware citizenry", that's how the ruling class talks about the public when the camera is off.

Guy, what? Given what Alefontis writes on his instagram, given 5 decades of friendship with Dennis Hastert, given FBI code definitions, given every email and every other detail of PG, what meaning of those words makes the most sense to you? It is either literal or its code. Literal makes no sense to me. If its code, its either pedo or its something else. Given everything I have read and seen pedo sounds far more likely than 'other'. Its one of those three things, literal, code-pedo, code-other. If I held a gun to your moms head and asked you to take your best guess, what would yours be?
Being an adult is not an explanation for choosing that imagery of the infinite possibilities available to you. Being an adult doesn't make things appear on walls or comments appear on instagram. These are the results of taste and deliberate actions. Please don't say 'this proves nothing' because everybody under the sun agrees. I would ask though, if you noticed an old associate of yours making pedo references online, how many would he have to make before you would want a cop to talk to him? 1? 2? 5? My take on PG, more particularly Comet PP, is that the collective whole warrants questions from a trained professional. People are routinely investigated for far far less. Don't understand why anybody would be against the honest questioning of the FBI.
93\n\nI have reason to believe, that the war engine described in LAvL is a computer. There is an old article on hermetic.com that also suggests this view. There are ways to transliterate the word Computer in a way so it adds up to 418. And if you are using a qwertz-keyboard, it literally says ZUIO on it. From right to left: Ayin(70)+Yud(10)+Vav(6)+Zayin(7)=93. Its a way to spell the name Aiwaz. For me, computer technology perfectly represents the current of Horus while the web on the other hand, represents the current of Maat.\nAlso i think, VR is a great as a ritual space and as a tool for solitary ceremonial magic in general. Last time i performed the star ruby, i did it in Google Tiltbrush, underneath the virtual stars in order to track and visualize my exact movements (i should really draw the steele of revealing when im in there next time..). Its also good for stuff like drawing sigils.

The one to the past is crossed out.

neck tat confirmed. 
It's really not so known yet. But the maybe funny thing is, that a bunch of the first commercial 4-person Audi units from the early fourties of a certain potential future, had gravity generators that could spin out of balance and break down when the locks were "misscalibrated" a bit too much. \n\nMany of the early adopters of this unit are now stuck with us here in this specific worldline and they don't really know why. They all expected to end up on different versions of their own past. Not more than one unit (if any), should have end up here or anywhere, yet those peope already start to organize in small secretive groups with the goal to support eachother and welcome/calm down the new arrivals. Some of them are honestly worried, that one version of themselves might have ended up in every single frame of their past within those sick +30% divergences those crazy future motherfuckers do for fun. lol. maybe we can do the same in like 20 years, but it doesn't look like it yet. Based on their own past, they expected/calculated CERN to have stabilized micro-singularities about four years ago*, before most of them even arrived here. But here, no information and no signs that CERN is anywhere near or that they are even trying to do this, which is why the units can't the repaired for now. \nMany of the travellers who are already here since 2014 or before, have accepted that they will have to stay for now and maybe forever, and that they can't do much about it because really, they are just kids from the future with no deep knowledge about physics, trying high-divergency trips as a demonstrably effective alternative to a permanent drug-trip. Whatever attracts them here is perhaps what could bring some of them back home in the end. perhaps this worldline is destined for dense time traffic or maybe it's the same everywhere as time goes on, i don't know. \n\n*with a >95% probability within the +/-0.5% per-year divergence that their units are supposed to support if they wouldn't have tampered with them.

Yes, blue for Jupiter. That's the point I was trying to make.
If you expect something to be thrown inside the finally block, you would put the second try block inside the finally block in order to preserve clarity and limit its scope.\n\nAlso in Java it is ((almost)) never OK to catch a Throwable. Doing this is called pokemon exception handling and not only discouraged for poor style, but also because it could potentially be dangerous for the stability of your programs. I think the most scary thing in OPs pic, is that there is only one single line in the throwable pokemon catch block. It better ends with "; throw e;"\n\nIf you have to stabilize a system with a huge java codebase of old legacy code, finding and replacing or refactoring the pokemons is probably something that you may consider doing as soon as possible. Software quality tools like sonarqube also shitmark all the pokemons it finds in your code with a high priority.\n

I think the box used as an O is another +1. The single most important change that could be made on this, would probably be to make the box and the text the same color or better, replace the box with an O.
Not sure if that's what you mean. But technically speaking, they are most likely generated by drawing circles, lines and letters on a context2d element with X and Y coordinates, that is used with a Canvas-object to create a png image or whatever graphics format it is using. I think it contains a trigonometry based custom algorithm to arrange and nest randomly selected elements like the circles, lines and triangles etc. into bigger circles. I have reason to believe it is done like this, because I developed similar applications a few years back in order to generate and visualize  astrological charts or for transliterating words and simple sentences into circular gallifreyan.

Thanks. I see the ~3.8 x 10^68 is somewhere between 52! and 53!.\nBut what i'm more interested about, is how it would compare to other numbers or sentences. \nOr how typical the 698 result would be (i assume there should be a bell curve?).\n\nUniform selection doesn't really apply i guess. But maybe i could find out how much the difference from uniformly selected letters, to a selection expected by the distribution in english-language is. ~0.683% isn't far off from what i would expect by gut, but the actual chance for a "typical english 50-letter sentence" would probably be a bit higher (maybe ~2-3%).\n\n>"random English"\nPerhaps a bad choice of words. What i was thinking may be possible somehow, is to take 8167 times 1 for "a" (because "a" is 8,167% frequent in the english language), add 1492 times 2 for "b" (because "b" is 1.492% frequent) etc. until "z" and then divide that down to 50. Now that i think about it, i could try to do something in excel. Will reply in a day or so, if i do it, unless someone else can make a good argument and put the 698 for the english 50-letter sentence into perspective.

Also they use gematrix.org which is highly questionable, even flawed. \n\nI'm aware that there are different methods for transliteration and for calculation, but just check the numbers on that pic and look up the standard value of the corresponding hebrew letters. Almost everything is wrong or very different from what you would expect. \n\nI think what it does instead of transliteration, is using the latin alphabet and assign it with numerical values by the same logic that is traditionally used for the hebrew or greek alphabet. Sure, one can do that and it even leads to more distinct results than the standard and than many of the more obscure traditional methods. You could take a dice to roll a number for each letter and declare that to be your qabalah forever, but i've never seen anyone doining it like this except for "internet-foilhats". Please comment if you think i'm wrong here.

I agree. \n\n>time is money\n\n>have the motivation\n\nIf you wan't to see a harmless example, check out what /r/ingress ingress is. A sub of +30K "agents" playing a 24/7 augmented reality game, where they walk around and capture points of interest and destroy virtual things from the other team all around the world. I know many people in this community, and i see many of them are very involved, to the point that the game becomes a huge part of their life and of who they are. They travel far and spend a lot of time. Some of them even do things, like datamining information about the agents of the other team and their actions. Even actual temporary gangstalking isn't uncommon in certain situations of the game (of course, it's not comparable to what this sub is about, since it's in the context of the game and the other agents know this)\n\nBut why? All just for experience points. ...Experience points, really? yea, in a way. But in the end, what matters more, are connections to the other people who do the same.\n\nNow, replace ingress and the ingress-intel-map with a palantir instance, then replace all points of interest with TIs, and maybe add some positive reinforcements like paying $$ for certain goals.\nI wouldn't be surprised if they customize their system with like a shitty palantir-plugin that actually gives out **experience points** for certain activities done by the perps.\n\nFor the record: I temporarily added a chevron to the Logo of this sub, in order to acknowledge and draw some attention to the existence of Palantir.

Sounds like you are gang-stalked. I've experienced the same thing with black and white cars a few years back when i was on the roll.

This also confirms Half-Life 3. But really, the point is, that "Cern" is the nickname of the horned god Cernunnos.\n\nEdit: I find it interesting, that you "chop off the C".

I think Virgo is mostly correct; or at least that's what I heard before. \nBut if you get a closer look, you can further break down the cantons of Switzerland like this: Aries: Schaffhausen, Leo: Thurgau; Capricorn: Grisons and Basel; Taurus: Uri, Lucerne and i think Fibourg; Aquarius: Aargau and probably Zug.\nFurthermore some of the other cantons are ruled by constellations that are not part of the zodiac. Aquilla: Geneva; Ursa: both Apenzell and Bern; Musca: Schwyz, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Solothurn. I'm not sure about the others and i wonder if Zurich is ruled by Gemini.
The DC area has been a point of attention for david icke type davinci code internet-researchers, searching for pentagrams, pyramids and molechs since google maps exists:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=dc+pentagram&tbm=isch\nIn terms of esoteric buzzwords, its all about "the flow of energy" directed towards the white house.\n\nI think the interesting question would be, how far back the connections go. \nWhat does the dove symbolize? Why is there a district named virginia?\n
Not sure, but I watched the entire thing live. The student union had its windows broken, a light pole was knocked over and set ablaze, many faschcans (fascist trashcans) were burned. Then they made their way downtown and smashed the hell out of every ATM at Wells Fargo, BoA, and Chase, along with smashing all of their windows. Starbucks' windows were smashed and the store looted. Graffiti saying, "Kill Fascists, Kill Trump, Antifa" painted all over the campus and downtown. \n\nFrom what I could see, it was just Antifa doing all the violent stuff, but the rest of the crowd was just following them around cheering them on. The only time I saw the police was on campus at the auditorium, they didn't move from there. 
$15B eh? Under budget, ahead of schedule.\n\nGet this friend some bricks.
I'm tempted to turn on CNN just to see hysteria, but nah, they don't deserve my view. 
We want "yes" for the shitstorm it causes, right?
Woah man, get out of here with this logic. The big bad drumpf is definitely being bribed, 17 intelligence agencies say so. 
Anyone have the sauce of the real news about what the Australian PM said? I'm curious to see what the conversation was actually like.

This line has actually been turned into a counter-shill. 4channers started spamming it in obvious shill threads to call them out, it's mocking them. 
6 was a pretty strange number to win by as well, I'm not much into football but wouldn't 6 be just as likely or less likely than 8 points considering OT is pretty rare?
> You can't even make this shit up.\n\nWell you can, because he did...
He basically said that he blew his Catholic priest as boy, not because he was forced to but because he wanted to, and he still feels like it was consensual and doesn't regret it. \n\nI don't think at all that he's advocating for molestation of young boys, he's just saying that some young pubescent males are the ones begging for it and not the other way around. Not saying that that makes it OK for an adult to engage in sexual activities with a minor, but sometimes such as in Milo's case it is consensual and the child does not grow up to be traumatized by it. \n\nAlso, he defines pedophilia as engaging in sexual acts with children that are pre-pubescent, even though today we associate the term children to mean under the legal age of 18. 
She's going to have a lot of time to write soon..
I hope this is true, it will surely create new levels of liberal hysteria. We all know the Nobel Peace Prize is a bunch of bullshit anyway

No, they aren't going to axe it without a transition plan put in place, they aren't just going to leave many people without insurance. What I'm guessing will happen is there will be a certain window that will likely be open for months in which both the old system and new system are in place, giving the population plenty of time to switch over to the new plan before the old one is phased out. 
 I think he mad, bro
Sure, make one.

Stefan Molyneux made a pretty detailed video on him if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCgD9OTqizA&t=1515s
Is it a coincidence when dissenting opinions and everything-other-than left wing sources are banned from the prominent political subreddit? Is it a coincidence that there is a far more active right-wing subreddit with actual organic content rather than paid for and bot manipulated posts dictating what makes it to the top? Is it a coincidence that this subreddit is largely censored from /r/all even though it is one of, if not the most active on the website?
If it is compromised, which is a possibility, it's not by the Russians, it's most likely by the CIA. Of course the CIA probably wants you to think it's a Russian outlet so they can further push their agenda.
No one takes this subreddit seriously, it's just a place for liberals to scream and whine. It's been compromised for many months, no dissenting views are allowed.
We can fall back to a new subreddit, but fuck that. \n\nI don't think they can ban us though. Our mods are top notch at making sure the sitewide rules are followed. If the admins come up with some excuse, or plant doxxers here to shut us down, they've lost. When this sub goes down, so does any resemblance of open discussion on this website, and it will be clear. At that point it will turn into a dying leftist echo chamber. At that point I'd expect a rather large influx to /r/conspiracy as the plot to shut us down will be exposed there, then they'll have to ban /r/conspiracy as well which will be the final nail in their coffin. \n\nAnd don't go to /pol/ it's a libertarian board ;)
Will he help push arrests for child trafficking cases? Yeah probably. Are many high profile senators and politicians going to be arrested? I really doubt it, but I guess all we can do is wait and see. 
Was following this all last night. The dam currently seems to be under control, it has been drained to the point where the water is now sitting under the lip of the emergency spillway. This level is at 901', apparently the rate of drainage is reducing the lake by 4" per hour. \n\nThe break in the primary spillway has been filled in with rocks airlifted in by helicopters. \n\nThey will continue to let out water out of the main spillway at about 100K cubic ft/s to further lower the levels.\n\nThe question now is, can they drain enough out of the lake before it starts raining again? It is supposed to rain starting Wednesday all the way through Tuesday. If the emergency spillway is going to break, it's probably not going to happen until late this week. 
Down with the vegan agenda! MilkMan is based.

It's used as a way to derail discussion on other legitimate topics that they don't want you to discuss. 
Nah, they're just Anti-Life
There's an extremely effective method of opposing others' views and expressing your own, it's called debate. 
I've heard they are draining it at about 4" per hour, which seems fairly quick. There's also a constant runoff from snow melt in the mountains that I've heard is dumping in about 44K cubic ft/s, less than half the rate that the main spillway is draining. \n\nIt sounds like they've got plenty of time to drain the lake to a safe level, unless they really get some massive rains. \n\nIt looks like the concern now may shift to the river, not the dam, the river is probably already getting a bit wider, but it still has a lot of room before it really expands out and spills over into residential areas. \n\nPersonally, I don't think anything major will come of this other than some minor flooding near the river. But if they can't control the lake levels then the erosion may collapse the land around the emergency spillway which would be bad. I'm not sure if there's any risk of the main spillway that has the hole in it further expanding, and even so it seems like even if the whole main spillway collapsed, they could still let the water run down the hill into the river (at least for a while before the erosion got to dangerous levels). 
Probably mostly people who have just left them running, they likely originally wanted to push for an XT fork, but now they've just let them sit and have forgot about them. 
Wow 0 confirmation deposits, revolutionary...
Actually he pointed out in a recent video that only somewhere around 30-35% (I think, would need to re-watch) of his viewers are Gen Z, most are actually millennials or older. Which is also a good thing, the millennials are currently some of the most brainwashed and they are starting to get fed up with the bullshit mainstream narrative. 
It includes 6 more countries in addition to Iraq and is set to expire after 90 days, that's about it.

Can't do much about the downvotes other than upvoting everything you can on new.\n\nBut.. Throw this line back at them in every shill thread you see, "Not gonna lie, former Trump voter here. This is fucking hilarious watching Trump crash and burn.. But in all seriousness we can't let this man get the nuclear codes!"\n\nThis is working well to mock and expose shill threads on 4chan, and can work here too. \n\n
Well if the polls say 24%, she's probably closer to 40%. 
I can't remember exactly, but I believe eBay banned them from being sold, or sellers were just getting scammed with chargebacks. \n\nI believe the original ones are pretty rare and desirable though. \n\nSomeone feel free to correct me.
All that matters is hype and speculation. If it gets approved, you better bet that people are going to heavily buy in (not just to the ETF, mostly on other exchanges) which will surely run the market price up. 
Because it's an echo chamber, just like you pointed out. Just like /r/politics is for the left. There's no middle ground on this website because the admins don't want it. This sub is one of the closest things we have to a place for actual civilized political discussion. 
Later on in the video he even admits that he believes the current age of consent is about right and has no objections to it. \n\nHe joked about something that he probably shouldn't have, which is saying a lot for someone like myself who believes that just about nothing is off limits to joke about.\n\nThe video is question is also around a year old, the media have been sitting on it and coordinating and just waiting to strike as soon as they realized Milo is a real force against their evil propaganda machine. \n\nIt sure is sad, I can only hope the public sees through the bullshit, but I now that many are still asleep and will blindly follow the hivemind of the media. 
Nice, looks like he cannot divide us. 
I'm getting suspicious of Pence as well. I doubt Trump really wanted Pence as his VP, which is why he waited until the last minute to pick him, but it was the only way the GOP would give him the nomination. \n\nThe deep state plan all along was probably to get Trump out and Pence and Ryan in. 
I believe in class privilege. If you're born into a well off family, you are likely to be more privileged than others who are born into poverty. It happens to be that the more intelligent people are more likely to be in those positions of financial stability. \n\nNow, using IQ as a measure of intelligence, it does happen to be that on average white people have higher IQs than say blacks and hispanics, while still a bit lower than asians ([source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Sketch-4race-transparent.png/400px-Sketch-4race-transparent.png)). So yes, if you consider intelligence a privilege, then whites and asians are privileged. 
That article is shit, but Bannon is a very powerful figure. DJT and Bannon share the same visions, they are two peas in a pod, and so far they are making things happen in a swift manner. You voted for a President on that basis that you'd trust his appointees, and if you didn't then you shouldn't vote at all, this isn't a dictatorship. 
Don't stoop to their level..
There's really only a few places on the mainstream internet that are not censored by leftist interests. T_D and 4Chan /pol/ being the most popular of these. \n\nI believe it was moreso the suppression of dissenting opinion, and the absolutely obvious media collusion with the DNC that brought about disgust in voters which in turn lead to the Trump victory. \n\nT_D and /pol/ probably weren't changing many voters minds, they are more just a place to laugh at the leftist groupthink and consequently cheerlead for the other side. \n
The left: "WTF is he doing, he already won"
Yes, he's one of the large perpetrators but surely not the only. You have to realize, there comes a point where you have so much money that there's no material possession that will fulfill your desires, the only thing left to buy is power and influence. These sick fucks get pleasure out of creating dissent and chaos for no other reason than to watch the world burn. 
I wonder why they haven't suicided James yet. 
yeah, I saw that too, it might have actually been a benevolent troll posting in non-Trump supporting subreddits (pretty much all of them). It is an extremely effective method to bring light to the presence of real astroturfing, if a normie sees the line more than a couple times they will start to realize that liberal shilling is actually a real thing. \n\nMemetic warfare is a very effective method of awakening the masses.
The 9th circuit is famously liberal, which makes sense for the area it serves. I'm sure there's also circuits that are very conservative as well. Since we don't have 100% unbiased robots running the courts, it's a good thing that we have multiple courts that lean in different ways to balance things out. \n\nNow I'm not arguing that the supreme court is perfect either, but they are held to a much higher standard when it comes to political bias. \n\nI'm no lawyer, but 8 U.S. Code § 1182 seems pretty straight forward when it says\n>  Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nNow, from my understanding one of the main reasons the Washington ruling was upheld is because of Trump's intent. The executive order itself is not a ban on Muslims, it is a ban on people from 7 countries that happen to be primarily Muslim. But because President Trump has expressed his disdain for Islam, that may make some precedent that the executive order discriminates against a religion which is unconstitutional.\n\nThat is up to the supreme court to decide, no matter how they rule I will respect their judgement, I generally do have faith in the supreme court.\n\nI'm not super for or against the immigration ban by the way, I think it could have been done better, but I am for border security and strict vetting. Seeing the harm that Islamic terrorists have done to Europe, I'd sure like to ensure that doesn't happen here. \n\n
watch the video, it has plenty of written evidence and references. skip through and pause if you don't want to listen to him read the references displayed. 
Hell yeah, based Abbott
Sure he can, if he does something illegal. 
Well, when your job is to "correct the record" for 12 hours a day, sometimes you've got to take a break from shitposting and fuck up Wikipedia. 
It's not about undermining the legitimacy of the courts, quite the opposite, it's about keeping the courts legitimate. The courts are here to make rulings based off of law, not partisan standing. However, we've seen that in practice this isn't always the case.\n\nThere's a reason why the 9th circuit is overturned on average between 80-90% in recent years by the supreme court. This is a part of checks and balances, you have one court who regularly tries to bend the law to their partisan beliefs, and then you have the supreme court who makes sure they can't get away with it. It's a good way of stress testing the system to make sure it functions as intended.
Not saying it isn't possible, but the close up video of the collapse looks more like charges detonating all the way down the building. Then again, they were quiet if they were conventional explosives.

Thanks for the insight, I wasn't aware how much the rainfall translated to lake level rises. Looking at [this picture](http://www.trbimg.com/img-58a206e0/turbine/la-me-lake-oroville-spillway-pictures-039/1550/1550x872) it seems like it won't take much more to erode that hill all the way back to the wall, which at that point I'm guessing the structure won't hold. Or even if it does hold, the lake may rise to a point where it will fall over the hill on the other side of the parking lot which also would not be very good. 
Just when you thought the "muh Russians" was finally dismissed for the bullshit it is. Nope, libs are still pushing it. 
To be honest, I don't think replacing Obamacare is going to happen very quickly, it's not something that can be solved with an executive order. I'm sure we will hear more details about the plan throughout the year, but I'd expect it to take many months before a plan is set in place and passed through congress to smoothly transition to a new system. It's a far more complicated matter than securing our borders. 
And they aren't playing just for checkmate, they are playing to take out every single piece first. 
It's hard to say if those results are accurate, because some other background process could be using the drive which is skewing the results.

This is a big business now in India and the like, they spend all of their budget on putting out nasty ads through ad providers that pop up flashing with "your computer is infected! call Microsoft at this number".\n\nThere's probably 1000s of "companies" doing this, they are not likely to infect the victims computers, they just want the $300 they charge to do next to nothing. Some of these guys actually do make an effort to clean up people's computers who falls for the scam, but it's nothing you couldn't do with malwarebytes and ccleaner. 
I honestly don't think we have enough data to say for certain what the increased levels of greenhouse gases are actually going to do to our planet. Currently, there hasn't been any major change in our climate outside of normal variance. Taking sample sizes from even the past couple hundred years are just too small to conclude that human activity is indeed making any significant impact on the naturally changing climate cycles, there's just not enough data.\n\nIt is logical to assume based off of ice-core data that increased greenhouses gases do in fact raise global temperatures, however what's not often discussed is the diminishing returns of the effect of greenhouse gases on temperature increase. The long term trends of the ice-core data show that we're either very close (within 10s of thousands of years) to the end of a warm period, or we've already started a decent into a cold period. It's my personal belief that the global warming is a scare tactic to promote an economic and political agenda. While human activity may be increasing volatility of short term climate patterns, I highly doubt we're making any significant dent in the Earth's nature cycles to a point of uninhabibility.\n\nPollution is definitely bad from a health perspective, that's undeniable, and the push towards renewable/clean energy is good thing for this point alone. 
shills are flooding /pol/ with hundreds of the same thread with a picture of a pizza and "yfw pizzagate is real". I think mods are being instructed to remove them, and are possibly removing real threads that are actually trying to discuss it.

Good question, I wish I could tell you. I work in the tech industry and am tired of getting my tech news from libshits.

Facebook is just as bad or worse, they don't throttle but rather just blatantly delete posts. But he does use FB as well, they wouldn't dare delete his posts. \n\nTwitter is still the largest platform for this sort of thing, I don't Trump could give a damn about the replies being filtered and throttled, everyone is still seeing what he has to say which is what matters. 
If you're endorsing peaceful protest, that is fine, it is our right to peacefully assemble. The Antifas/anarchists were the only ones actually performing the beatings and property damage, most of the protesters were just hanging around dancing to music.\n\nThe problem arises when the small group does commit crimes and the rest of the group sticks around and cheers them on. At that point, it then ceases to be a peaceful demonstration, even if the majority of the crowd has done nothing wrong. It's not acceptable or lawful to beat anyone if they have not attacked you first, even if you scream "Nazi! Nazi!" first. And it's never acceptable to smash windows, ATMs, and take innocent trash can lives.\n\nThe most fucked up thing about this whole situation was the police standing down. All they needed to do was arrest the antifas to get the situation under control, and yet they did nothing.

To be honest, the consequence is that there will be no consensus in the foreseeable future. Most miners still don't care about a fork, and for good reason, they're currently making bank off of transaction fees. The ones that do care are split down the middle right now between segwit and BU. What this means is that it's not likely for either to activate any time in near future, it will be up to second layer solutions like Teechan to keep BTC viable as a payment network. 
Last one of these threads here I got my post deleted for pointing out that shills are spamming 4chan /pol/ with fake pizzagate threads, all with the same picture and one line saying "yfw pizzagate is real". There were hundreds of these threads popping up.\n\nIt seems like the shills are trying to get mods to delete their own pg threads along with any that may be asking for legitimate discussion. I have no idea why previous posted on this sub was deleted for pointing this out. \n\nedit: Damn, looks like the guy who posted this thread was just banned. wtf
Do you remember Twittergate that happened not more than a couple months ago? Hundreds of twitter accounts were exposed publicly sharing hardcore child porn, right out in the open. \n\nIt was slid so quickly out of the spotlight by I'm not even sure what, there was a lot of election shit going on obviously. 
agreed. I think the implication was that Prescott helped create the political and economic climate to justify the creation of the CIA
Likely nothing serious, you've probably been infected with some minor malware that is routing your internet traffic through a proxy.\n\nRun through scans with Adwcleaner and Malwarebytes, see if the problem is resolved. Also check Internet Options > Connections > Lan Settings and make sure that there's no check box in the  "use a proxy server for your lan" and that the textbox under that is clear. Malware will often revert these settings back, so run the above cleaners first. 
Talcum X strikes again
Sounds like a straight up fabrication, first time hearing of it. 
it's not ready to be activated actually, it still is only being signaled by about 25% of miners, it needs 90% which is probably never going to happen unless viabtc disappears.

The easiest way to clean up OS corruption on Win 10 is to run an in-place upgrade/repair install. To do this use the tool here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\n\nedit: hopefully this is one exe that will run, otherwise you may need to try another system restore point, or do a clean install. Also be sure to check the health of your HDD with something like Crystaldiskinfo

Honestly, I was 7 during 9/11, and though it seems everyone else says they remember it, I can't really recall it at all, more than vague guesses I have pieced together from what I was told. That said, I think it is because my memory is much more idea based than episodic, but thats just my guess. I was also 7 at the time, not sure what age GHW was.\n\nAlso, people often laugh at uncomfortable times, which this could be, so I hope people don't think a small smirk is proof of his involvement.
Sure. Bush is talking about Gerald Ford's involvement with the Warren Commission and in regards to the JFK assassination laughs to himself when he get the part about the "deluded gunman" in reference to Lee Harvey Oswald. The fact he is laughing about a "deluded gunman" implies that he knows that isn't the real story and Bush was even present in the Dealy Plaza area during the assassination.\n\nBasically Bush is laughing reading the eulogy at that part because he knows that isn't true.
You didn't really believe it until you were able to find the shittiest proof possible?
HW, is that you? 
This is Shaquille O'Neal levels of reach
No big deal. Nervous reaction as all politicians smile at crowds. Don't get all worked up. 
I believe in a JFK conspiracy I just don't think that this shows anything. He was reading a speech and just had a poorly timed smile.
As Kickercvr said above, Russ Baker wrote an interesting book several years back, "Family of Secrets" he skips over several another damning document that anyone can request from NARA that were brought up with this one during the 1988 election.  Both George and learn to read Barbara have not been entirely forthcoming on what exactly was going on that day. 
explains the sanctions that went on for ever until he died.\n\nHad not even thought about that.  My Dad was a JKF conspiracy buff, and he thinks it was the Mafia which is what I'm basing this on.  JFK did piss off Frank Sinatra, and his brother similarly did piss off the mob.\n\nIntellectually and morally, it always pissed me off, but when I contemplated your comment, I thought 'well that's fair then'.  Because of the numerous assassination attempts the CIA made trying to get Fidel.  Exploding cigars.

Yeah. An oldie but a goodie. If you look, the Sheraton Dallas Hotel is two turns and 1.05 miles from Dealey Plaza.\n\n\n......and don't forget the 1947 note from Congressman Richard Nixon to the chair of the House on UnAmerican Activities asking for Mr Jack Rubenstein to be excused from testifying as he was working on "information functions" for Congressman Nixon's Staff.
Ah- Prescott...\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar\n\n> George Bush's grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director and shareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the financial backers of Nazi Germany.\n\n> The Guardian has obtained confirmation from newly discovered files in the US National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism.\n\n> His business dealings, which continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act, has led more than 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought in Germany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers at Auschwitz and to a hum of pre-election controversy.\n\nAnd GHWB's mother's father (Prescott's father in law) was George Herbert Walker- president of WA Harriman, which went on to be Brown Brothers Harriman- led by Prescott.\n\nWhat did the Walkers and the Bushes and the Harrimans (Averall) all have in common other than their love of banking and financing war?  They were all members of Skull and Bones at Yale- along with several others who served on the board of directors at BBH.  Including Robert A Lovett.  What do you know about Robert A Lovett?\n\n> Lovett was born on September 14, 1895 in Huntsville, Texas, to Robert S. Lovett, president and chairman of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad. Lovett graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown, PA in 1914. He was a member of the Skull and Bones society at Yale University[\n\nYou know who else went to Hill School? Robert Baker (George HW Bush's lawyer- Baker Botts and Carlyle buddy), and Donald Trump's son, Eric...\n\n> He served in the cabinet of President Harry S. Truman from 1951 to 1953 and in this capacity, directed the Korean War.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Lovett\n\nBeyon his position as Secretary of Defense under Truman, he was notably one of the "six wisemen":\n\n> members of the East Coast foreign policy establishment. Starting in the immediate post-World War II period, the group developed the containment policy of dealing with the Communist bloc during the Cold War. They also helped to craft institutions and initiatives such as NATO, the World Bank, and the Marshall Plan.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Men_(book)\n\n- Dean Acheson, Secretary of State under President Harry Truman\n    \n- Charles E. Bohlen, U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Philippines, and France\n\n- W. Averell Harriman, special envoy for President Franklin Roosevelt\n\n- George F. Kennan, ambassador to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia\n\n- Robert A. Lovett, Truman's Secretary of Defense\n\n- John J. McCloy, a War Department official and later US High Commissioner for Germany.\n\nYou probably know who Dean Acheson is, so lets start with Bohlen- who is that guy?\n\n> Bohlen's great-great-uncle was American Civil War general Henry Bohlen, the first foreign-born (German) Union general in the Civil War and the grandfather of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, who used the name Krupp after marrying Bertha Krupp, an heiress of the Krupp family of German weapons makers).\n\n> He was thus was related to Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, Germany's primary weapons maker during World War II. Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was indicted for war crimes at the Nuremberg tribunal, but illness prevented his prosecution until his demise in 1950. Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was found guilty of war crimes but was pardoned after a few years by John J. McCloy.\n\nInteresting... So McCloy was one of the 6 wisemen with Bohlen, and pardoned Bohlen's german uncle who was found guilty of Nazi war crimes.  \n\nWhat was McCloy doing prior to 1941 when he became Assistant Secretary of War...?:\n\n> McCloy went to New York to become an associate in the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, which was then one of the nation's most prestigious law firms. He moved to Cravath, Henderson, & de Gersdorff in 1924, where he worked with many wealthy clients, such as the St. Paul Railroad. In 1934 McCloy found new evidence allowing him to re-open an action for damages against Germany for the destruction caused by the 1916 Black Tom explosion.[4] He did a great deal of work for corporations in Nazi Germany and advised the major German chemical combine I. G. Farben, later notorious for manufacturing Zyklon B. By the time he left for government service in 1940, McCloy earned about $45,000 a year and had savings of $106,000. \n
Check out the book family of secrets, 3 generations of Bush's chronicled. Heavily sourced & great for the conspiracy nerd. 
I am not denying that. A fool would deny that. 
Prescott and the Bushes by way of Chemical Bank were primary bankers for alot of Siemens and Krupp's war/ trade credit facilities.\n\nWhen the war started Army Intelligence needed a larger more coordinated intelligence system to match the MI6 thru 8 setup. In response to this the US Gov. turned to corporate intelligence firms and fund managers to construct OSS. In this regard, many of the analysts who were working on Chemical Bank files (due diligence & otherwise) were looped into the first class of fundraisers, assets and case officers. It was not until the Bill Colby era that this class turned power over to the modern establishment.\n\n\n
And completely out of place... Super strange to even bring up Kennedy at all at the funeral of Ford. 
Why should Gerald Ford be trusted?!?He was a fucking Mason and Trilateral Commission member.George(Masonic nickname:Magog)H.W.Bush is one of the biggest pieces of shit of all time.\n\n“George Herbert Walker Bush: ‘Sarah, if the American people ever find out what we have done, they would chase us down the street and lynch us.’ That is a famous 1992 quote by George Herbert Walker Bush to Sarah McLendon, a Texas journalist who Bush had known for years and who was the grand dame of the White House press corps at the time. McLendon had asked Bush: ‘What will the people do if they ever find out the truth about Iraq-gate and Iran contra?'”\n\nhttp://m.dailykos.com/story/2013...\n\nYeah,I don't expect any truth coming out of this shitheads mouth.
Wow, hadn't seen that before. Gawd, he's so creeper... 
I some times involuntary laugh when I'm accused of something I didn't do, just saying. This isn't proof of anything.
Well said. \n\nPersonally, I was on my way to my high school Physics class (ironically) when I heard the news and I remember feeling almost excited and giddy at first. It wasn't that I and others were happy in the slightest, but your description of the phenomenon of laughter and anxiety was quite interesting and something I could relate to. \n\nThings definitely took a somber turn once we had time to sit down and see what was going on, with the excitement turning more towards anger, but it's strange that for myself and many others the anxiety manifested into a feeling of giddy excitement. \n\nThis might be what many would feel when going to war and initially charging off excited and possibly giddy before realization sets in. (Sorry I'm a bit off topic but thought I'd share.)
Who knows the list of secrets he'll take the to grave. Even during the election and since, it's clear that Trump won't dare touch the Bush cartel and Clinton certainly wouldn't have gone after the war crimes of her "brother-in-law" W.\n\nEven from the shadows the Bush's remain too powerful. At least our nation got some catharsis from seeing Jeb! steamrolled.
I was going to mention that. Russ Baker's work on Family of Secrets was the first time I realized Bush Sr. was likely in Dallas that day. Check this out:\n\nhttp://whowhatwhy.org/2013/09/16/part-1-mr-george-bush-of-the-central-intelligence-agency/
You are very easily convinced when you want to be.
Bush is on record as saying he can't recall where he was on that day. \n\nAnd that's all I needed to hear to know he was involved. 
Remember from childhood? You never giggled as much as when you were accused of something you *didn't* do. But that doesn't disprove anything either, of course.
Well, he was with the CIA, and in Dallas on the date of the assassination.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wSMVh

That particular expression is called [Duper's Delight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjfCCTRWjyU), and is one of the more reliable indications that someone is lying. It's terribly difficult to conceal, even for those who lie professionally.
What he means is "Gerry was a great guy, especially that time that he lied to cover my ass after I committed murder and treason" which would actually be kind of appropriate for a funeral if you're a sick criminal fuck.
Read, Family of Secrets, you won't say 'might' after that.
OP and others should see "Dark Legacy" for more information on the disgusting Bush family.
Never go full retard
I'm terribly hard of hearing and the closed captioning isn't working. Would someone be so kind to give me the nutshell version of what he's saying?\n
You added extra time with your reply, including the extra ...\n\nThe upside is more of your time will be wasted here, we're not done with you yet 👍🏻
I'm 68 and I remember where I was - in Geometry class.  I also remember where I was when I heard that Elvis and John Lennon died.  My parents as well, and some others close to me.  
Great book. Really woke me up.
George H. W. Bush was 41 at the time, was part (and later head) of the CIA and had an already established family history in politics. There are photos of men at Dealy Plaza that match both him and George Jr. to a T in age, posture, facial structure, hairline, even mannerisms. I would say there's a pretty slim chance in hell he doesn't know where he was at the time.\n\nOf course, it isn't proof of his involvement, but it's very strong evidence of him consciously lying about his whereabouts on that day. [Combined with a book's worth of additional, unexplained circumstances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZdd7aIDW9M), the picture becomes pretty clear, though. 
And he repeatedly claimed not to remember where he was when Kennedy got taken out, which is suspicious for two reasons. \n\nFirstly, anyone alive at the time remembers where they were when they heard the news, just like everyone in my generation remembers exactly where they were when they first saw the twin towers ablaze. \n\nAnd secondly, we have [photos of a man at Dealy Plaza](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0NGqYct7MQ/hqdefault.jpg) looking strikingly similar to George Bush, from his hairline, posture, all the way down to the way he was known to cock his fist when he put his hands in his pockets.
> And secondly, we have photos of a man at Dealy Plaza looking strikingly similar to George Bush\n\nNo, you have a white man with a generic haircut in a suit.
Thanks. Watching now.
>Firstly, anyone alive at the time remembers where they were when they heard the news, just like everyone in my generation remembers exactly where they were when they first saw the twin towers ablaze.\n\n\nAlmost everyone remembers the horrible attacks that forever changed our country on 9/11... except of course the President of the United States.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm73wOuPL60\n\n
Sweet mother, I hadn't seen that before! Good find!
The **real** story behind the JFK shooting and more: https://youtu.be/U1Qt6a-vaNM\n\nWell worth the 3.5 hours.
It may mean that in their elite circle it is well known that he got rid off.
I was your age when Bill Clinton was inaugurated. They made us watch it on TV so I remember it quite vividly, even them carrying away Bush on that helicopter 
JFK Jr named his magazine GEORGE for a reason, and it wasn't for George Washington. 
One thing people don't often take into consideration about post-WWII politics is that a huge number of the guys that ended up in politics, intelligence, and the military had already killed other people.  They were also used to working in units, and maintaining secrecy.   \n\nIn other words the Kennedy assassination was not that different than other covert operations they had already done. 
Except those things are total bullshit.
No no no... He dumb
can you host the .zip?
Hey, friend. I felt a sudden urge to respond to your comment.\n\nI was in 6th grade during 9/11, making me only a few years older than you. I was 10. I remember that particular day like it was yesterday. Do I remember the specifics of the day? No. But I remember where I was and how the emotions of those around me, particularly adults, were so unusual compared to the normal, every day. Most people our age, I imagine, remember that day because we were able to recognize that blatant change in collective emotional display by our parents, teachers, guardians, etc. To not be able to recognize and feel the enormous grief on that day, I'd suggest, is symbolic of how a child with Aspergers Syndrome might have experienced 9/11. I'm not saying you have Aspergers. I'm just suggesting that to not have been more aware on that day, even at a very young age, is unusual. \n\nAdditionally, regarding your comment about laughter, I'd like to add this. Anxiety and laughter are two sides of the same phenomenon. We laugh at a time when anxiety is completely seen through and let go. For example, most people fear being poor. So, if someone had been told they were going bankrupt, they'd feel anxious. But, if it was later said that they were not going bankrupt and that they were lied to, the person might then laugh about the situation. The anxiety was seen through and determined as unnecessary. \n\nIn that same way, when laughter or lightheartedness is seen through, anxiety develops. If in that same situation, the liar had returned yet again to say, "Actually, I'm not lying. You're going bankrupt," then the laughter dies and the anxiety takes control of our conscious state.\n\nI say all of that to suggest that GWB was in a tipsy-turny emotional state because he was acting as a joker does. The joker is the card in the deck that can play all roles. The joker laughs, even when he is serious. That is unusual and symbolic of knowing something behind the scenes. In my opinion, it seems as though GWB laughs because he sees through the anxiety that one might feel if one were to commit an act of murder and begin fearing being caught. Once you realize you are not going to be caught, the anxiety evolves into laughter. \n\nIf you laugh at an uncomfortable time, you are nervous. It isn't because you're sad. It's because you fear you are losing something. That is the phenomenon of laughter and anxiety. You get nervous when you feel you are going to lose something and you feel silly/giggly when you realize there is nothing to lose, or when an otherwise 'serious' situation is realized to be not serious.\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong. I'm offering another perspective on all of it. Cheers :)
Chair of the Warren Commission was Allen Dulles, whom Kennedy had fired from his position of CIA Director.  Dulles as PISSED at Kennedy and steered the members to the conclusion that it was a 'lone gunman', and Oswald was dead so the deal was sealed.  There was no real investigation.  It was a setup of Oswald as the patsy.
35 seconds I'll never get back...
**Reporter:**  What do you think about JFK's assassination?\n\n**Bush:**  I wasn't in Dallas that day.\n\n**Reporter:**  That's not what I asked you.\n\n**Bush:**  Oh, uhh I mean, such a tragedy....
I'm glad someone understands the sarcasm, shows that the photo is bogus, BUT THEN shows actual evidence that Bush was in Dallas during the shooting. Thank you.
That's quite damning, in a way. A "tell" for lying is the tendency to inject far more detail than necessary, to try to give an air of authenticity. The actual result is a weakening of the lie. In this case, he could have stopped after "make sense of that madness" and it would actually have made more sense.
Who REALLY gives a fuck about the Kennedys? Maybe Joe Jr. was a stand-up guy. Maybe he would have been a good moral compass for the family. We'll never know, because he died in WWII. What we do know, is that the three other brothers (John, Robert, and Theodore) were all scumbags. Not one could keep their dicks in their pants. They were privileged assholes who thought their wealth and family position (Camelot) made them immune to EVERYTHING! Joe Kennedy Sr begged Sam Giancana (Chicago Mob) to help get his son John elected. Italians liked the idea, as Kennedy would be the first Catholic President (since most Italians are Catholic.....). The first thing JFK did was make his little brother Attorney General. The first thing he did was go after organized crime. Giancana through a common mistress (Judith Campbell Exner), asked JFK to tell his brother to back off. He basically said to Piss Off. If JFK had stuck to the CIA's Plan for the Bay of Pigs, we would not have had a Soviet Satellite State (Cuba) 90 miles off Florida. Kennedy was too scared about being outed in the 1964 Election to chance it. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY the Russians would have stepped into a shooting war with the US over Cuba. At the least, they would have assassinated some of our people, and at the worst, they would have run into Turkey, and pushed us out of Incerlik. We had nukes there, and we used the base to spy on Soviet Nuke Tests. 
yeah, just read what know_comment has been posting in this thread for context about the "founding" of the Agency. They're basically a country club for Ivy League secret societies, Wall Street bankers and lawyers, etc. With some para-military/mercenary and mafiosi types mixed in for good measure.
Might have even been directly involved\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0NGqYct7MQ/hqdefault.jpg
I'll be honest, my only resource for what the mob can and cannot do is the Godfather movies.  So if you can link a sensible resource that I can check out , I;ll appreciate it.
Maybe. But the fact he was in Dealy Plaza and ascended to the presidency from the CIA is awfully suspicious.
Your posts are bland. 
> A microexpression is a brief, involuntary facial expression shown on the face of humans according to emotions experienced.

I meant for the new people. When I first started lurking here there were 330k subscribers, it's jumped up by 100k in about a year.\n\nI'm going to check in on the Family of Secrets book\n\nThank you for this extra info though!
If that was the only [evidence of his involvement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NlJQJUUqR4), I would agree. But it isn't.
"founded"? Where are you getting that from? I don't doubt that he was connected to the agency, but he was not the founder afaik (there was no single founder, for starters)
I was 5 and I remember it clear as day. I didnt even understand the implications, just that some wild shit was going down on the news. Probably helps my parents were heavily involved in red cross and helped people at our local airports. \n\nRegardless your story is anecdotal and makes no sense in this situation. You were 7. Why would you remember? The issue isnt that a bunch of children cant remember, its that full grown adults who were the leaders of our country cant. If that doesnt seem suspicious to you then that line of thinking is exactly why theyve managed to get so far and undetected. 
Here is what Bush said after that. I found this from the Ford Museum website.\n\n*After a deluded gunman assassinated President Kennedy, our nation turned to Gerald Ford and a select handful of others to make sense of that madness. And the conspiracy theorists can say what they will, but the Warren Commission report will always have the final definitive say on this tragic matter. Why? Because Jerry Ford put his name on it and Jerry Ford’s word was always good.*\n\nIt does make some sense that it shows that Ford was a man that could be trusted and you should trust the narrative, but to mention conspiracy at all at a funeral is strange.
Exactly. I was having this conversation with a friend and he sparked this idea. Also, if you wanted to kill someone in a foreign country on the down low, who better to contract for it than organized crime?\n\n\nNow that we are going down this rabbit hole, when was it that the feds started cracking down on organized crime in the US?
Man in suit? Check.\n\nDark hair? Check.\n\nYep has to be George Bush. /s
remember the mafia had connections in Cuba. i think it might have been Fidel Castro. explains the sanctions that went on for ever until he died.
Duping delight.  He knows something we don't.  
Definitely will check that out. Also, with how powerful of a family they are and were, it really shows how poor of a candidate Jeb was that he couldn't use all that power to even be a contender to the republican nomination.
George Herbert Walker Bush has always insisted he can't remember where he was when John Kennedy was murdered.  [He](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.encyclopediadramatica.se%2Fthumb%2F3%2F31%2FBushcompare.jpg%2F300px-Bushcompare.jpg&f=1) and [his son](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.veteranstoday.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F03%2FW-in-Dealey-Plaza.jpg&f=1), George Walker Bush (Dubya) were both at Dealey Plaza when John Kennedy was murdered.  GHW Bush has plenty of secrets which he hopes will always remain hidden from us.
He was definitely involved.  And that face he made reminded me more of the weird Bush mannerisms than what us normal folk call smiles.
this is the most damning thing.  Anyone else alive at that time remembers exactly where they were when it happened, just like everyone remembers where they were with 9/11.  He's lying.  Why would he lie about it?  He could just say something like "I was on secret CIA thing, can't tell you where"  if he was somewhere else.  But if he claims it was a gov't secret, and more real evidence came out he was at Dealey, then there's a clear tie to some sort of gov't operation and what happened at Dealey.  So he's stuck giving us the lame excuse.
It is odd that he chuckled at that part, however - he is the father of a man who danced like performing chimp during the memorial service for the police officers shot in Dallas last year (Oh shit...DALLAS!)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBf4DCpL1Q4
He wasn't born with swagger. Not his fault. 
Please clap.
It is a known fact that Bush was in Dallas that day.  How many people who were there to see Kennedy do you think would have simply been leaning against the building like that as the motorcade drove past?
His father Prescott Bush also founded the CIA and had many shady dealings during WW2.
Quote from the movie JFK:\n\n"I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level. Could the mob change the parade route? Or eliminate the protection for the President? Could the mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back? Could the mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation? I mean, could the mob get the Warren Commission appointed to cover it up? Could the mob wreck the autopsy? Could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the mob used anything but .38s for hits up close? The mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. Assassins need payrolls, schedules, times, orders. This was a military style ambush from star to finish. A coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings."

This is far beyond the mafia. If you want have the discussion that the mafia is just part of the CIA, I would entertain that thought though.

Fake News. The Clintons were involved in killing JFK, not republicans. You got the wrong political family in here. This is partisan attacking shariablue nonsense
Interesting perspective. First of all, I have long wondered if I have some sort of autism, but I have no idea. I would have to guess I noticed it was weird when 9/11 happened, but I can honestly say I have maybe a two dozen memories from when I was younger than 6th grade, and even after that I feel like I hardly remember anything. People often ask things like "what teacher did you have in middleschool for this class?" I 99% of the time I will look at them like they are crazy for suggesting I would be able to remember that. Maybe I'm just strange.\n\nOn the second point, the laughter, interesting assessment. Personally, I have always felt one may laugh because they are having trouble processing the events, though your answer and mine are not mutually exclusive. It gives me something to think about, at the very least, thanks.
You can't even make this shit up. I mean, I'd like to see a source for that, but goddamn does it sound like a Bush thing to say.
Dupers delight. The amount of delight must be absolutely insane considering the magniute of the duping. If you hooked him up to a lie detector and asked him about JFK the detector would explode.
I agree with that, just didn't agree with the implication that the Bushes were the sole founders. I'd be interested to read more about what you meant by that last sentence, though: \n\n>It was not until the Bill Colby era that this class turned power over to the modern establishment.\n\n(to take a guess: after Colby released the so-called "family jewels" report, political power began to shift to mass media, various govt bureaucracies, academia, etc? Like I said, please elaborate if you don't mind)
Seconded - Family of Nazis would've been an even more apt title.

Remember the Titans when they win the championship.
Can we please come up for a term for the kinds of people who comment like this.  I know its shit posting but these people talk like this in their day to day.  Who talks like this?  You add nothing to this thread and probably nothing to any other conversation.\n\nEdit: wtf reading your comment history, its like different people on the same account.  One helpful and one complete narsacist. 
...need explaining?  no not really.  He is a pretty weird self-righteous dude
It is a really obvious humblebrag.  Don't go to his post history, it's apparent in about 50% of his posts that he is a young man looking to be liked.
Oh...oh.... You dumb :-(
Ken M?
but...Abernathie didn't reincarnate to the new person, he was put in storage and mind wiped...  \n-\nAlso, since their roles are not chosen for them based on their behavior this Buddhist theory is quite a reach.
Carrie-Anne Moss looks strange with a beard.
She should get a cover for that duvet, otherwise it's going to be hard to wash.
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE JEDI ARE EVIL!!!

I feel like it's random.  I have seen some 1k mile boots with little creases and some with mondo creases with no difference in care or wear.  Meh.
AH HA!!!\n\nClever...
I am really liking this EVO X. Didn't know they made a hatch.  Congrats!  Hopefully they continue making this model.  I see potential.

Dude, what are you talking about
Oh, I thought we were still talking about the Kilometer.  Woops!  sorry I must have missed a drop down line from top comment.
Sauce?
tldr Deep state is called "deep state" because that's exactly what it is: a shadow government that's not accountable to anyone. \n\nI understand the OP's concern though, because that's exactly what is happening with all the Flat Earth bullshit that was around here the last few weeks:\n\nWe've all heard about it, but nobody believed it and then out of the blue it's all "flat earth" this and "flat earth" that. \n\nThe Deep State is very real though.
Margaret Thatcher used to call pedos in her government "her pets".
Bush Jr & Sr = deep state CIA higher uppers\n\nMIT (Turkish Intelligence) and Mossad = deep state CIA franchises. Their connection is that they all worked together in Operation Brownstone to gain influence.\n\nI don't see why you and OP can't be both right...
It's not only the leaded gasoline, housing projects and homes for the poor in general are still painted with lead-based paints. This is an enormous public hazard issue with lasting after effects that is the exact type of situation where the government must step in. \n\nInstead they just ignored the problem and made money off of it (for profit prisons etc).
DIY biogass composters are already being used in the developing world, I personally like the idea a lot. Can't speak about the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of this particular composter, but it looks good and I like the small form factor.  \n\n 
So... LED-grown tomatoes it is.
Fucking douchebag, why do people keep using facebook?
Don't believe that Schroedinger's Assange bullshit, it's just another discrediting ploy. \n\nI actually started to believe Assange was a gonner when the first PG emails came out (couldn't read behind the lines) but then I realized that if PG was real, "fake Assange" wouldn't have published them.\n\nBottom line - if their leaks are still hot, Assange is probably OK.
The Floridaman Gene theory: keep doing dumb shit until something good sticks.
How about brewing beer though? Is brewing beer without a liquer licence ethical or not? 
ITM!
The only force that people need to use is that of INFORMATION. Once a critical mass of people who understand how PG/deep state operations work is reached there won't be any need for shows of force. \n\nBeware of people calling you to use physical violence for ANY reason, especially when the people you're supposed to use it against are armed with Iraq war hand-me-down armored vehicles.
PG = r/conspiracy not the_donald. Don just ran with it and then MSM needed a fall guy to pin the "fake news" label on.
> I will give them that we have seen many minor rings busted here and there. But there are never any notable politicians involved.\n\nI like how you are so non-challant tortured little kids regaining their freedom. Do you go through psychevals to work in MMFA? I bet you ticked all the right boxes in yours, complete apathetic denseness must be a priority for your line of work.
/r/shills is one of the best resources for shills on the whole internet and I personally vouch for that subreddit 100%. All conspiracy posters should be visiting that sub every now and again at the very least to read the pinned posts.
> but that would never work\n\nI mean, I think depopulation is a shit idea, but Bill Gates has a whole army of depopulationist shills on reddit. \n\nIs shilling for videogame companies really that far fetched, considering all the things we already know to be true?
Tru dat. One must be pretty damn stupid to believe in this shit, but ever stupider to believe they can convince others of the same.
It's a reddit thing for not influencing people's decissions in fresh threads. Good on you for looking out tho.
Not a shill, agreeing with ya.
Just another heads up, if you want to stay up-to-date on the latest shit monsatan is pulling, read /r/monsanto\n\nI can vouch for that subreddit being GMO-free (currently).
And the primaries, ofc. Don't forget how she also won the primaries fair and square
Downvoted for sourcing your claim, guess it means it was a good one.
I've been promoting startpage since duckduckgo was bought by yahoo. recommended subreddit for the security/privacy conscious:\n\n/r/privacytoolsio\n\n
I wonder if they'll start selling just the batteries themselves, converting old gas guzzlers to EV would help a lot of countries reach acceptable emission levels way sooner than waiting for people to buy new EVs in 10 years from now.
FAE?
My friend, I salute your courage for still going into that retardful place to fish for CTR comments. Fuck 'em and come hang out in r/conspiracy for a while, we got tinfoil and stuff
Basically, and this has been known for a while, what happened is that they skimped on fucking calcium... The water was more acidic and eroded pretty much all the pipes. Now they have to be rebuilt, which is a shit solution. \n\nThey should have kept the water's pH at acceptable levels and *still* planned for the infrastructure upgrade instead of having to do it *after* poisoning tens of thousands of people.

If you guys think conspiracy theories are BS, why are you even here? I like the MIMIC term though, that's a goode one.
Can confirm, those things are fucking terrible. Was given a jar with wicks for our home and both me and my gf had irregular heart palpitations out of the blue in the first week of putting them there. These things were so strong, that leaving the bathroom door even a bit ajar made the whole house smell great... if you don't take the headaches and irregular heartbeats into account.\n\nGot rid of them (just moved the jar outside the house and it's surprisingly strong smelling even outdoors) and lo and behold headaches gone the same day for the both of us. 
911 *is* Pedogate. These child molesters are the exact kind of people who would bring down the twin towers and half the Pentagon, during business hours, in order to start a for-profit war and as a way to hide the misappropriation of trillions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nClintons = Bushes
You ever noticed how Europe and the US have stabilized populations? Same thing is starting to happen in China, that's why they recently revoked the "one child policy".\n\nMamals are programmed to breed more in times of strife, and to breed less in times of prosperity. Breeding more is essentially a biological failsafe for times of strife (at least in mammals).\n\nHonestly, I think the reason that this is very hard to source is that it is knowledge that goes beyond the scope of allowed discourse. It is a well known biological mechanism.
Concur. Watch "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz". Good docu.
That's actually great.
I grew up in WA.Mostly true.
This is not about advertising... Advertisers are not stupid, they know whch sites have real traffic and which ones don't.\n\nFollow the money, this is a reverse-funnel case; they spend money on clickfarms in order to give the impression that they have people visiting their shitty sites, while their *real income* comes from **government propaganda publishing**.\n\n"Advertising scam" is the least of MSM's worries right now, these people are actually stealing from the taxpayer in order to fill said taxpayers' heads with fake news. 
They're outsourcing art to their customer base, maybe they should do the same qith quality control. Set up everyone's account with an "integrity meter AI" or some other futuristic shit and let em have at it. If someone is regularily being off base cull their approving priviledges. 
Agree to disagree, if OP is willing to take the risk who gives a fuck. It's literally "just weed".
Wait, if a student runs a 100w TV all day it's fine, but if he puts a led-powered growbox for 100w he's a bad guy? What if he grows tomatoes but uses two 100w boxes instead? Is he stealing from the TV guys' electricity to feed unethical tomatoes?
Wait, is it unethical because it may tempt unethical people to break into your appartment? How about the beer argument? Also, I'm calling straight up bullshit on you never smoking weed in your dorm room. 
If prostitution was legal there would way less sex crimes. Same goes with drugs (if they were legal, there would be far less prostitutes).\n\n Ruining people's lives for paying 40 bucks to fuck a washed up 35 year old lady of the night is not "fighting human trafficking".
Wait till you see what his "philanthropic" foundation has, his personal wealth is nothing compared to the practically tax-free billions stashed in his foundation.
If you're gonna go the low-effort shitposting route, at least try to be original.
Oh ok I get it. It's ethical to consume illegal drugs in a property you're a guest in but it's unethical to *grow* the illegal drugs? \n\nAgree to disagree.
You could argue Hitler worked for the globalists if you look at it from a "who made a profit on WWII" perspective. 
Project Bluesky more likely? Apparently the "UFO invasion" distraction plan that was going to be projected if SHTF for TPTB is a pretty lame lightshow. \n\nHonestly, this shit is even faker than the Iron Dome...
Nice, I've never even heard of this trick. I love reading about people mythbusting anecdotal stuff.
Rule 10:\n\n>Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, **depending on context**. \n\nYeah, I think you'll be fine.
Best thing about these elections was seeing the neolibs/neocons clearly outline their social circle. The Bushes openly supporting Hillary was the beginning of the end for the whole lot of them.\n\nWhen they scramble, they make mistakes and boy did they scramble these past few years. Good stuff.
The votes clearly said "no more neocon Dems", so it wouldn't make sense to force the new government to follow Obomba's policies. 
I think sometimes it's all about search-engine-results dillution. The more unsourced articles on a given subject, the harder it is to find the sourced ones. \n\nFeel free to add a source yourself!
It's related to 4chan/pol and /r/conspiracy breaking the case wide open IMO. Trump wouldn't/couldn't do shit if the dots hadn't been publicaly connected in front of thousands of people.
Bill Gates has been paying people to vanity-shill for him for years now.

Nah, processed foods full of glyphosate (from soy and corn) and palm oil (cancer enabling) are everywhere by now. \n\nIt doesn't matter what your country cooks, you're bound to come in daily contact with conglomerate produced "foods".
Now imagine what happens to a lead-poisoned person living in a neighborhood where everybody else suffers the same. \n\nNo chance to have a normal life at all for these people.
The people wanted Bernie, not a left-faced neoconservative continuation of Obama's war-fueled police state.
Well, there's a lot of shilling going on on both sides (admittedly more on the Trump side because Hillbot can't get any traction in there) but it's still good ole conspiracy IMO. \n\nThere's some big stuff going down currently, pop in and have a look.
Yeah, I guess that's the real charity right there. Depopulating this poor planet from the people living above their means!
A few months of compost tea waterings can turn most NPK-salted fields to living soil. \n\nVertical growing's where it's at anyway, I think/hope that one day we just use the fields for quinoa and cannabis (tap rooted plants that produce a lot of protein per acre) and the rest of our produce will come from aero/aquaponic LED farms.
It's "tinfoil" you dumb fuck. If you're gonna be a cunt at least try not to be a fool at the same time.\n\n/tips tinfoil fedora
Trump has been in way less contact with Epstein than either Clinton. I've [actually covered thi](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4kn0ma/hollywoodpolitical_elite_child_abuse_scandals/)s in a thread a few months before PG broke out, and let me tell you buddy it was *waayyy* easier to source for the Clintons than Trump. \n\nAnd like /u/ourlegacy said, nobody excluded republicans. We are equal opportunity asskickers in here, unlike you little partisan trolls. 
Yeah, they're halfway there as it is and they're already making millions from user-created content. Doing the same with mods is the natural next step I guess, good on you for spotting the shillin' tho.
You know you're a piece of shit, right?
"Coca Cola is good for you while eating like our grandparents is bad".\n\n Meanwhile the grandparents live to their 90s and newer generations die of diabeetus at 50.
> It is economically prosperous populations that shrink.\n\nExcellent distinction buddy. If we weren't fucking the third world over with bribery and corruption scandals all the time, they'd be healthy enough on their own and their populations would be shrinking due to the absence of strife.
I've been thinking about pizza connections to Colombia these past few days, good write up. Any interesting data from before the 2000s?\n\n DEA and the CIA really fucked the country over back in the 80s and 90s to keep the War on Drugs (c) rolling, I wonder if pizza tactics where used also...
Append your post with the original email link OP, not a time to be lazy. Sub's full of people (both from /r/all and shills). Let the bestest you shine today.\n\nGood research btw
I see, thanks for taking the time to reply.
You wanna dress the sides of your makeshift pot or else it'll mold. Pot walls need to be lightproof so that molds can't photosynthecize.
It's a good idea though, they actually needed to up their marketing game.\n\n
Yeah the shake is the best. 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS NOT A CHARITY BILL GATES IS THE BEST HUMAN IN THE WORLD HE GIVES SO MUCH MONEY TO CHARITY\n\nThere, now we won't be needing the shills.\n\nOK, so the rest of us can all agree that this "charity" organization is just a way for Bill and friends to pay each other's company billions and write everything off as charity, right?
Hitler saved the global banking cartels from the wrath of the people (due to the great depression etc) by blaming "the jews" for the global economic downturn. \n\nWWII was the biggest false flag ever, and millions died on all sides so that the Rothschilds & co wouldn't have to stop milking the plebes.
I was looking for it today at 4pm actually, but it was extra cloudy in the afternoon. If I go crosseyed I'm blaming you btw

Chevron owns the NiCd battery patent (used in most hybrid cars) and used patent encumberance to slow the onset of hybrid and electric cars by almost 3 decades.\n\nTrue scumbags.
Now that you mention it, imagine if that's the reason The Boring Company exists: boring holes from the business hours zone to the strip club zone.\n\nI imagine the residential areas in tidally locked planets are gonna in the warm and cozy afternoon zone.\n\n Elon is lightyears ahead in planning his companies lol\n\n 
This is all about marketing, [this](http://bgr.com/2014/03/14/bill-gates-interview-robots/) is the BG interview that wasn't publicized as much.\n\n>As for what governments should do to prevent social unrest in the wake of mass unemployment, the Microsoft cofounder said that they should basically get on their knees and beg businesses to keep employing humans over algorithms. This means perhaps **eliminating payroll and corporate income taxes while also not raising the minimum wage** so that businesses will feel comfortable employing people at dirt-cheap wages instead of outsourcing their jobs to an iPad.\n\n\nEvery now and then he actually speaks his mind, but like I said, that's never publicized as much.\n\n
"My love is vengeance that's never free" that's from "behind blue eyes".\n\nMy personal conspiracy on the subject is that Townsend has been abused as a kid and that's why he was looking at this shit. Still, the fact that he got caught so easily means he's probably *not* a member of the cabal, just a straggler.
Definitely some mixed feelings going round after reading the post title. Conspiracist in me sees it as a marketing ploy.
Somebody better start creating an open sourced facebook/reddit site that's fully transparent and users vote for the admins and moderators every two years. \n\nIf this is a practicality issue, how would you suggest we solve it?
100% false
Guess the guy didn't learn anything from Hillary's adventures... Mess with the truth and the truth will bite you in the ass.\n\nWL really falls into that "if you don't have something to hide, you don't have to worry about it" mentality.

How did you polinate the flowers? Are they self-polinating or did you do it manually?

They don't care, Soros pays them $15 an hour. They're "just doing their job, man".
Wrong. Am not.\n\nIf you're so keen to entertain the notion the world may be flat, maybe you should also entertain the notion that the shills in the sub would try different types of discrediting processes. 
I've never been up-to-date with pop groups or music, so no.
Do you think reddit makes bank on reddit gold sales?
Every time you see a shill advocating for nuclear fission, remember two things:\n\n1) How much do you trust a big cheapskate corporation to build a reactor that can bring short term profits based on how many corners they cut\n\n2) Bill Gates will profit off of it\n\nEither reason is good enough for me to be against nuclear, the two reasons combined is reason enough to fight the nuclear lobby all day every day.
I mean... Aside from the "you're new here" which both irks me on a personal level *and* is plain [wrong](https://www.reddit.com/user/VLXS/submitted/), I can't really disagree with the rest of your post - except for the time at which you place the whole deal. \n\nFE was never a thing before PG. Sure, a few people discussed it in here, but nobody really gave credence to it or discussed it nearly as much. Besides, it is well known  in here that FE is a debate practice thing and not a "real" conspiracy.\n\nAnyway, at least we agree it's a mindtrap kind of deal regardless of the timing?
"what is that doing to the Ocean?"\n\nDepopulating the fish out of it while at the same time helping big pharma with some long-term profits. There's bound to be a lotta fish-eating cancer to "heal" in the near future.\n\nGood news is if you don't eat fish, you can still get cancer from glyphosate-ridden plant foods *and* animals fed with glyphosate ridden plants. All the bases are covered!
Yeah, not fucking Netflix please.
Remember the old adage that goes "listen not to what I say but watch what I do"? ~~This~~ *Anytime* is a great time to apply it when discussing politics IMO. 
It's not even that, they're just entrapping johns looking to fuck prostitutes (of legal age) right now. Shit's fake as shitfuck.
FE is 100% a discrediting ploy: \n\n - It started appearing overnight in r/conspiracy, a little time after PG originaly broke out\n\n - It started being circulated by complete newcomers, new accounts and other obvious shill accounts with no past history of conspiracy theorizing\n\n - It's a known debate topic/society in CIA recruitment universities \n\n - It's just plain wrong\n\n - There are not enough hours in a day to contemplate all the things we already need to be contemplating, no need to waste time with obvious bullshit. We got bigger fish to fry than disproving some rowboating cunts who think this is a debate practice opportunity.
I get it, but it isn't worth bitching about.  How much money does the US give to Israel everyday?  How much do we spend to keep over 400 military bases around the world?  There is a lot of waste in our government, but people only seem to care about what the television shows on the 5 o'clock news...
Thank you for your courage and in the morning to you.
Lying, or TV news.  They seem to be one in the same.
You seem poorly informed.
That is your idea, not a conspiracy...
That was interesting. They were both dicks at times.
If you think that any company owes you the truth, you are delusional.  They exist to make money.  They publish what they are allowed to publish.  If you think that the editors of these companies don't have rules about what can and cannot be discussed, you are delusional.
Why was this post removed from the front page?
Everyone is wrong, you need to watch more honest television programming, which does not lie BTW.  It was Russia that did this, obviously.

Thanks for understanding.  I live in bum fuck nowhere, crime literally doesn't exist, except for the pedo priest that came from CA and went back to CA after getting caught molesting a little girl.

US tax dollars are supporting it.  Your TV will not tell you this though, so it cannot be true...
You don't believe this trash, do you?
They are informing you with their opinions about what happens, not necessarily exactly what happened.  Is that not more important and opinion pieces?  If there were no viewers for this garbage, it wouldn't exist.
Did you just call him a child for being realistic?
Are you Russian?  Do you live in Russia?  I hope you get your information from a trusted source, because if your source is American media, you are being purposely misled.  Hopefully you understand that.

I don't see a single comment about the insane amount of money we have been spending to kill civilians in sand filled countries that didn't do anything except be placed on American oil interests.

Clinton got a standing ovation for restricting immigration, but the television was OK with this at that time, so the public was OK with it too.

If she causes a scene in a restaurant because you're eating your burger with your hands, just ignore her and let her go on her insane tirade in front of everyone... who are also eating their hamburgers with their hands.

I once had a gas pain so bad it had me doubled over. I thought to myself, if this is anything close to what it's like giving birth, I'm glad that I'm a man.
A number of years ago I was on a commuter flight somewhere in Ohio. I had the window seat and the person next to me in the aisle seat was fat… no, he was huge. At the time I weighed about 145 lbs so I was fairly slender and in good shape.\n \nThis guy not only took up the space in his seat and some of the aisle but also spilled over into my seat... the seat I paid for. I was literally squished up against the window of the plane with his sweaty fat rubbing all over me. It was disgusting. He pretended to sleep.\n \nAt one point the flight attendant walked by and looked at him, then looked at me. She had a sympathetic look on her face. I asked if there were any empty seats I could move to. There was one at the rear of the plane across from the lavatory. She let me move. \n \nI had to put up with the stink of the toilet, the smell of the jet exhaust and the crack-the-whip action of the tail section but it was a lot more pleasant than sitting next to a moist fat man with scaly arms.
My now-ex-wife was being pissy with me for days... the silent treatment, snobby, bitchiness, etc. I finally asked her, "OK, what's going on? Why the silent treatment?"\n\nShe replied, "Well, I shouldn't have to tell you because you should know."\n\nTo which I replied, "Ya know, I can't read your mind so you're gonna have to tell me." Then came the raging shit storm.\n\nShe had a knack for dreaming up problems in her head then moving them into reality. That's why she's an ex.
You must be that kid in the video.
You're both beautiful!
I understand what you're saying. You want to have a nice time with your girl so you are willing to do what needs to be done to keep the peace. But eating a burger with your hands is a socially acceptable, normal behavior. \n\nJust by saying that you "shouldn't ruin a great weekend" you have already fallen into her trap of guilt and blame... she's right, you're wrong. But you weren't wrong. She was the one who was wrong and ruined the weekend, not you.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this kind of behavior will only get worse. Believe me, I know. Been there, done that. These types are never happy and can't be made happy.\n\n[Here's a site](http://shrink4men.com/) that helped me figure out what was really happening in the relationship with my crazy ex. I encourage to read through it. You might (or might not) read about some of the behaviors your girlfriend is exhibiting. Best wishes.
I had perfect vision until puberty when suddenly everything turned blurry. When I finally got glasses my reaction was much like this baby's.
>Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find."[19]\n\nWhat a wretched cunt. I hope she burns in hell.
Awesome!!! Welcome home!
Ha! You are a liberal fattie!!!
Said something about OP worrying about how rich his dad is. The inference being that all OP wanted was his dad's money.
What??? Why? Was she trying to kill you?
I'm 54 years old. I grew up without a microwave oven, or a cell phone, or a computer, or the internet. We had a dial telephone and shared the phone line with four of our neighbors. It was called a [party line.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/62876/10-aspects-old-telephones-might-confuse-younger-readers) We rode around in a station wagon with fake wood paneling and without wearing our seatbelts.\n\nBut yes, we did have cameras back in the day.
Very happy for you! I'm glad that it worked out so well!
Why compare yourself to your dad? Just do your own thing! Do what makes you happy in life.\n\nI listened to my dad way too much. Wish I had ignored him and lived my life the way I wanted.
Well, I love the smell of patchouli. Earthy, musky, heavy.
>During the podcast, he does not appear to condemn similar relationships between children and men.\n\nWhat does this even mean?
Seriously, do chicks like this? I can't imagine getting a date with my pants hanging off my ass.
Pretty cool. And this event took place all within an hour or so.
I love truckers. Meet me at the rest stop.
She sounds like a borderline personality disordered bunny boiler.
Gotta start somewhere.
He's gonna have a headache when he wakes up... if he wakes up.
What??? Are you serious?
>Antisemitic lie.\n\nIt's the truth.\n\nJoshua 1:4-4 ...the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant: 1:2 “Moses my servant is dead. Get ready! Cross the Jordan River! Lead these people into the land which I am ready to hand over to them. 1:3 I am handing over to you every place you set foot, as I promised Moses. 1:4 Your territory will extend from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north. It will extend all the way to the great River Euphrates in the east (including all of Syria) and all the way to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 1:5 No one will be able to resist you all the days of your life.\n\n>In the US, we bulldoze homes that are built illegally.\n\nThe Palestinians were building homes long before the [ashekenazi jews](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-ashkenazi-jews-dna-diseases-20140909-story.html) came along in 1948 and declared those homes illegal.\n\n>Blood libel.

Warring and killing because your god told you to is jihad, no matter the religion.
So let me get this straight... the jews take Palestinian land in 1948 then offer an "extremely fair" two state solution? Why should they accept such a thing? \n\nWhy are the jews entitled to the land to begin with? Is it because they are god's holy and chosen people and he gave them the "promised land"? Is this their only claim to the land... because god gave it to them?\n\nEven Israel's prime ministers admit that they're stealing Palestinian land.\n\n"We must expel Arabs and take their places."\n-- David Ben Gurion, 1937, Ben Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 1985.\n\n"Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves ... politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves...

Oh, I don't know about that. Never forget that "suspected" pizzagate pedophile John Podesta is/was Hillary Clinton's most trusted advisor and was set to become Sec. of State if she were elected. And that her husband, liberal Democrat President Bill Clinton visited convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's private island no less than 27 times.\n\nAdditionally, how may gays do you know who are anti-gay rights?
So many things wrong in this picture.\n\n1. Your toilet is filthy\n2. You left the lid up\n3. There an empty box of mints in the trashcan.\n\nWho eats mints while they're shitting???
Are those pants hanging off his ass? Looks like a clown. Do chicks dig that look?
Church people.
Love my Oregon!!! Thanks for posting!
Just one more reason to not use Facebook.
>FB is holding large chunks of my life hostage\n\nDon't pretend to be a victim. FB is holding nothing of your life hostage. You willingly handed it over.
My mother sent a birthday card to my son. She wrote a nice greeting in cursive. My son tried reading it but gave up and handed it to me saying, "I can't read this!" It made me a little sad.
Yes, I suppose she should be given credit for admitting her bias-ness. But how many men have been unfairly labeled, sent to prison and had their lives ruined because of this bitch? How is she going to fix that? Can't just say "Ooops. My mistake." and walk away.
>...crying my eyes out.\n\nJust a little too much mellow drama.
Keep telling yourself all that shit. You fucks are not God's chosen people and the land is not your "birthright." Go enjoy your psychosis.
I worked with a black man. He was one of my supervisors. During in-service training he gave a short talk about being the only minority person in the community.\n\nShortly after he moved to our cowboy town he decided that he wanted to go watch the rodeo/festival that was going on. He said that while watching the events he looked around and realized that he was the only person of color in a crowd of about ten thousand people.\n\nHis comment was, "I suddenly felt like the pepper flake in a salt shaker." We all chuckled but it illustrated his point of view pretty clearly and I gained a better understanding of what it might be like to be the person who wasn't like everyone else.\n\nTo his credit and to those of the community, he was personable, friendly, funny and pretty well accepted. He had a couple minor confrontations with ignoramuses but he never had to say a word because his white friends took care of business for him.
Jeezus... how many times is this gonna be reposted???
She was cheating on you.
For me, first dates are never dinner dates... just an afternoon coffee date. I don't want to invest too much into someone I don't know or might not like. If we hit it off then perhaps a lunch date for a second date. If that goes well, then a dinner date.
Are you a mind reader? How do you know what these people worry about?
Mint flavored shits are unnatural. 
Maybe not. But the jews pray to a god that tells them to kick the Palestinians off their land, bulldoze their homes, bulldoze their orchards and plow under their fields, and even murder them because... well, you know... the promised land and all that horseshit.\n\nSounds like jewish jihad to me.
It was a stupid thing to say. That's why I called him/her out on it. 
Well then, he needs to be gone!
She's beautiful!
Probably so.
That is absolutely weird. Well, I guess that's why we date... to sort out the good ones from the bad ones.
She was always mad about something and had given me the silent treatment many times before. It was her mechanism of power and control. She wanted me to pry information from her. She wanted me to grovel. She wanted me to beg for forgiveness. So I had gotten to the point where I just didn't care anymore. \n\nI could do nothing right. If I did do it right, it wasn't good enough or should have done it another way. She could never be pleased and would never let me have the satisfaction of knowing that I did well. It was demoralizing, really.\n\nOne time I told her, "Ya know, you don't have to correct everything I say and do."\n\nHer response? "If I see you doing something wrong I'm gonna correct it - like that!!!" [snaps finger, points it in my face]. It was then that I knew we were finished.
That has to be devastating for everyone involved. I can't even imagine... I wish you and your family all of the very best during this very difficult time. Hang in there.
I stopped using Google and began using [StartPage.](https://www.startpage.com/) Works great without the idiotic suggestions.
This is what happens when you're gay and don't support the liberal party line.
Maybe he could have just bought some food for her rather than arresting.
Holy crap! Flashback!!! I had the exact thing happen to me in the first grade! I was always diligent in my work so I was dismayed that she thought I was dishonest. In fact, I didn't even know what cheating was until that moment.\n\nLooking back, I think she was probably a bit of a bitch. I remember the day she washed some kid's mouth out with soap because he said a bad word. Yep, that didn't go over very well with the parents and it traumatized the rest of us little kids.
Decades ago I was in court for a speeding ticket. The case before mine was a young lady who was also cited for speeding. Her excuse? "My feet were tired." The judge gave her a WTF look and fined her.
You mean like Democrat President Bill Clinton saying, "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the--if he--if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not--that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement....Now, if someone had asked me on that day, are you having any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, that is, asked me a question in the present tense, I would have said no. And it would have been completely true."
Deer are one of the dumbest animals on the planet.
That kid is going to have some serious psychological problems.
I once went on a camp-out/fishing trip with a bunch of my friends. Someone had set their phone alarm to go off at 3:30 in the morning. The alarm tone? [A bugling elk!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0UcmAr4_E)\n\nHoly crap! Everyone in the tent instantly woke up!
I never was a fan of Trump. Didn't vote for either him or Clinton. They're both part of the problem.
What does your inane comment have to do with my comment or anything in the article? Are you a fattie? A liberal fattie?
I have no use for Donald Trump, either. If he did it, he needs to be gone.
That's unfortunate and I believe you. But that wasn't my experience there. I had a good time.
So, was Golda Meir wrong when she said, "This country exists as the fulfillment of a promise made by God Himself. It would be ridiculous to ask it to account for its legitimacy." -- Golda Meir, Le Monde, 15 October 1971\n\nAnd aren't the Palestinians just trying to drive back the invaders like Prime Minister David Ben Gurion admitted? \n\n"Let us not ignore the truth among ourselves ... politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country."\n-- David Ben Gurion, quoted on pp 91-2 of Chomsky's Fateful Triangle, which appears in Simha Flapan's "Zionism and the Palestinians pp 141-2 citing a 1938 speech.\n\n\nPerhaps in the name of peace the jews should leave the land, don't you think?
True.\n\nI became disillusioned with the entire political system shortly after voting a second time for GW Bush. Through a series of events my eyes were opened to how we are all being manipulated into hating each other and came to regret that vote. I haven't voted in a presidential election since.\n\nWith the exception of a few, everyone in Washington is corrupt. So, all I can do is sit back, hold on for the ride and hope for the best.
Somebody, give the girl a sandwich!
LOL... I pride myself on my ability to spell. But sometimes one will get away from me. Thank you.
It all began here... \n\nJoshua 1:4-4 ...the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant: 1:2 “Moses my servant is dead. Get ready! Cross the Jordan River! Lead these people into the land which I am ready to hand over to them. 1:3 I am handing over to you every place you set foot, as I promised Moses. 1:4 Your territory will extend from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north. It will extend all the way to the great River Euphrates in the east (including all of Syria) and all the way to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 1:5 No one will be able to resist you all the days of your life.\n\nYou can't go around killing people and stealing their land in the name of God without being hated. Thing is, they're still killing people and stealing their land.
And yet, devils such as Podesta still roam the earth.
Are you my dog? I step outside to get the mail only to come back in to see that he tore the house apart because he had an anxiety attack.
After we divorced my ex-wife had some kind of weight loss surgery. She lost a lot of weight but gained it back. I also saw this with several of my coworkers.\n\nGetting fat is a psychological thing.
I like how the older brother nods his head as the younger brother twirls the crust.
Any attorney would take that case! There's LOTS of money to be made on something like that.
About 18 years ago I bought a Tempurpedic mattress. My life was changed. I have never slept so good.
Or maybe the jews have no interest in peace so they're still killing people and taking their land.
He needs dog lessons.
It's probably denial more than anything. "Nah, I'm not having a heart attack. It's just indigestion."

Well, Clinton is a convicted liar so I will believe the woman before I will believe him.
I don't work in the psych field but I'm pretty sure that my mother and [as things go] my two ex-wives are BPDs.\n\nMy mother has gotten somewhat better but my exes are still f-ing crazy.

They can pretend to be nice for only so long then they can't.\n\n[Here's a site](http://shrink4men.com/) that helped me as I was separating from my second. You might find it interesting
This one got me. Thanks for posting.
> Showing me a picture of another man's penis.\n\nShe actually showed you a picture of another man's penis???
Here's another one for you... My now-ex once told me, "I have abandonment issues so don't ever make me feel abandoned." \n\nOK, so how am I supposed to do that? Read your mind again?
Wow... Who would have ever thought???
I highly recommend! It's really touristy but still amazing to see!
Pretty amazing. It's even more amazing when you're up close and personal.... the roar of the falls, the smell of the water, the trembling of the ground, the beauty of the turquoise river. It's really touristy but it's still a neat place to visit, for sure!
People should be livid that this cult (pyramid scheme) gets tax free status.

This is a critical moment for them.  Most younger people today are not strictly religious, so they are losing the religious right movement that once protected their interests.  I would not be surprised.
I hope he gets it, why not?  If Kissinger can have it, anyone can.  
They lie all of the time, but your average american is oblivious.\n\nAnother way to look at your slavery is this: I ask myself all the time why it should take more than 30 years of your life to simply own a modest home.  You're fortunate if both spouses working multiple jobs can do it today.  Thirty years is a short estimate, since you have to build credit, etc.  Why should it be so difficult to simply put a roof over your head?
Just saying, no one who has studied Jeffrey Epstein and the Lolita Express would get it wrong, especially with links that have his first name in them.
It was the industrialists of the day.  The Birdseye's, Colgates...  other very prominent (oligarch) families of the day.
They even kept water from the Palestinians, yet the world yawns.
Isn't this the same Kennedy from Ring of Fire?  He's been anti vaccine for at least the last decade.  He was the first outspoken person I ever recall hearing.

Oopsie.  They are sorry they've been caught.
Don Lemon was at his best on New Years eve, drunk as shit, and got an ear piercing live on the air.  That was his best reportage yet.  Too bad Kathy Griffin couldn't talk him into a nipple piercing. 
They know full well why they lost, it just isn't in their interests to make it known.  When you are just corporate whores, it's hard to admit that.
Such stupid bullshit!
Isn't it also true that NIST won't release their model they used, to explain the collapse.  Seems they know it's bullshit, if they don't make it publicly known.
People also wear brooches.
Do you feel it's possible pizzagate was intended to cloud Assange's disappearance?  The original FBI supposed pedo-image thing was discovered right about that time in October, iirc.  Then, right after, nothing from Assange for a long time.
I hate her, but this is BS.
Probably lots of practice.  It ultimately is why they exist, and their profession demands being a good bullshitter.
I hope it was followed in Iran with uproarious laughter.  Never trust a zionist.

Yeah, that thing that "Daniel Epstein" (unsearchable on reddit's crap site) owns.
Yes.
No, that was you.  You've hastily put up a lot of links, and probably barely read anything about the Lolita Express.\n\nNo one forgets [this pricks name](http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4915242.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Jeffrey-Epstein.jpg) after just an hour of study.
Exactly.  It fills me with some happiness that someone else recognizes that.  Look at how much life we really miss being wrapped up in jobs we don't like, just to put a roof over our head.  I think that's why movies like Fight Club aren't really talked about very much.  There are some profound moments about consumerism, capitalism in that movie that don't benefit the machine.
The man practically lives in a royal palace, but people think he's an every man.  Good rich man's trick.
Yes, that is what I'm just saying.  
...or else.
Just think of the world we could have if people could study their passions.  It would be a Renaissance of creativity and invention.
It's pretty shocking that Brokaw admits handing his balls in a velvet box to Nancy Reagan.  In all these years since, it hasn't even occurred to him that this was a bad thing.  Dore is right, he's just an ascot wearing motherfucker.  Worthless corporate lackey. 
Bill Kristol, the definition of an oligarch.
"Globalists".\n\nCall them what they really are, zionist israelis.
Not everyone.  Ugh, that guy.
Just like our CIA, never believe a single word from Netanyahu.
That scary Efferdent smile was nauseating.  
I hope they continue to hit themselves in the head with a hammer.  Many are waking up to the fact we have a ruling class, as throughout history.  Until some oligarchs pay a high price, it will continue.  There is a reason people in France still have very good social services.  Even 200 years later, people remember to fight for them.  Our liberal elites are all on the payrolls of the ultra wealthy.  It's so blatantly obvious now.  Look at someone like Corey Booker.  He just sold out the public for big pharma, and no backlash that I can see.
Trump is not our savior, that is true, but I am happy every fucking day since the election that Clinton isn't in for many, many reasons.
Israel wags this dog.\n\nThis is a multi-part series that was wiped from the Fox news archives, and aired shortly after 9/11.

Oops, downvoted by a Lemon lover!  I suppose it was just too much truth for them.  http://nypost.com/2017/01/01/don-lemon-downs-shots-gets-ear-pierced-in-bizarre-broadcast/
They needed to "elevate" who they thought they could never lose to.  That's how horrible Clinton was.  Totally unlikable, even if someone wasn't familiar with her many corrupt acts.\n\nIt is really hilarious given all of the star-power and the entire media behind that bitch until the end.  The night before in philly was particularly hilarious.  Even with the Clinton power house behind her, they just couldn't get the most untrustworthy piece of garbage candidate ever into office.  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Even more fascinating is that his debilitating disease set in, in only his last few hours in office.  Truly.  And more fascinating than that, that someone could defend one of the biggest pieces of garbage that humanity ever shat out.  Truly, truly.
I've always liked this example: In the 1950's you could buy a dining room table and chairs [like this,](http://retrorenovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1950s-dinette-500x338.jpg) and it would last your entire life, even through having children.  Perhaps even more important, it also cost a reasonable amount of money.  Many that were taken care of still look this good today.  Take an equivalent amount of money today, and you'd be lucky to get some piece of crap from a Home Depot that you have to put together yourself, and fall apart in a few years.

They are not interested in justice.  They are interested in quotas and making a profit.
Ever notice how especially in recent decades Disney is all propaganda?  By that I mean, we are told good things come to those who wait, play by the rules, that we are all super special, that evil will not prosper and will get what they deserve... How to be good consumers.  I could go on.  It's always been that way, but it's now pretty insidious.  
Lol
Nah, you just stank up the place.  AJ is just a sweaty embarrassment, not even half as bright as Hicks was.
Please be photos of Wolf in nipple clamps and ladies garments at a massage parlor. 
Okay, Wolfie at a Turkish sauna for the elite, including all the big bankers like Jamie Dimon and other wall streeters in an all male orgy?\n\nYeah, if Marco Rubio can get away with his bubble party, they can get away with anything.
My level of surprise is low.
If you want it to be taken seriously, and later able to be searched for-- you need to fix it.  Just delete and re-submit.\n\nWe both despise JEFFREY Epstein, so you may want to do this.\n\nPS, and also read about Lolita Express.\n
If any country should be bombed by the USA, it should be Israel.  But instead, "we are led like a donkey by Israel", (paraphrasing Zbigniew Brzezinski.)
And what would that benefit Hicks?  Hicks was on his way to being the greatest comedian ever if he hadn't died at a young age.  Give that up to be big, fat loudmouth?  
"outside"?
It's a title well-earned.  FUCK CNN.  It's a garbage channel that no one should watch.
Can't argue with any of this.  Great rant.
Reich is a Clinton sycophant, and knows that Clinton's time as SOS and Obama's drone program have much to do with the migrant "crisis" that is created for zionist benefit.
I feel exactly the same.  
McCain is always ready to send other people off to war.  He is the biggest piece of shit in congress, he and Lindsey.  Always ready to allow american blood to spill for Israel also.

I wonder if the seed packet aisle was also hit.  Someone with a little know how can grow lettuce big enough to eat in only a couple of weeks, that would then allow you to crop for months until it bolts.  In containers on a porch... anywhere for almost zero cost, and for about 8 months out of the year with a cold frame.
He's a good little lap dog.  \n\n"America stands with Israel."  How dare he say this?  No, after decades, the parasite has finally been identified.  That parasite is destroying this country from within.
I remember the first year being pretty good, especially the one on civil forfeiture.  But not long after, he turned the propaganda up to 11, and I stopped watching.  No regrets.
Colbert has really changed, and not for the better.
> It is your vitriol which I find problematic,\n\nI'm so sorry your delicate sensibilities were deeply injured here.  \n\nThe fact that you give the Clinton criminal network a complete pass means we have nothing further to talk about.  You think I'm low class because I used spicy language, (poor baby!) and I think you're low class because you're an apologist to some of the worst people currently alive. \n\nNow bugger off.  By the way, opinions are like assholes, everyone has got one.
I'm soooo happy to have offended you.  Clinton lost because her corruption oozed out of every pore, and even uneducated people could sense it.  \n\nOf course you're an idiot who automatically assumes I voted for Trump, just because I didn't vote for Hillary.  I didn't, but you have assumed that, because you're an assuming dumbass who only sees black and white.\n\n>It is healthy to channel all your worldly anger at a woman though...\n\nThe Clinton's are horrible human beings.  Here you sit defending horrible human beings as if you know them.  How about you read some wikileaks about how they bilked millions from the devastated people in Haiti?  You won't though, because you don't ever want to learn the truth.\n\n>You sound like a really, really nice guy to be around. \n\nThis isn't about me, but when you start your argument this way, again, it makes it clear you've got nothing to say.  You seem like someone I would be repulsed by as well, dear.  I hate stupid people.
Imo, it was a guilty conscience but more so about making sure there was a sense of sympathy for him.  I think he also may have avoided the swearing in.  Still remember the brooding anger of Dubya.  He looked like a child told to go to detention.
Amazing.
Never-ending BS from this user.  I wonder why.
The way he bulges his eyes out when he says ~~"kissing Goblins"~~ is hysterical.  Someone posted this here, and I can't thank them enough.  This is art.\n\nedit: I meant when he said "in bed with the goblins."
Meanwhile, the establishment regularly sends every goddamn representative they possibly can on a brain-washing, ass-kissing mission to Israel. 
Hey Hillary, you shouldn't have shit all over the "Bernie-bro's" after all?\n\nI remember very well how vain the campaign was to think they didn't need to embrace them.  Turns out she shouldn't have alienated anyone, darn.  Hope your good friendship with Wasserman Schultz was worth it.

I really don't want to think about McCain being fingered by Trump.  Zerohedge, get your shit together.
What he won't say, is that we are the terrorists for Israel's benefit.
This really began with the BDS movement.  Israel is making free speech a thing of the past.
It's strange alright, but I'm not disturbed.  Instead of being ominous or whatever they were trying for, they just look like a bunch of dumbasses.  It's like they said to themselves, "how can we look evil on a Dollar Tree budget"?
Keep digging!!!
I would link something, but it's actually a little difficult to find.  Google Marco Rubio + bubble party, and you'll find out some fun stuff after a bit of searching though.  Basically, he attended a huge gay party/bash in Florida when he was younger, photos included.  I forget all of the fun details though.
On the wrong account?
You know, you are better off without them.  Alienating their base is what they are doing best right now.  Fuck them, leave the party and join as independent.  The average democrat that is still in the party is an idiot, willfully ignorant fools.  I will never align myself with the democratic party again after Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other bullshit they pulled.  The two party system has revealed itself to be a farce.

Yes, I can show you how this is done.  [Human waste is handled like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=portable+toilet&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiik46e6ZzSAhVH9WMKHRyHBMUQ_AUICigD&biw=1919&bih=888) and [Garbage is handled like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=large+garbage+containers&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH-bHg6ZzSAhVW12MKHcx7DewQ_AUICSgC).  And no, it doesn't cost much.  This is the way it's done around the world.  Now, you don't get this in your case where you deliberately pick a remote area and nobody knows you're there and you are setting up camp without any plan for waste or garbage disposal, and what you personally do is not something that any government has a responsibility for, but I'm not talking about what you personally do, in any case, am I? 
When US warships are 12 miles off the shore of Russia it's not news.  
I'm not knocking the guy or the success he's personally had.  I'm just sayin' that he's got himself in an extremely unusual, and good, place.  If you make $10 million a year, and if you have been living in Oregon since 2004, and if you're not worth $150 million just yet, well, maybe that number is $20 or $30 million too high.  But there's always this year and next year, and hell, the guy is 20 years younger than I am and I expect to live another 30 years myself.\n\nOh, and my software runs on Linux/Gnu, so he's helped make me happy and successful, too.  He's probably made more people rich than anyone else who ever lived, and he's just getting started.

I've been complaining about NPR for a long time.  What was going on there was obvious to me.  Who did you take your orders from?
I strongly recommend that you don't presume you need to tell me what to read and how to interpret what I read.
You know, I read just yesterday that cities all around the country are waiting for the RNC and the DNC to reimburse them for all the extra police protection that the cities provided for them.  Sometimes governments provide services that they consider to be essential for which they don't get paid as they wish.  
His shortcomings have, like all previous Presidents, rapidly become glaringly obvious.  There are 100 different ways to say this.  I like the expression 'all hat and no cattle'.  He's had no training for the job and doesn't have ten minutes in a week that he is even willing to devote to actually training for the job.  Four more years like the last four weeks is all we have to look forward to.  It's been so long since we had a real President here in the USA.  The Russians are very fortunate to have Putin now - and I think they know it.
Trump has often had to back down in his short political life; he's used to it and we will see a lot more of him doing it.
At what point did it all go so wrong, I wonder.  I long ago stopped wondering IF it had all gone so wrong.
All these people who 'hate' Putin; I think there's something wrong with them, with the way they view the world, with the way they interpret events, with the way they ignore the obligation he has to the people of Russia and the way they ignore what the people of Russia think of him.
DU is nasty shit.  The USA just can seem to do anything right.
Golly, you like to preach.  I think we all know what downvoting is for.
Very much appreciated.  I didn't even think to ask wikipedia.  It's nice to know that at least one person around here has his head screwed on.
The Constitution of the USA provides for The Congress to make and amend laws, and for The President to Enforce those same laws.  There is no authorization in The Constitution of the USA for the President to make and amend laws.  A President who spends his days focused on creating 'Executive Orders' and other pursuits than enforcing the laws of Congress is, by definition, not doing the job he took an oath to fulfill, a job which only he can do.

You're singing quite a different tune with this comment than you are with the submission's title.  If you want to simply piss on Russia and it's people, maybe you can better do that here, then, because over there people (and I would be one of them) would expect you not piss all over them by asserting something so totally fucking ridiculous as the idea that Russia has enslaved America.

If this is true then I will conclude that Michael Moore has nothing to say to me - ever again.
Well, yes, but she basically hard wired his psyche to her using her sexuality.  And he was 12, not 14.  Yes, they're married, but she stole his childhood and he will struggle the rest of his life with the serious psychological and social conflicts with which she permanently burdened him.
Why on earth would the Zionists want peace?  They can't expand their borders during peace.  They can't expand the territorial footprint which provides them with access to resources like natural gas and water during peace.  They can't expand their airspace and territorial waters during peace.  They can't keep stealing land from the Palestinians during peace.  They can't keep destroying Palestinian homes, businesses and farms during peace.  They can't attack Gaza, Syria and Lebanon with their military during peace.\n\nWhy on earth would they want peace?

The kid was 12.  She was fuckraping him again and again.  He has nightmares.  He is still in the psychological and social prison in which she placed him.  What else was he going to do except marry her because she had two babies from what she did to him?  Bill Maher's view of her behavior is that "She was in love with him".  The kid was 12 years old!  Maher doesn't venture his view of the boy's behavior because he isn't even thinking of the boy!  There are a lot more 'facts' about this than the fact that she's out of prison and they're married - a lot more.
He impressed me, you may be sure.
And they like to call this a 'conflict'.
When I'm speaking about social justice and equality for Palestinians these social justice warriors are nowhere to be found.

This should be good - should be fun to watch.\n\nActually, we've got several California companies that are making more money these days than they even know what to do with, and none of them are stepping forward to help the government that gives them freedom to make all that money.  We're talking more than a trillion dollars of untaxed profits if we bundle three or four of these companies together: Apple, Oracle, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, et cetera.  And I'm talking companies that are either headquartered there or have a very significant administrative presence there.
I would have voted for Bernie.  My newest son in law (to soon be) lives in Burlington.\n\nDonald saved us from Hillary.  I'll always be grateful.

How could any informed person not be?\n\nOh, and I cringed, watching Obama doing nothing when Gaza was (and is) under attack.  Let's see if anything is different under Trump.
He's a fool.  I don't have a cat but if I did I wouldn't trust him to change my cat's litter.
Over the years I can't even begin to guess how many times I have had smug pedantic types lecture me by reminding me that ***"The President knows things YOU don't know, so shut the fuck up"***.\n\nAnd now I know that The President gets his facts by, for example, misinterpreting a vague generalization that Fox News makes about life in Sweden as a real event happening now.
A handful of you guys want to make this about the people who have traveled there to protest the pipeline and you want it so bad that you won't even think about the pipeline as an issue, about the issues surrounding it which involve the rights of people.  You don't seem to be very 'American' to me.
***"If Trump stops importing Saudi oils,he might expect the destruction of US Economy” Khalid al-Falih, chairman of Aramco and Saudi Aramco Oil Minister, told the Financial Times in Marrakesh.***\n\nLooking forward to your tweet on this, Donald, if you REALLY care about the people of the USA, but if you really only care about yourself, then just pretend this bastard didn't actually say this, ok?
I will simply reiterate for you.  There is no excuse for the Government of North Dakota and the USA allowing an ecological disaster to unfold there.  It would be very easy for these governments to acknowledge the Constitutional rights of everyone there and to do what it takes to keep things from getting out of hand.  The cost of doing this is trivial and is not really an issue.

Executive Orders are neither Constitutional nor unConstitutional...  \n\nYes, the point I made, hence the caveat that every President ignores at their own peril.
Donald Trump screams at us how he's going to keep our country safe.  Well, it sounds so good to some people when he is screaming this but his screaming did not keep [these two girls safe](http://www.theindychannel.com/news/thousands-of-people-say-goodbye-to-two-murdered-delphi-teens) and it never will keep anyone safe.  He will keep on screaming, though, and some people will buy his screaming, but the truth is that he hasn't done anything yet except scream about keeping us safe, and he never will be able to keep us any safer by screaming, because he's only doing it for the votes.  and that's the truth.

I was a young liberal once.  I was at the '68 Democratic Convention in Chicago.  You can read about that.  I'm not young anymore and I don't even pretend that liberal/conservative, left/right, labels have any usefulness anymore, either.  Regarding onesself as liberal (or conservative) these days has no meaning at all.  It's what one does every day with one's life which is the only thing that matters.  It's rather telling that 'Russia Today' and 'RT' are more accurate at reporting the true dynamics shaping life in America than are any of the mainstream media are.

A two-state solution was never going to be possible.  The Zionists gambled that they would be able to chase all of the Palestinians away but that gamble has failed - was always doomed to fail - and now the Palestinians must become fully equal citizens of Israel and Israel will not remain a Jewish state.  Israel cannot endure as a racist apartheid state which denies human rights to those who are not Jewish.

There are tens of thousands of laws enacted by Congress so your assertion that nothing (ever) gets done is, of course, proven on its face to be false.  There are many judges in the USA who are already refusing to adhere to Executive Orders on Immigration because the Constitutionality itself of Executive Orders is very much in question.  Again, Trump's obligations under The Constitution of the USA are to enforce existing laws, and he has no authorization under it to 'get things done' by assuming the role of one-man-maker-of-laws.

Yes, it's true.  Ukraine as a country is only something which was done when the U.S.S.R. ceased to exist in the early 1990's.  The people of Ukraine are basically Russian and embrace their Russian ethnicity, culture and heritage.  When the government allows them their right to self governance they have sometimes chosen to align themselves with Russia rather than Ukraine.  You see this in the photo and you see it in the refusal of the people in Donbass, Luhansk and some other parts of Ukraine to have their right of self governance taken from them by the politicians running Ukraine in the last 3 or 4 years.

I suppose some Americans thought that we would all somehow win if Hillary became President and some Americans thought we would all somehow win if Donald became President.  I thought that we would all lose when either one of them became President.  Alas, the last four weeks have given me the solid assurance that I was right.  I place plenty of blame on the two 'leading' political parties and on the American people for embracing them rather than embracing the spirit and the protections of The Constitution itself.
People like to have opinions, and everybody has one, but the truth is that a person doesn't need to have an opinion about everything, and it's better to not have an opinion about a subject one doesn't have enough knowledge about than to have an opinion which cannot be supported by a knowledge of the facts and the history, and by a bit of genuine wisdom.
I recall in the early and mid 60's when revolutionary laws were passed in the USA which dealt with racial equality.  This happened because The President(s) worked with Congress and because the Supreme court had laid down the groundwork to make enforcement of the laws very straightforward.\n\nThere is no precedent in the USA for judges to be fired for upholding The Constitution of the USA.  There is no precedent in the USA for regarding an Executive Order to be either equivalent to, or superior to, Congressional law.  You may opine, but the way it works in the USA, the way The Constitution of the USA provides the tripartite government we have, is quite firmly established and has been proven to work quite well.  The recent prevalence of a two party political system has no basis in The Constitution and is certainly not prohibited by The Constitution, but it is quite a different phenomenon in all its manifestations than is the tripartite nature of the US Government.
Linus is a much more confident fellow than he used to be back before he was making $10 million a year, worth $150 million, and living at Dunthorpe, Lake Oswego, Oregon.

Obama made a lot of mistakes, but one of the worst, if not THE worst, was appointing Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, then letting her dictate US foreign policy.  To that extent he also caused the current situation in Africa.
The way I see it, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving - a gift forced upon us by Hillary Clinton and her international criminal cabal.  \n\nThe people running the USA and the people who support them are dedicated to spreading democracy as its done in the USA to the rest of the world.  It's easy to see why the rest of the world thinks that the last thing they need is democracy the USA way.

They're good mythologies of the truth. I would say life is a category of fire rather than it being the other way around. Life is a fire-form.\n\nTrees are just as dependent on the animals, fungi and life forms of the forest as the other life forms are dependent on the trees. Some people see them as unmoving ancients but they're really closer to being our siblings(or, I guess, distant cousins, but we still share the same house). So their need to manipulate us in some way would make sense, and maybe they do love to hypnotize us in order for us to notice them, or get mesmerized by them.

Han følte han ble kutta av i starten. Du ser han ikke, men det er han som tuter når traileren skal innpå veien fra rampa i starten.
That looks like a joke to me.

It's not supposed to be an illusion as this gif is from a joke video.
conifers and broadleaves actually build up on opposite sides of the core when they're in steep hills. While broadleaves tend to have the core on the downhill side, conifers' cores are on the uphill side, kind of like the conifer reaction wood pushes(compression wood), while the broadleaf wood pulls(tension wood). 
They asked you to be more spesific, not keep being vague.
This phenomenon he is talking about happens in the lower part of the trunk, in order for the tree to straighten itself out towards the top, so where the tree is straight, the rings are concentric. \n\nReaction wood happens in the actual bend, not the whole tree.
So, Milo vs. Breivik, basically...

Actually, it's a common misconseption that grass will begin to cut itself just because it takes a liking to emo music. In the vast majority of cases, it's the other way around. Cutting itself comes first. Emo music might even work against its intent here, giving release to the grass making it cut itself with less frequency. I would not recommend it. Instead try blasting One Direction on repeat, and hopefully it will try killing itself before you do.\n\nedit: a letter

On the one hand, why does it matter what the CIA and the FBI say about anything? Both organisations have a history of lying to serve their own agenda. \n\nOn the other hand, why wouldn't Russia try to influence the election in any way possible, when one of the candidates pose more of an existential threat to them than the other? Leaving that to fate would be completely irrational.
This was a political ideology that resonnated with more people than just the Germans. There was a substantial nazi party in Norway, and many of them were members of the police, which helped in arresting and handing over enemies of the state to the occupying authorities.\n\nNorway even had its own prison camps, from where a few thousand people would be deported to the concentration camps in Poland or Germany.

He was talking about terror attacks caused by immigration, pulling an event supposedly happening in Sweden out of his ass...\n\nIs the consensus that he's talking in codes, now? This is what people mean when they're talking about a post truth society.
Or gravity.
What I meant is maybe something covered it earlier over a period of time, and when it was removed, the bark had changed underneath it. \n\nAnother speculation would be that somebody removed the outer layers of bark a while ago(a couple of years, maybe) and it then grew back more coarse.

I hate the term "SJW". Why do people insist on using it? It's a label nobody identifies with. In other words, anything you say about SJW's is a statement about straw men. It does nothing to bring us closer to the truth, and instead contributes in keeping public discourse a mindfield of worthless rhetorical points.

Exactly, and to add to this, when researching always try to find primary sources on the topic. If you can't find primary sources, cross-reference multiple secondary sources that have a differing bias so you see both sides of the story. That way, you can come to your own conclusion of what actually transpired, rather than regurgitating some media outlet's agenda

This isn't about left or right, republicans or democrats. Selling weapons to anyone has been the United States' foreign policy forever.

I'm just saying don't take the report at face value, it could be exaggerated to buttress the current narrative that Assad is literally Hitler and the USA needs to goto full boots on the ground war in Syria. I do not want another ground war in the middle east\n\n> Additionally, you can't use a biased source to rip on another organization about how they are biased.\n\nThis is an interesting point: NGO-Monitor states that it's focus is to, \n> End promotion of "politically and ideologically motivated anti-Israel agendas" by certain NGOs\n\nThis stated focus brings me to the question, isn't it counter-intuitive for NGO-Monitor to be used as a source to discredit a report against one of Israel's enemies, Syria? \n\nSo I'm using a pro-Israel source to prove a story (the story could be construed as pro-Israel in terms of geopolitics because it makes the Assad Regime look bad) shouldn't be taken at face value.

Here's another, much better article: http://www.globalresearch.ca/fake-news-and-crimes-against-humanity-amnesty-international-admits-syrian-saydnaya-report-fabricated-entirely-in-uk/5573847\n\nI do admit that it is fishy the government won't let Amnesty in though. 
We are in a proxy war in Syria, Russia is one of the nation states acting against the deep state's interest in that theater. So, technically, yes we are 
This is semantics but stable and liquid are sort of what I intended when I said strong. Just didn't have the right words\n\nBut to your point, yes the entire world economy is based on fractional reserve banking, aka debt based currency that enriches the central banks that issue the money out of thin air and impoverishes the common people that have to deal with the inflation that comes with printing money with impunity.\n\nThere is 3 times as much debt in the world economy as there is actual GDP.\n\nOne might be inclined to say the entire international banking system currently in place is just one giant ponzi scheme...
But then who will receive the blame for our politicians' incompetence?\n\nTHINK OF THEIR FEELINGS 
> Now... it's a little more plausible.\n\nIt is an unequivocal truth that it is happening
I agree that he has exhibited those tendencies, but he has yet to sign a Patriot Act or another NDAA. Those are literally fascist actions. I guess one could interpret the Travel ban as fascist?\n\nMy point is that if someone is going to call him a fascist, they better lump Obama and Bush in there too. Obama is extremely charismatic, an articulate and eloquent speaker so he was able to charm most people. Bush just played stupid (or maybe is actually stupid). Trump conducts himself (meaning his mannerisms, speech etc.) in a way that mirrors that of a Mussolini \n\nI really hope he doesn't turn out to be one, but I won't be surprised if he does.
It wasn't a mistake for the war profiteers who made the decision. Cheney and Halliburton made a fortune
I believe they likely are facts, I've just been trained to take everything with a grain of salt when I know how these facts are used to push forward an agenda. \n\nYou don't see the legacy media (FOX,CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS) banging the war drums to march us towards battle with the Saudis, do you? (that was honestly just a curious question, I haven't seen it)
I was being sarcastic...  
By no means do I doubt that there are atrocities occurring left and right in Syria, I'm just trying to point out this is part of the manufacturing consent stage of our propaganda in order to get is more involved in the war. \n\nMy points were not very clear, my apologies
I like seeing the mental gymanstics people go through to call Trump a fascist dictactor/literally Hitler when he's only been in office for like 3 weeks. Obama Signed the NDAA, twice, and Bush signed the PATRIOT Act. \n\nBefore people freak out, Trump may very well turn out to be a fascist authoritarian, but it was Bush, Obama and Congress that gave him the means.
Intuitively, the dollar staying strong is what helps it remain the world reserve currency. If the value of the dollar went to shit international banks would look for an alternative currency with less volatility. Banks don't like risk. So the powerful petrodollar enables the U.S. to maintain it's global hegemony. \n \nSource: majored in Economics

Thanks, I will look into it!\n\nI made this post because I see constant discussion of "why don't we have Saudi Arabia on the travel ban" or "the Saudis are the real terrorists!'- Well here is why they remain protected.\n\nAlso, countries like Syria, Lybia, and Iraq get attacked because they try to sell their oil in currency other than $$$
In the spectrum of left vs right, yes it does benefit the right for political purposes. I just think it's silly to divide yourself from others because of their ideology. \n\nBoth sides have many valid points. When we divide ourselves rather than focusing our scrutiny on the people in power we lose.\n
First of all, just want to say that I think your critique of the article is fair and accurate. As I've said in earlier posts, I want to see both sides of the story. Just to be clear, I'm not denying that these events have taken place. \n\n\nLet me give you a little background on my thought process though if you don't mind... I've been subscribed to NY Times for about three years while also being a regular NPR listener and during that time I've also tried to read the WSJ and watch Fox every now and then to balance my news intake. I started to notice in the primaries that there was a coordinated effort by almost all outlets to discredit everyone who wasn't Hillary Clinton while at the same time, never addressing any of the valid criticisms of her.  \n\n\nAs a naturally skeptical person, this started to bother me so I tried to figure out why Bernie wouldn't get any air time (I'm a registered Independent in the south... P.S. I voted for Kasich in the Republican primary). Then I started to follow the money. I realized that [only a handful of corporations controlled 90% of our media](http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) and that the U.S. was ranked [41st](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/475017281/u-s-ranks-41st-in-press-freedom-index-thanks-to-war-on-whistleblowers) in press freedom. I also found out that most of those corporations donated to HRC's campaign. \n\n\nThen right after these revelations the DNC leaks and Podesta emails came out and I read ~~all~~ most of them. Though many of the emails were mundane, there were quite a few disturbing ones. It became readily apparent to me that there was a concerted effort by powerful political and media elites to CONSPIRE to elect HRC. Many of these so called respected outlets pushed fake news- [apparently it's illegal to read wikileaks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L402AOasAYg)\n\n\nWhat does this have to do with Syria? During the time of these leaks the HRC campaign was pushing for a no-fly zone over Syria and at the same time, we saw in the emails that [HRC knew that Saudi Arabi and Qatar were clandestinely funding ISIS while her foundation received millions from both countries after she approved giant weapons deals to those countries](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774)\n\n\nSo, considering the fact that the Obama administration was not able to garner support for boots on the ground they needed to use indirect methods to topple Assad. Cue the "moderate rebels".\n\n\nNow what does this have to do with our discussion of the validity of the Amnesty report? Because I know that there is a vested interest by elements within the federal government to go to war with Syria, I am extremely skeptical when I see a report like this parroted by the legacy media.\n\n\nI, for one, don't want my tax dollars paying for cruise missiles to deliver freedom^TM to the Middle East. Sorry for the diatribe, just felt it necessary to explain myself. Cheers\n\nEdit: punctuation and some words

My thoughts exactly
I think it was FDR's secretary of war or someone similar to that who stated unequivocally that we had to continually destabilize the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region so that we could control the vast resources underneath the ground.\n\nThey aren't so direct these days with their rhetoric, now we're delivering freedom and democracy to the region in the form of cruise missiles
The hypocrisy is mind numbing 
Ultimately, you may be correct but until that day comes I am going to keep my faith in humanity. Good luck to you\n\nEdit: meant for this to be the reply to your comment below, oh well
The Iraq war was more Darth Cheney's work IMO, Bush Sr surrounded Jr with all of his Neocon buddies and Dubya was just along for the ride. Mission Accomplished!
Well she did want to set up a no-fly zone in Syria, which would have led to direct conflict with Russia rather than the proxy war in which we currently find ourself

Follow the money. They aren't impartial-http://www.ngo-monitor.org/reports/breaking_its_own_rules_amnesty_s_gov_t_funding_and_researcher_bias/\n\nFor the record, I'm not saying they are lying, just that they have motive to do so considering their funding. Always follow the money\n\nEdit: Also want to make it clear that I'm not excusing the actions of Assad.\n\n
I care.
The ponzi scheme I'm referring to is the fact that every time the Federal Reserve (Independent Central Bank) prints money, it loans it to the US government at interest. Our income taxes pay off the interest of the loans to the federal government, so in this unsophisticated description, the citizens of the U.S. are effectively subsidizing the Federal Reserve.\n\nApologies for my thoughts being disjointed, at work.\n\nEdit: Here's a quote from Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh- \n> To cause high prices, all the Federal Reserve Board will do will be to lower the rediscount rate..., producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market; then when ... business men are adjusted to these conditions, it can check ... prosperity in mid career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest. It can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate, or cause violent fluctuations by a greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change, either up or down. This is the strangest, most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any Government that ever existed. The system is private, conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money. They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage, They also know when to stop panic. Inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control finance
ISIL toppling Assad suits U.S. geopolitical interests, not necessarily them just existing. This article does a decent job of discussing one of the many geopolitical reasons we are meddling in Syria's affairs: http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74\n\nI'm just sick of seeing my tax dollars go towards the killing of people all over the world.\n\nEdit: Russia did a lot of damage to ISIS  http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/633607/Islamic-State-Russia-airstrikes-100-ISIS-targets-day-Britain-Brimstone-missile\n\nBut yes it is more than a Civil War, more of a proxy war between Syria, Russia, Iran vs US, Saudi Arabia.

> The Petrodollar system is not the reason the dollar is the reserve currency. Saying that confuses cause and effect.\n\nI agree with your point, but we have to maintain the petrodollar now that our currency is fiat in order to keep it stable and liquid. Hence why we don't attack Saudi Arabia even though their style of constantly abusing human rights has been used as casus belli for the U.S. to attack countries all over the world.\n\n> Demand for U.S. dollars for risk and store of value reasons is separate from transactional demands. Transactional demands (like paying for oil) only increase liquidity and price stability, not price itself. They theoretically provide some seigniorage, but that effect is infinitesimal.\n\nThe Federal Reserve profits, not the U.S. government. "This note is legal tender, for all debts, public and private"\n\n> The dollar's role as a reserve currency is fundamentally incidental and unimportant compared to every other factor in the economy. Estimates of the total value of the dollar acting as a reserve currency are consistently under one-half of one percent of GDP.\n\nI don't doubt you are correct here.
I think he was playing dumb too, I've read articles from former aides of his that said he was sharp as a tack in meetings and such
Yes, because of the context and its intended agenda. By broadcasting this report to all of the american public they (MIC, congress) are trying to elicit outrage (shouldn't be hard because this is a travesty) so that the American public will be geared up for war. \n\nThere are plenty of other war crimes and atrocities that occur all across the world that aren't broadcasted full bore to the American  public, like the daily executions from our "ally" Saudi Arabia because they don't fit into the American power structure's agenda/narrative.

Thank you! As abhorrent as ISIL is, they suit the U.S. geopolitical interest in the region. Hence why they haven't been annihilated\n\nDoes anyone remember the report where CIA backed rebels got into a battle with Pentagon backed Kurds? http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-cia-pentagon-isis-20160327-story.html\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I am not advocating for ISIL. The previous administration's stated goal was to topple Assad. It became much more difficult to achieve that goal when the administration failed to garner enough public support for full on military intervention following the lack of action after the "Red Line" was crossed. So, indirect funding of "moderate rebels" was their only course of action.\n\nThe U.S. does this shit all the time, think of the movie Charlie Wilson's War. We funded the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 80's so we could bleed out Russia like they did to us in Vietnam. \n\nHistory repeats itself

When an entity selectively reports the truth to support a narrative/agenda while not reporting other truths then yes I do call it that. I can link you to some other articles that refute the findings of this report, if you'd like.

I am not intending to aggravate you, hopefully you find my responses civil. 
Have you noticed how the last three times we've declared "War" on something other than an actual nation state it has only exacerbated the problem? The War on Terror, The War on Drugs, The War on Poverty....
Agreed. I believe the world is in the middle of a transition right now, which is why things seem so turbulent. The old power structure is in its death throes \n\nI have no idea what will replace it though
The fact that the dollar is the world reserve currency means that there is constant demand for it. I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with your ad hominem

As you look at Polaris (the North Star) you can see the stars revolve around it counterclockwise; at the same time from the same location on the equator you can see Sigma Octanis (the South Star) and the stars revolve around it clockwise.\n\nIf you are so dedicated to find the truth a little trip to the equator will prove it to you.\n\nOr you could pull out a random phone book and find a random person that lives on the equator, give them a call and ask them to look and confirm what I am saying.\n\nSomehow, though, I think you don't want to prove this one way or the other. \n\nIf you do want the truth you will verify what I am saying.

This is where the bullet would exit Kennedy from a shot from the book depository. Their recreation inadvertently proves that the official theory is impossible.

That's just about "2.5 USA units" if you look at a globe of Earth, you will see that the distance between Santiago and Auckland is about 2.5 USA width units.\n\n > Proof <\n\n[Qantas](http://www.farecompare.com/12q/3.47/results.html?siteCode=1&quoteKey=CSCLCAKL201705130000R201705270000P1CTF#results?quoteKey=CSCLCAKL201705130000R201705270000P1CTF)\n\nPlease don't say Qantas is lying. If you go there you are hopeless. Or do some real research and contact someone that has or is going to travel from Santiago to Auckland\n\nIf you are not smart enough to figure out what I just described, then you are surely not smart enough to determine that the Earth is flat.\n\nGotta sleep, later.

Well regarding the first 4 minutes; Polaris is not exactly over the axis of Earth. It will be closest to the axis in 2102, then start moving away from the axis for the next 12,900 then start coming closer. \n\nThuban was the North Star 4,800 years ago at the time of the 'Old Kingdom' in Egypt—a period when most of the pyramids were built. The exact pole has crept from Thuban to its present position near Polaris and now is headed toward gamma Cephei, which will be the North Star in about 2,000 years.\n\nAfter the North Pole in the sky passes gamma Cephei, it will swing on through Cepheus toward Cygnus, the Swan, where the brightest star Deneb will become the Pole Star, although a fairly distant one, 8,000 years from now. By A.D. 17,000, the pole's circular path on the sky will bring it into the northern parts of the constellations Lyra and Hercules. And by A.D. 23,000, Thuban in the constellation Draco, the Dragon, will once again claim the title of North Star.\n\n@1:57 this misinformation spewer says quote:\n\n"heliocentric astronomers cannot adequately explain how Polaris manages to always remain perfectly aligned straight above the north pole."\n\nIf you look at these images you can tell that Polaris is not exactly at the center of the circle that the stars make:\n\nAfter this blatant lie he goes on to spew lie after lie.\n\nhttp://asset.tovima.gr/vimawebstatic//32EA1B97765B9D39FBF035A29C665E46.jpg\n\nhttp://www.pemptousia.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/asteri-Voria_in.jpg\n\nhttp://www.astropix.com/IMAGES/I_ASTROP/TRIPOD/METEORST.JPG\n\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/2781409860_5f8eb402f1.jpg\n\nhttp://universe-beauty.com/albums/userpics/1/10/004_Space_star-trails-03.jpg\n\nhttp://www.photongrabbers.com/galleries/special/20130209_StarTrails/20130209_StarTrails_197min.jpg\n\n@5:00\n\nFrom the equator you can see both the Polaris (the North Star) and Sigma Octanis (the South Star - with binoculars).

The official story says that the plane nose dived from a very high altitude at a zillion miles an hour, that's what caused it to disappear. \n\nHere are the quotes from the people that actually saw flight 93 crash.\n\n\nTim Thornsberg, working in a nearby strip mine: “It came in low over the trees and started wobbling.

Next thing I knew it makes a heck of a sharp, right-hand turn.” It banks to the right and appears to be trying to climb to clear one of the ridges, but it continues to turn to the right and then veers behind a ridge. About a second later it crashes. [ST. PETERSBURG TIMES, 9/12/2001]\n\n\nCharles Sturtz, a half-mile from the crash site: The plane is heading southeast and has its engines running. No smoke can be seen. “It was really roaring, you know. Like it was trying to go someplace, I guess.” [WPXI 11 (PITTSBURGH), 9/13/2001]\n\n\nRob Kimmel, several miles from the crash site: He sees it fly overhead, banking hard to the right. It is 200 feet or less off the ground as it crests a hill to the southeast. “I saw the top of the plane, not the bottom.” [LONGMAN, 2002, PP. 210-211]\n\n\nEric Peterson of Lambertsville: He sees a plane flying overhead unusually low. The plane seemed to be turning end-over-end as it dropped out of sight behind a tree line. [PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE, 9/12/2001]\n\n\nBob Blair of Stoystown: He sees the plane spiraling and flying upside down, not much higher than the treetops, before crashing. [DAILY AMERICAN, 9/12/2001]\n\n\nAn unnamed witness says he hears two loud bangs before watching the plane take a downward turn of nearly 90 degrees. [NEWS CHANNEL 5 (CLEVELAND), 9/11/2001]\n\n\nTerry Butler, a few miles north of Lambertsville: “It dropped out of the clouds.” The plane rose slightly, trying to gain altitude, then “it just went flip to the right and then straight down.” [PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE, 9/12/2001]\n\n\nLee Purbaugh, 300 yards away: “There was an incredibly loud rumbling sound and there it was, right there, right above my head—maybe 50 feet up.… I saw it rock from side to side then, suddenly, it dipped and dived, nose first, with a huge explosion, into the ground. I knew immediately that no one could possibly have survived.” [INDEPENDENT, 8/13/2002]\n\n\nYou decide if it nose dived straight down from a high altitude and buried itself in the ground:

As you go north Sigma Octanis dips below the horizon.\n\nThis is absolute proof that the Earth is a Globe.\n\nLook at this video at :13.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJaOQAGTJo\n\nThat's why the Earth is a globe.\n\n
If the Earth was flat everyone would see the same stars.\n\nIf you go to New Zealand you cannot see the North Star.\n\nThe reason you can't see the North Star is because the world is round.

Yes I am saying that there are two stars, polaris and sigma, and that both are visible (well sigma is dim compared to polaris, but it's position is there.) and that half of the stars are going around one of them and half around the other in the opposite direction?\n\nAll you have to do is go to the equator and see for yourself.
Hey  JoBloggs1,\n\nI'll bite.\n\nIf you can go to New Zealand and take a picture of the North Star, I will convert to a Flat-Earther.

If the Earth was flat, we would all see the same stars.\n\nIf you are in New Zealand you cannot see the North Star.\n\nThe reason you cannot see the North Star is because the Earth is round.\n\nI have never seen a flat Earther explain this.
No, if you warch a ship with strong binoculars you can see them dip beyond the horizon. The only way you will believe this is if you go fo it yourself. Are you near a ocean port?\n\nAnd people have sent up [balloons that show the curvature](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&hl=en&authuser=0&biw=1538&bih=877&site=imghp&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=balloons+that+show+earth+curvature&oq=balloons+that+show+earth+curvature&gs_l=img.3...16020.17396.0.18325.6.6.0.0.0.0.153.757.0j6.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.E-3oQAG9gH4) as well.\n\nHell there are photos that show the Earth as concave.

If the horizon is below the middle of the image it becomes flat and the farther you go it becomes more and more concave. That's what fisheye lenses do. \n\nIf you have a photographer friend that has a fisheye lens you can go prove this for yourself. I'm sure you know someone that has one. If you don't go prove this with a friend you are not seeking the truth.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \nI've seen multiple times from multiple Flat Earthers [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQITXbcz2hg), of the "little piggy" weather balloon. The video and its flat horizon has been upheld as some sort of incontrovertible proof that the Earth is flat. However, what they fail to realize is that by declaring that the image of the horizon in the video is flat they are actually supporting globe Earth theory.\n\nIf you venture three clicks into the "related" videos section, you will find the raw footage of the weather balloon in its entirety. [In this section in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbtXZm_BPe8), the balloon pops and the camera starts falling towards the earth. You'll notice that the horizon distorts [concave up](http://i.imgur.com/rRCGi8q.png) when it is below the centerline of the video, and [concave down](http://i.imgur.com/wRzFWMK.png) when it is above the centerline. This is indicative of the optical distortion of a [fisheye lens](http://www.lenstip.com/upload2/17906_sam8_dys.jpg) .\n\nNow if we go back to the flat earth video you'll notice that the horizon does indeed [appear flat](http://i.imgur.com/VF5fmdf.png), which would have a curvature of zero. However, I'd like to draw attention to the fact that it is below the centerline of the video, meaning that the actual horizon being filmed has a more negative curvature than the image. This means that the actual horizon is concave down, which would be indicative of a globe Earth.\n\nI'm flabbergasted whenever this video is posted, because all anyone has to do is look up the raw footage and verify for themselves. Instead they've taken a random youtuber on blind faith. For shame.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/flatearth/comments/4jod1u/debunking_the_little_piggy_weather_balloon_video/\n\nedit* - www > np\n
No, you are absolutely wrong.\n\nFrom the equator you can see both the Polaris (the North Star) and Sigma Octanis (the South Star). As you look at Polaris (the North Star) you can see the stars revolve around it counterclockwise; at the same time from the same location on the equator you can see Sigma Octanis (the South Star) and the stars revolve around it clockwise.\n\nThis is absolute objective proof that the Earth is a spinning globe.\n\nIf you are so dedicated to find the truth a little trip to the equator will prove it to you.\n\nOr you could pull out a random phone book and find a random person that lives on the equator, give them a call and ask them to look and confirm what I am saying.\n\nSomehow, though, I think you don't want to prove this one way or the other.\n\nIf you do want the truth you will verify what I am saying.

Roger that.
\nDo you agree that if the Earth was flat you would be able to take a picture of the north star from anywhere on Earth?\n\nDo you agree that you can not take a picture of the North Star from New Zealand?\n\nPretty easy questions to answer.
The problem with that is that Kennedy had a gaping cavity on the right rear of his head. A shot from behind would not cause gaping hole in the rear of the head.
Yes, I did look at that video.\n\nNone of it made any sense to me.\n\nThe part where he talks about not being able to see the stars from the different hemispheres was particularly absurd.\n\nThe video image @ 17:14 shows the second person that can't see the same stars underneath the flat Earth. Are you really buying that? Go look at the image. Sheesh!\n\nThe video image @ 17:14 shows the second person that can't see the same stars underneath the flat Earth. Are you really buying that?

Can you put me into contact with one of these flat Earth undersiders? I have a few questions.\n\nIf you correct the image and put the other person on the top of the flat Earth they will see the same stars as everyone else. This is absolutely irrefutable. Just look at the video image you supplied.\n\nJust because someone says all people wouldn't see the same stars doesn't mean it it true. What is true is that if Earth was flat, everyone would see the same stars. This is absolutely true unless you put the person underneath the flat Earth as you deceptive video image shows.\n\nYou are doing harm to planet Earth with your position. Stop it.
Well, I can only wonder if Hillary did win if she would also fall under scrutiny for her own shady dealings with Saudi Arabia and Russia.
I've never heard of "walnut sauce" in my life and I'm a foodie. 
I can tell you what's in his taxes. He's a billionaire and pays practically nothing in taxes.
I like how despite this post solely being about Starbucks and Saudi Arabia, somehow half the posts are about Trump 😂\n\nAnd this is indeed conspiracy because the "leader of the free world" is an ally of this oppressive regime. I would argue even worse than Russia is.
For what it's worth I'm a 31 year old POC female from a diverse city and I definitely don't come from Don's sub 
Exactly how I feel. I don't even know who's idea was to group pro-Trump and pro-pizzagate together!
Sorry, I wouldn't be here if r/politics wasn't compromised since the DNC primaries. 
Watch “Kubrick’s The Shining Analysis - What He Wanted Us to Know - The Fake Moon Landings” on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/76848395?ref=em-share\n\nThis video is good. I think someone shared this somewhere in another post.\n\nThis article is good too: \nhttp://realitysandwich.com/23226/kubrick_apollo/\n\n
I hear you. I guess I was referring to the quality of materials - the steel, the chrome bumper, the cast iron engine. It's physically a solid car (compare any classic car to new ones, it's not just aesthetics).
I only read/watch the msm news to learn what's *not* the truth.
You can't blame the masses for not knowing about pedogate if the media refuses to report on it (or if they do they get silenced like Ben Swann).
Also Brock Turner the asshole Stanford rapist only got 3 months
You should submit this as a standalone post. Sums up everything perfectly. 
Damn. Queen was woke. 
That's what I suspected too. I think we all unanimously agree that the official 9/11 story is a lie. There's literally thousands of threads you can search for. Why bring it up all of a sudden for no reason? It's practically old news (just as the shills keep telling me Hillary lost and is also old news so no reason to discuss anything about her).
If i ever commit half the egregious crimes Hillary has I can only hope to never get prosecuted and let time erase my sins.
What?
And yet she didn't make a single appearance during the biggest women's march in history.
I don't think there should be a statute of limitations on punishing crimes as egregious as this. The Vietnam War happened 40 years ago and I still think the Cambodians and Laotians who were wrongfully bombed should have reparations. Just because Hillary lost doesn't make her crimes disappear. Especially as she has hinted she still wants to be politically active.
Here but taken (lol) cheers
I recently made a post about Hillary Clinton and two different users literally commented the words "Enough Trump spam" 😑
Similarly, if I see a post with 500 comments but only 300 upvotes, I assume that post has been heavily brigaded and downvoted.
There's an episode of It's Always Sunny a couple seasons ago where they hold one of those creepy kiddie beauty pageants and there's a scene where all the kids are eating pizza. I find that episode super creepy now.     
I don't even know why this theory is a thing. Who takes this seriously? Seriously, a basic GIS course should be enough to prove this silly "theory" wrong!
Is that your guys' new talking point?
Call me an idealist but I feel she should be punished. Same with the Bushes, Reagan, Clinton but their legacies are already tainted. I don't want my children 10 or 20 years from now to read in their history books how Hillary was so great and honorable.
I made my own cards and will make dinner. You can celebrate with your significant other without buying into the crap!!
I remember. I only started being more active in this sub after r/politics lost it. I hardly came here before but unfortunately it's the last place to freely discuss politics.
Yep he's getting roasted! I don't use Twitter but it looks like you have to be a real person to make an account (as opposed to reddit where you can buy or create multiple anonymous accounts under a certain organization).
Exactly. I haven't seen this much effort to stifle other theories like 9/11 and the moon landings hoax even though those could be detrimental to tptb. Also, notice how everyone leaves flat-earthers and their "kooky" theory alone? 
Yep. I donated a total of $200. His rallys rivaled Trump's numbers. The line alone here in Oakland, CA to see Bernie was some 15 city blocks.
Strange, can you see my comments?\nYes, it appears people out in the real world are aware. I have many friends and aquaintances, some voted for Hillary, some for Jill (in the bay area so not much Trump support). Nearly everyone I mentioned PG to (face to face or via social media) have not only heard of it but are certain it is real.
Watch the documentary Room 237 (it should be on Netflix or Hulu
I live in Oakland, you should see my Facebook feed. My friends will defend the protesters from yesterday with active threads with dozens of comments. I made a post saying that I have nothing against protests but that I wish they came out 6 months ago when Hillary cheated Bernie from the nomination because we wouldn't even be in this situation right now - barely a peep!
It's funny because I remember when they were pushing the argument "if you're gonna punish Hillary for deleting emails then punish Bush and Colin Powell too!" 
Is this that "fake news" they're warning us about?
Maybe the rats will finally come out of the Capitol building!
The Oakland event last summer when Bernie came to speak was huge. The line to get in was 15 or so city blocks long. All of downtown was closed. I was there when the Occupy protests happened and this was just as big if not bigger.
How many times do I have to say that anti-Hillary is not pro-Trump! I'm a Bernie fan if that means anything.  
This. I wish I had a flair that says "I'm a POC Bernie Supporter who despises Trump" because I can't bring up anything anti-Hillary without being accused.
I don't mind anyone disagreeing with me, but I've been called "fuckface", "dummy" and "Trump supporter " for criticizing Hillary. Can people disagree with facts instead of name-calling? 
I would believe this if he quietly disappeared like O'Malley and even Clinton. The fact that he is just as politically active as ever (and even having a televised debate on mainstream television defending Obamacare) makes me think that is not true. 
I'm almost at the point where I want to put pizzagate on the side and focus on what the DNC actually did - screw up the Democratic primaries and cheat Bernie. I still blame them for bringing us President Trump and I wish justice would be served or else this is just gonna happen again.
A good example is my car. It's an early 1980s benz diesel. I found it for $2500 cash off craigslist. I've had it for 10 years and the only work that needed to be done is regular oil changes and tire replacement. Everything is solidly built and easy to fix, and I've learned from both my mechanic and youtube. Compare to new cars where you can't even replace a light bulb yourself without taking out half the car. Even though I have the money I wouldn't dream of buying a new car that's just going to fall apart in 5 years! 
The author clearly doesn't support Trump and makes a well-reasoned argument. I'm curious how American Bridge will respond. 
Yes. Kubrick is my favorite director and The Shining is my favorite movie. I just recently looked into the moon landings and there are just too many unanswered questions. I have some well written articles and youtube vids bookmarked if you want me to share. Kubrick was an absolute genius and his films are rife with details. 
I'm an artist myself and I love weird, morbid, gory art and I'll be the first to say that Podesta's art collection is beyond the pale in the creepy factor.
I totally remember this. That's why I migrated from politics to this sub and it's happening all over again. I never thought in a conspiracy sub we're not allowed to criticize Hillary.
Well, r/politics was pro-bernie and anti-Hillary during the primaries (at least until CTR began to exist). Now, even on this sub every time I criticize Hillary I get derided. Doesn't make sense to me.
I'm aware who is in power. My point was that a Trump presidency could have been prevented. Also corrupt cheaters should face justice to set an example and hopefully prevent this from happening in the future. I guess that's highly optimistic of me.
For the record, among my fairly large circle of friends I'm aware of maybe a handful of redditors. The general public is woke. Don't let the shills dismay you or stop you from discussing pizzagate. I'll see posts on my Facebook feed of people discussing and agreeing with the reality of pizzagate and the epidemic of child trafficking in general. Keep up the fight for truth!
She was for $12 before she was for $15 and only changed because Sanders made her look bad 
I almost wish she did win so that CTR can get off our backs. Or maybe they would still be here because this is the only sub you can criticize Hillary (or at least used to be). 
Wow, those are 2 minor two word responses! Look at the rest of my post history. I was 100% pro bernie the entire time regardless of where I posted
I'm also suspicious how some memes make it "big" so to speak (where the msm even reports on them), i.e. the "Biden/Obama bromance" ones. How come the memes about Biden being a creepy don't make it on my Facebook feed?
One more thing, I'm from a liberal, diverse city and most of my social circle are Bernie supporters and actively against the Trump administration. 
Zion?
This is what people should be protesting about.
My grandma is a green card holder from the philippines and she got detained there for 2 days about 3 years ago. She is elderly with health problems and she lived and worked here continuously since 1990
Another question to consider: how come Russia never made any manned missions to the moon? Surely they caught up with the technology as they were already ahead of us.?
Some of those Clinton documentaries on YouTube talk about the Mena airport drug drops.
What a waste of water.
This would effectively put all our suspicions to bed.
I got the same except the first search is "George soros is dead". Pretty sure I never googled that particular phrase.
I'm never going to forget how she cheated Bernie and my attention span is larger than 5 minutes. Everyone angry at Trump should be equally angry at Hillary for essentially handing him the election. Cheaters may never win but that doesn't mean they should be off the hook.
Same. I drive a 30 year old diesel Mercedes and I feel this car will never die on me. Plus it looks super classy. I could easily afford a brand new car but I refuse to!
I'm saving this comment. Very well-written.
Well, he has a personal vendetta against pizzagate which is why they also want to quash any mention of Hillary and Podesta.
What does "between 7th and 1600" refer to?
Uber sucked for a lot of reasons before this ban even happened.
I normally don't post a lot but recently I've been posting and commenting more just because I'm so tired of the narrative that is being pushed by certain dubious sources. This is bringing me flashbacks to the DNC primaries and it's an affront to my intelligence. I was more active in r/politics before they ruined it and I couldn't stand if they ruined this sub too!
I don't see how anyone who is pro-democracy can approve of this or let it slide. 
But I don't support Trump at all!
And the carpet bombing of Laos. They were bombed more than Germany and Japan combined! 
Some of the biggest conspiracies, from JFK to 9/11, are political related! What are we supposed to discuss, aliens?
The folks who are trying to discredit OP are only diverging from the subject on hand. 
Really? I never shifted to Clinton. I'm in the East Bay and it was split between Clinton and Stein among the Bernie people I know.
Only to find out about art shows and bands in town
You mean you watch it for the plot ? 
My experience is that real people don't resort to personal attacks (I was called a "dummy" for asking why Hillary wasn't going to be persecuted) and tend to be more neutral or logical, and not so seemingly desperate to disparage others' opinions. It really makes any discussion stifling and this sub wasn't always like this. I almost wish Hillary did win because I can't take 4 more years of a brigaded sub! 
Wow, that's really mean.
Alternatively, just because the msm doesn't report on it doesn't mean it's not happening.
I never posted in Trump's subreddit and don't even support him as a life-long democrat.
People are mad at the electoral college but I'm still mad about the superdelegate system of the DNC!
No, the shills who are mocking pizzagate and claiming we all support Trump are ruining this sub. 
Sorry this is off topic but weed is smoked freely here in the bay area since it's decriminalized. I know the rest of the country is different though. 
I used to come here to refresh myself from the msm lies and find the underlying "truth". Now the well has been tainted and the mental effort to weed out and ignore the shills makes me physically ill sometimes.
I think they didn't expect the DNC leaks and Podesta emails and it threw them off. Winning would put her under even more scrutiny. 
What about Scalia?
Criticizing Hillary is still off limits.
Name one (and don't say Rhianna's instagram)
I giggled
I got exactly the same as you.
What about the fish near Japan?
Ok granted I'm not too familiar with the theory. What is the shape of the earth, flat like a paper? Where are the ends? What about the coriolis effect? Why do GIS and surveying courses teach "grid vs ground" measurements?
Exactly. And if you don't believe, don't insult those who do. I don't believe in flat earth but I don't call those who do "fuckface" (an actual word someone said to me in another thread for criticizing Hillary)
The restaurant is in the Potrero Hill neighborhood in San Francisco which used to be open grassland/pastures with goats and other grazing animals. But I agree with everything else you said.
Wow...wtf? 
If Gaddafi was so evil why did Beyonce perform for him for $1 million? Lol
An Alan Watts-like response. Very well said!
Imagine, for a second, that these scientists are lying in order to play out an agenda. Also imagine that Trump was played by media to look more brutal and moronic than he is -- he's still certainly a silly man with an ego -- and that he is aware that we've all been lied to for ages by scientists/NASA. Imagine that. Imagine that conscious civilizations have been around significantly longer than we've been told. Imagine that the earth is a vibration pattern, just like humans are and everything fathomable is, and that every X number of years, its poles shift, causing massive weather changes. Imagine that and then question scientists' words and actions. Imagine you've been lied to and play detective for a bit. Turn off mainstream media and do some online research. Follow your heart. Soon, you might realize that the world is the exact opposite of what you'd originally thought. 
I keep hearing that TPTB have been recycling human flesh into our cheap meat supply (fast food) for a frighteningly long time now, as a form of mockery.
Prayed for you bruh
God + o = good /\nDevil = D'evil = of the evil\n\nHa. Cool beans. Hadn't even noticed that.
Yes! My intuition suggests that we will catch up soon enough. Always a pleasure, Sovereign :)
beautiful.
TPTB have been aware of this kind of shit for ages, obviously. They've mocked us, as we'll see with more scientific breakthroughs, with symbols and icons for corporations/religions. The more universal secrets we discover, the more we'll realize we exist in a world run by cruel, sadistic psychopaths who want us to suffer. But justice is on the horizon. They've had their time at the top, and now it is time for Love to reign. 
That was incredibly well written. I enjoyed and related to that response a lot. Particularly loved that last paragraph. I am going to keep replies going on this thread regarding my progress. Might help someone else.
I have them all :D I can start at level 1 with ya if you want. Whatever I play, it'll be a tank so that we can fly through dungeons\n\n
I just finished a book that suggests our entire history of existence is flawed. We've been lied to about how long humans have been around, and we've been lied to about the people in charge of our society. We've been lied to about our climate and haven't been told things like: everything is a vibration, including the Earth, and every 13,000-some-odd years, the Earth's poles shift. Thus, what was once frozen becomes revealed, and what was once revealed becomes frozen. Everything in existence is a vibration, a back and forth motion, so, to me, this makes sense. \n\nI think Trump has been informed about the cruel lack of truth that has existed for decades, maybe generations, on our planet. We've created illusions that are almost impossible to abolish and see through. People are so caught up in their jobs, their problems, their worries, that they have forgotten that each one of us is Life, itself. A blade of grass is life. A cloud is life. You are life. You are not your name or your baggage...all of that is simply a thought. What you are is the whole thing. We are all the universe.\n\nI think there's more to life than we know. And some of this stuff, I intuitively feel, will eventually be brought to light. I also expect intense down-voting because, for some reason, when you bring this stuff up, people and their egos tend to get incredibly scared and judgmental. Oh well. Love you all!
I've learned that, a lot of times, spiritual awakening happens as a consequence of deep depression because, at some point, the real you just can't take the nonsense anymore. It just can't take being so sad, so confused, so lost in a world that is literally the essence of what each of us is. To feel lost in this world is insanity -- because the fabric of being is the same fabric that is the world -- but we've been raised without the knowledge of the truth of our existence. We fear death because we've been trained to, we perpetually fear being homeless or not having money because we've been trained to, even the entire economic system was set up to keep us from ever finding peace. Because if we're perpetually worried about our jobs, our kids, our safety, our longevity, our world, etc., then we'll never have the time to sit there and contemplate what the hell we actually are and what the hell we're actually doing/where we're going in life.\n\nAnd with all that thinking and worrying, we become addicted to our thoughts. And, by becoming addicted to thought, we buy into the idea of actually being the 'little me' that manifests after years of believing we are this mental image, which tends to have a name given to us by parents. \n\nTook me 26 years to realize I wasn't my name and all the ideological baggage I carried with the idea of myself. Took me 26 years to realize that pride is an illusion and is created to keep humans from ever realizing their true potential, because pride is an illusory cognitive jail cell in which no one can ever find freedom.\n\nAll of this stuff sort of just hit me one day when I was smoking some ganja and contemplating suicide. That same day, I came across an Alan Watts YouTube video discussing how humanity currently lives in a collective state of mass insanity because we believe we are our egos. That changed my life.\n\nI'm with you brother. Glad to hear you're on the upside, too. In honesty, I still struggle here and there. I'm a very sensitive dude, fortunately and unfortunately, and I feel that I can sense the collective suffering of the world day in and day out. I also have trouble going back out into the world knowing what I do now because it pains me to see sadness and it pains me to partake in a master-slave reality. \n\nBut I am learning to let go of my personal beliefs so that I can venture back out into existence with a clean slate of being, where I judge literally nothing. I want to, from here on, live a completely judge-free existence. The paradigm through which I perceive all there is, I pray, will soon be that of pure love.\n\nIf you ever want someone to talk to, feel free to shoot me a message. Quite literally, I am you, so we might as well help each other because we'll be helping ourselves, no matter how you look at it! Cheers <3
Unless people have been conditioned to fear a certain animal, thus sort of subconsciously conditioning them to not be drawn towards animals in general. People make stupid, impulsive comments regularly that don't define who they are at all. I have to disagree with your comment fundamentally but can see how, more times than not, people who openly dislike animals are less sensitive people. 
okay, a good idea to be aware of. i appreciate that. 
Short answer? Yes. ;)
My man. Love those vibes. Will add ya
Yep. added you !
No shit.
Are people aware of how evil Hillary Clinton is? Are awake people aware of her intentions and the horrors that would've ensued had she won? I feel like no one actually reads the emails that were exposed. Trump has an ego but I firmly believe his ego will lead him to expose some very awful truths going on behind the scenes, because the powers that be did everything they could to eliminate him from the race (causing his ego disgust in the process), which will open the nations eyes once we start seeing things that have been veiled for decades. And when you start realizing everything outside yourself isn't what you thought it was (many leaders we have loved in past are actually cruel/psychopathic), it leads you to question what you really are. \n\nAt the end of the day, our world is run by giant children who believe in the 'little me'. Imagine the day the world is lead by an awake human. I enjoy imagining that.
I listen to a guy who was MK Ultra'd and, several years after childhood, went on a quest to figure out wtf had happened to him. That led him to start meditating, etc. Eventually, his mind awakened and he remembered everything. He goes on to talk in great detail about everything that is really happening behind the scenes in the world -- i'll be honest, it gets a bit strange, he goes on and on about ETs controlling the paradigm and stuff but remains completely convincing and he was also recently and randomly assassinated -- and he admits that every major sports program we watch on TV is undoubtedly rigged by TPTB. \n\nShoot, who knows. They have the tech to create the internet and text messages. Doesn't blow my mind that they might have tech in space with the ability to mess with players' physical functions at certain times. They might also cut players' deals off the field and what not. Idk. I played college football and that game last night made me think Max Spiers, and you, are completely right. It just makes no sense.\n\nIt's a great way to keep us distracted from pursuing truth and content in putting all of our time and energy into consuming sports/buying tickets/listening to sports radio, etc.
blatant triangular illuminati pryamid symbolism imo. Zelda prob = Zion or some shiz lol idk
Ah, convenience! Thanks so much 
My friend. I think you've allowed your emotions to get in the way of your logic/understanding of what I'm getting at.\n\n'Thinking psychologically': that is a huge part of my post. What I am speaking about is the mind's mechanism/how it works. Where I'm from, racism does not exist. It's a lovely town with what must be a more collectively aware bunch than most other areas, I assume. Thus, it has always confused me that we continue throwing political correctedness in the faces of the public via mainstream. I GET that african americans were treated disgustingly and that they might maintain a sense of precaution when dealing with people with white skin. But I do not feel I need to be endlessly reminded about how poorly they were treated. What does that do to the collective psyche? If anything, it makes one rebel against MSM because one feels so far superior to these issues that they consider mainstream. Or, on the other hand, it makes one feel guilty and lesser than one might otherwise feel. It creates separation. It makes me think that I am other than you. That can't be argued. I'm not even sure what that whole rant you went on was about. But, good lord, the defensiveness on your behalf was screaming at me! Cheers.
I know global warming is real. That's blatant. But I also think there is something more natural going on within and of the planet itself, an evolution or rise in frequency which also effects the weather patterns, and TPTB are keeping that crucial information from us. \n\nThere's no vibrations? What? There Earth isn't vibrating? Everything that has ever existed...ever...isn't a vibration? Everything isn't perpetually moving and changing? Things aren't going back and forth at rapid speeds in order to be able to be manifest as matter? Everything, including the planet, isn't energy/perpetually changing infinity?\n\nI know plenty. I'm theorizing. I have an open mind and I also think I'm right! :)\n\nIt's global warming...and something else. And I think it ties in to the Schumann frequency report. Things are changing, as is the Earth and it's environment. It's an amazing time to be alive
Resisting that which will not change. Perpetuating separation. Exaggerating conflict. Treating a head ache with a punch to the forehead. \n\nThis 'resistance' movement is insane. Literally, those who participate are not in sane states of mind. They are brainwashed and believe everything they hear that stems from a negative paradigm. It's as if this generation of people has been groomed to exist off of cognitive conflict. It's as if people are hungry for rebellion, and it's a hunger that cannot be satisfied. It is an illogical, rash hunger.\n\nIt's time to ask the question: what am I? What is this 'I'? If I am alive, then I am life itself. If I am life itself, and the universe and all living things are life itself, then what am I? Am I everything? I am not my name or my memories, clearly. So, is my entire understanding of what I am a complete illusion? \n\nWake up, wake up, everybody, everywhere! <3
Outrageous, invalid comment <3
It's all a lie. It's honestly to keep you all in fear. Worry about this! Worry about that! This man is awful! Fear him! We're doomed! NASA is owned by the elite. It's theorized that they've kept some overwhelming information from the public -- information that would change the way we understand the world and the universe. How is that so insane? You were born and believed everything someone else has told you, forever. Imagine those things were lies in order to play out an agenda and keep you blind. I was once anti-conspiracy. Then I really woke up. I will not follow this twitter account because I am awake
Anyone else ask "What am I?" and pursue the ego battle at a young age? 
Went down that rabbit hole. Somehow survived. Take the synchronicity, observe it, contemplate it briefly, appreciate its message and efforts to direct you towards positivity, and move on/be present. No need to spent a lifetime chasing hints, or the message disappears from the equation!
Certainly! I like to think psychologically...\n\nPrior to waking up to actual reality, I was a heavy social media user (I'm in my late 20s). Also, I was a competitive body builder. As you can imagine, working in an industry where one thrives on others' superficial tastes, instagram became a great outlet for my work. \n\nOne day, scrolling through instagram photos, I recognized how depressed I'd become and had no idea why. I had attained the life I wanted all along, but something was lacking.\n\nI realized that I was depressed because my mind was screwed up. I'd spent so much time on instagram, snapchat, etc. -- which are social media platforms where people compete, subconsciously, to show others that they are living the best lives -- that my mind had developed an understanding of reality as being something where you NEED THINGS to be happy. \n\nUsing instagram and seeing, endlessly, photos of beautiful people on beautiful vacations with tons of money and apparent happiness, we internet-users subconsciously assume that's what we want too. But it shouldn't be that way because, in many peoples' lives, that stuff isn't attainable. Beyond that, none of that stuff brings actual happiness.\n\nWe've been conditioned to need / conditioned to feel lack. And so much of that comes from social media, which is the internet. People endlessly competing to be the best and to be right. \n\nIt's taken us away from the fact that we are all the same, one thing.\n\nEdit: i believe it was the powers-that-be's intent for this to happen to our minds. i think it would've happened regardless of the internet, but the internet was put in place to accelerate and deepen our internal conflict. Our reality seems to have been designed to keep us from being able to easily and perpetually exist in a peaceful state of being. \n\nConflict = suffering = separation = negative energy = confusion = anger = irrational behavior = looking for scapegoats
Thank you. Much appreciated. This is the one road block I'm focusing on getting past right now :)
I think people also refer to 'awakening' with different meanings. As the Earth's frequency rises, people are beginning to question what 'they' are; not so much what is going on externally in the world. \n\nThe horrors that are making themselves known through the careless mistakes of TPTB -- or rather through the degree of negative energy created by the actions of TPTB that have grown so strong that they are no longer able to be veiled from our eyes -- are also resulting in plenty of people posing questions as such, "Well, if everything I've ever thought to be true in the world was, for the most part, untrue, then is what I've thought I was all along not true too? Is this 'I' feeling really 'me'? What is 'me'?" And that question, inevitably, leads to a spiritual awakening in which you realize that mankind is currently living in a state of insanity in which our true consciousness is veiled by ego, and ego is a false mental construction manifested by one's devout belief in one's thoughts. In other words, humanity spends so much time thinking nowadays that we've literally grown to believe we are our thoughts and have become attached to illusions.\n\nBut, we're stepping out of that dense, simple way of perceiving reality and are stepping into an illusionless world, where only truth reigns. No longer will the world be run by negativity and the selfish belief in a 'little me'. Rather, the world will be run by a more open-minded, united mass of people who understand, factually, that all of us come from the same One thing. We are all one, despite how corny or abstract that sounds.\n\nSo, I'm not sure I can agree with you. I don't consider an awakening to be something related purely to politics. You can be living in the jungle with no idea about what's going on in "the real world" and you can still be experiencing an awakening as your consciousness is literally entering a new dimension.\n\nYou've been awake for 20 years, meaning you've been more aware of the truth behind political/worldly issues for a longer period of time than others. But have you taken the time to contemplate what you actually are? Do you understand factually that you are everything you have ever experienced? Do you see clearly that all you have ever been is right here and right now? Do you see clearly that time is an illusion, that space is an illusion? These are the things to be asking right now, in my opinion. But kudos to you for being politically awake for so long; there are certainly plenty of people who need guidance from people like yourself at this point in time. Cheers, man.
Lmao. INFINITE LOVE AND MULTIPLE EPICS TO YOU MY FRIEND!!! :)
I don't believe anything that isn't true. Our understanding of reality is not true. I've discovered that, after escaping the standard American lifestyle and taking time to contemplate/learn. \n\nIn the same way that 99.999% of our species believes it is its thoughts, a significant portion of the population also believes that our strange climate oscillations are simply a manifestation of human-doing. \n\nObviously, spraying chemicals into the air can hurt the atmosphere. That, to me, seems intuitively obvious. And that'd be a wonderful narrative to use to convince the mass public that it's all OUR fault and we need to be ANGRY at those who disagree. Perpetuate separation between us -- more negative energy, as always seen on the news -- which has always been intentional by the powers that be. Blows my mind that, collectively, people aren't aware of this yet.\n\nBut I think it goes deeper than that. The Earth, itself, is going through its own emotional changes right now, and we are going to see wild weather patterns regardless of what humans do to prevent it. But, the powers that be will keep that information from us because they don't want us to understand that we've been lied to about our planet, our science, our existence, our reality all along. \n\nI mean, people really think humans are born, work, have some memories, die, then go to some heaven. People are so busy in this master-slave reality where we endlessly pay bills, worry about safety, etc. that we haven't had time to contemplate reality or who/what we are. No one questions what the hell is really going on here, for the most part. No one realizes that this existence, this moment right now, is the heaven, but that people are in control of our existence the second we are born into this Earth. These same people tell you that Trump is insane and that he is trying to destroy our planet.\n\nNo. The planet is going through puberty, in a way. It's going to get worse before it gets better. But if we knew that, we'd be at peace with it. And if we were at peace with it, the world would be a more peaceful place. And if the world were a more peaceful place, those that thrive off our negativity/consumerism/separation would lose their power. \n\nSorry if I ranted. My beliefs, clearly, astray from the norm. I try to be as clear as I can. I can't say I have evidence because even our understanding of history is false. But I guess the best I can do is point you to question certain things that'll make you, potentially, begin to question reality. \n\nWhat is this 'I' ? The 'I' feeling, the 'me' feeling. What is that? Using thought, can I find it? Can I find 'I' ? Can thought find itself, its origin? No. That's because thought is an illusion that prevents humanity from seeing that what we are is, in fact, life itself. Life is the universe. Thus, we are all God. To me, that is blatant. But to the masses, that is insanity. We've been brainwashed and we're fighting a fight, such as the climate change fight, that's essentially futile. Yes, we add to the destruction of our environment and we should stop doing the obvious harmful things. But there's more to it than we think...I think. \n\n;)
We aren't any 'thing'. We are, rather, no thing. Our paradigm is infinite space, nothingness, no words can describe that truth. Only silence. But we play the game that we are this important, needy, little 'me'. 
None of us exist.
No. I have plenty of clues. Open your mind.
right on. I'm 26. Have two horde DPS 110s. They aren't crazily geared but they're decent. I'd be down to run whenever. I'll add ya ;)
At least someone agrees! Lol. I'm with ya, friend
Any reading material on this stuff to suggest, mate? Cheers
Last spring. I sat outside for probably 12 hours, staring at flowers. I hadn't had a spiritual/religious bone in my body. As a matter of fact, I'm a professional bodybuilder who played college football and had aspirations of going to wall street. Well, all that ended. That day, I just sat there, staring at the flowers, smiling...because, for the first time, the mechanism that used to tell me, "Go do something..." or "You need to attain something to be where you need to be" finally shut the hell up. I was present for the first time in my life. I was without thought/ego.
You'd be the world's worst therapist/best friend.
Good to know. Thanks!
> So, what has happened is that you've heard the right-wing trolls saying that SJWs want to enforce diversity and make minorities have more rights than you\n\nNothing I said had anything to do with MY rights. Nothing was personal. It was all psychologically based. That one point, alone, represents how invalid your logic is. I can't tell if you're trolling me, honestly.\n\nRegardless, I'll try to get my post across one more time. Let's say we were discussing transsexuals, explicitly. Let's say I couldn't understand why MSM would spend weeks running shows on why we need to be more accepting of TS. To me, accepting people of other sexuality seems obvious. But, that's just me.\n\nNow, by running these shows all day, every day, on why we need to accept TS and the horrors that ensue for those people when we don't, might it be fair to argue that being endlessly brainwashed with moral-based TV programs on what we should and should not do as a people to a minority has some negative effect on the human psyche? Children watching those programs subconsciously assume that there are massive issues with how we perceive sexuality. That might affect the way they perceive all of being, in that it's more separate than they naturally assumed. \n\nIt has the same effect on adults. To see the same message about avoiding racism over and over creates in our minds the sense that racism hasn't had any break throughs over time -- that we haven't 'grown up' a bit over the decades. Rather, it seems to me that, based on what pops up on MSM re. racism, it's getting much worse. But I really don't think it is. \n\nIf, at the end of the day, the goal is equality for everyone, but deeply ingrained in our minds is the sense that equality is so far from being here and now, then we maintain this mental pursuit towards massive global change when it doesn't have to be massive at all. It could change over night if everyone just recognized that we're all the same thing. Why would you hurt another human if you actually KNEW -- not just intellectually, but actually felt it as fact -- that each human was the same thing as you. Not like...oh, I'm wearing Nikes and you are wearing Nikes so we should get along. Instead, it's like...oh, I'm alive. Thus, I'm life itself. And you are too. The essence of what we are is identical. Why would I hurt me? \n\nBut rather than bringing us together with their message, MSM separates us and feeds us narratives of why one group was wrong and another group needs to change. It perpetuates the lack of love between the parties included. It is, in my mind, a fundamental error in approaching how to deal with the issue at hand. \n\nIf you aren't aware of racism being a bad thing, then you are oblivious. If you are aware, then you're sick of being told about it because you, yourself, have already changed. Or you never had to change at all. \n\nLastly, I never blamed anyone but MSM, the propagandizers. But you seem to think I put blame on victims of their work? I do think you're trolling me, so I'll let this die. Well done.\n
Those three characters, if you don't know already, are theorized to be incredibly evil behind the scenes of government and two of them are, I've heard, thought to be of another species. Reptilian. To be witnessing them in dreams might be signs that your consciousness is trying to wake you up to something. Maybe to remember something. Just my opinion!
The Pope judges? He is supposed to represent the acceptance of all, regardless of sin. 
Hey, thanks. I was completely unaware that that is a generally understood notion, particularly on this site! 
Haha appreciate the concern. I know I sound crazy. I love this stuff though. I've accumulated my perspective through Max Spiers YouTube videos, an understanding of MK ultra, having an open mind, a sudden spiritual awakening, listening to everyone without bias, listening to Alex jones vs Joe rogan podcast, being depressed and contemplating reality, following the leaking news and reading leaked emails, understanding I do not exist as I 'thought' I did, discovering that almost all of humanity is living in a false reality and experienced being through an illusory ego/mental fabrication known as 'me'. Plenty of other things have led me to question things differently than others. I have no problem being told I sound outrageous because I am! 
I believe almost everything this man says. I have nothing to prove that it's true but that his words ring true to my heart. I've watched almost every interview on Youtube re. Max Spiers and I genuinely believe he is warning us of what is to come. His ultimate message? Have no fear.
I'm someone who went deep into the rabbit hole. And I think NASA, being owned by the global elite, has kept some deep information from us. I even think a lot we know about the universe/solar system isn't so much what we think it is. I think tptb are trying to keep us as unaware as possible of the naturally happening cosmic events occurring right now. Who knows, maybe I'm wrong. But the schumann resonance adds to my confidence in thinking that there is a global awakening among humans and the Earth, resulting in some wild physical and interior changes. Changes in what we consider as weather, changes within peoples' consciousness, etc. But...I'm a crazy hippy. So who knows.
You were definitely one of the geared toons in vanilla that I revered as a kid. Lol. So cool of you! Adding ya now :D\n\n
This is weird, but I was going to respond to your reply without having finished reading your whole response. Why? Because, after reading that your headache ended and you felt energy through your forehead, it aligned perfectly with my thoughts on my experiences feeling these frequencies within my head lately. Never was I a spiritual person prior to these past 10 months, but something has happened where I've been drawn to it. I've been drawn to the idea of the third eye and have even begun having strange, intuitive realizations. Like, for example, one day I was walking to work and it dawned on my that an atom, which makes up human form and is a center/nucleus with crazy fast electrons flying around it to make a sort of ring around the nucleus, I noticed how the atom looks incredibly similar to Saturn. What does that imply? That the make up of our being is similar in form to that of planets? Does that imply that I might be something grander than I've been led to believe in this life time? Am I, in fact, the universe? Is the essence of consciousness the universe using me as a tool to see and, eventually, become aware of itself? What am I? What is it that is hearing these frequencies? It's the most beautiful and exciting thing to ponder! I'm a pianist. Nice to hear from a fellow musician who shares interest in the supernatural :)
Check out the 100th monkey effect. The more consciousnesses that are aware of truth, the more consciousnesses will eventually become aware of truth. How? What we are, fundamentally, is energy. That which can neither be created nor destroyed. The world is more magical, more spiritual, than our generation has been groomed to know. We can pass information along through the energetic frequencies our consciousness manifests. So, by being a truth seeker and going down the rabbit hole with a strong heart and resilient mind, we are doing our part in waking up the world. Once the entire world is aware of the truth, we'll kick the doors down of the elite cabal and make this world beautiful again. That's my reasoning. Cheers, brother
Watch more of his videos. It'll blow your mind how conscious he is. Towards the end of his life, and I know this sounds abstract, but it's almost like he knew the truth to such an amazing degree that the universe was slowly easing him into his inevitable death. He was drugged by someone who didn't want him to keep speaking. 
Haha I've certainly experienced glimpses of madness throughout my journey.\n\nThe truth is that the thing in you trying to figure all this out -- the thing seeking -- is the same mechanism preventing you from seeing the truth. The hardest part is letting go of our major cognitive structures that aren't beneficial nor are they real.
Labeling is judging is separation. They are all one in the same. Labeling is the mind providing a description for whatever form/concept it is perceiving.\n\nFor labeling, or judging, to take place, there must obviously be one who does the judging. So, for man to partake in judging, he enters into a realm of good and bad. To exist in a world of good and bad is to exist in a world of judging. To step out of that world is to awaken. There is no judger, for if there ever were, real peace would be forever unknown. \n\nFortunately, through confusion, suffering, and thus, awakening, judgments/thoughts/conditionings are no longer controlling our conscious state of being. When we now partake in discussion, we're losing the 'little me' who has to be right and has to be the winner of the debate.\n\nRather, we're awakening to and caring for the truth. \n\n
My man -- I am having trouble engaging in a debate with you. It's absolutely fair to bring up your emotions in a debate because -- as they're clearly there in your case -- emotional debates are clear signs that you're attached to your beliefs. You are undoubtedly unwilling to genuinely listen to both sides of the argument. Additionally, I just went through your post history because I couldn't believe the extent of your rant and recognized that you're approaching each debate the same way. \n\nRacism is thrown in our faces. Turn on the TV. Are you serious? \n\n'lol kk whatever'? That made me cringe.\n\nI'm fighting against equal rights with my post? That's what you insinuated. And that's disgusting. How dare you. Your tactics are ridiculous and I see what you're doing. Equal rights, to any good person, are something that should exist at all times, everywhere. My thread has nothing to do with equal rights. It has to do with what endless advertising can do to the way we perceive issues. \n\nIn all honesty, I love you. But I think it's time to take a deep breath -- DEEP -- and think fairly, logically.\n\nI hold NO beliefs and NO values because if I were to hold them, I would not fairly or logically see the argument posed. I just cannot get into a debate with someone as heated as you, particularly when you refuse to actually listen to what I'm trying to say. You are a chicken with your head cut off, screaming at those who oppose you. It's blatant in your post history. I've never experienced this degree of ignorance, in all honesty. \n\nBut I do appreciate your responses. They've woken me up to how deep the mind control goes. Your ego is outrageous. I often think we've been groomed by TPTB to essentially crave rage and suffering because it makes the 'little me' feel dominant. I AM RIGHT, it will say. And when it's right, it feels great. But that 'little me' isn't even real. It's a belief. Wake up. Either way, I love ya. And one day, we will both die. So don't take this stuff too seriously. It's all a game.\n\nOh, and purple monkey dishwasher. You make no sense.
Thanks. Guess I could've used google, but enjoy interacting with players... :) Cheers
I went through a sudden spiritual awakening while being very depressed about a year ago. Knowing 'I' didn't exist as the thought of me that I'd become to attached to was an overwhelming realization. Something led me to research aliens after that and I've become mystified by the idea of contact. It's so interesting. Thank you 
Sent you invite :)
You're the man. Thank you. To UC!
Listen to Max Spiers' talks on YouTube. He is an awakened man and exposes what he knows for we people to make our own conclusions
I'm not disagreeing with you. I think the technology has been there longer than we can fathom. But from what I understand, the powers that be do not want that to happen. It strips them of the power they've grown to known and desire so deeply. But I think these 'powers that be' will be exposed soon. That's what I'm saying. My dream, of course, is that our world is run by we the people!
I'd suggest forgetting everything you've ever known before reading his response. I say that to suggest eliminating all bias and using your heart as the paradigm through which you find Truth; not by using your mind.
In a way, yes. But to reiterate, I'm speaking on behalf of no duality. There's a more conscious state that we're all available to reach that's aware that all is one. it becomes conscious of the concept, and thus consciousness becomes conscious of itself. Consciousness becomes itself, which is what we're after through the seemingly beneficial lessons we learn throughout lifetimes. \n\nSo, to say the universe uses us is to imply that there are two things seen through separate lenses. The truth is that there, either positive or negative, is only one energy. Just as man is man and woman is woman but, in essence, man is woman. Because all is life itself. Sorry for abstractness. It's hard to avoid re. this material...
Thanks so much for all that. Know any interesting books worth reading on this topic? These subjects have taken over my mind recently, seemingly without my choosing! It's all fascinating. 
I credit Alan watts with saving my life. I'd become deeply depressed in college and his brilliant lectures changed the way I see the world. \n\nThe Joker, one of his longer lectures, is brilliant. I also love "the eye for which there is no I". Both of those titles can be typed into YouTube to find the link. I'd do it for you but am at a red light :)\n\nCheers, friend. If you want more, PM me
Can't make that synchronicity up. I just taught philosophy on RWE for a semester at my alma matter college. I believe philosophy opened my mind to the point of peering beyond the 'me'. \n\nThank you for the guides. Will check them both out. 
belieee dat.
I'm a little confused by your question. If science is wrong, which I believe it is, and we create a better world for nothing, then we have created a better world for nothing. \n\nHowever, I'm not someone who believes the world can change only if a few people with a materialistic object (money) decide so. Rather, I believe that, because we are all 100% energy, if our frequencies, or understandings of what's really happening in reality, understand the truth, the universe will respond with profound change. In other words, the secret lies in waking up those who have no understanding of the truth behind reality. They are unaware of the veil that has existed before our eyes all along, preventing us from understanding what goes on outside us, but even more importantly, preventing us from knowing who we really are.\n\nLong story short: IMO, it doesn't matter if you have billions of dollars or no money at all. If you know the truth and live it, you are playing an enormous role in assisting mankind to wake up to reality/love/light. When more light shines through us, the world will clean itself.
Idk though. The collective human frequency is rising (schumann). Open-mindedness is contagious because when one recognizes one isn't open-minded, and witnesses true open-mindedness in a companion, that closed-minded person is personally introduced to an enormous flaw in character. And I see this happening regularly now. People are changing and so is the Earth's/our environment's frequency. It's all connected. Just maybe not to the degree OP fathoms.
I once read that the global agenda is to have the human-worker-species slowly become a one-gender species (both male and female in one body) because having two genders is more expensive and complicated to maintain. Additionally, by getting rid of the male, they get rid of the powerful, outward energy we men carry which would be the kind of energy most likely to fight back/defend. I have no trouble seeing how, if I were psychotic, I would prefer the slaves I control to be pumped with sexual and feminine ideologies so as to weaken them while also getting what I (the perverted cabal) want.
The crooked elite own NASA. Question everything and wake up.
A theory in the comments of reddit by someone spiritual who loves drugs and the universe. 
Of course you can! We can party up from different servers and level together. that would be awesome! add my battle tag listed above and PM me whenever :)
I can only speak subjectively. I live a lifestyle where I have plenty of free time, despite being in my 20s, so I was able to start meditating all day, on my own, and genuinely. Introspection. Reading books on spirituality (I suggest books by Alan watts and adyashanti), podcasts also by those two men (which you can always find free on YouTube), finding peace of mind, smoking marijuana, trying LSD (not my suggestion, just what subjectively aided me in questioning consciousness), exercise, sleep, and realizing that the entire point of every living being's experience is to, eventually, find this truth and let their ego go. It's the way to finally peer beyond the veil of illusion and see the truth; that this experience here and now is heaven as is.\n\nQuite literally, stop thinking. That's how you let go. For me, depression made it easier. I hated my life and thus embraced change/truth. \n\nIf you want more details, follow my post history and take a read. The easiest way to truly let go is to realize this isn't a joke, your 'seeking' is preventing you from seeing. Stop looking, just for a moment. Even if it's just for a damn second. And what are you left with? Stop judging because judging is seeking. Stop it all. Just be. For a moment. And where do you go? Ask questions like that and be more fucking honest and serious with yourself than you've ever been. Find that wisdom and you'll see the truth. And once you see it, you'll begin the quest to become it.
I will practice all of that today. Thank you for your thoughtful words and please keep informing the public. Much love
I must also ask: how did you stumble upon this old post? Cheers, friend <3
Yeah. So much of what I do is a conditioning stemming from shame/guilt of feeling lazy. Letting go of that shame is so liberating. 
For a clear we picture there were only 17 Falcons plays run that half. 
Not really. But productive is a relative term. We all have different conditionings to perceive 'productive' differently. My idea of productive has evolved from thinking I need to look the fittest/make the most money to, instead, learning to love every living thing wholly and enjoying that which I already have. \n\nI'm lazy right now in life. Maybe that'll change down the road. But I have no motivation for anything to be other than it is at this moment.
PSYCHOLOGICALLY SPEAKING: by being force fed, endlessly, topics of political incorrectness and how things MUST change, the mind of those watching who are not part of the discriminated group tends to feel 'deeply other than' the group that was discriminated, and vice versa.\n\nAny sane human knows not to treat his brother unlike himself. Why? It's encoded in our DNA. We are all life itself. \n\nThe tactic seems to be point and blame, scold and shame, and tell one side of the issue to be aware of what it has done in the past and what it continues to do now. That tactic perpetuates separation. Rather, why wouldn't MSM say something along the lines of: listen, we were dumber decades ago and were less aware. There was no spirit or understanding that each one of us is One. We are all human; forget skin color. Instead, we hear...black people, do this. White people, do this. Never is there a bringing together of people. Never. Only a separation through very clever tactics. SO clever, in fact, that people are getting personal with me on this thread immediately.
I see a DNA strand.
I spiraled into depression after graduating from an ivy league school and have dedicated myself to bringing love to the world. Not employed. But I keep getting hit with random panic attacks. I'm also deeply drawn to the stories of Max spiers, if you know him. When i meditate i can sometimes feel overwhelmed with a powerful, loving energy that I can literally feel is oozing out, very strongly, into the world. But other days, I wake up in a cloud and have no idea what I'm doing and completely forget why it's so important to me that I channel this love to the world. I've always assumed I was one of these people being watched and attacked. Also, recently, I wanted to grab a coffee and typed into my phones internet: Coffee Near Me. What popped up was coffee shops in Washington, DC, and google maps showed that I was located in the capital building. I live in PA. Also, that same morning, a tinted car followed me, with two cameras on front of the windshield, as the driver also took photos of the back of my car with an iPad. Blatantly holding it up towards my license plate. Once he got the photos in traffic, he took the next exit. It was bizarre and terrifying until I learned to let go of all the fear. Hopefully I'm not just in my head.....
Pretty sure I noticed the symbol on the shoulders of the robotic-like-avatars in the latest Call of Duty. It was lightning-colored-baby-blue. 
Video perpetuates one's words, dead or alive. If you watch a video of a presently dead person speaking from years ago, they aren't with us in form but their words are still presently being said here and now. So, my way of speaking technically fits ;)
Certainly fun to imagine :)

Brilliant advice! Will add now! And cheers, friend. It feels good to be back in the world!
So glad I randomly dropped acid and came across Alan Watts before reading a physicist confirm these findings. Not sure my ego could've handled it. What a time to be alive. \n\nEverything you've ever seen, ever known, is literally 1 single entity. And that entity is you. That me feeling is the universe -- the divine -- experiencing itself.
Wow. Sent you a personal message. Very interested in picking your brain. 
I'm with you. I think GW is a scam to induce fear. \n\nIf the Earth, just like all things, is a vibration, it makes sense to me that the Earth might be going through some sort of evolutionary phase where weather patterns oscillate more and more frequently and to more and more of a powerful degree. \n\nIn the same way that humans get hot flashes and cold flashes -- more and more often and more and more powerfully as a fever/sickness reaches its boiling point before it dies and good health/better immunity comes into play -- I feel that the Earth is going through a similar cycle right now. The weather gets worse, and does so more and more often, until it gets significantly better. So, I think this crazy weather is inevitable -- unless TPTB are actually using tech to tamper with weather patterns, as Alex Jones suggested in his podcast with Joe Rogan -- and that TPTB are able to use it as an incredibly potent fear mechanism. \n\nEdit: I believe global warming is real, but I also believe there are other more natural factors that are causing the extremities. 
Hang around for a bit longer. You'll see it. I'm very spiritual and have read that plenty of souls have come to Earth from elsewhere just to witness this monumental time in our planet's history.

To kill them would be to participate in the same energy-frequency that they love. Any sign of negative emotion is what they feed off of. So, execution would, somehow, perpetuate their existence.\n\nTheir truest form of torture, I really believe, would be for us to hug them, tell them we understand their actions because they exist on a more dense frequency plane and are not as gifted/blessed as we humans, put them in a cell, feed them, clothe them, and kindly ask for their assistance in retelling history all over again from an honest beginning. Not that we can trust them...\n\nBut I'm sure someone/something will make it known to us what has been going on all this time so that the average man who hasn't been following all this unknown truth can make sense of it without being overwhelmed.\n\nAt the end of the day, it helps to remind ourselves that everything we have ever known and will ever know is One. So, these evil creatures are, in fact, us. We are all a part of the one-creator-self. And to know that these evil creatures are just a fascinating, brutal aspect of your own self makes it much more practical to avoid execution and, instead, substitute love.
Hell yeah. I'm horde and US. Will pm you in a bit :D
lol no. What I'm saying is that, to me, it's quite obvious that we are all the same thing. Why would I hurt anyone if I knew they are what I am? Even as a child, I never understood why adults made such a big deal of racism. Not that racism isn't horrible. That's blatant. What I'm saying is that by making such a big deal of it, we think it's worse than it really is. Do I want to bring back politically incorrect language? No. Silly question. That's nonsense. My point is that we separate ourselves even more when we remind ourselves, incessantly and over the top, about the separation that already exists. It gives us no time to fill the cracks; they only deepen. 
Right on. A firefighter who plays WoW! I love it! Adding ya now, brotha.
Theory: Those who know it's a scare and feed off of negative energy. Those who faked 9/11 to keep we the public in a perpetual psychological state of fear and anxiety. Because then there is no love. And when there is no love, these 'entities' in power get to thrive. Source: Max spiers

If you're the first, then you won't be the last. The push back may be to reinforce company culture. It may not be feasible, but if you get it it may only be on a temporary basis (meaning, you can do it for a few months until it's safe to let you go).\n\nBest to ask for 3 days a week of remote. That way you are still an onsite employee and the pushback shouldn't be as much.
Well the beginning of season 3 and end of season 2 were great for climbing to SR 2750ish. Had an 80%+ zen winrate going into season 3, it later dropped to 55% on zen for some reason. Not sure why, but it seems like Zen isn't as strong either at this time, and/or at higher SR. I think in low plat he is amazing because you can mow down the enemies who are stuck in  tunnel vision mode (people who shoot the person closest to them), while filling the healer role at the same time. But after awhile, those games where you are on fire the entire time start to diminish as people higher up in SR's know how to hit tab and find strengths/weaknesses in the enemy team comp and go to exploit them.\n\nSo I moved onto Lucio for KotH (aka Control point) maps. He does good damage actually and takes a more aggressive and mobile part in elims, whereas zen is more distant and rather passive in his elim assists, at least on KotH. I still pick him where he is really strong, payload attacking team and he is able to assist the team on a moving objective very well.
They'll never touch that because they probably own those brothels. And if guys can't blow off steam, they might turn their frustrations elsewhere like political demonstrations and they definitely do not want that happening. A lot of the sex tourist based brothels appear to have been bought by UK boiler room mafia, who used them to further launder their ill gotten gains. But, they do pay their dues to the police, etc. So maybe they shut down or stomp out some of these foreign owned ones when it is no longer as beneficial to keep them around?
>That doesn't necessarily mean that your Ana is shit, maybe you sat on healing all time instead of using speed boost more often, not only because it's more useful, but also to let your Ana farm her ult as well.\n\nIt's also possible that the lucio was being a little shit and trying to steal heals from the ana every single time (amping it up just to heal one person who would have been healed by ana, as to get more total healing points), just to get gold heals. As in, he literally played worst because he was playing a mini quest to compete with one of his own teammates in a metric that has no bearing on victory or the objective for that matter.

I've done well on KOTH with reaper (when he was a viable meta pick) and now Lucio. Lucio is super crucial for KOTH maps so... maybe a DSPTanky video will get you in the mood as lucio isn't that boring if done right.\n\nI think good general advice on KOTH is to group up and pocket people. I often follow roadhogs and pretend they are my body guard. Really though, what I am doing (as a DPS like reaper) is following them and using them as a sticky fly trap. When the enemy team member decides to rush the roadhog, I kill them while they are distracted and out of position.\n\nFor hog, I'm not sure he's that great (he isn't tier 1 and you and your SR are kind of used to playing a tier 1 hero) on KOTH as mobility is more important than area denial, since there aren't much in the way of chokes or corridors that fights get forced into. It seems like you don't like winston/dva, which is interesting because they are rather mobile heros. If you can get good with Tracer, she is very disruptive on KOTH and can sew enough discord against solo queue opponents to cause them to lose and sometimes tilt.

They might be throwing the match on the theory that their quick play MMR will carry over to their comp MMR. It won't (for non-new accounts, such as theirs obviously). But they might be so desperate and stupid to try anyway though.

It's because they are trying to calm him to prevent getting shut down. It's not like altruism, they just don't want him freaking out and having the city make an ordinance banning them. Here's Shrek chasing off a racist elmo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxxDkAkclw4\n\nFor more backstory, they put on costumes and demand tips for people who get pictures with them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCogsi4uxlM  ...the whole altercation between gangster batman and the guy was probably over tips.
I'm somewhat surprised Warner Brothers and Disney don't do something to ban this. The people who put on those costumes are homeless alcoholics demanding tips from tourists. So a hygiene disaster of a person is allowed to walk around in a piss covered $20 halloween ripped/torn costume and try to profit from Marvel/DC heros. That must be damaging their brand. How do they not act on stuff like this but spend so much money on tackling piracy (when people who are pirates will pirate anyway so the cost to stop them is quite high).
Also have it translated wouldn't hurt (the kind that can at least put some official stamp on it). The Thai police or any official Thai person would consider it much more seriously that way. And if it helps to explain the situation better that probably won't hurt either.

I think Lucio played in Numbani though. So although he is born and raised from Brazil, in the game lore, he may be more associated with Numbani. 
It's a corporation, not an art workshop. 10-20 people would never be in the budget. And by budget, I mean all the shareholders expected big returns and massive labor cuts.
>four decades after they were thought to be extinct in Thailand.\n\nWhat...? How is that even possible. Questionable reporting/editing again from Bangkok Post.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_cat - indicates it is from South East Asia and is nowhere near extinct (Least Concern). Seems almost contradictory. In fact, if you look at the map, it is clearly goes right into Thailand, thru both Laos and Myanmar. Gonna side with wiki on this, have seen so much bad editing on Bangkok Post.
>rape - unlawful sexual activity and **usually sexual intercourse** carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against the will usually of a female or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent—compare sexual assault, statutory rape.\n\nHistorically, the word rape always required vaginal penetration to be applicable (like how sodomy requires anal penetration to even be applicable in use). Understandably words change over centuries, but it's not anywhere near you custom definition bud.\n\nAnd yet you are asking others to get educated? Are you that much of a village idiot that you find "raping" the original meaning of a word to something completely different worth it? All this ignorance, just to win an internet argument?
>      \n> \n> This is so difficult to get through to people. Especially at lower elo people love to give up especially if we get rolled on the first half of the map.\n\nLol, I remember playing in season 1 and people would rage quit if say the first point of Numbani was taken too quickly. Funny how people are starting to realize the game isn't over until it's over. But it still seems most people decide the match in the first 30 to 60 seconds still. I think this is why my lucio winrate is so high, cause I make sure to speed boost my team on KOTH maps into superior positions and the enemy team seems to just give up after losing the first round (and getting staggered too of course, always speed boost to stagger).
Sounds good. Thanks for the reassurance.

I would rather it just not match anyone then. That would be ideal. Why force players into a coin flip where they can be pitted against players with better pings, just because a few exploiters? That's like using an HIV infected gauze to cover up a paper cut 0_o. Just, why force unexpected ping dis-advantages onto players who legitimately play from lesser populated places?

People keep reffering to the light skinned Chinese-Thai mix like they are the end all wanted goal of all Thais. Maybe I don't know, can't answer that.\n\nI can say though, there are very attractive, well above average dark skinned SEA women. They tend to date other SEA guys though as they are in demand, at least while they are still young and not mothers. Maybe they don't pair up with the richest or most handsome of the Bangkok Middle class (and why would they dive into a different strata like that anyway), but other similarly attractive Thai men do snatch them up, and they are mostly casually unavailable to falangs as a result of that. Mostly since most falangs don't speak the language and don't go looking for an actual locale, they go looking for a person who accommodates tourists. Because that's what they are used to, just like the hotels they stay in, they look for accommodation, safeness, familiarity, ease.
Yes of course. If you look at some of the causes, it would certainly be hereditary for some/most cases.
Scammers love to operate between nations because of how lawless transnational transactions can be. Unless they are moving large amounts of drugs or sex slaves, interpol isn't interested in shutting it down. So scammers like this can just make a lot of money anad never worry about arrest or civil suit/seizure.
Hence, why he's on the force. He isn't there to protect you, he is there to enforce the law, in favor of the rich and powerful. Who, by the way, he would never do that to without losing his job.

I heard sodium is a good thing if you stay in Thailand. Helps you to sweat more naturally and therefore fight the heat. As long you also drink enough water, then the increased blood pressure and sweating is good for the heat. Increased blood pressure because of vasodilation.

> a middle aged Isaan woman marrying a retired german guy will meet very different approval whether you ask some middle class Bangkokians or some Isaan farmers.\n\nWould it really though? Anymore than how much her lower poor/issaan status already bestows upon her? What is a poor isaan farmer expected of anyway, it seems marrying for money is the expectation and not the ruler breaker. So if anything, I reckon a middle-upper class woman (or man) marrying a poor retiree is what would see disapproval (from peers and just anyone else who would question her judgement and newly bestowed upon lower status).
Man, suburban white kids really lose their shit when they get arrested.\n\n>What are you doing, arrested me? What kind of police are you?\n\n>Fucking Nazi scum (as though this is comparable to Auschwitz)
Probably because google is so focused on intellectual capital, they only hire "the best." This means you have people with ivy league educations doing secretarial work all day. There is, I imagine, a lot of work that is unwanted but they only have super bright people to do it. Such as being a site reliability engineer on a core product versus working on a new project as a software developer. I imagine this creates competition for the best positions and leaves a lot of the unfulfilling ones open to new hires and those who aren't higher up on the food chain.
> again, are prepared to deal with these emotions, id say go for it.\n\nPrenups only protect against established assets. They cannot be used to sign away alimony rights or any property rights that are acquired during the marriage. They can be used to establish a line between what is husbands and what is wifes before the marraige. But if full disclosure of assets isn't done (Just 1 thing is missing), then the entire prenup is void. Getting a good prenup is expensive and will not prevent an even more expensive divorce (attornies, arguing over where exactly the line is to be drawn in the sand). It will only protect you if are you already kind rich.
> Ethan and Hila as leaning towards the alt right based on their videos.\n\nProbably because they don't toe the political line that they expect them to (as jews). It's quite racist really, expecting every jew to support Israel in every event, ever. As though each of them they aren't individual people with their own unique ideas and positions.\n\n>I think people are living in a separate reality where if you don't agree on everything they do you are literally as bad as Hitler.\n\nYep, that is exactly it. With us or against us. In my tribe or in the enemy tribe.
It can depends on solo queue versus 4+ groups, and on what the SR is slightly. And some KOTH maps are very different, such as Lijiang Control Tower (closed in, tight corners) versus Lijiang Garden (more open and favors range dps), few surprise corners.\n\nBut, in general, a lucio (and a decent one) is tier 1 easily. Soldier 76, even before the buff was ok on KotH because of his left shift mobility to get into position, it made him aggressive and effective. With the buff he is safely tier 1 on KotH. As for tanks, they are needed but none really easily make it to tier 1. As for advice on choosing a tank, it depends on your team's healing comp. Sometimes just 1 lucio and lots of mobile DPS is fine actually, in that case a Zarya/roadhog are available options because of their self sustain. So if there isn't an ana/mercy, Winston/DVA aren't as good because lucio/zen can't heal them back up as well. If there is an Ana, *and* she is decent, Winston/DVA would be the most suitable tanks because of their mobility. They work well with other flanking DPS heros like Genji. Sometimes rein is ok on Lijiang as it's a bit more choke point like there. Although, roadhog is decent on Lijiang Night Market.
How well can she speak English? Why is she able to speak English well? The answers are: much better than my taxi driver and I don't know, then she probably had a foreign boyfriend/husband before. Maybe more. Also kind of strange that she knows about prenups.\n\nAlso, did you meet her or did she meet you? If she met you, gold digger alert. Thai women don't just approach strange foreign men and speak in English about writing prenups and moving to a foreign land they (presumably) have never been to.
I read on here that people who just eat Thai food (not from 7, just normal cooked food) don't get enough sodium to deal with the April heat.

Awhile ago the first pro-tournament tiers put Tracer is a high pick on defense maps. Because she is able to keep the enemy team distracted, staggered, and takes a lot of time off of their objective, which is the whole point of defense.
Yeah well, google got in trouble price fixing developer saleries with other large tech companies. I think a little ageism is the least of all developers concerns.

Exactly. Discharging a weapon in public **is** a crime. Let him plead his case in court and hire a lawyer (such as pleading a necessary self defense case). If he cannot afford one, then one will be appointed for him. If this was **anyone else,** they would have to do the same.
Depends on what you mean by good. There are good hanzos that get POTG, gold medals. But it really comes down to a hanzo who goes in with the team and positions just right to be effective during the 6v6 fights.
Last sentence is really a good candidate for title gore. Glad it was deleted.\n\nBut overall, it was just a circle-jerky call to arms. Might as well name it "Upvote this to the front page if you think Darwinism is good, to help combat all the people who think it is bad."
He's easy to counter if he sits in predictable spots. I spend most of my time getting recon kills and baiting people who just love to nose dive in when they see me. Sadly, it eventually causes the enemy team to use coordination (scary thing in solo queue) and they win from that mostly.
> Even if it meant this south american team ended up playing in a north american server against 6 solo queuers (they would get a 130ms ping, which is not that bad).\n\nNo. One of the teams will have a ping advantage. Data centers aren't just located at the halfway point between every possible combination of players in the world who play overwatch.
> There is nothing "competitive" about this match up. \n\nExactly. Comp just seems like what quick play should be. And quick play seems more like arcade. I think overwatch is mostly for casual players and I anticipate more than 50% will be playing custom surfing games soon. Same thing happened with tf2 after people got bored of vanilla settings.

So??? Hillary Clinton **herself** has illegal, secret contact with foreign officials all the fucking time and almost became president. She even attends the fucking bilderberg meetings, in person. Which is clearly illegal according to the Logan Act. **Now all the sudden, non-ellected officials doing this and it's an issue, when ellected officials are doing this right now!?!?!!?**
Exactly. She isn't a counter, simple as that. If Sym has to guard her nest, and sombra is hunting for it, sym's TP/SG is providing a benefit while sombra is useless.

Mage, 1 Mana: Skip your next turn. The next turn you play will be 2 turns (note: this prevents stacking to infinite turns or just taking 3 turns which would be enable really cheesy "combos").\n\nThe idea would be that you have to hunker down with Ice Block/Ice Wall or just whatever minion freezing spell. But you would gain back the tempo later. I decided it to be a mage card because they remind me of the Blue element in MTG and they have the "Gain an extra turn" card (see: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201135).
Not sure why this is getting downvoted. It's true. They post pictures of every guy they can on their facebook page, even if it's multiple different guys over the course of months. If you consider that these guys are walking ATMs, then their facebook feed is basically littered with ~~old white guys~~ ATMs.

Well, it's not an overall net gain to your dust economy. But it's still a decent return on your fun economy.
Yeah, I noticed something was off when people would start showing up in the comments section of news stories claiming to be involed and how the report was 100% the opposite of what was written in the article (revealed in the comments). EG: Tourist woman gets beaten somewhat severely in a bar, official news says she was drunk and got in a fight, but she's on the blog claiming it was the bar staff that attacked her over her questioning a ridiculously high bill.\n\nSome of the news blocks (like stickboybangkok) are actually owned by boiler room mafia/brothel owners. Like when Andrew Drummond was reporting on one of them, stickboy did a very flattering "interview" with one of the boiler room bosses. I say "interview" because I wonder if it was really a dialogue and not just his monologue directing the entire thing with his henchman that runs his blog.
Or sexism, or some other systematic secret club of oppressors holding him/her back.
Also people love to play that deck. As soon as MSOG released, it was the top played deck by a huge margin. It only died down (and it took awhile at that!) because of how bad the meta was for it. And yet, people still are playing it quite a bit, even right before the nerf announcements. This is why so many people play pirate warrior/shaman, to farm all the jade druids.
>four decades after they were thought to be extinct in Thailand.\n\nWhat...? How is that even possible. Questionable reporting/editing again from Bangkok Post.\n\nedit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_cat - indicates it is from South East Asia and is nowhere near extinct. Seems almost contradictory. In fact, if you look at the map, it is clearly goes right into Thailand. Gonna side with wiki on this, have seen so much bad editing on Bangkok Post.
Yes and no. Sombra is detected by turrets and as long as the sym isn't a newbie she'll guard her nest and mow down the incoming (and detected) sombra.
I'd rather it find no match. I think with regards to competitive, the match should be equal. Unequal skill is adjusted for in the final MMR adjustment. If the match maker pits someone against a lesser team (occasionally), then the expected winning team doesn't get much of an MMR boost at all.\n\nBut as someone who plays in SEA, the idea of allowing players to mix up their pings is really bad, in competitive anyway. I really enjoy the fact that everyone has a near same ping and it really makes the matches fair from an equipment stance.
There's plenty of meat on the bone for ware and charles. They can both do a lot of damage on 15 touches.

Hill had over 1000 yards from scrimmage and 9 tds. He was fine in round 6. Granted, if you thought he was an every week start then you got hosed, but if you plugged and played in favorable matchups then you most likely got good value out of that pick. 
Oh please, we've always been at war with Eastasia. 
While a smear campaign is certainly possible and this Pieczenik individual has training in psychological warfare, I believe it's at the very least reasonable to say these allegations warrant further investigation.\n\nSpeaking of a double standard regarding evidence, proof, or the lack thereof, mainstream media is pushing the concept of Russia hacking the US in order to alter the outcome of the election, but where is the evidence in this case? \n\nIt's reasonable to remain skeptical whenever I see attempts to discredit these investigations when the only evidence I've seen from MSM sources is frankly an appeal to authority. The same authority I might add that convinced us to invade a country on the basis of weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. That's indisputable no matter what bias any of us may hold. 
This defense is overrated. They're good, don't get me wrong, but if you look at their schedule you will see that they basically beat up on bad teams (browns twice, jags, jets), as well as teams that lost star playmakers on offense. Gio, AJ Green, Decker, big Ben's first week back from injury and possibly more that I've missed. \n\nI'll admit Brady lost a star playmaker, so there is that, but the patriots are an excellent team and the Raven's defense didn't exactly light it up versus Dallas. I think Brady will have a serviceable/good game and I wouldn't bench him unless you have an embarrassment of riches at the QB spot. 
Conservatives actually were on board with [TPP](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/opinion/obama-and-republicans-agree-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership-unfortunately.html) until Trump came along. \n\nTPP was full of [issues.](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) Notably, threats on intellectual property and digital rights. 
Yes, I'm familiar with John Ashe's death. I've stated in another comment in this thread that I believe his death warranted further investigation. However, even if his death seems suspicious and appears to have a high correlation to Clinton, it does not prove anything. What we can demand is investigation and coverage to these issues and if it won't be provided we will be forced to seek it out on our own.

Greatest president ever? Wow guys, have you paid attention to the world around you? How many wars and multiple trillions into debt have we continued to get ourselves into?

Keep drinking the koolaid.

I wouldn't be disheartened. 20 is an early age to reshape your belief system. I was no better when I was 20 even though I thought I was open minded. I think it's great just seeing young people willing to challenge themselves to understand the world around them. \n\nThe biggest problem I see is the vast majority of the baby boomer generation seems unwilling to break away from tv or newspapers funded by multi billion dollar corporate conglomerates. After the things they've seen over the past 20 years they should know better than to put their faith in these news sources. 
Remember the telescreen in 1984? Keep in mind a cellphone spies on you too...
It has to do with gambling. Draft kings and fantasy pros are a fraction of what they used to be. The correlation is not complicated because most game are not very interesting unless money is involved, but it isn't like the NFL would look good from a PR standpoint to mention this...

Did the robber fire the gun twice into your head? If someone is found dead with two shots to the head and happened to work for an organization that had a major data breach, would people wonder if there was a motive? Would it warrant a serious in-depth investigation? Is it strange that Wikileaks offered a $20K reward for information regarding the murder of Seth Rich? Also, why did the media report the murder as a robbery when there wasn't evidence of a theft? Case closed I guess. 
Is that so? What's being done with the patriot act? The middle East? NSA spying on US citizens? Yeah the establishment sure seems to be in its death throes. 
Worst move: drafting Lamar Miller and Allen Robinson with my first two picks. \n\nBest move: not starting them towards the latter half of the season and ultimately winning the championship. 
I wouldn't freak out. Pats look incredible on both sides of the ball. A lot of qb's would've been embarrassed. 
Just to clarify, are you saying if a REIT hypothetically sold a condo it would count as rental income? I'm confident this would be considered investment income for a REIT and would not qualify as rental income (this can be fine as long as it is de minimis). My point about mentioning REITs really has nothing to do with how they function for investors, but what type of properties they are allowed to create. In this case, office buildings, warehouses, multi-family (apartments to be specific) which I believe is contributing significantly towards a shift to apartments rather than a condo market for individuals - especially in highly desirable markets. \n\nBy the way, it's NET income that REITs are required to return to investors (at the minimum 90% rate you mentioned above). Rental income is first offset against operational expenses of the portfolio before distribution to shareholders. Otherwise they would bleed money too rapidly. Your point is still valid though as REITs regularly have to raise capital, but if the REIT manages good FMV returns relative to their peers then can be as simple as selling stock units to investors.

What is not hidden cannot be found. Let that sink in. By the way, you are attempting to intervene. 
I agree there is a tremendous amount of suspicion surrounding his death, but to assert any claim that Clinton called for his death only serves to discredit the merits of your post. However, drawing attention to Seth Rich's name and the lack of investigation into his death certainly points out a strange silence by the media.

OP, I think a better way to approach this issue is to ask whether there is enough circumstantial evidence to warrant an official investigation. \n\nI would not doubt investigations have begun on flimsier evidence than pizzagate. So if there is no investigation going on then that may be the real issue that stands out. \n\nWe've already seen pizzagate censorship on Reddit, maybe some of it was legitimate, but censorship makes people want to look into something further as it appears there is something to hide.

You'd be surprised. I felt the same way you did, but while there are a large number of millennials who unquestioningly trust in everything big government, there are just as many who don't subscribe to MSM, or the two party political system and actually find the government quite untrustworthy. This is in large part due to many millennials finding their entry into the workforce, (or place in society) difficult, not to mention those impacted by their service in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nIf anything, I have found most baby boomers to think within the confines of MSM and two party politics.  I struggle to have philosophical conversations with this group that are not rooted in the "journalism" of the MSM (both left and right forms of it) and framed by the political arguments presented by the left and right. \n\nI actually have more faith in the psyche of the millennial generation to question the world around them independently, but they may end up being a financially weak generation due to astronomically increasing debt and with the continuing onslaught of automation limiting their economic freedom and associated ability to effect change. \n\nIf millennials are complacent and do nothing about the system, then there will come a time when most of their skills have been made obsolete and and their only perceived alternative is universal basic income. I could see the next step of forcing a digital economy to be all part of the game. So in this sense, you would be right. 
12 team ppr league I was last pick and drafted Lamar Miller and Allen Robinson with my first two picks and managed to win the championship so it's not over til it's over.

Great information, but I recommend linking the [book](http://911-truth.net/other-books/Muammar-Qaddafi-Green-Book-Eng.pdf) in your comment.
If I've personally upset you here that wasn't my intention, but I mentioned the phone as part of a list of inconsistencies as to why I thought the official conclusion was weak. Seth was murdered and the official investigation determined it was a robbery-gone-wrong. The problem is he had his credit cards, cellphone and watch when they found him (I actually left out the credit cards by accident the first time in my haste). So where, I ask, did the robbery theory come from? Why should it be accepted as the answer to this investigation? \n\nI'm actually not asserting that the cellphone is some sort of smoking gun evidence. I just ask why there isn't further investigation for such a weak conclusion? Perhaps a deeper investigation would still prove the original theory.\n\nFurthermore, I asked why did this story just die in the media? Does that make sense?

Ah yes, the 'ol appeal to authority logical fallacy. Sorry, we're not interested in taking our news from an incestuous conglomerate of multi billion dollar corporations. \n\nUnthinking respect for higher authority is the greatest enemy of truth. 
The initial goals of using 9/11 as a false flag were as follows. (This is by no means a complete list).\n\nUsing fear to pass laws that strip away our freedom and weaken the Constitution.\n1) Warrant-less Wiretapping, Domestic Spying (Patriot Act).\n2) Torture, kidnapping and detention of anyone deemed an "enemy combatant" without charge. \n3) Surveillance Society - NSA data collection (your comment about ushering a new era of government authoritarianism received a shot of adrenaline with 9/11).\n4) Real ID - laying the foundation for a national ID card (again an authoritarian threat).\n\nGovernment:\n1) Donald Rumsfeld stated on September 10th that they were unable to track 2.3 trillion in (military) transactions.\n2) The entire auditing team researching the 2.3 trillion were killed in the Pentagon attack on September 11. (Cover-up).\n3) The US Military budget was slated to be cut in half in 2001. Instead it doubled after 9/11.\n4) Strategic control of Oil in the Middle East and maintaining the petrodollar. (Countries that have or attempted to abandon the petrodollar: Iraq, Syria, Libya, Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea). Word is, Russia and China are pulling out of the petrodollar as well.\n5) Israel's neighboring enemies were either destroyed or significantly weakened by the US.\n\nCorporate (why not make money on something you know will happen?):\n1) US Military Complex profited tremendously from the wars in the Middle East and continue to do so. \n2) Halliburton & KBR earned $17.2B in revenue between 2003-2006 in a no-bid contract for services relating to the Iraq war. (Cheney was the CEO of Halliburton up until July 25, 2000).\n3) Salomon Smith Barney, the US Secret Services, as well as the Securities & Exchange Commission were located in WTC 7. (Salomon Smith Barney was a giant in the bond market and the destruction of building 7 served to cover-up the settlement and refinancing of [fraudulent 10 year Durham/Brady Bonds](https://kendoc911.wordpress.com/wtc-7/why-building-7/) which came due on September 11). These bonds may have been worth as much as $300B as the SEC temporarily injected $300B into the US money supply while settling these securities.\n4) American Airline & United Airlines (the two airlines hijacked) were part of a controversy regarding insider trading allegations. 5 days before the attack, over 2,000 contracts (90 times more than over a 3-week period) were purchased against United, betting its stock would drop. On September 10, a [surge](http://911research.wtc7.net/sept11/stockputs.html) in puts were also sold on American Airlines. \n\nIn your last sentence you expect a false flag from Russia in order to make a power grab. Let's just say we have already seen a false flag take place in order to make a power grab as stated above. Maybe the next one involves Russia, or Iran, or maybe it's another economic collapse. We don't know the timing, or who the actors will be, but we should pay attention and maintain reasonable skepticism.

I don't like kickers in fantasy, but I prefer kickers on teams with very good defense and a poor red zone offense. \n\nBrandon McManus last year was a great example of this. I think the injury to Bridgewater increases the likelihood that the Vikings won't be able to complete drives so Blair should have more opportunities for kicks. 
The redesigned UI is much worse from a practical use perspective, and unfortunately it's ugly. \n\nThe scrolling bar at the top for "Dashboard, New, etc." looks like it was thrown in as an afterthought and wastes valuable real estate. It doesn't go away when you scroll down, and it could be eliminated entirely and moved to the side bar, which currently has largely useless information. \n\nThere could be expandable menus for several of the categories in the side bar to make space for links related to the scrolling bar on the top. "Help, Send Feedback, Rate this App, Credits, Account Key" do not require direct access, and to make matters worse this side bar is buggy and often unclickable.\n\nThe red on white theme does not look pleasant, and somehow space is wasted in every way imaginable compared to the old app. At the very least, there should be an option to reduce the font size.\n\nThis app looks like it was built by a committee of marketing people pumping Toyota, DFS, Fantasy Shop, etc. We all gotta make money, but I will not be recommending Fantasy leagues to use Yahoo with the direction the app has taken.
I'm surprised there seems to be no mention of REITs in this discussion. It's my understanding that the North American REIT equity market capitalization is over $900 billion. One thing to keep in mind is REITs have fairly strict tax rules which obligate their real estate portfolios to derive at least 95% or so of their income from rental income (I could be off as I am not up to date on REIT tax rules). \n\nKeep in mind condos wouldn't count as rental income. Any profits on condo sales would be treated as investment income and break REIT status which would have major tax consequences on the portfolio. \n\nThe big picture is most of the high-end rental developments you see are basically funded by REITs or possibly REIT related partnerships and forced into rental arrangements due to the tax rules. REITs have a lot of capital behind them because they act as a pass-through investment vehicle to shareholders. \n\nEven if developers wanted to make condos the tax rules pigeonhole these large REITs into building property that can only be rented out. There's probably deliberate reasons as to why the government maintains tax rules that steer people into rental property versus ownership, possibly to keep property values high, just a speculation. Anyway, my two cents on the matter. 
I interpreted your title as self deprecating humor rather than a humble brag. Geared player requesting help from a beginner. It wasn't complicated :)

The only nefarious activity going on is by the people attempting to hide the truth. If this was all a hoax and there was nothing to hide then \nwhy go through all of this incredible effort to intervene? \n\nA fairly intelligent man once said "unthinking respect for higher authority is the greatest enemy of the truth." We are witnessing the wisdom of his words in these times.  
TPP was a threat to [digital rights](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) around the world no matter what your political leanings are. Good riddance. 
Whooooosh
Wow, cool concept. I'm about 860 with legendary bracers and pull 320k+ dps on live (no time warp), but with a similar build and rotation was only managing 240k dps on the ptr. I didn't think to try the combo you mentioned so it would be interesting to see if I could come close to my live dps. I had basically given up hope at this point on my fire mage. 
I did not state that. I said he was testifying on bribery charges with regards to the Clinton Foundation. Bribery charges is what he would be testifying against. His testimony, if proven true, would have been a bribery involving the Clinton Foundation.\n\nLet's put it this way, if you were an Olympian for the U.S. and were accused of taking steroids and had to testify, are you saying you are testifying against the U.S. Olympic Committee? No, because while your testimony may hurt the U.S. Olympic Committee you are testifying regarding whether you took steroids.\n
Huge bump for Hyde. Game should be close and Cardinals defense will likely be on the field a lot which will wear them down.

The critical variable that changed was QB. Hopkins was getting it done with Hoyer and a couple other average QBs. Hopkins can't do much with a low end QB. 
Whoooooosh
Do you think VR could be the place for everyone to go? \n\nIf automation replaces our ability to work, then I could see the prospect of VR replacing the loss of our original existence, while hopefully managing to greatly expand upon it. \n\nAssuming the masses have some sort of basic income to meet their food/housing/utility needs, (all brought to us by the automated technology that took our jobs in the first place), then we're off to a pretty good start. Your leisure time isn't limited to income (hopefully), since it can be simulated on the cheap, and theoretically paid for by your basic income. Exploration, fantasy, sci-fi, nature, and of course adult entertainment is all there, and brought to you in a far more environmentally friendly format.\n\nIf you've been on the losing side of the current game of life, you could be a winner once the ceiling is lifted. Maybe you're old, sick, invalid, poor, or simply bored... seems reason enough to participate. All said, maybe this is a dismal reality (assuming the one we're in is even reality), but it seems to me we've backed ourselves into a corner and this scenario could play out as a more optimistic outcome.
I wouldn't expect as much from Charles for the first 2-4 weeks of the season, maybe only 15 touches a game and disappointing production compared to what he used to put up. I drafted Charles AND Bell, so I figure on having a rough start to the year, but hopefully everything is clicking by week 4 and Charles is looking like his old self.
JC is ready for a huge load and then he'a going down on everybody!!!
Don't drop him. Learn to start players based on their matchup. Hill should not be your every week starter but I promise you he will do well against the browns and Washington over the next two weeks. If you still want to unload him after a couple good weeks go for it but you'll be able to get trade value then. 
Actually, [Lockheed Martin](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/niallmccarthy/files/2016/05/20160530_Defense.jpg) by a mile. Northrop Grumman is a big player, but they by no means call all the shots. Expand your focus, otherwise this post comes off as an isolated smear of NG that has an agenda versus a logically consistent critique of the entire US military industrial complex.

What enchants do you have?\nMark of the hidden satyr gives me 3-5% more damage. Then there's the standard ring and cloak enchants for more crit. \nMy shock baton trinket adds another 4-5%\nIf you don't have blast furnace on your artifact that's another 1%. \nI feel like I'm missing something, but the legendary bracers make a big difference. Probably 15% or so, but that's just a rough estimate. \nOther than that I'm itemized at 60% crit and 15% haste (haste is a bit more useful if you have the legendary bracers). 
I appreciate your responses, but I believe your understanding is not correct. First off, the sale of a condo would be a prohibited transaction in a REIT structure and the net income from the transaction would be taxed at a 100% rate. Also, your description of distributing 90% of the rental income is not accurate and would result in bleeding money. The dividend distributions are a net income calculation. Trust me on this. Now you could create a taxable REIT subsidiary if your REIT has some prohibited income and this would be taxed like a regular corporation. 
I remember when our intelligence officials said there was no doubt Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq was a national security threat to the United States, and was a threat to the peace and security of the Persian Gulf region. \n\nSave your appeals to authority for some other sucker. \n\nEDIT: An appeal to authority does not substitute as evidence (MI6, "intelligence", Russian officials, etc). On the surface it may appear to increase the credibility of a document, but at the end of the day it must be upheld to the same standards of any information or news that attempts to consider itself verifiable as evidence.
He should fit in just fine at our propaganda networks then. 
While this is a great timeline and I've heard similarly how many in the CIA did not support the message/evidence proclaimed by the Bush administration, it still doesn't change how the information was distorted in its delivery to the plebes. \n\nUsing an admittedly left-wing source, I think we can agree this is what our big shots actually [said](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/07/07/iraqs-weapons-of-mass-destruction-who-said-what-when/). To me, this article includes many intelligence officials, which is why I wrote the post above. \n\nPerhaps agents in the CIA are not really the element I refer to directly as intelligence officials here? However, I'm going to be the last one who accepts their testimony at a mere mention of the brand. \n\nEDIT: This was supposed to be a response, but it's a pain in the ass on my phone. 
I think people are underrating him after a bad rookie year. Ertz is hurt as well so he makes a good flex play against the Bears imo. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets at least 8 targets. 
Rams defense is not overrated. See Robert Quinn, back for 2016. 
Pepperidge farms remembers. 
I think he could get some good garbage time stats, but definitely not a sure thing
I would've included this except this war seemed to be directly in US interests. 
Where is the evidence of a sloppy shakedown gone bad? Is your proof simply speculating that after the robber shot him multiple times and ran through his pockets they probably got spooked? \n\nSo, what is the agenda here? Demanding further investigation? Trying to verify what happened to Seth? Your appeal to Rich's family is ironic as well. You can see [Seth's father](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vLAeTN960Q) on video saying “If it was a robbery — it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money — he still has his credit cards, still had his phone so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life.”\n\nIf there is any politicized agenda, it may be that Seth was indeed the insider informant to Wikileaks and that further investigation would disprove the allegation (also without evidence) that Russia had hacked into this information and released it to Wikileaks in order to influence the election.
I know some conservatives were against it for this very reason. Regardless, it was a bad deal. Politicians from Bernie to Trump were opposed to it.

I continue to predict the US will completely close it's borders by 2020. Citizens will not be allowed unrestricted travel.   
He also did not say you can't travel faster than the speed of light. He said and proved you can't travel AT the speed of light. FTL equations work just fine. 
They were good kids until they lost their mother. Then jug-ears charlie and his shitty father Phil the Greek taught them to be as just smarmy and self absorbed as the rest of the royal leeches. 
This is a good defense strategy. Of course they do not have $7M and as their pensions are exempt from seizure they will never have to pay anything if they can spin out the appeals long enough which any decent lawyer can do. 
What's obvious is there has not been a true investigation of several key individuals. (This is by no means a complete list either). \n\nSeth Rich - shot twice in the head, worked for the DNC as the voter expansion Data Director. Wikileaks tweeted a $20k reward for information on his murder following his death in July 2016. The official "investigation" determined it was simply a robbery gone wrong. (His watch and cellphone were still on his body.)\n\nedit: I don't know where I read shot twice in the head. This is factually incorrect and I apologize for this.\n\nEric Braverman - ex-CEO of the Clinton Foundation. Missing since October 2016. Emails from Wikileaks showed Podesta suspected he was a [Mole](https://wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/25357)\nSnopes "debunks" his missing status by simply stating he has not used his twitter account since October, is still officially listed as a teacher at Yale and is not listed as a missing person in the NamUS database. \n\nJohn Ashe - UN General Assembly Chief - dies June 2016 in a "weightlifting accident" according to the official investigation one day before he is to testify on charges of bribery with regards to the Clinton Foundation. \n\nGareth Williams - MI6 - was found dead inside a padlocked bag August 2010. Death ruled by the metropolitan police as an "accident". It was reported that he had hacked into sensitive information relating to Bill Clinton. \n\nLet's see the mainstream media demand to find out what is going on here rather than accept the current narrative. 
If you're going to spend that much, I would recommend a much better graphics card. The 1050 is weak at that price point. \n\nThis [MSI laptop](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J66BX1I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_DQpLybVJKXF4Q) has a 1070 (way more powerful than a 1050) and has a lot of similar components to your link above for about the same price. \n\nThe main knock on it is the size of the SSD, but there's a couple options. Pay $1650 and buy a bigger SSD separately or pay $1695 for a 256GB SSD and upgrade it down the road. A worthwhile sacrifice in exchange for picking up a graphics card over 2x as good. 
They'll be good this week. 
Why limit the discussion to Northrop Grumman? Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics are even [bigger players](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/the-top-9-biggest-defense-contractors-in-america-2016-5?client=safari) in the US military's industrial complex. 
Fair analysis, but why mention the bye week? Every player has a bye week so what difference does that make...

For more than fifty years Jewish scholars have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to document each Jewish victim of the Nazi Holocaust.  The Nazis were German, obsessed with paperwork and recordkeeping.  Yet only 3 million names have been collected and many of them died of natural causes.  So why is it heresy to doubt that fewer than 6 million Jews were murdered in the Second World War?  
As i see it they were abandoned by the CIA and only got out after they did their time. 
So many wrong facts in one thread - should be a reddit record. 
It's fast but it's clearly not 2 seconds. Human reaction time cannot complete some of the tasks required in 2 seconds.

There is always some idiot trying to game the system. Usually ends up taking more time and effort than just doing it the regular way. 
An extremely unlikeable and aggresive man wth an enormous chip on his shoulder about just about anything Japanese. Like a rabid dog will attack anyone who has any independent thought.  To be avoided.

Nothing will happen. A few long dead MP's will be named but nobody of any consequence. Jimmy Savile will be named and a few 60s pop stars. And that's it. Former Prime ministers and members of the 'Royals' are untouchable.  
He was helped onto the skids by Don King
Suspected would not be the right word. They were out and out Nazi sympathizers as was (and is) most of their family up to today. 
I used KAt but it's a nice opportunity to see all the alternatives around. Actually it's sort of a blessing that Kat has gone. Chance to spread the word about so many other sites. Thanks feds.  
I am sure he will win. His dumbbell brother won (or seemed to win) twice despite knowing nothing about anything relevant. The US public just doesn't care enough to do anything about it. Just as long as Dancing with the Stars is on their 60" TV.  
Can you prove what you have written or is it just made up fantasy. I live in Japan and have for many years. Where does you friend live? what's his name? I'd like to interview him.

The more you read about 'string theory' the more you realize it's nonsense that sort of works until something better comes along.  
That's it. Keep on calling names.  Do you read Japanese or Korean?  I do but if not then start here http://www.uba.ar/ceca/newsletters/mayo_09/nl-nota1-english.php.  You will also find several progressive Korean writers willing to tell the truth about how the current and previous South Korean right wing has cooked up this completely minor issue to blackmail Japaneses business in Korea. You can throw in the Glendale statue erected to the memory of these so called women which has been again exploited by the Korean govt to lever the current Japanese govt into another apology (making number 32 by my reckoning) I could go on but then again I know the subject and you, well you, read Wikipedia and believe everything written there. Good luck.  
I've seen that. It's Stupid. 
You'd think reddit's 'friends of Israel' would have enough made up embarrassing Hitler stories by now, but no here's another bullcrap story. 
I totally agree. He always comes off as a holier than thou dick. If he's a teacher I wouldn't want to learn anything from him. 
Totally misleading title. It doesn't take 4.4 trilion frames per second. How old are the posters round here to actually post such a piece of crap. 
It's Ally McBeal and not really that funny. 
I look forward eagerly to the information. Gaijin who carries a gun in Japan - Wow. 
Watched this. I'm sure someone somewhere can make use of this bit of knowledge but actually on a practical day to day basis it's useless  What amazes me is people can actually get paid to do this. 
The wire is crap. Drugs and Ghetto. That's it. 
Yes but he did get the 2 nuclear bombs the US dropped on Japan.  
 I don't see why it's so difficult. The Lone Ranger does this all the time.
Let's straighten that out shall we. Officially The Japanese Judge (who clearly didn't want to have anything to do with the case) accepted McCartney's lawyers argument that McCartney never actually entered Japan (no entry stamp in his passport) and therefore didn't actually smuggled anything. He was not deported but simply refused admission. This legal argument had never been accepted before and has never been accepted since. It worked because he was Paul McCartney of the Beatles (nobody cared about Wings)  
Watch the 4 minute mile and then read what an event that was.

My question would be is there a limited then to the speed of light in water? I suppose there is but if the universe were in water FTL travel would be possible right? Hmm - my question makes my head hurt. 
I sincerely and honestly wish dueling was still an option. I could have solved so many of my social and personal problems. Win or lose my problem would have been solved.   
I imagine it's like George Bush attaching Iraq and killing thousands of civilians and hundreds of US troops because he though Saddam tried to kill hid Dad. 
Yes. I can't get into the wire. Just drugs and drugs. \n\n
How do you figure? Someone coughs into his hand, touches a handrail that you touch, and then you rub your eyes.
Or the politicians in NH and IN.
Yes. You are right, I was confusing it with another excellent but hard to find book series 'The Eternal Mercenary' by Barry Sadler. I read it at the same time as the five fingers. I loved them both. \n\n..best part of all this is if you read the actual life of Barry Sadler it reads better than the plots of both books! \n\nAlso I wrote to him asking about his self defense video and he wrote back a really nice letter enclosing several pages of training material he planned to include in the video. Then he got shot in the head\n \n
You would think a small bit of pride would kick in and he would want to get a job but I guess 'any living' is better than working.  
Absolutely. I met him on 2 different social occasions and he's a outright tool. He can't hold a conversation about anything and just acts as if he's doing us all a favour just by being there.  
Again, that's what i thought so I checked and actually he was right. In theory they can turn in their own length but in the formation shown in wouldn't have worked.  but who knows for sure. We don't even know who the tankman was.  
See Movie of Talking Heads called "Stop making Sense"
Bandaids - who uses bandaids anymore Just a touch of Vaseline and you're good. 
...because lying under oath is a common legal start to most investigations. If you want to get someone on bigger charges you first get them to lie under oath (think Bill Clinton) - once you break them with that the rest comes easier. 
If you read or watched anything by Ebert you'd come away thinking he was a bit of a dick. I thought so too. Then one day he was doing a talk & book signing in Santa Monica. My then GF wanted to go so I went thinking it would be all about the great Ebert. But no he was exceptionally charming and engaging. Spent time answering everybody's question and took a few of the audience out to a local bar to 'talk' movies. I was very impressed. Nice guy.
OMG it's full of bananas\n\n

Two studies have confirmed that more than 72% of Americans are no more  than 2 paychecks away from homelessness.

Another wildly inaccurate factoid from the children at Wikipedia. 
Lots of trailers but I have never seen any actual footage. Does this movie actually exist?
Churchill was all for the idea. In fact he proposed rearming the German Army in 1945 and attacking Russia on three fronts including a possible nuclear attack by the US. 
So why did he say he would do it. 
This is of course utterly stupid and a complete fabrication and yet another of the let's say anything we like about Hitler because he was such a bad man.  At one time or another every giggle-worthy disease know to man (or in Reddit's case kids) has been attributed to Hitler.  
I thought he was a TV reality show guy.

Nah. He wimps out on the day. Total ripoff. But he never fails to promote red bull through the whole movie. It's a fake movie.  
When you write Ofc you mean you have proof. You have none, just something you made up to sound cool and you got called it. As the other guy says you are full of shit. 
Hey moron. Learn about South Korean politics and how this minor issue is exaggerated  to leverage Japanese investment in South Korean businesses. Jesus, I hate having to teach children like you who have never been further than bumfuck Ohio and believe everything they are told. 
Also Churchill disapproved of the open BSDM relationship they had. 
Politician believe you should work your way up from the bottom like they didn't.
That's similar to an idea that I was kicking around: making message boards ubiquitous. A board for your apartment building, for your block, for your clique at work. Seamless to create and lo frills.
The thing here is with time dilation as your speed increases time slows for you but not for everything else so say after a month or two of travel at near light speed the earth would have experienced a few thousand years - enough for technology too have advanced enough for those people to catch you up and tell you not to bother going on as they have already colonized all the nearby stars. It's basically time travel. \n\nI wish i could have explained that to the Interstellar writers. It would have been a more shorter movie (relatively speaking)

Despite several attempts to revise history by Japanese historians the actual melody for Kimigayo was written and noted as such by John William Fenton an Irish/Scottish bandmaster. I have read his musical score and it's identical to the current national anthem of Japan. Case closed. 
The simple fact is that this buffoon Trump is even a candidate proves that whoever is running the elections is just trying to see how far they can push it. I mean Trump as a candidate - who is going to believe that. 
The bit about 'a relative' is not true but McCartney's Japanese lawyer did show that Ono Yoko spoke for just under 50 minutes to the Japanese Airport authorities the day before McCartney arrived. No further information was available.  
Ahh yes I thought the same thing until I had it explained to me by a UK tank commander. The 2nd tank would have had to reverse it's own length to enable it to traverse behind and arouns the front tank. It couldn't because the 3rd tank was too close as was the 4th and 5th tanks. In essense they were a joined up train and didn't have independent action.\n\nWhether or not tankman knew that fact (who does) is not clear. \n\n

Again Fuck you all.

People have been saying that about Japan since I first lived here in the 60's. The 70s and 80's were great for business and the 90's were a good time to invest and buy land.

Other patterns to look for:\n\n- transactions with amounts involving magic numbers (eg, 0.0911) or or fixed-width interval (first address receives 0.001; the next, 0.002; etc.) to indicate message order.\n\n- less likely to be important but still worth noting -- transactions involving vanity addresses\n\nand i'd first exhaust looking through all transactions touching the transaction graph of known wikileaks addresses before expanding to unknown addresses.

Pieczenik was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance and James Baker.[3] His expertise includes foreign policy, international crisis management and psychological warfare.[7] He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.

You don't think it's possible he's aware of things you aren't?

Might not have had a choice. Everyone in these control systems comply because they get the choice of the carrot or the stick. No one ever chooses the stick.
Key section for me:\n\n> EVD is only the beginning and only one disease; even if we are to control the current epidemic, the future introduction of this and other highly contagious and virulent microbes to and from global slums is inevitable. It is not sufficient just to talk about poverty, lack of health-care access, cultural practices, etc. It will be impossible to stem this epidemic and prevent future epidemics of emerging diseases without addressing the underlying structural and socioeconomic determinants of disease unique to slums. Experts and politicians must acknowledge their existence now and divert resources towards improving the conditions of urban slums.\n\nPart of me thinks that a silver lining could emerge from all this. That governments recognize that it is in everyone's interest to lift the poor out of slums, and act on it. 
So they just opted not to release parts 2+? This whole thing stinks.

Actually this makes sense when you think about it. If you wanted to distribute the insurance keys in such a way that they could never be removed from the internet, sticking them into the blockchain would be a perfect way to do it. And, coincidentally, there was a huge attack on the bitcoin network right around the time that this would have happened.

So in other words you clearly have no idea what circumstantial evidence is. There's plenty here to warrant an actual federal investigation, which if successful would then provide the proof you're requesting.
Yes. Also, it would be helpful to have time series data on fees and how many transactions were outstanding in the mempool during the past two months.

I don't understand Charles Ortel's deal.

Yes. You assume that someone who isn't actively in government  wouldn't be able to know. (Pieczenik has claimed he still works for the government periodically on a consulting basis.)

This is the most recent poll, and the only poll since end of December, but it is not the only poll. It was a concerted choice to weight all polls besides this one at 0, and to leave this one a 0.42. If they felt like these numbers were poorly representative they could have not set the weighting of the earlier surveys to 0. *shrug*

Fourteen? That's one step after pedophilia, hebephilia (11-14), followed by ephebophilia (which is technically 15-19).

He was in the restaurant on the top floor of the North Tower when the first plane hit. He was scheduled to be at a breakfast meeting with Howard Rubenstein, the PR agent of the WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein. Rubenstein canceled at the last minute. He mentions the story in [this interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20071120001602/http:/www.lifestylesmagazine.com/website/past/stories/193/Lifestyle_10-2004_006.html), and on [this episode of the Charlie Rose show](https://charlierose.com/videos/1383) (part about 9/11 starts at 15:57).\n\nThe leaseholder, Larry Silverstein, also didn't go a breakfast meeting or his office in the North Tower. He says he had a dermatologists appointment we went to at his wife's insistence. Here he is telling the story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ScGZCqEyGM \n\n

I think the story about the handgun is BS (I think he's referring to James Files, whose story has been disproven several times), but some noise-suppressed rifles back then could sound like a hammer hitting a board hard, especially if combined with subsonic ammunition. Such a weapon could blend in to the noises of the crowd and motorcycle backfire. [Here's an example of an automatic rifle with a noise suppressor, used by the CIA](https://i.imgur.com/n7pE8NF.jpg).

Hard to not suspect that when he just got done defending the inappropriate relationships he's been in.

BoojumG, There could be endless debate about whether the Rydberg drawings show an accurate portrayal of the *large* head wound, and we know from the autopsy photographs that the back wound was placed too high on there. However, the autopsy professionals have always consistently maintained that the entry wound location on the autopsy report is correct, where that drawing shows it. \n\nI'm not saying there was more than one entry wound on the head. The large head wound could be tangential, meaning it's just one large hole a bullet made by striking the head at a certain angle. \n\n>It's not like there was a neat little hole in the back of an intact skull - the skull itself was shattered and had to be reconstructed. \n\nThe official records say that the occipital scalp and bone was intact until the autopsy doctors started chipping away bone fragments. It was a neat hole by all accounts. \n\n>I don't believe you have any evidence of any coercion, and I doubt your characterization of his story changing and changing back again is accurate. It doesn't make any sense anyway. If he was coerced and then later went back on those statements then he would also come forward about the coercion. I can then only wonder why you believe there was coercion in absence of any actual evidence of coercion, and it calls the reliability of your reasoning into doubt.\n\nHere is my evidence for Dr. Humes being coerced into testifying to the HSCA that the "higher" entry wound is true:\n\nhttp://www.history-matters.com/archi...ARRB_Purdy.htm\n\nThis is a 1996 AARB interview of HSCA staffer Andy Purdy.\n\nSkip to 31:29 of part one: http://www.history-matters.com/archi...B_Purdy_S1.mp3\n\nPurdy: "*During the course of that meeting, as I think the transcript shows, when they were- in fact, somebody said 'this shouldn't- we shouldn't even be recording this'. And* **I think it was Petty who took, I believe it was Humes, out of the room to basically set him straight. Basically 'you're just wrong, you're just clearly wrong, this is not something evidentiary'** *... And that's why they keep things on- is the whole thing altered or whatever. It's like Humes is lying, we don't even have to. Or he's mistaken, or he's being overly firm about something that doesn't have evidentiary signifigance. And unless he takes his stupid, incompetent position, which is the lower thing's the entrance hole. I mean, we're practically- he's practically down to the shirt.*"\n\nAlso:\n\nhttp://www.patspeer.com/chapter13%3Asolvingthegreatheadwoundmyster \n\n*In September 1977, when the HSCA forensic pathology panel showed Dr. Humes a photo displaying what they believed was the actual entrance hole on the back of the head, the small oval shape in the cowlick, Dr. Humes, who’d led the autopsy of President Kennedy and had repeatedly asserted that the hole was near the President’s hairline, responded “I don’t know what that is. Number one, I can assure you that as we reflected the scalp to get to this point, there was no defect corresponding to this in the skull at any point. I don’t know what that is. It could be to me clotted blood…it certainly was not any wound of entrance.”*\n\n*Well, this was not what the panel wanted to hear.*\n\n*In 1996 HSCA counsel Andy Purdy told the ARRB that after Humes made his comments about the panel's presumed bullet hole being nothing but "clotted blood," Dr. Charles Petty took Humes outside and yelled at him. And this wasn't just Purdy's fantasy. In a 2-20-2000 meeting with researchers, Dr. Michael Baden not only confirmed Purdy's story, but built upon it. He re-constructed Petty's words to Humes for dramatic effect, and had Petty call Humes a "God-damned jackass."*\n\n\n>Do you really know what you think you know about how brains are affected by bullets? That cerebellum looks plenty damaged to me anyway. What were you expecting?\n\nDr. Michael Baden, HSCA medical evidence panel staffer who pushed the higher-cowlick wound theory, himself said this in 1978:\n\n "...*And further, although the original examination of the brain was not complete, photographs of the brain were examined by the panel members, and do show the injury to the brain itself is on the top portion of the brain.* **The bottom portion or undersurface of the brain, which would have had to have been injured if the bullet perforated in the lower area as indicated in the autopsy report, was intact. If a bullet entered in this lower area, the cerebellum portion of the brain would have had to be injured and it was not injured. So that is the basis for what remains a disagreement between our panel and the original autopsy doctors.** *.... It is the firm conclusion of the panel members...that beyond all reasonable medical certainty, there is no bullet perforation of entrance any place on the skull other than the single one in the cowlick.*" \n\nI've said before, Baden just doesn't realize that this makes the next logical explanation that a bullet entered the original location of the skull, went down at an angle and only *grazed* the cerebellum, while not pummeling it. If this happened, the bullet would then hit the floor of the skull. 1990's ARRB testimony from Dr. Humes and mortician Tom Robinson does indeed suggest say that the floor of the skull was smashed. The most logical explanation is not that there was no wound there. \n\n\n

Upvoting this just to fuck with the world
To visualize what I mean here, this is a Warren Commission sketch of Kennedy made under the supervision of the lead autopsy surgeon Dr. Humes: https://www.history-matters.com/essays/jfkmed/How5Investigations/images/CE386.jpg\n\nThe entry wound is low in the head, behind the ear. \n\nThis is a sketch made by the House Select Committee on Assassinations medical panel, showing the "new-and-improved" location of the entry wound in the back of the head:\n\nhttps://a9536d41-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/jfkforum/hsca/dox/JFK%20F-307.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7cr8d7czoXLi5qUYRPtJiERgKmrII4ox5WVYaA1E5wwz5VTL9NvSRJuYveEfR-ZNuT6mGDdZAEYJxii0hZAj0r4TR0aG2HPDl-raa9lcbX6tesmzzCklcXeloyaWzNILppTLrftWUVKnd00FvkLATIZ9A3blbvdtXCaNPpN6LlngjWQ8WG_MqnMDjHI1Mnj9ib4BMp7DHP3UtRTkJihGybYLTLMrrJZ08R92CdH-Hg1PCSN7S_4%3D&attredirects=0\n\nThis is the autopsy face sheet showing a diagram of the wounds, the paper itself stained in Kennedy's blood: https://i.imgur.com/OEOI3Dg.jpg \n\nAnd this is the autopsy report itself, giving the precise measurement of the location, size, and shape of the entry wound as 2.5 centimeters to the right and slight above the external occipital protuberance, 15x6 millimeters (elliptical): https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-09.pdf\n\nKennedy's three autopsy doctors were Dr. Humes, Dr. Boswell, and Dr. Pierre Finck. Dr. humes and Boswell had never performed an autopsy on a gunshot victim before, however Dr. Pierre Finck (who had participated in hundreds of autopsies of gunshot wound victims) showed up towards the end of the autopsy and verified the face sheet and report. Kennedy's personal physician Dr. Burkley also personally verified and signed the autopsy face sheet/report. The measurements were taken by one doctor holding a ruler up to the wounds and verbally describing the wounds to another, writing it down. All three doctors described the same location for the wound in several testimonies, with the exception of when Dr. Humes was coerced into testifying to the HSCA that the entry wound really was that high (afterwards, he went right back on to insisting the autopsy report was correct in the wound's location). \n\nThere is also a very good case that a couple of autopsy photos of Kennedy's skull show the entry wound at a low location, just barely hiding in the shadows (what these photos actually show has been the subject of much debate): http://www.patspeer.com/chapter14%3Ademystifyingthemysteryphoto\n\nSo, in short, the official story relies on three or four medical professionals simultaneously making the worst mistake in their entire careers and persisting in a very false recollection of where the wound was located. Autopsy witnesses like Francis X O'Neil and Richard Lipsey also must have horrible memories because they described and drew diagrams of the entry wound in the same location.\n\nThe general public is not allowed to view all of the official brain photographs, nor do we have bootleg leaked copies like we do with other autopsy photographs. However, we have this sketch of one of the photographs released by the HSCA: https://www.sott.net/image/s1/20206/full/Figure_8.jpg \n\nNotice that the right cerebellum is only slightly damaged, not demolished like you would expect if a bullet smashed and tumbled into, and out of it. \n\nHere is the post-mortem X-ray of Kennedy's skull: https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6GwGOKCkHhw/UI2ctUubwiI/AAAAAAAAKM4/sijStlm_aL4/s1600/JFK-Xray-Lateral.jpg\n\nThere are no dark spots on the occipital area signifying a significant loss of brain matter. Here is the pre-mortem X-ray of JFK: http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/images/5/55/Photo_hsca_ex_297.jpg\n\n
Here's a link to the 2013 book *Reclaiming Parkland* which debunks a lot of stuff said by Bugliosi about the Kennedy Assassination: http://libgen.io/book/index.php?md5=42A5E4F79FC922F0682935F4FD7F55D3\n\nNote: This is a kindle ebook file. You will have to use it with the Kindle program. This is also the 2013 edition of the book, not the 2016 edition which has some minor additions like the chapter on Mexico City which can he read [here](http://feralhouse.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Oswald-in-Mexico-_-excised-from-Reclaiming-Parkland.pdf). 
Such a widespread conflicting description of the head wound could be explained by either a massive cover-up or some kind of optical illusion. I think that perhaps if Kennedy was laying down and had his held tilted back, the Parkland and autopsy witnesses could've thought that the wound was behind the ear, involving the occipital area. 
Wasn't Churchill a racist lunatic who starved 6 million Indians to death? Never looked into that very much, but it seems like a lot of credible sources believe it.
Furthermore, like I said, after Dr. Humes' HSCA testimony (which contradicted his earlier informal interview with them), he went right back to saying the entry wound was at the original low location in the head. \n\nHarrison Livingstone's 1989 book *High Treason* has an interview with Humes where he reverts back to the original location, with Livingstone writing "*He* (Humes) *was very strong on this issue*"\n\nThen, in 1992 there was a JAMA article targeted at refuting Oliver Stone's film JFK, which has Dr. Humes and Boswell saying the entry wound was exactly where the autopsy report said it was, near the external occipital protuberance.\n\nFinally, Dr. Humes, Boswell, and Finck all testified to the ARRB in 1996 that the original autopsy report's location for the entry wound was accurate, to the right and near the external occipital protuberance. 
Really? I did not know that. 
Dude, just Google it. It's not BS. Some are just more susceptible than others. 
I'm sorry, I don't buy what you're saying. Fuck historical figures like that, they shouldn't get special treatment.  
Would you believe Kennedy's personal physician? https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5u8nfi/rconspiracy_creates_fake_conspiracy_to_explain/ddsvvj6/\n\nYou say you can only see one headshot in the Zapruder film. Keep in mind that the bullet that struck near the external occipital protuberance did not damage a lot of the brain, it only made a hole in the scalp and skull. So a previous or second bloodsplatter would probably not be visible on the film, or even to a witness.\n\nIf you ask to pick a frame for when this extra headshot happened, the safe answer may be after the big headshot at frame 313. But at around frame 190-224, after he emerges from behind the sign, Kennedy's disoriented behavior is something you would expect from someone with non-fatal cerebellum damage. If he's trying to reach for his throat wound and point to it, he can't really seem to do it right, as if he suddenly became stinking drunk. 
We have more than enough evidence that Kennedy was shot in the head twice, once from behind and the second big one who knows. According to official medical records, the entry wound in the back of the head was an elliptical hole in the scalp and skull behind the ear, near the external occipital protuberance. However, we can see on the X-rays and brain photographs that the right cerebellum isn't torn open and heavily damaged as if a bullet tumbled through it and exited the top-right side of the head. The right cerebellum is only slightly bruised and "deflated". Therefore, I think that it is impossible to connect the small head wound and large head wound. I think basic logic says one bullet entered the back of the head, barely grazed the right cerebellum, and smashed the floor of the skull. What happened to that bullet after that happened is a different issue. The large hole on the top-right side of the head was caused by a separate bullet. \n\n[The general public doesn't have access to the official brain photographs, but we do have this sketch of one of them. The right cerebellum does not have the damage from a bullet completely entering it.](https://statick2k-5f2f.kxcdn.com/images/ctka/public/2015/images_demey/DoxBrain.png)
Can you guys clarify what you all actually think about gender-sex minorities? I feel like I'm walking on eggshells just listening to you guys when transgender subjects come up. I'm worried you're soft on bigoted ideas of GSMs. More than ever they need a voice to speak up for them, especially considering you guys may have a lot of conservative-ish fans who aren't sure about what they think of "transgenders", or some of them may believe in some garbage about "mental illness", which insults both GSMs and people with mental illnesses. You guys are an actual influential voice now. 
What kind of person appoints themselves guardian of their gated community? You gotta be nuts.
It's lighter. You feel less like you're drinking something less syrupy. 
I have doubts that hole was really there. If the head was tilted back while laying down, perhaps that could make an optical illusion where a hole on the top of the head looks like a hole in the back of the head? 
It has nothing to do with Comet Pizza.
Woah, that's a pretty lazy smorgasbord of ideas about JFK. 
I mean, there was no evidence of toxins in his system. And no evidence of any dart injury to the exclusion of a bullet or a fragment. I think it's more likely that his injuries were severe enough at the beginning of the shooting that he couldn't duck. 
Paul, have you seen the Joe Rogan clip where Milo talks about seeing Hollywood sex parties with young boys? Why did you guys not mention that at all? I think that's pretty fucked up, if it's a lie or if it's the truth.
Okay, well /u/caiaphas8 is saying "Yes". 
Oh man, why don't you fuckin' stop it? Shit, this is too fuckin' big for you, you know that? Who did the president, who killed Kennedy, fuck man! It's a mystery! It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma! The fuckin' shooters don't even know! Don't you get it?
*coughs, looks around awkardly* \n\nYeah, ads, man.
Stupid, stupid retard. Comet pizza has nothing to do with pedophelia. If you want to say there are high-level pedophile rings, let's talk, but literal pizza has nothing to do with it.
It is a thing. 
Paul, why are you defending this person? You guys didn't even mention the most important thing about Milo on Joe Rogan: He claimed that he attended Hollywood sex parties with other kids who were "very, very young", and proceeded to say that he would not name the high-level people at those parties. It could all be bullshit, but I think that's grounds for a visit from the FBI. If he's telling the truth, I think that qualifies as "supporting pedophilia". \n\nSurely you know that Milo is the gay version of Tommy Sotomayor, who is homophobic and transphobic?\n\nSurely you know that Milo believes in Pizzagate, which revolves around accusing other random people of child sexual abuse based on little to no evidence? \n\nSurely you know that Milo denies climate change caused by humans, an idea that jeopardizes the entire human race? \n\nSurely you know that Milo has called Bill Nye an "idiot" because he criticized creationism and climate change denialism?\n\nSurely you know about all of the stupid and incendiary shit that Milo has said that subtracts from the sum total of all human knowledge? Holy shit dude, and you're seriously close to crying on Periscope over this terrible, awful man. 
Can you make a space engine-type game that simulates a flat earth? 
DP acts like they're the ones that have the inside scoop on this Milo thing when they are actually ignoring 60% of the issue.\n\nOn Joe Rogan, Milo claimed that he attended Hollywood sex parties which featured kids *he* called "*very, very young*", and that he refuses to name the high-level people present.  It could be bullshit, but that's a pretty serious thing to just casually mention. That's the kind of thing I would realistically expect an FBI visit from. This isn't just an issue of what may or may not have happened to Milo himself. Did they just fall asleep during that part? 
I've never seen this. That's the creepiest thing ever, it just happens just a few seconds after they announce it. I know the fire chiefs were given an approximate time for when to expect a collapse from some mysterious strangers, but this is ridiculous. 
You may also wanna see this FBI memo, written at the time of the beginning of the autopsy, which casually mentions a bullet "lodged behind the President's ear": https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=707
You're assuming a lot. Sherry Fiester, forensic expert specializing in blood-splatter analysis, has said that the perceived forward head movement and forward blood splatter is actually evidence for a shot from the front. 
I understand how the witnesses are pretty unanimous in describing the head wound as being posterior. I'm wondering if so many of them could have thought the wound was behind the ear because it *was* behind the ear- from their point of view, with Kennedy laying down, head tilted back. I think you can prove a conspiracy either way, but I think you can do it without any of the evidence being faked. 
Yes, the brain was not properly sectioned as typical in gunshot wound cases, however I think you can prove two headshots (a conspiracy) with just the existing head X-ray and brain photographs. \n\nThe receipt you mention is here: http://aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md69/html/md69_0001a.htm\n\nIt simply refers to a "missile". When questioned about this decades later, the FBI agents Sibert and O'Neil claimed that by "missile", they just meant two small bullet fragments. \n\nThere is no way of knowing the throat wound was an entry of a dart, to the exclusion of a bullet entry or a fragment exiting. Some are convinced that a whole bullet could exit and leave the wound a tiny 4-5 millimeters like that. \n\nThe Parkland hospital doctors performed a tracheotomy at the location of the bullet hole, by Dr. Perry's statements he incised it *below* the throat wound. There is some controversy over whether the large gaping neck incision noted at the autopsy was the same incision the doctors at Parkland hospital made. According to researcher David Lifton, Dr. Perry was shown an autopsy photograph of Kennedy's face and neck for a CBS interview, to which he shook his head and said "*I left the wound* **inviolate**", meaning that you could still see the basic outline of the throat hole beneath the neck incision. A copy of the audio tape for this CBS interview was allegedly altered by someone to make Dr. Perry sound like he said "*I left the wound* **invalid**", meaning the exact opposite. Lifton has a new book coming out soon so maybe he'll tell the full story and prove all of this then. 
If it's true, I don't wanna hear stupid cute anecdotes about Chirchill. Awww Churchill had depression and called it 'my black dog' well guess what he starved 6 million Indians to death cus he didn't give a shit lol
A tangential wound is when a bullet does not leave any clearly identifiable small entrance or exit, it just creates one big hole. It's like an entry and exit wound combined into one big mess. JFK's large head wound could be tangential, having no relation to the small wound near his external occipital protuberance. 
Switch to Kratom. 
Yeah right, I just think DP didn't do their research so they assumed America's favorite Uncle Tom was right about everything. 
Incontrovertible is the most artistic and legitimately emotional of these, and it has quite a few moments with good information.
hehe, thanks
An alien spacecraft, carrying extra-terrestrials. 
Most of the imitations out there like the NBOME and the DOx chemicals taste very bitter. LSD is tasteless. 
They're like twizzlers that melted and re-solidified and you try convincing yourself they're the same.
Only torn apart in the minds of those desperate to think it's torn apart. \n\nLet me give it a shot: A think you can prove two head shots with the official records, and without anything being altered or faked (by default, 2 headshots means a conspiracy). The autopsy report for JFK (verified and consistently maintained by the autopsy surgeons and several autopsy witnesses), says that there was an entry wound on the back of the head 2 centimeters to the right and slightly above the [external occipital protuberance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_occipital_protuberance). The official records say there was an entry there in the scalp, skull, however the right cerebellum behind it exhibits only a small amount of damage. If a bullet entered that location and deflected enough to make that huge huge in the top-right side of the head, the right cerebellum would be totally torn to pieces. The X-rays and the brain photographs don't show any significant damage to the back of the brain besides some slight damage to the right cerebellum. This can only be explained by two bullets entering the head, one of them entering at the autopsy report's location, only grazing the right cerebellum, and hitting the floor of the skull. What could have happened to the bullet after that is a different story.\n\nThe government realized this problem by the late 60's, so they hired a panel of experts who came up with the radical and unsubstantiated theory that the real entry wound was actually 4 inches higher than previously recorded, high above the ears on the top of the head. The autopsy surgeons repeatedly denied this revision, and no autopsy witness has ever placed the entry wound high above the level of the ears. What the select members Clark Panel and the HSCA call a probably entry wound on the top of the skull is most likely a fracture related to the large head wound. 
From what I understand, people who don't accept the official story of 9/11 tend to accept that Bush couldn't even tie his own shoelaces. 
What do you want? You read it.
I wouldn't be surprised. I heard about a creature found in a cave that was half-bat, half-human child. It was on the news and everything. 
Absolutely not. This kind of sensationalism is one of the reasons why mainstream sources refuse to cover anything mainstream. The demolition theory can gain better traction when more stuff gets published and reviewed. \n\nDr. Leroy Hulsey, of the WTC 7 evaluation project, has already stated that he does not believe fire caused WTC 7 to collapse. But this can only gain traction when it gets finished and reviewed by an independant group of engineers, like Hulsey has stated he intends to do.
Sure it was. Sure it was. I happen to see it differently. I can only hope that all four members of DP were too incompetent to spot this, otherwise they're deliberately distorting the issues because they're all secretly falling prey to the alt-right cancer. 
Nope. 
Please go back and watch the original Joe Rogan clip. 
DP literally didn't take the ONE MINUTE the watch the whole Joe Rogan clip where Milo casually mentions being at these Hollywood sex parties with "very, very young" kids. Jesus, is this what they call "addressing the controversy"? Now a large portion of their audience have a completely incorrect idea of the true issues surrounding Milo and pedophilia. 
Is there any chance some hypnosis is involved here? This sounds like the kind of thing an expert could convince someone to do under hypnosis if you really worked on it. Like a female Sirhan. 
No, not really. Dr. Bernard L. Diamond did work examining Sirhan Sirhan, and he was so susceptible to hypnosis that he could make Sirhan behave like a monkey in his prison cell, climbing on shit and throwing things. 
Why is this shit so funny
Jesus Christ, opened this up to maybe see something reasonable, and I got Pizzagate. Speculate about high-level people all you want but for dear God an actual Pizza place has nothing to do with it. 
Look up quotes by Churchill, he didn't give a shit about Indians because they "bred like rabbits". 
That's a pretty common theory among JFK researchers. Acceptance of the official story is negatively correlated with how much you read into it. 
Just googled this. You've got to be kidding me. Citizen Kane being his favorite movie was the one glimmer of hope that he has some intelligence.
The back shot was in the upper back, not the "neck". The [autopsy photo](http://www.jfkmurdersolved.com/images/BE5_HI.jpg) shows it at about the level of the first thoracic vertebrae. If you question the authenticity of the photos, you'd probably consider the back wound as being lower, at about the level of the third thoracic vertebrae. 
If you've never done NBOME, it's like an explosion of bitter chemical taste in your mouth and it can make your mouth numb.
Will it have weird-colored food?
Sure, closed to murderers. 
What is a spillway?
> it probably extended his career by a few years.\n \nMore than 3 years? \n
I mean, no offense to you, but what kind of country do we live in when people could actually believe that rather than believe there are other gunmen at large? Fancy computer cartoons like that are designed to convince the average viewer while not actually proving anything scientific. It's the Television equivalent of Nestle hiring people in white overcoats to convince poor villages that baby formula is better than breastfeeding. I don't think there are even any photographs of that Secret Service agent's position at the time of the shooting. \n\nThe expert who proposed that theory believes that the entry wound on the back of the head was 4 inches higher than the autopsy report, the testimonies of the 3 autopsy surgeons, and autopsy witnesses place it. The entry wound was low in the head, behind the ear, and from the official films and x-ray I think it's easy to gather than it had no relation to the large wound on the top-right side of the head. 
what audio?
The average American doesn't know that Kennedy's personal physician, Dr. George Burkley, often expressed that he suspected or believed in multiple shooters, and even suggested two head shots himself. Burkley witnessed the autopsy and verified the face sheet, signing his name on the lower-left corner.\n\n1967 oral history interview:\n\n>*McHUGH: "I see. Do your conclusions differ at all with the Warren report of the circumstances or cause of death?"*\n\n>*BURKLEY: "My conclusion in regard to the cause of death was the bullet wound which involved the skull. The discussion as to whether a previous bullet also enters into it, but as far as the cause of death the immediate cause was unquestionably the bullet which shattered the brain and the calvariurm."*\n\n>*McHUGH: "I see. The brain and the what?"*\n\n>*BURKLEY: "And the skull, calvarium."*\n\n>*MCHUGH: "I see. Do you agree with the Warren Report on the number of bullets that entered the President's body?"*\n\n>*BURKLEY: "I would not care to be quoted on that."*\n\nhttp://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/burkley.htm\n\n1977 HSCA interview report:\n\n>...*The doctors didn't section the brain and if it had been done, it might be able to prove whether or not there were two bullets. Dr. Burkley thinks there was one but concedes of the possibility of there having been two.*\n\nhttps://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=600&relPageId=5&search=%22concedes_of%20the%20possibility%20of%20there%20having%20been%20two%22\n\nBurkley's affidavit to the HSCA:\n\n>*Had the Warren Commission deemed to call me, I would have stated why I retained the brain and the possibility of two bullets having wounded President John F. Kennedy's brain would have been eliminated.*\n\nhttp://www.kenrahn.com/Marsh/Autopsy/BURKLEY.TXT\n\nHere is an official memo from HSCA staffer Richard Sprauge:\n\n\n>From: Richard Sprague\n>To: File\n>March 18, 1977\n\n>William F. Illig, an attorney from Erie, Pa., contacted me in Philadelphia this date, advising me that he represents Dr. George G. Burkley, Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy retired, who had been the personal physician for presidents Kennedy and Johnson.\n\n>Mr. Illig stated that he had a luncheon meeting with his client, Dr. Burkley, this date to take up some tax matters. **Dr. Burkley advised him that although he, Burkley, had signed the death certificate of President Kennedy in Dallas, he had never been interviewed and that he has information in the Kennedy assassination indicating that others besides Oswald must have participated.**\n\n>Illig advised me that his client is a very quiet, unassuming person, not wanting any publicity whatsoever, but he, Illig, was calling me with his client’s consent and that his client would talk to me in Washington.\n\nhttps://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/numbered_files/box_23/180-10086-10295/html/180-10086-10295_0002a.htm\n\n\nAuthor Henry Hurt alleged in his book *Reasonable Doubt* that he scored an interview with Burkley:\n\n>*It is significant that Dr. Burkley had been with the President in Dallas, with him in the Parkland Hospital emergency room, with his body as it was flown east, and present during the autopsy. It is also significant that even though he was the only doctor present both at Parkland and at Bethesda, Dr. Burkley's testimony was never taken by the Warren Commission, nor was it taken later by the House Select Committee.*\n\n>**In 1982 Dr. Burkley told the author in a telephone conversation that he believed that President Kennedy's assassination was the result of a conspiracy.**\n\n>*This startling statement, after so long a silence, amplified an obscure exchange Dr. Burkley had in an oral-history interview on file at the Kennedy Library in Boston.*\n\nAnd also wrote in an endnote:\n\n>*When he originally telephoned the author, Dr. Burkley expressed his willingness to discuss various matters concerning the assassination. He asked for a letter detailing the areas the author wished to discuss. Dr. Burkley acknowledged receipt of the letter with a letter of his own. Two months later, the author proposed a meeting with Dr. Burkley to discuss the points. The doctor responded with an abrupt refusal to discuss any aspect of the case.*\n\nhttp://krusch.com/books/kennedy/Reasonable_Doubt.pdf\n\nIn Michael L.

The LHO story is like flat earth to me. The locations of the wounds to the scalp/skull in relation to the damage to the brain is impossible with only one head shot. It had to be two headshots, and that's with none of the evidence being faked or altered. And I don't believe in the later revisions placing the entry wound way above the ears where no other autopsy professional or autopsy record placed it. That's my favorate smoking gun, but then you have other stuff like the back wound being shallow and angled downward 45-60 degrees. It just doesn't work with one shooter. It's baloney. LHO probably wasn't even on the sixth floor at the time.   
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm gay, young, and I have a husband the same age as me. 
Check out Rob Ager's videos about it on Youtube. It just comes across as western propaganda with the germans as sub-human. Only the Americans are shown as complex creatures with a sensetive side. 
They should have the part with the guy who owns a bar that gradually becomes the town's gay bar unbeknownst to him. You just know it's Pennywise fucking with the whole town in subtle ways. 
I'm pretty sure he was just being a cheeto-breathed twat.
Yeah, why? He's like the gay version of Tommy Sotomayor. It's like sometimes DP is all closeted all-rightists. Milo is a homophobic Uncle Tom climate change denialist who insists being gay is a choice and being transgender is a delusion. He believes in Pizzagate and is generally subtracting from the sub total of humanity's knowledge. Isn't he a creationist too?  
DP acts like they're the ones that have the inside scoop on this Milo thing when they are actually ignoring 60% of the issue.\n\nOn Joe Rogan, Milo claimed that he attended Hollywood sex parties which featured kids he called "very, very young", and that he refuses to name the high-level people present. It could be bullshit, but that's a pretty serious thing to just casually mention. That's the kind of thing I would realistically expect an FBI visit from. This isn't just an issue of what may or may not have happened to Milo himself. Did they just fall asleep during that part?\n
There are credible sources arguing for and against it. I know the famine was man-made because their surplus crops were forced to be sold instead of stowed away in case of drought. I know Churchill was racist and didn't care and claimed in public that he didn't care because "Indians breed like rabbits". 
This lady kicked ass at the 9/11 Commission hearings and she was awesome when she explained the MLK assassination in the film *Incontrovertible*, but please do not tell me she believes in Pizzagate. 
The Newman couple? They're the ones in well-known photographs shielding their two young children on the grassy knoll. 
Do you really think that we don't understand that office fire temperatures can weaken steel?\n\nBy the way, the official story for WTC 7's collapse is not typical high-heat weakening of the steel, but thermal expansion of the steel. Thermal expansion is the same phenomenon that causes the Eiffel Tower to grow and shrink about 7 inches between summer and winter times. WTC 7 had functional fireproofing coating on the steel, which may very well not be the case with the Twin Towers which was heavily jolted by the airplane crashes. In other words, it doesn't matter how long the fires burned, a very specific and rare phenomenon is the only plausible thing which could have done anything to the structure. NIST actually removed some structural elements from their model to make it collapse easier (this is just the fraud we know for a fact-- NIST will not release their calculations and computer data because they say a terrorist could use it to destroy other buildings). 
This project is not complete yet. It will be complete when Hulsey announces that it is complete and it goes through a review process, as Hulsey intends. Hulsey is technically just offering his opinion at this point.
>Later on, before he poured part of a slab concrete base for the house, I was put in charge of clearing out vermin underneath the house. I was 18.\n\nYou were just... boys. 
He was in the restraunt on the top floor of the North Tower because the leaseholder's PR agent, Howard Rubenstein, canceled a breakfast meeting at the last moment. The leaseholder Larry Silverstein also did not go to his office on the top of the North Tower because he says he had a dermatologist appointment. 
I actually posted that comment after reading the Wikipedia article. I guess what I meant is, what does a spillway look like? I'm watching the KCRA live broadcast now, not sure exactly what a spillway looks like so I can imagine the potential disaster. 
Is there any evidence or even a strong rumor that Trump has dyslexia? \n\n> So for example, science, Albert Einstein is a great example.

There's /r/actualconspiracies, but they even delete posts about JFK. They're no fun. 
Thank you.
Any lifetime now because Pizzagate is BS.
Why not?
This can't happen because it makes too much sense and would be too entertaining. 
Don't tell this to a lot of people but I had to get the fucking used recorder in elementary because my parents couldn't buy one. Everyone had a nice cream colored recorder in a green case and I had that shitty used black recorder with no case that was pre-sucked on. Sorry but talking about recorders makes me a little emotional. 
Thought that too but schevckedddozxzzzdodo looked bigger during the face-off
Or a fight companion where they just say what ever the fuck they want. 
You've got this backwards. Taking repeated brain damage throughout a 10 or 12 round fight is the opposite of mercy.\n\n
I suspect you have a neck tat but could be wrong. Are you a pro or have you just watched a lot of youtube videos about pros and their sparring preferences with less skilled fighters? Sparring is definitely teaching, BTW.
I was disagreeing with you. 
Wearing gi pants to Home Depot is cool though. 
It would be embarrassing to be the 3rd guy, but then again that guys higher up on the card. 
I bet you're right. Whats your point? 
Lt Jim Dangle is also from Reno
Don't believe it was under a threat of assassination but he clearly changed his tone and I could see a deal being cut behind the scenes. FBI saves face, in return they agree to assist in Trump's battle with the media. 
You just made the CIA watchlist. 
Happened to me after an injury while I was taking a poo. Woke up wondering why I was laying on the bathroom floor with my pants down. 
You should see the other guy...
They were like 3 bucks at the time. 2 years in a row we couldn't make it happen. 
Thats agent St. Pierre from the Matrix.
CM Punk vs Bob Sapp. Make it happen Rizin. 
How is it not?
Just not seeing it. Looks like a lot of kettle bells and creatine to me. /s
Went there for spring break, definitely not a myth. Mexico is a small town in Arizona. 
With your eyes. 
Not that elusive. I nail it 5/7 times. 
Hate it when shirtless fights break out on the skating rink. 
Gay Jesus is a fake ass fake humility bitch with 12 twitter followers. 
It will be a great fight but I'm most impressed with Cody. He went from a boxer/slugger in previous fights to a pure tactician against Cruz. 
His long awaited documentary was a complete let down as well. Short on facts, heavy on unproven bullshit. seemed like a giant tribute to himself. This is coming from a huge former fan of his who's still intrigued by the holofractal theory. 
Give's me chills. Popped my shoulder out a few times, it will never be the same. 
This is McGregor's fault. 
Could you image if it was a left hook? 
It's really not like that though because you're not in a relationship with professional athletes and they don't owe specifically you authentic tweets. Fuck man, do you expect them to run their own websites as well? 
Build a bridge and get over it
Wall just got 10 feet higher. 
> Exactly. Look at Jessica Penne.\n\nCall me crazy but she was more attractive before the surgery. 
Had that same feeling. Maybe a work, maybe he was injured/out of shape and took the easy way out. I expect downvotes, but I had a similar feeling in Silva/Sonnen 1. The finish seemed a little too magical for me and conveniently set up a huge rematch. 
But does Eastern European heritage really provide that much of an advantage in a fight?
If it's your turn to spar and its against a pro do you say no and just go into the bathroom and masturbate instead? Most of the sparring sessions I've had are controlled by a coach and there's at least a loose understanding on how hard you'll be going. Maybe the gym should have a different sparring/training format that doesnt pair up noobs and pros? 
Fuck yeah, I'm sure a couple random dudes on the internet have come up with a much more thorough business valuation than the idiots in charge of a $40 million dollar sale. 
Nah, it's probably just the angle. Plus GSP is huge. 
Me either. 
Would anyone be against calling them "#1 contender fights"? Make it five rounder and respect the results. You could throw them out more often without watering down the title. 
Haven't sampled the whole world like you obviously have, but I'm a huge Cyborg fan. She brings it every fight and looks for the finish. Who else is comparable in WMMA?
Have to agree but then Conor came along and fucked it up for everyone. 
Fuck Gary, Indiana. Want to be friends?
This should be all the validation you need to keep digging. There's something to pizzagate. 
Somebody said it in another thread but I love Penn VS Gomi. Send him out in style and let him have a war. 
Not a big thing. It was dark and they were tired so forgot to put the shorts on top. Cut them some slack. \n\nOr at least that's what I say to myself when I see these "males" to stay civil. 
Just the angle. Plus GSP is huge. 
Some real insider info there. Send Dee nudes. 
Very interesting indeed. When did this happen in the timeline of events and what happened next?
Had a dumb friend who thought she was a model. On her modeling card under hair she wrote "yes" and under eyes she wrote "2". She was completely serious. 
Not even cropped
Don't have the link but I'm sure somebody will provide it. Prepare to have your mind blown. 
Gotta love all the generic rock music on UFC FightPass. On the bright side, boring bands now have something to shoot for. 
I also heard cejudo went to the Olympic training center for wrestling or something. Can somebody confirm?
Where'd you get your cert? Was going to get this or my PMP. Leaning towards this. 
Please somebody respond and turn this into one of those inception rabbit hole thingys. 
Don't know the fight but clearly remember him saying this. Good times...
It's not the jungle. It's possible to have a light sparring session where you work on technique and not try to kill each other. 
Have you tried draining the flea power? 
Not even into this topic but I read the whole article. What a completely fucked up situation. 
That was beautiful. 
> Takanori Gomi\n\nThis would have been competitive and awesome. There's still time for 1 more, let him go out after a war. 
He was on his way out after, definitely not before. 
How dare me
I have to think this would help with any elections. 
He's had a lot of issues since USADA. Anyone else happen to notice? 
> Miesha is fine\n\nagreed
That first comment is funny: "Shame about the grappling"
> I'm willing to bet this is all highly dependent on accent, elocution, and ambient noise though.\n\nMaybe she just thinks you sound snarky and has to take a deep breath before she can process what you're saying. 
Must be a big ass basement to hold 10 tons of tomatoes. Can I get a tomato farmer to explain how big that room needs to be? Please us a banana for scale. 
What is your theory

"yuck!"
Running. 
Well did he live or what?
Was on the fence but interim title would look pretty sweet hanging in the garage next to my home depot shelving and kid's bikes. Sign me up. 
Does anyone remember that old clip where he had bleached blonde hair and forgot to be Hawaiian?
> Looking at you Graham Hancock.\n\nHow dare you.
Maybe she just wanted one shoe. 
At least he has rap to fall back on. He's made smart business moves and doesn't need to fight anymore. 
Did you read the article? The part stating why she's in custody is literally one paragraph. The rest is an account of her corruption and is questioning why top democrats would cozy up to her. Here's a list from the article: http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2016-07-08/story/corrine-brown-decades-drama\n\n
Me too. Feels good to reach the top. 
I'm 5'11 but put 6'2 on my drivers license. 
And more entrenched than some simple firings. 
My brain shuts off when I hear people parrot "narrative" or "the right/the left". You don't have to buy into the manufactured republican/democrat bullshit. There's a whole world outside of that "narrative".
Good to hear. Was worried about this until I came across this thorough analysis from a couple of Reddit civil engineers. Please share your scientific findings with the news outlets so everyone can stop panicking. 
You're fucking deliver leaves much to be desired, plus you're on steroids. 
I agree and I would expect him to rise to the occasion with TJ as well. 
Thoroughly let down by his documentary. Wanted to believe, and still may, but he doesn't seem to have answers. 
> Hilary hasn't had anyone killed to expedite her career.\n\nlol
Saw this same thing happen in 7th grade
It's because he didn't have an EIN. He wasn't selling it, he was slanging it. 
You now need to have $8.31 on it to compensate for inflation rates since 1995 (song release)
Milo is claiming the relationship between 13 year old boys and adults is somewhat normal. It's sick and perverted. \n\nIn these vids, I saw George describing his past and not fully understanding he was a victim.  He isn't calling it normal, but I agree he's making light of it. 
So George was a victim who's siding with his captor/predator... isn't this common for victims? Should he lose sponsorships because he was a victim? \n\nI agree that someone should ask him if he realizes he's a victim and perhaps have him reflect on the consequences of these events.\n\nThe only thing that I see wrong, he should have reported the guy (even 50 years later) to prevent abuse to others...
I agree it's ironic that the left now is saying that the content of the leak is more important than the fact that leak itself happened. \n\nIt's equally ironic that Trump's stance on leaking has changed 180 degrees. From encouraging Russia to continue hacking Hillary "if they are listening", to claiming these leaks are illegal. \n\nBoth parties are quite hypocritical, but I'm pretty sure it's human nature. 
Disagree\n\nMilo lives (and has always lived, AFAIK) in the USA, where pedophilia is defined using an age of consent of 17-18. \n\n13 (an age he used, not me) is a whole different realm. Would you feel the same if he was advocating adult men having sex with 13 year old girls?
It would be a shame? LoL.\n\nWhys that phrase so popular on this sub now.... it feels like I've seen it somewhere else...
I agree that his optimism leads to him saying "I'll just sit back and watch what happens" a bit too often.\n\nHis presentation style of current events framed by historical context is pretty unique and gives good perspective. 
Milo's statements were exactly that: pedo apologies\n\nAnything he says after that video is nothing more than back tracking for PR. \n\nMilo straight up said that 13 year old boys are sexually mature & ready to have relations with adult men.\n\nHis press conference was him playing the victim card (which I don't blame, but there's a clear difference to me between milo and george's comments) but he never really addressed his comments about the gay community having different pedo rules.
I've found Dan Carlin to be fairly un-biased. I liked his analysis of current events.\n\nWhat your opinions of Dan? His history podcasts have been quite entertaining as well.
It's a bot. It's posted like 20 times in last few minutes and posts to multiple subs simultaneously. 
So the question is, if Trump is really a Russian puppet, why would they marginalize his power by admitting this (I saw this first on RT, Russian propaganda)\n\nSeems to me that Russia is looking to destabilize the USA & using our 2-party system to facilitate the chaos. \n\nThis interview with an ex-KGB agent in the 80s has some good insight \nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA

I've been saying that hypothetical for a while. Jimmy and Gronk to Browns for #1 overall. Would you do it?
You are both right. The assistant saw a rape happen in a shower and reported it to Paterno. Paterno reported it the the AD. The AD did nothing and Paterno didn't do anything after that. 
This article also called Bannon a white nationalist. How is this thing getting upvoted?
I loved Kurt as a QB but the biggest knock on him is he only played well in stadiums.

I've been wondering why we haven't heard more about the transition tag for him. 
Thanks
Maybe they were talking about Lady Liberty.
This is a Celtics legend and HoF player playing his last game in his true home court and he is wearing Pats gear. This fired me up even more. 
Did he have a bad year? I thought he was good in 2015
You would be perfect for the new character Dr. Agon.
Easy bet. Pick Matt Ryan at home and never pick Rodgers on the road against a good team. 
Yes that she cosponsored. Many of those have dozens of co sponsors. 
At this point he would only be a good fit with the Patriots. Doesn't have much at all left in the tank but always comes up big in the playoffs. Keep him on ice until week 14. 
They are building up for Roman to retire Taker at Mania.
I don't think people will get nba style contracts but there are 3 teams with over $100m. People are going to get big time deals. Mark it right here.
He was an incredibly productive college QB even though he played against lesser competition he dominated. His senior year he threw for 5000 yards, 53 TDs and only 9 ints.\n\nScouts and coaches raved about him pre draft and if he went to a better school would have been a 1st round pick.\n\n\nHe has looked very good in pre season games and looked great in regular season games.\n\nHe was very impressive in the opening game against AZ.\n\nA team should want him because he has the physical tools and should already be developed. Coaches would not need to develop him like they would a rookie. He sat behind Brady and watched how he prepared and practiced. \n\nHe is a safer QB than any incoming rookie and has a higher ceiling 
I think the Pats are better of with Leveon in than D'Angelo. D'Angelo always has good games against them. 
It is probably the worst time for Cinema but the golden age of Television.
No it is not. Both caps are going up and with the CBA ending in 2020 teams will be spending more within this year and next to starve out players closer to the CBA expiring. 
Tom Brady on Trump "He just doesn't lose" coming from one of the greatest winners in history. 
One of the best documentary series there is. I think there will never be a better OJ documentary made. 
White supremacist? When you make a claim like that you better have good proof or your just an asshole. 
So?

Both teams should just stop trying to run
I understand castles use but people always melee castle's to get around having to have a breaching tool. It kind of takes away the idea of the barricade if people can one hit it. 
How do you start a private game? All I see under multiplayer is join.
Larry Centers was such an underrated player. Has more cathces as a FB/H back than some HoF WRs
Does Matt Ryan not have the ability to audible into a running play?
Because trying to recreate something that was so hot never works out no matter how cool it was. 
McCarthy is a great play caller. Everything else he is mediocre or below. 
He is a weasel but he gets Revis stuff right. Mehta said in the morning that Revis would be a Patriot by the end of the night. This is when he was still a Buc. He got cut and then signed that night. 
Do people realize President Obama bombed this country and many others for years? Hundreds of thousands died. But no one cares. He actually won a Nobel Peace Prize. The cognitive dissonance in the world especially the internet is disheartening.
I think J James just got the wind knocked out of him.
Thanks
Greatest Jerry Rice\n\nMost Talented is Randy Moss
I'm not sure. I have a feeling contracts are going to get crazy like the NBA offseason last year. Also new 4 year window for the 89% cash floor.
That's not a penalty. He put his hands up to defend the ball. Face guarding is not a thing.

Wow. I never liked them but that was awesome. 
This is why Joe Banner is no longer a GM.

RIP Baxter
Comparing the Yemen raid to Benghazi shows how uninformed people are about both events. 
It does happen sometimes. Just look at his record. Better off not picking him. 
Doesn't bother me. Steelers are a great team with a 2x champ at QB. 
Get ready for Julio to be doubled and to have a light box and try to force the Falcons to run the ball. 
They have one this game
Some team is going to pay Logan Ryan a shit town of money this offseason. 
Ray Gricar was a District Attorney that lead an investigation into Jerry Sandusky in 1998 for sexual abuse. He shut down the case. A few years later he disappeared forever. His laptop was found in the bottom of a lake with his hard drive destroyed. Ray has never been found. His brother Roy died under mysterious circumstances in 1996.
It still sucks but in order for it to work you need to fire another shot and detonate those. 
They probably bought he cheapest flag.
No. Running out of bounds and then being the first to touch the football = illegal touching.
First time seeing "President Trump" written for real. Fucking kek
2003 there was Co MVPs the late great Steve McNair and Peyton Manning. Brady beat them both in the playoffs back to back. 
Have you tried Capitalism Lab?\n\nI love it\n\nIts a remake of Cap II with added features and the developer keeps coming out with DLC for it like running for mayor.
So reddit loves the Koch brothers now? What a time to be alive. 
I have an even better excuse for you. They Falcons are just better.
What?
I meant to say around and not over. 
What was the fuck up?

"No access"\n\nthat sucks  I plat Siege non stop and play all of their betas and releases.
The RB direct snap is a staple 2pt play for the Pats.
I love Logan and thank him for what he did for our team but he is going to get big time paid. Congrats to him and best of luck. 
D'Angelo always tears up the Pats. 
Don't be like that
When Chip was at Oregon him and BB became good friends. BB would bring Chip in to help with offensive up tempo philosophies. It would be interesting to see what position he would get. Maybe he would become Assistant Head Coach.
That was Thuney
No. The exact opposite was said for years until they won again in 2014. 
Looking for XB1 key please
That was terrible play calling. Spread them out again.
I agree. I never defended Paterno and his actions. Neither did u/Scubetrolis . We both just pointed out what happened. 
Because he's not even the greatest QB to play for the 49ers. 
How much money did Matt Damon get offered for that shitter? Don't usually see him cash in like that.
What?
He really is a dirty player
No way they would stick Cena in a mixed tag at Mania. That would be a tremendous waste. 
David Duke endorsed Ellison....
To be fair I think Flynn got heat because he was a civilian while he was  talking to Russia and it is illegal for a civilian to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the US. I love Flynn and he is a true Patriot but if he broke the law then he needs to go. I just hate how the media all of the sudden cares about this kind of shit. 
I love Lynch but what? 
You have Braun Strowman as high? I haven't been following as closely the past 2 months. Has he been getting a push?
CNN actually doing good job covering this. Have to give people credit when they deserve it. 
Last time I remember that was agaisnt Steelers in 07 
No one likes Shank in New England. He is a troll. He thinks the Pats constantly play terrible teams that's why they win. He never gives them credit for being good everyone else is just bad. He is setting it up so either he was right the Pats were not as good as everyone said or they beat a bad team. 
Is Johnny Manziel at the game? VICE tweeted a pic of him in a Pats hat and shirt looks like at the game
No
There was not enough evidence to overturn. 
Sanu "We about to put 40 something on they ass"\n\nGabriel "We got to."\n\n\nGood thing they didn't have Gabriel calling the plays. Seems to be the only one that got it. 
Maybe it could work in certain situations on certain castles but for the most part do you encounter people trying to melee down the castle?
Have him call the offense next game to see if he can do it.
Because Snopes has been caught lying and altering facts before.That's why.
This ties in to the Worldcorp video of a "man"(read: disgusting low life piece of shit)beating and scaring a child while saying his name is John and telling the child the say his other name(in a thick Chicago accent,where Podesta is from).The child says "Skippy".\n\nBut I'll bet that's just a coincidence,huh? /s\n\nYou fucking Shills say there is nothing to investigate but cases have been investigated over a lot less than that.\n\nSource:Parent was a police officer.
Fuck off.Yeah,no one could possibly be genuinely concerned for abused children and/or want to change to "Brownstone bribery" system in govt.\n\nYou Shills are working for David Brock who is a part of that system and in the shill playbook,accusing the people who are accusing the people involved.So take your bullshit somewhere else.\n\nShills can fuck off and die.
Love it!Repost this every day and weed those fucking bastards out of here permanently!
If this is true about the shutdown of these sites,that is amazing.Kudos to the hackers.
Thank you everybody.I guess I'm going to have to wait until then.I saw on another post that freeseries.to has it but I'm too scared to get some kind of virus on my phone(my only internet right now)or something else foul because I went on said site.
Wrong.Trump denounced Epstein a long time ago.
I'm hoping that the plan is that smaller fish will turn on the bigger fish.\n\n*COUGH* PODESTA *COUGH*
Gonna take it to the gun range,shithead.
Reposting the CNN report of the 5,000 people in govt. with CP on their computers everyday would be helpful,too.Even a shill can't deny that.\n\nFUCK YOU SHILLS!!!

What bullshit.Havent you ever known someone who you thought was cool and found out something fucked up about them later?
Twas' the previous president and the media  that started the "fake news" bs.Not Trump and his current administration.
Forget the damn butterfly and realize that the Clinton connections and Haiti connection would be the key factor!
Woody Allen\n\nGood source.  Lol
If you don't know about people's bullshit behind closed doors but later find out and then denounce them when you do?Fine.Which is exactly what I think the case with Trump and Epstein is.
Your momma.That's who.
Great post.I totally agree.Reading this stuff makes me feel like the world is filled with scum and villany(and it is).I counteract this stuff reading r/ Eyebleach,r/aww and the like.
You're free to go fuck yourself.
There was nothing there.
It's worldwide and interconnected.
The FBI catalogued it in 2007.It existed years before that.
Wrong.The news about the "grab them by the pussy" thing came out before the election.What the fuck are talking about?
Of course It would.Immediately.
Yes,I agree he is not advocating for pedophilia but for an older man/woman taking advantage f a horny,confused young teen,is wrong.Even if the kid is fully willing and into it.On the Joe Rogan show (which is posted in this sub),he states that it's OK for an older man to "mentor" a 14-15 year old because it helps them feel OK about being gay.Im all for trying to help a gay kid feel better about their place in the world but doing so by having sex with them?I call bullshit.Let those kids experiment with sex with kids their own age.I understand that he is trying to say that it's OK if they are willing,but he is still wrong.Can't the older person in that scenario verbally help them without fucking them? Can't said older person fuck someone who is at least of legal age(which is 16 in the U.K.....Still too young in my opinion)?\n\nI just disagree with Milo.
Didn't know they were ex-members.That gives me some hope.
You're definitely not alone.I worked a job for years where I traveled the country and talked politics with the public just about every day.And "rabbit hole' conversations would come up frequently.And more and more each year.And probably more than I know because I was mostly concentrating on my job.Many people are woke(or,at least,half woke).
Actually,it's an easy connection.\n\nPolice chief shown to ignore and threaten obvious rape victim.\nBusiness owner with close political ties with the top politicians in the nation.\nPolice chief ignores any and all rape claims or allegations about this business owner.\n\nToo difficult for you to connect that?\n\nGo play outside for a while.Don't forget your helmet!
Absolutely.Everyone should do this at least once a day.
Why was removed in the first place?That's the real question.Why the fuck is Reddit removing then readding comments after being called out on it?\n\nShady shit going on.Aaron Swartz would be disgusted with how Reddit is these days.
What an absolute piece of shit.
Because the spillway is falling apart and when/if it does,the dam could/will give way.
This is just like the Trump pics with Epstein.Once Trump realized what Epstein was about,he disavowed him.\n\nAnyone who once supported Milo,now that we know what he's really about,are disavowing him.\n\nAnd if you don't....Welp,that's highly questionable.What Milo is saying is probably true,that young boys are "mentored" by older men,it still doesn't make it right.
That's what I was thinking.Get rid of him.Send him to some cozy island retreat while saying he's in jail.
Supermassive Black Bear
Off topic but am I the only one who thinks she is really hot?
Out of context bullshit.\n\nShills can fuck off.
The dam is going to break and kill thousands.Why the fuck did they bring the people back?!?
Bullshit.Any and all pedos.Dennis Hastert is a Republican.And from I've read,no pgator cares about party.\n\nShills suck the sweat off a dead man's balls.
Yes,Trump is orange and Hillary is a treasonous,"secret and favors for sale" piece of shit.\n\nRead the WikiLeaks.The FBI confirmed they were real and Hillary is did these things while in office.And some of you guys want her in office still?Next time you read an article,read more than the headline.
No.We are talking about the hypocrisy of a Nobel Peace Prize winner dropping more bombs than any other President.
I think it's a real pic but that Trump didn't know what this guy was really about.
Most people on this sub have disavowed Milo.What the fuck are you guys talking about?This sounds like a straw man argument.\n\nYes,some including myself,were for Milo  UNTIL he started stating his views about it being o.k. for 13&14 year olds to be "mentored" by older men.And then,rightly so,he was disavowed by people.\n\nAnd,I just want to restate that 98% of people on here do not give a shit about what party you're in if you're a pedo.Lock them ALL up.Dennis Hastert is a Republican.And the Podesta brothers are still good friends with him.Who the fuck stays friends with someone after they are exposed as a pedo???\n\nOther pedos.That's who.
Jesus H. Christ!!I couldn't watch more than five seconds of that.That was the worst shit I've ever seen.WTF is wrong with some people?!?!?
What?That is contradictory bullshit.Its bad even if they want to be groped?Why?
I understand that gays kids want to feel normal but does the older guy have to fuck him to do so?No.This pretense of "I'm helping you" is bullshit.Couldnt the older man verbally help the kid out?Encourage him to experiment with a kid his age who is more secure about his gay sexuality?
Keeping in mind that he also said he is not for prepubescent sex with kids and that pedophilia is different than a horny,confused young teen wanting to try sex but...And I want to clearly state this,I strongly disagree with Milo and denounce what he is saying.Kids that age are too young,stupid,don't know enough about life and sex to be messing with older men/women even if they are willing.Milo is deeply wrong about this.And the older men/women should locked up for fucking around with kids that she even if it is "consensual".\n\n
It was originated by the Podesta emails.
Who knows when you have the police dept. covering for you?And if these kids are from another country without records,there would be no trace or trail to follow.
I'm too scared to look into these.Whats in these files?
I really hope that you all are correct.I don't want any loss of life but every day I see it getting worse and worse with more erosion.They say it's getting fixed but how exactly are they fixing a spillway that is broken down more each day?\n\nOroville Dam is an earthen dam and CA has a massive storm on the way.It doesn't look good.Why not evacuate now until the storm is over just to be safe?That's all I'm saying because this could shape up to be a massive disaster with massive loss of life.\n\n
Don Lemon is a cunt.
What scares me the most about this whole ordeal is that THE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING EVACUATED!!!!\n\nI know they did it once and then said they could go home but it looks worse every day.This is a false flag setup.I pray in advance for Oroville.
I did watch the video.He clearly states that he isn't for young teen and prepubescent sex.He made a joke about himself getting head from a priest.He spoke about his relationship with an older man when he was 17.Which is legal in England.\n\nShills suck.
Tesla believed that the Earth is a plane and not a planet.If true,then the ocean would be infinite.So screw that guy who commented before you.
Because she sang after losing an election(after she lost campaign funding because she spoke out against the people behind the scenes)?!?\n\nShills suck.Go back and get your old job sucking cocks for nickels at the bus stop.
I did not hear 13 years old in the video but....Just saw a Joe Rogan interview where he was talking about himself as a sexually active 14 year old and defending that stance for others.So...I retract what I said above.\n\nI think what he is saying is that if someone that young is absolutely WILLING to be involved with someone older than that is OK,but,to me,that is still very,very wrong.No kid that age,should be making those decisions because they are still developing mentally and physically(even though technically people are still developing between 18-25).Especially straight people because what the fuck happens if they get pregnant?All bad for everyone involved. It's obviously a different situation for gay men and women in that instance but...I now denounce what Milo is saying.
Wrong.It came out during the debates which was before the election.\n\nMan...You guys just spew the first thing that comes in your head, don't you?
Preach it,Donald!
I worked a job where I traveled the country and spoke about politics with the public for years.More people are woke(or at least half woke)than you would expect.Not enough, unfortunately,but the numbers went up every year it seemed.
Lemons are yellow.\n\nJust like his company's style of "journalism".
I saw a video with Joe Rogan more explicitly stating that he is for willing 13 and 14 year olds to be involved with older people. So...I retract my above statement.I was wrong.
Are you guys really shitting on Ivanka's husband like that?Super classy.
Lol\n\nTurbogigajews.
It's been happening for literally centuries but is only recently being mass exposed.
Lol!!\n"Freebase some red pills..."\nI love real Redditors.Shills can suck the sweat off a dead man's balls.
Milo clearly states in the video that that he is not talking about prepubescent young boys and also clearly states that that pedophilia isn't like the relationships that he is talking about.My ex's brother is gay and got a lot of shit about being gay from his parents.He then went into the gay community and got a lot of positive support from older gay men(he was 17 or 18 when this occurred,just like Milo)and is a very well adjusted young man,now.Not a fearful,hiding from the world,scared young man.\n\nNowhere in this video does Milo advocate sex with 13 year olds.This is garbage because it says he is talking about sex with 13 year olds is OK.The poster is hoping that people will just read the headline and not watch the video.Fucking shame on you,OP.
Jesus.If that's true(which kind of makes sense considering all the other things in hamburger and sausage),I will never eat those things ever again.I feel sick.
This is out of context bullshit.He made a joke about getting better head from a priest.He clearly states in a video interview that he does not advocate sex with prepubescent kids and young teens.This is false bullshit.Look in this subreddit for  more detailed info.
There is proof of this going on.You can't deny it.And you're calling someone else stupid?You can't even read or comprehend this.\n\nHere.Here's a shiny red ball.Go play in the corner.
The FBI said that all the emails leaked were real.So stop your bullshit.
And she is still guilty of treason.Whats your point?
Well said.All they do is promote fear in the name of propaganda and ratings.
The interviewer said he had some questions to ask about the P-gate stuff and Polester kept talking until he could evade said questions.\n\nYup,not suspicious at all.  /s

Word.Dont love that he's got a bunch of Goldman Sachs people in his cabinet the Donald is doing some very good things(no....Not talking about the wall).
Of course the daughter of Zbigniew"Evil Prick" Brezinzski believes that.She and the rest of the MSM can eat a big bag of shit.
Both are absolute facts.He won a Nobel Peace Prize AND he dropped more than 26,000 bombs during his presidency.So,just to be clear,the are just plain fact facts.\n\nHope you enjoy it.
:)\n\nGreat post.You're an excellent example of humanity.
To all the Shills here:fuck off.
Wow.Yeah,Benghazi was fake bullshit to discredit Hillary five years before she ran the second time.Genius. /s\n\nBenghazi was about weapon trading with the bad guys and shit went sideways really badly or...The ambassador was killed because he knew info about it or was killed because he was going to leak info about it.\n\nFucking shills.Go to hell.

Lighter...."that's good stuff"...\n\nMost likely weed.
Why is that heartless bastard Elijah Wood leading that dolphin on?Fucking heartbreaker.
Wrong.The FBI confirmed the emails were real and....You can't fake  DKIM coding.
It's pronounced Polester.
That was a joke about Father Michael.Dont agree with Milo but that was just a joke.
A)Women are attracted to rich and powerful men.\nB)Yes.Some women do.\nC)It was literally 12 years ago when he said that.Long before any idea of him running for president was in his mind.\n\nShills and sensetive pussies can fuck off.
Wrong.The FBI has said the emails were real.Its on YouTube.
http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/146272\n\nThere you go.Proof Podesta calls himself Skippy.
Ain't it funny how there are no Shills on this post?Because they absolutely CANNOT deny this.It happened.It was reported.\n\nSo fuck you to every shill that denies that this happens in D.C.
Wrong.His body was damaged in the crash,he told the Vietnamese every thing he could and then got fixed up by the Viet Cong.No torture.\n\nPlus,he shouldn't have even been flying because he crashed two planes previously.But his Daddy and Grandpa were high ranking military men so McCain was allowed to wreck a third one.
Why is Cynthia McKinney supposedly disreputable?
One last thing,there are people in this thread who are saying that pedophilia and the gay community equal the same thing and that is just bullshit.Ive known many gay men and women and they would be disgusted with the idea of fucking young kids.Dont be simplistic,people.\n\nPedophilia is pedophilia and and does not equal all gay people.Yes,there is crossover but there are "straight" pedophiles,too(sick bastards).There are also pedo who like both.And,I want to emphatically state that this is not a partisan issue.There are Republicans AND Democrats that are guilty of this and they should all be thrown out of office and locked under the jail (except to be let out into gen. pop. where they get the living shit beaten out of them on a daily basis for the rest of their lives).
Then what the fuck does "raw and uncut" mean??
Don't give a shit how some brainwashed swine thinks I look.
One million percent.
Everyone here can see what you are trying so do your own research and stop using research-begging as an excuse to spread your lies and propaganda. 
Blaming Podesta for Hillary's loss now, sounds like they're getting ready to burn one of their own.\n
Who told her these things? Her research and evaluation of that research.
>I believe that Milo preyed upon young confused boys and provided them as sexual entertainment for the people at brietbart, and that his resignation has to do with that and not the false claim that the liberal media is unfairly attacking him. Last time I checked breitbart was not part of the liberal media. \n\nThat's slander and libel unless you can offer some evidence.  But you aren't here to offer evidence, are you?  No, you are here to spread disinfo.\n
You are mentally ill.  it means "OK".
Nope, you aren't gonna bait me into watching enemy propaganda, not for any reason.

>**I don't believe that 9-11 is a conspiracy**\n\nI don't think you know what the world conspiracy means, yet here you are posting on r/conspiracy... 
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to be condescending. It just seems like you are playing the game you are told to play and not looking at the bigger picture. \n\nYes, we both agree most people believe that powerful groups do control aspects of our society/government. What I can say for sure though, is that most people agree that the president and the election actually matter. At face value they do matter but once you get into the nitty gritty of it all, it's lie. More people are waking up to this fact, thank goodness!\n\nHere's where it seems we disagree:\nThat powerful cliques meet in secret to consolidate and expand their power to mold our minds, ideas and form our beliefs to enslave us. Most people do not agree that the daily news is there to manipulate your thoughts. What you see in mainstream news is not there to inform you, it's there to condition you. I'm sure you already know this but you falling for this Trump/Putin conspiracy like it actually matters... that's just mind boggling to me... especially with a person of your intellect and knowledge.
Why did it take a year for this to be revealed? Surely what Milo said wasn't kept secret for a year but why make a big deal out of it now?\n\nI'm not debating if Milo deserved it or not just that there is something going on behind the scenes here.
And the distractors come here in the many on high upvoted "Trump is Putins puppet" narrative. It's a nice distraction from realizing Trump is a puppet to the war industrialist and financiers. 
I feel like I'm going crazy when the two largest state sponsors of terrorism celebrate over a medal contributing to their counter-terrorism efforts.
Good point. You seemed so antsy to comment back towards me you didn't really read by post correctly so no problem, sorry for the misunderstanding :)\n\nI think it's more dangerous I haven't seen him criticize Israel and Netanyahu. The Palestinians are going to suffer even greater than before but no one seems to care about that. It's rather sad...\n\nYou are right, there is circumstantial evidence of a Putin-Trump relationship. Circumstantial evidence that has made me believe there is something there. The important question is how deep does it actually go and if the relationship does go deep, is it as dangerous as we are told it should be (I honestly don't think it is). Personally, if a conflict between Russia and USA can be avoided I'll be happy. 
>If anyone could please explain to me why painting iran as a target is necessary I would be happy to discuss.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe US should target Iran because the poor bankers/war industrialist can't make money from peace. You see we all have jobs to do and no matter what immoralities are conducted we must obey the rules given from above. For if we want to live in a world where US citizens benefit from the continuous suffering of others we must kill all those who do not allow our corporations to rein freely in said countries. We are the good guys. We bring freedom and Liberty to these countries by installing a corporatocracy (Central banks are corporations) and uninstalling their dictatorship that the USA might've helped create. We (the USA) are the good guys in every conflict and we save the populace from other countries' dictators by violence and greed. I get my news from the Washington Post, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, BBC, NYT, Huffington post, ABC, NBC, CBS and USA today. Because of these non-propagandist, non-omission media sources I know I'm informed and therefore we must Invade Iran/Syria/Russia/China if we want to secure our way of life. God bless America and support our Troops!\n\nSpez: I'm not being serious at all.. but i kinda am, for those who are... lets say... programmed.
Seeing as how continuously aggressive the US has become based on a false flag (9/11) I'm sure Russia realizes it has to step up its game to counter US/NATO expansion. Russia doesn't want war but it doesn't want to be pushed into a box like it has either.\n\nThe real conspiracy here is why can't the USA get along with Russia? Why is the USA threatening Russia forcing them to take action (Russia is going to do something as the US/NATO slowly close in on them)? The USA military industrial complex has thirst for blood money and/or Putin has pissed off the deep state here in the USA.\n\nIf the story is true and not just yellow journalism then it says a lot about Russia. A country with the GDP size of Spain can't even successfully overthrow the small, tiny little country of Montenegro. So much for Russia being a big ole' scary boogeyman NATO needs to confront.\n\nI love how the omission/propaganda media (the article you linked) totally glares over the fact the US had violently overthrown the Ukraine government in 2014.
Not sure what you mean..? For those who know what the deep state means(call it what you will, it has many different names but the deep state sounds like the best to get normes to accept it) it has got more publicity for the term which is good imo.
You are not alone my friend. And the things I do comment on I sometimes (usually) go back and edit them because I feel unsatisfied with the original.
Aye. Dropping off this gem by G. Edward Griffin.\n\n>"Now I've mention the world conspiracy before. I'll probably be using it again several times today and that causes some concern for a lot of people because it's kind of a knee jerk reaction for people to say, "Oh you believe in conspiracy? What are you a conspiracy theorist of some kind?". Well I'm certainly not a conspiracy theorist. When people take that position I have to laugh because I feel sorry for them. They obviously never have read a history book because anyone who knows anything about history knows that it's built on conspiracies from one end to the other. Conspiracy is the engine of history. Every major event in history when you examine it has come to past largely as a result of at least one and in many cases many conspiracies and it goes on today."

I know r/geopolitics doesn't allow conspiracies which is pretty funny since it's people in power who conspire to control dwindling resources of the world. \n\nI assume most subs are culturally conditioned to accept the lies they've been told so tread lightly or possibly get your comment removed.
Yup, global corporate facism.
I don't have much to add or say, but I enjoyed reading this. Thanks for sharing!
You forgot "a".
Russian separatists (not Russian soldiers) are fighting in eastern Ukraine (which is mostly filled with ethnic Russians) because they believe an illegitimate government is in control of their territory. \n\nNot one single Russian soldier has invaded Ukraine. Crimea has always been Russian and that was "annexed" (if you can call it that) peacefully and willingly by the local government and people of Crimea... which the majority of people living there are Russians.\n\nHope this information dispels your ignorance of the situation! Cheers!\n\nSpez: And if it doesn't correct your ignorance is sure as hell will make you defend the lies and half-truths you've been told!
>The president is a compromised russian agent - and half of you don't give a shit.\n\nPresidents are puppets to the bankers and financiers as you can see this through Trump's/Obama's/Bush's/Clinton's (etc.) cabinets. \n\nIf you think Putin is more powerful than the deep state then you are sadly uninformed and/or misinformed.
American sovereignty has already been sold away back in 1913 to the Federal Reserve. \n\nIt's not a truth many people want to accept but it's a fact that those who create money and control the credit of a nation also control the government and the people. The more you know!
won't drive me away. I'll probably be called a Russian shill because I drive popular opinion to the truth rather than than to any propaganda.
How am i not making any damn sense to you? Can you explain please?\n
So the CIA is using their puppets to inform the public of the truth now? Sounds like a dream too good to be true.

There is no such thing as non-partisan news. Corbett does a great analysis of this, ["For generations we have been taught that the ideal journalist is fair, balanced and objective. But the idea of the objective journalist is a myth."](https://www.corbettreport.com/the-myth-of-journalistic-objectivity-video/)\n\nu/EatsPandas said it best. Get your news from everything!\n\nSo including the mainstream news like cnn, msnbc, fox, huffington post, washington post, bbc, new york times, russian times, al-jazeera etc. \n\nAlso use these alternative news/opinion sites (thanks to u/Herculius for creating a big part of this list):\n\n* Corbett report, \n* newsbud, \n* media monarchy, \n* last American vagabond, \n* Jimmy dore, \n* Mike Cernovich,  > via periscope or sometimes open mind YouTube channel\n* Scott Adams,          ^\n* Ron Paul liberty report, \n* bill still,\n*  styxenhammer666, \n* Tracy d, \n* Abby Martin, \n* bombards body language, \n* George Webb, \n* 1791L, \n* ha goodman, \n* democracy now\n* Judicial watch\n* Dahboo77\n* Joe Rogan Experience\n* Middle theory\n* Opperman report\n* The new progressive voice\n* David seaman\n* Really graceful\n* Richie Allen show\n* Drunken peasants\n* The last stand\n* Mundane Matt\n* Barry soetoro\n* X22 report\n* HighImpactFlix\n* Storm Clouds Gathering\n* Sane Progressive\n* We Are Change\n* David Icke\n* STG report\n* amtv\n* Newzsentinel\n* Tragedy and hope\n* stranger than fiction news\n* zero hedge \n* blacklisted\n* Lionel media\n* Finance and Liberty \n* etc. etc. etc.\n... \nSo like u/EatsPandas said, EVERYTHING!

Not only did they delete your thread but removed your post (unless if you did that?). I still think these people are ex-Mormons they are just culturally conditioned to never take a conspiracy seriously... \n\nAlso, I'd like to see that link of the Pace Memorandum you have. I'm curious what it is or means.
Where the fuck were you brigadiers when one of the most thorough conspiracy researches posted his ["How Trump Filled The Swamp"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs0BfPDvUQg&t) video? \n\nYET, you upvoted a fucking CNN article and say how the mods are doing a horrible job? \n\nYes this place has more TD users than not here. While I myself am not a Trump supporter a lot of conspiracy theorist find Trump appealing for his "false song of globalism" speech. If you can't get that through your thick heads I don't know what would!? \n\nThis conspiracy is manufactured by TPTSB and all the evidence can not be shown yet we are expected to believe this shit while decades and decades of past conspiracy researchers have been ridiculed and poked fun of? Now all of a sudden when a conspiracy comes along that plays right into the establishments hand to manipulate you further you eat it up??? I believe Trump does have connections with Russia but to what extent I have no clue, there's no evidence to say how close Trump and Putin really are. \n\nEven if they (Trump/Putin) are close wtf is the big deal? We are allied and protect a country that bans women from driving, cuts of gay people's heads, whips its own citizens for having online relationships with foreigners. Why is there no outcry over that? How much money did Hillary Clinton take from Saudi Arabia? how much did r/politics actually upvote anything of that information to the #3 spot? Give me a break.\n\n# **Good job Mods for tagging this silly brigade!**
>What do you think voting is for\n\nTo give us the illusion that we have a choice and a false belief that we choose our political destiny? 
Yeah you're right. Most Americans and mainstream conspiracy theorist are only worried about what is fast to consume and what their corporate overlords tell them. \n\nGood job CNN on not linking the Russian dossier for people that actually want to read it themselves and not be told how to think!\n\nThis is why the dinosaur media is dying a slow painful death.
Best post in here by far!\n\nAnyone see how this thread is being brigaded? It seems most top post here (ones with high upvotes) are regulars or post quite a bit to r/politics or other subs. \n\nWhile r/conspiracy welcomes anyone and everyone, to just jump on a conspiracy because the mainstream media or the lying alphabet soup agencies tell you to do so doesn't help anything. Just my two cents anyway. \n\nSpez: [The same people who told you that conspiracies are whack and a threat to national security are now telling you it's ok to believe in a conspiracy as long as they believe in it too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0sB0MF3Ozs)
You are drawing ludicrous conclusions that I would ever write that headline because honestly it's a clickbait headline. I would have wrote something like "What is trump talking about when he says 'level playing field'?"\n\nTrump's influence has no real power over the central bankers or their final end game of building a new world order. They have influence, and a lot, over him. You would understand this if you were paying attention. All he could do is slow them down and if he gets too ballsy he will be suicided or lone wolfed. \n\nTrump's words are open for interpretation. If he was talking about deals or trade agreements there would be no need for such ambiguous wording. A magazine owned by ruling class elites, industrialist and of course the Rothschilds has said, almost 30 years ago, 'get ready for a world currency' with the year 2018 under it. You don't think Trump's speech is coinciding with this?\n\nEven Trump said it himself, a lot of people don't understand or even think that something is coming, and it's coming soon. 
Take care my friend, I wish you the best.
Utopian/dystopian stories are the only novels I read besides non-fiction. Thanks for the recommendation!
Do you have a better explanation? I'm only pointing out very powerful people have plans for 2018 and it seems Trump's speech coincides with their plan. Maybe trump is just being secret with is wording for unknown reasons or maybe he truly sucks at making comprehensible sentences. I think it's more likely very powerful people have influence over him and have told him to carry out certain details of their plan.
Fuck over people's minds one day at a time... 
Isn't it obvious to most r/conspiracy users? Trump might have his agenda BUT it does not override the bankers. If it does, he will eventually have his brains blown out. No matter if he's a billionaire and can afford his own security or not, the money creators can always create a bigger fish to eat the smaller fish. \n\nHonestly, if Trump was true to his word about ending the "false song of globalism" then why would the media even give him the time of day? Any publicity is good publicity. On the other hand Ron Paul got jack shit from the media... he was the real threat.
Yeah so much real world evidence like how the US is pulling troops out of eastern Europe (oh wait), how sanctions have already been lifted (oh wait) and how Trump is not threatening a Russian ally (oh wait). So much evidence to suggest Trump and Putin are in cahoots.
lolwat? You are attacking me (another r/conspiracy user like yourself) because I believe, from what I've seen, that Trump and Putin have a relationship even though I clearly admit I have no clue how close that relationship is? Dude, I've never been to ETS! \n\nYou commented on my other post agreeing with me that the mods have common sense to tag a brigade. But here you are telling me I'm tag-teaming with another ETS user to start a new launching point... lol
Thanks! This will defiantly be an interesting read... and quite possibly very disturbing. 
I didn't go to downvote anything in that thread, I just reminded them of a man named Smedley D. Butler.
I remember there was a part of the book (near the end) where a man was in prison with Winston because he talked negatively about the party in his sleep. I think no one in that book wanted to be in that world they were just too afraid and/or indoctrinated to speak out. \n\nWriting this makes me want to read it again...
Obama doesn't set China's monetary policy and Trump is obviously not just talking about trade agreements. \n\n>"As far as the currency devaluations *(He's talking about China)*, I have been complaining about that for a long time and **I believe we will all eventually and probably very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think, we will all be on a level playing field because that's the only way it's fair**, that's the only way you can fairly compete in trade and other things. And we will be on that field and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country."\n\nDo you not see what is wrong with this speech? One country's politicians cannot control another country's monetary policy. Trump also has no control over actions the Federal Reserve takes so what the hell is he talking about? How is he going to stop China from devaluing their currency? Looks like a world currency or a world war to me.
Let's see how the imperialists react to this news.
Hey, thanks for the in depth explanation. That makes sense to me.
Milo deserved the outrage a year ago, not now. But you're right about the misrepresentation of my title. Should have just stuck with the title of the video.
It's actually a private corporation but you're right, it is above the white house.
Anyone who doesn't fall for the mind programming apparently.
Aye, with this logic we are doomed for enslavement. Have a good one.
Question to you. Is it then also ok for the conspirators on top giving the orders to be secretive and rule abiding to avoid disciplinary action?

The largest attack in American history would have no significance if it was committed by agencies within our government...? Think about what he said. This is a smart man saying something completely mind boggling.
The Ukraine conflict started in 2014 and the article you link is from 2015. My point stands, Russia did not invade Ukraine. Regardless if a Russian soldier was captured in Ukraine he was welcomed in by the Russian people of Ukraine\n\nWould you be against Americans supporting Americans in another country if those Americans had been overtaken by an illegitimate government?\n\n But lets say Russia did attack Ukraine. OK, I agree, that's bad but the US having 10x more conflicts and invasions of countries should be even worse to you. Oh that's right, you've been programmed and your thoughts molded to think and feel a certain way about current events. Lay off the propaganda buddy. Take care now.\n\nSpez: Oh I see you are playing tricks on me, they are not active Russian soldiers they are civilians that were once soldiers. \n\n>"The Kremlin has described the two men as Russian citizens, and Russia's defense ministry has said they are former soldiers who left the military before they were captured."\n\nWell I am sorry for my ignorance, Russia hasn't sent any troops that I am aware of to eastern Ukraine. Thanks for the link and proving my original point!
Good analysis/information. There is obviously something more to Trump and Putin than what we are expected to believe.\n\nThing is...\n\nWhy does it matter as much as we are told it should matter? \n\nObvious I don't want the president to be in bed with any foreign government but you do realize it's the bankers/financiers that actually call the most important shots in our government right? They want conflict with Syria/Russia/China/Iran because war is their most profitable business. With Trump that slows things down on the Russian front (US is still building up troops on Russia's border and is now threatening one of their few Middle East partners). \n\nWar still looks inevitable for the future but if the two largest nuclear powers can somehow avoid conflict, **at any cost**, wouldn't that be worth it to you?\n\nAnother question for you:\n\n Is it more important to you that Russia and the USA are now cooling down tensions because the President and Kremlin have ties? \n\nOr is it more important that we should have someone as president that has no ties with the Kremlin and is on the road to war with Russia?\n\n
Tell them that attacking you because you post in r/conspiracy is an ad-hominem. Or could be really smug and say something like, "Being considered "crazy" by those who are still victims of cultural conditioning is a compliment." 
Thanks for this! I've been looking for some more quotes about the deep state to add to my list.\n\nI'll add some myself that aren't listed on that site:\n\n>"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson"\n\n> - President Franklin D.

I know I have a lot of work to do on myself but if you want a better world for yourself, your kids or humans in general, you must throw that shit out the window. Rules should not override what is right. \n\nIf we don't start with ourselves we are doomed for an Orwellian society.
Chances are you live in a country that has its monetary system controlled by a central bank. If so you should tell your friend to do some research on how money is created and who controls the supply of money.

"How fortunate for governments that the people they administer don't think." - Adolf Hitler
Well, I suggest you do your own research and come to your own conclusion. There will always be biased (Assad) and compromised (MSM) sources so you must get your information from everywhere and anywhere.
Adam was asking thought provoking questions, not agressive ones. This soldiers job foremost is to protect and defend the constitution from foreign and domestic enemies yet he has no clue what that means. He's an order follower for the psychopathic elite that slowly erode our rights and liberties but you don't see a problem here because people have jobs to do?\n\nSo I guess you would also do 100% of what the conspirators do because no sense of morality should distract you from your job right? 
You are correct. Most people do not realize the US has been a global power for 26 years now... A global empire that runs off greed and will not give up its power. It will go down fighting which everway the trillons pay for it.
I understand your frustration but we don't live in a time like the French revolution. To conduct any violence against the state is not only suicidal it is counter productive. The state represents ultimate evil and sin. You can't defeat sin with sin or evil with evil.\n\nHere's what John Lennon had to say about dealing with the state.\n\n>“When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you – pull your beard, flick your face – to make you fight. Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don’t know how to handle is non-violence and humor.” ~John Lennon\n\nThe citizens will take as much as they can handle before they come to a revolution in the mind. We need to free our mind before we free our chains. This means you must take away these evil fucks power.  What is that you ask? Well, it's greed. They want more for themselves and less for everyone else. They own the money supply and all the privileges it comes with it. Until we stop playing their game and play our own game of caring and taking care of one another they will own us. They will enslave us all until Humans see each other as brothers and sisters in need of helping each other to grow to our full potential.\n\nDoes that sound like too much feel good mumble jumbo? Then welcome to the world of plunder! Where a group of men living together in society create for themselves a legal system that authorizes greed and a moral code that glorifies it. 
It was a mistype, I meant Eastern Europe and you didn't correct me. The fact that you think US troops are in eastern Ukraine is cute. Shows me how much you understand the conflict...\n\nYou also think I said anything about Trump threatening Russia... I said Russias ally. Which if you have been paying attention is Iran. \n\nYou really shouldn't have typed all this out because all those connections are at best, accusations without proper evidence. Now, don't get me wrong I believe Trump has some sort of relation with Putin but to what extent I have no clue because there is no solid evidence to determine that. \n\nAnyway, I don't buy the programming western media has obviously influenced you to believe. The media (including O'Reilly) have been sabre-rattling against Russia for several years now. They actively seek to mold and sculpt our minds to believe Russia is a real threat and that we all need to oppose Russia whenever and wherever. Lay off the propaganda for your own sake!\n\nHave you heard of the military industrial complex? If you have then you know war profiteers make a lot of money off war and seek it like vultures. Not only that but they have tremendous influence over presidents... not the other way around. Do think Putin doesn't know about America's military industrial complex? So tell me again how you think Russia will prevent US corporations and bankers, who really run the US, from stopping their planned agenda. Presidents do not upset the ruling elites plans, they upset the president's plans. I suggest you do some research into the federal reserve and the word corporatocracy. Take care now.

How about how it took Bush 441 days before an investigation took place into 9/11. Not only that but Bush actively resisted any investigation in 9/11 and even personally asked Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to limit congresses investigation into 9/11. Or how about Tom Kean, Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, said his commission was set up to fail...\n\nThe federal government spent 55 million on the investigation of a sports player. That same government spent only 15 million on an investigation into the largest attack in American history....\n\nLet that sink in. If that doesn't ring any bells or tell you our government is guilty of something then I don't know what would...\n\nSpez: Not trying to be an asshole OP, if I'm coming across one I'm sorry.

Ignoring the biggest conspiracy? Good sir, I'm trying to help you understand the biggest conspiracy. \n\nWar, economic depressions/recessions, inflation, lack of jobs, lowering wages, loss of buying power, lack of education, revolution, suffering, debt. Almost everything important in our lives is affected by money. Putin and Trump do not control the dollar but the banks and financiers do. They create create the money supply not Putin or the Kremlin. \n\nEven if Trump is Putin's bitch it does not matter because Putin is a bitch to the people who create the money supply. The hand that feeds is above the hand that takes. Politicians don't create money of nothing, however the central bankers do.\n\nIf you want to be more informed on this issue I suggest you watch this series called, ["Money as Debt"](http://www.moneyasdebt.net/) or this documentary called, ["Century of Enslavement: The History of The Federal Reserve"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IJeemTQ7Vk). \n\nThe better understanding you have of the money supply, the better understanding you have of who really controls the important things in your life. This is the actually insane happening that is covered by a smoke screen such as the Trump/Putin news.

lulz nice one.
I've discussed this at length with a variety of users on here and from what I've gathered, as well as from my own perspective, it isn't that those of us doubting the Russian puppet narrative are Trump defenders per se. Sure, some of us may be fans of his, most I've talked to, including myself, are merely reluctant to engage in a narrative that was pushed with tremendous vigor by parts of the media we have lost all respect for.\n\nWhen CNN claims the sky is blue, you better go out and check for yourself because what they say is usually selling you bullshit. That means, they may well be right, I'm not denying a motive. On a superficial level, it could be reasonable for Putin to seed chaos around the world by helping people into high office who are sympathetic to his rule, but all that is conjecture.\n\nThere is still nothing indicating Pissgate is true, but plenty of indication it was a seeded story aiming to conjure up doubt and mistrust. It was especially useful to feed feelings of disgust to anyone reading the allegations.\n\nIt seems clear that Trump wants to relax relations with Russia and work in a closer partnership, which only strikes me as a bad thing if you buy into the narrative of "Russia the evil Manipulator". It certainly is within their abilities, I'm not denying that, but it lacks both evidence as well as a clear motive. I'm happy to change my mind, as are many others here, but so far, there's not much there that could bring clarity to this case.\n\nUntil there is, we'll keep digging where there is dirt. If we find something of substance (preferably something that isn't pushed by mainstream media) we'll be the first to shine a light on it.\n\n
Hey bud, the offical story is more of a conspiracy theory than anything else but each to his own. If you want to believe pseudo-scientific, predetermined conspiracies be my guest. The boys over at A&E for 911 truth are doing real science based on facts and evidence.
What these motherfuckers should be attacking is Trump's foreign policy plans to demonize Iran and China. But since the owners of these "news" organizations have a thirst for blood they only attack Trumps warming up relations with Russia. The Trump-Putin relationship is so far only artificial. The US is still building up troops in Eastern Europe and Russian sanctions are still in place.
I think you're right since all nation states that have central banks are beholden to those who create the credit and currency. Thing is if you look at the last few years it seems Putin is cracking down on the banks in his country. This could be one of the reasons why the west is demonizing Russia and Putin. Since Trump won the election they are really pushing this conspiracy that Trump and Putin are in complete cahoots and Trump is illegitimate because he is Putin's "puppet" (of course all media ignores the fact that all politicans are banker puppets). If you search for "Putin and central banks" you'll find more information about this.
I agree, private corporations own the government and the world. They own the media and entertainment which means they control how most sheep think. They control must products that mordern slaves work to make. They control the politicans we elect to "power" and the policies of government. They control the very currency that our lives flow around... We are their slaves because we play their game. \n\n>"International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state." - Zbigniew Brzezinski\n\nAnd to the people who believe that Trump is Putin's puppet is where they want you. Ignore the century of the enslavement we have bonded you too and look over at this conspiracy my slaves. \n\nIt makes me sick and sad... 
Yeah it's not like the Podesta emails were ignored, we are capable of discussing multiple topics for fuck sake.
Sorry! This is not my post. I copied and pasted it from (insert user here If I get to post from my desktop) sorry I made it without any quotes  :(   I thought it was well written and I posted but  got distracted  by being out and about(no service and I'm finally out and about).\n\nThe post came from:\n#u/haveyouseenmymarble
lol ;) The sad reality is many think this way... except just take out the truthful parts and add in more lies
You're right. The truth can never be hidden for too long.
The comments should have been reported a year ago when it was uploaded for hundreds of thousands to see. To say that Milo's comments are just newly discovered is inaccurate. This information is not from recently declassified documents obtained by Wikileaks but a public youtube video from over a year ago.\n\nThis whole event seems very familiar to the media's outrage over Trumps "grab her by the pussy" comment. I don't condone either Milo's or Trump's remarks. I also don't condone using what a person has said in the past as a weapon for nefarious reasons in the future. Call that person out the moment it was known, not when it suits an agenda. I hope I make sense here.
Yikes... If you already know all that then it should be clear to you that powerful people with financial control are able to dominate the political system in each and every country their hands touch. \n\nThese people might not have absolute control over everything but it's pretty damn close, they virtually run the government and practically control both political parties. \n\nWhat you are arguing is small peanuts to them. They could care less if Trump is Russia's bitch, Israel's bitch or anyone else. They control the politicians and at any moment they can upset any government plan. \n\nThe day-to-day workings for most people is the dependence on money to keep going. Important government laws being passed are guided by the controllers of money. Most laws passed are a secondary issue to these powerful groups. If Trump or Putin or anyone else gets in the way of their new world order they're toast! \n\nSo Trump/past presidents and politicians are the small fly in the grand scheme of things. Controlled/compromised by Putin or not, it does not matter. Think tanks, multinational corporations, alphabet soup agencies, the transnational ruling class and especially the central bankers will continue to hold the real grasp of power in our country. The power to affect all of our lives drastically. \n\nYou must understand this. They own the media as well so this is where you fall in the trap that they have laid out for you. This is the reality of it all. You don't want to accept it? That's fine, it doesn't change the facts.\n \nTL:DR\n\nRead this quote and try to comprehend the meaning of it.\n\n>"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws."\n- Mayer Amschel Rothschild, International Banker 
>Moby goes on to claim that the Trump administration is in “collusion with the Russian government, and has been since day one” and that Trump is looking for a reason to go to war with Iran.\n\nMoby has no clue what the hell he is talking about apparently. The comment from Ark Ark in the article explains.\n\n>"if you're going make stuff up at least do your geopolitical homework, Iran is allied with Russia, if Trump is being puppeteered by the Ruskies then he wouldn't be looking to go to war with Iran.
The conspiracy that we are all slaves to a debt system that is never meant to be paid off with money. As long as we go along with the program our rights and liberties will continually erode in the name of "security". Check this site out [Money as Debt](http://www.moneyasdebt.net/)
What the hell are you talking about fake news? Trump's speech is fake news? I'm here asking legitimate questions about the meaning of his speech. Of course he didn't out right endorse a world currency but don't you find it odd how he never describes what a "level playing field" is? The user I was posting to said it had to do with trade agreements when Trump is obviously talking about another country's unfair monetary policy. \n\nSpez: Alan Greenspan former chairman of the federal reserve: "There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take." If the federal reserve/central bankers of the world decide that they want to create a one world currency there's not much Trump can do about it. Well, I guess he could do something about it and end up like JFK... 
If you go to the root of the problem you will find all signs point to the bankers. While not typically called a religion, central banking sure can fit that narrative.\n\n>"It is a religion (private central banking). It's a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood (owners of the private central banks). The fraud persist with often lethal results only because the people are brainwashed into believing that this is the way life is suppose to be and no alternative exist or should even be dreamt of." ~ Mike Rivero
His speech coincides with [The Economist magainzes](https://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/theeconomist-phoenix_get_ready_for_world_currency_by_2018.jpg) cover from 1988 that has 2018 printed on the coin with a caption "Get ready for a world currency". \n\nLooks like Trump is just another puppet to the bankers. One country doesn't have the right to tell another country how to set one's monetary policy. The only way you can have a "level playing field" is if there is one currency that no single country could manipulate.  
I do agree with you it is lousy evidence for a world currency. Thanks for the explanation :)
The only people kowtowing is you, me and the rest of the people for accepting this idiotic system and playing the game that the elites create. Take care.\n\nSpez: Until we all realize the real enemies are the bankers, think tanks, multinational corporations, alphabet soup agencies and the transnational ruling class nothing will change. Our enslavement will only get worse.

> 1) 9/11 as a false flag is not confirmed. Al Qaeda took credit for it.\nWhat makes you think 9/11 was a false flag, so we can go into the Middle East and come out with zero oil?\n\nAl Qaeda? You mean the guys the US is helping right now in Syria? Oh yeah, those guys that the US helped create and mold from the beginning. What hasn't been confirmed is a surprise attack happened that day. Fewer Americans believe in the official story and the way it was told. Do your own research instead of believing in the MSM. If you look at the evidence and data it will confirm that 9/11 is a false flag.\n\nWhat makes me think that 9/11 is a false flag? Like I said if you look at the evidence and data with an open scientific mind and not a predetermined quasi-scientific way like NIST had done) you will see the truth in the matter. All signs lead to a false flag when you do your research.\n\n>2) Russia DOES want to prevent NATO expansionism. This has been shown in Ukraine and Montenegro. And it is mentioned in the article as the main reason.\n\nWe agree. I wonder if we can also agree that NATO is the biggest obstacle to world peace.\n\n>3) Why can't USA get along with Russia? NATO has offered Russia membership to NATO before, at this time Russia was cooperating with NATO. Then Russia went ahead and became an asshole and invaded Ukraine to stop them from joining NATO.\n\nRussia hasn't invaded Ukraine. To say otherwise is to misinform others. People reek of western media programming and conditioning when they say Russia has invaded Ukraine. Again I suggest you do your own research and come to your own conclusion before you spout mainstream talking points.\n\n>4) Ukraine and Montenegro are sovereign countries. If they want to join NATO they should be allowed to join NATO. It's too bad Russia doesn't want to join the party.\n\nI agree! But I wonder if we agree on that countries should also have a right to join a Russian bloc without US interference. (*cough* Ukraine. *cough*)\n\n>5) LOL. Russia's failed assassination is not reason to underestimate them as a threat to the West.\n\nTrue but who's the real threat to who now. Let's think long and hard about this. Is it the former superpower who has an economy the size of Spain or is it the current superpower that has a larger military budget than the next top 11 countries combined? \n\nRussia will continue to be a threat as long as the deep state says Russia is a threat. \n\n>6) The US did not violently overthrow Ukraine government in 2014. That story originated from Russia Today. You got propaganda'd by Russia. Source: http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/19/facebook-posts/united-states-spent-5-billion-ukraine-anti-governm/\n\nAgain do your research. \n\n[Here you go!

Marine Corps Major general Smedley Butler would have been a Tulsi fan too. But you guys don't mention that huh? \n\n>“I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. \n\n>Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service. \n\n> I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. \n\n>During those years I had as the boys in the back room would say "a swell racket".

The NYT/CNN/BBC/WaPo are literally just propaganda pieces for the western banks/industrialist/ruling class/alphabet soup agencies and you posting in r/conspiracy and not knowing this just shows how effective the mind programming has become...
I hadn't thought of it like that. Nice examination.
They monopolize the very thing that makes the world go around and so many people seem to be ok with this... Like this is the way it's supposed to be. 
You have the wrong idea, here's what u/Orangutan and many r/conspiracy users (I think) mean.\n\nIt has more to do with the fact that the deep state has and continues to undermine our representative government (many have already been aware of this for a long time now). The elected government should have more power over the shadow government but it doesn't work that way apparently. It's not advocating anyone shouldn't question their government, I see it as advocating about who really pulls the strings of government. 
I could quote and dissect each part of your comment and tell you that the US hasn't had a president in our lifetime that has ever told the truth. Or how US government agencies/corporations murder, plunder, lie and all sorts of other horrible shit to foreign and domestic peoples. I could tell you about how the US passing laws countering Russian propaganda is exactly what the Kremlin does to it's people and how we are slowly becoming more like them and China. Or how the US has influenced and/or overthrown dozens upon dozens of other countries governments with assassinations and bribes. \n\nI won't do any of that. Obviously in your opinion the two top nuclear powers having a warm face-value relationship is a bad thing because the Kremlin is evil. It's a bad thing because your country is being influenced and not the other way around.\n\nWhat strikes me as the most important issue that you mentioned is this: \n\n>...according to the information coming out it seems like a third option is much more likely to be the case. Trump is a puppet for Putin.\n\nPutin doesn't control the Federal Reserve. Putin doesn't have control over US bankers or even international bankers. You probably don't believe in the deep state but that doesn't change the fact that US politicians (like a lot of politicians that live under a central bank) are puppets to the bankers and financiers. So that third option is rather silly. \n\nDon't believe me or think that I'm silly? Ok. I guess these people were also whacky and looney to acknowledge that fact too.\n\n\n>>"When a government is dependent upon bankers for money,\nthey and not the leaders of the government control the situation,\nsince the hand that gives is above the hand that takes.\nMoney has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism\nand without decency; their sole object is gain." - Napoleon Bonaparte\n\n>“Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce...and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.” - James A. Garfield, assassinated president of the United States\n\n>>"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson." - President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n\n>"The real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city, state and nation. Like the octopus of real life, it operates under cover of a self created screen....At the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers. The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes.

Lookup who Carroll Quigley was and what he did and had to say. Also read his book, "Tragedy and Hope". \n\nSorry for the long post but I need to respond to the ignorance that you think politicians are the real ones in control. They're not.
Contrary to the lies, Russia in eastern Ukraine does not mean Russia has invaded Ukraine. The separatist and majority of the population in eastern Ukraine have claimed independence from Ukraine and the Russian separatists have welcomed Russia. Continue to believe the propaganda and lies of western media war drum beating. Ignorance is bliss.

1. Yes the "concrete" (probably Tarmac) is CLEARLY wet, a little bit of rain doesn't stop motorsports.\n\n2. Yes someone died during the race, that's literally what this video shows. (He edited his comment after so it made sense)\n\nWho are the mongoloids that upvoted this idiot?
It also depends on the type of salt you use, some rock salt stops being effective at around -10c.

I agree with you in a sense but there has never been a religion that didn't muddy the waters with mysticism and straight up said that they were an alien species, not all-powerful gods with mystic powers.\n\nI want to start a religion that supplants myth for more scientific explanations.\n\n"God" was a far more advanced race that came to earth and recognized that we were a useful species and then created a hybrid between themselves and our ancestors to make a hybrid slave race.\n\nLucifer was another race of aliens( or a rogue faction within the original race) that didn't agree with us being used only as slave labor and tried to give us the gift of intellect.\n\n\nThe thing that scares me about that theory is that "the mysteries" (stone masons, Knights Templar etc) also believe in the "luciferian doctrine" and they also believe that Lucifer was trying to save us.\n\n I don't want to be aligned with them but maybe they have just taken the theory too far and are trying to force their vision of the future on us, if you have watched Phil Schneiders talks and believe that he says then this is quite a terrifying subject indeed.

Why are you so quick to call people simpletons and basically just treat anyone who disagrees with you like complete shit though?\n\nNobody is going to listen to your concerns or contrary ideas when you insult them right off the bat and that's basically why Trump won the election, everyone was tired of being called racists and xenophobic uneducated retards for daring to have opinions other than the most liberal ones possible.\n\nIt's a complete fucking joke and you are helping to perpetuate it, if you want people to listen to you then treat them the way you would want to be treated.

I fully agree, I think it's time that we start a religion based around ancient astronaut theory and accept that our biblical texts are nothing more than ancient mans way of comprehending such events.\n\nThe fact that all holy texts have the same fucking story is quite telling.\n\nThey all talk about a "light" (UFO) coming from the sky and then Mary becomes pregnant even though she is a virgin (artificial insemination) and gives birth to a god (hybrid).\n\nThe Torah, the Bible, the Koran, and the ancient Sumerian tablets that predate all three speak of the same events, how is ancient astronaut theory not a religion yet?\n\nEdit: also how the holy texts straight up say that God thought we were beautiful and fell in love with man but then God created us in his image? Yeah that's hybridization and that's where the missing link and our inability to use our entire brain comes from.

There are left leaning echo chambers like r/politics where people wish harm on Trump 24/7 also.\n\nWhat we need to move away from is demonizing people who happen to have other political opinions and realize that there are truths on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nYes Muslim extremists are an issue, yes racism is an issue but just because you support Trump doesn't mean you're some nazi sympathizer and just because you support someone on the left it doesn't make you a communist or whatever, everyone is so fucking reactionary it's disgusting.
Sorry I didn't bookmark any of them, saw them a week or two ago.
The amount of aggressively negative and highly upvoted comments you are getting makes me think you are on to something.\n
Isn't that where Kevin Mitnick was held? I seem to recognize that building from the documentary "Freedom Downtime".
It's okay, downvotes don't mean shit and I don't expect everyone to know what's normal for motorsports.
And what is it that you think I want? I know there are plenty of like minded people out there, I have had many conversations about this very subject with people, some agreed and some did not.\n\nYou think it bothers me when people disagree with my own personal view on our origin? \n\nI don't expect anyone to take anything I say as gospel or even to believe what I say without first investigating it for themselves, I'm not out to convert or convince people of anything, it just seems to me like a lot of people reject the literal translations of the holy texts and have realized that they are just early mans way of interpreting such unfathomable events.

Wondering this myself, I have never had an issue with my banking app.
Fully legal in CA though so go bitch at the law makers instead of raging on bikers.
Or use Metal App, it's FB app with privacy.
I used them for a year or two but they always ended up hurting my hand from gripping the teeny things. Now I use the Black Ice picks, Jazz III XLs or Tortex blues which eventually become the perfect shape once the end is ground down a bit.
The same Mick Wall who was called out in GNRs Get in the ring?\n
Was he hitting the kid with a belt or something? I got that impression from the video.
It just means the produce other than A-grade produce which normally goes to Chinese supermarkets and smaller suppliers like Fruit World or fresho will be sold by Countdown instead. \n\nCountdown are just widening their market share to sell B and C-grade produce. \n
The only indication I see is the shape, nothing  else. Different hardware, neck, frets, tuners. Open it up and see if there's anything on the pots or switch. 
The D string breaks a ton too, that's just a wound high e.
find an amp tech. Try different cables, plug sockets etc.\n\nDo the lights even turn on? ON full volume and full gain do you even hear static? Any burn marks on the tubes or PCB? IS everything connected externally and volume turned up?
Hetfields Eet fuk. Cobains vandalism strat. Dimes lightning bolt ml. Lemmys Rickenbacker. Slashs Les Paul maybe. Paul Stanley's mirror Washburn. Gene Simmons axe bass. 
I don't know either. I've been fixing guitars for 10 years so you pick up a few things.\n\nStraight necks are also really uncomfortable to play.
The band is called The Coup, they're a rap group.\n\nHere's their cover for the album Party Music:\n\nhttps://jamesostafford.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/coup-party-music-original.jpg
It's not going to affect anything but it's certainly sloppy work. I wouldn't have let that out the factory, let alone sit on a shop wall.\n\nIf you're still under warranty I'd strongly consider exchanging it. It'll affect your resale value at the very least as is.
Yes it is. They're all bent. \n\nLook up neck relief. 
I think you watch some shitty movies. Some great films have been released over the past few years but not many have the marketing budget to surface into mainstream view. \n\nGod of Ramen was an excellent documentary.\n\nThe Invitation was an excellent horror (ish) film.\n\nKill List was an excellent movie from the same guy who did Dog Soldiers.\n\nShort Term 12 was a good movie that never quite got past the festival audience in any serious way.\n\nBut that's down to taste as well I guess... the stuff you see in cinemas is what sells, or what they think will sell, not the best filmmaking has to offer. Never has been. \n\nSame with music, the stuff you hear on the radio isn't the best but it's the paid for trough swill shit but we live in a time of great music where the barriers to an audience are thinner than they've ever been (youtube, soundcloud, last.fm etc) and there's some great stuff out there (I don't know your taste so hard to recommend).\n\nSo yes, while I might forget what sub I'm in there's some good creative stuff being released all the time, it just doesn't have the corporate millions in order to be seen.
Totally re7. \n\nOutlast is very repetitive, and the environment never differs. The scares lose their power very quickly and it becomes a grind of run, hide, find, use, repeat. Yawn.\n\nRe7 has atmosphere, plot, excellent pacing and level design, varied environments and a real sense of progress in the story and character.\n\nNot much of a contest IMO. 
You didn't really say that though, plus the title is affordable tube amps. Those laneys will sound better than any amp you listed and they're affordable. 
Where are you based?
What year is the Les Paul standard from?
Nope. Do they make maritime or sailing clothing? Endless ocean is a maritime reference. 
Clean as you go you filthy shits. 
the back pocket of my jeans, on the side of my picking hand. Easy.\n\nI used to put them on my amp but they shake off, and sometimes the amp is 30 ft away and behind other shit. Sticking them in my pocket means they're always there (and they're all the same size), it takes 2 seconds to grab a new one.
8 songs.\n\n4 piece band.\n\nEach person gets a song to cover. Other 4 are originals.\n\nAs for the songs we pick, it's generally ones we all like or would like to play. I find with every song we bring our own styles to the table anyway, the drummer might hit a little harder, the bass player might walk a bit more, I might add some shit, whatever.
Are you paid by the company? This is so one sided, obviously selling a product, and the recent creation of the account makes me suspicious.

Dime, although Hetfield has some glorious solos. \n\nBut who wrote the better songs? Hetfield by a mile.
So? You can buy them anytime you like from eBay.
Nice. I have the head version tuned with tung sol's and winged c power tubes. It's a monster with a gorgeous clean channel and great fx loop. 
I use an sm58 for vocals and acoustics. 
8/10 for me.\n\nIt borrowed the best bits from found footage and other horror games like Outlast and Amnesia. The resi 'feel' is very much intact when you're walking through a big ol' mansion with 3 bullets and then a bad guy appears.\n\nOn the whole it's very good, but it isn't great... and it isn't great because the enemies are very samey (maybe 4 variations on the same theme) and the attack pattern/method of beating them is the same too which doesn't really enrich the story but more dilutes it. It makes sense with the storyline but I expected more variety like fucked up mega-animals, giant plantlife maybe, just a bit more in general which would fit in with the storyline revealed later.\n\nThe last hour is probably the worst (gameplay wise) in the game. The final boss/battle is one of the easiest and most straight forward battles in the whole 11 hours I played it for, and one of the easiest I can think of in recent game history actually and undermines rather than strengthens the story.\n\nI wasn't aware of the alleged hype surrounding the launch so can't speak to that. It lives up to the Resident Evil name though.\n\nSo overall, it's very good with a few problems but they can be overlooked in the greater scheme of things\n\n
He's a 24 year old scumbag who was kicked out of his last band because he "wasn't allowed to do coke during practice". His gear is worse than shit, buzzes like hell, and he disappeared for 20 minutes to the bathroom and I'm pretty sure he was using in their.\n\nThen he left 15 minutes before the end, didn't leave any money for the rehearsal room, and then cancels 2 hours before our next practice which means we still pay for the room.\n\nHe's basically a giant piece of shit with a lot of problems in his life but lacks the wisdom or maturity to actually face them down. I think he'll be dead within 5 years, which is a shame because he's a monster player when he actually pays attention. 
play it loud. Let the speaker move some air.
I just downloaded this on Sunday. What a great game. Definitely has that Resident Evil atmosphere and takes it in a new direction with the storyline and fps perspective. 
Food Alley. Can't go wrong.
We didn't. We had one practice/jam/rehearsal and he was referral from a guy I know at the music store. If he sorts his shit out, he'd be undeniably awesome but I'm 100% not interested in dealing with his bullshit, no matter how good a player he is.
This bodes well for a Resi 8 since it's financially viable, and this game went in some good directions storywise to strip it back form the convoluted mess it was unraveling into.\n\nVery good game, if the bad guys are quite samey.
"The funny thing about HR is that they don't have much humanity, or resourcefulness"
Threaded inserts for neck attachment. It's a way stronger join and you can detach and reattach the neck without stripping any screws or holes. \n\nSimple, cheap, effective. 
Their serial system is pretty cool. The numbers reset every time a new emperor takes over, then start again with (I think) a new letter at the start (kanji in Japanese models).
ginger also prevents motion sickness.
It could be a damaged speaker or one that isn't secured properly causing it to rattle. Any way you can try the amp through a different cab?
Awesome guitars made in gifu, Japan. Your guitar is from the time when kazuo yairi himself was working on instruments and they play classical musical to their finished guitars to open them up.\n\nYou can find a date/serial by the numbers on the neck block.\n\nI think your guitar is bubinga laminate and spruce. 
Little kids drawing in black crayon.
All the kids are back at school. My 15 minute commute now takes 35 minutes because Rosebank Rd is pretty much gridlocked.
Join a band. 
These have the laminated fingerboards and compound radius right?
Ah yeah, the fish hybrids. 
It'd be interesting talking to hetfield or mustaine about their Marshall amps. The boosted 800 with the scooped miss defined the sound of the genre.
Absolutely, the 50 is a brilliant amp.\n\nI have the head version running tung sols with winged C's in the power section and its mighty. \n\nI have 2 different 2x12 cabs. One is the mesa recto cab with the v30s and the other is a custom made one to Marshall 1936 specs, running some 70s celestions.\n\nIf you play metal you'll need a boost though, it's more spongy than a rectifier but way more soulful. Beautiful amps.
Take it back to the store and get a replacement. D'Addario cables have a minimum of a 2 year warranty.\n\nIf they test the cable and it works fine then your jack is fucked.
The 50 sounds way beefier than the 25 btw.\n\nSource: owned both, kept the 50. 
c.i.AIDS
It's in D standard on the record, same as sad but true so I wouldn't think you'd need a baritone for that.
What model are you thinking of buying? They do Chinese, Japanese, and Korean built instruments. 
Nobody has said "in your pants" yet?
Anika Moa - colours are beautiful.\n\nThat whole album is awesome actually.
The mesa is absolutely loud enough. It's ridiculously loud, as all mesas are. \n\nThere's probably the same amount of headroom available between the amps but the mesa has more switching options available and is built way better.\n\nI used to have a DSL 40, traded it for a mesa maverick and then a rectifier 50w. I wouldn't change back.
Reaper as the DAW.\n\nUSB Interface (M Audio Fast Track is cheap and good enough).\n\nVocal mic (spend the good money and get a Shure SM58 and you're done for life, or until you get bored of it).\n\nYou can add drums with software (EZ Drummer is great).\n\nThere are plenty of free VSTs out there to help with guitar sounds/FX too.\n\n
Most custom places making small runs won't charge extra for a lefty. Just finalise what you're looking for and shoot some builders an email, you'll get a quote and a timeframe and then you can start the building process.
what are looking to play?\n\nYou can buy a Laney AOR 30/50 for dirt cheap despite them being pretty much a JCM800 with an extra gain stage.
Engl savage.\n\nListen to heathens album control by chaos, they're brutal as hell. 
You play the amp as much as the guitar when it comes to tubes. 
No, look through the sound hole towards the neck. Get a torch if need be. 
It's rust from the steel end of the truss rod. Nothing to worry about.
The thing that should not be isn't about cthulhu, it's about nyogtha, another god in the Lovecraft mythos. \n\nThe thing that should not be is his nickname of sorts.

Didn't he die and get replaced by a lookalike?\n\n/s
Put some wheels on the fucker. It'll change your life.
Lee Shaw automotive in avondale is the best place I've been to out of maybe 30 different mechanics across nz. 
It could be much worse than he says, it could be just as he says. The only way to know is to have a good amp tech look it over and diagnose the problem. Mk Vs are very complicated circuits so there will be a lot of time invested.\n\nIt could simply be a tube replacement needed, but it could be something else.\n\nIf it's only a year old I'd expect it to be under warranty or have some recourse to get a repair/replacement.\n\nA few red flags though: the courier fee is bullshit. There are no pictures of the actual item, just a bag in a box, and he has some negative feedbacks and a lot of feedback for selling replica pedals (but could be Joyo or some shit).\n\nFor the money there's a couple of rectifiers for sale, or I've got an Express 5:50 I'm 50/50 about keeping to raise money for something angrier, but however you slice it there's options available and this one looks a bit dodgy.
did you know Steve Buscemi was a firefighter and caused 9/11?
Hold a string at the first fret, then hold that same string at the 17th fret. You should see a teeny gap between the 7th and 9th frets and the strings. I mean like the thickness of a business card kinda sized gap.\n\nIf that gap is bigger than that, turn the truss rod to the right. Less so, to the left.\n\nYou haven't mentioned the action or nut height which is most likely the culprit. You change acoustic action by sanding or shimming the saddle so the strings sit lower or higher. \n\nIf you adjust the truss rod leave the strings on there, the neck needs to be adjusted under tension as the truss rod counteracts that tension.
to take smaller photos? Why else would it be there? I shot a campaign for a company who just needed shots at 800 pixels wide for their webpages, shot everything in SRAW which is more than enough info for a 72 dpi png.
Damn. It's a beautiful finish, just can't do the radius.\n\nThat finish is also the same as Chad Kroeger's signature Les Paul.
Yes. If you're desperate you can drill a hole in it then fuck it.
Japanese Curry in Strand Arcade.\n\n
You're polishing a turd and supporting counterfeit enterprising. For me that's 2 big negatives.\n\nYou'd be better off buying an Epiphone off the rack if you can find one. Or if you absolutely 100% have to go to Ali Express please don't get one with Gibson on the headstock.
Check the fuse?
The GBP plummeted at the tail end of 2016 and recovered slightly Q1 2017. I suspect all prices were set in Q4 2016 when the shit hit the fan, and would imagine they'd come down again in a few months when the situation (and currency) have stabilised.
it's a hump in the fret causing a high spot, or 1 fret up.\n\nNo big deal, just needs a file and a crown.\n\nDon't fuck around with action or truss rods, it's not worth changing the whole feel of the guitar it for 1 note. It's a 15 minute job for any competent tech.
Email George:\n\nGeorge.Santos@daddario.com \n\nHe'll set you right.

I've had 3 of these but can never get along with them. I love down the street from Paul crowther and see him play drums every Thursday. He made the original pedal for a bandmate back in the 70s and the design hasn't really changed.\n\nIf the hot cakes had more of an eq section they'd be mighty. 
Artec, Dragonfire, Kent Armstrong (maybe).\n\nAll good upgrades from the stock.
A lighting rig. Makes you way more hirable and deepens your understand of photography.
Sure looks that way with the mismatched years. JD serials apparently stand for Japan Domestic, which makes sense given you bought the thing in Japan.
If it only affected the Chinese then yes, it would be anti-Chinese. As far as I can tell, those rules apply to everyone regardless of nationality or origin.\n\nThere was another front page article today which was more of the same: a Chinese guy couldn't get his mother over because she had Hepatitis B and C, so by the letter of the law can't enter NZ. Fair enough right? It wouldn't be a story if they hadn't mentioned "Chinese" somewhere in the article. It's just the giant piece of shit newspaper trying to fill column inches with mindless shit intended to make people angry.
maybe the jack on the cab is dicked.\n\nHave you tried the different speaker out sockets?
Auckland chiming in. 360% increase in house prices in a generation. 
that would brie an excellent idea.
Warmoth.
Mesa Boogie Maverick or a Mesa Express.\n\nThe maverick is a beautiful little amp with one of the best clean channels ever. The gain is juicy, round and fat, not muscular and tight like the rectifiers. I had one and loved it, but then I joined a rock band and needed more gain...\n\nSo I got the Express which has a clean channel almsot on par with the maverick but more gain available in Ch 2 and the ability to tighten it up with the contour knob should you ever need it.\n\nThey both sound gorgeous and I'd buy either in a heartbeat if I was looking for a warm, 3d, immersive sound and wanted something built well enough to survive a war.
PLease do this DMs. Players write backstory and shit which you can use for adventure hooks too.\n\nExample: I had a dragonborn rogue, part of a hit-squad working for the queen. They went on a job, it was a trap as my squad was the target. I got out alive, everyone else died and I'm being hunted by the queen and this band of badasses.\n\nI go into a bar and a dragonborn (uncommon around these parts miles from home) is looking for someone matching my description. The barkeep didn't say where I was because we're tight and I killed the rats in their cellars (like we do) but they're looking for me and they might know where I am. Maybe I can talk them round and convince them the queen is a crazy megalomaniac, or maybe I'll have to face down my old brothers.\n\nIt's a cool little weave in there to give some characterisation and edge to proceedings.
Police can arrest on suspicion, that's how they differ from a citizen. Police can't charge without evidence though, but that's when you get a warrant because you're suspicious there is evidence.
How does one contact you for a potential commission?
better grip, some kind of material that hardens with force and softens without it... like a non-Newtonian liquid, but for guitar picks, if that's even possible. You can chug and strum with the same pick.
Do you do band artwork?
to an extent, but I use .5mm on my acoustics and 1.5mm on my electrics. Using a 1.5mm on my acoustic and strumming softly still sounds different to using a .5mm
A Duncan Custom with an A8 magnet in there can do anything.\n\nOr get something custom made from any number of suppliers and you'll end up with a better product.\n\nI'd take my custom made MHD pickup any day of the week over anything off the rack.
Nah - clearly scripted questions by the first five reporters, all of which sounded like the Press Secretary drafted or at least pre-approved them.  
Meh - that's essentially how you concede that you've lost the argument. 
I, the Internet Commenter, declare that their numbers are wrong. \n\nThere. I've just provided the same amount of "proof" that they are wrong as SNHR have provided that they are correct. 
I'm having trouble focusing on anything else other than the fact that that the drone is only 150k - I'd be far less surprised if it had three more zeroes.  
Please direct us to emails released by Wikileaks that have "proven to be forged."

Not cool, dude.  This thing is definitely going to last for more than four hours, and then I'm going to have to call the doctor.  
Iran>>>>>>>>>Saudi Arabia\n\nThere have been zero Iran-backed terrorist attacks on the US in the last 30 or 40 years. \n\nThey have much more potential than the Saudis. Iran is the pre-makeover girl in She's All That. 
"A revolution by the people"?!\n\nIt was the equivalent of neo-nazis in DC, MD and VA overthrowing Trump to install Clinton, and being able to do so simply because they happen to live closest to the seat of the federal government. \n\nOf course, they have to be puppet goons hired by a foreign state and George Soros, and then use the US military to go slaughter Trump voters in red states who are rightfully angry that your Nazi brethren overthrew their democratically elected President. 
So are you Azov Battalion or Right Sector?  You seem to love the Neo-Nazis as much as your partners in crime Soros, McCain and Clinton. 
You don't get to throw hundreds of photos all into a presentation, claim that they're all legitimate, be debunked and shown to be lying about large swaths of the photos, and then have people credit the rest of your Qatar-funded operation.  
Truth.  The NYT and WaPo break my heart.  \n\nThey were *great* newspapers 20 years ago.  
That's kind of the Post, as if that's the case, the headline could be restated as "Obama Defeats Al Qaeda In Aleppo!"  
Truth about the boring part.  I 100% think he did that on purpose for the first ten minutes.  Absolutely set the tone for the press conference, settled everyone down and probably dropped blood pressure of everyone by 20 points (by boring people to death), and conveyed to the reporters that there was nothing explosive coming.  
Syria didn't agree with that at all.  And Saudi Arabia hated him because he called them on their bullshit.  They are the ones who have been destabilizing the region with their terrorism.  \n\nGaddafi was elected the head of the African Union two years before his assassination by jihadists.  
Given that she was with the "moderate rebels" that we are supporting, we should celebrate the successful attack.  \n\nUnless we're supporting the wrong side.  
You will likely be surprised at what the international spotlight can do to regime. The vast majority of the western world will be watching intently and hoping that Assad gives them proof positive that he's a murderous dictator, proving them right. \n\nPerhaps even more importantly, Putin will want just as badly to prove all the world wrong, showing that he was right to defend Assad. \n\nIOW, Assad will have incredible incentives to toe the line for years to come. 
Why would they invite an out-of-work community organizer or Theresa Heinz's husband?\n\nI want to be so much snarkier, but for the life of me, I just can't get myself to dislike Mark Toner. He's the only one who seems to dislike having to stand up there and tell bald-faced lies. 
I'm insulted that you assume Hillary doesn't care about me. How dare you assume that I don't self-identify as a weapons manufacturer!
Great piece. One suggestion would be to nix the final sentence. You do a solid job throughout of staying on the "reporting" side of the line, which is a difficult thing to do w this topic. Unfortunately, the last sentence undoes your hard work on that front, and moves the piece back across the line to "commentary."  
No need for the slash there.  Hyperbolic rhetoric is indeed one of the most common forms of inaccurate reporting.  \n\nShe uses the term "genocide."  In fact, she says Aleppo is "a genocide, literally."  Please direct me to evidence of "genocide" occurring in Aleppo.  
Arguably the second greatest trolling moment of the campaign (after "because you'd be in jail").  
This is a random question, but would Syrians object to the government selling the Golan Heights to Israel?  Or view that as "partition"?\n\nThat just seems like a logical option to gain funds for rebuilding and reduce tension between the two countries.  
Syrians don't strike me as big fans of being told what to do in their country by non-Syrians. So, if Erdogan secretly wants Syrians to make Assad President for life, he's doing a great job. Otherwise, he should probably shut his trap on the subject. 
Fortunately for Hillary, after batting 1.000 for ten years, Wikileaks is long overdue to be wrong on something. Any day now . . . 
If they *never* attack Trump or disagree with Trump, then they lose all credibility and are no better that the NYT or Post, and the same goes for us. If we blindly support him instead of his individual policies and decisions, then we're worthless shills just like Hillary supporters. 
OFA and Antifa. It isn't really up for discussion. They admit taking responsibility. 
Confirmed. \n\nPlus, we're now prepped for at least a century of Siberian winters. Our roads and sidewalks will never freeze over again; delicious, life-giving salt is piled high and deep. 
I don't have her paystubs or financial transaction records.  \n\nHer access to Al Jazeera, and the fact that they repeat her claims without seeking to confirm her claims, is highly indicative of a relationship between the two.  
This story is so, SO obviously false.  \n\nHonestly, do you really expect anyone to believe . . . \n\nThat Trump expertly trolled someone?  
Too soon - Trump needs time to clean out the toxic State Dept of people like Nuland and her minions. Can't risk them poisoning the well. 
That's called guessing. 
It was 330 out of all of them (Republicans & Democrats).  \n\nIf there are 330 Republican electors (instead of 306), someone needs to go back and do the math again.  
Haftar is a CIA stooge - he lived a stone's throw from Langley for 20 years for christ's sake.  \n\nIf you want the CIA running Libya to strip it of resources for the benefit of American multinationals, then yea, he's a *great* choice.  
For the record, Snopes is about as unbiased as Eva Bartlett.  They were pretty good at urban legends, but then they started doing political issues and all they do is run interference for Establishment Neoliberal Democrats.  Mainly Hillary.  \n\nOne of my favorites was whether Omar Mateen was a Democrat.  Well, they found his registration with the Democratic Party, an his father showed up a Hillary rally.  But that wasn't enough, because it's "possible" that he changed his mind after registering and forgot to change his party affiliation.  http://www.snopes.com/orlando-shooter-was-democrat/\n\nHere's a good rundown of another one - https://ethicsalarms.com/2016/07/31/bye-bye-snopes-youre-dead-to-me-now/
- When the "rebels" captured Aleppo, Syrian Army soldiers were lined up and executed by the "moderate" rebels.  \n\n- The Syrian Army recaptured Aleppo, and the "rebels" are being relocated to rebel-held territory on green buses.  \n\nAnd it's the Syrian Army who are "monsters."  
World to "inoculate" self from Islamic terrorism by building a sound proof dome around Saudi Arabia.  
If there's an end-troll, it will be a galactic singularity, and the multiverse will reveal itself, as the universe will be simply insufficient to contain the energy.  
We just went through one example.  Anyone who claims that "genocide, literally" is taking place on an al Jazeera broadcast, because a city was liberated from al Qaeda, is a shill.  She's deliberately spreading misinformation -- what you like to excuse as 'hyperbolic rhetoric' -- in hopes of provoking a response by gullible third parties.

Are you claiming that the Caesar photos and report were legitimate?!  \n\nGood good, man - how terrible of a fake do you have to have to get this headline from CNN of all people:  [Syria: Photos charging mass torture by regime 'fake'](www.cnn.com/2014/01/22/world/meast/syria-torture-photos/)\n\nhttp://www.counterpunch.org/2016/03/04/the-caesar-photo-fraud-that-undermined-syrian-negotiations/

It is good that it's by Palma and not LaCapria, who is utterly worthless.  \n\nI agree with the first conclusion - that's easily debunked as the photos were of three different girls.  Actually, how the hell was Palma not able to find that meme - one google search of white helmets recycle girl and it's the first result.  Odd.  \n\nI'm intrigued by Bartlett's statements about the satellite imagery of the Al Quds hospital - hadn't heard that before.  \n\nWait - maybe I'm missing something, but I think that she debunked her own claim in the article.  The claim is that the Quds hospital was bombed in April.  As an aside, I distinctly remember seeing those stories.)  And, in fact, that's the language Palma uses:  "that the hospital had, in fact, been bombed."  \n\nThat is very clear language - leaving no room for interpretation.  \n\nYet the MSF statement then indisputably debunks itself, stating that there were "two airstrikes."  \n\nAirstrike 1 - "a building **across from the hospital**, identified as Ain Jalout school, was struck by an airstrike."  Note that they can't claim the hospital was badly damaged, as it states that they went across the street and then brought everyone back into the hospital for treatment.  \n\nAirstrike 2 - the "Quds staff residence, located **a few buildings down** from the hospital"  \n\n"Buildings in the area were bombed" =/= "the hospital was bombed"  
Southern Democrats founded the KKK and imposed Jim Crow. You apply the same logic to them?
Any sources that don't use the phrase "red diaper baby" and look like they were created on a mid-90s EarthLink account?
What's happening in Aleppo is one of the largest propaganda campaigns in world history.  \n\nWhat's actually happening in Aleppo is celebrations, because the terrorists have been defeated and expelled from the city.  
We had CIA rebels fighting Pentagon rebels, while we tried to balance YPG, SDF, our NSyA creation, and ISIS (which we wanted to direct more than destroy), and this was while we were spending $500M to train "4 or 5 rebels," and while Obama was fighting off everyone who wanted to bomb Assad to the stone age.  \n\nIOW - no one, and I mean NO ONE, can match our penchant for "messiness."  
So has Bush.  So has Obama.  So has Clinton (both of them).  \n\nI'm sure we'll see them all tried for their crimes.

As Caitlyn Johnstone put it, "you don't get credit because you stop torturing someone."
Not in the least.  Podemos is very similar to Bernie Sanders, which is left populism, whereas Trump is right populism.  I donated a lot of money to Bernie, but I always knew that Trump was my second choice.  \n\nLeft and right populism aren't that different; they're much closer to each other than they are to the Establishment parties (both neoliberal).  \n\nFrom observing what has occurred in the EU, and then what occurred here, I realized that while I might prefer left populism from a personal perspective, there is no question that right populism is a much more effective tool at defeating an entrenched establishment.  \n\nEssentially, it's Dr. Jekyll (Bernie/Podemos/Syriza) and Mr. Hyde (Trump/UKIP/AfD).  If the Establishment isn't that strong, left populism can work (happened w/ FDR after the Depression).  Unfortunately, however, they get steamrolled when the Establishment is deeply entrenched, with Syriza being the most brutal example.  \n\nSo, when Dr. Jekyll is too weak, it's time for Mr. Hyde.  
Really didn't think I needed to add the /s to that one.
Wait, wait, wait - I actually think we need Evan on this one, because there is a zero-point-zero percent chance that we have a custom-made, one of a kind deep water drone that only cost $150,000.

It's going to take a lot of years, but Syria will ultimately be seen as Obama's singular achievement.  It will be similar to JFK's performance with the Bay of Pigs.  Both instances of young(ish) Presidents displaying an unfathomable amount of backbone to stand up to the all-powerful War Party.  \n\nJFK's was a much more intense (and short) episode, but Obama gets docked because it was a trap of his own making.  \n\nObama's biggest mistake will eventually be recognized to have been appointing Hillary.  
Did you see the video of Syrian Army soldiers beheading the Palestinian child?  \n\nSorry, I spelled "moderate rebels" wrong in that sentence.  
Fun trick - you can almost always go to archive.is and read articles that are behind paywalls.  Just copy and paste the link address.  \n\nAs for Libya, that article should have information about the "rebels" making up the same types of stories that they making up in Syria with an eye toward triggering foreign intervention.  In Libya, they claimed that it was a genocide, that Gaddafi was bombing civilians, that he was slaughtering people in the streets.  \n\nIn that article, they provide great data on who was killed in Libya - noting that it was something like 95% adult males - which is the best proof you can have to refute claims of killing civilians.  If only adult men are dying, it means the other side is not killing people indiscriminately.  \n\nThis link summarizes what's arguably the most important document on the subject - the UK's recent report that absolutely eviscerated David Cameron:  http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/09/libya-2.html\n\nHere's some other good reading:  \n\nhttps://levantreport.com/2016/01/04/new-hillary-emails-reveal-propaganda-executions-coveting-libyan-oil-and-gold/\n\nhttp://www.telesurtv.net/english/analysis/How-Hillary-Clinton-Lied-Her-Way-to-War-in-Libya-20160318-0008.html\n\n
You can also protest death and/or taxes, but it's not likely to change the outlook. 
This is correct for the Pentagon.  The CIA, however, has far less scruples about who they arm and fund.  If we weren't arming and funding Nusra, Ahrar or Zenki, Tulsi Gabbard would not have introduced legislation titled Stop Arming Terrorists Act.  
It won't be reported this way, but he just slammed Hillary for her "deplorables" comment.  He talked about the coalition he put together in both campaigns, and then said that the main reason he was able to do so was that he "cast the broadest net possible," and made sure that everyone knew that "we're all Americans first."  \n\nSounds a lot more like Trump than Hillary.  
Good point.  That trend drives me nuts in the US.  \n\n[Eisenhower](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/General_of_the_Army_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_1947.jpg/220px-General_of_the_Army_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_1947.jpg)\n\n[Petraeus](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/dd/7f/e4/dd7fe4f1d65628e7ae906ef3133f311d.gif)

Fun fact - you could add "AGAIN"
I honestly don't see that sentence as at all cheering death.  Perhaps antagonistic for using "terrorist", but it seems like an entirely normal way to phrase the most logical responsive question to the headline of the article.  \n\nJust my two cents.  
Bullshit.  Al Qaeda agreed to allow evacuation of wounded from Fua and Kefraya as part of the agreement, and they have now reneged completely.  https://twitter.com/aenqa/status/809769622719369216
Fuck the emails anyway. Side show to the Foundation. \n\nSpeaking of which, the foundation is a separate legal entity that stands on its own. Investigating the CF =/= investigating HRC. 
Yes, because it's not the CIA who lies, it's Wikileaks . . . 
Both are correct.  Although "massacred" is probably an exaggeration.  
Yes, yes we are.  Here's a good place to start:  http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/samantha-power-un-us-ambassador-america-syria-aleppo-massacres-srebrenica-rwandan-genocide-bizarre-a7476556.html\n\nAssad's no saint - far from it.  He's not Saddam, but pretty damn bad.  I'd put him between Saddam and Gaddafi, none of whom we should've overthrown.  \n\nedit - note, however, that overthrowing Assad is a long-term CIA goal (because it went so well in Iraq, Iran in 1953, and everywhere in between).  We have been arming the insurgent groups since 2006 and arming them since 2007.  http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/37685-the-war-against-the-assad-regime-is-not-a-pipeline-war  In other words, it's not all on Obama.  
They're already cleaving into four. Left-Right and Elitist-Populist (or Globalist-Nationalist). \n\nClinton-Bush-Sanders-Trump\n\nRight-Elitist (Bush) is in the worst shape bc they have no natural constituency, whereas Left-Elitist have big cities and identity politics. 
MoonOfAlabama - as much for the comments as the daily post
Between the two -- Nusra, Ahrar, Zenki, etc. and the SAA -- there is most definitely a lesser evil.  \n\nWhen those terrorist organizations captured Aleppo, they lined up SAA soldiers and executed them.  \n\nThe SAA has now retaken Aleppo, and the "rebels" are being peacefully relocated.  \n\nPerhaps you can't see a difference between the two.  I do.  
That has nothing whatsoever to do with your comment. You claimed that emails released by Wikileaks had "proven to be forged."  Chain of custody and ability to charge do not read on your claim. \n\nAgain, please direct us to emails released by Wikileaks that have "proven to be forged."

LMFAO. Lynn is a homewrecker and just as dirty as HRC. While she is correct that John was the asset who leaked the whole scam, Clinton destroyed itself. The fact someone like Lynn is openly musing about this is a clear signal that Podesta is on the outs and I will be shocked if there is not a plan to make him the fall guy. \n\nLynn was a friend of HRC going back to the mid 90's. Between sponsoring conferences, dinner parties and networking I would wager Lynn and Evelyn have spent upwards of 20mm GBP on HRC. 
The short answer is yes. The DCMA makes all internet communication and communication centers (read: Forums) under the Communications Act. Which means that manipulation of information without the consent of the counterpart who signed the Terms of Use opens the Vendor (Reddit) up to class action lawsuit. It also can lead to requests for discovery. Which in itself can lead to a class action lawsuit and appeals for anyone who may have been caught using Reddit for illegal intentions or was convicted on evidence found on Reddit. \n\nSome cases off the top of my head which this would be applicable to:\n\n- Anyone arrested in "The Fappening" where thousands of Celeb nude photos used in blackmail cases were leaked on Reddit, leading to the arrest of 4 hackers who posted them.\n- The Warrant Canary

You can not "take down" George.

If this post goes Viral, I'll happily post more on this insight to get everyone started. Insider networks bother me deeply. It gives the perception society is biased and is against everything the Founding Fathers set out to make the USA not become.\n\nYou would need to start with FOIA's and Tax Files for major offshore donors. Then you would need to find methods to pull the charity status for non-charity activities. \n\nThe first place to look is Panama files, and then find a method to get a similar leak for Singapore and Hong Kong. \n\nI'll hang around for a day or two and see what happens.\n\n
Gawker did publish the flight logs for Epstein, and they also played a major role in the early Clinton Impeachment by way of Wonkette. \n\nThe Gawker takedown was purely related to Gawker's choice to "sell out" and tack from covering true society scandals to doxxing and harassing targets who lacked the resources (lawyers, money) to fight back. Gawker over the period of 2005-2016 was notorious for targeting low level RNC and neutralist socialites that led to severe damage to both professional & personal lives, often glossing over the liability exposures with blog post redactions and no apologies to the "fake news" targets. \n\nTheil has had a wild life. Anyone who has read the legend of Paypal can come to that conclusion. The Gawker/Hogan event, like the other 2 cases he supported were targets of opportunity. He lived in a glass closet and saw this as his best chance to shut them down. I would suspect this was done with the quiet support of others who live in the glass closet in Silicon Valley & Burbank society. Often being outed as Gay will have severe implications for your company and the investors. Many countries, Saudi Arabia being one will not conduct business with an openly gay CEO. The higher up in society you get, the more you come to realize most decisions such as the Gawker takedown are done in consensus, much like excommunicating a bad teen from high school society. \n\nTo imply that Theil or his clique is protecting Epstein (Wexner) or the Clinton Cabal is false. Theil, Prince(DeVos) and that clique of MIC's have a very low opinion of the Clinton post-2003. \n\n
Zero. Thanks for point that out. In the US, there should be the death penalty for sexual assault.
Sure. Brain Damage is easy. Talk to any of his old friends or just look at some pre & post interviews (say, Black Album vs. the Taylor Swift Incident)\n\nhttp://empirenews.net/source-of-kanye-wests-talent-discovered/\n\nAs dumb as this sounds Will.I.Am should be stepping in about now to help Kanye out of this mess. For much of the same reasons he took on Fergie and collaborated with Beiber & Spears.\n\nStepping back out to watch the threads. While Kanye is a tragedy, the "Alt-Right" should focus less on the distraction that is Kanye in a brain-trust and back on what matters to the millions of US voters: Sex Crimes, Bribery and your Government's non-sanctioned Grey areas. (I'm so funny ~sic).\n\n\n\n
Jesus Christ. This is dumb. \n\nKanye West was a gifted and talented Rap star. He got into a massive car accident which basically left him 35% brain damaged. Crushed Skull, full frontal lobe bruising; Like Gary Busey. The Kanye who came out of the surgery room and rehab was not the Kanye West pre-2002. \n\nBack story:\n\nhttp://globalgrind.com/3880177/kanye-west-car-accident-11-years-ago-full-story-photos/\n\nNearly all of the Kanye West we know and love, from Late Registration to 2013 was mixed and produced during the early period of rehab. His brain was still adapting and the major neurological damage had not set in.\n\nPr-accident, KW was a pretty normal guy. You would consider him a proto-Drake, heavily influenced by Religion and family (his mom).\n\nPost-accident, KW suffered partial memory loss, aggressive outbursts and most of the symptoms of both a Brain Trauma case and early onset BiPolar disorder. He was strongly encouraged to leave the rap game due to his lack of integration with the East Coast scene and his dwindling social skills. \n\nKanye was flying (coke or aderall, nobody knows to this day) the night he drove head into that car. Kanye also has enough mental presence left to recognize there is a stark difference between who he was pre-2003 and post. \n\nCarter treated KW like shit while he was under contract at Roc. That is well known inside the industry. For his entire run he was originally paid US30,000. A pittance and an insult even in 2001 standards. While KW views JayZ and his crew as his friends, the feeling is most definitely not reciprocated. Quite the opposite infact. \n\nFor industry insiders this is a shame, as KW is literally a mentally ill man being paraded around by "friends" & family for their own gain. \n\nUCLA is an advanced treatment center. Its not a MK Ultra brainwashing program. If only the world was really that cool/Hollywood Movie-like. \n\nNIMH works on psyche repair for war trauma, amid other programs. None of which remotely are tied to Black Programs. All the research is lit, and you can see exactly what 3 PD's are working on Kanye at the moment. \n\nHis sleep schedule indicates this is likely a chemically generated breakdown. Nobody stays up for 48 hours naturally. If you listen to the 3 recorded "outbursts", he likely was on cocaine or aderall again.\n\nThe guy who pulled him off was the stage hand who likely was told to step in before Kayne totally lost it. This was likely done by the tour manager who pulled funding after seeing Kayne for the second night on uppers and off his bi-polar's. KW is over $55mm in debt, so the manager stepping in to pull the tour bridge loan is the most likely reason for explaining the cancelled shows. Line this up with the underwhelming record sales of St Pablo and most of the conspiracy theory becomes a benign story of stress + brain damage. \n\nKris likely checked Kanye in, with the approval of his local manager out of fear for what he could do on microphone. KW has no signing authority over his own accounts for the above reasoning. Lack of impulse control means you cant get a corp loan. Between his understanding of the Roc Fella 1990's and the Cocaine trade and the LA 10-Oak sex rings, he knows just enough about the dirty underside of the entertainment industry to be dangerous to himself and Kim. \n\nThe TLDR: \n\nKanye is a literal insane man who is being enabled for declining record sales. He has no friends and professionals not inside the Rap Game (aka. circle jerk) legitimately feel sorry for him. His unchecked mental decline has made him hard to deal with, but it does not negate from his tragedy. You can witness this and how "normal people" interact with KW most clearly in the Bloomberg leaders series events alongside Ben Horowitz. \n\nKayne is a product and this is not the first time mental illness has been paraded around for an agenda. Nor the last. Its just RedPill's can start to see what your Celeb's are, in all their busted glory.\n\nSource: Google me.\n\n

Some high level thoughts:\n\nFirst, Rothschild is the most well known but neither the largest nor most active Family Dynasty in the world. A quick tear through the Davos, St. Petersburg and Milken Conference lists can find many of the true "big fish". Bloomberg has a few good studies on the most reckless SFO's. \n\nSecond, Soros is but one of many. Third, everyone saw how hard it was to take down Steve Cohen at SAC. Exposing Open Foundation or Soros is a red herring and will not be practical. \n\nLastly, Soros is easy to smear but he really is not the bad you are seeking. That is not defending his investment in BLM or AGITPROP programs globally, however he has very clear limits as to % of total donations & gross exposure to an event. He is, as dumb as this sounds, a very small fish in the Agitator scene.\n\nBut if you really want to rattle his chain:\n\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-23/company-center-criminal-fed-leak-probe-was-just-sold\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/05/11/dont-hear-george-soros-ties-30-major-news-organizations.html\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203476804576614442587262696\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/business/worldbusiness/14iht-soros.1974397.html\n\nOne would also likely want to ask how Soros tends to set up his trades. He has a very particular style and like Omega Partners it is very common to everyone in the market.\n\nTo be honest, you would be better serviced focusing on the big fish like Sov. families: el Saud, etc etc. \n\nTo be even better: I would steer the community towards focusing on outreach and "low energy" voters who do not understand how important it is to make jobs and WHY trump is so good for MAGA.\n\n\n\n\n
I think the 1 question we need to ask JA is the backup for statements he made over the past 5 years. If you look at the File Dump in October, there has been issues with what is true "bombshell leaks" as well as various moments he has walked back his "Revelations", including his big "Hillary Announcement". \n\nThis accountability ties into the Hash changes to the insurance file. The AMA should frame what sort of "social contract" wikileaks wants with its followers, so that people treat it as an information broker (like a Intelligence clearing conduit such as Eurasia) and less like a cutout/propaganda arm.\n\nJA also needs to explain in some manner why he vanished off the grid and the failsafes triggered. Did he intentionally set the Deadman Switch's fuse on twitter or was it unintentionally activated when the Embassy cut off his connection.\n\nLastly, Wikileaks needs to determine how JA can verify his integrity to the public. In the case of websites the "Canary Clause" has proven effective. Going forward, whistleblowers will need a similar setup to ensure Wikileaks can not be tampered with. \n\n\n
To answer your question. Yes.\n\nWithout saying much more, but giving you an idea of public facing US Gov Entities within 5-eyes:\n\n\nhttps://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/terrorist-financing-and-money-laundering-investigations-who-investigates-and-how-effective-are-they\n\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Financial-Action-Task-Force-(FATF)-Evolving-in-its-Effort-to-Combat-Money-Laundering-and-Terrorist-Financing.aspx\n\nAnd nothing is too high level. There is only 4 ways out of the SDR and everything, like TOR is tracked by someone. Even if they evade FATCA. \n\nI really think someone should take "meme magic" out for an Italian Tuneup this weekend.
Its not that no one would play, it just gets more people to play. Most people will play a game or two for the pack, which means people who really like tavern brawl have more people to play against. Also, when it is an exceptional brawl, people are more likely to try it and find out. I generally play only for the pack, but this last brawl I played nearly 20 games and had a BLAST, which I may not have done if I wasn't incentivized by a (though mostly useless to me) pack to atleast give it a try.

I was also arguing idealistically. I have relatively little knowledge of the courts, and can make no first hand claims, but I do believe they are not equal, based on what many of my friends have done and gotten away with.\n\nI do not think the courts are regularly acting in this way, just stating perhaps this time they were.

I meant in the agro matchup, like if you are expected to heal for 30 by turn 6, how can control warrior or priest hope to remain competitive against those agro decks, as they obviously can't do that. In the control matchup, Brann Kazakus usually wins it.
I don't really buy that logic, considering DotA makes loads of money off basically only skins. I think the trade off is that if you just have more people playing (which also attracts more people, which is double dipping on this benefit) they will be more encouraged to play, which makes them want to buy skins more often, which seems to work for DotA.

It is far too filled with emotion to be effectively and routinely applied.\n\nIf you mentioned personal responsibility in relation to who is found guilt, that was not at all part of my post. It was about not to ruling, but what comes after, though I may just be misunderstanding you were, just wanted to cover the bases.\n\nIf you mean personal responsibility one has to not be a dickhead, ie to not break the law and should thus be punished, that is what breaks down into parts. If they are a risk of still being a dickhead, thats could be a reason to punish them. If punishment would remediate their dickheadishness, that is the other reason to punish them.\n\nI am not trying to make any sort of argument the child was not in the wrong, just weather or not the courts was the best place to handle it, in a manner of speaking (more that if jail was reasonable or not).\n\nI would assume those things are already illegal, its more of them bending the laws in my mind. We don't need more rules in that sense, just better oversight. Good point to bring up though, why even discuss it when we could just prevent the discussion from even needing to happen.
Totally not true, she looks younger honestly...
Nothing in Runescape matters, friend, don't see how mentioning that really adds much to the conversation...
You have to keep in mind this would buff them all, granted Arma may see a much greater impact, if getting KC is more common (IE shorter trips). I don't do GWD, so I can't comment on specifics, but isn't GWD usually filled already? Bandos, though the best, seems to be filled whenever I do slayer there (spectrals), are the other ones usually filled as well? If so, I would think this would be a bad changed, as GWD is already good enough for players to do. If Arma is rarely done, maybe this has SOME merit to me. Just thoughts.
Do we not have a duty to help our fellow man? Yes, there is a line, you can't expect everyone to just give everything they own to the needy, but I would say we are not at a good point right now. Should people be starving while we throw away food? Should people go thirsty while we waste water? Seems difficult to say you live morally with these issues.
Reno doesnt cause them to be played, but to be printed. Plus, when Reno decks become weaker to agro, then Midrange can come back into the meta, which has a decent matchup against Pirate, but a bad matchup against Reno (in my experience, at least.)
I totally agree with the idea that people wrongly think they need to own everything. I only need 21 more champions and in the last 30 games I have played 3, out of 90 something owned. Same thing for Hearthstone; I only play a single class, so I only need to own ~1/5 the cards to have a "complete" collection, the focus really keeps the cost and grind down.
Are you talking about the Oregon Experiment linked below?\n\nBecause, unless I have made a mistake, their conclusion appears to be inconsistent with your assessment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS This randomized, controlled study showed that Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years, but it did increase use of health care services, raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain.
Too be fair, some of the mechanics you described are, somewhat, in the game already.\n\nExodia? There are a couple such combos in wild, such as evolve kobold mage, which kills in one turn form hand.\n\nDimension shift sounds alot like Ice block - you effectively guarantee yourself another turn of play.\n\nThey just don't look the same.
Could be a symbolic stand for what they believe. In a a political climate of such cynicism, some still stand strong.
I find it almost sick the love of the jewish aspect of the Holocaust. Yes, ~6mil jews died in the Holocaust, and not to discredit their sad deaths, but an additional ~5mil other peoples died in same deaths, no? And there deaths are hardly ever recognized. I am not sure most people even realize ~11mil died, because the ~6mil jewish deaths are fanatically repeated.\n\nWhy do the other ~5mil not matter?
If it was like 16-18, that would be considered prime, or 22-26, thats another prime, but I don't really think a pimply and weak 13 year old would really be considered in his prime.
Not sure if we are reading different pages, but about a third down it says "Total US coal miner employment" which has gone down. It has remained steady for around 20 years, but has had a significant (~50%) drop form around 30 years ago. Am I mistaken?\n\nThough I doubt many people are complaining that they lost their jobs 25 years ago.
Because this Pope is far more progressive than other recent Popes. So it is not surprising that the progressive ideology would then support this leader of the catholic faith.
 Another possibility is that the Y axis represents relative change, and not absolute. Obviously does not justify such blatant misinformation, just another answer.
How is that necessarily ridiculous? For instance, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, ["The rate of exposure to sexual offences has remained relatively unchanged, according to the SCS, since the first survey was conducted in 2006, despite an increase in the number of reported sex crimes. **This discrepancy can largely be explained by reforms in sex crime legislation, widening of the definition of rape, and an effort by the Government to decrease the number of unreported cases.**"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden#The_Swedish_Crime_Survey) (Emphasis mine)\n\nAnother possible explination is ["Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden#Statistical_factors)\n\nNow is this completely definitive? No. It does show contrary to popular opinions, though.\n\nIn regards to my comment, what if the definition of rape was broadened in the US to include lewd comments and cat calling. We would obviously see a great upturn in rape cases, though it is hardly fare to argue that rape is that insane high in the US compared to other countries, in this example.\n\nNow, is the definition of rape broad enough to account for this change? Maybe, maybe not, but it is a discussion worth having, and casually dismissing it is rather nonsensical to me, as without the link between the systems, no meaningful relation between the results can be made.
Masterful, please submit to SGDQ.
Very true. That is the catch-22 of discover; it makes more meaningful interactions and lets you use more cards, but at the same time makes it harder to play around cards (especially paveling book and Cabalist Tome, in my experience, though that could be a result of mage just having 10 types of removal and 10 types of AoE all which function effectively the same).\n\nThere is a fine line, which is important. Dr OP is a problem all unto itself, as you really never want anything else. The only other cards you would really EVER consider taking from a netherspite is Ysera or Guardian.
I know its cool to hate on these people, due to jealousy of their wealth, and rightful distain of their actions, I have another point to make, I do believe in afluenza.\n\nThe judicial system has one of three possible purposes, in my eyes: to demand retribution of the wrongdoer, to reform the wrongdoer, or to protect society from the wrongdoer. Which you believe it aught to be is, in my eyes, somewhat foggy. Ideally, it would be to reform and protect, and not a tool for people to seek vengeance with, so keep that in mind.\n\nHuman's are a product of their environment, and as such, a child's personality, as far as I see it, is wrought from their parents upbringing (though I find in life I can't always blame the parents, myself). Would it be right to punish the child for it's parents upbringing? Revenge would best be pointed towards the parents, but he had not that power. If the judge believed that the child posed no danger to society, why keep the locked up? They were no threat. How would jail work to reform a child suffering of this psychological issue? The problem would be best fixed by therapy of some sort, and since they are no risk, it can be done from the ease of their own home. Though, maybe I am overstepping my bounds on what the judge thought. Maybe he is just protecting his own interests, or was bought off. Just my two cents.
Also can show why the region can dominate. How many Western streamers do you see keeping such an eye on every lane?
You're right, its a little disgraceful to children for us to suggest they are like the president. Most children are much more mature, sorry.
Seems pretty innocuous to me, maybe I am missing some major context, but the tape itself didn't really raise my ire at all. Seems a bit blown out of proportion to me.
Ah, you see, but thats why this is what we call *evidence* and not *proof*, and it may suggest a conclusion, but does not, yaknow, actually prove it. Your title is pure sensationalism.
Why does he feel the need to mention Christian? Why does religion have any real meaning here? I can see it only as a way to defame Islam as a threat to western religion, and so to justify a "muslim ban", though others argue that it is not, in fact, a ban on muslims. It seems this tweet suggests it is either a ban on muslims, or that the president is attempting to make it look that way to please constituent.
Does Cwarr have a good matchup against Pirate? Interesting, I suppose their ample removal may save them, but its still a little hard to believe, for me.

Hmmm... Could there be a difference between a refugee ban and a total immigration shutdown?
Very true. There are very few good taunts left, and now warrior has 3 of them (bloodhoof, Monkey, Alley). The only other taunts really played are sunfury, Twilight guardian, and Wyrmrest Agent. Interesting.
Yes, but age undeniably can hurt mental capabilities. I also heard some people claim they would not vote for him because he could have died during the term (although that was mostly from the Trump supporters I knew, so maybe it didn't really matter much).
Ryze is such an enigma to me. Every game he seems to get huge, be unkillable, and burst tanks and carries alike in seconds. Yet he still seems to lose 50% of the time; I just don't get it.
Even with the "rapefugees" [according to Numbeo, which is used as a source for main reputable institutions, including Forbes, BBC, The Economist, and China Daily, Sweden is still safer than the US](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp).
Peak physical/athletic condition would be mid 20's I believe, which was the second time I gave. Another "prime", peaking early, such as 16-18, would be a youthful prime, in more of a sexual nature, with inflated value of being more virginal and unsoiled. That would be my theories, at least. 
I have seen adds similar to the last two before.
Played a few games, seems to be like this\n\nMage - S\n\nFlame waker, Mana Wyrm, plenty of burn, only issue is a real lack of draw (only AI) so they are not THAT consistent I guess.\n\nDruid - A\n\nMore spell draw than Mage (lunar visions, raven Idol, nourish) and some nice heals (if you feel you need them, Healing Touch and Tree of Life) and decent burst (though not really enough to OTK it seems). Things like innervate fandral are even MORE op now.\n\nPally - A\n\nCrazy amount of heals and pretty good cycle (Hammer, Lay on Hands, holy wraith, Solemn Vigil) and can spawn a pretty crazy turn 1 OTK with boar + tons of buffs and cycle.\n\nThe deck I suggest everyone try after those three is [this one](http://i.imgur.com/WSmri94.jpg). A priest gadget OTK deck. It has a unique ability to combo with Gadget compared to other such decks is that you have enough healing to survive it all every time. You don't need Violet Illusionist, or even full health, to pull off the combo, which I would think would make it more consistent, even though you need to draw a bit more to reach your burn. It's issues lie with it being much slower to the upper tier classes which can kill turn 1-2-3, this deck is tied to turn 6 for the combo. That is also why Druid may make a better version of this deck, as turn 2 or 4 are your explosive turns, but I havn't tried it.
That would be part of the answer, IMO. The ladder does gradually get harder as you get higher, and you will often plateau, but 17-18 is where alot of people get reset to aswell.
Well, if you can't get new players playing, then the game is risking to die out.
Thats what I was thinking. America's GDP is 5 times Germany's.
"raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain." All sound like positive effects to me.
Now I can sorta see why the last one was not done, seems like alot of text. Hopefully they start to get to those soon, they are pretty interesting.
Isn't arma already good money? Not really sure it needs to be buffed.
What are these problems that the entire left unobjectively (sic) turns a blind eye to?
The flip side to this is that it could provide an unfair advantage. Much in the same way that we have gendered sports to make it more fair for girls (though it is most likely not the only reason), in younger ages girl are often much more developed. While you may argue that the competitive integrity of children's sports should play second fiddle to fun and togetherness or whatever, I will not disagree in the slightest., just trying to put another perspective and add some thought.
Well, if they release alot of cards that depend on cards that use positioning, is that not still adding depth to positioning? You have to imagine ways to sneak value out of these cards by combining them with other card effects which are not necessarily immediately understood.\n\nA few more positioning cards could be good, but releasing cards which can have interesting interactions with them could be more effective and interesting.
True, the items have a bit too much versatility. It looks like they wanted to try and buff high damage champs so that they can be a bit more forgiving (Rengar's CC immunity, Edge of Night), which can make them more fun and less all or nothing, but without a nerf to damage it just makes them broken. In my mind, we will either get a nerf to damage across the board to make them more inline with their CC immunity, or a nerf to the CC immunity itself.

Income inequality is fine, it will happen, but when it is so extreme it can lead to problems that smaller version of it do not. Also, personally, for it it has always been more about the companies that shelter income and tax breaks on companies that don't really seem to need them, than on a few rich people, but it all sort of wraps up into the same stream.
After watching this these, I see why the 4chan crowd like him. He is an edgelord. Just trying to ruffle feathers to get a reaction because he wants attention.
It does seem a little far fetched to have a script for this specific of an even, but I don't watch Gosu so I can't really comment on if I have ever seen any questionable plays.
I don't think Lethality is that strong, it seems like the items just have more pen then before. Maybe thats what people mean, and I just misunderstand them, I guess, but the mechanic itself seems okay to me.\n\nNot to mention, I feel most of those champions built armpen already, anyway.
Then in what way does your comment apply?
Well, since it had a rather "over achiever" vibe of commencement, I don't feel anyone would suggest it is being "forced" on her to do so. Nor would CPS roll up if she did not do so, so it is hardly "properly providing" of her. I would say it is less a bias, and more of a realistic representation.
The thing of it is this would also have to be a recent bug. I have personally played probably 200 games with a caitlyn and cannot recall a single time this has happened (it would be pretty crazy to see what appears to be either scripting or insane mechanics, thus memorable.)\n\nThe videos do appear to prove that cait traps can have collision issues, but in the Gosu video, he doesn't appear to collide with it the same way the videos show. In the videos it is a very subtle movement around, but in the Gosu video it seems like a very clear dodge, not just walking into a small object, but going around the hitbox.\n\nThe videos do prove there is a possible collision glitch, though, so it does lend some credibility to that, but does not disprove very much, atleast for me.
This man is the President of the United States of America.
For quite a while there he was a bit of a joke. Definitely not super played.
I disagree. Jade does not win quickly enough to force out midrange agro. Midrange Hunter and Shaman are not really that scared of Jade Druid, I believe, only 2 taunts, and 2 heals does not make it very scary.\n\nLook at it like this, without Reno, what control decks would be able to beat Pirate warrior right now? I am not sure many, and that is the cause of Reno and Pirates.
Yeah, symbolism does not exist. I'm not saying that it is a movie about immigration, but if you really are suggesting that because the character is not white, there can be no white symbolism, you are truly delusional, in my opinion.
Maybe it was customary for the Japanese to wear pantyhose at all times.
Personally, you just have to do it now. Don't plan to wash the bathroom tomorrow, do it literally right now.  For more long term goals, rigidity is the key. Motivation is fleeting, repetition is not. Want to start running? You run every day. Every single day. No matter the weather, what you have to do. Every day. Want to lose weight? Cut out your problem foods entirely. Literally zero. It is what helps me with my goals, usually.
I thought Anivia and Zilean were immortal as well. Maybe if Brand, if I remember correctly. Were the lores changed hat much, or am I mistaken entirely?
Do you have any evidence for that? People seem to state it all the time, but with not real evidence. The only evidence I have really heard is a mod saying that gold was rather stable compared to what users thought.
Little known fact: primitive lanterns, such as the one exhibited here, were powered by noise! Yep, we used to have whole factories devoted to mean shouting into containers, just to keep the lights on!
Most quickly that it exits, which I would say is the point of saying gold is entering the game. Inflation only occurs when it enters faster than it leaves.\n\nYes gold enters the game, but that only matters in relation to how fast it leaves, and so if you can't provide evidence that it is entering faster than it leaves, then the point is moot.
In contrast, I am reading Lolita right now, in which he does describe 11-13 as prime, but the main character is also an abusive pedophile, so maybe we shouldn't listen to him.

What if Auschwitz was just supposed to be a place for the Jews to party, and it ended horribly wrong? This brings so many questions to light...
What are you talking about. They are suggesting that the difference is not necessarily due having more rapes, but perhaps the definition is different. You are not comparing two places with identical laws, so comparing the out come of two different law systems, with different metrics, can be dubious at times.
A: its a class card, helps to define an identity in that class through strength and use.\n\nB: It is far more situational than most other card engines, often requiring 3-4 cards to set up effectively, while there is also a board with multiple minions.\n\nThat being said, being a 1/2 wouldn't really effect it at all, really. It can hardly be played for board presence these days, with so many weapons and 3/2s early on.

Doctors will prescribe whatever makes them money from pharmaceutical sales.  Ten years ago I went to see a Doctor about some allergies I was having.

As the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a predecessor to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Anslinger institutionalized his belief that pot’s “effect on the degenerate races” made its prohibition a top priority. Here are just a few of his most famous (and most racist) quotes:\n\n* “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.”\n\n* “Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.”\n\nBetween Anslinger’s ruminations on the need to keep marijuana away from minorities — especially the entertainers! — were countless other fabrications about the health effects of pot. It was “more dangerous than heroin or cocaine” and “leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing,’’ he claimed.

The Paul VI Audience Hall (Italian: Aula Paolo VI) is a building in Rome named for Pope Paul VI with a seating capacity of 6,300, designed in reinforced concrete by the Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi and completed in 1971. It lies partially in the Vatican City but mostly in Italy: the Italian part of the building is treated as an extraterritorial area of the Holy See and is used by the Pope as an alternative to Saint Peter's Square when conducting his Wednesday morning General Audience. It is dominated by an 800-quintal (8 metric ton) bronze/copper-alloy sculpture by Pericle Fazzini entitled La Resurrezione (Italian for "The Resurrection").

This reminds me of my first Network Engineer job at Comcast.  They started me at $14.25 an hour.  After about 6 months of slave sweat shop call center craziness, I started to look around the room.  Dude sitting next to me was all psyched because he was there 4 years and just got a pay raise.  How much was the raise? 25 cents.  25 fucking cent pay raise for a whole year of sweat shop.  He was now making a whole dollar an hour more than me after 4 years.  Fuck that.\n\nApplied to a managed services company with a bunch of data centers after 6 months of working at Comcast.  Was hired on at $25.00 per hour.  Now am salaried at over 77k.  All those dudes are still at still working at Comcast making only $16.25 after 8 fucking years.  \n\nI guess my point is that people need to not sell them selves short and just accept whatever measly pay that is thrown at them.  Don't stagnate in the same environment.  Look around and see what better opportunities are out there for you.  Companies like Comcast prey on people who are happy with only 25 cents extra a year.

The nuclear explosion part is kinda weird and specific.
Maybe we are looking at this wrong.  If the secret to the universe is somehow attributed to light/photon/fire itself, then it could be clue to the nature how the universe is built.  \n\nLast time I checked, holograms are comprised of photons.  Maybe the pyramids being linked to light is a sign that the universe really is a giant holographic simulation.  Leaving icons of photons, unfolded pyramids, on the approximate speed of light location on earth seems like a clue from the creators of the simulation.
This is a really good angle.  Looks like cascading explosions downward.  Whats with the dude in the foreground?  He seems psyched.

Good for her. 
My wife has tried the grey rocking method to no avail.  Her mom will go to great lengths to spend time with her daughter, but it's all misguided.  Every vacation, shopping trip, dinner or lunch out, etc is just the same thing.  Her mom talks at her for like 3 hours about her life.  When my wife tries to add something to the conversation, she gets shushed and quieted.  Her whole life is like that with Nmom.  My wife will repeatedly try to add things about her life that's going on, but gets tuned out until her mom is done talking about herself.  \n\nLast year, my wife had to go to the ER to get an MRI for a cyst on one of her ovaries.  She is fine now, but her Nmom was totally disconnected from the whole situation.  Never asked her why she was in the ER.  Nmom knew she got an MRI, but never asked what it was for or if she was ok.  That's her mom in a nutshell.\n\nHer next step is corner her dad without her mom there to ask him questions.  We figure if he doesn't know what she had specifically and what stage she is in, then it's a farce.
With the amount of files Plex throws into the DB, this is a horrible idea.  Using the SSD for a large (lets say 10K+ files) media collection will wear level it quite rapidly.
Does this mean BBC iTV will start working in the US?
The problem is that in the US they are intentionally **above** horizontal.\n\nIn Europe they are required to be below, and highway signs have their own illumination.  In the US, headlights are required to cover 15 degrees above horizontal to illuminate signs over the highway.  When combined with HIDs designed for Europe this is a disaster.
Do *NOT* use RAID, **ESPECIALLY RAID0**.\n\nTypical stripe size for conventional raid is ~64KB.  This means for files larger than 64KB, both/all drives in the array need to seek to where the file is instead of just 1, so you end up waiting for the slowest one.  RAID1 (mirroring), sure the writes are slower, but on the reads you end up waiting for the fastest drive to spin to the file.\n\nFor an HTPC, you're typically dealing with large files, and will get better performance if each drive is only dealing with a fraction of them, rather than every drive needing to find every file.  There are various **UNraids** that are far better suited to this.\n\nPersonally I use Stablebit Drivepool, with my pool currently consisting of 2x HGST 8TB and 4x WD Red 4TB drives.  The way this works is each drive in the pool is formatted as a normal NTFS drive that can be mounted in another system without DrivePool installed.  In each of those drives is a hidden directory named "PoolPart.<volume guid>".  In that directory is a subset of the files on the big pooled volume that apps use, with the same directory structure.  By default, every file is placed on 2 drives within the pool, but you can change this and even adjust it on a per-directory basis.  It is smart enough to stripe the reads only if both drives a file is being read from are otherwise idle.  Performance-wise, 90% of the pool usage feels like an SSD.  The exception is when viewing a large (thousands of files at top level) directory in explorer, that directory must be read completely on all drives to be sure all files are listed, so this can take a while.\n\nThere are plenty of other similar products:\n\n\n**DrivePool** (https://stablebit.com/DrivePool) - what I use, Windows only.  What it presents to the system is the closest to a normal NTFS filesystem with the same support for ACLs, compression, encryption, sparse files, etc as a normal local filesystem, so it has the best compatibility for various Windows apps.  Some of the others don't work as a WMC recording drive, so to use them for that you'd have to record to another filesystem and have a separate process to periodically move stuff.\n\n**FlexRAID** - ( http://www.flexraid.com/ ) each drive in the pool has a normal filesystem mountable elsewhere like DrivePool, but instead of mirroring files to other drives, there are some drive(s) used for parity.  Performance isn't as good as mirroring, and no per-directory configuration, but still beats the crap out of conventional RAID and far more space efficient. In order to get closer to the performance of mirrored unraids like drivepool, it supports the parity volume having "snapshot parity" rather than real-time parity.  So if a drive dies in this mode, only the files written since the last snapshot (which is automatic and frequent) are at risk. Cross platform.\n\n**unRAID** - ( https://lime-technology.com/what-is-unraid/ ) - Uses a parity volume similar to FlexRAID, Linux only.\n\n**SnapRAID** - ( http://www.snapraid.it/ ) - cross platform, open source.\n\n**DriveBender** - ( http://www.division-m.com/drivebender/ ) - most similar to DrivePool, also Windows only, no longer under active development.\n\n**ZFS** - **NOT** otherwise mountable filesystems like the ones above, but extremely popular in Linux and has many other unique features like volumes spanning across multiple servers instead of just multiple drives (and redundancy between different machines).  Linux only, high memory use.\n\n\nAll of the above are more flexible than conventional RAID when it comes time to add more drives to the pool (or when it comes time to fix the redundancy when a drive dies, even without you swapping in a new one if there is enough space).  They should also pretty much all give you far better performance than a traditional RAID array.\n\n 
I doubt the DOCSIS3 would be interfering with the TV signal or we'd hear a lot more people with similar issues.\n\nTake a look at your channel map here: http://192.168.200.1/view_channel_map.cgi?page=0\n(Note: this map will not include SDV channels).\n\nAre the channels with EIA numbers 50.###, 51.### among the problem channels?  The default MoCA channel is around the 3rd harmonic of that so if that is the issue those channels should be among the more affected.\n\nEdit: Just realized from the tuner page link you sent earlier, that is one of your 51.### channels.  Definitely pointing to MoCA interference.\n\nAlso, while DOCSIS3 would likely not **directly** be causing the interference as it isn't sent at the higher power level that MoCA is, it is planned for the future to use the same frequency range as MoCA.  Most current implementations don't because existing amps & other equipment don't cover that range.  **But** they may have removed any low-pass filter where the cable enters your house with plans to use those higher frequencies for more DOCSIS3 bandwidth in the future, as that would block it, thereby allowing the MoCA signals through.  (And yeah, you're right, 500Mbps would be a pretty big chunk of the cable bandwidth to not expand into the new range, so they may be doing it already).\n\nWhich means the cable modem needs to not be behind the filter, but the TV tuners need to be behind it.\n\nMy guess is that they should be able to detect it.  And that it would be interfering with 500Mbps users.
I would put the odds of this being a false flag above 95%.
They are **required** to give the first one free.   Usually that is handled by claiming the first one is in your rented set top box.
49 I think would likely also be affected.  I guess it's possible the cable company multi-room DVRs could use it but then they should also have the filter built in so it would only affect your own tuner.  The FiOS ones use it for on-demand, caller-ID on TV, and remote DVR functionality, and the guide download, not just multi-room.  TiVos also use can use it instead of ethernet.\n\nI've been using an InfiniTV since it came out (and QAM tuners before that), it took sooo many calls to get TWC to pair it properly, and get the multiple tuning adapters that were required for the crappy SDV at the time.  I've since moved to an area that has FiOS which uses MoCA, and got the interference before getting the filter that Ceton was recommending for all FiOS users at the time.  \n\nThe 14- and 18- channels I don't think that would be the cause though.  I've had the problems on the low end like that when a cable wasn't screwed in tight enough.
Yes
Hardware transcoding should be **a lot better quality** than what your CPU can do with **real-time** software trancoding.\n\nIt's not as good as you could do with a slow software transcode to make an optimized copy for later playback, but I doubt 99% of the population could tell the difference.
I've seen worse.  For example, a "forgot my password" link that takes you to a form asking what you want to change your password to.  For a 401K.  Only numerical digits allowed, no letters.
I think in this case they are actually previous bites.  Watch the mark the new bite leaves.
> How did Clinton win the primary there.\n\nI'm pretty confident she cheated.
While the -7.5dBm is within the 15dBm range, it's still rather weak, and you should probably add a second amp or use a larger one.  Combined with the likely low SNR from being split so many ways it could be problematic.  This amp might be better suited: https://www.amazon.com/LABS-6001-Prograde-Bi-Directional-Amplifier/dp/B000BLEMHU/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1487016840&sr=8-4-fkmr1&keywords=18dB+cable+amplifier+1GHz\n\nMaybe also cap any unused outlets with these to reduce the noise they pick up: https://www.amazon.com/Type-75-Ohm-Terminator-Pack/dp/B000AAN76Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487016616&sr=8-1&keywords=f+terminator\n\nThe MoCA interference would be from your neighbors.  The filter I linked to place in front of the amp should get rid of it: https://www.amazon.com/2-Pack-Extreme-POE-F201C-Point-Filter/dp/B01FT8C5DW/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1487016338&sr=8-5&keywords=moca+filter\n\nMost of the more meaningful info about the SNR and the frequency being used is on the status tab, not the tuner tab shown in your link.\n\n\n\n\n
Since it was C-SPAN, nobody was watching to notice it.
If TiVo had an option to pull guide data from 3rd party sources such as SD, it would become my preferred alternative.\n\nBut with them having been bought by Rovi, who the WMC built-in guide switched to a year earlier, I am extremely wary.  WMC users have been without guide updates **many** times since the move from zap2it to Rovi in 2014.  Even when the Rovi guide is "working", the data quality is terrible, so most WMC users are now paying an annual fee to replace their guide data with a SchedulesDirect feed using EPG123.  Tivo you don't have that replacement option **yet**, so it seems dangerous.  And seeing as they were bought by the crappy guide data provider, it seems unlikely the option to get the old data back will become available.
Wow what a terrible wikipedia article.  Only really talks about or even mentions specific amphetamines, not any actual nootropics (which mostly improve mental ability, especially memory, by improving blood flow, not by being stimulants).  There have been many books about these since the '80s.  Things like ginkgo biloba and ginseng which you can get OTC, with gingko being known more for the memory enhancement (ginseng being known more for a weaker Viagra like effect).

MPEG-2 HDTV over WiFi is a no-go.  Things like Netflix can get away with it for 2 reasons:\n\n1) 3Mbps H.264 vs. ~15Mbps needed for the same quality MPEG-2 from cable, with no option for a lower bitrate stream.\n\n2) Internet streaming services buffer ahead of what you are watching, *usually by 30s or more*, so if your WiFi goes away for a second or two (which happens **all the time**...), it can be playing out of the already downloaded buffer during that time.  WMC buffering time defaults to **100 ms**.  You can raise this in the registry but not by much.  The reason they keep the buffer so tiny is because a bigger buffer would make it take longer to switch channels watching live TV.\n\nYou have a few realistic options:\n\n1. MoCA.  (Ethernet over coax) Unlike Powerline, these things are actually good, and actually deliver the rated total bandwith they are advertised with! (but exactly half that between any two nodes)  The FiOS router is in fact a dual band MoCA adapter, and their default installation uses one MoCA channel for the WAN connection from the router to the ONT and another for the LAN to talk to set top boxes.  It adds 4ms latency, but that is still way better than WiFi.  In the past year or so, MoCA 2.0 adapters have become available to give it 600Mbps bandwidth, but do not get the offbrands of these -- they are still buggy and need to be rebooted every day or two.  Off-brand is OK for MoCA 1.0 as that is far more mature.  ActionTec MoCA 2.0 adapters are here: https://www.amazon.com/Actiontec-Bonded-Ethernet-Adapter-ECB6200K02/dp/B013J7O3X0/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1486960250&sr=1-3&keywords=moca+adapter\n\n2. Configure Windows to act like a router, with the HDHR behind that router with Internet Connection Sharing: http://www.home-network-help.com/windows-7-internet-connection-sharing.html\n\nNote: the MoCA signal is much stronger than the cable TV signal, and even though it operates in a higher frequency range, the periodic scans for other MoCA devices will interfere with cable channels near harmonics of the MoCA frequency.  If your neighbors are using it, that may actually account for the kind of signal loss you are seeing.  You will need to put a MoCA filter in front of the cable tuner to block the interference.  MoCA filters: https://www.amazon.com/2-Pack-Extreme-POE-F201C-Point-Filter/dp/B01FT8C5DW/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1486960793&sr=1-4&keywords=moca+filter -- Note: there are other filters listed on Amazon.  I picked these out because it lists a larger stopband frequency which includes the MoCA 2.0 range, not just the primary 2 channels for MoCA 1.0.  Oddly none of the ones currently on Amazon blocks the 1GHz used by FiOS WAN, but maybe this is OK because the WAN band wouldn't have the higher amplitude pings searching for new devices on the network.  Most cable company STBs have these filters built in, while the InfiniTV and HDHR do not.  The cable company is supposed to put a filter like this where the cable enters your house to isolate your signal from the neighbors for stuff like this, but might likely not.\n\n
v2 still doesn't support CableCARD as far as I can tell.\nIs development still happening on v1 now that there is a v2?\nSupport of SchedulesDirect guide data without having to convert it to XML is a big disadvantage vs. NPVR or MythTV also.

It has the option, but it doesn't work as it should.  I can stream 15Mbps MPEG2 wtv recordings to the Roku with Emby, without any transcoding.  In Plex, even with the quality explicitly set to "original", it insists on pegging 6 logical cores transcoding it.
If only that were true.  Plex transcodes a lot of files that it doesn't have to, even with it explicitly set to "Original" quality. And it's rather sad that the non paid version won't use Quick sync for that yet.
Jail is too good for that demon.
The problem with this philosophy is that Windows update itself has become malware, especially if you downgraded to Windows 10.
The one thing you will need to do after migrating to EPG123 is to recreate all your scheduled recordings.  The series IDs in the SchedulesDirect won't match the Rovi ones and there is no easy way to map them.\n\nDepending on which way you go about setting up EPG123 you might keep your series scheduled to record, but they won't really record with the wrong IDs, so you'll have to re-add all the ones you can that start within the next 21 days of guide data so you can find them.\n\nI would recommend creating a backup of your recording schedule with the MCE Reset Toolbox.  The backups are in XML format with readable series names which you can read in a text editor to go through and create the recordings after updating your guide.\n\nYou won't regret it. The SD data is SOOOO much better.
Lately all the antivirus packages have gone to shit, either causing periodic system freezes or problems connecting to Media center extenders.   Tried avast, Avira, Malwarebytes, ESET, and finally now seem to be OK the past couple months using BitDefender.\n\nMSSE is also OK in terms of not breaking things (with exception #1 below), however:\n\n1.  In MS push to kill off media center, it started flagging related tools as malware, which is complete crap. \n\n2.  MS themselves said back in 2011 or 2012 that the reason everything MSSE searches for is made public is that it is intended to be a **minimum** amount of protection, and that all other AVs were supposed to use what they published and block a superset of what it does.
They've been talking about "replacing" it since less than 2 years after its introduction.  Complete BS.
I use one of these for external backup, and it may suit your needs: \nhttp://www.vantecusa.com/en/product/view_detail/488\n\nIt says in the specs it supports 3TB per drive but I've put 8TB drives in there without issue. \n\n
Our office goes the extra mile of installing the 1 ply backwards so that it rips when you are trying to pull it.  And has hair-trigger auto-flush toilets that will go off 50 times before you start wiping.

400Hz is very easy to see flicker.  The reason you don't usually is it takes longer than that for the image to fade, so it never actually goes black.  If you were to have shutters opening and closing in front of the image at 400Hz (aka active 3D) it would be very obvious

The latest public release.  Don't have plex pass for the beta.
Cable labs has an expensive and long drawn out approval process for allowing new types of DRM schemes for the storage and playback, and so far all that has gone through it, since the introduction in 2006 is TiVo, WMDRM (media center), and DTCP (dlna extension used by silicon dust and PS4, not much if anything else has implemented it yet).
Your SNR is actually good.  29-30 = barely usable, 33-35 = typical, 37-39 = FiOS, never seen it on cable.  I think the minimum theoretical usable for most qam256 cable channels is 27, but 29 or 30 you'll still get glitches.  Keep in mind this is log scale and every ~3dB increase is roughly doubling the ratio.\n\nSo it probably is MoCA interference.  You **can** use multiple amplifiers in line with each other, or put splitters after the amp. The amps with 4 outputs I haven't seen a 20dB boost like that at a reasonable price.  Typically a 4 output amp would have a 7dB boost to compensate for the loss from being split 4 ways.
There's no reason for 1000 thumbnails to be in 1000 files.  That means 1000 random disk accesses to read them all, which is a minimum of about 10 seconds wasted vs having them in a single file.
There is a setting for how much space to reserve for recordings, are you sure that isn't the limit being hit?\n\nOne other possibility, which I've only run into twice, in 12 years of WMC use:\nThe DB keeps track of the history of every recording you've ever made/attempted.  Eventually this DB can get corrupted or full.  It takes **A LOT** of entries in the recording history before this happens, I'd say probably at least in the 10K range.  Clearing the history may fix this.  (go to history under the Scheduled Recordings view and the option will be there).  You won't lose your recordings by clearing the history, however, it **will** forget which episodes of each series you've already recorded and start recording them a second time.

With TWC, just about everything but OTAs is copy protected, and can only be viewed/streamed by Windows Media Center. \n\nWMC streaming to Xbox 360s is your **only** option.  \n\nThat said, this is also the best option for UI and remote use, even if you didn't have any protected channels.  Nothing else comes close.  But the streaming to the XBOX 360 is **LAN ONLY**, so for outside your house you are out of luck.

The major roadways like the southern state, wantagh expressway, and sunrise highway weren't done until the next day.   And I'm not sure the county/state even did that... I saw residents out shoveling sunrise highway instead of plows. The ones ToH is responsible for weren't done **at all**.   We went out to Hicksville for lunch and the difference in the roads crossing from Hempstead to Oyster Bay jurisdiction was pretty clear.
Transcoding is how to **lose** quality, so that rules out Plex.
Does code need to be compiled to use .NET 4.6.2 (or at least 4.5) to take advantage of this change, or will ALL .NET binaries, even .NET 2.0 stuff like Win7 Media Center take advantage of this if .NET 4.6.2 is installed?
Depends how hard it is to split your coax wiring into two sections, one for DOCSIS3, the other for MoCA.  If that would require new wiring, you may as well wire real Ethernet.  If it wasn't for the likely interference with DOCSIS3 I'd say go for it, unlike wifi or powerline, it's actually reliable enough to stream HD to multiple Xbox media center extenders simultaneously.
yep.  In fact, part of the WMDRM requirements is your network latency must be under 7ms, which it won't be when placeshifting.
Exactly.  His move to move the embassy to Jerusalem and make it the capital serves no purpose other than to start trouble and pisses me off.  
not sure.  From some forum posts I found I think maybe they use it for multi-room DVR.
Didn't he say that his source would lose anonymity if this happened?
I used to have constant severe congestion and as a result constant sinus infections.   Stopped going to doctors for it as there was no point.  NAC pretty much completely fixed that.
Upgrade it back to win7.   BTW, DLNA streaming (what you were doing with the Blu-ray player) is **NOT** the interface to use.   You get same UI as media center on the desktop using an Xbox 360 extender.   A million times better.   But win10 will break that too.
Very limited on both what can play it back and what can record it, and to call the HDHR DVR solution alpha is a big understatement.  There has been progress towards that direction though, so hopefully by the end of the year it will be more viable.
The entire point of RAID0 is a maximized storage capacity.  Higher **SEQUENTIAL** performance is gravy.  But for everything other than sequential (basically every use case other than sequential benchmarks, aka the real world), it is slower.\n\nLets say you are reading a 250KB file (which I'd bet you'll find is larger than the average file size on your drive -- there are at a minimum tens of thousands of small files for the OS and other apps that you don't normally think about)..   We'll assume fast 7200RPM drives with 3-6ms seek time (average 4.5ms):  This gives a possible access time range of 3-12.8ms, average 8.65ms.\n\n1. No RAID: Single drive seeks to right location in a total of 8.65ms, reads 250KB (1ms).  Total: 9.65ms.\n\n2. 4 drive RAID0.   The 4 drives take different times in the 3-12.8ms range to seek.  Lets say one takes 4.65ms, one takes 7.65, one takes 9.65, and one takes 12.65.  Average is still 8.65ms.\n\nAfter the slowest drive spends 12.65ms seeking it reads its 64KB portion in 0.25ms instead of 1ms.  But the total is still 12.65ms + 0.25ms = 12.9ms.  Still 3.35ms slower than the single drive.
I work in NYC, at a place that is near 100% Democrat.\n\nPretty much everyone voted for Bernie in the primary.  I've met only two who went for Clinton.
With Clinton multiple wars would be a **100% certainty**.  So yes.
For a **real-time** transcode, **DRAMATICALLY better**.  For an offline transcode producing an optimized version of the video for later playback, software can be configured to do a higher quality transcode , taking much more time to do so.\n\nI find what QuickSync can do on my Haswell i7 to be roughly equivalent quality-wise to the "slow" speed setting for x264 in Handbrake, but about 10x faster.  Doing a software x264 encode on the "very slow" setting will produce better quality for the same bitrate, but it'll take ~40x longer.
So you should be able to use MoCA, with filters blocking it from leaving the non-modem side of your splitter and other filter(s) blocking it from getting to your TV tuners.  Even 1.0 will get you a reliable ~75Mbps between nodes, ~150Mbps total.   1.1 adds latency to get more bandwidth, which makes it not as good for WMC. (and can spike above DRM limits to prevent you streaming outside your LAN)  2.0 brings it to 600Mbps and fixes the latency.
None of the alternatives are anywhere near as wife friendly as Windows Media center.   I guarantee you I also have better remotes for it than you are using for the Amazon fire or shield.
You can plug it directly into the PC.  Once you enable the connection sharing.  Windows will provide a DHCP response to the port being shared to.  Check that something has actually gone wrong with the InfiniTV though.  Is it every channel or only certain channels?  If it's only certain channels you likely have either interference from neighbor's MoCA that can be blocked with a filter or possibly a loose connection. (The coax can act as an antenna screwing up some of the lower frequencies when the connections aren't screwed in enough).
2) http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer
Yes, most of your problem can be solved with a filter in front of the amp, as long as your cable modem isn't needing that higher frequency signal, or isn't behind the amp.\n\nEquipment cost for MoCA will vary greatly depending on whether you are looking to do 1.0 or 2.0.  FiOS routers are bought not rented.  When people upgrade to 100+Mbps FiOS internet the older MoCA 1.0 routers can't handle this, and end up on eBay for $25 each.  The router can be reconfigured to act as a MoCA bridge.  You'll need at least two of them, likely more depending on how many places you are extending your network to with them.\n\nThe 2.0 adapters are all at least $75 each for now.  \n\n
People still use optical disks?\n\nIf people ever give us DVDs or Blurays I just rip them to the PC, rather than ever playing from a standalone player or console.  
It's been about 5 years since I looked at Myth.  At the time it didn't support CableCARD tuners yet and was a big pain to set up.  From some quick searches this seems to have improved over time, I might give it another shot.
199 would not be near the record.  I was at UCF when they had higher than that with literally watermelon sized hail in April 1992.

Both ends are normal coax connectors, opposite genders.  So yeah, that is just a plastic cover on one end.

For 95% of the files accessed on a typical PC, the time to read the file is negligible compared to the seek/access time.  Yes, its much better for large media files, but not everything else.\n\n2 things to consider: 1. The "seek" time advertised by HDD manufacturers is the time for the heads to move to the right track, and does **NOT** include the time for the disk to rotate so that the head is above the desired sector on that track.   5400 RPM = 90 rotations/sec = 11.1ms per rotation, which is above the time any manufacturer would tell you.  Even @ 7200RPM, each rotation takes 8.33ms, and you have to add this to the seek time.\n\nMy new 8TB drives range get up to 250MB/s on the outer tracks.  Thats 208.3MB per rotation.  So half that, 104MB, is going to be difference between a random drive spinning to that point and all the drives in your RAID0 getting there, not even taking into account the seek part of the access.  For any read smaller than about half of that  that, the time for the slowest drive to find where it needs to be is going to be more than the time for a single drive to do the whole read.\n\nFor the vast majority of use cases, in order of performance:\n\nVarious UNraids mentioned > RAID1 >> single drive >> RAID5 > RAID0.   RAID0 is the slowest configuration, followed closely by RAID5.
Netflix on Xbox extenders.   Yeah, it's sad they had silver light plugin support even on extenders without leaving the WMC interface in the win7 beta, which included a Netflix plugin, but got rid of that support in the final release and have only removed more features since.
Plex scan of my library takes hours to pick up new files, even with it set to be notified of directory changes rather than poll.  The DB it creates also has an absolutely ridiculous # of files (before I disabled the local media assets agent for music albums it was creating roughly ~200 files per MP3).\n\nUnlike others, I've found Plex to be pretty damn unstable if I try to add all my media to it. It's also somewhat picky about the file types in each collection and tends to miss a lot of them. Like you I see it frequently freeze while indexing.  It will also disconnect every half hour or so when streaming.  Emby streaming from the same server to my Roku sticks is rock solid.\n\nEmby picks up the new files immediately, is far better about only transcoding what actually needs to be, and if it does need to transcode, it's QuickSync accelerated for free.  I've found both Emby and WMC to both be far more stable and more scalable than Plex.\n\nIt's not your system.  I'm running on a Haswell i7 with 16GB DDR3-2400 CL9, 512GB Neutron SSD boot drive, DrivePool'ed media volume consisting of 4x 4TB + 2x 8TB drives.   Plex scan of ~20K media files chokes more often than not.
I did some digging into the contents of the files.\n\nThe vast majority of them are not for videos at all, but for music.  It downloads every album image imaginable for each song, with a ridiculous average of over 200 images per mp3.  I have now turned off the "Local Media Assets" agent for Music albums.
Also because she's a Nazi.
Official denials?  I thought that was part of the official narrative.  Either way totally irrelevant -- why would they want to intercept planes the government was remote controlling?
20kHz is also audible.   There isn't really a sharp cutoff like that.  I can hear the horizontal refresh on most CRTs if not set to a much higher resolution/refresh than most people use. 200 to 400Hz would be in the range of normal speech, that's just silly.
The platforms aren't wide enough to get to full running speed.
You can use the MoCA for your LAN, but you will need the filters to keep it from interfering with your TV tuner, but it will be trickier if the cable company is starting to use the same spectrum for docsis3 to block the MoCA connection from getting to your cable modem without blocking the WAN connection.  
They make you check a box that says you paid for your UK TV license.
The long jump is done with a running start.  The platforms are about the same width as a train, not enough room to get enough momentum first.
It is still to this day not possible to get cable card support with the anniversary update.   \n
No.  Active only existed to rip people off getting the shit version of 3D before selling them passive sets where it was more usable.  Unlike active 3D, passive will give you neither flickering or ghosting.  Passive 3D 1920x1200 computer monitors have been below the $500 price point for well over 10 years now, since long before shitty active 3D televisions were introduced.  Active 3D for the computer was $99 in 1998.  Looks like they're a bit more delay between the 2 for TVs, and have stopped production of the active ones because when the passives hit the market in mass it will become immediately apparent that active is for suckers.\n\n
I think it's completely unreasonable to think he'd do worse on the east coast.  Or anywhere really.
I've been thinking about that lately....  I do currently record copy protected stuff.  But looking at **which** channels are copy protected on FiOS, it basically comes down to Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, and channels owned by Rupert Murdoch (FX, FoxNews, also Fox 5, but that one isn't copy protected since it is available OTA).\n\nAlll of these except for Cinemax have decent Roku apps, although the apps for Murdoch channels have as many or more annoying commercials as the cable feed and won't let you skip them.  And even Cinemax can be Miracast from my phone.\n\nPS... What do you mean "provisional" certification?  It got opened up to non-OEM PCs right around the time MS got rid of the eHome team that was maintaining it, back in 2009.
It doesn't get cold again. We've had 2 actual winters in the past 15 years.
yep.
Shaun King is a lying white man that pretends to be black.\n\nWhy believe anything that globalist says?
The Ceton web interface will tell you the signal levels to see if the amplifier is getting things to the right level.  You want as close to 0dBm as possible, outside +/- 15dBm range will have problems, if you have to choose + or - go +.  (but I would think that would be the first thing the cable installer measured).\n\nThe sudden change and it being only certain channels kind of points to MoCA interference which a low pass filter in front of your amplifier will block.  The amplifier you linked is unusual in that it lists a 3GHz range.  Normally < 1GHz is used for cable, 1-2GHz is used for MoCA & satellite, so that amplifier will be boosting any incoming MoCA signals, which are sent at a higher power level than the cable to begin with.\n\nThe other thing to watch out for if your amp is really that old -- Cable didn't used to go up to 850MHz.  A very old amp might only boost the < 500MHz range.  You need something like 50kHz-850kHz range.

If it's like the one I have, that side of the thing is threaded inside and you turn the whole thing to tighten it instead of having the screw piece.

Yes.
3 way split should in theory be -4.77dB if there is no other loss.  2 way split should theoretically be -3.01dB but are typically labelled -3.5. Not sure why the descrepancy, I guess there has to be some extra loss in splitting it, the -5.5dB listed seems reasonable.\n\n 
This is another possibility....\n\nI am hesitant to stop updating it, as my WMC PC is also the main PC for everyone in the house.  But I suppose I could stop using it for anything other than WMC and block Windows Update which to some degree has already become malware.\n\nBut besides the 2020 end of support for Win7 there is another concern.... I wouldn't be surprised if MS decides to brick the 360s at some point the way they have been going about things the past few years.
Linksys extender can still be used with win7, but you may need to point it to a bogus DNS server to avoid hanging on startup from Linksys's update server no longer being maintained.\n\nWin8 breaks all 3rd party extenders.  The 360 has always worked so much better than the Linksys though...

The states include: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia;and>Wisconsin>.
Trump has a history of this though. This account is an unverified account like the fake Flynn account.
I have to be honest. I had gotten beaten down (a little bit) over the last few days but Trump took an oxygen mask and some uppers and jammed them right into my heart and I am riding such a good MAGA high right now.
I agree with this.
Also I highly recommend George Webb's ongoing YouTube series. For new comers, start with Day 53.\n\nIt outlines everything that Trump is up against worldwide.
Knowing how Trump is, this is how it went.\n\nTrump: Good to see you Chris! Have you tried to meatloaf here? It's fantastic! (To person taking order) We will have two meatloafs please.\n\nNow that snake is mad he wasn't attorney general and wants to do his part to get his revenge.
You know the media has ZERO credibility when they can say that Trump sexually assaulted 11 women and no one believed them.\n\nIf that would have happened 20 years ago, he would have been done for.\n\nThe American people have realized the MSM is just lying propaganda.\n\nAll of them.
The best part of this is it is again Trump sticking to campaign promises. We are so used to politicians that lied to us that we are still shocked when someone that holds office does what they say will do.\n\nThis has really inspired me to run for office and I will in 5 years run for state representative in my state.
Bernie Sanders is out of touch with reality.
Wish there were fewer people on this planet with your mindset.
I mean obviously there is some sort of distro list media matters for America has to use.\n\nThat has to be the mailing list.
Yep. So far he is good on his claim is this is a huge discovery.\n\nNow we wait as see this huge televised announcement as it relates to the DOJ that will be massive national news according to him.\n\nIf it happens, he actually may be on the inside... If not, we know he is a LARPer. 
This is because law and order is absent from this country. This whiny generation who always got a participation trophy, have literally no respect or thought for anyone but themselves and their ideas.\n\nThey are animals. Rabid beasts. Plain and simple.
I totally get that, but why is one poll acceptable and the other isn't?\n\nEDIT: That is also a job poll and the other poll is overall.\n
Ah a troll account. Got it. Going to guess you are lying about following politics your whole life as well.
I appreciate a thoughtful response. \n\nI think it is very interesting that Jane Roe spent her life attempting to overturn Roe v. Wade. \n\nhttp://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas/2017/02/19/norma-mccorveys-journey-roe-v-wade-plaintiff-anti-abortion-activist-words
Well they forfeited their rights to guns. Try that here and I will kill 1000 migrants.
Love your city! Go get some bread pudding from Poogan's Porch for me and some Crispy Pig Ear Lettuce Wraps from Husk!!!\n\nNone of that garbage from Hyman's!
Why?
Lol. You people are so sad. At least you get paid to do it.
Ive noticed my speech pattern changing and even in my work emails started to sound like President Trump. \n\nI'm using it to red pill the libs on the west coast of our company. 
I'll have this discussion with you in PM's if necessary.\n\nI think and especially if you are newly "woke" then Alex has been demonized and set up as the face of fake news. Alex Jones has more credibility that all the MSM. Now does he say some things that may seen odd. Yep. Are we seeing things now that Alex has talked about for 1@ years? Yep.\n\nJust today he had Congressman Curt Weldon who was on the Cox Commission and announced he has evidence of Podesta, Clinton and Russia technology sales along with China.\n\nHe was backed up  by award winning journalist and author Dr. Jerome Corsi.\n\nI will admit if you haven't been listening to the man directly for a long time, it is hard to take him seriously as he has been demonized by the MSM.\n\nHope this helps.
Remember when they killed Eric Garner for selling illegal cigarettes?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner
No problem. Think about it this way. What makes more sense. If Alex was controlled opposition and a CIA man, why would they pull his Adroll account today? Why would the media character assassinate this man all the time? Why would the upcoming season of Homeland feature a right wing radio host with a southern accent that is supposedly inciting racism?\n\nIf he was a CIA plant, why would even Joe Rogan confirm that apple has suppressed the numbers the episode with Alex had?\n\nIf you are controlled opposition, you have to keep them relevant. Calling them fake news as opposed to alternative media is counter productive. \n\nJust try to listen to his podcasts and just fast forward to his interviews.\n\nSeymour Hersh and Jerome Corsi are ROCKSTAR journalists. Just today he had on a top congressman from the Clinton era saying that he has evidence the Clintons took money from Russia and he was on the Cox Commission and Armed Services Committee and he called Alex and true hero and patriot and was honored to be on his show.\n\nI will recommend you listen to Alex and if you haven't, start with the Episode 911 of the Joe Rogan Experience.
It was obvious it was a hit job. When Johnson was being asked the question, I had no idea what "El Lepo" was. I knew what Aleppo was but the way he said it sounded NOTHING like it is actually pronounced. 
Well Europe is fucked. Unless they start literally rounding up these migrants and sending them home it is all over. That is your only hope. It will take violence to stop the violence.
At this point, I am willing to entertain anything. The fact his grandfather was one of the only men to review Tesla's research after he was killed does make you at least ponder.
I think it is broken for everyone. However it broke right around the time we were supposed to trend the medialiesagain hashtag.
Just curious, what specific article can you point to from infowars that confirms them as bad or untrustworthy journalists?
Lol. Weldon is going to take down the Clintons. He has an award winning journalist working with him in Dr. Jerome Corsi.\n\nNumber 2. Is clearly satire making fun of SJW culture.\n\nNumber 3. Is there any doubt about this? They have feminist rallies with women chanting Allu Akbar and wearing Hijabs as a form of female empowerment. There is an Islamic invasion and it started 16 years ago. 
Can't think of the guys name but one guy was investigating the Clintons, went on a talk show and said if anything happens to me, please investigate the Clintons.\n\nJust a few months later on his birthday, he climbed to a remote area and shot himself in the head.\n\nPolice ruled it a suicide by a depressed man.\n\nSpez: here is the article. His name was Victor Thorne.\n\nhttps://conservativedailypost.com/breaking-journalist-investigating-clinton-scandal-found-dead-he-predicted-it-days-before/
Cooper who?
He is talking about Steven Sotloff. After tweeting about the rat lines in Syria he was killed by ISIS. Now that we know Obama and Clinton started ISIS with the help of the CIA (according to Tulsi Gabbard), clearly someone gave the order to silence him.\n
I think you can trust people like Seymour Hersh, Jerome Corsi. Those guys are about the only ones I truly am willing to suspend belief on due to their track record and then of course Wikileaks.
You may just not know, but those are actual police sketches from eye witnesses related to the kidnapping of Madeline McCann.
I highly advise against this.
Kinda off topic, but I interviewed Ben when he was on Oak Hill Academy and I can honestly say his was a nice kid but dumb as a box of rocks.
The fact that someone would believe this is real number being proposed. 100k individuals that do not have the training to go door to door rounding up illegals without some sort of specialized training.\n\nI don't mind if this happened, but this would not occur in Trump's first month as President.
Well get ready to read it in less than 48 hours. 
I saw a man in the ultra liberal town of Asheville, NC wearing a Trump shirt before the election and I told him I thank him for doing that... and then he calmly raised his shirt a bit and said I dare someone to attack me... while flashing a .45 on his hip.
The difference is you are a loser cuck and I am a winner.\n\nAlso, nice to finally make a comment that will\nget me banned from here.
What selective edits are you referring to?\n\nAlso, no. Rioting and attacking people in the streets is not "patriotic". That is the most asinine thing I believe I have ever heard.\n\nIf I was attacked like I have seen some supporters of Trump have been physically, well there would be dead people. Either they kill me before I retaliated and shot them or I shoot them dead.\n\nThis is no longer "politics". When you can't wear a hat that says Make America Great Again without fear of being attacked, there is something gravely wrong with that scenario.
Hell yeah. That even comes to that in the US, well there will just be lots of dead migrants. I don't care if anyone comes to the US if they will assimilate. If you come pushing Sharia and Islam as the only way of life and attacking those who don't share that opinion? Well you don't want to know how fast the US armed community would end those people.
They have no idea that we will kill anyone in the government involved with this.\n\nThis includes the good guys in the military and intelligence communities. It will never happen.
Trump yesterday: "You all are going to say I am unhinged, but I'm having good time".\n\nTapper: Say no more fam.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2JN9P62.png

Unless you are government or the compromised intelligence community, no you won't.\n\nI have no qualms with fellow civilians.
I would be floored if this was a real account. 
Link to the relevant FBI doc.\n\nhttps://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-06/view
Can we just talk about how ludicrous that mobilizing 100,000 national guard members to remove illegals even sounds?\n\nThe logistics of that would be incredibly daunting and they would also need training as well. Leaking stuff like this proves you are a moron to believe something like that.\n\nI hope they enjoy busting rocks for the next 20 years. 
I've never seen or heard of this. How terrifying.
Interesting. I talked to people from the Parks Services and they were adamant it was a gorget. Didn't know it was something that had contention.
So true! Forgot all about Trump's infrastructure plan! Build that bridge!
Then overthrow them?
I'll demand that everybody rewatch the game in case there were a few touchdowns I missed, then I'll find someone to punch in the nose.
I certainly don't disagree there. This is a pretty complex discussion, actually. I think that the leaks coming from the White House need to be addressed, and whoever the insider mole is needs to be ousted like yesterday.\n\nI wish General Flynn hadn't been put out so hastily because I think everyone deserves a chance to plead their case and make good, but I also think that his ouster has as much to do with lying to Pence as anything else; the President needs staff that he can trust in a crisis, and lying to one of your bosses when you're confronted about what may have been a simple moment of poor judgement does not inspire confidence.
I don't want to send the God Emperor or any of the Pences to prison.
Goodness. That's an unsettling photo.
Not 100%. My cat is a lying, thieving, murderous dick.
"And now, a question from Bulian Bassange from Baustralia."

What you took away was the intended effect. I was commenting on what they inadvertently revealed about themselves.
Well I mean, free speech can only go so far before you start offending people then you have to do. My demiqueer quadgender head mates are who make me special. Without them I'd go crazy.
She was also in a movie called "Beautiful Girls" at a very young age, serving the purpose of a love/lust object for a much older man. It wasn't a bad movie overall but those scenes made my skin crawl. It used the Humbert Humbert approach of making the pedophilia seem OK because she was  super precocious and oh-so-wise.
Age of consent is....... Oh silly girl, nobody cares about your consent!

Not for nothing, but the plant that used to make pipeline components in Braddock just sold...
That's how they started catching the imposters.
...The comic isn't about adults relying on other people. It's about systematically preventing children from growing into inquisitive, logically thinking adults.
During clinical trials for drugs, the people running the study have to list all the things that happen to study participants. Even if it's most likely unrelated. So if 500 people participate in a vaccine study, and one of them died, then death has to be listed as a possible side effect.
But he's also a mad dictator who won't listen to people smarter than him. And he's a 9/11 truther who bragged about benefiting from 9/11.
That's some we wuz kangz looking shit there.
No thanks. That will stay safely behind the NSFW screen.
You probably accidentally typed it that way at some point and it left it on your browser bar as a suggestion. Clear your history to fix it, but you'll lose all your suggestions.
 Have been hearing this rumor for years, as well as children being passed through crooked adoption agencies.\n\nAs well as the more run of the mill kidnappings. \n\nSadly, there are also a certain number of criminals who give birth and straight up sell their children.
Me too.
The cnn broadcast was awesome for how they kept zooming in on counties trying to find pockets of uncounted Hillary votes. Especially the moment Erie county went red.
Well I just figured out you meant A Tribe Called Quest. I didn't realize they were still around. Do they still do suck ass rap for white people who think they're woke AF?
 I have heard reference to something called the Bowling Green Massacre before. I used it as the name of a bar band in a story I was writing. I'm less distressed by her mistake than I am at not knowing what I could possibly have been thinking of.
You can see it in any major city here.\n\nBut whatever. Welfare for illegals and refugees is more important than ensuring our service members have homes and mental health care.
He self-funded his primary campaign. He said from the very beginning that once he secured the nomination he would accept GOP funding and donations and he had a campaign store just like everyone else would have. I don't remember DJT ever claiming he funded the whole campaign.\n\nEdit:I do remember at a certain point when the Republican Party was not backing him he said something to the effect of "You got me within a month of the election, I can carry afford to carry myself the rest of the way."  I don't think he meant to do it, I think he was just letting people like Priebus know that he wasn't going to drop out.
I love how Shia's stream has been getting used for everything except its intended purpose.\n\n#WasteHisTime2017

It showed me all right... It showed me that there is no longer any point in pretending the modern left deserves a seat at the table.
And without white producers hip hop would never have made it out of New York. I fail to see the point.\n\nI guess I don't qualify as white, or conservative. I hate country music.
Omg they really are that out of touch. Who in their right mind would vote for Anthony "Carlos Danger" Weiner now?
Because the antifa like to imagine they are overthrowing the white patriarchy. Gav gav is making it how wrong they are
You're cute for thinking that.
And somehow they vote Democrat consistently. I don't understand rust belt cities, the unions really  fuck with the residents' heads and convince them to vote against their own interest.
You don't meet a lot of based drama teachers. Good to know someone was looking out for you.
You just saved yourself a fake rape allegation, pal. Strong work.
I feel sorry for his wife if this is true. But you know what, he deserves it.
They have been playing for quite a few years now with greater continuity; the first few seasons were totally episodic, with maybe a bit of self reference if it was funny.\n\nThe last season there was a huge story arc meant to last a season and satirize the election. The story hinged on Clinton winning, and they had to also something together writing it essentially in real time. It didn't work out so well.\n\nNow they're hissy fitting their way out of making fun of politics.
I'm pretty sure that's what it sounded like outside the palace of Versailles an hour before it got stormed. Podesta the Molesta was one thin sheet of plate glass away from getting ripped apart alive.
Handwriting expert? Was the phrenologist unavailable?
She has to shut her mouth while men are talking. Haha.
It'll be kiddy porn, because Saul Alinsky teaches his followers to deflect attention by accusing your your enemies of the shit you're actually doing. And it's pretty unforgivable, so there's no laying low for five years then coming back.
When I was a teenage leftist, I was a pacifist socialist. Now I'm a "fascist" right wing shit lord and the left is taking violence to sickening levels.
Haha. This was the first time I've voted Republican since 2000.\n\nI like this, though. If they keep telling themselves these ridiculous stories, then they will forget to campaign effectively or nominate candidates who can actually win.
I have no idea what that acronym means. So... No triggering here.

Thanks a bunch, that makes sense.
Another one for the boycott list, 'pedes. I know I'll never by Balenciaga again.\n\nAlso I'm poor...
That's like saying that you consider all suspects guilty because they wouldn't have been arrested without evidence.\n\nGiven the scenario, can't you see that perhaps he was let go not because of anything he might have already done but rather to end this particular scandal ASAP and move on. Whether he did anything wrong or not, there is still a major trust issue at play not only from the public in regards to Flynn, but possibly also from the POTUS and vPOTUS due to Flynn's own response to being confronted.
It would be easier and more coherent to scrap the article and publish a new one, now with facts.\n\nOr just not lie to begin with.
And the one before him, and that guy's predecessor, and the guy before that.....

I think they're amusing, even the one where he's in the oval office coloring a picture with a sippy cup of milk at his side\n\nIt's a cute little meme, and culturally appropriating it feels right.
They might try, but then the globalists, leftists, and other -ists would have to defend pedophiles.
She's so fat and unattractive, they used her to portray a fat unattractive man. Take that Trumpets!
The choreography for this show is just ugly. Quite frankly I expected more from her.
I grew up with a mother who played Queen almost every day, I had memorized that song by the time I was 6. And it was always "my trigger."
>This has me thinking that the majority of participants are democrats but that there are some republicans involved as well\n\nAccording to Alex Jones, both parties are infiltrated by the scum but there was a purge of the Republicans so the Dems are like 90% gone, but GOP is about 30%.\n\nIt is Alex Jones, so consider the source, but I do think that this fits with what we're seeing.
True story. My aunt used to be slim. After 8 years in KY she was heavy and thought that regular Sprite was less fattening than Diet Pepsi because it's the caramel coloring that causes weight gain...
He really did that, though. The "aggressive" "misogynist" and "racist" part is wrong, but he did create the Yiannopoulis Privilege Grant.
Arrest them all for indecent exposure. They can no longer get real jobs due to being in the sex offender registry.

I was going to make an abortion joke here but I just can't. I have a toddler and I can't even bear for him to be sad because his milk cup is empty. The idea of her or anyone else hurting a child makes me want to do things with knives.
>[T]hey aren't like hey I'm going to put my military uniform to go beg for money.\n\nSome are fake, some actually are vets. If you can believe that some people would put on a surplus uniform to sell a lie, then it should stand to reason that a real veteran could put it on for panhandling as well.\n\n>There would be no point to it except to put it on to beg people for money.\n\nAnd that's exactly the point of doing it. When you're panhandling, your story is all you have unless you have a performance art and you can try busking. \n\nI'm not even sure why I responded to this. Whether or not a homeless vet would actually wear his old uniform is secondary to the important fact that we have tons of homeless veterans who need health care and mental help that they're not receiving.\n\nHell, we have tons of non-vets in the same boat.
SB makes me choke. It's so dark and burnt tasting, you lose all the subtle flavor notes that a coffee at that price point should have.
So what do you call this particular fetish? It can't be furry, no fur.\n\n\nChitonsexual? Clawplay? Do they give each other antenna jobs?
So... Senators refusing to discuss the content of a secret meeting possibly pertaining to national security counts as news now. That says more about the relationship between politicians and their favorite journalists than  about President Trump.
And her vote even counts as much as mine. Fuck me.
Not OP, but I don't know what you mean and I'd appreciate if you could elaborate. I'm not being sarcastic.
We're  losing weight in my house. Watching no TV, we spend almost no money on entertainment or dining out anymore either. Fuck Hollywood and passive amusements.\n\nI'm getting back into a process that will allow me to do what I truly want to do with my life, and my husband is assuming a more assertive leadership position at his job using tactics fron *The Art of the Deal.* \n\nBy watching the President's reaction to challenges we are learning to embrace the chance to become stronger rather than becoming angry or frustrated at setbacks.\n\nThe debacle of the election predictions had taught us to trust our own eyes, ears and instincts more than ever before.\n\nMaking America great again starts with making yourself great again.
I use Chrome and I've never had that happen, nor with Firefox when I used it.

It's what happens to young people who perpetually frown. The next step is jowls.
And we're better than that. The scary ones give me nightmares, but I've known many based Persians, Syrians and Lebanese who were Muslim but not Islamists. Let them pray, and live in peace. Christians do these sorts of group prayers all the time.
I'm pretty certain Pizzagate is real, or contains elements of truth so I want this to be true because I want the sick fucks brought to justice.\n\nOTOH, what I truly want is for Pizzagate to have no grounding in reality whatsoever. Given the existence of pedo rings in L.A. and other world governments, I'm not terribly optimistic about that one.
That looks like a pretty crowded train. What criminal mastermind got away with that with nobody noticing until every window was covered? And even then nobody noticed until OP had time to board?\n\nAlso, no actual neo-Nazi would draw a swastika like that. 
Very wrong. That's how you end up with Irish twins.
The poll wasn't finished yet, and the results had been much more favorable to his narrative just a couple of hours earlier.
Nobody seems to care about the fact that talk of killing the president is not protected as free speech.
You don't know that, and I don't know that. I never even mentioned this guy.\n\nAnd yeah, I would absolutely give him diapers and/or formula. Whatever he may be, no baby should go without.
.... Here, have a vote. I'm not sure yet which one.
The only point of the comic is that the establishment, the cabal, the powers that be, the shadow government or whatever else you want to call the overriding big-bad of your world, benefits directly from keeping people stupid and this process begins in childhood.
Of course it did. But children who are not taught to love logic and math generally don't grow into adults who choose to learn extra logic and math. Don't be obtuse for the sake of seeking an argument.
The black pill is hard to swallow, and more so if you haven't taken the red yet.\n\nYears ago I wouldn't have believed in Pizzagate either.
Why did that dishearten you? Shit people can still have one good idea in a lifetime.
Because the story is literally about the media and how the Senators are refusing to speak to them after this particular meeting. Truthfully, they should never be speaking to the media after meetings where secret information is discussed. The fact that the journalists are shocked at not being able to get a statement speaks volumes about the relationship between politicians and reporters. Namely, that some attention whoring legislators love to blab, and the media seem to expect it as their due.
I was raised on soy formula. The dairy kind made me incredibly ill as a baby. My grandfather was nursed on goat's milk.
The unwritten rule that all non leftist opinions must stay corralled in /r/The_Donald so that it's easier to silence.
I blame the media for people not knowing the truth and supporting wrong causes for the wrong reasons.  But people still made the conscious decision to become violent unprovoked.
We're all going to die someday. It's not wrong to hope for a good death.\n\nI've tended the dying many, many times in my career. I think that most people don't get this type of choice, this type of dignity.
Most do, at least a little. Even Ned Flanders has taps in his sweet basement.
Right on! Definitely take full advantage of this. I literally have music flowing through my head at work all day lol. I keep humming melodies and ideas into my voice recorder. 
Yet the DEA cracks down on the beautiful plant that is kratom. SMDH. A safe, unadulterated ground leaf that is cutting into their profits. 
I have a cousin who grew up spending every waking moment in front of a computer screen. When I'd go over there for a visit, he'd pop his head out and say hi, and go right back. I never once saw a friend of his there, ever and he never went outside or rode a bike. He was on the computer so much that he gave himself some sort of tick or CNS anomaly, that seemed like tourettes syndrome. It has since subsided with less screen time now. He has issues when he's forced to be in social situations. You can tell he misses social cues and can't flow with conversation. I fear the deeper we go into technology, the more the future generations will be like my cousin. \n\nIt's crazy when you're in a room full of people and everyone is glued to their phone! I'm guilty of this at times, but I make a conscious effort to enjoy the company im with nowadays. However, it's almost pointless since others are not doing the same. \n\nAs far as the ruling class, they've got everyone so indoctrinated, people barely get mad about anything that they should be. Why would they when they have Kim Kardashians twitter feed at their finger tips. But on the plus side, because everyone is spending more time online, more and more people are waking up to the TPTBs BS. 
This gave me a chill down my spine. 
They almost had it in October bro! It was done! But we reigned down on them hard and got it back. 
I agree. We're all skeptics searching for a shred of truth in an infinite haystack. Question everything and everyone. 
What did it say? Do I even want to know? Nah probably not lmao. 
My father in law spends every waking moment watching TV. You could say the indoctrination runs deep. What a pitiful existence. But it's hard for people to have the energy to do anything else when they're basically sick from all the chemicals in our food, water, and air. Fuck TV. I haven't watched anything since Breaking Bad! 
I have to keep a landline as well, for that exact same reason. I have the bare minimum on everything, cable, internet, landline, and one cell phone, and it's costing me about $300 per month. My wife still loves TV, otherwise cable would have been gone long ago. 
Don't forget the goblins! 
I recently had an order that was out for delivery for 4 business days. You could say I was pissed off! 
Wow, a CEO that isn't greedy AF?! Almost unheard of in this day and age. 
The fact that NASA never does a 360 degree rotation with the camera is suspect to me. If I was in space, I'd be moving that camera all over the place. \n\nNASA is probably just a front to siphon money from hard working taxpayers. 
There have definitely been numerous allegations of CIA drug running. It would be a hard thing to prove though. 
I agree with this, and think you should do all of the above, minus 4 of course haha. It covers every angle. Most importantly though, is number 2. You have to be assertive, and stand up for yourself and use tact while doing so. 
According to Roger Stone, he took signed out the files repeatedly. He was VERY interested in them. 
Yaaa happy bday! It's a special time for us, as there's an eclipse happening! 
Have you read any of the books he's recommended? I'm currently reading 'The Origin of Consciousness.....', and it's amazing. I will definitely be reading ALL of his recommendations. \n\nI've always been an extremely curious guy, so his threads make me really excited for the future, mainly so we can be let in on the secrets. He's basically told us we know jack shit and that our Overton window is tiny compared to what it could be. Fascinating. 
Or maybe amphetamines. 
Look through spez's comment history. So many gilded comments from all the asshole kissers. 
So you're buying the official 9/11 narrative? How much time have you spent researching building 7? Just curious. 
Great post op. This has been on my mind for quite awhile actually. One of my buddies and I have been discussing everything in your bullet points, and he actually bit the bullet and does all of the above. He's pretty much off the grid completely now. I would be too, but my wife is blissfully ignorant and enjoys the concrete jungle lol. \n\nI think alot of people are waking up, but I could be totally wrong since I'm always in this sub or YouTube. I was just watching a Nasa press conference and the comments section was 100% shit talking them for their fraud, so I have hope. Either way, in time everyone will be awake. Once the baby boomers are all gone probably. I don't think they could take or censor the net too much without a revolution. The cabal will probably just double down and be even more obvious imo. 
I like this visual representation. I feel like there's more tiers above the Rothschilds though. Direct descendants of Jesus, King David, etc. 
I scoffed at FE when I first heard of it. I didn't give it 1 single second of thought. Then one day when I was looking for an image of the earth, I could not find a single raw photo. This led me down a rabbit hole of me trying to disprove the FE, to which I could not do! \n\nI don't have all the answers, but I see deniers questions like "the stars blah blah blah", which tells me they don't understand the theory and are just like I was when I first heard about it. \n\nResearch for the truth with an open, logical mind, and do not scoff at those who are after the truth! We are all on the same side. 
Total horse shit.. No cloud movement at all. Pure CGI. 
Rogan is a sellout nowadays. Him and Schaub always harping on Edjy Brah for being a conspiracy theorist. 
Fluoride + aluminum makes it more absorbed into the body, therefore these 2 ingredients are in the most commonly used items, toothpaste and deodorant. I've been using a salt based deodorant and found it works just fine and lasts alot longer. 
Fascinating stuff here. The mind is a powerful thing. It's funny that I'm seeing this right after an ice bath after Jiu jitsu training. I feel like a major pussy, but will handle it better next time after seeing this. \n\nIf the mind can do this, what the heck else can it do?!  
,<-- Those too. 
For real. Normies think we're bat shit crazy already for questioning 9/11, so imagine what they'd say about telepathy. 
Television gives cancer to every single cell in my body. 
Agreed. When people gossip around me, I try to change the subject asap. There are better things to talk about than what so and so said or did. It shows they're lacking in the intellect department if you ask me! 
Are we ever. In my province, there's 2 options, and you can bet they're colluding with each other. The monthly rates are insane. 
I wonder what happens with that cocaine after? Maybe it goes into 'evidence' and then gets redistributed into the market. 
Yes, I agree. I read Stone's book about the Bush Family, and it was in there. Stone definitely had an agenda to fill when he wrote it, and that was to have Trump win the primary and take out "jeb!". 
Chew soap,  chew soap,  chew soap. 
Just checked it out, and ya pretty sketchy. But what's even worse is that video led me to another one of Nixon calling the astronauts on their first moon landing by way of landline lmao. What in the actual fuck?! 
I was just thinking about this the other day! It might be time for me to check out their lyrics,  to see if there's any clues there. 
Me too. So far we have FBIanon, CIAanon, and HLIanon. Are there any others? 
I literally had your exact thoughts today. Researching kratom is what brought me to reddit, but now I spend far too much time in /r/conspiracy. 
I love this post. Are you HLI from 4chan, by any chance? 
An anecdote that might tie in to this somehow, some friends of mine from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu were saying how their kids were natural grapplers. Their kids were basically able to strangle other kids with techniques that are completely unnatural to humans, without ever being taught. Jiu jitsu, wrestling, and judo are like physical languages. Once you know it, it's engrained into your DNA. Like riding a bike, once it's encoded into you, you can always do it. Well same with these martial arts. But it seems that the coding has been passed down to their children. I've heard at least half a dozen people say this. Fascinating. 
That poster has stated that he found that video on the deep web somewhere and that it was totally unrelated to the text in his post. 
Holy shit, 100,000 protestors and counting. 
So true about the food. I went to a northern Manitoba city, and saw milk being sold for $25 per 4 litre jug. Also the bank machines in the corner store charged $20 to take out money! \n\nThe healthcare is shit. My uncle pays a private company to help manage his health and it seems to be much better. \n\nThe roads in my city are detoriating. The city blames it on the climate, yet you head an hour south, into the US, you couldn't find a pot hole if you tried. We could be doing so much better. 
Now wash that down with about 50 grams of sugar and spike that insulin! 
The salt based one is the best that I've tried. You have to run it under water because it's dry and will not apply to the skin. Also, the thing lasts forever. When I was using aluminum deodorant, I was paying like $8 a stick and it would last like 2 weeks. The salt based one is the same price, but has lasted an entire month already. 
The name brand I use is Crystal, which I get from Shoppers Drug Mart. 
I've always thought dentists upsold cavities, so haven't been to the dentist in 15 years. I have nice, good teeth. I brush 2 to 3 times a day everyday and stay away from pop, candies, and sugar in general. Seems to have served me well, but who knows. 
What's the word out there? Is it water cooler talk? Or do ppl not even give AF? Seems like the UK is pretty strict. They banned all mind altering substances last year too, even nootropics. 
This guy is insane. It's one thing to point out evidence and facts, but it's another thing to poke the bear with a stick. The Clinton machine has piles of dead bodies behind them, I'm starting to think he could be another one soon.
I thought he meant clean, as in debt free. I could be wrong. 
Great post. This should be in a stickie in its own post for a few days. 
Hey fellow Winnipegger! Do you still use this vendor? I'm looking to try a new vendor out. I used to use Terrabotanical, but wasn't too happy with the last batch I got. 
Lmao 
Why do all these 'insiders' use 4chan? I don't frequent that place much because it seems to be 98% shit posting from what I've seen. 
Which is so ridiculous. Everyone knows alcohol is one of the worst, most potent drugs out there. It hits more neurotransmitters than most other drugs, has a wicked hangover, and makes otherwise good people, make some bad choices. \n\nWTF has weed ever done to anyone? It's not like people ever say "man I got so high yesterday, I picked a fight for no reason". \n\nFor me, weed forces me to deal with the uncomfortable things in life I don't want to deal with. So I really hope Sessions has a change of heart on his weed stance. 
Thanks for doing this OP. Hopefully he comes around again soon to continue answering questions. I feel like we're getting somewhere with them now. 
He seems to drive the space elevator idea pretty hard. I can't even fathom what is possible with this idea. It has truly smashed my Overton window into a thousand pieces haha. Honestly, it would be nice to get off this planet, or stay here and have the phsyco rulers of ours leave. \n\nAlso, I've looked at alot of Osama = Obama videos, and I'm convinced they're the same. Exact same facial structure minus a few differences. Differences that could easily be made by the CIA. 
Look at that reptilian face. 
That will be one heck of a birthday present for me tomorrow! Fingers crossed. 
Brought to you by stamps dot com. Dont you hate going to the post office, freak bitches?!
You seem to have a strong opinion on something you haven't done alot of research on, which isn't the way to go about it imo. Save your judgement when you have thoroughly examined evidence from both sides. If you don't know the details, how can you not buy into building 7 trutherism? \n\nLook into what was in Building 7 and look into what office of the pentagon was destroyed. It appears they killed about 1000 birds with a single false flag stone. 
Thanks OP, I love these. I don't think he's a LARP, seems really on point. 
I'll put it on my list. Thx. 
Hands down best description ever lmfao. 
This. Go enjoy nature, read some books, play an instrument, etc. Keep balance. I should heed this advice myself. 
If we take away their pedophilia, we take away their cheques and balances. They will have no way to trust each other if they can no longer have blackmail material over one another. 
I think we're in a prison planet. A hell, if you will. The world can be a very cruel place. We share earth with barbarians, who will kick the shit out of you for walking in their neighbourhood or for wearing a certain color of clothing. Bombs are dropped all over the world, blowing peoples legs off. \n\nThe climate is so cold in my part of the world, you can't have bare skin exposed for more than 60 seconds without getting frost bite. It's awful. \n\nWe also have empathy, which makes us hurt when others are hurt. So not only do we suffer ourselves, we suffer when others suffer too. \n\nIf all that is not bad enough, TPTB make our existence even worse by forcing us to be debt slaves. By making us sit through indoctrination school. Then working jobs we don't really like, but we have to work otherwise we're fucked. We dont really have free will, as the system is designed to make us need to be slaves. \n\nNow on the flipside, with all that suffering, we also get the opposite. We get to love and be loved. We can enjoy sex, music, food, drugs, life etc. We wouldn't appreciate the good without the bad, would we? Maybe we need contrast in this existence. 
HLI said that Bill Clinton planned 9/11 with Bush Senior to cover up the fake bonds they took out of a bank in New York. Clinton took the bonds out to buy off KGB members and politicians and this directly helped topple the Soviet Union. The expiration date of the bonds was fast approaching. \n\nEdit: Haven't read HLI in awhile either, so details may be a little off.
Admittedly, I'm jealous of young Jamie and his dream job. That would be an awesome gig. 
Lmao, all good man. Enjoy the book. It's pretty amazing. 
Can't believe people get off to this kind of useless bullshit. Talk about poisoning the fucking well. 
There's a link to a pdf of the book in the op.\n\n http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf
David Icke has been saying this for years, and I no longer think he's a nutter. I believe there's a major war being fought behind the scenes, I just hope we are FREE in this lifetime. The war on consciousness is the most important war imaginable. To me, it dwarfs every other conspiracy. \n\nThe guy from the high level insider threads was saying that our Overton window is tiny compared to what it should be, and that one of our limiters is the limitations we put on what could be. This is fascinating. Maybe heaven is in our minds, waiting for us to tap into it. 
I think the reason ppl think the earth is flat, is because you're supposed to be able to detect curvature at 15,000 feet. An amateur flat earther sent a balloon up to 120,000 feet and saw no curvature. They've also performed laser experiments, and also being able to see downtown Chicago from 60 miles away. Technically, Chicago should be out of view, under the curvature of the earth. \n\nBut the #1 reason that gets people interested in the first place, is that there's no unedited photos of the earth. They're all CGI or paintings. Like WTF? \n\nFrom what I've seen, FE's don't really have an agenda, they just truly believe the earth is flat. If the earth is really a globe, why are there no basic photos of the earth? 
Yes, until the TV says it, they won't believe it lmao. 
I can't even watch after reading this comment. Breaks my heart what these fuck heads have done.. Off with their heads! 
Why do the elites worship Lucifer? They have hidden knowledge, they know things we don't, and they're satanic. Much of the Bible has been redacted and molded to suit their agenda. What gives? 
A part of me thinks that HLI holds back a little bit. One thing I've noticed is that he seems to get deeper and deeper every question session. Now this could just be the conversation and questions evolving, but he did say that the public could not handle the truth all at once. If he came right out and said reptilians, he could possibly be written off as LARP, which is the last thing he wants, given how close his regime is to taking over. Just like if the earth was flat and he came out and said it, no one would pay attention. His conversation has definitely evolved to 'think of a better way to run the world', but it's hard to imagine a better way without full disclosure of the secrets they hold. That's what frustrates me the most. \n\nAs for Pieczenik, Trump, and Jones, I hope they are on the side of HLI and want to overthrow the old order, even though HLI said they're not on the same team. One can hope though. \n\nIn the end, there's so much information and so much going on, it's hard to discern what's real and what's not. I will definitely keep paying attention to all of the above though. 
I saw a few posters defending CNN in this sub a couple of days ago. The poster who was calling CNN fake news got down voted into oblivion. 
Very interesting. Commenting for later. 
When things start feeling normal is when you need to be even more cautious imo. Be smart op. 
Having it illegal is probably a way for the CIA to make and launder money off of the books. They can soak up piles of cash and do with it what they choose, out of the eyes of the public. 
Do you have evidence for this? Or is it a belief? 
It would be in his best interest to never fly ever again, or go to the gym. There's a foreseeable 'accident' in his near future. 
How do we deal with that? Maybe put a cap on how much wealth one can accumulate? Right now, it is essentially law of the jungle. Take what you can get and fuck everyone else. But maybe some of that wealth could be redistributed to the plebs, so that we can have a minimum living circumstance for everyone on earth. 
All of the photos of Earth are CGI, paintings, or heavily photoshopped. There isn't a single negative, unaltered photo of the earth. Also, people have sent up weather balloons to 121,000 Ft, with no fisheye camera lense, and no curvature is detected. 
This is all blowing my mind! I was an atheist up until a couple of months ago. 
I totally agree. We spend more than a decade being indoctrinated in school. Then the majority go out and work some shit job that we hate in a cubicle somewhere. In order to live a decent life on the average salary of $50,000 per year, people get in so much debt to keep up with the Jone's. School doesn't help the individual grow to their strengths, and the brightest people sit in a class that can only move fast enough for the slowest individual to keep up. \n\nI realized all of this a long time ago, so I started borrowing the elites money and using it to make money, in the form of rental properties. But I could care less about money. What I care about is having the time to do what I want. I wish this is what all of society could do. I wish we really had free will, rather than the illusion of free will. 
Freemasons, 9/11,and JFK. 
Yes, and someone needs to go AWOL and get some evidence of what's out there!
Very interesting! I will definitely give it a try. I never thought I'd say that ahah. 
Nah, more like Cheney, Bush Senior, and the Clintons, among other puppet masters. 
I'm in! This is a great idea. 
Forgiven. 
What is safe to eat nowadays? It seems I may have to move deep into the forrst and hunt/grow my own food. 
As a musician, I've noticed a massive spike in creativity this year. Seemingly out of nowhere the creative juices have been flowing. I've written more songs this month than I have in the past year. I've also read more books and I just generally feel better. It wouldn't shock me if this was tied into the frequency change. Pretty neat. 
I'm really getting into this guys work. He's one knowledgeable guy. 
If you lived in a world without the risk of horror and bad things, the good things would become dull and boring.
I have no reason to accept your assertions.
And consequentially easily re-engaged.
I'm not trying to be awkward here but I don't accept gravity as the cornerstone of empirical rational thought that you might.\n\nScientists can't explain it and instead of accepting that there might be a God responsible for it, they insert a theory of **Multi-verse**.  I swear, I'm not bullshitting you, respectable scientists inadequate to the task of explaining gravity reach for a sci-fi novel in an attempt to cover up the ~~gaping chasms~~cracks in their 'rational' explanations.
> One of the most well known, if not the most well known, arguments on why one should believe in some God(s).\n\nI'd heard the phrase before but had never felt compelled to look it up.  However, I reject your conclusion based on my lack of knowledge but its nice to know that  Atheist's are capable of emotions such as sadness and are not totally bereft of empathy.\n\nBefore I buy your impressive sounding medicine, please can you tell me what it actually does? 
Fine, but maybe I'll sacrifice your heart to my god first
I don't.
> Please expose literally any of the "chasms" or "cracks". Literally any\n\nAre you fucking kidding?  Let's just stick to Physics right?  Okay, how about there is a universally (by science I mean) approved model of the Universe at a macro (classical) scale and there is a universally approved model of the Universe at a micro (quantum) scale.\n\n**However**, these two models of the Universe **cannot** exist simultaneously!  It is **impossible** (without resorting to science fiction) to synthesize these two discourses!\n\n**Hence**\n\nDark Matter\n\nAnti Matter\n\nMultiverse Theory\n\nThe brane (short for 'membrane')\n\nBlack Holes Are Gate Ways To Another Universe Because We Can't Explain It With Our Tawdry Science\n\nI am perfectly willing,- seeing as Science is barely capable of determining the parameters of Gravity, let alone what it signifies- accepting that Gravity is *push down*  as opossed to a *pull down*.  Because it's Lent.
But if they don't believe in a Divine Justice, what is to stop them being sociopaths?
I didn't realize etiquette demanded that I remain glued to a particular sub and reply there and then.  Stuff I replied to was just cuz I was bored and at a bus stop.  Please assume what ever you want, but its this type of vitriol which gives Atheists a bad name.\n\nMost of my experiences with people who don't believe has been online, and I admit I don't have that much IRL experience (but a little).\n\nSummery, I didn't reply because I was unable to bring my wits together to engage in any in-depth and serious responses to what ultimately are important issues.  I have just got home and I am going to take a nap.  Maybe I am lazy.  Maybe I am sad.
Why would it matter? Faith isn't supposed to be fashionable.
If you read it, you'll find that it grants a lot of leeway.  I was into it before I'd either heard off it. \n\n*you are simply following what you have read or been told*\n\nI am really not. I reiterate;I was into it before I ever heard of it and I should perhaps have said it's *nearer* to that than anything else.\n\n*Why can you not explain it?*\n\nPerhaps because I am not eloquent enough.  But beyond colors and primary emotions, can we ever truly explain deep and profound things to the person next to us(other than mathematically based concepts)?  Language is very limited really.  God is a very little word that covers a lot of Universe and the words that enable us in our day to day lives, limit us when we attempt to dissect creation.
I live in the UK,  So we meet in the sea?
My sister walked in one time when I was watching Schindler's List.  It's got a shower scene.
Anyone can, whether they know it or not.
Well\n\na) here we are.  Alive.  Presented with an array of stimuli (creation/the Universe) in which we are able to assimilate and cross compare data and ultimately, evaluate it.  Where did that come from?\n\nb)what I believe in my heart
Because for atheists, evolution always seems to be a very emotive issue as if a lot of their arguments are hinged upon it
Because it undermines science
For example Buddhism seems a bit like a thing that hippies are into with all the Karma and also it's not very Monotheist compared to the big 3. \n\nEDIT----and please assume I'm not talking about the terrorist contingents within certain religions and leave that out of it.
So is the modern and common understanding of shirk (as in *shirk* your responsibilities) have any relation to the meaning in Islam.\n\nThey are not except like livestock. Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.\n\nSo essentially, it seems that according to Islam, it is better to be 'misguided' or 'ill informed' rather than to be utterly Godless.
parasites? Cancer? The plague?\n\nAll those bad things are there to provide context.
So atheists and scientists always ask for proof.  So is that all you need?  Proof of existence but not proof HOW or WHY a deity could exist?
God and his mysterious ways.
>  the failed Messiah claimant of Jesus \n\nWell he started a religion that we're talking about 2000 years later.  I wouldn't call that failure.  
Oh so were you raised in Mormon traditions?  If so, that makes me feel cheap because whatever I was going through must have seemed like a walk in the park in comparison.\n\nI feel like Iconoclastic control (which is a prevalent concern in corporate board room America/The West) is a major element in all Jesus derived faiths.  Which is a shame.
In the UK this seems to have been swept under the carpet.  There are other ongoing inquiries into other alleged rings of powerful pedophile networks (around late 70s-80s).  However as of yet, all these efforts have so far been beset by institutional procrastination, obscurification and general stonewalling and the victims of this horrendous abuse have little hope that the perpetrators will ever see justice.
> mass is attracted to other mass\n\nBy that you mean Gravity?  It's Ash Wednesday and I've already decided  on what I'm giving up.  Maybe next year though.
>  Right now I live in an apartment with an adorable cat and pretty good internet. \n\nIf stop believing in Atheism (just for Lent) you will still be able to enjoy those things!  I have a cat also!
Oh nice.  I would  put my cock in there at least 5 times.  Even if you had an annoying laugh. 15/20
if the sun is shining on the other side of the street, I cross.  A prophet could make a parable out of that.
Honestly, I don't think there's a lot you can do do unless you are able to somehow by chance get irrefutable proof (ie-video documentation of these horrible acts taking place) and then quickly disseminate the information as quickly as possible.\n\nDon't go to the newspapers, put it out online as quickly as possible.  And don't get any cute ideas about blackmail either (but I'm sure you're not that callous and mercenary).
No I went to bed..........and now I just woke up, that's all
everyone gets their own IMO.  To blindly accept dogma is a sin.  But I cant explain what I'm into.  Mostly its like Discordianism.  In fact, maybe it is exactly that.
Im not trying to say it is anything other than subjective btw
That only works if I'm monotheist.  Godslayer is not Gods Slayer so if I'm polytheist I'll be able to summon all the other Gods I believe in.
> if you can't even know 100% that your belief is real, why would you begin to debate it at all?"\n\nWell originally I came here to ask about gaps in evolutionary theory, not debate what I believe.  But given that premise that you think I conveniently skipped, atheists cant claim certitude either.
Maybe the type of God that leaves the ' proof' some people crave
I asked this question hours before he criticized me for not answering.
If God was casually miraculous, you would take them/him for granted and come to have a sense of entitlement.  If faith is an important component, then he wouldn't want to make it to obvious.
Yes but that collection of brains is -in terms of perceiving how the universe really is - a collection of flawed instruments,  and any instruments they make are the result of the flawed brains en-devours and consequentially flawed.  We have five senses, but who knows what other stimuli is out there to feel and experience?  Most telescopes depend on sight, but have we even thought of trying to make telescopes that depend on senses that don't exist?
Dont know.  Depends how long i have left.
Most of those words have been in the collective conscious mindset for *decades* and certainly existed before the advent of social media.  'Deep State' is phrase thrown about by the rabid Right and if it was not for your exposure to it on social media, its is unlikely it would have accrued enough traction on your mind to even warrant you asking the question.
I think that mosquitoes evolution is probably legit now.  But I still don't think atheists should use evolution as a kill shot against the possibility of deity.
Wikipedia is biased and I wouldn't accept it all at face value.  If you google 'Humming Bird Miracle' you will see other articles.
> isolating and humiliating\n\nAnd do you think you have ended up with psychosomatic sexual issues as a direct consequence of your exposure to an iconoclastic spiritual indoctrination dependent belief system that is reliant upon  a monolithic centralized authority as the sole agency of propriety,  moral decency and spiritual justice?
From what I understand, energy, as in terms of what an individual orgasm expends, isn't relevant in evolutionary trajectories.
Mike Pence would be upset because he'd have to get a new VP. So far Trump has been a useful distraction.
Golly
He is legit.
Yeah but I have evidence, you just decide to disregard it!
How can Trump not know continually going on about it means the media has to?
Shit, didn't even think of that. Maybe it's better to just go vigilante.
I mean better in the sense of being less risky sin wise and I guess also in terms of being nutritious for the soul
Yes but mosquitoes wouldn't be able to bank on just chancing across an open wound.  As a species.
No bullshit, I pressed the random button and I got here. Hmmm......
Because you come to r/debateanatheist
You would not really appreciate the good stuff if Creation was composed of just good stuff.  It takes bad stuff to really allow those fortunate enough to avoid the bad, to know how lucky they are are when the good happens.
Im not an Atheist but I don't subscribe to anything that would be considered a major religion.  Seeing as evolution is a highly emotive issue for Atheists  which they seem to use as the foundations for a lot of their arguments, I thought I'd ask them about certain gaps which I perceived in their theory.
I didn't know that Hinduism was bigger than Judaism.  I thought it was filed under miscellaneous.
I recommend supporting a sports star who's initials are AJ. That will help end this injustice.
Probably not.  I mean, I'd have to be tortured and subjected to advanced sleep deprivation techniques.  But conceivably, those cold be used on you.
He's real nice and benevolent and you do right by him, he'll do better by you:)
Formally?  Not for over 20 years.  But I am still curious about the efforts that great minds spend in dissecting the cosmos and creation so I check out science papers from time to time.
I read it and while I see your point, I think that giving up Atheism for Lent would be a good start in the right direction.
I dont understand.
I'm hearing 'can't' a lot on this post.
There's no point rereading this really.  No one has made any real attempt refute my initial premise.  Accusations of sophistry mean absolutely nothing to me but having watched a few more videos since I asked this question, I feel that there is a *lot* worse that I could allege about Molyneux.
Thank you for this answer, its really given me a lot to think about!
That's pure conjecture.
What if someone didn't *pick* one from one of the approved faiths and they're parents, school, peers and exposure to media had no bearing upon the *super natural* belief system they subscribed to and the God they believe in is theirs and theirs alone?  What if many subscribing theists would be more offended by they're beliefs than they are by standard atheism?  What if they're beliefs were more the result of consultation and negotiation rather submitting to a hegemonic doctrine crafted to placate field hands and scullery maid?  *Deciding* had little to do with it.  *Cultivating an understanding off* would be a lot closer.  there is no word for what i believe.\n\nWhen I said 'Faith isn't contingent upon evidence' I should have said *demonstrable* evidence.
But this is not an argument.
Because they act nutty and shouty and I can smell it and they would always wear garish, clashing colours.
So how long ago would you say this change occurred?  Would you say it coincided with Trump and Trump supporters (in which I guess I include Alex Jones) recent and relatively sudden upsurge in their presence on social media?
I do not.
I didn't say anything about a loving God
> Even if that may be, he still won\n\nYeah he won.  So he should just get down to business and stop talking as if he lost.
Well I don't care if you think I'm a dumb asshole but you're unnecessarily combative and abusive stance might convince people who are thinking about trying Atheism to leave it alone.  I'd rather be a dumb asshole than be sullen and bitter.
I would fuck that hard, I would fuck that gently.  Id fuck it both ways.  18/20
Because it's a strategy of the right; they have a need (even more so now that Trump is elected and appears to be besieged 360 degrees) to maintain a momentum that implies that *something new and profound is on the brink of happening* (it's not though).  Consequentially, they have a tendency to invent language and memes and this tendency is absent of the Left.\n\nMost of the language they invent tends to be emotive and short (because of the restrictions of Twitter) and is also geared to be easy to understand because the Right tends to have supporters that are unable to process reasoned and nuanced arguments.\n\nMost of the words and phrases that the Right has brought into the collective consciousness recently is emotion based but logic poor and tends to placate the tribal instincts of Trump supporters and their need to see the other side humiliated/hurt.\n\nie....\n**Butt Hurt**\n\n**Triggered**\n\n**Destroyed**\n\n**SJW**\n\n**Femiinazi**\n\n**Beta**(as in male)\n\n**Fake Media/Alternative Facts**\n\nAnd so on.  With 'Deep State', the right has taken a slight move torward the esoteric, somewhat restricting the banal dimensions of the language it employs that's usually used to imprint and goad the unsophisticated mindsets of typical Trump supporters.  'Deep State' has overtones of McCarthyism, it evokes the unsubstantiated fears some people have when they hear 'Bankers' (ie Jews) and sounds like something out of the TV show 24.\n\nIt really means nothing, but to the people who are easily wound up like clock work mice and then set to run in which ever direction they are set, it will seem further proof that the establishment are out to make Trump fail.\n\nAlso, after Trumps fucking press conference I'm starting to think he has dementia so I think you can expect more ploys like this as the right desperately tries to whitewash his escalating irrationality and impotency,\n\n\n\n
So really, he exposed a bug/glitch?  Technically?
There are other things in nature that we don't understand.  There is a bird (i *think* its the humming bird). Scientists (not biologists, but scientists who know about aerodynamics) have studied this bird and HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW IT FLYS.  Given its weight, given its wing strength, there's no way it should be able to maintain flight.  Yet it does.  You have proof that it fly's, but you arnt able to prove WHY ITS ABLE TO FLY.  \n\nIts almost as if Gods put a Wheel Of Perpetual Motion right in front of you,   because 'scientists' themselves have themselves called this bird miraculous.
Depends on how pretty the cashier is
Happy lambs skipping in Spring and nice stuff like that.
> Pascal's Wager\n\nI just looked it up....\n\n'' the potential benefits of believing are so vast as to make betting on theism rational''\n\nThat is nice and sucient and I couldn't have put it better myself
But is that repeated in Judaism and Islam?
> but there are also a plethora of philosophers and scientists who do agree with it.\n\nWell I bet there are lots of people with impeccable credentials who would dispute 'freedom of will'.  And if there is not, there is me.  Essentially, some people are playing on an uneven pitch, (poverty, hormone imbalances, diminished conception of deferment of gratification, mental problems).  These people are simply unable to exercise the restraints others are and will get chastised for it.\n\n''I think your problem is some God being a judge on your free will, not the concept itself''\n\nActually though, this made me think, and you may indeed be right. It might be that I have a problem with a singular and centralized monolithic authority.   As long as God is willing to give me and others a special pass for any transgressions we may have made when it comes to freedom of will, I would be willing to reciprocate this benevolence.  However that would in turn de-legitamize all institutional religions which champion punitive actions for those who 'sin'.\n\nBut mostly my problem was with the emphasis on blood.  Also snakes and things like that.
Stone cold hero right there-----not just for saving lives at the expense of his life but for working as a teacher despite being extremely qualified in a whole bunch of more well paid roles.
So far all I'm hearing is a lot of defeatism.  You're all like a bunch of overweight kids on the first day of Fat Camp grumbling because you have to walk 50 meters.  It gets easier, I promise, but there's only so much that can be done when you all have such a negative attitude.
Given that all 'offered evidence' has to be absorbed through the prism of the brain, which you denigrated to the status of an 'electrochemical computer' there is a limit to how much credence we should afford to any evidence.\n\nI don't differentiate between what I believe and what schizophrenics (or anyone else) believes, simply because I am unable to see into their souls.
Still worth doing it though.
This is not trolling blatant or otherwise.
Its not like that was tokenism or anything.
This is free form inquiry.  Calling Troll is pretty much the same thing as calling Nazi and the same thing as throwing in the towel.
Not all biases are blatent and a lot of the time, the people who have them are not actively aware they are approaching the subject matter with predispositions based on subjectivity rather than objectivity.  But I'm sure that the article on Hummingbirds wasn't made with deleberetly malignant intentions and furthermore admit that it may indeed be correct.  When I mentioned bias, I hadn't read the article at that point.  This comment is meant to address your concerns of insidious bias more than garner my original premises.
Faith isn't contingent upon evidence.
Evolution, in my understanding, adheres to a model of choosing the path of least resistance
> accepted the god claim without ANY evidence \n\nScientist's are as yet unable to come up with a satisfactory explanation of gravity yet they know it is there and believe in it (and hinge a lot of their science around it).  Im just saying there is a lot of gaps in science too.\n\nThere is no need to adopt such a combative stance,  It leads people like me to assume that Atheism is the result of psychological/emotional short comings.\n
Yeah but scientists don't accept what's in our hearts as  'evidence'.  
WAKE UP PEDES, THIS IS A LIEBRAL ATTEMPT TO DEFLECT FROM PIZZAGATE. FIGHT BACK! 🍕 🚼\n\n
REEEEEEEEE
It is almost like Milo, Epstein, and Soros have more than one thing in common, I just can't put my (((finger))) on it....\n\nT_D and its NWO shills are so predictable. They are absolute sheep. Quit defending the pedophiles because they are on your side when you know exactly what group of people are behind their actions. Pick your side, and disown Milo or stand for the globalist zionist destruction of your culture. You can't have it both ways. 
It is in BB best interest to fight that kind of thing, that's why they are popular, they aren't lamestream media. You still trust BB? BB is all about news for those who are woke, and i'm still not unsure why it wouldn't be in there best interest to fight that when that is literally why they became big in the first place. Unless BB is bowing down to MSM bc they are a bunch of cucks then there is no reason for them to be pussies like this, Milo included. They are losing all of their integrity. 
omg a nonpartisan post about a real conspiracy. Someone get this man gold!
He's a pedophile that became popular with the alt right for being a modern age shock  jock. (even though he called them all sociopaths before he became their idol, but he learned he could make money off them) \n\nHere's a picture of him bathing in blood if you have never seen him.  http://bedfordandbowery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_5535.jpg  
\nSpecial snowflake is triggered.  I thought Milo only did that to sjws?
>activist
he resigned from breitbart. Even if was asked, you are either implying that:\n\nA. Brietbart is a part of MSM. With Bannon in the white house and working hard alongside Donald in the fight against the MSM, I'd say that isn't the case.\n\nB. Breitbart gives a shit what liebral media thinks about them. They don't.\n\nWhy is BB bowing down to MSM when they became big fighting the MSM in the first place? Where is this MSM narrative against Milo coming from exactly? 
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/142/feelsgood.jpg\n
They targeted Milo.\n\nMilo.\n\nHe's a person who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than triggered liberals.\n\nHe'll punish himself doing things others would consider bigoted, because he think it's fun.\n\nHe'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional SJW all to draw out a single extra trigger per second.\n\nHe has made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same talking points over and over, hundreds of times to the point where he knows every little detail such that he has attained such sexist nirvana that he can literally trigger feminists blindfolded.\n\nDo these people have any idea how many articles have been written, women doxxed,  pc cultures have been destroyed in frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?\n\nThese people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our Milo? We're already building a new one without them. They take our news? Alt-righters aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the news up our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, pedos is going to change us? He's been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds while hitting on them. They picked a fight against a man that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened him with. Who takes it as a challange when they tell us he no longer matters. His obsession with proving he can after being told he can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big normies laughing at how pathetic he used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.\n\nMilo is competative, hard core, by nature. He loves a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange him. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another MSM fake news.\n\n
Not\n\nA\n\nConspiracy\n\n\nJesus i'd give anything for something related to 9/11 or bohemian grove or fucking aliens or some shit. This is a wikipedia article, there is no connection or implied connection to any conspiracy. At least Assange has a conspiracy behind the motives of his rape charges, you can post that shit instead, but this is absolute trash. \n\nThe only conspiracy going on here is T_D spreading their whataboutisms trying to influence conspiracy. 
Top Mind on why Obama didn't enact sharia law like they predicted: \n\n>The plan was for Hillary to do it, but since she lost (((Soros))) is making Trudeau do it.\n\nI can't even.\n\n
China will keep them just afloat, if I were Xi Jinping though, I would be looking at a way to get little Kim out. North Korea has too many rare earth resources and way too piss poor of a system for it to be invested in. The freight trains they stole, as an example.\n\nAgain, it will never happen, but if I were China, I would re-evaluate if the DPRK is worth more as a bargaining chip for its threats, or as an economic zone. The threat of destabilizing the region with a new regime would be worth it if they could iron out a deal with Russia, S. Korea and the US. I'll bet they have more than a few contacts among Pyongyang's old guard who feel the same way, but Kim's father and grandfather were exceedingly good at the whole "divide and rule" concept.
Oh completely agreed, not suggesting that China would want them to reunify, rather I would imagine China would have an incentive to maintain a buffer-state North Korea sans Kim

I love Scandal and it is a hot mess if issues 
I've talked to a lot of girls, succeeded little and failed a lot (no shame in admitting I get rejected, everyone does). From my point of view, it seems like she's not interested. \n\nI had this girl who would text me, double text me, reply to my message with something else, she was literally always trying to start/finish a conversation with me and I did/(do) not give a shit about relationships at the time because I'm still just 20 and that's what she wanted. Just the way that girl behaves reminds me a lot of what I would do to be 'considerate', I suppose. I would obviously see her message but would not respond immediately, I would usually wait. I would cancel on 'plans' because they weren't plans, usually just a 'hey if you're not doing anything on _____ we can....' sort of thing. \n\nNot saying this is the case for you, but I just wanted to let you know my thoughts. Who knows what your situation is, I don't, but if it seems like you're just being 'led on' or if it's just leading to nowhere, I would move on. 
I love playing Ana, I also love saving anyone caught in Reins charge and putting Mei to sleep before she gets that headshot. 
Yup this is it, thanks! Glad to know they have been found by the community!

I do not know a lot about what is montessori friendly for toddlers but from the studies i have read and from my experience with my (in my opinion) great kids it's very important to let them explore as they learn to crawl and walk. Baby proof everything you can they could reach, and also let them be able to open cabinets amd things so they can discover new things. Keep it interesting. Also no tv until 2, and after that very little. 
I read in some comment that for multi armed guys, you want to first equip a single handed weapon in your left 1 hand, then equip the two handed weapon in your right 1 hand.  That way you still get the benefit of the multi arm potential attack.\n\nYou definitely want your best weapon in your main hand, taking into consideration whatever abilities you have.  I think I also read somewhere that abilities do not extend to multi-arm attacks necessarily, so go ahead and put a badass sword in a different hand.
This is in Chicago by the way

r/politics is also extremely one sided.  Its good to visit both sides of the  story, because often you'll find out some 'facts' that the other side never bothers to bring up.
Partly because if it bleeds it leads.  People are used to seeing stories about economic swings, and a lot of people in r/collapse probably are very familiar with doomy economic predictions about how the NWO is going to bring it all down, one world currency blah blah.  And it just hasn't happened (yet).  So eventually people get desensitized to the latest doomy economic article.  Same thing with geopolitics, we're supposed to have had a one world government by now, yada yada.  Now I'm not saying I don't think that won't happen necessarily, but in terms of climate collapse, it literally may be happening right now, as this is the hottest its ever been in human history.  That kind of grabs your attention.  
yeah, that's where I'm looking.  For the main story line quests, those descriptions wrap around so nothing is cut off, but these 'new' ones do not wrap around
Beat me to posting this. Congrats!

Not done yet, but just noted this:\n\n>What stands out in the package of pseudo “relief” policies is the commitment to wage all-out war on labor standards and on the public sphere — which is ironic because the failure of public infrastructure is what turned Katrina into a human catastrophe.\n\nWait, they want to fight against the things that failed?  Putting it that way seems to make it sound logical...\n\nI personally think public infrastructure does need more help, her phrasing/ way of presenting this argument should be changed though

not his best stuff, but I prefer his podcast anyways.   He really dragged the fat stuff out I thought.
just to clarify:  \n>Conk: Activated; cooldown 10. You make an attack with a cudgel at an adjacent opponent. If you hit, you automatically daze your opponent. If your opponent is already stunned, you instead knock them unconscious for 30-40 rounds (unconscious opponents wake up dazed when they take damage).\n\nIf I understand the order, its dazed > stunned > unconscious .  So with Conk you auto daze, and if they are stunned they go unconscious.  \n\nWith Bludgeon is it the same, that if they are already stunned you can knock them unconscious?  
Regardless of what people think about the Fourth Turning, Bannon is going to act like its true.  \n\n>Where leaders had once been inclined to alleviate societal pressures, they will now aggravate them to command the nation’s attention\n\nthat kinda hits home

Thank god. I think Apple saw the success of the edge from Samsung and got excited.

That's a really good point I guess. It being real would be despicable. If it is real, I just want justice  
I don't know why I do this too. When I buy a new lift ticket I just put it over top of the old one. 
I'd like to remind everyone Jamarcus Russell made the same throw. 
I don't want another teams' garbage. Draft a QB. After the combine, Hue and Sachi will have their guy. Not only that... we have the picks and the leverage to get whoever we like. 
Duji swings from rovers balls and takes care of a lot of behind the scene crap that rover doesn't want to deal with. \n\nAs for Dieter... no idea how he can demand big contracts. 
Shit. We all gonna die 
Hue likes AJ and our new QB coach likes tyrod. We'll see who can convince Sashi 
I'd rather take Mahomes 
We are all the media now. We have to trust each other. 
Anyone else think that Rover is so argumentative today because of the child rapist blood flowing through his veins comment?
Colquitt that good?  Or can we get a better punter?
That one fan was not static. After I saw that, the level of the complexity multiplied. Then I remembered we have comeputers
Agreed. Mods are power hungry. "I'm sorry, I thought this was the internet?!?!?"
Meh. Haters gonna hate 
Our 3 picks should be.... Garrett, QB, getting more picks. I don't care what order we do it in, we need to do it. 
I'm sick of getting other teams' garbage. 
MacOS and iOS have been pretty subpar as of late. Not a lot of new features. They seem to be on a 2 year cycle for new features. I hope we get some 'Wows' this year. And let's be honest, time to unleash a new Siri. She is pathetic as far as digital assistants go. 
Along with the 10 year anniversary, there really wasn't a giant cosmetic upgrade from 6S to 7. There's been so many rumors of all the crazy features they've been wanting to add for about the last 2 and 1/2 years. The rumors last year were even saying don't buy the 7 because the 8 next year is gonna be nuts. 
What's behind those eyes screams sleeper agent. I'd play 'Relax' and see if she rips the Malaysian Prime Minister's head off. 
Safe to say Apple missed the mark with the touchbar. It's not what we wanted or needed. 
I think it's time we just accepted the fact that RMG is a political show now. Rover comes home from work turns on CNN, refuses sex from B2, then goes to sleep so the only thing he knows right now is politics. 
I never understood what riseup was though. I assume 'canery' is code for warning of something and I know it's how Wikileaks did something. That's all I know. 
I feel like malware bytes is so common and is always recommended that the best malware would avoid detection by it. Is there any other less popular program with an equal sophistication that would be better?  
I want to believe. Can't wait for the FBI, who hopefully has damning evidence, starts arresting people. 
I have no idea what we're excited about!
I've said it before. And I'll say it again. The Pam Anderson and Julian Assange thing is fucking weird.

If Garrett is a sure fire von Miller then he's a lock at 1. We have done this before and been burned with injuries. 
I only refer to him as daddy and I think I'm hot shit. 
Heh. My gf who is not a football fan, has the same reaction. She keeps saying "why do you keep saying that?"  "What does that even mean?"
My brother was an airplane mechanic at Dayton airforce base.  They sent up two fighter planes with no missiles. Flight 93 was deemed too hazardous to continue and was shot down with the machine guns equipped over farmland in Pennsylvania to minimize casualties. The whole passengers trying to overthrow the flight was American propaganda to cover up the fact we shot down a jetliner 
Love this idea 
Yeah, plus the draft is really the highlight of our year because we're always so optimistic with our high picks. Also, I'd add that our state of euphoria rarely reaches the bye week. I'd say that's over by halftime of week 2. 
Awesome answer. I thank you sincerely and wish you the best in all your endeavors 
Follow. The. Law. Not too hard. Become a citizen legally 
Always on ftw. Plus it's such a huge battery saver. I just hope that they can perfect the colors as well as the current phone. 
I wish GetGo would give Dieter and Charlie a new script. They've hashed out the same thing 700 ways. I think I could listen to a radio station of just Dieter and Charlie commercials as long as they were different every time 
Playoffs?  Playoffs?
Yes. Rover is a negative Nancy and it starts to effect the way that you think. I listen out of habit and I like their characters but I listen to positive podcasts and books on tape to offset the negativity.  I feel like if I stopped listening to RMG my life would be a lot better, but as bad as the shizzy is, it actually serves its purpose to keep me up to date as to what is going on in the world 
I want to hate pewdeepie. I also respect him a bit. This video makes me feel bad for him a bit. I'm really not sure how I feel. I'm sure he can wipe his tears with $100 bills. I do feel like the media is a vampire trying to save themselves 
I think it will be AJ
Well, here's how I feel. We had 1 win last year, we'll have more wins this year, almost guaranteed. What I really would consider a successful season is guys playing their hearts out for Hue, being competitive and not looking like a JV scrub team out there. I really just want to enjoy sundays, instead of now where I have to turn the game off at halftime/after first quarter. That is what a successful season looks like in my book. 
I don't like the political divide I see in the country. The demonization of the other side is scary to me. The division that Obama left has only gotten stronger. People aren't even discussing issues anymore. 
ESPN needs way more help than that. 
It'll be super curious to see how the Browns handle it. We'll know a lot once we figure out what we're doing with RG3. It also wouldn't shock me if we take Trubisky at 1 if they really like him. It's exciting because this front office has had a lot more time this year than they did last year. I just hope we somehow get some extraordinary players and set ourselves up well for next year's draft. 
I'd prefer we trade out if that's the case
USBC is regarded as the best port to put on a computer now. 
Because they'd make it spectacular and people would buy it and never need a new one. 
Keep r/conspiracy non-partisan!! I need to hear batshit conspiracies from both sides of the aisle!
I'm using my 6+. I don't think I'm going to buy another phone until this thing absolutely dies. Apple makes quality, and I actually think if I don't upgrade to ios13, I'll be fine. 
I'll never buy windows ever again. So much spyware built into windows 10. 
Worth every damn penny. Love this guy. 
See... I'm still trying to see the good in trump even after all the bad press. He basically has almost every msm attack him daily. I still think he wants to do good. 
I just don't really want the curved edges. To me, that just seems like shattered screen city and high replacement costs. 
I've read that there is a limited area humans can travel in space due to the rapid expansion of space itself unless we utilize worm holes. Can you discuss this?
Make it rain JOK
This is the gayest shit ever. I'm guessing that they've a sponsorship with that company and they sent them 3 for free for advertising.  Why do I wanna listen to 3 guys jerk off?
I actually hope we go Secondary and if the guy we want isnt there we trade out and pick up another first rounder for next season 
This was all a ruse set up by rover to get the focus off of how bad the show sucks and how it's all about trump now. 
Making someone little is demeaning. It makes you think lesser of them. 
Both. Let's fix the problem for sure 
What is a Browns Fan's Mean Jerk Time?
That 33 is gonna be $$$. Which is why I think we can trade it for some serious future picks. Although we did good here. 
:\\ if that's the case, it just seems like too much a coincidence. It wouldn't surprise me if they were compromised then. 
Damn. People on the show even think Rover is the father.... wow. 
There's only 1 news source that I know of that maintains a 100% accuracy rating.... 
I can't see them doing a yearly cycle for it. I think the smart thing to do is to wait until next spring to update it to wait for more of a demand. 
Now she's dead inside. 
Even if the VPs best friend is on the list?
*they're
I've always believed HFCS was added to all foods to keep people fat and happy. Now we can add stupid to the list. Thanks!
IMO, BB doesn't do that many bad deals... if he's willing to part with Jimmy G it must mean he's not that great. 
I want a player on my team with the name 'Taco'
Innocent until proven guilty. Hope if true he seeks the help that he needs. I don't wish ill on anyone. 
Stop trying to make a Terrelle Pryor/Jimmy G 3way happen, Mary Kay. It's not gonna happen. 
Guys. We're dropping RG3, drafting mahomes, and getting either AJ Or Tyrod. Book it. 
So glad you posted this. I was thinking about doing the same. It's a little outdated, but it really puts into perspective the amount of cost you have to pay to get quality. This is Roverfest X, I honestly think he should make the tickets $50 this year and get some serious acts. 
Switch wallpapers, change to bold text, rearrange apps, change sounds for texts and phone calls, 
Bottom up?
Biggest draft in modern era team history. This draft will determine whether or not we are a team of the future or the same old clowns. It's gonna be HUUUUUUGE
What the fuck? Are you high? 
Why did you choose to only focus on that comment instead of the pictures I included or anything else I said? I explained why (regardless of that comment) it is a real precarious situation. I understand your point about the comment I shared, but the rest of what I said rings true. \n\nYes, it is getting coverage, but when I hear a local anchor say "the erosion isn't that bad" it makes me do a double take, because they are actively hiding how dire a situation this is. Not to mention all you did was a google search. Honestly, how many people are even aware of it enough to peruse google for the story?? Turn on Fox, CNN, NBC, CBS, none of them are saying shit about it. \n\nThe conspiracy of it is that they knew this dam was in bad shape YEARS AGO. They even received funding and instead chose to use that funding for other non-infrastructure based things instead of fixing Oroville Dam. \n\nFWIW; inflow rose 20k CFS over the past hour, and the reservoir is beginning to fill again. If the inflow tops 100k (which is a distinct possibility w/ incoming rain and snowmelt), they are fucked. The dam physically cannot handle an outflow anymore than 100k due to the damage. \n\nAs is, they've had outflow choked down to 60k CFS for two days now in an attempt to lessen the erosion damage and because levees/diversion dams/rivers down stream are at capacity. Don Pedro reservoir, and Strawberry Valley Reservoir are also nearing capacity. \n\nSo like I said, the conspiracy here is two fold; they knew about it for years and didn't fix it, and the full truth about the situation is being with-held. \n\nI'm not here to say the dam, the spillway, or emergency spillway will collapse. All I'm saying here is there is a lot of info not being shared with the public, and if a couple things go the wrong way, shit could get bad in a hurry. \n\n*edit - They will be opening the Don Pedro spillway for the first time in 20 years at 3pm PST*\n\nhttp://www.mymotherlode.com/news/local/284537/don-pedro-reservoir-spillway-may-open-after-3pm.html
If I have to see that goofy toothed fuckstick Ryan lift the Lombardi, I will literally reach God levels of anger. 
They just lowered outflow to 70k. Something is absolutely fucky here. Also, it appears as if Strawberry Valley Reservoir is also nearing capacity and that is just north of Sacramento. Added to which, Hellhole reservoir is also topped off, and that feeds into Folsom Dam. \n\nRead this on another board;\n\n"If Hellhole Reservoir Dam pops then it'll take Folsom Dam with it at this point. Both of them are full and Hellhole was so bad Gov. Brown actually approved it's improvement.\n\nhttp://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2016/06/california-planning-us-1-8-million-hell-hole-dam-core-raise-project.html\n\nAre we looking left when we should be looking right?"\n\nAnd this. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/Sxrlv74\n\nI am beginning to doubt that the spillway is their main concern.... 
I'd use a super virus which I already had a cure for. Let it do it's work, and then release the cure. 
For those who are empathic, we have felt this energy building for a while now. For me, it seems to ramp up in intensity a little more everyday. I absolutely, 100% believe something is coming. \n\nThe something won't just be one thing either, it is like you said, right now the storm is offshore, it's kicking up waves and a storm surge is beginning, the next step is landfall. \n\nWith storms you have wind, lightning, flooding, tornados etc. Ever been in a hurricane? I have. And the eye is almost the most peaceful, blissful calm you can imagine, but you know what is even more peaceful than that? Those first few moments after the storm has passed. The atmosphere is calm and still. The sun is breaking through. Aside from the destruction the storm leaves behind, it is truly beautiful.  \n\nThat being said, while the storm is passing, it is absolutely fucking terrifying. It is hard to explain unless you've been through it, but I assure you, it rattles you no matter how badass you think you are. \n\nSo I'd advise most folks to remember to stay centered. Stay in your own peace and let it reflect unto others, and like u/Putin_loves_cats said, buckle the fuck up. Shits gonna get turbulent. 
Needs more research methinks. \n\nGiven their penchant for being whiny bastards, I'm not so sure the summer heat would do them any favors. Fuckers would probably plan a protest against the sun...\n\nI can see it now, chants of "who shuts light down, we shut light down!", and mass complaining because the sun actually made them break a sweat. \n\n

Francis because someone with vision that good needs to feed the puck to Aho. Or Pronger, because we could use an absolute bastard on the backend. \n
I just saw a live stream and traffic looks gridlocked. Fucking hell. Given Seaman and Stone's tweets tonight, could this be a distractionary FF? I also saw in that thread posted 3 days ago that they are hiding how bad it is and they are actually worried about the dam itself cutting loose. \n\n
Who is bangbus? 
It certainly seems that way, eh? The choice of username made my snowflake alarm go off... 
I'm reaching the same point. And when I say I'm done, I mean I'm done trying to enlighten mother fuckers. I'll never be done researching and fighting, but my tolerance for dealing with close minded idiots and shills has reached it's end. \n\nYou remember The Watchmen? There was a journal entry from Rorschach, and in it he says *"The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up around their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll whisper "No.""*\n\nThat is how I feel. I know a lot of people I used to consider close friends (they've since been jettisoned), and it seems they have actually become more close minded, and more blue pilled. 90% of them have openly laughed at me and my beliefs, or they chastise me for being a "conspiritard", one day these people will look at folks like you and I, and beg for help. Beg for knowledge. Beg for enlightenment. They will beg to be in our good graces. And I will look at them and simply say "No". \n\n....and I won't feel a fuck bit of remorse, either. They've had their chance to wake up, and they chose to take more Ambien instead. 
GWG is the same. It's a 2 point bonus. So 3 + 2. \n\nAnd yeah, I hate that about plus/minus but me and a buddy run the league together and he won't budge. Makes no sense to me that ES goals are worth as much as PPG. \n\nIf it were completely up to me, I'd score it as 2pts for an ES goal (plus 1 for the plus). I'd basically drop ES goals to 2pts and ES assists to 1pt while leaving powerplay points the same. \n\nFWIW; I absolutely hate plus/minus and I am in the camp that believes it has become a useless stat. Especially for fantasy purposes. 
Exactly, and no one is talking about this. The problem is, they can't fix ANY of this until it stops raining and the snow melt takes place. \n\nLike I said, it is a really bad situation. 
I traded for him the day he got hurt. Glad I got half a game out of him.... 
Yep. I'm in Charlotte. The weather has been absurd to say the least. 
Thanks. I plan on looking into unemployment asap. 
Fuck. You know what's sad? I live in Charlotte and I worked for the Hornets. \n\nI went full retard. 
His opinion is that they are the same guy. 
I agree. It is pretty disgraceful IMO. 
Wait. You mean to tell me a groundhog with no formal training or education in meteorology got it wrong? The hell you say! 
I noticed that, too. \n\nAlso, for those of us into symbolism, and realizing how cabal uses it in conjunction with false flags; The New Orleans **[Removed: Hornets]** Pelicans are playing against Sacramento in Sacramento tonight.  \n\n*Edit; went full retard and referred to the Pelicans as the Hornets* 
After checking, we have 7 goalies in our top 50. So whatever we are doing is working. The skater points in our league balance it out, as well as tagging a tendy with -1 for a loss. 
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! WOOOOOOOW. \n\nBest. Super Bowl. Ever. 
Brady is launching darts. Fucking A. \n\nLove him or hate him, dude is the GOAT. 
 I second this. I really like Duchene's game and I absolutely think he could really shine here. He also has term, and it wouldn't just be a rental. Dutch is a fantastic player. 
She also works real hard at trashing anything Pro-Trump, slamming anything pedo related, and making jokes that she is the Anti-Christ. \n\nA real winner, this one. \n\nI find it funny that she has called someone a shill..given her comment content and account age, the hypocrisy is laughable. 
Then ya got this beauty moving in right behind it...\n\nhttp://imgur.com/oIg0DcW\n\nI'm mostly an optimist, but that dam looks to be fucked. 
"Hey guys, this thing hasn't quite failed the way we need it to. Let's go drop some fucking boulders on it to finish that spillway off once and for all". \n\nJust sayin. These seems like it could totally backfire. 
I'm curious. How does one do cock off a cock? 
Yes we are. I've been keeping up with all of it, and that dam is fucked. Only a miracle will keep a catastrophic event from happening at some point.\n\nThey can't repair the spillway because they can't shut it off or else the reservoir tops off. The snowpack is 128% above normal, and it hasn't started melting yet. 12-13 inches of rain expected today, ground is already saturated, water has nowhere to go, and the water is literally eroding the ground all the way up the spillway. It is not a good situation. \n\nOn the left; the spillway last week. On the right; the spillway yesterday. See all that mud? That's bad. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/5PhLQMz\n\nhttp://imgur.com/cdvDvJ5\n\nHere is a comment better explaining how bad this *could* get. \n\n**"Here's what is causing so much concern: If the atmospheric river stalls, there could be up to a foot of rain in a span of about 36 hours over places that are already flooding—that's a rainfall intensity that isn't expected more than once a century, or even more rare. At risk is the vast network of levees and dams and diversions that literally make modern California what it is, and protect hundreds of thousands of people. If this system is compromised, the scale of disaster would be among the worst in U.S. history. A dire 2011 New York Times magazine piece outlines the scenario. It's not pretty.**\n\n**The implications of this flood would be huge: If the levee system is breached, Sacramento could have 30ft of flooding, and much of the state's water delivery system could be paralyzed by an influx of saltwater, including much of southern California. Two-thirds of people in the state could lose fresh water. That's not to mention the potential loss of life. Of course, this is not a given based on the latest weather forecast—but the fact that it can't be ruled out should cause everyone in the region to pay close attention.**\n\n**This is something that should be wall-to-wall national coverage, but I haven't seen circulated much so far. Please help get the word out."**
They're mocking us.... that's all it is. They aren't revealing anything. Just making us look crazy. Now every time a theory is brought up, someone will just say "oh, so you must like avocados".\n\nGive me a break. Fuck Fox and fuck the NFL. 
Yeah, I'm gonna order a BOGO pie from a local pizza joint and stuff my fatass. That's what will happen today. 
*Fuck the foulcunts* \n\nFTFY.

The Aussie at Fox is Rupert Murdoch. \n\nWSJ = Wall St Journal. 
I know right? I can actually sit and watch him roasting people on youtube all damn day. Gowdy/Gabbard 2020 should be a thing. 
In no particular order;\n\n- Tell Bannon and Preibus to beat it. \n\n- Take down Killary and Co. \n\n- Stop the rampant pedophilia in DC. \n\n- Dismantle the CIA.\n\n- Dismantle the Federal Reserve. \n\n- Nuke CNN. \n\n- Give up the spray tan. \n\n*edit - also, it'd be really cool if he dropped an ET truth bomb.*
I live in Charlotte NC. Took these a couple weeks back while sitting outside. Didn't see an aircraft, but you'll notice in the timestamps how quickly the "contrails" made nearly the entire sky overcast and gray.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/QhrQpTx\n\nhttp://imgur.com/xfk6XYm\n\nhttp://imgur.com/eFawQnr\n\nhttp://imgur.com/VVtydKm
That is the same person. Been around audio engineering and sound my whole life. Unless those two were manipulated to sound alike, that is the same fucking guy. 
I think Trump regretted it the moment he walked into the White House for the first time. I don't particularly like the man, but I also don't hold the vitriolic hatred towards him that a lot of folks do. \n\nThat being said; it is clear the the IC/Deep State is out to get him. And they just may. 
Contrary to belief, my username has nothing to do with Anaheim. \n\nWhen I was 20, we were having a family cookout. It was near a pond at my brother's place. There was a small flock of ducks meandering around the pond. \n\nI was manning the grill, and one waddles up. I'm an animal lover so I didn't wanna be too mean to the little fucker. He kept following me and it was beginning to get annoying so I just tried to shoo him away. \n\nHe let's out (from what I could tell) a distressed "this human is fucking with me" quack. This arouses the interest of 5-7 other ducks in his little rogue duck gang. It is at this point that the ducks charge. Like the calvary..these fuckers were out to get me. They begin hissing and chasing me in circles. Now keep in mind, I'm a big dude (about 6'3 200), so the sight of me running around screaming like Ned Flanders was a sight to behold. \n\nI didn't want to hurt the ducks so I began defending myself with a broom (one of those little 3 foot long deck brooms). Swatting and swinging. My brother, God bless him, was literally rolling on the ground laughing and was unable to lend a hand to help. \n\nMy fiancé' at the time, who is now my wife, jumped in for the save. She distracted them by tossing a fuckload of bread away from us and near the pond. This seemed to pacify these endlessly evil creatures and the incident was dispersed. \n\nI promise, it was a LOT fucking funnier if you were there, and ever since then, I've held a substantial grudge against ducks, and to a lesser extent geese...ya know, because guilty by association. 
I tore my labrum a couple months back. Shit sucked. I've had 2 knee surgeries and they didn't even really compare. 
It always got me why everyone always wonders why guys like him, Icke and Jones keep getting away with what they do without being "handled"....\n\nThat answer is simple; all 3 are in the public eye. Any of them end up dead under suspicious means and all it will do is help validate their causes and make martyrs of them. TPTB definitely do NOT want that. \n\nThat's why they're all still alive. At some point, they *all* took a deal wherein they get to live, but they have to spread more mistruth than truth while managing to appear a bit crazy or nutty to normies as to discredit themselves/conspiracies in the public eye. \n\n\n\n
If one of my family members died because an ambulance couldn't reach them because a bunch of SJW retards decided to block a road, you better believe I'd beat the fuck out of all of them one by one.\n\nBlocking streets, breaking shit, and starting fires is not a peaceful protest. \n\nMy state is one of the ones making it illegal (North Carolina). I live in Charlotte, I saw the protests and riots firsthand. As long as Soros keeps funding the likes of BLM and Antifa, there is no such thing as a peaceful protest. \n\nI fucking saw it man. I saw the goddamn busses roll in from out of town, loaded with nothing but black mask wearing shit starters. The shit needs to stop. 
$50 says she wears a hijab made out of an American flag.

Holy crap! I *need* this. Looks amazing, thanks for the chance. 
If Ocean's 11 taught me anything, it's that there is *most definitely* a heist happening in Brussels right now. 
The following is one of my favorite quotes in history. \n\n#“Posterity! You will never know how much it cost the present Generation to preserve your Freedom! I hope you will make good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven, that I ever took half the Pains to preserve it.”\n\n– **John Adams**\n\nAdams was also keenly aware how history is shaped to fit a narrative. The dude hated the painting of the signing of the Declaration Of Independence because it didn't accurately represent history... \n\nMy question for you; do you believe these forefathers were true patriots who were very aware of the Cabal bloodlines, and they saw the revolution as their chance to break free? Or do you believe they were "led" to their beliefs of patriotism by unknown forces without their knowledge? 
FML
IMO it has nothing to do with HRC. \n\nAssange is threatening TPTB. His asylum is at risk, he is basically saying "release me from these charges, or I spill the beans on 9/11". 
If Trump resigned or stepped down, Pence would become President. Moore is fucking delusional. In no way would Clinton get in office if Trump steps down, resigns, or is impeached. \n\nAnd if Trump and Pence were removed, Paul Ryan would become President and Orrin Hatch would become Vice President. Further down the list past them you have; Tillerson, Mnunchin, Mattis, and Sessions (in that order). \n\nThere is even precedent for what happens when a President resigns (Nixon). Like I said, Moore is off his rocker and grasping at straws that have long since been gone. \n\nSomeone tell this tubby bastard to shut up and hit a treadmill. \n
Soooo what else is on TV at the moment? 
Oliver is a fucking cum bucket. A controlled puppet with a hand up his ass. Fuck him, and all the rhetoric he spews. 
Fox had nothing to do with it? \n\nYou do understand that major networks screen all commercials and ads before they are ran, right? \n\nSource; my family has been involved in television production my entire life. Someone at Fox saw that ad and probably said "fuck yeah, this is exactly what we want". \n\nDon't be so naive. Rupert Murdoch is no angel and Fox is among the very worst offenders at brainwashing people and pushing their own agenda. \n\nFox is well aware of every single second of anything that airs on any of their stations. I promise if it were an ad glorifying conspiracies, it wouldn't have ran. 
Fucking fantastic post u/Putin_loves_cats. \n\nSaved, and I've already begun to dive in. 
Agreed. Seems like there have been a shitload of arrests today. Including the Chief Analyst of the NY National Guard and an Alderman, as well as the Ohio International Adoption Agency being raided by the FBI. \n\nIs this normal, or could this be the beginning of a larger scheme? Though, I'm a bit reticent to get my hopes up given all the folks crying wolf.  
Wow. 2 towers onstage that are on fire. Thats real subtle...
**"You don't deserve a human body if you use it to destroy souls."**\n\nWow. Love it. \n\nI hope you don't mind, but I *had* to share that quote. 
Exactly! Fuck plus/minus as a fantasy category. Such a crap shoot. 
Umm. HAARP wasn't disabled. As a matter of fact it was put back in use this week. Not LA related, but; \n\n"Fallens experiments will take place Feb 19th - 22nd". \n\nHuh. The 19th is when the heaviest rain (10-12 inches) will be hitting Oroville and the Sierras...the dam has only cleared enough water out to accommodate 7.2 inches of rain. \n\nhttp://www.arrl.org/news/view/alaska-s-haarp-facility-once-again-open-for-business\n\nInterestingly enough, bubbles were seen at the dam, and then at some point yesterday most of the livecams around the dam were disabled.\n\nCan we also talk about how this storm is named "Lucifer"?? 
Agreed with all mentioned and I'm gonna add Tony Amonte, Alex Mogilny, and Marc Savard to the list. 
It's February 12th, and it is 75 degrees outside, And has been for two weeks. Trees are blooming, flowers are blooming. Peach and Strawberry crops have begun to bloom. \n\nThe average high here this time of year is in the mid 40's to low 50's. \n\nBut yeah, the planet is *totally* fine. /s
It's dick-butt's stoner twin dick-bud! 
Sir. \n\nAnd shit, didn't mean to make you waste cider. My apologies. 
Absolutely agreed. I won't take anti-depressants. Period. \n\nI've been on Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Effexor in the past, and all of them made me feel like a total zombie. 
My league does the following; GA -1, Save 0.2, Shutout 5, win 3, Loss -1. \n\nYour league gives more points for a win than a shutout, which I find odd as shutouts are harder to get than wins. \n\nDrop your wins down to 3, add a -1 for a loss, and it should equal things out. 
My father has been an audio engineer my whole life. I went to school for it for a bit before deciding on my current path. I am also a musician, and to this day I still go to my dad's studio. \n\nI am not an engineer but I am every bit as familiar with audio as I am my current career, I just choose not to do it for a living. 
That's what I can't figure out. What's the motive for for not telling people the situation? \n\nI'm curious to know what natural resources etc lie underneath that land. It is also curious to me that HAARP was fired back up, with the bulk of "experiments" being carried out Feb 19th - 22nd. \n\nWhat is curious about that, is, this storm intensified a great deal in a short time frame. Rain estimates jumped from 5-6 inches to 12-13inches in the span of a couple hours. \n\nI will find the HAARP link and edit it in. \n\n*edit - added HAARP link* \n\n**"This time my experiments will largely focus on artificial radio-induced airglow that potentially can be photographed from nearly anywhere in Alaska — weather permitting,” Fallen told ARRL. “I plan to start and stop each experiment block with an audio Luxembourg-style broadcast — transmitting two amplitude-modulated carrier waves at different frequencies separated by about 1 MHz, with the resulting skywave signal being a mix of both frequencies.”**\n\nI take the reason given for firing HAARP back up with a grain of salt. At the least, it is suspect given the timing of it in conjunction with the ridiculously heavy rain California has been getting. \n\nhttp://www.arrl.org/news/view/alaska-s-haarp-facility-once-again-open-for-business\n
Saw on the Panther's sub he is okay and just cramped up. 
I'm gonna guess he is getting at Flynn being forced out because of an underlying reason we don't know. And that they didn't have anything to use against him so they had to dig REAL deep to find a reason. \n\nThe Logan Act is what he supposedly violated, and it's only been invoked once. It's actually a good find. Seeing as how violating The Logan Act is why they are removing him, and using The Logan Act as a reason to remove a cabinet member has only happened once, it comes off fishy as hell. 
I'm in. 
It would depend on what you wanted to do with them. I was a chef for the team and arena. They are always looking for and accepting interns though, man. Never hurts to try :). 
This guy is a real criminal element. No really, he should be in San Quentin.

I'd have to check our league to see how many are in the top 50. If I had to guess, I'd say 6-7 are in our top 50. \n\nIt isn't as much about how many are in your top 50, but more so about giving the appropriate value to them with scoring. \n\nAnother thing you can do is adjust your skater scoring as well. Here is our scoring for skaters; \n\nG - 3pts \nA - 2pts\nPlus/Minus - 1pt or -1pt\nPPG - 4pts\nPPA - 3pts\nSHG - 5 pts\nSHA - 4pts\nGWG - 2pts\nSOG - 0.2pts\nHits - 0.5pt\nBlocks - 0.5pts\nFOW - 0.2pts\nPIM - 0.5pts\nHat Trick - 3pts\n\nHaving that many categories really opened the field up so to speak. In other words; there is value across the board. I have Mike Fisher and Brandon Dubinsky on my squad, and due to their overall production, they both average over 6.0ppg. I also have Seguin, and he averages 6.3ppg. \n\nMy point being; the way our league is setup allows for people to compete without having all the "superstars". It gives value to those 3rd and 4th line guys. And it also serves to make it more a point to manage your team and the matchups day to day. 
Hey ya'll. This dark timeline just got brighter. \n\nCan't believe I'm about to say this. But, GO PATS!!!!
Yes. It is an earthen dam. 
Thank you for your kind words. That's actually what I did. I was a culinary instructor/feeding project manager/banquet chef for this company. 
Pretty sure Lewis just fucked his knee up again. That looked painful. 
Roads looked gridlocked in vids I am seeing. This could be bad, guys. Real bad. I pray that damn holds til as many as possible are out of harm's way. 
Quite frankly, I'm still surprised he has a crowd. Frontal lobotomies must be cheap these days...  
This dude has balls the size of coconuts. I mean really, he is a fucking pit bull. A real life Frank Underwood without the corruption (that we know of) \n\nHe legitimately seems like one of the good ones. This dude needs to be AG. 
Game over. Fuck football for the time being. Over it. 
I had been in therapy once a week until surgery. The work comp checks weren't enough for me to afford therapy along with bills. My therapist has a sliding scale and I just sent her an email asking what, if any financial help could be offered so I can continue therapy. \n\nBut you are right, therapy is huge and I need to go back. 
Yes, your second assumption is correct. When I wrote our points down, I wrote the total points received. So, PPG is altogether 5 points, not 3 for the  goal plus 5. 
It's happening! 
I've already reached out to my lawyer. The state I'm in is not a right to work state, unfortunately what they did is 100% legal. 
Fantastic post OP. Bookmarked and saved for further reading/research. \n\nPertaining to the Blue Beam Cosmic False Flag theory; I wonder if chemtrails have anything to do with it? Like preparing the atmosphere to better reflect and see holograms. \n\nI know you didn't mention chemtrails, but it was just a random thought I had. 
Right there with you. I have a *really* good memory. As in photographic. Diagnosed when I was 9. Except when I say that, I get drilled with downvotes by shills. \n\nThere are 3 things I DISTINCTLY remember, and I will believe them til the day I die. \n\n1 - It was Berenstein, with an E.\n\n2 - Dolly had braces. \n\n3 - Louie died in the early 2000's. 
I wouldn't do it lol. But if I were an evil prick who was a member of the global cabal, I would. 
Agreed. I never liked the guy, never found him funny, never so much as sneered at a joke of his. \n\nSomething there isn't quite right IMO. Dude is a big time Atheist, too. And it isn't even that he's an Atheist, it's that he seems to have an awful lot of anger and angst towards those who do believe in a Higher Power. \n\nI dunno, dude just seems kind of soulless to me if that makes sense.

Your reading comprehension is questionable. \n\nI said they would ban it if it GLORIFIED conspiracies. Meaning; if that ad made us look good, they wouldn't have allowed it. \n\nIt made us look terrible, so they allowed it. 
Pretty sure this is a moot point. The election was verified. The electoral college confirmed it. He was inaugurated. I just don't legally see how anything can come of this.  
Two towers on fire were real subtle I thought....\n\n-smh- \n\nLots of red, orange and purple, too. \n\nAlso, the lights were drones. 
I have my own qualms with Infowars.  However in regards to his claims of the elites talking to extra-dimensional deities - you don't have to go much further than Laura Magdalene Eisenhower, grand daughter of the Eisenhower, to find a new age version of that same tale.\n\nYou will find her mother on the other hand in a constant back and forth with the current administration on a range of foreign policy and space related topics.... But no one is questioning her on what exactly it was that she raised her daughter believing.
Sure, back in December.

This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.
Several documents came to light during the 1988 presidential campaign, San Francisco Examiner, August 25, 1988, "FBI: 'Bush' called about JFK killing"\n\nThe article says the FBI followed up on George H.W. Bush's tip and found James Milton Parrott had an alibi for the time of JFK's assassination. \n\nQuote:\n\n"Houston sources said Parrott, who couldn't be reached for comment, was connected with the John Birch Society and right-wing Texas groups. He was fighting Bush and other moderates for control of the state's Republican Party.\n\nParrott is now a Precinct Captain for the Republican Party in Harris County, Texas."\n\nFurther details of the document were corroborated by Russ Baker and Barbara's own recent memoirs, as Bush's recollection that day is a riddle wrapped inside of an enigma:\n\nhttp://whowhatwhy.org/2013/10/09/bush-and-the-jfk-hit-part-4-barbaras-hair-raising-day/\n\nParrot as you will discover was a distant family acquaintance of the Bush's and apparently was hanging signs for the local young Republican club on the day of the assassination.\n\nAll very peculiar for someone who wasn't "officially" into spy work until his appointment as CIA director and whose father was intimate acquaintances of both the OSS elite and eventual CIA elite.
Head of the Secret Service is retiring and Trump has keep on pieces of his own private security firm.  The military by and large are supporting him at the moment and the mix of industrialists and Generals show at least tacit support from various levers of power.  \n\nAuspices of the intelligence complex are spasming so anything could be possible but unlikely.\n\nWhatever happened in Dallas '63 was a failure of the Secret Service, the military, the Central Intelligence Agency, and I doubt could be replicated in this age of digital communications monitoring.\n\nIf something were to happen I would think we would be seeing a color revolution precipitating a coup, mass demonstrations, and work stoppages.  Once the weather improves in the vast majority of the country then I would be taking the temperature of the situation.  Both sides have already proven that their oaths to the democratic process are nil.

Same way this SUB has been turned into the Pizzagatezone there is an information war on going between two factions of our elites.  The Wall Street Corporate Globalists and a Dominionist America First Faction.  At least this Civil War is being fought in cyberspace and not at wonderful places like Antietam, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and Petersburg. 
No qualms with the book being well written or entertaining and it does synthesis several interesting stories and partial stories.
On the money.\n\nWikileaks is still likely a limited Mossad hangout, this is all speculation.  I just find it incredulous after all these years and not one serious leak from one of the most active intelligence services in the entire world... And from one of two global powers that seek hegemony.  Gasp.
They will make equivalents to the Night of the Long Knives to complete the meme and incantation.\n\n
I actually didn't mean to come off as harsh if I did.  You have a lot of solid leads and I sincerely believe there is something peculiar about Antarctica.  I do however believe Greer's particular peculiarities do more harm than good as a four decade watcher of the UFO community.\n\nDo some more digging into the Nazi UFO Mythos, specifically Henry Steven's Hitler's Flying Saucers.  While Steven's runs an anti-Semitic think tank that I can't agree with and some of his Rense interviews are unbearable... However his text will link you back to actual physical documents that you could request from the National Archive or FOIA requests on the topic.
"Ten times out of ten the pupils are trained to take aim and fire at the privileged pet-peeves of postmodernism. These are: patriarchy, phallocracy, paternalism, racism, sexism, machismo, racist industrial pollution (that is, only that pollution that is putatively caused by the white elites and discharged on “minorities”), Europe, Eurocentrism, the white European male, the male in general, Columbus and the Catholics, religion, God, transcendence, metaphysics, metaphysics, the spirit, colonization and early imperialism, and sometimes, ever more infrequently, “capitalism,” preferably singled out as a vague synonym for economic oppression. Never, though, are the students made to visit the polemic upon the concrete working of the hierarchies of real power: say, to investigate the effective composition, functioning, and history of the political and financial establishments of the West."    The Ideology of Tyranny: The Use of Neo-Gnostic Myth in American Politics. Guido Giacomo Preparata.
Look at Greer and a more limited angle Wilcock and Goode's monetary links back to both Rockefeller and curiously enough James Woolsey endorsed think tanks and foundations.  Woolsey, a former CIA man and Trump adviser has a reputation of being involved in nearly every alternative energy project for three decades.
A great YouTube clip of one of Copper's last shows calling out Alex Jones, The Alex Jones deception:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHXdz4ApxOQ\n\nSaw Bill speak several times and he told a great story but something always felt off and not just from a deeper research of his biography.  Going all the way back to his jump out of the UFOlogy community and into the militia milieu.  He was a human like most of us but had his faults on display several times on shortwave which may have tainted his legacy.\n\nFortunately if you go back to his archive of shows and give a listen... He was totally correct about the national security state he was just unaware of how far technology would come just a decade since his death and how we are being oppressed by a technocratic tyranny.\n\n
Also did not include his wonderful claims about black goo underneath the earth mind controlling us, the Shroud of Turin, and a ton of questionable comments on Coast to Coast AM over the years.\n\nThis guy isn't after anything resembling '1776' or what is the assumed patriot movement party line now.
Imperial policy is to distract with a false sense of freedoms at home while enslaving overseas.  Distract from the myth at home that new-liberals must tell themselves to sleep at night and the world goes crazy.  They are unable to process the truth about the national security complex, drone assassinations, and the violations of the Constitution and the CIA's charter.  The hardest thing to do is actually look in the mirror.

I wasn't inditing political spectrum liberals.  Neo-liberalism is the philosophical break from traditional of the Age of Enlightenment to the benighted benevolent belief in benevolent Laissez-faire capitalism as the panacea for society's ills.  Both parties engage in that bit of intellectual sophism in fact it is at the core of our uneasy post Cold-War political truce. 
Family of Secrets - The Bush Dynasty, America's Invisible Government by Russ Baker gives a lot of hints of what will remain missing.\n\nYou can find their FOIA request of what is official still not released here:\n\nhttps://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/view/record?objectId=090004d280af239b&fromSearch=true\n\nDevil's Chessboard by David Talbot.\n\nBoth bring up issues with the known documentation that is still yet to be released:\n\n\nWhile if you really want to go down the rabbit hole look at this CIA study on what they were willing to admit they were hiding two years ago in their 'Studies in Intelligence' series article:\n\nDCI John McCone and the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy\n\nhttp://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB493/docs/intell_ebb_026.PDF\n\nThe Mary Ferrell organization still has a running list of things missing, including the testimony that G.H.W. Bush gave to the Church Committee Hearings along with several other more interesting documents... However the group does good work but is infiltrated with intelligence types of all types and M.F. herself was an OSS Society member.
He also had several comments last evening about Secret Space programs, the Illuminati as shown, deep state agents, and hitting a great hits list of every conspiracy out there.  It looked like a play for twitter attention, a guest spot on Ancient Aliens, mayhaps both.\n\nIf his deep state agents have proof they should likely be dumping it on the nearest friendly media outfit with actual verifiable documentation.  \n\nHis current career trajectory in the last year appears to be one of sheep dipping as he has left HuffPo in a scandal and has spent the last little bit fanning Pizzagate flames.
Never tell him the odds.

- The 1968 RFK assassination\n\n- Gladio networks and terrorism of the Cold War.\n\n- CIA, MI6, Mossad training of and cooperation with the drug cartels and drug-dealing dictators.  Specifically and now disclosed since his incarceration Manuel Noriega but there are others.\n\n- U.S. support of death squad leaders, especially in Latin America.\n\n- Hoover's FBI denying that such a thing as the mafia existed until forced to admit it by Robert Kennedy, while the CIA had recruited its leaders to help overthrow Fidel Castro.  \n\n- Collaboration of Chamberlain with western banks with the fascist regimes before WWII in order destroy all forms of communism and socialism.\n\n- Apparent voter fraud in various US elections, most notably Bush 2000 and 2004, furthermore the admitted testing of the election infrastructure of several states by Homeland Security in 2016.\n\n- Apparent top level pedophile entrapment networks with potential ritual abuse.  See specifically the Dutroux Case in Europe.\n\n- 1999 Russian Apartment Bombings.\n\n- Control of the security services over the alternative media, including Coast to Coast AM, Alex Jones Show, Project Camelot, where you find conspiracy, you find former military intelligence officers.\n\n- Reality of the UFO phenomenon and the existence of more than the physical, in both cases without any power admitting to the details... Yet being hypersensitive in collecting data for military and investigative purposes.\n\n- Alliance between OSS & SS at the end of WWII that led to Paperclip, Geheln Organization, and other disclosed black weapons projects and possibly others.
Trump has filled his cabinet full of former Generals, sisters of Mercenary Captains, and appointees linked back to the American Security Council, AFIO, and the Jamestown Foundation.  The literal representation of the military to civilian industrial complex.\n\nI'm unsure of what may happen with the Russian threat with Trump but the Pacific Pivot is definitely going to heat up substantially.

Greer himself travels among a dozen factions of elites, look at his own writings and his constant stream of videos.  Better yet take a look at his work 'Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge' and reading the names and details you see a dossier of the military industrial complex who spent time destroying the Ufology community in the 70s to 90s.\n\nFeel free to check out ISGP's wonderful dossier on Greer and realize he is a plant:\n\nhttps://isgp-studies.com/ufo-disclosure-project-of-steven-greer\n\nNames in 'Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge' correlated with Real Names\nGeneral T.E. = Gen. Albert Stubblebine\nCol. MK  = Col. John Alexander\nW.B. = Robert Bigelow\t\nPrince S.A. = Hans Adam II von Liechtenstein\n\nIf you are worried about Rothschilds central banking or any of those pet issues around here you ought to be seriously concerned with Greer's dealings with Prince Hans Adams.  He isn't one of the good guys and is linked back\n\nStubblebine literally destroyed the UFO community in counter intelligence operations and has now been mucking up the 9-11 community as you can find at the link above.  Ask any old UFO researcher about Stubblebine's role in producing false documents, false leads, and generally causing chaos in the community.  Better yet google it.  It is hilarious to see him so freely quoted here in various 9-11 threads.
The Stratfor connection to InfoWars is real in their former editor, they employed an IT guy also named Alex Jones.  Possibly relation with his other admitted family members in military and civilian intelligence?\n\nJones employed a former Stratfor employee who also worked for Parkerhouse Media, a rumored CIA multi-media front, named Molly Maroney who was working on InfoWars magazine for several years before she was let go after a furor.\n\nLots of corporations and information firms are registered as user in Stratfor and if you look at the AnonHacks from Stratfor's members list you will find 1oldpath@infowars.net is a registered receiver of StratFor updates.\n\nStratfor is a private intelligence service also based in Austin, Texas, with a known Neo-Con and state of Israel slant.  They do some really good work on occasion but it does call into question his interests and even further links back to American intelligence services.\n\nJoel at ISGP has done some excellent research into the Alex Jones disinformation phenomenon that can be found here:\n\nhttps://isgp-studies.com/alex-jones-of-infowars-is-cia-army-disinformation.php\n\nFurthermore Jones is also tied to the Council of National Policy and the American Security Council, right wing intelligence and religious think tanks.\n\nYou can find the most updated available membership list for the CNP at:\n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf\n\nIt looks curiously like a list of Trump appointments or the appointments that Ted Cruz would have made if he would have been successful.  You will find such curious names as Major General John Singlelaub, Josh Duggar, Steve Bannon,  Kellyanne Conway, Jerome Corsi, and tons of other far right religious, political, military types.\n\nJones is agitation propaganda giving nuggets of truths wrapped in fecal sandwiches.
Dude your so right about the temps. On some of my older yihi mods I would have to vape at like 550+ to get a decent vape using Ti wire.

Poke thru Wikileaks, you will find nearly other major international player has a misdeed or three mentioned.

Mr. Chairman, I would also like to add that we have an extraordinary array of Rhodes Scholars here today. It seems to be a Mafia that has suddenly taken over the Administration. And as- I watched Senator Lugar praise Mr. Woolsey, I thought there was a connection there. Senator JOHNSTON. It's called the "Old Boy Network." Senator CHAFEE. That's right. I don't know what the secret, grip is, but -- [General laughter.] ... Senator KERREY of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - Ambassador Woolsey, you may have noted earlier that -I am not a Rhodes Scholar, and in fact many people in Nebraska-wonder how it is possible for me to serve on any Committee called the Intelligence Committee.

The preface of the book was written by Jacques Vallee, with Edgar Mitchell and Hal Puthoff praising the book. Having bought the book when I just started out with ISGP, I was not particular impressed.

May 23, 2013 upload, ThinkOutsideTheTV channel, 'Dying Ex-CIA Worker Comes Forward About Area 51 & Aleins [sic]' (Dolan is doing the interview and sometimes heavily leading the conversation): \n\n"I'm 77 right now. I can't live forever. ... I was drafted into the military and got into the U.S. Army. After that I was sent to the Signal Training Center... [in] '58... They pulled the top 5 students and I was third in the class, so I got pulled as an instructor. No, no [I was not yet working for the CIA]. After one day my boss came to me and he said: "How would like to make some extra money?" And I said: "Oh, money is good." So he explained to me he could put it through, but I would have to get a top secret white house Q-clearance. for the job, you know. And I thought: "Boy, must a pretty exclusive thing, you know." And I said: "Well, what it is this?" And he said that I'm director for the CIA of Eastern United States, you know. And I said: "Well, I didn't know that." So he said: "Well, you weren't supposed to." After about six weeks my security clearance came through and I got my CIA card. ... My name at that time, I used an artificial name. I never used my real name. I started working with him on the project he was on. And there was Project Blue Book, which was kind of partially a fraud. ... [can't pronounce the name of Fort Belvoir] ... My boss filled me in on Project Blue Book and what they had found so far, as far as greys and aliens and the Roswell incident. ... "Oh," he says, "we are going to the capital [on a new assignment]. We're going to be part of the Eisenhower push, who is trying to find out all about these aliens that MJ-12 was supposed to find out but never sent back reports to him. They called us in, went into the Oval Office. And President Eisenhower was there and Nixon and they said: "We called the people in from MJ-12 from Area 51 and S-4, but they told us that the government had no jurisdiction over what they were doing." ... So [Eisenhower] said: "I want you and your boss to fly out there and give them a personal message. I want you to tell them, whoever is charge, that they have this week to come into Washington and to report to me. And if they don't, I'm gonna get the First Army from Colorado and we're gonna go over and take the base over." ... They took us 13 to 14 miles south to S-4, where like different garage door openings [where] they had like different saucer crafts. The very first one had the Roswell craft in. It was kind of crashed up, but apparently every alien had died in it except a couple [sticks up two fingers]. ... Well, the Roswell craft was really strange, because it looked like real heavy aluminum foil. ... The whole thing probably weight 150-300 pounds. ... I guess that there are different types of greys and so on. Well, later on, at S-4, we viewed the autopsy film and then the colonel said: "What we've got in here is we're interviewing a grey alien." [Dolan: "Oh, right there, how were you feeling at that moment?] "Well, boy, I never thought we were going to see the real thing." All we saw [up until that point] was film. My boss was able to go in and have like a partial interview with him. This [alien] looked a little oriental. ... Eisenhower and Nixon were there and also [J. Edgar] Hoover was there [when we reported back]. ... We told [Eisenhower] about the alien and the whole situation and the black projects and so on, and he was totally shocked."\n\nSince 2012 he has his Richard Dolan Show at KGRA, where also the radio shows of MUFON and Above Top Secret forums are located, as well as Parascience Journal and a show of Coast to Coast AM veteran Micah Hanks. Guests of the show have included Linda Moulton Howe and Joseph Farrell.
The testimony with which Greer has gathered has been assisted and given, with only words, and nothing admissible in court.  Most of this information or these individuals with impeccable credentials mostly Major General Albert N. Stubblebine, by Greer's own admission.  The good Major General is suspect in several disinformation campaign which crippled the UFO movement and left Greer as the main beneficiary by the mid 90s.\n\nThe original poster has a lot of great truths hidden in here.  He did miss a major link to Antarctica and the Nazi UFO Mythos.  Dr. Greer has been recently touting that his next video will show actual camera footage from the Third Reich of the Nazi 'Bell' project.  Two continents of historians are literally awaiting to watch this footage.

His study of the Phoenix program started when he had access to first hand players and documentation before being cut off and it is revealing and eye opening to the actual conspiracies in our reality.

Old set of VHS tapes:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VbK1zLS1jA\n\nMena Connection, all about that and more.  You will curiously find Larry Nichols participating in this VHS and future sequels of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy chasing our old pal Hillary.  You may remember Nichols from such places as the Bill Copper conspiracy circuit in the 90's and much more recently appearing on the Alex Jones Show nearly weekly for the last two years.\n\nNichols after being terminated from being an Iran-Contra, teamed up with Pat Matrisciana to create two documentaries.  The Clinton Chronicles and Obstruction of Justice and both production have deep ties back to far right, former CIA officers or iofficers in the private employ of the Agency, along with think tanks that likely attempted to undermine the Clinton administration.\n\nPat Matrisciana, who has spoke at length about operating with the CIA and belongs to the Council for National Policy.  Look at the CNP’s membership list from 2014 from SPLC and see how much of Trump’s cabinet belong to that group.  Then google, “Pat Matrisciana”, the name plus CIA and you will see in our near past that Pat has apparently hinted around at being a CIA spy poking around internal and external far right Christian movements and reporting back to his handlers.\n\nCheck the latest scanned and publically sourced list:\n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf\n\nDuring the end of the cocaine fueled 1980s, you will find the CNP headed by Richard Mellon Scaife, and you may remember him from such plutocratic institutions as: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, Carthage Foundation, and Allegheny Foundation, the Scaife Family Foundation…  And was the direct heir of the Mellon family fortune, yes that Mellon family with the Carnegies that also has a large set of family trusts:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mellon_Scaife\n\nAt this point, Scaife had his hands all over international intelligence, there are several documents floating through CSIS that Kissinger, Woolsey, Brezezinski, and several Rothschild’s gave him recommendations to various intelligence agencies as man to know in business.\n\nCuriously enough, Scaife is also the titular head of that vast right-wing Conspiracy that Hillary was ranting about and his minions are in the high employee of Trump:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/meet-the-new-bossie-same-as-the-old-bossie/498698/\n\nSo, we have our new President elected, who with the support of Nichols, and the implicit support of the what was left of Scaife’s fortune after his death… Also being promoted by the new head of Conspiracyland in the post 9-11 World, Alex Jones, also having his own ties back to the Council for National Policy, the American Security Council and these same right-wing former intelligence types.  Find the youtube clips where calls ask Alex about either of these groups…. \n\nWe have real conspiracies all around us that do not require aliens, demonic entities, and pizza.  Unless they are the ones pointing them out to us!\n
That is even more horrifying that their grammar standards have been lowered since 1945.  :)
Agreed, at this point his whole situation is evidence of sheep dipping so he can back later and spin some other disclosure on a sensitive topic to conspiracy researchers everywhere... \n\n"I had the documents man!

My favorite episode and can still remember watching it the first time it came on and seeing Lord Kinbote.
"Newt Gingrich, an influential adviser to Trump when it comes to space issues, is among those pushing for a more entrepreneurial space program. In an email to The Washington Post, Gingrich, who said he was on a trip to Antarctica, blasted NASA for becoming an agency that avoids risk, and said the space program should leverage the enthusiasm and money of the many billionaires interested in commercializing space."

I'm more curious about how this wing of our national intelligence apparatus imported James Jesus Angleton's full on alliance with Mossad and the state of Israel into their fold.  Considering their intelligence proclivities, John Luftus in his, "The Secret War Against the Jews" is an interesting historical take on this while he masks his own agendas and allegiances.\n\nThe recently declassified 'Studies in Intelligence' biography of William Colby goes into a bit of detail on this before [REDACTED] for pages at a time on the subject.  \n\nIt was a full-on, curious mix of Christian beliefs, MacArthurs, anti-Semites attempting to bring on Christian Prophecy, former Paperclip-Operation Condor Nazis, and the state of Israel.  Albeit the concoction has been mixed up as the old guard died and inheritors moved into place.\n\nOur choice has boiled down to Wall-Street Fascists or the Radical Christian Fascists as they fight for control of our national intelligence apparatus.

Goode spent several years during the start of his UFOlogy career moonlighting in the Texas National Guard in intelligence as his MOS.   Albeit it was specifically in information system technologies and supposedly not regular intelligence work.  I would be very curious what the security checks with the Army were looking like as he was secretly breaking into army bases and leaking secrets.\n\nWilcock is linked backed financially to the Edgar Cayce Society.  He has alternatively presented himself as the "reincarnation" of Edgar Cayce and the God "Ra-Ta" who allegedly built the Great Pyramid.  He describes this experience in his magisterial work with Wynn Free,  'The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce', which is a mismatch of Cayce prophecy and new age thoughts and feelings. 
Which is why this basic outline it is going to get lost in the signal to noise ratio in the middle of the 'Great Spook War'.  All the signs and facts are there and both sides are traitors to basic human rights and American principles.
Listen to some of his shorter lectures on Youtube if you have not already.  He was in no way a saint but he had a ton of interesting ideas that crossed multiple disciplines.

Vice magazine has always been a neo-liberal mouth piece look at who has stakes in the company.\n\nMurdoch is already listed several times in this thread but also Disney through the AE sub corporation:\n\nH2 – which focuses on the culture and history of countries throughout the world from a local perspective. In November 2015, A&E acquired a 9% ownership interest in Vice Media (Vice) in exchange for a 49.9% interest in H2, which will be rebranded with Vice content. Vice is a media company targeting a millennial audience through edgy news, pop culture content and creative brand integration.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001039/000100103915000255/fy2015_q4x10k.htm\n\nYou can fall further down the rabbit hole, Vice is controlled opposition for the antebellum world order.\n\nJust search for Vice Media through the SEC filings and see that it has only been a counterculture hipster rag masquerading for the neo-liberal interregnum.

PCR is all over the place but this interpretation seems pretty spot on since we are now using special ops more openly in Yemen in the Saudi's War.  Trump did not dial that notch back and ask the Saudis about those 19 hijackers...
Podesta is highly interested in releasing the "truth" about UFO sightings per several easily found documented articles, Twitter comments, and communications with Maureen Dowd at the NYT.\n\nDelonge has recently been peddling a set of stories from a book that came out in spring 2016 called, "Chasing Shadows" that settles itself borrowing from occult circles, Nazi UFO mythos.  He is apparently supported by some vague group of military industrial complex "insiders" - Mccasland was rumored to be one of them on some open source intelligence sites.\n\nDelonge is supported by a lot of Coast to Coast regulars with questionable motives and research but mainly Peter Levenda who wrote the prologue to his current book.\n\nDelonge also has made some deleted Twitter posts that he was meeting Bill Clinton and Podesta for a meeting about his "project".\n\nThere is actual documented evidence that some of our Paperclip scientists were working on jet propelled saucers but the icky that Delonge is peddling mucks up the waters.\n
Excellent investigation, really appreciate all of the documentation!

This happens several days after the new administration and officials has already gotten their real briefings.  While domestically this administration is a leaking sieve unable by Congress and their own internal turmoil to root domestic leaks.  Our history of back and forth defections proves the other side always has someone in your group, they always do, and then the evidence gets to the wrong hands.  Then those people... wind up in prison or Siberia.
Both of those scenes are two of my favorite in all of my TV viewing.\n
There is the more traditional liberal wing of the CIA.  Following in the Dulles tradition and in that spectrum you can find Obama, Clinton, Bush presidencies inheritors and protectors of the post-cold war status quo for Wall Street interests.\n\nOn the other side of this divide you will find people like Major General John Singlelaub, original member of the OSS, CIA, who is still throwing his weight around with such group as the Council for National Policy and the American Security Council despite being in his 90's.  This is considered the more traditional Conservative wing of the CIA who have variously supported groups like InfoWars, the Militia movement, Christian Identity politics, and various other right wing counter culture organizations.  Look at the members list.... \n\nThe Trump presidency is the literal inheritors of Council of National Policy:\n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf\n\nSo in a way, yes, the comments by Steve Pieczenik about a counter coup are indeed correct... but partially untruthfully.  You will find you get immediately shot down by the Alex Jones of the conspiracy world once you begin mentioning the CNP and ASC.    \n\nWonder why Alex Jones is always mentioning his relatives in intelligence...

The flotsam ejection reminds me of the Fred Crisman and the Maury Island event desciption.  Even though I'm sure and research has proved that likely did not happen as reported but that event of itself is linked back to every intelligence agency in this country and eventually to Operation Paperclip by Crisman.
Roger: With Hilary's recent revelations about UFO disclosure - do you know if The Donald shares any similar feelings about unidentified aerial vehicles and disclosing them to the public?
The link to the honorable James Woolsey no matter the turn of events is disturbing in the UFO community.  A director of a former agency which has released entire reams of documentation that they subverted an investigative community over the course of several decades should be anathema to that community.  \n\nI side on the fact that they are indeed friendly as displayed by the facts of both sides despite the various and conflicting letters over the years.  Which is the entirety of the point, Woolsey is well known in the intelligence community for continuing his work into alternative subjects after his term as director.  Greer is possibly one of these projects as he has ties directly to Woolsey, a Rockefeller and Hans Adam von Lichtenstein.  If anyone else in a conspriacy community had direct links back to those gentlemen, there would be fifteen threads devoted to their "shilling".  The fact Greer is still claiming disclosure is imminent every few months while selling videos, t-shirts, and other rad-merchandise since the mid-nineties is a testament to his ultimate goals.
Invasions and pressure from Eurasia through the disorder.\n\nEconomic troubles, wealth concentration, and over reliance on cheap to near slave labor has left the West without means of production.  The police state is rolled out as a dystopian way of protecting the elites from the hoi polloi when they realize they have no place in their automated future.\n\nThe rise of eastern states such as China, India, Brazil, and the reassertion of Russia in the world order.  Their alliances systems  challenge regional and international hegemony means the redrawing of maps and trade agreements.  The assistance of these powers between themselves in order to challenge the current world order remains the Great Game.  Side with China in a desperate attempt to maintain hegemony or Russia?\n\nOver expansion, military overspending, the inability to fight off those threats unless two or more of them is coopted fully into the Western sphere.  Every dollar spent on defense is a dollar not spent on developing the technologies that would get us off-world and to the vast resources of an interstellar civilization.\n\nGovernment corruption, military corruption and interference and political instability leads to the last gasps of representative democracy and back to the natural Hobbesian state of autocracy.\n\nNihilism remains true north for philosophy of the Post-Post-Modern epoch.  Yet the chaos and lack of ideas leads to a new technocratic ordering that merges Asian collectivism with Nazi era inspired DNA policies that would inspire Heinrich Himmler... ex nihilo nihil fit.  A nightmare Thomas Hobbes would recognize.\n\nOr you know... just nuclear annihilation and roving bands of autocratic warlords.  A nightmare Thomas Hobbes would recognize.
Nice, keep me informed on that. Definitely want to try it when you release it.

Yeah it was weird. Eddie was like talking down to Alex, acting like he knew some shit Alex didn't.
Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce and Ra according to his own works, furthermore he has deep ties back to the Cayce foundation supporting his writing and multimedia projects.  His and Goode's information is some of the most useless in the Coast to Coast and Ancient Aliens milieu.  It is usually tinged with attempting to justify one of Cayce's prophecies or beliefs.  \n\nHung around at the fringes of EC group over the years to study how he tricked the elites of his day and looking at several MI officials dragged in over the years...   I have a hilarious speculation they are attempting to influence reality through belief and consensus to make their prophecies reality.   They are obsessed with correcting the record at historical "inaccuracies" in his prophecies or with his revelations on the pyramids, Antarctica, and Atlantis.  A shame Cayce was an interesting guy and high functioning occultist.  At least we are only burning certain occultist at the stake here at the moment.

I enjoy my current setup .\n\nXcube ultra with goblin mini v2 with wide bore delrin tip with adjustable airflow.
What shit is our president pulling? Please enlighten me? I'll wait for you to link a msm hit piece that provides exactly no proof or evidence and is nothing more than speculations on the part of the corrupt MSM.
I really want this. I vape 3 but it just doesn't feel satisfying at all. I ordered 6mg from Roman haze to see if it would satisfy me, it did but it was unexpectedly harsh. I tried other 6mg juices and they didn't have the same harshness. So I'm thinking I could get 100mg nic salt and start making 6mg blends so i still feel satisfied without the harshness on the throat. Figures it's sold out.
Come on man, at least tree fiddy.
Smok xcube ultra. Tc works good and it's like 55$
If I was a winner, could I choose to pay extra to try out the nic salt liquid?
Thanks jimbo 
Strawberry milk and super cereal.
Honestly, it's tough to say. Vapesocietysupplies is run by the old "ejuicemafia" company. Many Many people have had issues with them and pretty much no one who is on the sub a lit would order from them.\n\nI suggest you do a search of ejuicemafia and make your own conclusion from there.
Yeah, I know I won't ever be ordering from them.
Isn't there some kind of cheap kit you can buy to test the level of nicotine in the juice? Forget what it's called but I've heard other people speak of it. I will summon thee /u/abdada as when I am unsure of something, I ask him cause he pretty smart with this stuff.
I actually thought the same thing. The couple most recent times I got nuts and cream it tasted pretty different than it did the first time. Still good, just different than what I remember. The first couple bottles of nuts and cream I had were amazing. They next few were good but seemed different than the original.
Nothing, I'm single.

TIL Moby is a celebrity. Haha\n\nIf he has so called "intelligence", it means other people do too and it would have leaked already. America is run on fear porn. Its almost like all MSM does is try to keep everyone afraid of all the boogeymen around the world, when in reality they occupy the offices of our government. Hopefully the Donald is genuine and is really going to try to expose all the nonsense that is our government. Too early to tell for me. He's an elite but I really don't believe he's in that tight knit circle of the really fucked up elite. The way the whole election played out, NO ONE who matters wanted him to win, it was Hillary's turn but the democrats plan blew up in their faces.\n\nNow it's all. "Scary Russia" and "scary Trump"\n\n
No, actually Obama did that with the NDAA.
That's replacing something bad with something worse. Early studies show vaping to be far less harmful than smoking. Whole different ballgame.
Wtf. Haha
No my point stands correct as Obama is the one who gave the government the power to do basically whatever they want, not trump. Whether trump repeals it is null and void, *Obama*  is the one who issued the power in the first place, which was the point of my original comment.
I don't mean this to be a dick, but you really can't guarantee anything. You don't know podesta or his weird friends. Just cause people in your office send non pedo emails about food has absolutely nothing to do with podesta and the other weirdos involved. Pedophilia among people in power is nothing new, as we have seen over and over and over again. Point is, podesta and alefantis don't work with you and you dont know them at all, so I don't see how your guarantee holds any weight. And like I said, I'm bot trying to insult you or start shit with you, just pointing out some things.
I understand that but letting sessions go after legal weed is really really counterproductive of trumps whole supposed agenda. I think trump himself said marijuana should be an issue of that states, not the federal government. Hopefully sessions has some more important shit to do than go after legal weed.
Everybody likes to knock Jones, but he does know his shit. Personally I like to listen watch AJ but if there's one thing I hate is how he always interrupts the people he's talking to. As soon as they start talking Jones always interrupts them, prolly just cause he knows so much shit and already knows what they're going to say. Other than that I like Jones. I don't buy into him being disinformation, he's still the same dude he always was except he's gotten bigger which I think is a good thing. He's a crazy bastard, but his core message since he started was trying to expose government criminals and for America to be free and prosperous .\n\n\n"But he sells vitamins! He's a snake oil salesman"\n\nNo, vitamins are good for you.\n\n"But he sells water filters!! What a money grabber!!!"\n\nDo you drink tap water? Do you not think everyone should filter their water with a good filter?\n\nI think a lot of these negative theories about Jones (disinfo) were probably started by the government and pushed on online forums. I mean come on and be real, if you were part of some criminal element of the government and Jones starts getting nosey would you not think it would be a good idea to push negative theories about him among conspiracy groups to discredit him? I would.\n\nConspiracy theorists should embrace Jones and all other conspiracy theorists who actually spit truth because whether they are right or wrong, they get people to start asking questions, and we all know what that leads to. That's why most of us are here.
It is, just ignore Eddie bravo. Usually he's fun to have around but he was being quite annoying during this show.

No way man. A lot of his campaign was run on creating jobs for Americans. Be realistic, he's not going to let sessions kill a multibillion dollar a year industry and growing that employs thousands of people in multiple states. Not gonna happen.

So a few people in my family are quite wealthy, my uncle is actually pretty close to becoming a billionaire. I'm poor as fuck though.

Tbh, none of us know for sure. It could be a massive pedo ring of powerful people, or some gibberish in an email. I tend to believe there is a pedo ring of elites only because it's happened in the past, multiple times. These people aren't like us, they don't follow the same laws we do. Elites think because of their status, they can do whatever they want. Sadly in America, and most other countries money buys freedom, which in turn gives them the green light to do whatever.

https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0\n\nsimple google search shows this is a lie.
I guess we will have to disagree. I find it insulting that he continued to lie about the Benghazi attack being about a video when he knew otherwise. I also find it insulting he paid Iran a ransom and then had the same free press you mention  lie for him and deflect. I find the fact he used the same free press use propaganda against the American people far riskier than what Trump says on Twitter. 
The timing of the donations is irrelevant. When she recieved the money makes no real difference on whether she was acting with a conflict of interest. \n\nThey don't seem to mention both Bill and Frank going to Khazakstan during the deal negotiations. \n\nNor do they discuss the involvement Troika Dialog (now sberbank CIB) in the deal: a known Kremlin proxy. 
Notice who is behind Shillary?
This story was actually broken by The New York Times.
Wow the deep state existed before the election even? Still waiting for a source showing Soros owns Snopes. When you are challenged all you do is deflect. First I say you never post pro-Bernie, you are a Trumptard. You say, check my gilded posts. I do, nothing there. I say that, you don't respond, just DV. Then I post 3 pro-Trump posts from this week alone you posted and ask if Bernie would agree and you don't respond. I ask for source on Soros owning Snopes you don't respond. But evidently the "deep state" controlled CNBC, Vox, Snopes, Politifact and Factcheck when it appeared like Clinton would win the election. Want to explain that? You are an addled brain conspiracy fool that can never admit you are wrong is the explanation. Have you ever admitted you are wrong on here? After all, you have made literally hundreds of posts saying things were going to happen that never happened yet you never addressed how wrong you or the posts were it seems. Why not? You just throw conspiracy garbage out here as fast as you can find it for the votes and move on to the next thing. You even post stuff that disagrees with what you posted the week before without even acknowledging it and seemingly unaware that you have done it because you are just bombarding everyone with it.\n\nEdit: Quit hiding with a DV and answer. Don't you have have any shame? Or when you are confronted with your BS do you just run and hide every time or say "deep state" or CTR or some other deflection?  Are you just psychologically incapable of telling the truth? \n\nAlso it's "You know that Snopes is owned by Soros, **don't** you?" \n\nAnd it's "**Do you** understand that all these references are ~~only~~ laughable Deep State propaganda?"\n\nYou need to work on your English comrade.

You know that Snopes is owned by Soros, do you?
No she is making a point. You failed her by not going to Dollar Tree and picking up a card. She is being petty. 
I can't wait. I love Alex's rants. 
Well this is fucking weird 
I  start reading r/JUSTNOMIL at about 10 and most of them are so long I start getting drowsy. 
Only because we love Liv and Fitz is a petty little bitch.

I don't care who votes for who but I think it should be off limits at family functions. She has a problem w/feminists but not gay BIL?  I'm more conservative than most people who post here but I love gay people and I'm more than pro feminist, she just sounds like a mean old hag.   I think she just has a problem with you.\n\n Your husband is going to have to be much stronger advocating for you.  Don't let your kid stay there while you vacation.  She will pull all sorts of mind control on him, she will convince him that you left him for some reason. If you give her no power then she has nothing on you. Your husband needs to end this shit. 
Bad Haircut Gang 
I made myself stop reading. I just can't anymore. I think I'm IP banned, even comments I make agreeing no longer show up. I commented that I use to enjoy the site but the over the top venom and the echo chamber is off putting.  \n\nThe Kate Middleton stories are so ridiculous, they somehow think William & Kate are withholding the kids from poor Prince Charles. Seriously have they forgotten some of the shit he has done? The also treat Prince Phillip like a sweet old grandpa, when in reality he is a long time racist asshole.  Ya are William and Kate are lazy, but what the hell are the commenters doing? It seems like they spend hours a day in their echo chamber. I think the writers at Celebitchy have a lot of nerve calling people out about work. They act like they are digging ditches or healing the blind while W&K are standing by waving.  \n\n
Don't believe anything with the word official. That's just a word to make lies believable
Ok so get cracking dude all I've heard is there are going to be delays. 
Then your wife needs to chill, Trump said they let you, last time I checked letting someone do something isn't assault. Men say tons of stupid shit when they are together, I guess it's fortunate that u don't since u have a wife who "frown" upon it. 
I think u are right. I think she has some of this stuff sent to her 
She's fat? Am I looking the same blog? Blonde hair? Wore a plaid skirt in one of the pics? 
I'm a woman  and I have enough sense to know that men bullshit each other. 
When does he get a lawyer? 
So I've been meaning to tell u 
I missed where your mom knows. Then I wouldn't worry about it too much. My dad doesn't pay enough attention to realize the dates are off but if your mom knows then that is good
Exactly this 
Go kill Carol and use it as ammunition to talk the Tiger tamer into going to war 
He didn't disrespect you, he was looking for an easy way out. Just act like nothing is up, don't confront him because there is nothing to confront. Be cool about it. 
I can see why you are confused.  Maybe start seeing some other guys and see what happens. The 3 day sex, food, tv marathon is confusing af. He may be the type that pays attention to what is right in front of him? 
Do u think this was the first time? I'm sure people get through all the time. There is probably something planned or in the works and it will go back to this. 
You might need to go to your area community college and talk to their career office. They can point u in the right direction 
We have a bulldog too. He is so sweet but bless his heart he just isn't smart (that's putting it nicely.)  My cat hides and jumps out at him as he comes down the hall, he falls for it every single time. You are so right they would be a great stoner dog. He comes back from the groomers and sleeps the rest of the weekend. 
The fact he is still on the dating app is a pretty good indication he is talking to or seeing other girls.  I don't think he is into this for a serious relationship. Yes he could have texted. \n\nHe is several years older than you and should have more discretion about who he has unprotected sex with. Please don't have unprotected sex with him. If he did it so quickly with you he is doing it that quickly with others.  
Does she have a CrimeStoppers line to call with tips? Does the reward hinge on her actually being able to send them a sternly worded Facebook message?
Where's the proof?  There are thousands of emails proving all the shady shit Hillary did, all I've seen as evidence on Russia is the MSM saying it happened. 
And CNN doesn't spread hoaxes? 
Off topic but this just reminded me. An Asian restaurant in my town was closed down this week because the health dept found rat feces on utensils, cock roaches on cutting boards, and get this actual stray cats wandering the restaurant. They said they let the cats in to kill the rats, seems legit. I never ate there but everyone who went there  loved it, I vomit in my mouth thinking about it. 
Tara: did I mention this pack of lesbians I know with a full arsenal? 
I think you should stop asking for relationship defining talks.  I'm afraid you aren't going to like what he says or you will over analyze it. It's only a month in, go with it, don't try to force definitions.  If he is spending tons of time with you logistically he doesn't have much time to have sex with other girls. I knew when my husband when I got serious we hung out Friday and Saturday nights. Sometimes we deviated but not often. If he is availability both nights most of the time he isn't dating seriously anyone else. 
I refuse to carry a cheap purse, I like designer bags but for clothes Target all the way. Everyone has their thing, shoes, clothes, jewelry, or bags. 
Fuck this guy and his faux humanity. 
I love him. He's great on the Patriot channel in the mornings 
Rick always out hustlin 
Good Luck Richard trying to kill Carol. She will reach into your chest and rip out your heart, even through the body armor 
 Then they would also need to verify that what Tom said was true and have more than Tom's word that Cyrus ordered him to do it. The whole thing is a hot mess 
Sup I'm Rick 
Not at all. I am "cough" kind of passive aggressive so when I see it in others I recognize it. 
Nope but at least if u recognize it and actively try not to. I mean we aren't walking into to Target and leaving with a Barbie Dreamhouse but she will weasel something out of me. It's more an issue of me not her. 
The reason we have conspiracies is politics, money, and sex. 
Turning on the tv doesn't mean they will be glued to it. Most of the time kids will play while the tv is in the background. 
Can't stand Bill O'Reilly. Use to love him then heard he lied in his killing Kennedy about the ending and I found that off putting \n\nWolf Blitzer looks like a nervous wreck all the time, like someone is going to find out he is a hack. Which of course he is\n\nThat Sally something on CNN the poor mans Rachel Maddow. She's terrible\n\nAlso dislike\nBill Kristol\nGlen Beck \nAndrea Mitchell\nMartha Radiz (spelling) \nVan Jones\nMatt Lauer after he pulled some fact check bullshit last week on Trump which he never did with Obama. \n\n\nI like Tucker, Hannity, cough Alex Jones cough let's not mention that again. \n\nI listen to Breibart in the morning. Use to love Stephen K Bannon in the mornings, now they have Alex Marlowe. I don't like Marlowe much he's kind of a know it all, don't like Matt Boyle much he stutters a lot. Last week they had on Lee Stranahan and I liked him. Savage is good too. 
Haven't listened to them in awhile. Has their audio gotten better?  I felt like I was listening to a couple of guys I couldn't understand all the time at 100 yards away 
Who's watching Judith? 
My cat waits in the window and watches my driveway for me to get home. My brother stayed here a week while I was on vacation and he said cat was pissed the whole time. 
Why the fuck is Don Draper doing taxes
If Carol wakes up and steps on a Lego, I will kill you 
The absence of Jake is pretty huge. Jake is always getting into shit he's like a little kid who is quiet\n
You made a mistake get out now. You are only 29. This isn't a marriage this another kid for you to raise. \n\nAre these kids permanently yours? Are you getting social security etc? You need to figure this kid situation out and go back to a place you have support. Your creepy husband hit on your friend, it's embarrassing but not your fault. You need friends now. 
I have all those diagnoses too except the eating disorder. What do they tell you to do for the other things?  My therapist keeps telling me to tell myself it's all going to be ok. I do it and then something bad happens and I think I've jinxed myself by not expecting the bad. 
O'Reilly talked about Pizzagate one night. Of course he dismissed it as a witch hunt against Hillary and only crazy people believe it. 
That's an excellent theory.  
Is the guard Riggins brother from FNL? Is that where I've seen him? 
I feel like Lori could have beat this girls ass 
You might still be numb. I had a tummy tuck (much worse than c-section) in 2010 and a C-Section in 2012, there are still parts of my stomach I don't totally feel. \n\nDid they say anything about sciatica? 
This is exactly right but the NeverTrumpers and the John McCain faction of the Republican party is holding on for dear life. The only way they think they can survive is act like liberals. They are terrified of being labeled and being dragged through the mud by the media. 
Honey Boo Boo was like 8 when her show was on. Being ordered to perform by your parents isn't lacking self esteem 
So are these like Jehovah Witnesses 
We have one daughter and I use to feel so guilty for not giving her a sibling. Then I thought of all the advantages she has, she gets to do whatever extra curricular activity she wants since we aren't shuffling schedules and money, she doesn't have to share her stuff, there is no fighting for mom and dads attention.  Not having a sibling has had no impact on her social skills or her ability to play in a group.  When she's ready for college she won't hear that we can't afford to send you and all your siblings. \n\nAt the same time though it's easy for them to become spoiled. When parents are in the 30s and money isn't an issue you tend to want to give them anything they want. Trips to Disney sure why not, the 40.00 lego set just because sure again, oh it's Tuesday and u need a new bicycle why not. My husband doesn't spoil her but I do. I'm trying to stop, I'm getting better since I recognize it now and I know it's not doing her any favors. 
Obama was far from reasonable, remember elections have consequences, Obama shoved his radical alt-left agenda down our throats for 8 years.  I'm sorry you are literally shaking 
Ok we cool now? 
Hand wringing about short clips that have been around forever. Sanctimonious literally shaking b.s. 
This is absurd. Both of you are not ready to be married. Just stop and get out now. 
Dangerous rhetoric? I would rather hear the truth about what is going on than be bullshitted like the previous administrations. \n\nThe media is a pack of degenerate liars who are actively working to brainwash you and your family. They repeat the same lies over and over until the public takes it as fact. 
Magda lost her ever loving fucking mind. Omg 
Are u serious?  Trust what the government tells you?  Did u ever hear the story of the wmds? 
If he didn't say bad things about her then how did it help Trump?  If her staff was singing her praises it wouldn't have helped him but the fact is they talked shit.  And blah blah Russia. 
Yes it's there. It's impossible to be just a little pregnant, it's either yes or no! 
Let's just go get Carol, piss her off, then let her take out Negans crew 
I take medication and it's amazing the difference.
And super male vitality and brain force. 
My dad is Jeff and my brother is Jeffrey. I've never seen any confusion or nicknames 
I'm torn on the vaccine thing. I mean ya I do think there is bad stuff in them messing people up. But we don't have polio and other diseases anymore. So what to do? Take your chances on the vaccine or take your chances on other diseases? 
How long have you been in therapy? If it's not working get a new therapist. Let your therapist guide you in what you tell your partner. My therapist tells me sone things are no one else's business and if I don't want to tell them don't. That was a huge burden lifted off of me. I don't have to tell my deepest darkest to anyone and I'm ok with that. 
I get that the mom was molested and she is a victim, but come on why have your daughter there with him alone? At some point the protection instinct has to kick in. This is a very very sick dynamic. 
What happens down the road when your kids ask how old u were when you got married or how long you were married before you had them. I know you have your reasons for not telling the truth, I think you are setting yourself up for something down the road. The truth will get out. 
Wait I know I left the mouse someplace by the keyboard 
I know. I was trying to be somewhat nice. I think it's all kinds of fucked up and she should be held responsible for what he did to her daughter. 
So he can't say drugs are the enemy, child abuse is an enemy, or overeating is an enemy because it then will cause wars?  You are being extreme 
Right. You totally would. This is why people ask advice it's so complicated and tricky. Please post what happens after the talk, I want to know what he says. 
Have u tried paying for some things? 100.00 a month in rent? It's not much but it's good intentions 
I thought Glenn Beck was drying out or at a fat farm or something,I guess he crawled out from under his rock to try to stay relevant
I always wonder though how much moms keep from dads. I tell my husband stuff and make him swear not to tell after I tell my daughter I won't tell dad. But there are some things that I just don't mention to him. 
My 5 year old seems to twerk so it doesn't seem off that the POTUS would too 
Abbey had something to do with this, she wouldn't be trying so hard 
Since when did Daryl become the social one? He's working the neighborhood 
I like the curtains. The gray looks great 
unlike what you want me to believe I am a woman living in 2017 and I have choices. My choice is to say fuck you CNN
Was Dick Cheney the Vice President? Is the Vice President the government?  I totally blame him but there are operatives and loyalist littered all through government 
Ok say they were lifting the sanctions. So. Are we supposed to believe the narrative about big bad Russia making Hillary Clinton a crook therefore people didn't vote for her?  
Uh shouldn't Cyrus have known to get a bad ass lawyer and been all over this? 
Because the Trump presidency is just one big gift to his rich friends.
Most rich elites feel nothing but absolute contempt for the poor

Excerpts from Ummat interview with OBL:               \n               \nUmmat: You have been accused of involvement in the attacks in New York and Washington. What do you want to say about this? If you are not involved, who might be?               \n               \nUsamah: In the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful. Praise be to Allah, Who is the creator of the whole universe and Who Made the earth as an abode for peace, for the whole mankind. Allah is the Sustainer, who sent Prophet Muhammad for our guidance. I am thankful to The Ummat Group of Publications, which gave me the opportunity to convey my viewpoint to the people, particularly the valiant and Momin [true Muslim] people of Pakistan who refused to believe in lie of the demon. I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people. Such a practice is forbidden ever in the course of a battle. It is the United States, which is perpetrating every maltreatment on women, children, and common people of other faiths, particularly the followers of Islam. All that is going on in Palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of God upon the United States and Israel. There is also a warning for those Muslim countries, which witnessed all these as a silent spectator. What had earlier been done to the innocent people of Iraq, Chechnya, and Bosnia? Only one conclusion could be derived from the indifference of the United States and the West to these acts of terror and the patronage of the tyrants by these powers that America is an anti-Islamic power and it is patronizing the anti-Islamic forces. Its friendship with the Muslim countries is just a show, rather deceit. By enticing or intimidating these countries, the United States is forcing them to play a role of its choice. Put a glance all around and you will see that the slaves of the United States are either rulers or enemies [of Muslims].               \n               \nThe US has no friends, nor does it want to keep any because the prerequisite of friendship is to come to the level of the friend or consider him at par with you. America does not want to see anyone equal to it. It expects slavery from others. Therefore, other countries are either its slaves or subordinates. However, our case is different. We have pledged slavery to God Almighty alone and after this pledge there is no possibility to become the slave of someone else. If we do that, it will be disregardful to both our Sustainer and his fellow beings. Most of the world nations upholding their freedom are the religious ones, which are the enemies of United States, or the latter itself considers them as its enemies. Or               \n               \nThe countries, which do not agree to become its slaves, such as China, Iran, Libya, Cuba, Syria, and the former Russia [as received]. Whoever committed the act of 11 September are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people, whereas in these attacks, the common American people have been killed. According to my information, the death toll is much higher than what the US government has stated. But the Bush administration does not want the panic to spread. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system, but are dissenting against it. Or those who are working for some other system; persons who want to make the present century as a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity so that their own civilization, nation, country, or ideology could survive. They can be any one, from Russia to Israel and from India to Serbia. In the US itself, there are dozens of well-organized and well-equipped groups, which are capable of causing a large-scale destruction. Then you cannot forget the American Jews, who are annoyed with President Bush ever since the elections in Florida and want to avenge him. Then there are intelligence agencies in the US, which require billions of dollars worth of funds from the Congress and the government every year. This [funding issue] was not a big problem till the existence of the former Soviet Union but after that the budget of these agencies has been in danger. They needed an enemy. So, they first started propaganda against Usamah and Taleban and then this incident happened. You see, the Bush administration approved a budget of 40bn dollars. Where will this huge amount go? It will be provided to the same agencies, which need huge funds and want to exert their importance. Now they will spend the money for their expansion and for increasing their importance. I will give you an example. Drug smugglers from all over the world are in contact with the US secret agencies. These agencies do not want to eradicate narcotics cultivation and trafficking because their importance will be diminished. The people in the US Drug Enforcement Department are encouraging drug trade so that they could show performance and get millions of dollars worth of budget. General Noriega was made a drug baron by the CIA and, in need, he was made a scapegoat. In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other US president, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United Sates? That secret government must be asked as to who made the attacks.               \n               \nUmmat: A number of world countries have joined the call of the United States for launching an attack on Afghanistan. These also include a number of Muslim countries. Will Al-Qa’idah declare a jihad against these countries as well?               \n               \nUsamah: I must say that my duty is just to awaken the Muslims; to tell them as to what is good for them and what is not. What does Islam says and what the enemies of Islam want? Al-Qa’idah was set up to wage a jihad against infidelity, particularly to encounter the onslaught of the infidel countries against the Islamic states. Jihad is the sixth undeclared element of Islam. [The first five being the basic holy words of Islam, prayers, fast, pilgrimage to Mecca, and giving alms] Every anti-Islamic person is afraid of it. Al-Qa’idah wants to keep this element alive and active and make it part of the daily life of the Muslims. It wants to give it the status of worship. We are not against any Islamic country nor we consider a war against an Islamic country as jihad. We are in favour of armed jihad only against those infidel countries, which are killing innocent Muslim men, women, and children just because they are Muslims. Supporting the US act is the need of some Muslim countries and the compulsion of others. However, they should think as to what will remain of their religious and moral position if they support the attack of the Christians and the Jews on a Muslim country like Afghanistan. The orders of Islamic shari’ah [jurisprudence] for such individuals, organizations, and countries are clear and all the scholars of the Muslim brotherhood are unanimous on them. We will do the same, which is being ordered by the Amir ol-Momenin [the commander of the faithful] Mola Omar and the Islamic scholars. The hearts of the people of Muslim countries are beating with the call of jihad. We are grateful to them.               \n               \nUmmat: The losses caused in the attacks in New York and Washington have proved that giving an economic blow to the US is not too difficult. US experts admit that a few more such attacks can bring down the American economy. Why is al-Qa’idah not targeting their economic pillars?               \n               \nUsamah: I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is simply that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid by them. So, the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the US is not uttering a single word.               \n               \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20020111073623/http://www.khilafah.com/1421/category.php?DocumentID=2392

The issue I have with Trump's attacks is that the term "fake news" is incorrectly applied to MSM. It's a gross over-simplification.                 \n               \nIMO MSM is controlled by global elites, and important stories are suppressed or stories that promote their agenda are pushed. But it's not primarily faked.                \n             \nAnother problem with MSM is that some outlets are clearly partisan, with Fox pushing the right wing agenda, MSNBC pushing the left wing agenda, and CNN stuck in the middle being battered senseless by both sides.

first: i am not a doctor. i am fascinated by the human body and i remembered in the past finding out about "broken heart syndrome" and being amazed it was a real thing. it happens in postmenopausal women whom experience a significant loss or extremely stressful event. it also is more likely to happen to someone with a heart condition. it's safe to assume an 80 year old woman is postmenopausal. it is also safe to assume seeing your child die is an extremely stressful event. as her daughter died of a heart attack, another assumption one could make is perhaps some sort of heart condition/disease runs in the family. i theorize she experienced broken heart syndrome which lead to cardiogenic shock. a symptom of cardiogenic shock can be decreased blood flow to the brain. strokes are caused by an interruption of blood flow to the brain. the cardiogenic shock from her broken heart created the stroke that killed her. unless some sort of evidence can be provided that would give elites/illuminati/nwo/etc a reason to want her or her daughter dead, i think it's safe to chalk this one up as nonconspiratorial.\n\nhttp://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Real_UCM_448547_Article.jsp#mainContent
this is interesting especially given the recent news that they have now developed a more accurate screening process for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is similar to kuru and can also be acquired through cannibalism. this is weird because Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is fairly rare. they say this screening may help with alzheimer's and parkinson's but there is no proof either of those are prion diseases. it is all very strange and makes the original post's claim even more interesting.\n\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-test-spots-human-form-of-mad-cow-disease-with-100-percent-accuracy/#

this has been going on for a long time. it is why the heroin epidemic is where it is at today. doctors in the late 90s/early 00s were handing out OCs like candy then were pressured to stop which led to an increase in pharmacy robberies because they were not getting the drug prescribed. this led to armed security in the pharmacies and a decrease in robberies and an increase in heroin addictions. purdue pharma has been charged and convicted in the past for this and now will start selling OCs to foreign markets. the sackler brothers are evil\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oxycontin-part3/

not saying this is definitely what happened but perhaps your mind played a trick on you. the five below and rue 21 storefronts can look similar (i understand the rue 21 writing is not always on the blue backdrop). perhaps you had seen a five below somewhere else and the rue 21 was moving to a bigger location in that shopping plaza and your mind read the new sign as five below? this could also explain why both stores were still there when you first saw it. again i am not trying to marginalize your experience or say my theory is correct i am just merely offering a possible explanation.\n\nfive below\nhttps://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dnd7dSl9ZQxpcpt6cxGV_Q/ls.jpg\n\nrue 21\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/24/db/41/24db41183679785d8fbb14576419c386.jpg
i'm not educated enough on airplanes and the atmosphere to speak objectively and i wanted to expose my bias. the original poster seems to have been looking for answers, but all i could do is verify that this exact thing has happened elsewhere and what they saw was not an isolated event. should i edit my original comment and take that part out ?
i tried it and even typed to the o in the first word it suggested for you and no suggestions like yours (no suggestions at all) were made. i have never gone to this website before. i believe you are not trying to intentionally deceive the readers here but i think perhaps that there is a different explanation. were u researching PG prior to this search on a different site and maybe the suggested searches are from that?
ya without the blue backdrop it would be hard to confuse the storefronts. good luck in search for answers this is definitely a very strange occurrence!
previous commenters are correct about the clause/claus thing. it was a pun for the movie title. the i love lucy thing i can remember hearing ricky ricardo saying that but also cannot point to a specific episode. i love lucy is my moms favorite show and i grew up watching it all the time. i do buy into the theory that it sounds like something ricky ricardo would say and believe that the misquote could become what everyone remembers best.
i am not the original poster of the pic and i am new to reddit i will try to keep these rules in mind going forward
i would suggest using the paper bag method from bomb the system https://youtu.be/R0eJ468pRHc
And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"\n\nAnd the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!\nYou see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."
it was a television show named Ed. the title sequence semi matches up to how you remember it and original theme song in the first season was next year by the foo fighters. the videos online cut out the theme music i assume because of copyright issues but i bet that is the show your remembering. next year was on the same album as learn to fly so it has a similar type of feel and could potentially be mistaken for each other by someone not familiar with early 00s alt rock/the foo fighters
these have been on the top of my r/all feed yesterday and today and are from different parts of the country i find it interesting that these old papers are being discovered. isn't wikileaks supposed to have some info disproving he moon landing? is this part of a psy op to reconfirm in the minds of americans that we actually landed on the moon?\n\nedit: i am noticing a lot of nasa imagery in the dallas cowboys game on fox right now as well. even so far as having the pregame commentary crew filmed wearing space suits
Saddam?\n\nI know you're talking about Obama, but dude you're trying way too hard.
Why is there a red marker on this post?\n\n**IF THE ADMINS OF THIS SUB ARE TRYING TO CLAIM THAT THIS POST IS BEING BRIGADED BECAUSE IT DOESNT FIT WITH THIER NARRATIVE, ISNT THAT THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS SUB WAS MEANT FOR**\n\nYA'LL ARE BEING JUST AS BAD AS THE DEMS AND PUBS YOU CLAIM TO HATE.
Lets hope!
Fun fact: You probably support Trump.
HAhahahahhaaa!
Lol, ZeroHedge.  Before Trump it was the world economy crashing......\n\nThen they bragged about the stock-markets skyrocketing under Trump.\n\nIm not saying ZH isn't good or untruthful.  I just think its sensationalized.  
Get the fuck out of here.  We're not your subservient "pedes".  We think for ourselves.\n\n
*Shock*\n\nYou meet a liberal who doesnt buy into the hazy culture that is Trumpland but am open to the idea that elites do some crazy backwards shit.\n\nHowever you'll never see me stand by a sexual predator or act like the mindless drones that are Trumpians.
So fucking true.  This place died when The_Donald sent its filth here.\n\nI honestly believe Trumps administration has the best paid online presence.  CTR may HAVE BEEN the best but thats falling apart quickly.
Better than Trump.  I'll take a bullet in my butt and Paul Ryan over Trump any fucking day.\n\nIve never hated something, or someone more than I hate Trump.  Never.
Wasn't Trump championing leaks when they benefited him?
I sure hope so. 
Good luck, but this sub is now another one of Trumps safe spaces.  I predict this gets buried, I hope it doesnt though because its obvious Trump is being controlled.
I dont agree.  The only reason you want this is so that Trump doesnt get talked about badly on this sub.  And he should be because he is just as bad as every other president we have had in this country.
If he ever cried it'd be for show.
Yeah, we are screwed.  Trump will make Academi his personal army.
He doesnt pay taxes dude.\n\nNext time Trump does anything with American Tax money u/m4k4v3l1Th3d0n better have a problem with it.  But I predict they wont.\n\nHow much are you being paid to post for the Trump org? :P
This man should be arrested.  Theses politicians are disgusting.
This is the most disgusting game of thrones bullshit.\n\nWhat happened to our country?
Idk man.  I'm lost.
I do too.  But Trump and other people eroded what is real/fake, who is real/fake.  Its a complete storm now and I hope they are proud of their idiocy. 
I think you mean they are removing bots.
Thanks for proving my point.  I even got you a little angry ;)\n\nGlad I could emotionally manipulate you into proving you're an anti semite.  This is actually one of the better back-and-forths I've had here!  Thanks man.\n\nAlso: 39 comment Karma and 1 post karma.  Too afraid to use your real account?  Somebody is utilizing their safe space!  Hey, but thats your choice. 
Psssst its because what he was doing was potentially TREASONOUS.\n\nYou know, our intelligence agencies were doing their jobs...\n\n
Slimy 
Your logic here makes no sense.  See u/Georex comment.
You're getting downvoted, but I agree 100% with you.
OP I Absolutely hate Trump and Hillary with a passion. No one should like Clinton. She's a frightening person. But what I get confused about here is all the Trump love.\n\nYou have got to be brainwashed or desperate to follow that guy. Insanity to me.
How much does the Trump campaign pay you?
This sub has been destroyed by R/The_Donald.
I get where you are coming form but no.\n\nTrump is an idiot, a self proclaimed serial sexual predator and he's unintelligent with authoritarian tendencies. \n\nTHATS why people fear him.
This place is either compromised or delusional.\n\nThey act like Trump is the second coming.  \n\nEDIT: REMEMBER GUYZ  OBAMA WILL BE PUTTING MARTIAL LAW THROUGH AAAAAAAANY MINUTE.  OR WAIT, IS IT THAT HE'LL BE INTERJECTED AS PRESIDENT AFTER TRUMP IS IMPEACHED?\n
Well since he's a sexual predator with possible ties to Russia, Im not doing anything.\n\nJesus, have you all gone mad?  Or is everyone here getting paid to support Trump?\n\nThink for yourselves.  My conclusion is that Trump is not a good guy, good for this country or anyone else for that matter.  \n\nHe's literally a fucking idiot.  He's unintelligent, and has never worked a day in his elitist life.\n\nWAAKE UPPPPPP!!!  Shit is getting weird.  
Not for me.  This place as of late hasbeen the opposite of an inclusive environment.  talk one bad thing about daddy Trump and you must be a disinfo shill.\n\nFuck the orange king.  He IS the conspiracy, and you're all willingly going with it!!!!
Not accurate in the slightest. Look up the definition of fight and realize that it can mean to "quarrel or argue". Language is complex and nuanced. Don't take things out of context for your own social gain.
Trump?
"Great Again"\n\n"*Great Again*"\n\nWhere have I heard that?  \n\n**YOU TRUMPIANS ARE RUINING THIS SUB**
Nice try but NyPost is state run propaganda.
Nice nihilism.  Go ahead and take a nap if you want.\n\nI choose to fight. 
We're all guilty of that, but you ARE right.  I should be careful, and I shouldnt generalize and attack but Jesus, Im just so frustrated by all of this bullshit.
Thank you!! Seriously I appreciate the kindness. If we don't  listen and actually hear each-other out. We are screwed as a country.
Go back to your sub please.  We dont want the hatred and lies you and Trump are selling.
Gonna apologize for spreading disinformation?
How can the media be "fake" when its deciding your fate?\n\n
They all look so awkward. Definitely forced\n
Your a Shill for The_Donald.  \n\n**GO AWAY PLEASE**
Its geographically more intertwined with Asia.  I would read "revenge of geography" by Kaplan.
Get your "Kek" bullshit out of this sub. No one wants to hear it. Go back to your safe space @ The_Donald. 
Dude Chafffetz is a fucktard.  
I think you meant to post this on The_Donald
The can *create* it, why have to rely on whats written if they can write it?
Good work, keep outing these agitators.  
What a fucking mess.  
Nice try Trump administration!
Welcome To Trumps world.  Its funny that you guys cant take what you and your daddy dish out.\n\nTrump started this hatred and disfunction, alternative facts and polarization.\n\nNow you are crying for it all to stop?  The *real world* doesnt work that way.\n\nHere is your [lord and master, boy is he a strong boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYr2XteXUB8)\n
Interesting because I talk badly about Trump here a lot and Im silenced and downvoted.
This looks *worse* than Jacksons take.  I mean in terms of visual effects.  This looks like a mess!
Dude you post at Trumps safe space all the time.  Of course you dont care.
This is exactly why America is dead.
Well, I guess they are getting their attention.
Good.  The American people have a spine.\n\nThis woman is scum.  She **bought** her way through democracy.  Her brother was the former head of Blackwater.
**HAIL CORPORATE**
This exactly.
By "mole" you mean patriot, right?
I dont think you're following...
100%.\n\nI love how everyone forgot that Trump was on Epsteins plane MULTIPLE times.
They are too busy dealing with a Treasonous uneducated "President".\n\nOh but wait, thats all just CTR and the libs.\n\nThe American people should be calling for the arrests of CLINTON and TRUMP.  Now thats draining the swamp.
Keep up the fight, these Trumpians will stop at nothing.  Must be getting paid alot of $$$
You're ruining this sub. Go back to The Donald.
We're literally running into the mad kind scenario.
I wish you were right.  I hope you are.  I believe we have 8 years of this monster.
They need to be called out.
Thats your "proof"?
Don't even try man. Everyone here seems to be a paid Trump supporter. This sub has gone down the drain, ever since the mods have been Trumpians. 
Have you tried talking about Trump here?  \n\nWhat world are you living in?
Who? What the fuck is happening to the world?
"Fox poll"\n\nSo overweight white racists on a hover round. Don't know if that's half of America but Trump did just win...
The funniest part of all of this?\n\nTRUMP DOESNT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THESE CODDLED CHILDREN.\n\nAnd yet, they fight for his "ideals" on his behalf.  He *loves* that.  And in the end he will throw you away.  Just like every other American president EVER.\n\nIdiots dividing us even further. 
Lol so now this sub cares about Morgan?\n\nJesus what made you all bend the knee to Trump?\n\n
Its **definitely** subjective.  Dont be demeaning just because most people on the thread will anonymously have your back.
Oh come the fuck on.
Stop posting on The_Donald?\n\nThen stop posting here, please.  \n\nThat should solve everything.
*Clicks username*\n\n*first post is a comment on R/The_Donald*\n\nJesus dude...
This man is pretending to care about the law enforcement of this country.  \n\nThis man is pretending to care about the veterans and current service members of this country.\n\nThis man is close to the former head of a disastrous private military firm, Acedemi.\n\nHe is ding this to get close to the powers of law and order in this country.  Its a soft and sow power grab that will end in a coup. 
One:  I agree with him.\n\nTwo:  This asshole forgets he welcomed the US government to trample over our privacy rights so he could remain rich.\n\nEat the rich.
She was our last hope and now she is letting herself be played with by the powers that be.
I hope him and Clinton rot in prison for what they have done.
Source?
YESSSSSS!  Put this man behind bars!
NEITHER.
I thought maybe I could have some nice dialogue here, but wow first post and Im being called retarted?!  Thats ok though, Ive been rude in the past too.  \n\nBut yes, this is the first time I have agreed with him.  I also agree on his stance with the Fed, although I think thats a hard thing to change.
I'm still new to geography as a geopolitical explainer, so I'm not sure of any others.  But this book is AMAZING and explains things wonderfully, its really turned my thinking on its head.
STILL blaming Obama?  Jesus.  You know when Trump starts going with his real plans, its going to be real hard to blame that shit on Obama.  \n\nI will be here to remind this sub of that.
Haha, that's funny, you think you have a choice. You're getting Zuckerberg now.
So he *didnt* prove he was alive then?\n\nAll of tis confuses me.
Dude, click on the PDF.\n\nEdit: formatting.
Probably just people that asked idiotic questions.
Like I said, the people being directly hurt the most are people that by and large supported and voted for him. Many are still Republican congressional districts so if you want to really make that blue wave in the House blue, well this is a way of doing it. This will be true where migrant labor is used in general. Farmers for the most part are not known to be Democrats even though Republicans rarely have their best interests at heart.
I can't believe you are brigading in here. What does this have to do with the IC committee? Anything?
Foreign money is illegal period.

I see besides TD, your favorite subs to post in are /r/ImGoingToHellForThis and /r/watchpeopledie. You need help. Big time. I hope you don't own a gun you sicko.\n\nAnd fire people and brag about it and piss your customers off and go out of business? Nothing wrong with that either.
You didn't say elected. You said Republicans. Rick Wilson, John Weaver, Evan McMullin, and Cheri Jacobus are not pundits. All except McMullin worked on losing candidates campaigns. Nichols is an author and a professor. Wittes is a leader at the Brookings Institute. The rest are now pretty much journalists only except for Will and Kristol.
Another trump turd that posts in /r/watchpeopledie. Yes, it is real narrow minded to think that perhaps there is something sick about that. Why don't you enlighten us as to why it isn't? We are waiting to hear.
The man is consistent.
Correct.
Sessions and next Wilbur Ross more of an issue when it comes to Russia.
Carroll County is still very southern in many ways. While becoming suburban, it still is a county with many farms and if you live there you most likely don't work there unless you are a farmer. As of 2007, Carroll County was the tenth wealthiest county in the country in its population range of 65,000 to 250,000.

Only in a fantasy world. That is why Sweden, a country not in NATO and known for its neutrality, now considers itself at war with Russia. Moldavia feels itself beaten down. Belarus feels it is about to be absorbed. Transnistria is in revolt. Four overflights of the Baltic States last week. Missiles in Kaliningrad. Russian troops on the offensive in the Donbas. Russian deployment of two missile sites that break current missile treaties with the US. Deployment of massive amounts of troops on the Baltic States borders. Annexation of Georgian territory. Purposeful targeting of civilians and hospitals in Aleppo. Almost no attacks against ISIS in Syria. Interfering in elections in multiple countries. Hacking of governments in the US, Norway, Poland, the Netherlands and Germany. But besides that, they do just want to get along.
I wouldn't. Saves me the trouble of showing up, having to ask the questions to find that out and saying no thanks. It becomes a time saving feature.

He runs out the best.
On private
Just did a search on the word "all" and it never actually says that.
The entire "elected" Republican party perhaps.
Should include Jeff Sessions. He is the one that introduced Carter Page into the Trump associates. Roger Stone isn't listed either.
Yes, and Bannon is a big fan.

He meant what he said.
Bloomberg journalist so shame on him if it is an example of this:\n\nhttps://news.vice.com/story/twitter-and-facebook-are-fueling-paranoia-about-ice-raids
His nickname among the Bannon crew is "Rancid Pubis".
> Trump’s chief policy adviser is staffing the administration with other key players who share his end-of-days, clash-of-civilizations perspective.\n> \n> Not long ago, Steve Bannon’s Capitol Hill townhouse had a plaque next to the front door proclaiming it “The Breitbart Embassy.” A similar sign may as well be placed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, renaming the White House “The Breitbart House,” one dedicated to bringing down the old power structure, including the Republican and Democratic establishments, and destroying the power of the international so-called Davos elites.\n> \n> The Breitbart House is apocalyptic. It aims to bring down the powers that be, and to replace them with a new world order. That’s a big task. Privately, reporters are saying that those Republicans they talk to on the Hill are worried about President Trump, but fear going after him because it might lose their constituents’ support.\n> \n> In audio recordings of his Sirius/XM radio program from 2015 and 2016, USA Today reported, Bannon “told his listeners that the United States and the Western world are engaged in a ‘global existential war,’ and he entertained claims that a ‘fifth column’ of Islamist sympathizers had infiltrated the U.S. government and news media.” Among other predictions, he said America and China would go to war in five to 10 years in the South China Sea. Both an “expansionist Islam” and an “expansionist China,” he argued, were “on the march… And they think the Judeo-Christian West is on the retreat.” Islam itself, he said is “darker” than either Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia ever was.\n> 
Everyone should watch this. Great interview. Americans should interview like this. This guy is an attack dog. Page is a lying weasel. 
Here is the official email from the Army that of course leaked online:\n\n[If you don’t think @realDonaldTrump’s #hiringfreeze hurts our military, and military families, think again. This just leaked online.](https://twitter.com/votevets/status/834179060137852931)
Shows he has an open mind and isn't a linear thinker like most are. That means he is willing to work across the aisle like in the old days. It's not the days of James Watt as Secretary of the Interior complaining about hearing hard rock when it was the Beach Boys playing on the Mall at the 4th of July and banning them the next year. So next year it was the Dead Kennedys playing with a banner across the stage that said "Fuck off James Watt". I was there. You probably weren't even born yet.
He would have gotten more votes if he told people he liked the DKs earlier. Someone into them cannot possibly be all that bad. No fascist tendencies for sure.
No one is going to watch a youtube video as a source moron. Video edited propaganda is only for knuckle draggers in TD. Like you.
I got it from @daveweigel twitter account. So evidently he is aware of  what is up here. Go to his.
Well that is because he is!
Though his lawyer then said he intended on meeting it, then silence.
Now self-commit yourself to your local mental hospital. Explain you belief in pizzagate. See you in about 10 years.
> Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to President Trump, said on Tuesday that Trump’s revised Muslim ban isn’t going to look that different from the current one. Rather, the new version will only have “minor technical differences,” potentially leaving it open to the same legal challenges that stymied the original ban.\n> \n> Miller went on to call the court’s order to temporarily halt the ban “flawed, erroneous, and false.”\n\nThat would be Stephen "Gestapo" Miller who was mentored by Nazi Richard Spencer at Duke and went on the Sunday morning talk shows 2 Sundays ago and proceeded to do nothing but lie as long as his tongue was wagging. This guy being in the White House shows the true face of the Bannon/Trump administration -- an abomination and stain on our country.
"Dutch thread, as soon as you post anything pro wilders, you get downvoted into oblivion."\n\n"Worst: it's too late to turn back. Islamic people will start playing a big role in politics (because they can back it up with voters. Right now we have like 40 parties to vote on, all with different motives.

> President Trump’s most colorful foreign policy critic, Eliot Cohen, reacting to appearances by chief of staff Reince Priebus on the Sunday shows, tweeted that Priebus reminds him “of the colorless, beliefless, spineless functionaries of 20th century totalitarians.” Well, Priebus, who happily turned over the GOP to Trump, has as much experience as anyone from his job as the Republican National Committee chairman in the “colorless, beliefless, spineless” functionary department.\n> \n> What is obvious both from his appearances and from recent events is how small and unimpressive Priebus is. He willingly parrots any Trump line no matter how loathsome, as he did in facing Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday“\n> \n> Lacking Trump’s confidence and bravado, Priebus comes across as bitter and whiny.\n> \n> Priebus is the chief of staff Trump wants, for now. Priebus’s weakness promotes chaos and impulsiveness, which Trump enjoys. Since discipline, order and chain of command are designed to minimize chaos and conflict, a less assertive and respected gatekeeper is essential for Trump.

Got to tell you. This means absolutely nothing to me but then I didn't know who Richard Marx was until I saw his tweet and looked. When he had his first number 1 song, I was listening to much different music.

> Russian President Vladimir Putin’s favorability among Americans is at its highest point since 2003, with Republicans behind his gains, according to a new Gallup poll released Tuesday.\n> \n> Putin’s favorability is up 20 percentage points among Republicans, with 32 percent holding a favorable view of him today, compared to 12 percent in 2015.\n> \n> Ten percent of Democrats have a favorable view of Putin today, compared to 15 percent in 2015. The Russian leader’s favorability among independents is up 11 percentage points, with 23 percent having a favorable view of him today compared to 12 percent two years ago.\n\nTrump is building a party willing to love a autocratic, murdering thug. A cult of personality. Like him. Only **I** can do this. Give me the reigns of power. Democracies are inefficient in solving our problems, are they not? We need a Triumph of the Will.
He lied.
Damn, no one even sends out an email. Pretty messed up.
> Vice President Mike Pence came, communicated and exited without taking questions. He said the United States would be “unwavering” in its commitment to NATO, whose glories he extolled. (He never mentioned the European Union, whose fragmentation Trump encourages.)\n> \n> If a question had been allowed, it might have been: “Mr. Pence, you defend NATO but your boss says it’s obsolete. So which is it?”\n> \n> To which the answer could well have been: “This is an administration that says everything and the contrary of everything. I advise you to get used to it — and pay up.”\n> \n> But getting used to an American president who responds through Twitter to the last guy in the room or what he’s just seen on TV, has no notion of or interest in European history, and has turned America’s word into junk, is not easy. Europeans are reeling.
Side that loves Castro? Tell me, whose company illegally went around the law and had business dealing with Cuba? That would be Trump's. Now, do you have any evidence that the Democrats love Cuba? Who was the president when the the Bay of Pigs occurred? The first real embargo on Cuba? Hint, JFK. As far as Chavez, show me any evidence for this bs statement 4 hour old account created on the banks of the Volga?\n\n
What a socialist sell out. In the aftermath of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Kucinich called for the Federal Reserve System to be put under control of U.S. Treasury. Not a progressive. Sounds like Rand Paul. Kucinich further said that the voting age should be lowered to 16. My experience here on Reddit tells me that 18 may be too low.\n\n> On August 31, Al Jazeera reported that a document had been found in the headquarters of the Libyan intelligence agency which according to the author appears to be a summary of a conversation between Kucinich and an intermediary for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in which the congressman asked for information about the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council (NTC), possible links of it to al-Qaeda and corruption evidences, to lobby US lawmakers to put an end to NATO airstrikes and suspend their support for the NTC. It also listed information necessary to defend Saif al-Islam against International Criminal Court war crimes charges. Kucinich defended himself in a message to The Atlantic Wire, saying that the document in question is simply a summary of Kucinich's public positions on the Libyan campaign by a Libyan bureaucrat who never consulted with Kucinich himself. "Al Jazeera found a document written by a Libyan bureaucrat to other Libyan bureaucrats. All it proves is that the Libyans were reading the Washington Post... Any implication I was doing anything other than trying to bring an end to an unauthorised war is fiction."\n\nSo this isn't the first time he has done rogue foreign policy with murdering dictators.\n\n> The American people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with Russia in Syria. The demonization of Russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison d’être for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination.\n> \n> — Dennis Kucinich, The Nation (October 26, 2016)\n\nSounds like Tulsi Garbage and RT propaganda.
Make it easy for us. All I see from you is one insane comment after another that no one in their right mind wants to go through:\n\n"So, flimsy accusations of what exactly?

You sick SOB. Delete your account.
There are plenty of Republicans speaking out against Trump. 
Protestant.
Bet when he was in Iraq, he was Rocking the Casbah. Nothing but punk on the mp3 player.
Really? You mean like overblown garbage on emails and the Clinton Foundation while virtually ignoring Trump's Russia connections? Not until he got elected did the media realize they had enabled the election of a corrupt monster enabled through espionage by Russia. Some day Trump may actually have say something negative to say about Putin but I'm not holding my breath. Why is it so hard to say something negative about an autocratic, murdering, thug who is causing trouble with our allies and interfered in our elections? Well, investigations should let us soon know. And many conservative, very conservative journalists, pundits and GOP strategists think that Trump is owned by the Russians and is dead meat. In fact, it is these same people that first raised the Russia alarm, not liberal journalists. But now, they are all after him and it is not going to die. That SOB is going to get nailed. He has been financed from go by Putin's bagman and the Donald isn't going to be able to run or hide.

I didn't even try that one. Too boring. For president was too long, so 2020 sounded the best. I am just reserving for whomever wants it to stop bernouts from messing with it.
> Timmy Morrison was delivered by emergency C-section, weighing in at 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Doctors put him under anesthesia within a week and into surgery within a month. Some of the contents of his stomach sometimes made their way to his lungs. Workers in the intensive care unit frequently needed to resuscitate him.\n> \n> He arrived seven weeks premature — but, in a way, just at the right time.\n> \n> Six months before Timmy was born, President Barack Obama signed a sweeping health care law that would come to bear his name. Six days before Timmy’s birth, the Obama administration began to phase in a provision that banned insurance companies from limiting how much they would pay for any individual’s medical bills over his or her lifetime. At the time the Affordable Care Act passed, 91 million Americans had employer-sponsored plans that imposed those so-called lifetime limits.\n> \n> That group included Timmy’s parents, whose plan previously included a $1 million lifetime limit. This Obamacare provision took effect September 23, 2010. Timmy was born September 29. On December 17, he surpassed $1 million worth of bills in the neonatal intensive care unit. He didn’t leave the NICU until he was 6 months old.\n> \n> If Timmy had been born a week earlier, his medical benefits could have run out while he was still in the NICU. But that didn’t happen. His insurer covered everything. The NICU bills his parents save total just over $2 million (they come out to $2,070,146.94, to be exact).\n> \n> For decades, lifetime limits were a mainstay of the American health insurance system. In 2009, **55 percent of Americans with employer-sponsored coverage were enrolled in health plans that capped medical benefits.**\n> \n
It can though.

In fact, when you think about it perhaps life itself is rigged too.
You post in two of the worse conspiracy laden, echo chamber, Hillary hating, filthy name calling subs on Reddit /r/Kossacks_for_Sanders and /r/WayOfTheBern. Where Hillary Clinton is personally responsible for murdering her opponents and she has been called every vile term you can think of. I invite everyone to go check out these to vile subs and see what they are all about.
http://www.fakenewschecker.com/fake-news-source/duran\n\nAlex Christoforou who now runs the duran lives in Moscow.\n\nThis guy mainly posts clickbait shit for upvotes from shit sites like this. 
Just in case he does run, I have created https://np.reddit.com/r/Hickenlooper2020/ for people to own and stop the bernouts from messing with. I don't know that much about the guy, but he isn't Bernie, he is from a flyover blue state, he is liberal, he is governor that has been elected twice and therefore had to work for a living so he has to be better than bernie. We should start snagging everyone that seems like a real possibility moving forward.
Where all the bad journalists that wrote against the great Putin gained a bit of lead in the brain.
I'm sorry, but why the f do we care now? For a supposed bernie fan, how come you never post anything about Bernie?
10 posts in last 10 months, none in here. Troll much with this account? Fuck off with this bullshit. This has been documented elsewhere. This bill was never negotiated with Canada. Do you really believe that the Canadian government, that negotiates prices with the pharmaceutical companies based on volumes of sells and assuming the US is going to continue to subsidize the costs of these drugs, is going to let a huge export of these drugs leave Canada at the negotiated price knowing full well that the companies will not allow them to keep the lower prices if they are now in the large export business for these drugs? No way. The Canadians will end up shutting down all exports to the US which will hurt the most vulnerable users of this, individual retired people. This was a jackass way of doing it and that is why so many Republicans went for it because they knew that is what would happen. 
No circumstantial evidence, delusions. Everyone in NYC orders slices of cheese. No code. No tunnels. Going there at the end of the month. You are a sick, delusional idiot. I am going to ask people there about sickos like you and post on Reddit. In fact, I am going to hear Tom Nichols talk about his book, get a copy signed and meet in person for the first time. You live in a fantasy world. You sit on your computer a spin fantasies and talk about evidence of things without ever having seen anything, talked to anyone or been anywhere. And all of law enforcement is in on it. Before the inauguration, "Trump was going to put an end to it".  Is he in on it now? As messed up as he is, he would tell you to get help. You are being played. No you have never been there. No you have never seen the band that you all make a big deal about or the artist whose art is there and has been exhibited in the Brooklyn Art Museum.  No L'Enfant does not mean young boy, it is the name of the guy that first laid out the streets of DC and the guy that owns Ping Pong Comet Pizza has a Greek name but you all are too stupid to realize that. Go get a life.
Just be careful. After this org came out, the RT show "Redacted Tonight" put on a show "Brand New Congress" to distract from Trump's Russia troubles. The bernouts were all posting it. Pure propaganda to take advantage of this org but should be ignored for what it is. 
Why don't you troll somewhere that people care about morons like you? You have nothing intelligent to say clearly. Go pout somewhere else. No one wants to hear it here from the children's brigade. This is adults only.
Ryan as Minority leader might do us a favor and retire.
Last summer, crops rotted in Alabama. This year, the Central Valley in California, where most of the farmers voted for Trump, are now saying "we didn't think he really meant it". Except California feeds the country and has a huge export market. And you are right, no one else will do this work.\n\nOn top of that, most of the undocumented pay taxes, Social Security and Medicare for us because they will never see the latter two back. They obviously pay sales taxes too. They commit less crimes and they can't draw on government benefits. No immigration, then we better start procreating. Their children know nothing about their home country or were even born here. This is not immigration reform. The Republicans that were for it refused to address it and we are now about to see something the majority of Americans, and a good part of Trump voters, are against. We are going to be shamed in the eyes of the world. And as a country, we never did the cheap and obvious thing to stop it happening. In fact, the profitable thing even though the law is on the books -- fine companies massively that hired undocumented workers. We started to many years ago but then business lobbies kicked in and that ended rather quickly.
Rick Wilson, David Frum, Max Boot (though he has now left the party), John Weaver, Evan McMullin, Bill Kristol, Benjamin Wittes, Tom Nichols, Louise Mensch, Cheri Jacobus, George Will, Jennifer Rubin just to name a few.
I am surprised you came out of your echo chamber. For someone so sure of yourself, you are going to be awfully disappointed when nothing actually happens to her legally aren't you? Requires Sessions to do something and he has his own Russia issues to worry about since he is implicated. But while you are here, in Trump's first month in office, can you name one thing he has accomplished that will directly make your life, and therefore my life, (I am assuming you are middle class like me) directly better? You have got to deliver if you want to stay in the game here.\n\nEdit: 1 hour later. Guess turboturd can't come up with one thing. Sad. In fact that has been par for the course so far. It is the Democrats fault though.
Evidence? We don't need no stinkin evidence.
Pretty sure he first appeared on this very sub.
Correct. Impeachment is a political process. Andrew Johnson committed no crime.
Post links to the ones in last week or STFU. I see zero. You mention his name in one two months ago and it is not an article touting his accomplishments, just a whine fest. That is it. I am still trying to get through the 100 plus you posted saying Obama was going to pardon Hillary Clinton before he left office. Next the 200 plus on how the Democrats were going to steal the election from Trump. You are a trumptard.\n\nHillary Clinton is done politically. No one is going to prosecute her, investigate her or anything. You just post click bait from sites, some of which even have trojans on them that the mods, when warned, leave up. You are a menace. 
Courting them for what?
Sure you do. You chat with your fellow sickos in /r/watchpeopledie.
##KEK WILLS IT
Yes, but you are a sick mother fucker posting pizzagate crap that needs to be locked up like John Hinckley was for many years. The fact that you have not been committed and aren't on heavy medications is pretty scary. If I could dox you and turn you into the police, I would gladly sacrifice my account to get a sick shit like you off the streets.
Well for a pro-Bernie guy, he sure is loving Trump on every post.
And real rationing. They claimed we would get rationed health care. It still is but much less. If you don't have insurance or insurance with limits, it is very rationed. You don't get that liver transplant. You don't get that cancer treatment. You don't get that bone marrow graft. You die. It's rationed unless you have top insurance or are rich.
Waiting for your pro-Bernie posts links, been 5 hours. Not going to happen because they don't exist. Not like what you post is hidden. You can claim, pervicate, and lie even, but you are not going to show what doesn't exist. You are not the first troll to do this and probably not the last. The last one caught doing this ended up leaving after the election and being a self-confessed, paid Russian troll. Does that include you too? Don't worry, Reddit doesn't give a crap.\n\nEdit: Well you manage to downvote. Here is some hardcore pro-trump posts by you though:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5vfngp/liberal_lies_about_president_trump_as_it_turns/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v4daq/intel_officials_cleared_trump_campaign_of_contact/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v3cj1/democrats_standing_behind_president_rogue_deep/\n\n\nNow tell me, which one of these does Bernie Sanders buy into? Answer, none.
Damned if she does, damned if she doesn't. She has no formal or official role in politics or the party anymore. She is only a private citizen. She needs to keep her statements to a minimum at this point. Just like previous nominees that did not win. Even Al Gore did after losing a race that in reality he won the electoral vote even. For her to say this much is unusual. Only because Trump is such an abomination. For Obama to say as much as he has said is even more unusual.
Why yes, that's correct because he is an unholy disaster. While given your karma total and comments, and having been on here two years, it's quite obvious your presence would not be missed at all if you were to stop posting, in fact it would probably be quite welcomed by a majority.
\n\n> going so far as to making the ballot papers not even mention the Tories at all, instead using 'Ruth Davidson for a strong opposition' \n\nI don't think this is true. The ballots still used Scottish Conservatives as the party name, "Ruth Davidson for a strong opposition" was just the slogan you're allowed to add. I'm pretty sure it would be illegal to use a false party name on the ballot.\n\nHere's an article saying the party name was also on the ballot.\n\n> The MSP will use the new slogan with her party’s name on regional list voting papers.\n\nhttp://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-conservative-leader-ruth-davidson-7505142
As a unionist, I'm finding a lot of comfort in these figures. It's pretty apparent now that support for independence has hit its ceiling. It didn't rise when the Tories won a majority in 2015, it didn't rise when the vow went unfulfilled, it didn't rise after the EU referendum result and now it hasn't risen after May confirmed hard Brexit. If the past few years haven't done anything to help independence, then nothing will. There's no threat of independence for a generation now.
They're not even close to relative sizes.
Thanks for that, it's amazing how these self described "citizen investigators" can't even do a basic Google search themselves.
Just as bad as the people complaining about multimillionaires voting in Trump.
No, but the submitter has spammed the same story about 15 times in the last hour anyway. Seems to have a really unhealthy obsession with Clinton.
Knife manufacturers don't give you bonus points for stabbing people though. It would be argued that pokestops and spawns on private property are encouraging players to trespass or enter dangerous areas, and that that Niantic should have forseen and prevented this.\n\nYou don't have to literally force someone to do something to be legally responsible for their actions. If you incite a riot, you're not forcing anyone to riot but you'll still be responsible. If you tell your employees they don't need to wear safety equipment and one of them gets in an accident, you didn't force them not to be safe but you can still be held responsible. And if you create an app that incentivises going to certain areas, and you don't take any effort to make sure those area are public and safe, you can be held responsible for that.
Trying to win back Scotland is a waste of resources at the moment. Taking seats from the Conservatives is far more important than winning seats back from the SNP as the SNP can be relied on to support a minority Labour government anyway in the event of another hung parliament.
Could you link to a specific source? I've tried googling "Oxford University Research Centre UKIP vote" and the only result is your comment.
Why not? Countries like France and Germany ignore EU rules all the time. Do you really think the EU will want to get involved in the NI conflict? They'll turn a blind eye just like they do to all sorts of other things.

Every comment when you or the mods are challenged, you try and distract by bringing up David Brock. Highly suspicious. Is this current agenda you've been given by your handlers? Covering up your own shilling by making people chase after the big CTR bogeyman?
Again, not doubting the public supports nationalisation of major services. We're talking specifically about things like phone companies, haulage firms, betting shops etc.
They're not right, they're just rabble rousing for the upcoming Northern Irish Assembly election. Both the UK and Irish governments have committed to keeping free movement. Neither side want it and it's not going to happen 
The candidate in this by-election, Sarah Olney, wasn't an MP at the time. The current Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, kept to his pledge and voted against the fee rises. I don't see how it's relevant in this case.
There are a lot of hot dog stands  in Hawaii. Why do you need to know which one specifically?
> Why would they assume building 7 was going to fall and not any other buildings?\n\nBecause it was visibly bulging and creaking.\n\n> At approximately 2:00 pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7 World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse.[44] During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building.[45] Around 3:30 pm, FDNY Chief Daniel A. Nigro decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7 World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center#Collapse\n\nThe other buildings weren't showing any signs of imminent collapse.
But you only shown support for nationalising energy and rail, not all utilities, and certainly not down to betting shops. You're making a bit of a leap somewhere.
The mods here are deleting any negative Trump stories that get too many upvotes and stickying pro-Trump posts instead. And the majority of the users seem happy about it. I miss when this subreddit was a about independent and free thought and not just a /r/the_donald sister subreddit. A year ago the users would have been calling for the mods heads for this sort of behaviour. Unbelievable .
This dominoes quote is the perfect example of pizzagaters purposely take things out of context to make them appear strange. Read the full email:\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/50332\n\nIt's a friend of Podesta's called Herb thanking him for sending a box of cheeses as a Christmas present. In previous years, Herb's usually received pasta as a gift, so he makes a joke about whether the cheese will make him any better at playing dominoes.\n\nDominoes appears to be one of Herbs known hobbies as he's mentioned it in emails to Podesta before. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860\n\nIt's a joke between two old friends and makes perfect sense in context.
Why would the Democrats ever agree to that?
> Was it also the Commission that suggested the move from household to individual registration?\n\nIt was the Electoral Commission, they've been calling for a change to individual voter registration for while. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7303606.stm
There seems to be more Scottish users complaining about the English users in this thread than the other way around at the moment.
It is in the article.\n\n> More than 100 people in the film industry, including Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronofsky, and David Lynch signed a petition in 2009 calling for Polanski's release.[78][86][87] Multiple actors, including Meryl Streep, gave a standing ovation at the 2004 Academy Awards.[88]\n\nI agree with you that there's no conspiracy here though. Just another /r/the_donald user trying to defend Milo's pedastry advocacy.
Looks like pro-Trump trolls trying to bury the Trump-Russia story. Stay vigilant and keep open minded. Don't let them dictate what we can and can't discuss on this subreddit.
The Democratic party held a vote amongst it's members to select it's nominee, and Sanders lost. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016\n\nHe could have run as an independent, but he realised that it would split the left of centre vote and help Trump, so he decided to campaign for Clinton instead, who is much closer to him ideologically.
This is a fashion article, not a conspiracy. Take your nonsense spam elsewhere.
Government told people everything was safe and under control and now they are saying the structure may fail within an hour!
This is why I don't believe pizzagate. Not a coincidence that the allegations first appeared in the run up to the election, or that they were targeted entirely at Hillary and her campaign team. Obvious political smear job.
Even if you think the respondents were considering that, which is debatable, your source showed that there isn't a majority of public support for nationalising utilities.
People like talking about how old their grandkids are. Go talk to any old lady and they'll inevitably start listing their grandkids names and ages. I don't know why but it's not unusual.\n\nAgain, I think the bigger issue is with you reading someone describing their grandkids and immediately jumping to sexual thoughts.
Following through was an explicit manifesto promise.\n\n> We will hold that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcome.\n\nhttps://www.conservatives.com/manifesto\n\nPg 72
That's demonstrably false though. There's lots of landmark left wing policy that Blair passed  that the Conservatives wouldn't (minimum wage, tax credits, paternity leave, establishment of regional parliaments), and lot of stuff the Tories would have passed that Blair didn't (everything the Tories are doing now, slashing benefits, privatising royal mail, anti union legislation). I feel like some on the left are letting Iraq completely cloud their view of Blair and purposely ignoring all his achievements, leading to this false "no different to the Tories" narrative.
> and created this impression that they love it just the way it is... \n\nNo he hasn't, he's always said the EU needs reform. http://www.libdemvoice.org/liblink-tim-farron-the-eu-is-bloated-and-bureaucratic-but-it-just-needs-reform-50979.html\n\nHere's the Lib Dems top 10 priorities for reform from around the time of the 2014 European elections.\n\n> Liberal Democrats are unambiguously the party of IN. But we know that the EU is not perfect, which is why we are committed to remaining part of the EU and reforming it.\n\n> Our top 10 priorities for reform are: \n\n> 1. Creating jobs – Britain pioneered the single market. We should now lead in opening up Europe’s online industries, energy market and services like accountancy, law and architecture where the UK has a competitive edge, creating opportunities for UK firms to expand trade and create jobs.\n\n> 2. Reforming trade with the world – we will seek to accelerate trade negotiations with the USA, which could be worth up to £10 billion extra to the UK economy each year, and the EU-Japan trade agreement, which could increase UK GDP by £5 billion a year, creating thousands of jobs.\n\n> 3. Reforming the EU budget – following the UK’s success in cutting £30bn from the EU budget, Liberal Democrats will continue to campaign to reform the budget by reallocating wasteful spending towards job-creating policies such as cross-border energy and transport infrastructure, the digital economy, and research and development.\n\n> 4. Cutting waste – Liberal Democrats will continue to campaign to bring an end to the waste and travel between the European Parliament cities of Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg. This will save £150m and almost 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.\n\n> 5. Cutting red tape – we will support the ‘Think Small First’ principle to reduce unnecessary European Union regulatory costs, which particularly hit smaller businesses. We will demand effective impact assessments before new proposals come forward and exempt smaller businesses from legislation where appropriate.\n\n> 6. Devolving powers – Liberal Democrats support the principle that decision-making should be “European where necessary, national where possible”. National parliaments should play a greater role in scrutinising EU rules, and where proposals are unacceptable, parliaments should work together to send proposals back to the drawing board.\n\n> 7. Defending the UK’s interests – the Eurozone countries are an increasingly powerful bloc. The next time there is Treaty Change, we will insist on new legal safeguards guaranteeing that whenever a change impacts on the Single Market, Euro-ins and Euro-outs have an equal say.\n\n> 8. Fighting 21st century crime - Liberal Democrats would build up the EU’s capacity to tackle cybercrime, and do more with our neighbours to tackle cross-border crimes like VAT fraud, money laundering and the hoarding of criminal assets. And we will push for reforms to the European Arrest Warrant to ensure that civil liberties are protected.\n\n> 9. Strengthening our defences – more efficient defence co-operation is vital if European powers are to retain significant military capabilities in the face of continuing austerity and uncertain regional security. The European Defence Agency, working together with NATO, should continue to help member states to pool and share military capabilities. There can be no ‘European army’, and UK Parliament must always have the final say on the use of force.\n\n> 10. Tackling climate change – Liberal Democrats want to introduce ambitious reforms to combat climate change by agreeing an EU-wide 40% reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (50% if there is a global deal) and revamping the Emissions Trading Scheme to introduce a working carbon market, giving investors the certainty they need.
The Conservatives had a manifesto promise to honour the results of the referendum, and were then elected to a majority. If article 50 gets blocked it wouldn't be representative democracy either.
So if a different think tank had chosen a living wage of £5 an hour just before the Living Wage Foundation had picked theirs, that would be the correct living wage now because they got there first?

Yeah, this LPT always appears before Christmas, and I've never understood it. Why would you need to bring your own knife when your host will almost certainly have various kitchen knives, scissors, etc in the house already? Are people having Christmas in the woods or something?

It's Russian shills upvoting pizzagate and other stories to distract from Trump scandals. They've been doing it for months now. Notice how the second top post on the front page, posted shortly after the "Breaking report" one, is a generic anti-CTR post with nearly 500 upvotes? This is their top strategy for hiding themselves. Keep the sub focused only on CTR and it gives the Russian shills free reign to manipulate this place as they wish.\n\nScreenshot this comment, the mods will delete it soon for being too close to the truth.
The way you're using it is a distraction. You're trying to delegitimise all criticism of the mods by implying it's all coming from Brock, with no proof. It's obvious what you're doing to everyone who sees your posts.
15th anniversary of 9/11 was last month. Hurricane Mathew was a few weeks ago.

The new leader, Tim Farron, kept his promise and voted against the fee rises. Does he make it more likely for you to give them a second chance?
That's because if it's a good job, you don't realise it's a job at all. Most boob jobs are not the botched attempts that get posted here. You've almost certainly said "those are great boobs" to a pair without realising they're implants.
It's basically the first game with a handful of extra unit types and 3D graphics instead of sprites.

Hundreds of unsubstantiated comments everyday in /r/conspiracy claiming CTR, American Bridge, David Brock etc are shilling in this subreddit, and the mods don't react. I make one comment mentioning the possibility of Russian shills and suddenly you're rushing in here to label it "utter shit" and threatening to ban me? You couldn't have proved my point better if you tried.\n\nWhy the double standard? Why was the Trump-Russia story from a couple of weeks ago immediately tagged as "unverified" and then deleted, but the Clinton fleeing the country story on the top of the front page now hasn't even been tagged? It's equally unverified, the sole source seems to be a supermarket tabloid.\n\nAre all the mods controlled by the Kremlin, or are you all just heavily biased for Trump on your own?
So did the SNP. http://www.snp.org/i_m_with_her\n\nI'm pretty sure every left wing party supported Clinton when the alternative was Trump.

Do you have a source for your claim that a majority also support public ownership of phone lines, engineering firms, haulage companies, and betting shops?
Lamb's no more charismatic than Farron, and he has the baggage of voting for the fee rises that Farron doesn't. I don't see how he'd be doing any better.
Here's the same interview on CNN.\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/08/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-intv/index.html\n\nDo you not even bother to do basic Google search before making such claims?
They're not really legal anywhere. The original Occupy Wall Street gatherings in New York ended with mass arrests too.
Problem is they probably will get a majority again. Voters will eventually tire of the Conservatives, and they'll end up turning to Labour as the second biggest party just to get them out. The 1983 election had a similar result to this poll (Con 42%, Lab 27%), and 14 years later Labour were back in power with a landslide victory.
The /r/conspiracy mods are completely compromised. This is clear proof of their pro-Trump/pro-Russia bias. They've had no issue leaving the flimsiest of theories up at the top of /r/conspiracy over the years, but as soon as an anti-Trump story breaks they desperately intervene to censor and bury the discussion. This is disgraceful and if the users of /r/conspiracy have any dignity they'll demand the mods responsible step down.
You're really twisting that. She's just warning her guests that there'll be young children running around. It's a common courtesy.\n\nWhat's wrong with your mind that you see "kids" and "entertainment" and immediately jump to something sexual?
Funny like the two users /u/-Veridian and /u/JimiKendricks_ who describe this only as a cop's bad work and who question PizzaGate have both accounts exactly 10 days old.
I think what he's asking is, how do you know Russia and Trump don't have their own CTR like organisations that are trying to bury the BuzzFeed story and push pizzagate? The reaction to the Trump/Russia story on this subreddit yesterday was an almost textbook example of how these groups work. The front page was immediately flooded with posts claiming hoaxes and brigades in an obvious attempt to forum slide the BuzzFeed article. When it failed, mods censored the discussion by deleting the post, and are now sticking pizzagate post in a very transparent attempt to direct this subreddit back to an anti-Democrat pro-Trump narrative.\n\nI think there are groups infiltrating and influencing this sub, but it's not Brock or CTR. The majority of the shills here are all being paid in Roubles.

Misleading headline. The Clinton Foundation is not shutting down, the Clinton Global Initiative is. The CGI is just one program in the Clinton Foundation. Also, this was initially announced back in October, so it has nothing to do with her losing the election. It was closing regardless. http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/clinton_global_initiative_to_lay_off_74_at_new_york_office.html
They frequently accuse the mods of default subreddits and the reddit admins of being part of the shills. Yet another double standard. Why are only the /r/conspiracy mods unquestionable?\n\n> some mods like Trump and that's their right\n\nof course it's their right, but it's not right that they act on that bias in their moderating actions. Is it so unreasonable to want fair and consistent moderation? I see you dodged my question about why stories negative to Trump are immediately tagged as "unverified", "hoax", etc, and often deleted, while anything anti-Clinton is allowed to run free no matter how much nonsense it is. Certain mods are clearly trying to shape this subreddit into a pro-Trump safe space.

Obvious fabrications make it to the front page all the time. Search this subreddit for submissions that have been give the MISLEADING tag. They never caused such an immediate and violent reaction here before. There must be some kernel of truth to the story because it clearly caused some group to go into overtime trying to get it off the front page.
I'm guessing you and most of your friends went to university? Most people I know who went to uni rented shared houses as you describe. However, I know a few people who went straight into work after finishing school, and among them it was quite common to stay with their parents for a few years to save up and then buy a house on their own.
It's possible, the majority of the students I spoke to in 2010 seemed to have no knowledge of Labour breaking their tuition fees pledge in 2003.

There plenty of people out there capable of blowing themselves up, but not capable enough to properly cover themselves online.
You've been in everyone of these threads recently defending the mods. You've been using the exact same points over and over to try and discredit any criticism of the mods, almost like you're working off a script. Who are you working for? Are you one of the mod's sock puppet accounts or are you on someone's payroll?
This site's methodology might be out of date. I can't find it now, but I'm sure I read an article recently about how the demographics of Labour's support has shifted enough since Corbyn took over that the electoral map has now switched to benefit the Conservatives. I think the Conservatives would likely end up with more seats than that.
Other than one being over wi-fi, what's the difference?
In the UK, most people will have a kitchen knife or a pair of scissors in their home already, so this LPT is unnecessary here anyway.

Poor logic. Pete Townshend never disputed that he paid for child porn. The rest follows. Must all be true?
He is maybe an idiot, but the MSM are literally trying to manipulate facts to help overthrow a democratically elected president to put into power some un-elected people representing the military-industrial complex! I truly believe that ending democracy is much more dangerous than 4 years of Trump's idiocy. This Democracy Now [interview](https://www.democracynow.org/2017/2/16/greenwald_empowering_the_deep_state_to) of Glenn Greenwald sums it up pretty well.
>it comes from shameless conspiracy subs  \n\nI am not characterizing you on what type of subs you post in, but on what you say only...
This is not because the U.S. military sucks. This is not some form of incompetence. This is engineered to happen that way by the Deep State and its servants. The military-industrial complex needs wars to exist. That's why it wants us to continue fighting wars without winning them. Its their goal.
Nope. I never do that! The /r/The_Donald admins were just not very receptive to that type of humor...

The Globalists want to get rid of Trump, but they don't want to bare the consequences if they fail, so they're feeding repeatedly the public with that narrative, hoping that some crazy people will take down Trump for them. Always the same story, privatizing profits and socializing losses...

For your information, there exists several "lefts" which are sadly regrouped under the same label. For example, the "corporate" left is more a plutocrat faction of disguised republicans without the antics of the latter when the "democratic socialist" left is more a type of social democracy party close to what is done in Norway or Denmark. Even though they are both labeled "the left", they have little in common. So, I have no problem to post some articles on "the left"...
Nice find! LOL!
I agree 120%!
A real funny one!
In fact there was one first: supporting Bernie. Then, it was to get Clinton to lose. Now it's pushing Berniecrats again and also to call out the insane war that the corporate-backed MSM is waging against Trump, not because what he does (which would be legitimate and which I expect to be done by Bernie), but because he isn't controlled by them...
LOL!

Eventually, Clinton will go to prison and this country will be a country of law again.
The article refers more to the liberal MSM propaganda, not so much to the politicians.
It would really, really be fun if they try to contact me!  
I really don't know who banned me, but it's sad. 
I am not for Trump, but the fact that he prevents coming in citizens from countries we are currently bombing daily (except Iran) is not too irrational. It's true: the US are currently bombing daily Libya, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Syria. So to accept their citizens at the same time is rather...awkward.

Hey. It's not because Bernie says this or Bernie says that anyone should always take a microphone and sing what he just said. I like Bernie's ideas because they are the one that make the most sense for the future of the U.S. and the rest of the world. I like his strong environmental stances  because environment and knowledge are the only things we really transfer to the next generation. I also like Bernie's ethics because because he put humans first before greed and money. Nevertheless, Bernie's no god. And I'm no parrot. I will always keep my critical thinking in any case. And if you would have simply looked at my gilded posts made during the primaries, you wouldn't say some stupid things like "Bernie4Ever has no interest in Bernie, only in right-wing causes." I don't like Trump, but for the moment, the ridiculous actions of the corporate leftists are laughable. I am glad that Trump is driving them crazy and challenging their arrogance in unpredictable ways. And if you believe that this country can't survive these next 4 Trump right-wing years, you should read some history books. 
If I am a Trump supporter, you are a Russian agent.

The police officer as quoted in the article:  \n>“He also possessed over 1,000 pairs of soiled little girls’ underwear in his trailer, and these pairs were displayed almost throughout his mobile trailer home,” Weintraub said at a press conference. **“This was a perverse shrine to his criminal conquests.” [...] “This man was a trophy collector and creator of monumental proportion. He was a historian. He historically recorded all of his conquests”** [...] The so-called trophies indicate there could be many more, dating back 40 years[...] According to a probable cause affidavit, Thomas told police **his attraction to children began at a young age** and that he was aware some children were either asleep during these assaults or too young to be able to disclose abuse. **“I fear we may never know the scope of this man’s predation.”**  \n
LOL!
Because we are living in the tyranny of absolute corporate power. It will only change when the people at the head of these organizations and their owners are held accountable for these type of actions. Not just with some type of laughable fine, but with pure and simple confiscation of their entire assets and very long prison time.

You're correct. Correlation and causality aren't equivalent. But there's so much pedophile correlation around James Alefantis that its causality's probability becomes pretty significant.

Who said it was wasted? It was simply reallocated to the wealthiest arms producers, arm dealers and mercenary providers in the world. It's called warfare subsidies. What was wasted was the lives, the time and the energy spent on all this madness by all the others. But don't worry, the Rulers won't have to deal with that, they're already moving to the next war...
Nice to hear from you. Now that Clinton has been definitely pushed aside from the highest office, my pivot against Trump is about to start. I'll still be satisfied to see her go to prison, though.
>The vast majority of OPs karma comes from /r/politics/ which can be very hive-minded.  \n\nI hope I am not the one you are referring to. I got only 9,573 karma from /r/politics out of my total of 618,800 which equals **to less than 1.55% of all my karma**. So it's simply false to say that "the vast majority" of my karma comes from /r/politics.\n\n

Even I agree with you, but it would be so good if true, so I couldn't resist posting it.
> nothing but lies about Clinton \n\nI believe you and me must live in different alternate realities and we communicate through reddit.  \n&nbsp;  \n>One of the admitted paid Russian trolls who stopped posting on here was pushing that Clinton was involved with these guys but we soon found Assange and Wikileaks disparaging the leaking of information on these guys so we knew that wasn't true real quick.  \n\nWell, I am sorry but I believe this McClatchy article titled "[Inside Panama Papers: Multiple Clinton connections](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article72215012.html)" more than your words.  \n&nbsp;  \n>you defend Trump with your clearly bogus username  \n\nAgain, each time you want to depict me like this, I will disagree. I am no Trump supporter, but what MSM are currently doing is shameful and dishonest. They are depicting all of Trump's actions as terrible, tyrannic, xenophobic, and so on. Yet, every of his MSM-despised actions has been already done by some other (and even often) democratic president in the past and at that time, the president doing them was not slapped in the face like now. It is simply not correct for the media to not inform us correctly. I accept that there can be some bias in the different news outlets in way or another, but what they are doing now is simply ridiculous. So I am not defending Trump's policies or his persona, but I am standing against the systematic bullshit the MSM is serving us on Trump. Nothing more, nothing less.
Nasdrovie!
Well said. Pretty chilling when you think about it.
Wow! Cool down! That is illegal man! There is no place for such talk here. The Clintons must be investigated, prosecuted and convicted. This is /r/HillaryForPrison, not /r/IAmACriminalLikeTheClintons. There are tools in our society to deal with people like the Clintons. These tools exist within the rule of Law and are wielded by the people whose jobs are to enforce the Law. These tools are the ones to be used. We should never let people like the Clintons pollute our own moral and ethical values, even though it could help us take them down. In fact, it would mean they were victorious by contaminating us with their dirt and eventually they would be the ones shaping our world's values. That must not happen. We shall not and will not be what these people are: criminals. Because else, all of the Clintons' criminal actions would be justified by our own.

Most liberals recognize McCain is all talk and won't ever put his money where his mouth is. He's there to make the Republican party look less monolithic.

It's "than", not "then". 
I mean McCain is a giant piece of shit. I'm reserving judgement on this whole issue until I can see some real evidence. Too many interests at work here.\n\n(not a trump supporter)
Don't be hostile, man.  It's surprising that in a place that should be extremely skeptical of government, & governmental power, someone would be rooting for the government. 
This is LITERALLY fake news. Wake the fuck up you idiots.\n\nThis is not biased news, or partisan news, or even misinformed news, this is pure fake news and misinformation.

He already posted a, you guessed it, YouTube video.
..Will you guys\n\nWho the fuck are you?\n\n\nLookmomimretarded
And this is how you end up with an un-democratic non-elected 2nd shadow government. \nWe hardly know anything about our intelligence community & most of it is made up of hired private companies (check out the HBGary & Global Intelligence files on Wikileaks to get a taste of what their about. Also, remember Blackwater & Dyncorp?). How can we be sure they'll act impartially on the people's behalf if we don't know who they are, their motives (political or otherwise), & have used the secret FISA court to circumvent our govt representatives...that is until Obama's last executive order allowing warrantless intel sharing between all agencies/departments- fed & local.\nThe FBI already deems lawful assembly a reason to surveil citizens. If they have an agenda & silencing you helped that agenda, we'd never know- you'd be SOL. (whistleblowers would become hard to come by, too). The same scenario is a possibility in terms of the president, who is much more transparent than the intel community (no matter how secretive that president is).  
Some faggot who had his account created six days ago is saying ".Will you guys EVER"\n\nThat's who you are.\n\n What sub reddit do you hail from which makes you say  "will /r/conspriacy every stop bringing  up hillary"?

An apostrophe would have helped my reading comprehension 
McCain comes from a family of traitors, his Admiral dad was one of the responsibles for covering the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty that killed over 30 American sailors.
R/conspiracy is essentially an offshoot of r/the_donald. Let's not kid ourselves here. It's a shame too because the Russian hacking conspiracy might actually hold water,  but since it's "unverified information"  (ya know,  the thing that makes r/conspiracy what it is) the posts get removed. This sub has been garbage since they put Hitler on the sidebar for a month.

Good. I'm all for leaks. Keep them coming. Fuck everyone in the government.

I am related by marriage to a man that was in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain.\n\nHe told me he wouldn't vote for John McCain if he was running for a school board slot. And "John does what's best for John". \n\nWhich is a pretty damning statement, considering he was locked up with him for 7 1/2 years
probably a sekrit muslim too huh hot shot
I trust them when they source their articles, and I can judge their spin for myself.\n\nThis i would mark as a 3/10. I want to believe, but I am not sold.
giving arms to ISIS makes John McCain a traitor 
Ok but are the stories listed real or fake?
That's why it screams, 'EXCLUSIVE,' because no one else ever heard this bullshit before they came up with it...
You are a great example of stupidity incarnate.
> They had me at "White House fingers John McCain".\n\nI had to read that title 3 times to get that image out of my head
People here are anti government until a guy with their beliefs takes over.  Just look at how this sub reacts to anti trump conspiracies. Bunch of hypocrites. 
Super suggestive title.
Nice slide attempt.
Possible, but I doubt she does. 
Anytime, comrade!
maybe because followers of this Sub have been watching as McCain has constantly voted for foreign war, arming extremist rebels, increased spending on unnecessary/subpar  military Tech.  Basically, we know he does what ever benefits the few millitary Industrial warlords /CIA  that keep him in office while fucking over the average citizen with his voting record.
That's hostile? You should get out more.
oh yea dude john McCain is one of us! He knows what's best for everyone 
Suddenly /r/conspiracy is anti-leak
What?  I've never said that.  Maybe you can prove it since you're so sure.  I've never believed a word out of that jackasses face.  Obviously, you've got a problem with someone you have me confused with.  
That's hostile? You should get out more.
Listen, of you want to argue with my phones autocorrect go ahead. I've given up on that battle. Plus I really don't care :)
Hah, I love the constant attempt to paint them as some sort of sexual deviants. As if 99% of the earth's population isn't in to some sort of kink. Who cares what the personal lives of the people are? Disprove their work and I'll pay attention.
You don't think there are secrets any more? I highly doubt it. 
Send this guy back to the Vietkong. 
Wow, really.  Very interesting stuff.
I thought this was an open known thing happening.  \nObama moved back to D.C. to coordinate the shitshow.  \nPart of the reason why floor seven was fired.

Depends on what Trump gave away to Russia.
Yeah the way to go is to prevent the attacker from accessing your data in the first place because you've already lost if they have access. You use DLP to protect against employee mistakes.
"in an effort to damage Trump's presidency before it has a chance to succeed" - \n\nIt blew that chance faster than an addict blows thru a gram without any help from the Senator from Arizona. 
*(leans in)* WRONG!  He refused to be released sooner than the other POWs that were at "Hotel Hanoi" longer than him.  He was given preferential treatment from his captors because they found out that his father was a Navy admiral.\n\nHe's braver than all you turds over at The_Donald *COMBINED*!  
There are compartmentalized projects no doubt, but as an insider I can't see some super controversial  project being greenlighted
Wow. What a ham fisted garbage attempt at smearing a political opponent. Eavesdrop? What the ever living fuck? Bannon and Trump are such amateurs at this. They want to be Putin but end up acting like fucking morons. Unfortunately, the trump cult will probably eat this shit up with a spoon.
Inb4 you're brigaded. Hilarious because Trump is capitalist establishment all his friends are wall street elite, his cabinet us filled with billionaires, if anyone is out to secure the true $$ status quo besides Hilary it's Trump.
So that's where the "can't we just drone this guy" thing came from? Unnamed State Department sources to a shitty blog and people still treat it like gospel.\n\n
Trump first.
Putin will NOT tolerate dissent.\n\nHe is claiming what some may believe is the birthright of all Russians now.  The U.S.  (Oh, and our oil is nice too! My, have the roles flipped.)
This is a traitor to America, gave guns to ISIS, ratted out his fellow soldiers, and is betraying the Republican Party. Get this fucker out of here. \nIt's amazing to me the same media that shit on him a few years back is using him as a poster child for trump's resistance. \n\n
This has potential to be the greatest conspiracy most of them have been exposed too in their life though. haha.  top kek
Which one of you t_d champions wrote this article for the glorious leader?  Hilarious source 
hang him on the white house lawn
*Viet Cong*. Sheesh.
Nigga shut the absolute fuck up, my last account was banned from conspiracy because I mocked the blatant pro right rhetoric it magically started taking as soon as November hit. Who the fuck are you bro? If you can't defend Trump's failures WITHOUT bringing up Hillary Clinton, you are ADMITTING that your candidate can't do his job and you need a scapegoat. Self delusion is pathetic.
Y'all have gone off the deep end. If what he is saying is true, shouldn't the real conspiracy be the Trump Administration being in bed with Russia?
Just wanna say, great handle
im actually pretty proud of McCain if this is true
Nope.  You are easily fooled.  The man is a traitor, coward and liar.
I assume the boss also looks at your code or they probably use a auto-formatter. 
How impossible would it have been for the Obama administration to setup a secret group to investigate the Trump administration after Obama left office? A secret intelligence mission ordered by the Obama administration in the guise of protecting the country from potential Russian agents, spies and turncoats? \n\n
Trump first, party second, America eventually....
You're claiming McCain created ISIS? Traditional American foreign policy created ISIS, the same idiot policies that have persisted through the Vietnam War into contra shit in central America, Afghanistan, and northern Africa. We do barely any research and fund radicals for short term objectives then when they win exploit the subsequent power vacuums we're suddenly surprised that they wanna bomb other people like us. It's typical American foreign shortsightedness.
It's like when people first become atheists. Like stfu, you learned a fact virtually everyone knew.
My original reply had the fucking domain misspelled when I did a WHOIS, since I was reading another comment that had the same domain misspelled.

Source?
McCain is a warmonger coward traitor. 
I've seen this accusation of McCain a few times this month. You got a source for it?
If that is true, why can't you provide a user name for "my last account?" It's doubtful it was your 'real name,' but might add some credibility beyond the classic "Nigga shut the absolute fuck up." That is the type of statement that just screams valid point to so many of us...\n
Songbird McCain. Try him for treason.
Not a great source.
*IF* this is true, is it grounds for treason?
probably wasn't really tortured
Thanks.
>extremely skeptical of the government\n\nHave you not seen r/conspiracy front page?
Clearly it was McCain, we can't show you evidence but the way it was done was similar to the way McCain has spied before. S/
Not hard to believe with the Groper-in-Chief in the Oval Office.
do you think his daughter knows (if its true)? or in denial? Shes FOX news contributor 
I hope they used a latex glove.
I'm mostly an NPR, Al-Jazeera, and New Yorker kind of slut 
> he would do anything and everything possible to bring Trump down.\n\nBecause he's a patriot!  I don't agree with his policies, but I don't question the man's patriotism.
That was epic. 
Shit source, but, I can can totally see McCain being the song bird.\nJohn McCain is a stooge and he would do anything and everything possible to bring Trump down.\n\nHe's still pissed that he lost the election a couple years back and Trump is the Commander in Chief now.\n\nHe's the type of guy that thinks, "I deserve this, I've been here longer and don't forget I'm a POW war hero dammit".\n\nMcCain is and always be a fraud.
Agreed, but it is SO hard to believe in a "truthiness" website that was started by a couple into kinky sex, and one of the founders is now married to an ex-escort/porn actress who is one of the staff...I know.

Regardless of veracity, its definitely attempt to smear a political rival.

Ah, farm fresh bullshit. This right here is propaganda. Got a political opponent speaking out against you? Experiencing dissent from an internal party member? This is how you convince your people to ignore them. I mean, they're a traitor after all!
TRUEPUNDIT is fake 
> McCain even acted to prevent other POW's from coming home.\n\nNo he didn't. 
I guarantee alt righters are crying "harassment" right now
Very impossible. You don't know how the intelligence community works. Everything is actually super regulated and is made up of people like you and me. By its very nature it has to be obscured to protect methods and sources but that doesn't mean it has free reign to do what it wants anymore. Maybe back in the 60s or 70s when crazy shit like MKULTRA was going on but the IC is like a normal bureaucracy now because of leaks and oversight.

someone just this morning posted a similar article saying it was some other lady in the WH.... this article needs more than just 1 quote by "an insider" to convince me. cmon this looks lazy
Thank god for John McCain then.
He criticizes daddy so he's got to go. 
But you don't *have* to believe anything.  You don't have to *trust* anything - you can just look at the evidence.\n\nFor example, this True Pundit story about Coretta Scott King. \n\nTrue Pundit said:\n\n> But now a more recent video has surfaced where Coretta King in fact praises Sessions at the launching of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.\n\n[The video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=5xQznIj8g6U), and as Snopes points out, she did not mention Sessions.
Did they finger him in that chipmunk cheek? I would!
Please not be fake news. Please not be fake news.
Says the guy living in his Mom's basement who never served.  
You did better than me!
The one thing he is especially in...is in your head. Living rent free.
This shows how important it is to source things yourself. If snipes references something go to that reference. Generally they're okay, you just have to do some leg work
Yea I'm totally surprised people have varying opinions too. What a world we live in eh?
But seriously the intelligence agencies should be monitoring the presidents too, especially after Nixon.
Agreed. Only source reporting it too. Unverifiable.
John McCain, master hacker.  I think he is part of Antonymous.
*They're fake* ... they will give opposite marks for the same comments depending on party who's quoted.
They had me at "White House fingers John McCain".
Yea... Mc Cain.... wasn't that the same cunt who hacked merkels phone ? 
Betraying the Republican party makes you a traitor to America? Its hard to believe this kind of proestablishment extremism is appearing and upvoted in /r/conspiracy.
Really like he picked up another phone in the White House? What is this 1980 this is true FAKE NEWS.
If McCains prank call actually contained information that pointed to him as the leaker it would have been included in the article. Instead we don't get a link or even a quote from the conversation...
Oh YES!  This is what I wanted to see. Burn that motherfucker!  And Graham too! 
Or how to get them to finger the real culprit?
I'm surprised that someone on /r/conspiracy is interesting in letting the gov't try anyone for treason
shit source. I'm no fan of mccain but this seems like a pretty obvious attempt to silence the dissenters. 
The IC isn't so opaque for those with a ts/sci clearance as it is for the civilian. I'm not going to wax arrogant that there's nothing going on that I don't know about, like I said I'm a regular type dude -- however I do have a privileged understanding of how the IC works generally
Are they just basing this on the prank phone call those Russians did to McCain the other day?  He was talking some shit, surprised he didn't get something for it.\n\nPS: Truepundit was a decent source during the Hillary DNC days.  I seem to recall them publishing things that weren't in MSM and were verifiable and true.
And trump would know if he would just listen to his intelligence briefings. But alas that's harder then watching fox news :o
White House fingers John McCain?  GROSS
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Their work is mostly good.
Wait. So the CIA is run by ants?...... I freakin' knew it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hr37eE0nO8\n\nIt's described by about a dozen people here.
RemindMe!  3 days "Is trupundit.com a shit source or an awesome source?"
False, the IC is largely civilians and military members like me, contractors make up like less than 30 percent. FISA courts have oversight by Congress and the attorney general. Intelligence sharing still can't break laws and upholds search and seizure rights, now if you think Metadata is illegal that's another story and you can argue it all day, still the NSA can't do what the FBI can do for example. It's funny how mundane and boring the IC is once you actually can see how it works. I understand why you'd be suspicious but do some research into 12333 and USSID 18 and it will become clearer. Edit: Contractors have a very specialized role in the IC and the executives and Chiefs are either civilian DoD workers or Military members.
Wonderfully ironic coming from a Trumpette whose electronic butt plug ties in directly to Trump's twitter notification. 
> Really like he picked up another phone in the White House?\n\nAre you the guy who provided Hillary with the "Like with a cloth or something?" line?
Domains by proxy is just a standard reg proxy service. It's perfectly normal to hide your registrant details.     I do it on my domains as I can't be bothered with the 'do you want to sell this domain?' Or millions of Indian 'hello friend, we build websites' spam. 
Well yeah but Jonny is clearly going against emperor trump!  You have to understand all the_d  readers that come to this sub are very pro establishment now!  Also LOL at this source. 
I love when you idiots claim CIA is some fucking monolith that persists through generations, the top brass in the CIA comes and goes like every 8 years, do you know how the intelligence community works? I'm in the IC and we're not some drones following some shadowy cabal, I'm a normal dude with my own beliefs and opinions.
It's scar tissue from when he had a cancerous tumor removed from his cheek.  And now he's removing a cancerous tumor from the White House!
He's a war hero you shut your mouth /s
McCain even acted to prevent other POW's from coming home.  It's shocking more people don't know about this man's very checkered past.
I don't believe anything on Snopes after the Democratic primaries.  They showed their bias. Same with NPR.

A couple of years ago, I was talking to a security researcher who did some work investigating how the Great Firewall of China worked internally. Her research had showed that whoever wrote the code for the Great Firewall must have written their own TCP/IP stack because they didn't use a secure random number generator. I asked her why they might have wanted to do this, and she said her Chinese colleagues told her that the Chinese government paid their programmers per lines of code written.\n\nFor those who don't know, implementing the TCP/IP stack is an enormous undertaking.
Calexit is not about California is not trying to secede unilaterally the way the confederate states did. If the ballot passes, CA is supposed use its economic strength as leverage to lobby in DC and state legislatures for a constitutional amendment which would allow CA to leave the union peacefully. \n\nYou are right, constitutionally states rights do not include the right to leave the union. This was settled 150 years ago. CA is trying amend to leave via constitutional amendment.
Enterprises who do MITM middleboxes typically have good reason for doing it, such as preventing data exfiltration.

Wow what a retard. \n\nThat check is clearly handwritten. In fact that box is meant for whoever is signing it to fill in. It has to be handwritten.\n\nYou're telling me that whoever forged this document, created, forged the signatures, realized they forgot to put the check there, and put it there digitally using fucking Adobe editor? They were like "fuck it, close enough, it's only the President's birth certificate, nobody is gonna notice." Is this fucking plausible to you? \n\nOpen your mind, stop falling for bullshit rhetoric. 
That might be case where it's OK. If your while true loop is actually meant to be an infinite loop, i.e. the program lives inside that loop until it's time to exit, then I that's OK. \n\nThe problem when people use while-true loops for normal control flow they could have easily written with a little reordering and a do-while loop. \n
Yeah this is how it works. An airplane has real-time software on it. All real-time software is difficult to write because it has to meet meet real-time deadlines, so it's usually always written in a slow, methodical way. An airplane and a car has what's called "hard" real-time, which means missing a deadline is a catastrophic failure. Whereas your graphics card runs "soft" real-time code that has to meet a deadline every ~17ms to refresh the display, but nobody dies if deadlines are missed. \n\nHow NASA writes code is they first draw everything out, then they describe the overall function of each component, then they describe how each one works, then they actually write detailed pseudocode in meetings which gets revised and revised, only when everyone agrees on these huge pseudocode books, does anyone start writing actual code that will run on a space shuttle. They can achieve incredibly low error rates like this, but take insanely long to do it. 
Haha my dear friend. \n\nRadfems inherently believe that men are violent and dangerous and approach men with fear and distrust, if not outright hatred. Trans-exclusionary radical feminism rejects the notion that transwomen should get the same treatment feminism gives to women and claims that transwomen are equally guilty of everything bad associated with men, because they are really men.\n\nTERFs believe that transwomen are really just men who've tricked themselves into believing their cross-dressing fetish is their true gender identity. Their end goal is justifying why they do not want transwomen (who they see as men) in women's bathrooms, i.e. because transwomen are men and men are rapists. 
Definitely check out the Blindbox paper, it was a really cool read!  Here's a link:\n\nhttp://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2015/pdf/papers/p213.pdf\n\nIt's definitely not ready to implement just yet, but proposes some really fresh ideas.
Anytime you've written something like\n\n    while (true) {\n      thing();  \n      if (condition) break;\n    }\n\nIt probably would have been better off as a do-while loop.\n\nEDIT: Bonus. If you find yourself doing this:\n\n    do_thing()  \n    while (condition)  \n       do_thing() \n\nYou should really consider a do while loop. 
Go fuck yourself you're not welcome in my country.

It's cuz they use the cheapest materials that will be strong enough. What were you expecting a carbon fiber pull-out couch? 
This is not going to pass, and the Dems haven't controlled congress since 2010 and back then the conversation was much different.
I totally agree with everything you're saying. I fully understand that optimized code is more lines than a naive approach. I'm not saying that Windows 95 is better than Windows 10 because its fewer lines of code, I totally get that Windows 10 has to be so much bigger. \n\nWhat I'm saying really isn't on a per programmer basis. The reason I'm saying huge codebases are bad is because it's caused entirely by not planning the structure of the software beforehand and each programmer/team reinventing the wheel, leading to replicated code and unnecessary components. That's what causes code bloat, not individual programmers writing big programs. It's unorganized codebases that's the issue. Because hiring lots of bad programmers who don't care and quickly shipping software that works is cheaper for these companies than hiring good programmers who do care. 
Because it's really easy to implement. Do loops are identical to while loops in assembly except while loops have an extra jump at the beginning. \n\nAlso they're not stupid rare, it's just that we're used to coding without using them. They're useful if you know your loop needs to happen at least once or you want avoid loop priming, or you want to avoid the off-by-one. A lot of while-true loops that have the if-break statement would be better off as do-while loops.
you can also send yourself a snap lol
I'm going to disagree with you here. It does mean those things, but having worked in the industry for so long, enterprise software companies, the enormous size of these software teams means code gets written without planning or coordination which leads to codebases 10x-20x bigger than they need to be. \n\nSame problem with open-source software.
No, it's the other way around. Russian intelligence officers and the Russian ambassador was being spied on. That's how the FBI realized the Trump campaign was talking to them.

> we also intentionally leave somethings for future archaeologists. Because we know their methods will be significantly better than ours.\n\nWow that's incredible! Is this a widespread approach in archaeology? Really says a lot about your respect for history and science. 
Not that this is going to pass, but.\n\nYou're talking about 2008 when the conversation about MJ was so different. There was only a handful of medical states and no recreational states. Nobody had any idea that in just 4 years, a state would actually legalize. It was still seen as a horrible gateway drug by most people, most people didn't know you couldn't overdose on it and its medical benefits virtually unknown to the general public.\n\nDems lost control of the House in 2010, they haven't had it since. Also the president can't unilaterally legalize it, congress needs to do it.

I disagree, TIRF doesn't actually exist. Trans exclusion is inherent to radical feminism because radfem sees sex as the single most divisive factor between people in terms of social class. \n\nIntersectional feminism was born as a reaction against radical feminism and it's utter dismissal of all other factors that can cause a person to be at a disadvantage. Radfem failed because people realized that, in fact, struggles of cishet white women weren't in fact the most important (lol).
OP your title is wrong. It's 100 pounds for a 4-hour visit and 69k pounds for a lifetime membership. Article says its only 3,271 pounds for an annual membership.
I'd assume most of it is not dead code. A much bigger program is code replication. When 400 engineers work on a program, which is a low number for these huge programs, they typically work in teams of 20-30 where each team has a different job. \n\nSay you're on team A, and to implement what you're doing you realize you need some specialized data structure, like a thread-safe queue or some weird shit. You can ask your teammates if they have anything similar, but chances are they won't. But Brenda on some other team has already written a thread-safe queue months ago, but you don't talk to her because she didn't hold the door for you that one time. Or you don't understand which methods in Leonard's queue are blocking. So you go and write your own. \n\nThis happens so much in huge teams. Typically all features implement their own utility code.
It's a black bear for sure.

There's definitely watermarking techniques and companies that sell such patented solutions, but there is no way for it to survive encryption. Encryption schemes we use today are mathematically proven to produce outputs indistinguishable from random data. \n\nIf the attacker is already on your network, you probably can't stop them from exfiltrating data. The point of watermarking is to prevent well-meaning employees from accidentally leaking data. You can watermark compressed/encrypted files but if the attacker on your network knows you have a middlebox, then you probably can't stop them. 
That's totally true. I really don't want normal people to think of lines of code as an accomplishment. \n\n"Wow Windows is 50 million lines of code? Microsoft is so amazing." \n\nNo it's bloated garbage.
I'm not following you here. /r/GenderCritical is a disgusting cesspool of TERFs (Trans-exclusionary radical feminists) and similar extreme idiocy.

It's literally the same shit as neonazis spamming race crime stats. \n\nOne of the rules of their sub is "no links to right-wing websites" where they include everydayfeminism.com as right-wing websites.\n\nI do not understand how OP's post wasn't deleted immediately or how that was meant to promote an anti-feminist game. 
Data caps will go up when the base station gets higher aggregate bandwidth. This will happen after 5G deployment. \n\nCaps are there because you can't really buy a fixed service rate like 100MB/s with cell phone towers. Your instantaneous speed depends on how many people are simultaneously trying to talk to the base station. If there were no data caps, you would experience much slower speeds.
You can rotate this into a do-while, but you either have to repeat input.frob() before the loop, or rig frob to handle when input is uninitialized. Much better pattern imo:\n\n    do {\n        var input = thing();\n    } while (input.frob()); \n\nWhere `input.frob()` returns false if input is bad. 
On the face of it, this is true. But there's a context and a historical background to those statistics. Racists and neo-nazis want you to think that criminal behavior is something "biologically" inherent to a given race, and there is absolutely zero data supporting such racist claims. Presenting the data without a discussion of the underlying historical and societal factors that make the statistics what they are is racist and it is something neo nazis do. 
Hey OP, this is retarded. \n\nHow to fix:\n\nOption A. Move it above ground or partially above ground and install a real door on one side of the container, as well as better ventilation.\n\nOption B. Get rid of the container entirely and build an concrete bunker in its place. The fact is, that thing is not structurally sound and needs to be encased in some sort of structural shell. If you're gonna do that, you might as well get rid of it, and actually build a real structure. \n\nBuilding codes exist for a reason, start over and try to obey them. 
I kept accidentally triggering siri too. Since I literally never use Siri, I changed the right most button to be mute and added the screenshot button to the touchbar on the left side. Haven't had problems since.\n\n\n
No. In 2015, state legislature passed a statewide ban on grocery stores giving out or selling single use plastic bags. The law allows grocery stores to sell reusable paper bags for not less than $0.10. \n\nThis law was contested, but it was upheld after the 2016 proposition passed. \n\nClothing stores are not affected by this, only grocery stores. Restaurants and retail stores can still give out plastic bags.
Go off yourself like Hitler did.
Having done it before, it's not that bad if you have a simple congestion control algorithm, and don't implement most TCP options. I think you can implement a simple TCP stack in roughly ~2000 lines. If you ignore most TCP and IP options, it should not take more than a few weeks for a few developers to do it. \n\nIt's definitely tricky to implement and test. I would spend a huge amount of time upfront to set up some testing framework, perhaps inside some network emulator. 
Can't tell if you're arguing for open borders or ethnic nationalism.
No, with something like AES, it's proven that no adversary can distinguish the ciphertext from a randomly generated bitstring with a non-negligible probability (less than ~1/2^80 ), even when you give the adversary the power to see the ciphers of a large number of chosen plaintexts. Look up the definition of chosen plaintext attack (CPA) security. 
That's really not how it works. \n\nI see that picture all the time in college dorms and shitty bachelor pads. It's tacky. It looks cheap. \n\nSure it's a nice looking picture. But it's like the wall art equivalent of saying Michael Bay is your favorite director, Taylor Swift is your favorite musician and 50 shades of gray is your favorite book . There's nothing wrong enjoying any of these things, but do you really want to represent yourself to other people? Do you want them to think your only interests are the absolute most mainstream stuff possible? 
Now you're saying Iran and Syria are not expansionist?
Customs dogs are beagles lol
And they drink sake.
RIDF confirmed GTFO
It does not work if you encrypt the document. \n\nFingerprinting/watermarking is meant to prevent accidental data exfiltration or "data loss", not a malicious attacker who is already on your private network.
Trans-exclusionary radical feminism (TERF). Radical feminists who believe there's only two genders, the good one and bad one. Radical feminism comes from intense hatred, fear and distrust of men. It's not like your every day feminism where we need to make everyone equal, they believe every aspect of everyday society was deliberately and maliciously designed by men to enslave and oppress women. They are sex-negative: they think pornography and sex work are both examples of violence against women for the sexual pleasure of men on a massive scale. \n\nTERFs go one step further and exclude transsexuals from radical feminism. TERFs have concluded that transwomen are not at all women, in fact they call them MtT as opposed to MtF. They believe they are in fact just male fetishists who get off to dressing as a woman, which they call auto-gynephilia. They genuinely think this about transwomen who are attracted to women. They also think transmen (which they call FtT) are just tomboyish girls or butch lesbians who got tricked by the trans activists into thinking they're actually men instead of embracing their female strength. \n\n/r/GenderCritical is a subreddit for TERFs, but they for some reason go really hard on trans-exclusion topics and trans hate and less vocal about men bashing. It's pretty crazy, they actually upvote male radfems and cheer them for bashing trans people. 
One of my all-time favorite strips: http://imgur.com/a/yJS93
I cannot imagine how those squares were all cut so precisely. Like I believe that it was possible and that they did it, but it's really not obvious how someone would go about accomplishing this. \n\nIt's not like they could have spent a whole week agonizing over making perfect cubes, food photography is extremely delicate and requires everything to be prepped fast and shot quickly, because most food stuff starting becoming unsightly within an hour, it sure as hell isn't going to look this fresh.\n\nAnd they couldn't have used a simple cutting set-up either, all these cubes have different textures and consistencies, no way this could be done with standard cutting tools.\n\nYou see how it's vastly easier and cheaper to just fake this. Hell, even shooting each cube individually and photoshopping this scene together would have been far far easier. But the fact that all these cubes were somehow perfectly cut within a few hours, then perfectly arranged without requiring do overs, and then the photographer had enough time to mess with the lightning, angle, lenses to get this shot? It's pretty fucking crazy.
LOL stop shilling your shitty product. \n\n>If they were mass produced via factory your complaint would be valid, but we are offering a different value than Chinese made wallets.\n\nReally? Are you sure the wallets aren't mass produced in a factory in China? Would you stand by that statement? Because I just searched alibaba for men's wallet and lo and fucking behold found the exact same wallet for $3-$10:\n\n[https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wallet-Slots-men-wallet-2015-with_60508639333.html](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Wallet-Slots-men-wallet-2015-with_60508639333.html)\n\nThere's pictures of the fucking Chinese factory where your wallets are made on that page.\n\nAlso found it on AliExpress for $4.87 each:\n\n[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Exports-New-style-mens-brand-designer-leather-luxury-purse-wallet-short-cross-high-quality-wallets/1896730826.html](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Exports-New-style-mens-brand-designer-leather-luxury-purse-wallet-short-cross-high-quality-wallets/1896730826.html)\n\nLiterally GTFO with your craptastatic product. This subreddit is for actually nice products not for you to shill your crappy garbage. I genuinely hope you haven't scammed anyone into paying $60 for that piece of crap.\n\nEDIT: Do not listen to this loser, the Alibaba page says they do custom colors and the embossed logo is optional/custom. Literally everything else about the two wallets are identical, the design of the pockets, the card holder, the print of the leather etc.\n\nNot to mention, the custom "designs" on his website are obviously photoshopped. This guy is a legit scammer.
I think he becomes illegal the moment he stops working for them actually.
Food as well. I want all their food now.

This is not true at all, eggs may be fertilized or not, but if you collect eggs every morning, then any eggs in that batch that happen to be fertilized will die and won't be any different from unfertilized eggs.\n\nIn industrial egg factories, the egg chickens never get to see a rooster so eggs are always unfertilized. But if you buy from smaller free-range producers or from small farms at the farmers market, chances are some of your eggs are dead fertilized eggs.
Are you being serious?
Sure then just run wireshark on a separate machine, problem solved but yeah. 
Great article, it might have gotten me into scalping. It's ridiculously easy to buy festival tickets and flip them. 
Data plans depend on the aggregate bandwidth of cellular base stations. When the base stations can talk to phones in the area at 1 terabit (as proposed with 5G), you will see cellular data become much cheaper. 
"These liberals won't let me say racist shit without calling me rascist."
Yeah but like old people use this shit. They're literally trying to scam old people into using their shitty products so they can make money.
You were just arguing that. \n\nThe problem is, if Assad wins the Syrian civil war, it's very bad for US geopolitical interests. It means a coalition of Russia, Syria, Iran, Yemen and Iraq will suddenly become the most powerful actor in the region. Syria and Iran could easily annex Turkey and bring themselves to Europe.

Jack in the Box is absolutely inedible. It's like a cheap version of Taco Bell with food that tastes much worse. How such a thing exists bewilders me. I wouldn't go there unless I was stupid high and completely wasted and had absolutely no other options. \n\nI need to start a Jack in the Box hate group. 
You can do this with pretty much any language (except python). Most languages ignore whitespace all together. But humans don't code like that so lines of code is a good metric .to measure the rough size of a project. \n\nHell I don't even write code generators that generate code like that. 
Wow that's fucked up. This is like straight-up white supremacist neo-nazi garbage, how the media is trying to discourage white people from having kids. I can't believe none of the comments are calling them out. I guess /r/altright just migrated back.
Grocery stores are not allowed to give or sell you plastic bags at all in CA. \n\nOther places like restaurants and retail stores can give you free plastic bags. 
I think your criticisms are a bit too harsh. I love how bright the screen is, I actually prefer the hardness of the keys (they do not make my fingers hurt at all (I love the keyboard actually) and have never accidentally hit the trackpad, palm detection has always worked for me. Also, I definitely see the touchbar having a lot of potential for moving away from keyboard shortcuts. It's not a gimmick at all, once Chrome, iTerm2 and sublime text support it, I'll definitely use it all the time. Currently I use it multiple times a day to type emojis. 
Holy fuck that 3rd post and the guys suicide post linked in the comments hit me hard.
>They cost 10 cents. The law says they must charge you, but it doesn't say what they have to do with there own money.\n\nI'm not too sure about that. I'm not a lawyer but I'm pretty sure that violates the spirit of the law. 
Wow wait, this shit is happening on my Mac too. That's super fucked.
I genuinely hope that non-programmers realize this: more lines of code is a bad thing. It's a terrible thing. \n\nUnfortunately, over the last 20-30 years, software companies have transitioned from small dedicated team of engineers writing small programs, with good, efficient code to 300 engineer teams writing huge, bloated programs with terrible code quality. In a way, this has allowed programs to do much more than before, be easier to use and look prettier, but has also made it near impossible for the programmers to fix existing problems with their software. \n\nIt's absolutely horrifying to me (as a systems programmer) that the modern operating system has 60+ million lines of code. 
This is because people don't use 4G as much. If more people used it, it would be slow as fuck.
Thanks Capt. Hindsight!
A transwoman is someone who was assigned male at birth, but later reassigns to female. They're saying that even though transwomen think they're women and go on hormone therapies, they're really just as dangerous and violent as cis men and should not be allowed into women's bathrooms and women's spaces. 
When people write while true loops, they forget to break, or they break in the wrong place. Common source of bug.\n\nWhen people look at a while loop, they want to immediately understand the loop condition. while-true-if-break loops are hard to read especially with multiple breaks.\n\nWhen you have a while true loop that isn't meant to loop forever, it's confusing, because people expect while-true loops to loop.\n\nWhat the above loop does is ensure that the loop body executes at least once, and then keeps executing while the condition is true. This is exactly the scenario do-while loops are meant for.
I get better speeds in the US (typically 50-100Mbps) but my plan costs $100 per month. The problem is that the US is enormous compared to Denmark. Several times a year I fly to New York and Chicago and get the same service at no additional cost in those cities.\n\nSimilarly, Europeans mostly live in cities where it's much easier to get service to everyone. Americans are spread out and often commute long distances so getting 100% coverage to a person throughout their day requires more towers and costs more.
Your boss is a piece of shit for asking this. Software engineers actually spend their lives working on that software. They have to charge for it, because it cost a lot of money and expertise to create. But they know students at universities cannot pay them in full, so they sell it to them at a discount.\n\nThis software wouldn't exist if it were for people like your boss.
I'm sorry, but if they have this really nice place, they should not have the tacky Eiffel tower ikea wall art up on the wall. It just looks super cheap. It's not hard to find affordable wall art that isn't Ikea approved.
And Bakersfield. Absolutely do not go there. Besides the oil, you can smell the cow shit from miles away.

Same with rape reports at US universities. Sweden crime statistics report rape reports not convictions. 
An attacker could encrypt the sensitive data, if its already on the network and has access to the network. It doesn't need to launch a new application, the malware can already ship with code for encryption in it. \n\nThis only prevents accidental data exfiltration, not malicious attackers.
Neither of them considered removing our missile systems from Europe and dissing NATO, two biggest stop holding back Russian aggression. Let alone actually loosening sanctions to appease Putin.
>If you don't have complete software but can't add the code needed to finish it because that would be "terrible" then you are stuck with an unfinished application. Taking it to the extreme, you never start coding because 1 line > 0 lines, 1 > 0 therefore it's "bad" and "terrible".\n\nThat's not what I was saying at all or what the other guy was saying.\n\n>whitespace, comments,\n\nNeither counts against line count.\n\n>multiple for or while loops instead of just making one\n\nThis might be fine for scripting, but this is a great example of why writing more lines of code both introduces more bugs and runs slower. This is not OK if you're writing systems software like operating systems, databases, browsers and it's extremely not OK for "hard" real-time software like for a plane or car.\n\n>Further, if I spent more time cleaning up my scripts, I'd have less time to do what's more important for my job\n\nYou do realize we're talking about software companies that write software right? Writing good software is their business. 
Lol no. It's not particularly distinguishing or unique to like stuff that's extremely unoffensive and designed to be pleasing to the max number of people. It's boring and uninteresting. It's the equivalent of serving dino-nuggets for your guests at a dinner party. 
But there's two more on the mirror!
The iPhone battery easily lasts a week in airplane mode. Turn the brightness all the way down, turn off data and use it just for calls and texts, it will last pretty long.
The reason companies typically do deep packet inspection is to prevent data exfiltration. Typically all sensitive data is "watermarked" so the middle boxes can tell when data that shouldn't be leaving the companies private network is about to leave the network unless stopped.\n\nThis and prevent known malware from entering the system. 
Exactly what will happen sadly

Was in the dorms at the presidio in Monterey CA, this is where the military sends their linguists to learn a language, suffice it to say those that are linguists are often not the most socially adept and somewhere a good few are on the spectrum. My roommate was what we call a "Space Cadet" or a "Low-Speed", besides doing karate routines in his whitey tighties, he was generally impossible to hold a conversation with. One night I was playing on my computer and had my headphones on, but I heard peculiar noises and movement regardless. Hmm, I wonder, what is my challenging to say the least roomie up to. I get up and head to our shared bathroom, our room is quite small and very open. Space Cadet is butt naked, and this is the only descriptor that comes to mind, MASHING his penis to hentai, with zero subterfuge involved in masking his regrettable activity in the presence of others. It was like he was playing with playdo, he was doing something to his penis I did not think conscionable for anyone who has a modicum of vested interest in continuing his hereditary line. Tl;dr roommate was kneading his penis like  pizza dough butt naked with the lights on with complete disregard to anything else.\n\nAs a fellow man, im still traumatized at his total disrespect of the art of masturbation.

I doubt much will change from a company that pushes for profits and stock value as aggressively as Hasbro and Wizards. They are consistently criticized for having a cash cow in MTGO but improperly and insufficiently supporting its growth and improvement. They are notoriously known in professional circles as having toxic work environments and uncompetitive salaries. Between Banlists, reserve lists, programming faults, alleged collusion with 2nd party merchants, testing issues, God the list goes on with this company, that they'd honestly put money into their product such as hiring more testers?\n\nEdit: I'm sure the insulation that this subreddit provides due to the mods making sure they're in Hasbro's good graces doesn't actually benefit the game either

Well than they should learn to play as a team and focus the hog or healer down, any coordinated team can destroy a great hog, and this is coming from someone who climbed around 800sr with him. I ended around 50 away from diamond, which is when people learn to focus me down first or before a full team engage. Hog is only overpowered if the enemy team has no bubnle/shield/matrix (being fixed) or communication. \n\nI was ecstatic when hook 2.0 came out because it fixed so much inconsistency and even happier when I heard the dva ptr patch for her matrix, he was balanced without this nerf, especially with the dva buff. At least imo, I'm open to arguments on this.  \n\nEdit: A good genji, widow, or hanzo isn't fun and can wreck a team single handedly. Yet I don't call for them to be nerfed because of this. 
It's just logical, I put a little blanket or something soft to rest it on because both sides of my case are glass and I don't think it'll shatter without it but it will scratch. \n\nIt doesn't move around while driving because it's a full tower I think (760t) so its always fine. Actually getting it to the car is the biggest pain in the ass
> Yeah, being in the correct position on the high ground as soldier and then getting hooked because Roadhog throws it in my general direction is absolutely fun to play against\n\nStill complaining about something that was fixed means you were out too far in the open or didn't start backing off when the road was heading straight toward you 
> I agree with this sentiment, but I also think that heroes who are not fun to play against just need a complete rework. Roadhog is in that category.\n\nI think the problem we have here is that it's Roadhog himself, rather than his kit which has backed blizzard into a corner. Nerf his hook too much and it could defeats the purpose of his kit, buff his shotgun and self heal and he becomes too tanky and doesn't fit a role that others can do better. Honestly, my above suggestions are the best way to balance him "as is". Emphasis on as is until they do a full rework on him like they did to symmettra, but the thing is they would have to deviate from the lore and character they created around him to do so. :I\n\n>I think one thing that would massively improve this hero and force him into more of a tank role is if he was somehow rewarded for hooking someone to protect a teammate rather than just to get a pick.\n\nI relate to this on soo many levels. I've really started to capitalize on protecting teammates rather than trying to go for picks and end up having my hook on CD while my healer/squishy is in trouble. Same goes for counter pig, hog hooks someone, I right click and hook to save whoever he hooked. It's almost comparable to zarya focusing on using her bubbles aggressively rather than defensively. You'll get more value out of her by playing defensively with your teammates, especially against a hog.\n\n>Maybe if he hook didn't create one shot potential but stopped the player from shooting or healing for x seconds and gave ultimate charge based on the damage or healing prevented.\n\nWe should start a rework brainstorming thread on hog on potential ways to rework his kit. Right now his kit is insanely hard to balance and nobody will be pleased when the upcoming changes are pushed live except those who actually get hooked. I don't want hog to go the way of Dva/Winston/Junkrat/etc, buffed, then nerfed too much leading to low pick rates
> I've spent all required information to Nexus, it's on their side now. I'd say a few days, perhaps ?\n\nBest of luck with whatever's happening :)
> comparing a 10+m low skill instakill abilities to other abilities that are nothing like it and then personally blaming me for Hog nerfs\n\nSo a flashbang right click isn't low skill? You clearly can't hold an actual substantive argument so I'm done wasting energy on this.
I mean let's be honest here, if you're a developer doing a gameplay walkthrough of abilities and mechanics you sure as hell aren't going to be doing it on hard, you're going to do it on easy to spend the least amount of time getting the shots right. That's such a silly thing to judge based off a trailer introducing abilities.\n\nBut the animations, yeah, not sure wtf is going on there
Yeah, because they'll surely be successful living in halfway houses and no permanent parent figure they can trust instead of just their mom. Oh and don't forget the wonderful emotional issues they'll have that the state won't treat. But sure. They'll be fine

> No, your religion doesn't require you to have abortions.\n\nNo. But it says that it isn't a sin and is generally allowed. People can vote based on their religious beliefs, but people generally should not be allowed to use their religion as a basis for why they advocate for something. Use a logical argument, not, my book that I read says this is bad so now everyone must suffer whether you believe my religion or not.\n\n>What it means is that the government isn't allowed to impose religion on you. \n\nSo when senators come out and say god told me that abortion is a sin and should be outlawed from this country (Paraphrasing Ted Cruz), is that not exactly what you say isn't allowed? That he is imposing his religion on us? Or when Trump says America is a Judeo-Christian nation even though this country was founded on the basis of freedom of religion and seculurism?\n\n>But if enough people voted against abortion, for whatever reason, then it would be an issue of negative rights, and you could be prevented from engaging in that act because the population collectively deemed it to be abhorrent.\n\nWhich would be fine if people weren't using their religion as an argument against it. Fact of the matter is, the people arguing against it probably couldn't come up with a good enough argument that doesn't include their religion telling them what to do or why they believe in it. This is my main problem with anti-abortion people, it's that they can't give me a good enough argument against abortion aside from you'll go to hell for killing babies or some dumb shit.\n\n>Also, the essence of the Republican party platform is in no way meant to control the woman's body, but to prevent the woman from killing what the party recognizes as a human life.\n\nSo then if they aren't trying to control the woman's body, then why not give the woman herself to choose what she wants to do with the human life she carries and let her choose if she wants to carry the burden of the abortion? Right. They can't, because they are controlling her body by right of preventing a choice in the first place.

Any long range hero dominates hog, play smart, not forward, coming from a hog main, he can easily be punished if you take him him on from a ledge or high ground.

Such a character simply abuses his overtuned abilities.\n\nA coordinated team or even just semi-coordinated team will beat any level hog aside from GM level anyday of the week. You can't get hook, you can't get pick. You bait hook, hog is vunerable, you know, biggest hitbox in the game and such. Do you have a decent zarya? Decent Rein or DVA? Good Ana? Congrats, you have just countered hog at the most basic level. \n\nNext.
> Honestly it might be a map design problem instead. I feel every game needs a reinhardt. Without one, Hog gets free hooks because at basically any engagement he can peak a corner and get a kill.\n\nThis is absolutely a reasoning I agree with, hog is less effective on Oasis because of the fact that there aren't a lot of sharp corners or flanks/large chokepoints to hook through

It's an extra $20 for the RX470 which is an average of 25 fps ahead of the 1050ti, plus better DX12 support. And then an extra $20 for the RX480 which is an even bigger beast.\n\nCards I recommend for your price range:\n\nRX470: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JM2DFLC/?tag=pcpapi-20&th=1\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JS2UFDM/?tag=pcpapi-20 \n\nRX480: http://pcpartpicker.com/product/84M323/msi-radeon-rx-480-4gb-gaming-x-video-card-radeon-rx-480-gaming-x-4g (4gb model)\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KCWZ0DM/ref=psdc_284822_t2_B01MU0OIN5 (8gb @239.99)\n\nGTX 1060: Same manufacturers, same price as the 8gb model above\n\nSo the choices are RX470 at around $170-180 or save up a little bit for the RX480 or 1060 @$230. If you do not choose to save for the 480/1060, go for the 470 as it's soo much better than the 1050ti
> You compared the hook mechanic to the ones used in some other games. But in none of those other games, is the person with the hook allowed to one-shot whoever they hit.\n\nTrue. I'll concede that point, but that's more a problem with the kit Blizzard gave hog, I'd like to hear some design thoughts on Hog as a character to understand why they thought giving a tank a shotgun and hook would be a good idea
It has 200 up votes. It's not a brigade, it's people on the sub that Upvoted it and the mods getting triggered that their emperor has a negative conspiracy. The mod team should be phased out ever since the first tag of unconfirmed accusations a while back. Now ETS Brigade. What's next.

> People complain about Hanzo's scatter all the time. Putting flashbang and charge in the same category of hook is dumb and if you don't understand why it's clear you'd still be in 800 SR without Hog.\n\nBut they are instakill abilities. That was your argument was it not? That hog's hook is an instakill. So why are these abilities magically not scrutinized to the same level you do so to hogs hook? Aside from zen's discord which I'll concede was a bad example. Each requires it's own level of skill. A skillful rein can charge enemies accurately and squish them consistently, it's part of his kit. A skilled hanzo can scattershot pretty much anyone up to 300 hp or so in one shot, it's part of his kit. Same as widow, same as mcree. So why is it not fair then for a skilled hog who can aim his hook properly and punish those out of position for his instakill, something that his viability and kit depends upon whereas the others can still be extremely viable without their abilities?\n\nHis hook was fixed and balanced. Period. LOS checks fixed a lot of inconsistency and bullshit as well as distance decrease. A hook cooldown increase would have made it even more balanced alone. DVA's defense matrix being fixed helps buff her and balance team play as a whole. So where exactly do you see these massive nerfs in the PTR being justified, hog is no longer viable because a large subset of wholly unskilled people who don't understand how to kill a hog or communicate with their team whined constantly. Congratulations, you've literally forced blizzard to nerf a hero into the ground because you can't figure out how to stay behind a rein's shield or Dva and poke or focus.\n\nThere's a reason blizzard balances for the pro scene rather than casual players and that's to prevent shit like this happening. Hog was rarely chosen in the pro scene outside of situational cases because the players in mid diamond, masters, and GM and pro's are smart enough and communicate enough to know how to demolish a hog.\n

But AMD went from $2 to $12, if that's not investing I don't know what is!
1050ti is quite underwhelming compared to the 470 or even 480/1060 twins
> If anything, Hog is more effective on Oasis. \n\nHonestly, I can't remember each maps name, but there are two where he isn't as effective because the usual flanks are not wide open near the actual point. He can be more effective on higher ground on Oasis but a lot of times he is right out in the open and is demolished instantly (At least near diamond) when not grouped with your team as he should be.
> I have GTX 960 and was thinking of upgrading to something a little better. Is 1070 a good choice? It's a bit pricey, but it looks so better than 1060\n\nI have a 980ti and the 1070 is pretty much exactly the same performance that I get, but for $370 or so. Much better than your 960 and beats 1060 by around 20 or so fps
> I finished at 3.8K SR today, and I don't need high level grandmasters (which are basically the top 500 anyhow) in my games to see how busted Hog still is. LoS checks for Hook 2.0 have been a nice addition, but it obviously wasn't enough. Now it's time to actually balance Hog, after his hook has been fixed.\n\nSee this post to see what I'd like to see from blizzard in terms of hook balance https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/5vfj7v/why_does_it_seem_that_the_end_result_roadhog/de1u21z/\n\nI just don't agree with the way they are going with their "balance" right now. It's more nerf into ground and fix later which is essentially what they did with DVA for a while and I don't like that approach. They've need to stop changing big values and make incremental changes like the ones I've listed in the post. Lmk what you think, I actually want hog balanced fully, it's just that this way is not the way to get his hook balanced.
What inertia? It's not bouncing around in the back and I've done it for like 3 years with a h100i gtx and 980ti SC with no backplate and nothing has ever happened. And this is an hour trip on the highway that I do at least 12-14 times a year for breaks. \n\nUnless you're driving like a maniac you'll be fine
Fine, then I'll remove the permalinks which are obvious copy and paste spam, and the last comment. And just keep the first paragraph
I was just going to say, mechanical problems would obviously cost more than electrical or software. Why they didn't categorize them when they clearly recorded the amount of problems is beyond me
Or they could just let the AI auto use their powers like they have now but add a manual option like used in previous Mass Effects. Seems pretty dumb to remove something like that
I don't really though, only like 20k by the time I graduate next year and I'll be paying them off. Not like I'm going to immediately buy a car since I still have my Honda, but eventually soon after I graduate I will. 
I believe it was built into the LOS checks which is why as a hog main, I felt something off immediately while playing him for days after then do some testing only to realize hitboxes have changed and it's much harder to hit hooks compared to pre 2.0\n\nYou really have to lead with the hook now rather than just track otherwise it'll miss. I still wish they'd reduce the vertical hitbox a bit, it would help with people whining about getting hooked off ledges and low skill hogs not being precise with hooks
> A good Genji, Hanzo or Widow depends on their own skill and not an arguably low skill ability on a 6 second cooldown.\n\nHanzo's scattershot is arguably low skill 1hit KO to anyone not with 600 health\n\nWidow relies on aim, so does hog, you can't just hook someone without aiming and following them especially with the new checks. You also need to know to right click certain heros before hook comboing them otherwise they can escape and punish you (Mei, Reaper, Tracer, Genji, anyone with mobility). Stop being salty there are a ton of ways a hog can be punished and you instead chose to focus on my edit, ignoring all my counterarguments about hog's viability and complaints in the first place.\n\nEdit: A good tracer relies on her recall, is that also low skill to you? How about reaper and his shift ability, required for survival and outmatching/baiting people. It seems to me that anyone who can use their abilities skillfully and punish players pisses you off
> spot on\n\nAs a college student, this is why I want to finance my first "new" car (after graduating, already have a car) rather than lease. Sure. It'll be more expensive for me than leasing, but I would outright own that car and save me money in the long run when I have actual finances and living expenses a couple of years after graduating. I'd rather spend the money I earn on a car then have to switch up cars every 3 years and never own one outright. It makes no sense to me. If I have no expenses right after coming out of college and can afford to finance and still save money because I'm going to live at home. Why shouldn't I? And how is that not financially responsible?
>H100 gtx\n\nSo no, watercooling 
> Try for an 07-08 sedan though since it gets you the VQ35HR.\n\nI know this is super late but isn't the VQ35HR the same as the VQ37VHR with the exception of VVL (Variable Valve Event and Lift)?\n\nThe VQ37VHR was used from 2008-2013 so essentially any G37 would have it as well
No I mean  I'm surprised to see people talking about it in the comments, I thought no discussion at all was allowed about it
Ayyy, that's my cake day. That would be an awesome cake day gift
> Whether a brand new lambo or project car from the 60s, the support is always there :D\n\nWe're like the car version of /r/wholesomememes 
Get back to me when am official reviewer releases benchmarks officially 
> Not possible to quickly turn and just press shift, I guess?\n\nThere's LOS checks, you just got hooked because you didn't back away fast enough or were too far on the edge. If you are not in hog's LOS when he goes to hook you you wouldn't have been hooked, simple as that, learn to poke and strafe in and out of cover with hogs or stay with your team/behind a shield. Stop trying to rambo a hog 1v1
> Some will always complain that it's dumb that you can just instantly kill anyone within LoS in a 20m radius if you're skilled enough, and others are always going to respond with if you're skilled enough to do it, it's fair. There really isn't a correct argument here, because both sides have a bit of truth to them.\n\nAs someone who plays roadhog, I agree with this sentiment. Do I think good Hanzo's are op as shit? Absolutely. How do I know this? I've played with a now GM ranked Hanzo who climbed from plat. He could single handedly carry games as long as he's healed. Do I think hanzo needs a nerf? No. No hero that requires a good amount of skill should be nerfed because they are great when in the right hands, that isn't balance, that's just juggling.\n\nHere's my opinion on hog. Hog's kit is not the problem as we can see in various other games (HoTS, Paladins, League, etc.) that there are characters that use either hooks or some other mean to pull people into your team that are out of position. The problem is actually 2 fold. One, the map design up until Oasis has been horrendous, single choke point maps suffer from this the most. Looking at you Eichenwald and Hanamura :I. Hog can essentially win games on those maps consistently because he just needs one hook to delay the attackers push, not to mention the huge advantage defenders have on one choke point maps in the first place.\n\nSecondly, the required balances (note how I said balance, not nerf) that Hog needed are as follows in my mind. Hog's 2.0 patch was essential, it fixed a ton of inconsistency and bullshit, yet people still whine about getting hooked off ledges and such. If you were hooked off a ledge, sorry, you weren't fast enough or didn't poke otherwise LOS would have kicked in and canceled the hook. DVA defense matrix buff, absolutely love this because I love DVA and she is an essential counter to hog with her matrix blocking hog's combo if a team is paying attention and communicating. Good DVA counters great hogs anyday by way of her kit. Hog hook cooldown increase to 8s, love this, it can prevent a lot of hook spam in lower SR and actually force people to be more careful of their hooks instead of throwing them willy nilly hoping for a pick which at lower SR's is super easy. Also helps at higher levels for Diamond+ players to capitalize on hog's vunerability which is how he really is. Distance decrease, awesome, but a bit op, 1 shotting a zarya is not ok, they should've increased the distance to 2.5-2.75 meters. 3.5 is too much in my mind and leads to a lot of inconsistence in terms of smaller heroes (looking at you Ana/Widow and you're inhuman hitboxes).\n\nSo to clean this post up a bit.\n\n**Hog Balances that are essential to a fully balanced hook:**\n\nHook 2.0 (LOS checks)\n\nDistance increase (2.5-2.75 meters rather than 1.5m as it's too close and OP)\n\nCooldown increase slightly (8 seconds is fine imo as it eliminates unskilled hogs from doing well and rewards skilled hogs)\n\nShotgun cone decrease (Eh, haven't tested this enough to really see if it's op but I think that leaving his cone where it was before this is fine doesn't give him too much zone control)\n\n**Essential hog balances I want to see that haven't been done:**\n\nSelf heal change (either in amount healed or cooldown)\n\n>Hog heals wayy to easily and often especially on defense where you can take the time to hide behind a corner/room to heal back to full health. A decrease in healing from 300 to say 200 will make hog less tanky and easier to punish by the enemy, in turn hog players have to be more careful when they come out to hook someone and can't just run in willy nilly expecting to self heal once they fucked up and run away.\n\nSomething ult related\n\n>Lets be honest here, hog's ult is super meh, only great when combined with a zarya ult or on the rare chance you trapped some poor soul in a corner or near a ledge to push them off. Before a change is made, I'd like to see blizzards reasoning on the creation of hog's ult in the first place and what it should be used for. I've heard from some it's used for zone control and others it's for capping objectives more effectively on 2CP points.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, a look at  hog's hook distance might be in place, sometimes I'm amazed at how far it reaches, which essentially breaks some maps. Comboing that in with some of the fixes/balances I noted above and then tweaking them should give you a balanced hog.
> Yep, that is definitely life as a hog. The more I go up in rank, the more I realize that I need to stay alive by being careful.\n\nYup, I've started to play hog more like tracer than say DVA. Hog's hitbox is huge, his headshot hitbox is arguably one of the biggest in the game aside from Dva and a few others. Hog should be played as an initiator when you have a rein on your team, if you can secure a pick with hog, then you push in, if you can't or it's not working, switch off him because the other team is smart enough to know what happens when you peak out for too long in the same spot again and again. Hog at higher SR (Diamond/Masters+) should be played as run and gun. \n\nAs in, run in, do some damage, try to pull someone out of position into your team (even if it's a tank) and your team will most likely secure the kill if you can't alone (Think high health heroes or armored/shields). Then either push in and team wipe for cap or heal and try again if failed.\n\nAnother way is the spider pig tactic. Very risky, but very rewarding. Find a flank and try and get there without the other team seeing you (Think KOTH upper flanks). Wait for a bit before peeking out and hooking someone in their backline securing the kill while your team pushes their front. Congrats, you have now surrounded the enemy on both sides giving your team a huge advantage. However, with more mobile/aware heroes (Genji, Tracer, Widow, Hanzo, etc.) this can be troublesome as they generally cover a wide range of the battlefield or stay in these positions to get damage in without endangering themselves in the front line. So it's a bit limited in feasiblity depending on the enemies team comp.

My friend did it while I was only on coke and he seemed to enjoy it. As far as "cancelling out his trip" I would have to inquire with him if that happened.
I used to make smiles and once did a swastika(swear I'm not racist, just did it to look cool to some newbies.)\n\nHere's a smily I did once[Coke Smily](https://imgur.com/gallery/zDrxn) 
I was tripping on lsd with some friends one night, HARD. We were in a generally assumed to be nicer part of town with million dollar waterfront homes, ritzy downtown plaza and one of the most dense police to citizen ratio cities in the United States. This was around 1am, we finished gazing across the water at the city lights across the lake and were on our way back to our car. The sober one of us who was driving got a call from his gf. We waited by some statues and proceeded to make jokes with them and amuse ourselves.\n\nAll of a sudden we here a, "Yo!" This dude approached us dressed in his pajamas and I am not shitting you, looked exactly like carl from Workaholics but with long hair, same color too and the same beard! He proceeded to ask us why we were here to which we kinda alluded to the fact we were intoxicated but hesitated to divulge exactly what on(he probably could tell just by looking in our fucking eyes, we were LIT). The guy instantly gave off a weird vibe, asked us if we wanted to try his vape, asked if we knew where to find coke then after we told him, "no," asked if we wanted some. The whole time the sober guy is off a few feet away on the phone with his gf still not paying attention and we're trying to talk with this guy. I will never forget what happened next.\n\nThe guy nods his head after we tell him we don't want coke. THEN, proceeds to pull a pistol out and wave it around asking, "How about a gun?" I was instantly shocked, but I was forcing myself to keep cool as to not make him want to do something stupid. My other friend that was tripping had the same idea and tried to act like nothing was up. The third guy tripping though was freaking out and tried to push the gun down and ask him to, "Please, put it away." Sober guys still chatting but he is now fully aware of whats up. The guy then pulled the gun away from my friends hand and tried to show us how to use it. Said it was a combat pistol that you could quickly draw and put to someones throat(Luckily he did not try to demonstrate on one of us). The guy then started unloading shells to show it was real and bent over to pick them up. The whole time I was convinced I was getting robbed. I had my hand on my wallet ready to give it to him the second he asked. Strangely enough, at this point I had accepted the situation in my head. I was totally cool with giving him my wallet. I kept saying to myself, "This is how it goes and everyone walks away." He then reloaded the gun and asked once more, "You sure you guys don't want a gun?" We all said, "No," and he then said what I did not expect he was going to say, "Okay then, have a nice night guys." Then put the gun away and turned to walk away to which we did the exact same, but the fastest speed walk we ever did as to not freak him out or do anything suspicious. We got in our car and the sober driver threw that thing into gear, pealed out, and ran the fucking curb over screaming, "I AM A PRIVILEGED WHITE KID! I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE! WHAT THE FUCK GUYS!?" We now all laugh about the experience referring to the strange coke dealer as, "Aggressive Carl."
Xzibit would be proud.
I should have worded it a little better. The 80 holy days were just their own thing, and I know they took Sunday's off. I think traditionally, Saturday night is when you go to the tavern with your mates but I think you work a little during the day. Though, they only needed to work 50 days of the year to completely cover the cost of rent, food and general provisions. Anything else was for personal use.

From what I remember, they had a concept of how the bomb would work but when it came to actually manifesting the bomb, they were far off. England did a lot of sabotage missions to keep the Germans behind the Allies, like sabotaging the raw material manufacturing trains in Sweden among other things. At the end of the war, what the allies found was pretty behind what America had accomplished. Remember, America had minds like Einstein and Oppenheimer working on the Manhattan Project and had a lot of resources at their disposal.

The best thing I found when I got back into the game after an almost ten year hiatus was watching guys on youtube play. I'm particularly fond of the miniwargamers channel, very engaging and comprehensive with how they explain whats going on and making their games fun. I picked up a lot from doing that and playing around with some small games. I read the 7th edition book once and just got an idea of where everything was to reference it, the back has a really good index and some reference charts. Otherwise, I just memorized as I went and incorporated more and more complex aspects as I felt comfortable. Like I never did missions until recently. I'd play with objectives and what but never any of the rule book ones until recently. The big things are have fun, try new things and challenge yourself. As long as you've got someone to play with, you'll build good memories.\n\nTo give some insight on your wanting to mesh Steel Legion with the regular guard, make a "back story" like the steel legion help out or an elite detachment for your regular guard or whatever you'd like. I personally want a death corp of krieg but they're expensive! I might have to refrain myself or my wallet will hate me. To give some background, I actually play marines but my little brother has a guard army and I'll use them once in a while, mostly as an allied force to go along with my marines in bigger games but I've gotten to know them a bit and love them!\n\nTo give you some general advice, the best way to plan your army for most 40k games is figure how you're gonna score as many victory points as you can. To do that you'll need speed and "staying power." Why I recommended fast attack like the chimeras and valkyries is because they give your guys inside 2 things; extra protection and speed. If you get into scions, look at getting the militarum tempestus(totally fucked the spelling I'm sure) codex as it offers some extrapolated rules and formations for them, making them more of an elite strike force. Chimeras are one of the best transports in the game because they act like light tanks in a sense that can get some dudes around, I generally stuff veterans with special weapons which btw, if you're looking for more of those can get them on bits sites that make them independent from games workshop.\n\nThe other way to win warhammer is bring LOTS of bodies to soak the damage. Guard can do this easy. Yeah, you could get a nice armored up dude with a 3+/2+ save but eventually you might roll a 1 and then they're gone. Having multiple dudes to soak the damage is best I've found. Another thing to go along with lots of bodies is lots of shots or "dakka" as its referred to by the community. Guard can do this too very well with their tanks, hvy wpn squads among other things. These strategies are very basic and can be preformed a multitude of ways so explore at your leisure! I like sometimes playing just to see how one unit or strategy goes. The other thing about guard is most of their stuff is pretty useful in one way or another so any purchase will be a welcome addition to your force!\n\nTo answer your final questions, with hvy wpns you generally want them to be in one place most of the game. This way you can use them to their maximum potential on the field and they're not using up shots moving around. So a HWS sitting on an objective or targeting enemy tanks will most likely be a better alternative then one hvy gun in a squad moving around. If its in a squad thats going to sit on an objective for the rest of the game then that could be another scenario they might preform well. In regards to special weapons, I usually use grenadier veterans because the 4+ armor really makes a difference to the standard 5+ and kit them with something that'll counter my opponent. A few reasons why, I plan that my veterans are going to be my scoring units running around getting into the thick of things so they'll need nice counter weapons. If its a horde army with lots of light infantry, I'll bring flamers or possibly grenade launchers if they have light armor due to the GL's versatility being able to shoot a Krak and Frag grenade. If I'm up against a heavier army I might bring plasma or melta to deal with the vehicles/heavier units.\n\nBut all in all man, what make guard really shine are their tanks. They offer great fire support and are sturdy as hell. The guard have lots of cheap troop options that work really well and can be played in a few different styles. A great resource is 1d4chans tactics section, they cover EVERYTHING and the writers are funny. PM me if you need any further advice ever and good luck!

Except he fought for this country and you did not, so maybe he has a point when he says you literally don't deserve to live here.
Not a blood Angels player but a regular SM one. Def more transports, 'metal boxes' as they're referred to by the community. They keep your guys safe until they can get into position and move them around quicker. Rhino's or drop pods for the tacticals and maybe consider deep striking the terminators, I always use a teleporter if I do unless terrain is light(I fear misshaping a high point squad is why). I personally use a land raider or storm raven to get my terminators into position them being the main beat stick of my army. Space marine tanks are fairly good too but depends on who you're playing against, like I don't even try and out tank guard because they'll smoke mine. Always make sure your army is optimized to fight who ever you're facing, lots of dakka(shots) and template weapons for light armor and horde armies, high strength and low ap for heavier armies. Eldar, I usually deep strike or reserve most of my force and see what they do first then counter it. Marines can be good but usually everyone else is more specialized then we are so I follow the "know your enemy" philosophy really closely and try and bring whatever will counter who I'm playing as to have a better chance against them, great thing about marines is we can pretty much do anything to some extent. The other thing with 7th is infantry, more bodies means more guys that can still be around if you begin to take loses. Troops also get objective secured(depending on the formation) and are essential in 'winning' the battle. I always figure, "How am I going to get my tacticals on the objectives to secure them and how am I going to take out the biggest problem my enemies going to have in his list." Watch a few matches on youtube as well if you'd like to see how others play. Thats where I get a lot of my ideas from. Best of luck my friend!
I'm sure he'll be thrilled :D he whoops my butt fairly often with them.
Could post as a TIFU and this photo would be enough.
You should watch Terry Jones' Medieval Lives. Every episode is on YouTube and he covers I think 8 social groups in Medieval history and debunks myths and gives a clear picture of what it would be like to live as that type of citizen. Some stuff actually isn't half bad like for example, they consumed far more alcohol and worked a lot less then we do taking 80 days out of the year to enjoy holidays or "holy days." But it was far more corrupt and violent. I would have been a monk, they rolled in fucking money and lived fairly peaceful lives.
The snail might be immortal but I'm going to assume its not immune to pain. First, surround my place with a huge circular salt pit like a mote. Second, beyond the mote I would have several small holes filled with beer or cheap alcohol(I've heard this is a common trap some people use to protect their gardens from snails). Third, I would populate the area between my house and the salt mote with chickens(They love eating bugs).\n\nAt this point, whenever the snail would come for me, he would have to cross all these "obstacles" that would cause severe pain on him eventually rendering him immobile and unable to respond to any action taken upon him. Then, I would steal the top comments idea and trap him, or any decoy snails, in a glass jar and create a super snail prison, discover which is the immortal one then find a medium to communicate with him and ask why he wants to kill me so bad. I mean we're both immortal, we could eventually take over the planet together or end world hunger. I would find some sort of piece but I would still cover my ass. I would place a shock collar and gps locator in him so a) I always know where he is and b) rig the shock collar to zap his snail ass whenever he gets close to me. 15 or so feet should do so I can notice and tell him to knock it off. Oh and I guess c) hire someone to make sure the shock collar gets recharged regularly assuming the snail only kills me when we make contact.\n\nIf his erratic behavior continued from this point, I would eventually invest in having him launched into space with a probe headed deep into space. There's no way he'd return from that. Super unlikely worse case scenario, he some how floats super fucking slowly on the perfect trajectory to return to Earth and still has the shock collar to zap his ass.\n\nCheck mate.

I watched a neat documentary that discussed how people during the dark ages(which I would imagine carried over into the middle ages) often would see those ruins throughout Europe and know that the society before theirs was far more advanced than their own. They believed life was "better" than it was then and marveled at their technological advances and wondered why they lacked them. They often too took apart the ruins for constructing their own buildings hence why the coliseum appears the way it does. The Byzantines though who actually referred to themselves as Romans, survived well into the middle ages. They had an Emperor and even ambitions of reclaiming Rome to restore its former glory. Then you had the church which taught latin and kept extensive records and manuscripts depicting Roman society. I'm sure they knew quite a bit.
Oh that makes more sense. I just knew they used pieces of Colosseum to construct their own buildings, not really for curiosity. I know they thought it was superior to their own engineering though.
Or metal.
I love that movie!
I did not know that, thats awesome! I knew it got sacked during the first Crusade but never knew it was the downfall point.

My dad plays a Dark Eldar army and his approach is, "They're pirates and raiders. So I feel not being so uniformed looks better." He has an overall black base on most models and adds some color from their but every 5 or so he changes the color scheme and they look really cool on the table. Just a suggestion!
I mean, are you asking how to play them? Because, from what I can tell, this right here is a good small army.\n\nEdit: This is a substantial Combined Arms detachment. I would consider adding some lemmen russ' and fast attack, preferably more chimera's or a valkyrie. Where guard kick ass at is LOTS of bodies and great motorcade.
I saw it in Doors documentary on YouTube.

Similar story, opposite premise. I shaved my head once with some buddies because we thought it was funny, do something together. We all bonded over it. Every girl I tried talking to in high school after that said something along the lines of, "Oh aren't you that Nazi kid?" -_-\n\nThe fact that me and my friends were the metal heads and wore gruesome band shirts only perpetuated the myth. I had black friends though so idk why two and two didn't get put together.
I mean, you could say its a matter of opinion. IMHO I'd say the agricultural revolution. Its where civilizations history begins and for the first time we're not living as nomads, following animal herds around and settling down to build and where culture starts to flourish. Its also where all the problems begin like war, disease, government and corruption. Without that agricultural revolution we would have never gotten where we are today, regardless if its a good or bad thing.
Oh haha thats the one where they didn't even make it to the "holy land," correct?

He's a doctor, its part of his job to give you healthy advice. I'd tell him and make your decision to do his advice or continue doing what you're doing. My uncle's about to die in his early 50's from over working his heart due to his drug use and its sad. Only 12% of his heart still works and 50's not that old. Maybe space your binging out and limit what you use. I only use a gram every three weeks to a couple months. Never feel like I fiend and have normal blood pressure, same age. Just make sure you're aware of your situation then decide how you want to live your life.

Love this band and album! The End took two times to record the final cut. The first, Jim couldn't sing correctly because he showed up tripping on LSD and the music didn't sound right to any of them. They rerecorded it by candle light with Jim sober and got it perfectly.\n\nLucy makes that song into how it was meant to be listened to. SOURCE: Experience.
"Nobodies ever had the balls to treat me like that... We need balls around here. You're promoted."
Haha does that even mean bro. If anything, everyone of you Trumpets are actually mentally ill just like him because it really does take a lot to completely ignore reality. It feels good to be actually right, instead of being angry all the time like you clearly are by looking through your post history. Stay the fuck out of our politics loser, unless you voted you don't get a say.
Haha bro you've said zero definitive statements you can read back and highlight the portion where you proved something and I will instantly feel shame and apologize. Show me one thing that you PROVED, you cited or even discussed. You literally said words and clicked. Read back, seriously. Like you seem really fucking retarded right now to me and I really can't comprehend another human being doesnt understand the definition of "prove". I'll even Google it to PROVE that you didn't PROVE anything.\n\nProve - demonstrate the truth or existence of (something) by evidence or argument.\n\nSo either show me where you cited ANYTHING or admit you're an autistic waste of space that doesn't understand the definition of basic words.\n
I thought you were joking until this comment
Idgaf about your country, I care about mine. Stop using your horseshit as an example of what will happen in America. We are not pussies, you swedish fuck. Also about six months ago Trump supporters used "Swedish" as an insult to liberals claiming they only lived in Sweden. How funny is it that you're defending a movement (that you have noooo fucking reason to even BE in), where the followers literally mock you and your fellow citizens. Pretty sad honestly. Also once again your whole post is stupid, just like you.
Explain facts to support your conclusion using verifiable sourcing, no personal attacking and don't stop responding if your argument hits a road block. I haven't had a single debate with a Trumpet that was every fully discussed because it's always the same shit. Earn my respect using logic, reason and fact and I will earn yours doing the same. You know, like how conversations about everything besides politics goes. Seriously, I'm not mocking you, I'm challenging you.
Huh actually pretty sure the only poll that EVER put him at 50% was the poll ranked 27th out of 29th for accuracy. I'm gonna stick with trusting the Gallup.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports#cite_note-inside-2\n\nEdit: You can downvote the TRUTH, but that doesn't make it less true. It just means you're delusional. 
I'm ready for a civil war honestly.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
At the end of Trump's term I want to be able to google Donald Trump autopsy photos. It'll be beautiful.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Dude he's at less than fifty percent I don't know what you want.
Lol you're just a fucking retard I'm done with this, if anyone has any doubts about this person's intelligence, go and check out their account. It's filled with biased and genuinely out of place dumb shit, and not one single fact. It's hilarious these people think they're smart. Have fun getting raped by Muslims in Sweden, have fun never seeing American soil loser.
If anything the pizza hut guy assaulted OP
Bro I'm happy as FUCK right now. You should have seen my smile the day Flynn resigned. I'm so happy you guys are exposing yourself, Im so happy we get to fight and win. Let me know when you got some sources and facts little boy, I'll be right here being smarter than you.
Delusional- characterized by or holding idiosyncratic beliefs or impressions that are contradicted by reality or rational argument, typically as a symptom of mental disorder.\n\nJust kill yourself so you can meet the god that doesn't exist. You must be so fucking stupid to bring up a fairytale in a real world political conversation. Kill. Yourself.
Lol what do you even think a fascist is
I think it'll be a common trend in lower educated areas, but we'll see. I don't really care about conservatives, but this is about more than that right now. I'm never going to be scared of standing up for the frightened while a rich man in a suit tells them they are bad people, no matter the circumstances.
You're getting down voted and I know you're making a joke, regardless of all that I would die under your leadership.
I would expect a world famous athlete to have better colored bananas.
When exactly did you prove me wrong???? Are you completely delusional or just a bit (pretending you served thing).
Thanks for confirming your autism, I'm proud of you for typing words
That's the problem with you people, you think things like "not an argument, just stating a fact" about an opinion makes it a reality. You are not the kid in the twilight zone, the world does not revolve around your every thought and I'm sorry to have to break your bubble. Opinion still doesn't equal fact no matter how so very bad you want it to. SAD.
See I don't understand that. You're saying it's our only chance, but if the millennials use the momentum we have right now to take back our government, none of that shit will matter to anyone but historians. We should use our power (which we do have) into changing the system not figuring out exactly where and why it went bad (though it is very important none the less). We shouldn't embrace the separation because it only hurts us. \n\nAmerica was told to pick between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Wouldnt it be amazing to tell your grandchildren that you never accepted either? Redesign the system, remove current politicians and end citizens united. Make a universal basic income funded by AI for every citizen and make healthcare and education free. Then and only then can you tell your children that the world truly belongs to them for the next hundred years.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Lol why are you so scared bro? You think people are going to take your shit, rape your friends?!?! Are you literally insane bro? Nothing is going to happen and if you are so scared, go buy one of those guns everyone gets to carry around. I just don't get why you are such a pussy when we've been taking refugees by the thousands, our system has been proven to work and absolutely nothing has happened here because we have so many people with guns. Even the people below me pointed out this entire post in this context is literally obsolete and stupid. Why are you trying so hard to justify hating people you don't know?
Uhhh yep. They get to point at Trump and say SEE they elected this racist piece of shit. They really are the enemies, come fight for us. You're all so retarded it's monumental.
Egotistical is a big word for you? All I asked for the definition of racism. There is literally nothing from the poster with that info. Maybe stop classifying people into preconceived categories and you won't have the overwhelming desire to blow your brains out all the time.
I'm literally talking to you. You. Do. Not. Deserve. To. Exist. Kill. Yourself. Loser. Nobody cares about you, you offer nothing to the world. You bring hate so you deserve death.
"Delusional", "The only people Donald Trump says are bad people are BAD people"- checks reality\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\n\nHuh turns out you're full of shit, maybe you're the ACTUAL delusional one. This case he took out adspace trying to get support for legally lynching black kids who hadn't actually committed any crime. Trump was under no obligation to do this, he felt he had to. What kind of fucking person even does that? Sorry but you really are delusional as fuck and I feel bad for you. Lemme guess, fake news? He fucking did television interviews about it.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Why do you really care bro how does anything an individual does even affect you?
Lol except in two years more conservatives will be dead and more millennials will be 18+, it all mathematically adds up to us crushing the senate.
Hahaha tell me what FFL stands for.
Yeah I live in NH and this guy is now a hero here.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahabahahahahaha
Meh I more or less tokenized you anyways, just like the rest of America. That's the thing about freedom of speech. Also I want to put an asterisk saying if you fought in Iraq or Afghanistan than I don't respect you at all because you let yourself be used as a tool.
Right? I fucking love corn.
Eh turns out you're right and I hate to admit it but that's the truth. At the same time, this person can already get into our country and he isn't banned and will never be banned. Isn't that case enough to prove that straight up banning people from entering is counter productive to evolving society further? America literally couldn't exist without immigration, and I don't understand being scared of them. \n\nI'm not any more afraid of a Muslim fascist than I am a conservative Christian bishop or a Nazi skinhead. I think these are individual cases and can be taken care of on a case by case basis by a well funded police and informed, intelligent and empathetic  citizens. I think we're too strong and too brave to say that we are scared because most of us really really really aren't. Sorry I repeatedly said to kill yourself I've been more emotional than I like to br when it comes to politics.
Cause it's fucking hilarious to do in my spare time. I can spout this shit like it's nothing but to you people it's so fucking devestating because you get SO MAD and it's ironic since the president literally started as a meme. I am rather frustrated with the political world, and it's fun to send abuse your way. Basically I like making stupid people mad.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Ty bruh
Oh wait thats right you don't know the definition of racism and you're too egotistical to google it.
Because it's their fucking right. You don't think I cringe every time I see a "God Hates Fags" poster, or when I see moron politicians use a fairy tale to justify real world things. It makes me sick to see what we do with religion as justification but since we do, you have absolutely zero right to bitch about anyone elses. As long as the scary man on fire living in the center of the earth is viable reason for abortion to be made illegal, you have no right judging others.\n\nBasically you don't get to call that religion stupid until America calls its own religion stupid. If you're going to be smart you don't get to be hypocritical because then you are stupid.
But the president said CNN was fake news so your source is invalid. So I suggest you go back and read my post again.
Lol you have NO idea who I am, but I'm not arguing with you.
Lol no you didn't you let them die horribly. Sorry BITCH you don't just GET respect. Go fix the polar ice caps, go plant some fucking trees and then kill yourself. That's the only way to redeem your piece of TRASH generation 
You should probably hate all old American men you see in Thailand and handle with extreme prejudice.
There's gotta be a heron marked blade somewhere right?
Haha you think we don't have guns too? Remember the last civil war? You people are WRROROOONNNNGGGG and you will LLOOSSSEEEEE. At least we have the Intelligence Community on our side, which will probably make really quick work of your little revolution. Hope to see you in battle you no brained BITCH.
Just like you would get killed living in a ghetto your whole life, and I already survived that. I've had to fight my whole life except it was just to stay alive. It'll be the "safe space" upper middle class entitled Trump supporters that will fall in droves. It's gonna be a beautiful thing folks, it really is.
Treason- The crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.\n\nMcCain has done none of that. If anything, he's representing the will of the majority. That's really his job, is to cater to the most common denominator (something Trump hasn't done since the inauguration). Why is r/conspiracy now a pool of garbage with biased articles and far right tendencies? The nature of this sub was NEVER political and was meant for pure unbiased fact and speculation. Back when pzagate was banned, it was implied that it was only right wingers involved, which is NOT true. \n\nRemember when we fought with takedowns and blackouts for a full 48 hours together to make Paul Combetta a household name? I did that as a liberal and so did sooo many. Idk what happened to this sub, but THIS is trash.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Except the world has changed and now things that hurt people across the world hurt people everywhere because we are more connected than was ever possible. A trend for years has been to insult the boomers for all the damage they have done to the world and made it pretty shitty for those of us that don't have resources to take care of ourselves. I could go into more details but I think you get it, and I don't want to be rude. Millennials are deeply hurt by the world you've left for us and we resent you, and with it goes civility. 
K "thx for your service" baby killer, enjoy my tax dollars. You're welcome.
Haha pretty sure I've had friends since kindergarten put bullets in their brains for things they've done, so keep pissing on their graves please. 
Lol k obvious stolen valor is obvious. Get a life loser.
Not legally. So since God doesn't exist (or at least won't show up at court), I guess it isn't...
See you're not leaving room for discussion , you're attacking me for doing things I literally never did. You're making some imaginary person in your mind called "liberal", and classifying me. This is a sign on mental illness, not intelligence. You assumed I've given money to Jill stein and Sanders, I personally haven't but OK if you say so. \n\nI understand ALL people are at different levels of intellectuality and to fully debate you need to gauge how evolved your opponent is as far as worldly understanding and core wisdom. Trump supporters tend to do what you just did; respond to a person's well though out sentiment with random attacks that don't even correlate with what they even originally said, because EVERYTHING NEEDS to fit the narrative you've put into your own heads.\n\nIf you don't want to think, learn or do research that's fine and your choice to make. If that's your decision on how to live your life, at least consider your blatant lack of knowledge hurts the rest of the world too, and you add negatively to the world.
Nah we need another plague to wipe out all the weak boomers honestly. You guys are cancerous and need to let go and quit being life hogs. Your opinions are wrong and you have no right to share them. Gtfo the internet you pussy, go back to your safe space gwampa.
Lol so maybe stay the fuck out of American politics you fucking loser?! You literally have zero right to even talk, stfu bro.
Nothing, Im just amazed you can equate a journalist defending pedophilia and an entire religion of people. Are you suggesting we holocaust them? No you're not, you're not saying anything except making a negative comment about a religion you tokenized to suit your own political agenda. It's the lowest level of low, and I find it hilarious you don't recognize that and aren't capable of examining yourself. That's why I spit out my coffee. 
The failures of the Democratic party are the ONLY reasons he is in office, NEVER forget that for a SECOND.
What you get for being easily predictable and largely autistic. You people need to die honestly.
Why
Lol just kill yourself bro. Nobody gives a shit about you and you say fucked up shit like this, so just die. Nobody needs you on this planet.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
I live on the Olympic peninsula and am moving to Olympia. Ever since I was a kid I think its one of those things that's always in the back of everyone's mind.
Even if I trusted any of your sources, I think I actually believe you. This election was the most horseshit election in all of our lifetimes and I fully understand not wanting to choose the lesser of two evils. Conservatives continue to die, millennials continue to turn 18 and vote liberal. Trump has had a year of scandals in a month, let's see how motivated for change America is in 2018 and 2020. I doubt Trump will last that long though.
Lol I guess saying the most unpopular president in history passing one of the most unpopular bills in history is somehow irrelevant?
Meh well turns out it was unconstitutional the whole time, so what exactly does that make Donald Trump. It's important to note Obama never actually placed the ban, because he's smart and knew what it would mean and what would happen.
At least we learned today that rightists will indeed stoop to defending pedos if it could further their political agendas. Sick fucks.
I think he's telling you that none of that has anything to do with Milo defending pedos.
Go back to your safe space cuntbag
But you're not or you wouldn't be speaking in hypothetical terms. I only hate dumb people who go out of their ways to be douchebags. You see I grew up in the ghetto where you have to fight to stay alive and it's all I've known. I'm not a little pussy like you who's afraid of the "scary Muslims", because I'm a man. I don't see strangers and think I should deprive them of opportunity for a better life. You wanna get your shit together, and actually become a citizen? AWESOME!I'll stand up for you too, and protect you and give my life for YOU. But at the same time if you try to hurt or intimidate or threaten anyone near me I will stand up to you, regardless of race, size or situation. You see, most of us "snowflakes" are liberals because we grew up poor and actually suffered and became stronger because of it. Honestly I feel bad for you, because you are obviously not a man. \n\nAnd you can keep your pussy musings in Sweden where it belongs.
You are so fucking stupid I spit out my coffee.
So maybe just take it by a person to person basis, accept some people are just awful, identify that you don't like that behavior and that it's unacceptable and respond appropriately. We don't need to blanket discriminate because we are stronger as a people.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
I'm pretty sure about 50% of the shit I've seen since I was 3 has been veiled propoganda 
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
"The only people Trump has ever said are bad people, are bad people. Stop listening to what others say about him, and actually listen to him." -You Right Now\n\n\nThen I showed you a time that Trump said some people were bad and wanted them to die who were actually innocent. You now reject that you said what is proven just one text block above. You people really are something.\n\nDelusional- "characterized by or holding idiosyncratic beliefs or impressions that are contradicted by reality or rational argument, typically as a symptom of mental disorder."
Thanks for confirming your autism, I'm proud of you for typing words\n\n

Guess no terrorists come from Saudi Arabia. Nice to see a fat old man suck some more of that big oil cock. Trump is literally deepthroating the oil industry, brutally gagging him a with their dicks in his mouth.
I would 100% switch with you because at least my life might have a purpose besides how efficiently I produce. America turns you hollow. Ive honestly considered joining the FFL to fight ISIS but not sure if I would be shipped out where I want to be.b
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Well let's see given Trump's record setting approval rating and smooth transition has given you much to hope for. 
Haha you angry shit, too bad that's what healthcare is for. How about they pay for their own abortions if Republicans agree to pay for their on cancer and emphysema treatments (since you're all old as fuck as it is).
Hahah too bad debt traps, shitty jobs and college loans exist. It also sucks 80% of my income goes to rent bills and food. Can you just kill yourself bro? Seriously I'm not trying to be mean but where's the room for growth from that comment? Just leave? We can't, because of how shitty our country treats us. If you don't want to learn FACTS and UNDERSTAND and contribute to the world in a positive way and instead choose to spread hate because you're too dumb to learn, what exactly is the reason for you to not kill yourself?\n\nTaking god out of the equation for obvious reasons, all you do is make the world worse by existing. You can just go inform yourself, but that's just too much work, so you spread mindless hate. Why do you deserve to live? What purpose do you serve? Do you feed starving children? Do you offer aid to the poor? It seems you people DO nothing, LEARN nothing and spread mindless hate. If Trump gets impeached will you kill yourself? Basically what I'm saying is what do I have to say to get you to kill yourself TODAY?
Well there's the next tier thinkers and than the ones that aren't capable of any tier but the first. I believe most Trump supporters are generally in the latter. I wrote my first post meant to insult and hurt Trump supporters because I hate you all sincerely and wish you didn't exist. Than the first commenter offered an intellectual challenge; I accepted and set terms, but nobody even posted one fact, as per usual. Go and scan every response I've gotten and look for ONE fact. There are none, as is typical with you people.\n\nSo as of now I'm assuming you have rejected the notion of a reasonable debate so once again I shred any hint of caring. You can all gag on my balls and go cry in your safe spaces when we rip your hero out of the white house and lock him up, courtesy of the bros in the FBI/NSA/CIA whom Trump has repeatedly fucked with. Here's hoping you get to tell your children you supported a man who will die in jail BIIIIIIITTTTTCCCCHHH. \n\nPS I'm glad when the union won the civil war, we didn't do shit to clean up the southern states that got fucked up by the Confederacies bullshit. I'm so happy when I read about how much those people suffered for wanting to fight for the freedom to own human beings. I'm glad your cities went to shit and the hardcore ferocity of capitalism turned your shit side of the nation's to the downside. I'm glad you, and your kids and your kids kids will have to choose between working in an oil rig or being a meth dealer. You deserve everything you've gotten, and everything that will come. Maybe just kill yourself?
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Read the username bro, everything's a lie on the internet, satanism for eternity
Hahaha thanks for taking the bait asshole. My point was more people actually give a shit or else all these movements wouldn't exist. You just took a shit in the middle of a liberal country because of a multitude of factors, but 100% NOT because your candidate has any real substance or admirable qualities. It's fine though. We'll keep protesting until it goes away, and the intelligence agencies will clean up your big shit because that's why they have jobs. Nobody protested obama besides weird Alabama racist white people, because most people are actually capable of understanding reality. \n\nTrump is a monkey with a cigar who is really just sort of bumbling through life, and basically trying to have a good time. That's why he threw a fucking rally after he took office, because that's all he really cares about. He doesn't want criticism he wants fun. Since he's president you'd expect everyone would just quit their bitching right???\n\nNever ever going to happen, we're in it for the long haul. See you 2018. -Overwhelmingly Majority of Millenials
Nobody gives a fuck dude. So what you suffered and your parents suffer, are you really dark enough to say we should suffer like you did because we deserve it? Yeah no, we have much better ideas for the world and honestly if I could press a button instantly killing all of you I really would. Just fucking die LIFE HOGS. Nobody cares about your suffering, they want to avoid suffering period. If you're at ALL proud of anything politically since 1963 then fucking execute your family and go meet the god you spend your life worshiping that doesn't actually exist. SAD.
Hahaha what makes you think that retard? Pretty sure you're just making random assumptions because youre a miserable fuck. Make sure you suck some oil cock on the way out of this conversation bro. Also protests will keep happening, keep crying in your safe space you little pussy.
Sounds like someone's a little boy diddler.
Meh still a good chance he's fucked himself too hard to even get one thing done. Citizens will protest ANYTHING he does at this point. Only repaying you guys for Obama amirite? If anyone will get this done it'll be pence not Trump, since we all know Republicans are just using him to pass the legislation they want. This will be hilarious in the end. Anyways I'm gonna sleep, see you at the "not my president" day protest! 
Bro that's the dumbest thing you've said and I'm really not trying to be mean. I understand they are culturally different but we have plenty of police officers that we pay to keep us safe, in addition to the FBI, CIA, NSA, etc. Ive seen zero verifiable evidence of widespread rape and murder in Sweden and keep hearing about it in the form of opinion. I'm sorry but the evidence just isn't there. \n\nAnd for the record, Christianity has literally killed millions throughout history.
The terminus one is still the most brutal to me. At least with Megan most people knew what was coming.
I play against many level 9s and even occasional 8s. If you got there once you can do it again.
Why would you want a f*ck you emote, obviously showing that they got to you, only to have them laugh at you. Then how pissed will you be?
Do you? 
Ya, I asked one of these people why there are different constellations for the hemispheres or why I can't see them from here or the tallest mountain. They said it's too far away on land. Guess the stars distance don't matter.
Given that you want to call me a nerd yet you post to buildapc how bout you tell me why I'm wrong instead of attacking me personally, or is my one word answer so good that you don't have shit.
I wanted to see him as ron Paul's VP. I dont know how much their politics line up but their morals seem too. Across the aisle for the highest seat, yes please.
I could see that but I really think either Sanaa will eliminate little finger. And if not any tension between her and Jon will go away either with the wall coming down or white walkers appearing or both
Ha, you've made enough references to Opie and Anthony that you are as much of a fan of it as I am, which ain't much. I'm also blown away that you can make bad/good nerd comments but call me smug. \n\nBut whatever, I would have preferred a civil discourse about my original comment but I guess that's not possible. You absolutely should learn something about yourself from the way you've been responding and make some adjustments. I wish you the best of luck.
Are you East or west? Hope that wall comes down soon.
Oh good. You managed to be both condescending and taking it to its most extreme maliciousness as well. Bravo.
Now he can blow his nose and wipe his ass at the same time
My home course has a couple people that used to play with him and weese. They can't stand them so they get upset when I talk about him. I feel like he should be top three in the world but he's holding himself back. He is tough on himself but I never see him turn that around on other people.
From what I've seen I wouldn't blame him for putting him in that group. He throws tantrums too when he screws up. He says cold hearted stuff about his competitors. Hes really reluctant to congratulate other people for winning. Only difference is he's quieter about it.
I agree that here and there David Icke will get something right, but he's still a lunatic that throws out crazy ideas. And that commenter didn't assert a nut brain idea, they don't have to prove shit, it doesn't work like that.
They hate us for our freedom!
Lot of people bitching in here, when all they have to do is ignore the content they don't like. Not only do they want to control the content they see but they want to control the content others see. I'm seeing people say Eddie caused certain content. As far as I see he brings in conspiracy stuff that people seem to think doesn't belong. Meanwhile, people forget Joe questioned Neil degrades Tyson about us landing on the fucking moon! \n\nThere used to be a place for people to post shit this sub didn't like, it was called r/rogan2, and you guys bitched about that one so much it went away. With the existence of that sub the mods could have cleaned this one up much easier, since there was a place for others to post. Now you're reaping the rewards of your bitching cocksuckahs.
How are you not dead yet?
Wow congrats! Got a specific diet you're doing?
If you shot the end of a log it's going to penetrate better than shooting the side.
I've been running zap, collector, barbs, witch, fireball, musk, rage, 3 musk and damned if it isn't fun as hell.
Ya sometimes the podcast seems like it should have been an unrecorded lunch between friends
Oh don't worry I'm doing those things too. In the meantime why don't you tell me why I'm wrong about the state of Venezuela though? I honestly want to know because I'm not finding anything good. \n\nOh I like disc golf and Futurama too, in case you wanna make fun of those too. I'll try to think of more.
That 5 seconds starting at 2:32 is still the funniest thing to me from any movie. His crazy face and the sound he makes, gets me every time.
This kind of a testament to patience more than anything.
Here's an idea...Don't read it if you don't like it. Or...Gasp...Don't fucking react to it if you don't like the comment. Then you've got nothing to bitch about. Or do you just like to bitch?
Wow you are astronomically wrong with this statement.
I'll never understand this. If you don't like it, don't watch it. If you don't want your kids to watch it, be a parent. But to say you don't want to watch it so nobody should, fuck you.
Sooo how are you interpreting that as obnoxious to other people? Are you one of those sensitive types?

These make the worst kind of podcasts to me. Why have someone on if you don't care what they say? Crowder said LA is a bubble, which Joe has said plenty of times, and he shit on Crowder for saying it.

See fuck man, if this was the topic of discussion we would be laughing at the same exact shit. I would've written that exact response regarding the show.

Women's rights protesters hold up signs advocating to rape her. I can't blame the price tag for securing her safety. 
It's the whole reason the media is so intent on keeping us divided. Everything that is going on requires you to pick a side, and those sides always reduce to two teams only. As long as we're divided we will never focus on the machine that is grinding away.
So that's a yes then. No one on Nikko's card told him to keep it down. No one told the gallery anywhere on this course to keep it down. No one told the other players on Rick's card to keep it down when they were talking about it while on he was on the pad. If you don't like Nikko that's fine but have fun being a fucking killjoy.

There's so much I want to say about this asshole teacher but I feel I can sum it up by noticing that he has pink pants on.
You don't actually think he believes that right? The dude is in the business of conspiracies (and shilling his products). If he only talked about the same four things he would have to change his show to "the Alex Jones experience."

Sorry this person can't understand. I wish people would stop focusing on what everyone makes per hour and instead look in to where the buying power of the dollar has gone.
Ya man I'm the same way. I have day to day frustrations and I take it out on the internet at times. But outside of it I have friends of all walks. Shit, at my job I wouldn't last if I couldn't handle that. And I agree on game of thrones, and the writing is shit on walking dead but I've been in to zombies since I was kid, I'm naturally drawn to it.\n\nLook, I would have elaborated on the Venezuela thing, but I'm at work, I can't chase sources, and its a pain on my phone.

Hi! A shill is literally someone who is being paid to do things. I really doubt anyone posting here is a paid shill. I just don't see it being grounded in reality. Share Blue and Cambridge Analytica Dont work the way I think you think they work. 
What?!
You banned yet? 
Doxxing to the max on this one! Ban.
I've seen the artwork and the teenagers aren't naked you dolt. A simple google search of the artist reveals nothing nefarious. More reaching evidence....yawn. 
Next time could even be worse! This shit is seriously crazy.
A lot of these idiots are calling for civil war if Trump gets impeached. Glad the NSA is likely keeping an eye on them. 
Nobody ordered a coup. Watch the documentary 'Winter on Fire' on Netflix. It's a fantastic look at what went down and why the people rejected Russian influence. Learn something instead of mindlessly gobbling up alt-right sound bytes. 
You strike me as a person who thinks they are smarter than everyone else, when in reality, you are quite dull and somewhat pretentious. 
Ever heard of Cambridge Analytica?
The only thing I liked about Hillary: she appeared to genuinely be interested in making UFO disclosure a thing. Bill says he tried to find out but whoever had the answers blocked him at every attempt. 
It's lights from ships on the horizon, possibly cruise ships.
Can anyone see this comment? 
Not at all. I just think pizzagaters are idiots that need to be shut down. Enjoy the downvote! 😙
It's still a really good documentary. Will you watch it and tell me what you thought when you finish? 
An incoming administration undermining a presidential order in collusion with a foreign government is treason under the Logan act. That is not fake news, it's a fact. 
What if the plan all along had been to make Pence president? I could totally see the Donald not actually wanting to do the job. Maybe he's doing so much crazy shit right away to purposely get impeached. Give the assist for Pence as it were. 
Or banned for obscure reasons...

Why don't you do some research and get back to us on wether any of your 'evidence' would be good enough for a judge to issue a warrant.
You're basically saying Ukraine should just let Russia take a third of the country. Fucking ridiculous! Who would do that? And in the regions that want secession, there are also the other half of the residents who are ethinically Russian but hate Russia for its atrocities against them or someone they know. Should all the people that support the Ukrainian government in Donetsk just move? 
I'm sure he got the 'UFO's for dummies' briefing every incoming president gets. Although it's the extremely filtered version. 
Test.
Nice propaganda comrade! Stalin would be proud! 
The mods literally stickies a thread about banning people for accusing each other of being shills. Cut the toxic name calling. That's all this sub had become and it's a tired trope. We are real fucking people, not bots, not paid by any outside party for providing our own thoughts here. So chill the fudge out.
Advocates torture and believes in Pizzagate. A good random sample of Trump voter mentality. 
Because I've always been into conspiracy theories. I just think some hold more water than others. 
No, it really isn't. It's all in your heads. The way I see it is this, everything in those emails is taken way out of context and the "evidence" is really reaching. You are literally destroying someone's well-being and businesses by perpetuating a popular myth that has no evidence that would ever receive even a search warrant in court. One guy already went in there with an AR-15. What's it going to take for you people to realize how nuts you all sound? Someone to go shoot up the place only to find there is nothing nefarious?! \n\nI truly believe it's a psyop related to everyone's other favorite conspiracy: UFO's. Now hear me out, the topic of unidentified ariel phenomena has been taken seriously by the intelligence and military sectors for many years. The subject happens to be the most classified subject with a clearance above 'Q'. \n\nPodesta has always been a believer and huge advocate for UFO disclosure. Bill and Hillary, also have had an interest in the subject. Both have expressed a desire to get to the bottom of it and bring transparency to American people on the issue. Obama and Bush laughed the subject off (they most likely decided to play ball with TPTB). \n\nI don't believe the American people pick their president. I think it's a pre-determined decision, and in this case, Trump seemed the best anti-disclosure candidate. Thus, a coordinated psy-op was created, to turn the conspiracy crowd (according to some polls that's 45% of the nation) against them and to help disseminate fake news. That's my two cents and I'm no shill. 
Have people talked about this already?
California wants to secede from the Union. Should we just let them? 
It's Yuuuuuuuuuge! The yugest. Big league!
These pizzagaters are getting out of hand. Time to start alerting the authorities. 
I actually had the epiphany that 9-11 might be an inside job while watching the Oliver Stone film 'JFK' back in 04. After the movie I got on the internet and started researching. What I found blew my mind. 
You're an idiot. Quit talking about shit you have no clue or real-life experience with. In my job I meet almost a hundred people a day. Whenever I meet a Ukrainian I ask them what they think of Russia, and it's always the same answer. The majority of the country is pro-west, anti-Russia. The majority of the people supported getting rid of Yanukoyvich. 
Rumor has it Assange has the only known copy of Half-Life 3. 
That's fucking bullshit and you know it. You ban anyone that criticizes Trump. You've alienated your user base and replaced it with T_D cucks. Have fun in your new echo chamber.  Watch the mods censor this post and ban me. \n\nr/conspiracy: brought to you by Cambridge Analytica. 
Agreed. 
Can we all stop calling each other "shills" please. It's the new shitstain phrase and it's annoying as fuck. This is a forum for open discourse not name calling. Be better than that. 
They are also banning many accounts critical of Trump. I've talked to countless people on here since the election season started who've been banned for no other reason than that. 
"Beep, boop, beep, boob" ^

they're also cucks who let their women get raped by refugees.
r/worldnews is cancer fuel. Everything is Anti-trump and then they bitch that r/the_donald is anti-them.\n\nits hilarious to watch. I've been banned from both, but i still hit up the donald.
go back to r/cucks
yup, did keto for 8 months. i felt great, but i couldn't work out cuz i love High intensity workouts. I lost tons of weight, but gained back my depression that i alleviated with workouts. Now i do the starch solution and am losing weight, have tons of energy and can work out as much as i want.
I downloaded a bunch of porn and then had a reason to break up with my GF of 4 years.
there's no censorship, you can start your own sub anytime bud.

you guys have absolutely no idea what you are doing to the reddit community and thats the best part.

its was a waste of time and crap still flowed in.
don't worry fam.\n\n1. This is going to blow up in their faces\n2. Reddit doesn't matter in the grand scheme\n3. They're successfully decentralizing the Right (this is good)\n4. People will Get Sick of them Throwing politics into Everything.\n\nWe've already won and they can't stop us.
Ah yes I was actually bummed it went down. Some grade A trolling in the last one 
4chan is right though, no one is gonna give two shits, they're pushing the pizzagate onto other people now.

Never thought i would see this here. i got interested in 432hz and decided to do my own experiments after watching some youtube video's about it. \n\nI downloaded gstrings from google play which lets you set a custom hz.\n\nSince i sang songs on my acoustic at normal 440hz it took a while for me to sing "in Tune" with the lower hertz. it took about a week for that.\n\nI stuck with 432hz for about a month and found out that\n\n1. my guitar stays in tune longer during playtime\n2. my guitar gets Less out of tune after i let it sit for a couple of days\n3. I can sing longer and don't get any horse voice.\n4. When i play it sounded "dull" at first, but it "resonates" more.\n5. Singing  is a lot easier. I thought i was because i dropped tuning, but that's not it.\n\nif you have an acoustic guitar you should try it out for more than a day. it takes time for your ears to attenuate. \n\nThe only downside is that i couldn't get other musicians (bass player, drummer) to change their tuning because they both thought 432hz was old music bullshit.\n\nwhen i play with other musicians i play standard on my electric, but my acoustic stays at 432hz. 
lmao, you've most likely been banned or shadow banned or whatever new system they have in place.\n\nI was banned by the_donald during the beginning of pizza gate. they're afraid of it getting used to close them down. \n\nI told them to fuck off and to stay safe. \n\npretty sure the_donald is gonna get shut down soon anyways, once reddit closed r/alt-right they all went over to the_donald and are pushing the race thing right now.\n\nyou'll notice all the "dear white people" threads and the "fuck white people" threads popping up.\n

The code is that they are calling for the opposite of what we usually term "working for humanity".

The term "fake news" started to be planted in the mainstream media months before wikileaks red pilled millions.

Look how it was able to crush the momentum of the trending of pizzagate. \n\nThe pedo cabal is real, and everyone in this sub doubting it is falling for the psyop *hard*\n\nFor anyone who is unsure about pizzagate, check out this thesis (free book) I wrote and released in 2014, long before pizzagate, with over 100 pages dedicated to the pedo cabal, child abuse and mind control.\n\nhttp://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil\n\nFake news has worked tremendously and will continue to be used for more damaging leaks in the future.\n

They used controlled disclosure to reveal just enough about the surveillance state to increase fear yet not enough to create a movement for change. \n\nNow it is just another piece of information that people don't think critically about. \n\nThe same thing will happen with future tech disclosure. It will be controlled so enough is revealed to keep humanity hypnotized but not enough that would overthrow the power structures (i.e. free energy)
wanttoknow.info has a lot of primary documents on MK ULTRA received through the FOIA.\n\nhttp://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse
Not the same as a child abuse ring like they run in D.C. though.  It sounds like they re just busting average Johns

I just foound this cool document, not sure if you have seen it.\n\nWith Uri Geller\n\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000100480003-3.pdf\n\nand a Stanford Research Institute briefing claiming that they had a video of Geller bending spoons with just a tap\n\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00787R000400070029-2.pdf
The significance of the story is how far removed from reality the attacks by the media were on pewdiepie. Millions of his followers just had their trust in mainstream media slashed, which is a good thing.
We are living in an illusion for the purpose of developing our consciousness. 99.999999% of the atom is space, right? There is a control system in place that is evil. Our job is to wake up to the control system, wake up to the divine nature of reality, and seize our right to control our own reality.\n\nOP have you read the Law of One, the Ra Material?\n\nhttp://www.lawofone.info/
I wrote a book about psychopathy and and power in 2014. Over 100 pages are dedicated to the pedocabal\n\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/28a68f3405.pdf\n\nIt's got almost 30,000 downloads now, check it out\n\nits free
Interesting, thanks for bringing this to my attention. A mass raid violating the rights of a sanctuary city would be quite the psyop to further divide the country 
I agree completely. The hermetic saying "as above, so below" applies here. Psychopathy is the psychological manifestation of spiritual/energetic events/structures/relationships.
You are welcome! These are the exact links that worked for me.
People dismiss it as an art piece, but those screams are real.
I think they are connected, but it goes way beyond Pizzagate, so I am trying out new titles to see what works.\n\nThe term Pizzagate has been poisoned. 
Maher is a pedophile
I'm open to the idea but can I hear your argument? I'm one degree of separation from the man and I hear good things, especially with the concept of open source intelligence.

Wow that is some good insight.\n\nIts like the parent asking the child, "do you want peas or carrots for your vegetables" instead of asking "do you want vegetables". 
I've read that we are perfect and complete, and yet also constantly "in a state of becoming". That we are complete but also experience the development of completeness to fully understand it. it resonates with me but not 100%. \n\nWhat do you think is the purpose of this experience then?
Secondary psychopathy is also a thing. Researchers describe it as psychopathic tendencies that are acquired through environmental factors. So even if they are not born with it, their lust for power/money molds their minds until the traits manifest.
Thanks for sharing. I believe the possibility something is up. This type of thing is not unheard of
Thank you!
of course. just dont confuse perceived authority of major institutions with real unbiased factual reporting.

Thank you :) I worked in the autism community, in a school and privately, until October of last year when I moved to Peru with my wife. \n\nI had some powerful life changing experiences during that time. \n\nThanks for the information on the Inuit. It fits right in, a very interesting anecdote.

Great post. The history of child abuse rings protected by the State have a large history.\n\nI am the original author of the post \n\n> [ORIGINAL RESEARCH] The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies\n\nand in 2014 I expanded the thesis to over 100 pages\n\nhttp://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil\n\nI think that this common sense argument presented in OPs link plus a rational look at the wide history of protected child abuse rings can bring many many people to their senses on the subject.\n\nKeep spreading this info far and wide, everyone. The more the people are aware, the closer we can get to saving these kids.
When we recognize that we are surrounded by darkness, we then realize we have the choice to become the light. How powerful is one candle in a dark room? Pretty powerful. What about a million candles?
Can you give me some more sources on the CIA and psychics? I read the Jupiter probing doc and loved it. Any more docs or secondary/teriary sources would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, I would think that a majority of the ESP use would be offensive instead of defensive.
I agree, the elite believe that Iran has to go. I imagine that there will be a large uptick in terrorism and the deep state will link it to the support of Iran's intelligence services. Israel might be the victim of attacks too and take the first strike. \n\n
makes sense
exactly, so they are forced to use psychological tricks to get people to come to hard conclusions without doing any research. To get peoples brains to block any motivation to research the information for themselves.
I disagree completely, evolution is constantly evolving and humanity is one link on the chain\n\nedit: misunderstood. So why is that a flaw for the theory?

This is one of the biggest questions, really.

there are lots of types of fake news. there are sites that post sensationalist bullsht for ad revenue, there are mainstream outlets misreporting the facts or publishing propaganda to deliberately misinform, and there are CIA disinfo operations such as the recent cnn porn report undertaken to marginalize alternative news sources.\n\nwe're not saying that the first category doesnt exist... the argument is that it is having a spotlight shined on it and being overblown for an agenda that benefits the second two.

thanks for the permaculture shoutout. My wife and I are about a year away from launching sustainable communities in the andes and the amazon jungle. everyone's invited, stay tuned.
The term "fake news" has been planted in our subconscious for a few months now, with lots of MSM October articles mentioning it briefly.\n\nThe pedo code was noticed over a month ago, at least by October 28th.\n\nWhen Pizzagate hit critical mass and went beyond forums into news sources, at the very same time "Fake News" starting being pushed like crazy.\n\nIt is not a coincidence. "Fake news" was being prepped as a way to deal with any of the wikileaks being big. \n\nAnd its working. Google pizzagate and fake news together to see.\n\n"‘Pizzagate’ shows how fake news hurts real people" - Washington Post, for example.\n\nFor the uninitiated, pizzagate is very very real. Read here to start:\n\nhttps://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com/\n\n
> I still think psychopathy is not fully understood because the actual high level ones will never allow themselves to be studied.\n\nthis is exactly right. All of the psychopaths the doctors studied have been "unsuccesful psychopaths" in that they couldnt handle or mask their urges. Successful psychopaths are more intelligent and skilled, and have the highest position on the food chain
Awesome post, thanks for sharing. Its important to note that the study used hypnotism.\n\nThe CIA doesn't want you to know that they mastered hypnosis over 50 years ago, it is one of their greatest assets.\n\nCheck out these documents if you havent already...\n\nhttp://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse
A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn will put you on the right track on how to be critical of the mainstream history narrative.\n\nThe rabbit hole goes much much deeper than this book but its a must read

The code is that they are calling for the opposite of what we usually term "working for humanity". To the Satanists they believe they are working for humanity through enslavement and offering opportunities of evil to the non-psychopathic populace. This is the one year warning from the top of the occulted power structure to start causing Hell on earth.
"They" refers to the shadow government, which have controlled US policy since WWII. Bobby and JFK (and JFK Jr) represented threats to their agenda and were neutralized. Teddy was happy to join the corruption cabal and is safe, even from major scandals.\n\n
Thanks a ton for this comment, a good angle to take.

I think they have the idea backwards. We are a projection from 4th dimension, and we have to evolve our consciousness beyond this projection reality and into the more complex, valid higher dimension.

sometimes it takes cataclytic movement to produce needed change. I agree there would be a lot of suffering in the short term.
I like your tier system. Does it go beyond tier 4?
They have been prepping for this possibility, and have planted new words for us like fake news to easily transition most of the populace into believing that all evidence is fake russian propaganda.\n\nA good portion of the country will be jolted awake and I imagine a lot of unrest would come of that but it would also generate an unprecedented renaissance once the dust clears.
Wow this seems like a very big find to me
Occam's Razor doesn't account for the condition of psychopathy. It has been proven that psychopaths go out of their way to manipulate and harm people simply for the enjoyment they derive from the manipulation and harm. And psychopaths saturate power structures, over time weeding out typically developed people through the same social mechanisms we use to weed out psychopaths from our spheres.
check out the reviews of kidzworld.com\n\nhttps://www.commonsensemedia.org/website-reviews/kidzworld/user-reviews/adult\n\n**Nope, never ever again**\n\n> I let my 9 year old cousin try out this site 6 months ago. I set the privacy settings and everything. I let her chat, make friends, and told her if you see someone mean or inappropriate, report them or tell me. She agreed. A week or two later, I decided to be a bad cousin and look at her account. (I let her post 1 picture of herself which was a HUGE mistake.....) I saw all these comments on her \n\n**PARENTS BEWARE!**\n\n> Within 3 hours of being on that website for the first time, my daughter was contacted by at least 3 adults who asked for photos of her legs in stockings, a miniskirt, etc. The website is a haven for predators and should be shut down.\n\n**UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!**\n\n**UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!**\n\n> It's obviously a dating site. I let my son play on there, and two girls asked him if he wanted to have sex. And MANY kids on there called him BAD names and try to convience him to go on drugs, smoke, and drinking &gt;:(. I am HIGHLY disapointed!

Its from another parent review on the review website I linked
A red star is a sign of the coming shift of energies and expansion of consciousness, synchronistically acompanied by major events in the world. The crowd became one and then the upside down metal stars became red halfway soon.\n\nCould be signaling something will happen soon.\n\n
Could their global control system that has lasted for centuries or more be consideres proof it works?\n\nIts not about this religión vs that but rather its about the power of the mind. They know how to unlock it and use it.

I am computer illiterate. I am sure I can figure out the operating system, I just have non clue how to do the complete uninstall of windows and installation of Linux. 
Touche' although are we not supposed to know when its right? I was making a guess that people just say "meh..they will do" just so they are not alone. 
I just recently realized I have this. I used to never be this way. 5 years ago i went through a terrible break up and just buried myself in work. I would not even consider talking to another lady, I just wanted to work. Well I moved to a new city an got a new job. Went to the holiday party an noticed some of the ladies checking me out. Anyn normal dude would of walked over and started a conversation. instead I had a panic attack in my head and I walked away. I could not even bring myself to say hello..That is not me..or at least was not me. Maybe that is not what this is but that is my 2 cents. 
So they took down half of the fbi's web pages\n

If your are a man who gets off touching dicks..big or small.then you are gay. Being a pedophile who touches boys makes you a piece of shit gay person instead of a normal functioning gay person. The catholic church is an always has been a criminal organization. The fact they still have tax free status as a religion is horseshit. The moment they put the image of their brand over the safety of children they solidified their position in the criminal underworld(lets not forget they helped smuggle nazis to freedom..guess that's how god wanted it.) \n\nBefore some people make assumptions. I base my opinions and anger off my experiences as a former catholic alter boy. 
Would settling not take away the chance at meeting that right person? No one want to be alone, yet settling does not seem right. Although it could explain why so many married people cheat.  
So this means they should kick out the pedophiles they have been protecting for decades. Being a pedo that touches boys still makes you gay..\n\n\nInteresting how priests being pedos is always defended on reddit. Maybe r/pedofriends is a run by the catholic church. 
4 penthouses and an outdoor survival magazine. Throw the penthouses at the enemy an when they gather round to look at boobs that's when I attack. 
I get what your saying. I saw settle and thought of experiences in my life. An the fact that many people will just be with someone so they are not alone. 
While I agree with your statement unfortunately it is. 
The hell you say...all bankers and anyone who loans money is out for themselves. 
This has been going on for decades. In the 90's I was sent to one at age 11. I had been sent to therapy after my grandmother died but never talked to the therapist. It was recommended and my .... of a mother agreed that i be institutionalized. Long story short, I was in a facility for 1 month, never talked tot hem either. 2 weeks in I went before a judge and the director of the place told him I needed to be there because I was a danger to society..2 weeks later my fathers insurance stopped paying..I was magically cured and released. Same thing for others in my unit. 
I am not seeing it. All family guy episodes are filled with innuendo of some sort and there is a strong homosexual thing going on with Stewie since the start of the show. I guess when he becomes a diaper model for CK or when they flee to Tx an he becomes a cross dresser to avoid the cops might be too much. \n\nBy your logic Jim Norton must be involved in Pizaagate since in his stand up he mentions being raped by his uncle.  
That is good. it was not last month as far as I knew..It was the safe place for pedos to discuss their perversions to supposedly not act on them,.

So your job makes money off the coinstar as well. If it did not there would not be one and customers could spend their money. I get it is company policy, yet if someone else has financial hardship an that annoys you..you need to examine yourself. 
LOL..If this is not a demonstration to the blue pilled that our government is a goddamn tumor on America we are doomed. I can only hope this wakes up the rest that we need to overhaul DC completely and start fresh..no dems..no republicans..no lobbyists. 2 yr term limit with no more 75k a year allowed to be made. After 2 years maybe a 30k a year for 2 more years severance package. No free healthcare, an if you are not re-elected. No more money for them. i cannot be fired and still collect checks\n
In all fairness coins are money. An sometimes in this economy coins are all some people have at the moment. I would be pissed too if I had $20 in coins an was about to lose 2$ of it to a coin star because you cannot be bothered. I do not drive, I do know 4@ is almost a gallon in some places.

That's why you keep your phone in the the fridge or another room in front of a radio playing.

Meh..they ban this sub then there would be no reason for me to continue to come to reddit. They do not care if we leave..it helps them keep their stories in check with the sheep.  Fuck em..they want to be sheep let em. After the DNC leaks where proven true time and time again and people still stay fighting about class,race,and economic status, instead of seeing it for what it is.I lost faith in people.

I lived in the county below this in the 90's that part of GA is still in the 50's when it comes to progression. An if it is anything like it was in the 90's nothing will come of this because the courts are clan run. The county I am talking about built their courthouse around the tree they used to hang people in. 
"credible originator" i.e. A guy that puts the words hentai in a dossier. \n\nHillary's tweet was why the deep state went after him duhhhhhh
With my high level of income it is not impossible to think I can live to be 2 maybe 300 years old. mean..I just read they put a pigs heart in a guy in Russia...\n\nDid he live?\n\nNo,he died but it's cool we're trying stuff like that. 
It was a three-peater.  It started with me being chased by some people trying to kidnap me..I was cornered and woke up. I fell back asleep an when I dreamed again i was caught by these people an they were threatening to do sick shit to me..i wo0ke up in a panic. Fell back asleep an when I started dreaming again I was free from the chair and running nthroiu8gh a warehouse..I get outside and make it to the fence to climb over and my Pops appears an asks where I am going..I woke up in a sweat and did not go back to sleep that night. \n\nI will point out that the crazy dream side effect of Chantix is real..\n\nI have a reoccurring dream a few time a year where I am shot in the head but do not die. I lay there with my ears ringing on the ground until i wake up feeling like it was all too real. I will have a very erie feeling that whole day too. Not chantix related though.
Paywall bullshit. Copypaste that shit into the comments\n
I use a bookcase cover. an never have the back of my phone facing up. That is when it is not sitting in a room I am not in with the radio playing. 
Childish decisions have adult consequences..fuck u/spez and his mother for allowing him to be born. 
She never paid attention to her son. (3 at the time) He only spoke an understood Haitian because that was his baby sitter. until I arrived. i taught him how to ask for things and pee like a man..I was digging little dude..she got extremely jealous of the attention I paid her son. Then I got a puppy and spent time trying to train it so it would not scare little dude. She got even more jealous of the dog because I spent more time with it than  her and her son..it ended when I came home from work and another dude was on the couch. 
Paywall can someone link it
fuck the geek squad. An who the fuck does best buy think it is with this goddamn appointment shit. If my computer breaks right now and i can make it there right now..you fucking help me right now..your not a goddamn apple store. 
The fbi has done nothing but create terrorists, cover for shitllary, kill innocnent women and children and spy on Americans before the cia took over..fucking waste of tax dollars..the actors on criminal minds are more competent than the actual fbi. 
Apologize now for my poor grammar. Just caught it. i am in 3 chat windows with techs trying to figure this out. 
When these people are actually held accountable for being greedy POS then it is news. Right now "facing an investigator" are words to appease the public while people forget this was a thing. 
Thank you for that. 
Wait..so from what I understand no one on politics liked her and all the memes suggested she was a complete fucking moron. An then the politicians demonstrated once again they care nothing about the American people and made her SoE anyway lol..Murica
I thought about this last night and it may have already been discussed before. I think this whole thing was set up to happen so there can be tighter control over the internet. They could not get us to start their race war,they could not get us to attack them for martial law. The see we see through them now, so they will use what they know pisses the real majority off.   I am not saying these people are not doing this shit, just that those emails being released around the time of Julian's vegan meal appears strange. Especially since there is a good chance wiki is compromised. 
This makes the blood boil. She claims to try to feed him protein shakes? How about real fucking food and be a goddam mother and not let your son live in those conditions. Goddamit it makes me angry her prison cell will be more accommodating then what she forced her son to live in.\n\nSidenote_ This is the one time a man can without provocation beat the goddam brakes off a woman. 
All the protesters who participated could crowd source their $70k apology for acting on emotion instead of logic.

hahaha. I understand how they work and they should say that in the title. Just like I did in my first comment. "50% of the people interviewed"<---remember? The title is meant to generalize an lead a topic. It does not represent everyone,only those asked and then based on that scientific assumptions are made about everyone else. Every poll title does it, i do not like it.,  
I would prefer finding the one in the end.But that is me. One of my early chefs did not get married until he was 61 years old. he finally found his soulmate. dis still kicking at 75 an they are still happily married.  I understand your view though.

Devils advocate here- With modern technology, hairlines can be fixed. Not saying it is him. I am saying fuck..I saw the pic an immediately thought of RP. If all white women look the same (to me an i am white) it is not to far off surmise that most white men look the same too.

Ahhh..Thank you.This seems on par with the kind of people bankers are. 
Well for starters this is not an alt right sub. This is a sub for EVERYONE to discuss conspiracies openly. Unfortunitly we have redditors like Mr. Joshua Goldberg who post here pretending to be nazis to discredit this sub as a whole. There are jerk off racists here and there are jerk off shill here. Both meant to discredit the topics being discussed here and are the next best thing to calling someone pedos..surprised y'all have never used that tactic. \n\nThe fact that you try to claim this sub as alt right an you have only been a redditor for 22 days with 12k plus karma says a lot about your intentions. Your post history and the things you talk about do as well. This is where i stop my communications with you, as I do not wish to waste more of my time while you collects nickels to post false titles about this sub. \n\n
There is a benefit to his death sentence. He is really small and if any of the black gangs did not make him their bitch the whites would. Now he can safely wait his death in a solitary cell for the next 20 years of appeals. Also keeps him from recanting when he starts having visions of his programming.

No. The sprint people kept deflecting and answering questions I was not asking. That may because their English is not so good. They told me to just get a new phone. File a claim and that my phone must be defective. Samsung guy..also not a native English speaker kept telling me the TURKthing was on his phone too and would not address the japan government or government root access question\n
50% of Trump fans INTERVIEWED. I hate these misleading titles. This is r/conspiracy not nthe trumpet or thedon or whatever. Click bait titles are for sheep.  While I do not doubt PG in anyway, I fucking hate when polls are mislabeled. Please do not contribute to the dumbing down of us by copy and pasting a click baity misleading title. 
Problem fixed itself..now if the co founder of reddit can write an open letter about how he dislikes and does not approve of r/pedofriends we can become a better world one day at a time.

OH LOOK! The Washington post is trying to discredit "crazy conspiracies" with the MSM corporate media invented retarded flat earth theory
Yes the one bullet he "shot" (witnesses report no gunfire) hit the computers hard drive. ahaha
They are running at Floyd
nice copy pasta
This month I've red-pilled hard on pizzagate. I heard about it in passing when it happened initially and kinda brushed it off and did not delve into it. Thank you to you and the people like you that kept at it!
ahahah this is the shill from thread op llinked. not even trying

Its the only angle MSM corporate media push when they do theses articles. They like to make the person look silly because of flat earth but fail to talk about the other theories they believe.\n\n  They even push thier personal opinions and attack the person to discredit "I don’t know how many flights Irving has taken as a professional basketball player. I’m sure it’s a lot. But I guess he’s never seen the curvature of the Earth. I’m not sure why he thinks he plays NBA games in different time zones, but I now know that he doesn’t believe it’s because the globe is rotating."

Proof?
This man has done more work for this country than anyone in this thread 
Proof? 
Proof in the Wikileaks he worked for Hillary, constantly shit on Bernie for being old. \nNone of the shills will touch this thread. 
Then why did he vote them in?
Great content, thank you for your bravery. 
Justice caps for everyone. 
Link?
Ctr: PISSGATE IS REAL! SEE THE CELEBS EVEN SAY SO!\n\nAlso ctr: uhm pizzagate is so not real, just check snopes. 
Nah trumps not stupid, he just has wolves in sheeps clothing all around him. \nWhat happened in Yemen was because of a leak.\nThe deep state + Johnson McCain had access to the script with Michael Flynn and Russia. Which led to Flynn resigning.\n\nWhy would trump do this to himself?

Ole Barry going back to his activism days. Since their Saul alinsky tactics took a huge fucking hit they're trying to build an army. 
Trump could 100% use it against the CIA 
Wow someone on the left assuming my bias? How dare you! 
give it time or just stop worrying about it. Is it that hard to ignore a thread? 
hey dude you're needed in r/pissgate
Lmao what a cry baby 
nope 
and you flair yourself with MWHC. Questionable the worst thing to happen to hardcore IE EXPIRE 
You are literally the worst at what you do 
Here's the deal, I'm not the only person that feels this way \n\nHow about you ask ray and porcel about their friends beating up gay people trying to get into cbgb's
Is that why mark zuckerburg coined the term "fake news" to shun out all other media outlets that weren't in the mainstream? 
what are you talking about? 
best band from the Midwest 
He lost 3 million. 
Deleted a post because it was actually a shit show I have nothing to hide I am a PROUD DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER AND I SHITPOST ON YOU PEOPLE FOR FREE
He said it live, I can't find a source
hahaha wow personal attacks, are you getting mad at the fact I may be right?
Yea because that's what I said 
yea let's just strawman trump and completely ignore the fact that he got fired because lied about a phone call. \n\nLeft: OMG THIS IS IT GUYS!!! WE FINALLY CAUGHT OUR GOVERNMENT! PISSGATE IS REAL!!! 
Well they cut his ad funding this morning so there goes your dismissive narrative 
Lmao everyone posting milo stuff thinks that this is such a huge victory for them 
yea because it never happens to people on the right 
oh now I'm facing agism? How can I ever combat you people!
Lol dude how does it feel to literally suck David Brock pee pee 
username checks out 
Why does john McCain have permission to listen in all calls? 
Lmao I never lied I just said can you prove it 
Yea I'd much rather watch this than chunk yogurt 
Hey you said it, I never did :) 
Or how about the fact there was real actual emails with REAL proof that the legacy media outlets were colliding with the Hillary camp THE WHOLE TIME.\n\nPeople forget that these same outlets were propping up Hillary over Bernie. A majority of the mainstream talk shows/cable news were always shitting on bernie. They did the same to trump, and constantly lie. \n\nWant more proof? Debbie wasserman had to step down because of those emails. Guess who took her spot... Donna Brazile, who got fired from CNN for the same thing. The media lies, these people have so much corporate interest and certain agendas.
yea not really, any proof? Can you prove I voted for trump?
This seems 100% real! Thanks for sharing OP! Very well sourced. You've actually have convinced me with this link!
Yes I 100% disagree with any numb skull that could actually believe a dossier that had the word hentai in it. You know it's so funny when people post like this, they literally want to generalize everyone commenting and then assume me for doing it. You're doing the same fucking thing man.
Okay? 
Because I played a show with ray, Porcell and mike judge and they sat in the green room and bitched about how they hate the new kids 
Literally your whole comment history is correct the record rhetoric, not calling you a shill but it's funny to see how rabid you people get :) 
right, you're next 
Yes, as I sit here and piss you people off the fundings are racking in, I could do this forever 
Of course you're smiling, this guy hasn't done ANYTHING bad, he's just a troll. There is irrefutable amounts of evidence and connection to THE REAL PEDOS trying to take him out. 
And see you will see the same people that want to prop up pissgate (one dude) and defame anything pizzagate (literally a global network) \n\nI got a huge headache from all the shills upvoting their agenda but it's just time to shit post until they get mad 
uh yea pretty fucking shocking considering that this whole ordeal doesn't mean shit and the left is trying so fucking hard to come back from the BUTT FUCKING they received in November. Why else would ctr upvote something like this? 
Eh well you could just join the default subs, it's more friendly over there. 
yea buddy once again you lost when you propped up a dossier that talked about hentai and I'm not really mad because my orange emperor is still in office <3

I love the fear mongering people try to do in this sub. \n\nLook Hilary and trump took a pic together!!! He's just gonna drop out and give the election to her! \n\nI think people forget not just anyone can go work at Goldman Sachs. If you needed to run a ship wouldn't you hire experienced sailors? 
Do you have a crush on me dude? I appreciate it. I understand that Valentine's Day is a very lonely day for ctr Scum fucks like you \n\nAlso you are stalking me and I'm going to report this to the mods so your bullshit won't be on the sub again :) happy posting you pedophile defending piece of shit. I'll be sure to save your name and crack your dumb ass when the arrests happen 
because it probably was lol 
Okay, so instead of actually saying something with substance you want to point this out. Seems to me you yourself have an agenda. 
lol you people reach for anything 
fine print?
Great reminder to be on the look out for comments like this that are trying to shape the narrative instead of discuss them
Do you have any proof that this man is a pedo
Do you have links to any of your argument? Any sort of legit real proof? I know he tells his little pointless lies but I would love to see the other things you're talking about 
He got rid of the tpp, his DHS is cracking down on pedophiles, he's cracking down on illegal immigration, he's strengthening our borders. Yea really sounds like he doesn't care about our people. 
Yes! The god emperor himself pays me to shit all over people like you  
right because this is totally not my post 
Yea and I guess he's actually going to shoot someone on 5th avenue, get the hell out of here 
I'm a trump supporter and I post here because it's actually good information instead of just circle jerking about trump. There is stuff in this sub that should be top page for them all the time but instead they choose to talk about a guy from Star Trek and the size of a crowd 
Oh wow is someone on the left really denying him coming out as a victim??? Tisk tisk
Where's the conspiracy? 
Lol u just told me to get my head out of trumps ass dude you're mad, I stopped taking you seriously after fucking posting a dossier that has the word hentai in it 
the dildos
Don't ignore them, that fucking top post has ctr all over it. If you can hijack one of the top comments, the people from r/all will see it 
>There is nothing positive to say about this what is positive about this story?\n\nDid I say that? No. I'm saying instead of actually talking about it or posting some theory to this you want to bring down other posters. \n\nHere's some theory: Trump is surrounded by wolves right now. Priebus gives him many suggestions and he has several back ups for his cabinet. I posted this to keep an eye on the fucker because it's very likely trump wasn't aware of this. 
Lol y u mad bro!!!!! 
yea I can really tell by the upvotes I'm getting and the downvotes you're getting.
Lol trump is doing everything he said he was going to do 
eh I think I'm alright 
proof? 
Prove me wrong bub
Google skinhead youth 
Lol the shills can try to grill him but the Donald will ban anyone at the whiff of going against anything they stand for. This should be fucking great. Hopefully it's not just a circle jerk 
lol I'm being called a shill so I'm gonna have to say it's fair game that you new accounts literally have David Brock in your asshole as we speak, since you know you guys have 100% proof I'm a "shill" from the Donald. How about we message one of the mods from the Donald that banned me.\n\nI love these please keep em coming \nIs this your new technique, single out one shit poster that's completely sick of week old accounts ruining this sub to prop up their shitty agenda?
Eh, depends on what your job entails.\n\nI can usually blow through two days' worth of work in 6 hours of working from home (mostly because I have a lab at home and can do around 50x more work than I can using our datacenter's machines). A bunch of my co-workers work from home while taking care of their kids and the company is still doing well. So I guess it really depends on a lot of factors.
There IS a way.

The illustration isn't a witty political statement in its original context (and it hasn't been edited for skin colors here). Seriously, run Google Image Search for 'put on oxygen mask before children sign', it's literally the first result here.

Ding ding ding, this was the question that kept my entire team up at night after we started poking around. Why the fuck could we turn a car on over a wireless network and completely get around the key fob? Why the shit could we trip the brakes or cause the dashboard/speedometer/everything to simply never come back. Or be replaced with whatever image we want? The answer: laziness and greed.

They were asked to resign in formal letters given to them. So they did. It's the polite way to fire at those sorts of levels in both government and business.
Go to the UP sometime (technically not part of the Mitten, I guess...); it's nothing but signs for Democrat candidates/Crooked Hillary. I think I saw two Republican signs on the entire stretch of US-2 spanning St. Ignace to Escanaba back in July.
Hacknet's another great one. :D
Yeah they are, or something close to it (been almost 3 years and two career changes now). But that doesn't help when you can access everything through SSH via wifi or a USB-Ethernet adapter. The knowledge comes from a little reverse engineering. Never took a bright person on my team more than a few weeks to get the hang of things.
Pretty much. Quickest way to become 'truscum' (their word), if you're transsexual, is to call them on this shit.
The redeeming part of this is that 97% of 2xChro is dudes pretending to be chicks.
Wow, they blamed Russia when the potential, original creators were Israeli men (arrested; Mirai was used on the DDOS attack on Krebsonsecurity whose report ostensibly led to their arrests). Mirai was then 'released' on a few hacking/hacker forums, and can be downloaded from Github pretty readily. It's pretty standard fair which really only shines in that there's some clever/neat automation going on for cross-compiling across a bunch of different architectures.\n\nInternet of Shit strikes again!\n\nNote: there has been a steady ramping up of DDOS attacks against internet backbones and DNS servers going on for the last year or two; kind of stress-testing the internet. There *IS* someone out there trying to break the internet -- or at least trying to figure out how to -- and they're likely state-sponsored, but the one on Friday doesn't really strike me as tangential, given the circumstances. But what do I know.
Think of it like downloading a compiled program. You get the .exe and run it, and that's about the end of it. No way to modify it unless you have the source code...\n\nOr run it through a debugger and reverse engineer it. Which isn't in the game, but really NEEDS to be, because that's a huge part of the hacking scene and it could open up so many more roles and hnngh

This was happening at my job (I work in network security/penetration testing) until I pointed out that everything in our workplace is INFORMATION this and INFORMATION that. The etymology of Cyber Whatever actually makes a lot more sense when you get to certain levels , due to its etymological roots basically being that of governance and control. It's cringy sounding, for sure, thanks to it being abused in the media, but it's still better than phrases like Big Data or other techno-weenie-isms that get tossed about.
QR Extreme on my Nexus 5X does it just fine, if that helps. If it's the corruption stuff throwing you off, you can rerun the call a few more times to hopefully move the corruption around on the image until you get a hit. \n\nDTR also has a QR script (forget the context), but it's a little pricey to run after the first few goes.
Man, I would love an explanation (or tutorial) on how you made the walking so smooth for these. Been wanting to make some utility mechs for my bases.

Ah man, this game was great. I got into it when I was ~14 (2002) after a friend had snagged a copy from a certain domicile for canine abandonware. He talked about it like it was the best game ever, and I eagerly awaited the couple-hundred-megabyte file transfer through AIM to finish overnight so I could see what all the fuss was about.\n\nBooted it up, got through the first dungeon and holy fuck, I've never played a game before or since that so readily immersed me in its setting. The sounds were great, the game was completely first person (I'd only ever played turn-based JRPGs to that point), the cities (at the time) felt alive and crowded, and some of the things made me shit literal bricks (vengeaaaaaaaance). Turned into a werebear, turned into a vampire, did quests for daedra lords and witches involving too many tongues and other sundry organs. But most of all, the soundtrack STILL remains one of the best of any video game I've ever played.\n\nSeriously, I've yet to play a game whose soundtrack so perfectly captures 'snowfall'. I'm not joking about that. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsPvwPnznWo & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9bsBMLo6XU&index=26&list=PLDWrj6ynqDMHlvwaYcx90U4B8xVXTci9p ) Other tracks made the dungeons feel absolutely claustrophobic and the nights feel alien and bizarre ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5u-3Oaj1Ao&index=23&list=PLDWrj6ynqDMHlvwaYcx90U4B8xVXTci9p ). It really stuck with me, to the point where, 14 years later, I'm still getting the songs stuck in my head during winter and the like.\n\nGreat game, still holds up pretty well if you're into old RPGs and all the jankery that goes into it. If you're an old fan and/or wanting more, I highly recommend 'The Quest' on Steam/iOS ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/428880/ )
http://ethankaminski.com/fanstuff/hackmud/coding-info.html\n\nCheck that out; then check out codecademy about JavaScript ( https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript ), or any other kind of resource. The only limitation, that I know of, is  on letting the script escape from the sandbox (this would be a huuuuuuuuge security vulnerability). 
Ditto.\n\nWe need some experience in interstellar warfare if we're going to properly create the Terran Empire.

Seconding this. The CZ-75 is one of the nicest firearms I've ever had the pleasure of using. My only complaint is that I can't have one as a carry-piece due to my baby-sized thumbs. It just feels more solid than any other automatic handgun I've ever shot. Recoil is nice and predictable, weight is fantastic, well-balanced, and all-around a fine piece of Eastern European engineering.

Out of curiosity, what is the mental/physical basis for transgenderism that you speak of in your post? Do you mean the debate between the SJWs and people who believe dysphoria is required to be considered it? Or the potential root cause of the issue being either a physical abnormality (eg: brain structure) or mental disorder?

I was in the middle of my transition when the ACA passed. Everything I had been covered for under my old plan disappeared. Price went up to $200/week (A WEEK). Got a new plan on the marketplace. Couldn't get my prescriptions filled for <$300. Endocrinologist got arrested because he decided to do the right thing and game the system, marking all transgender procedures as other hormone-related things to get insurance coverage for people who weren't making enough -- someone snitched on him. Was told by an insurance rep to 'go to Canada' if I needed hormones. Had to go two long years ordering shady crap off the literal darkweb to continue transitioning. \n\nWatched as my new marketplace plan got useless shit like acupuncture and homeopathy added to its benefits. Insurance company DEMANDED to have a doctor of theirs come by for a home visit so they could 'make sure everything was okay', then tried to make me feel like shit for denying them. Greeted a rep and the doctor half-naked at my door with a shotgun and a hatchet. Never heard from them again; cops laughed about it though, apparently it was pretty common since they started these 'wellness checkups'.\n\nBut, hey. If you don't mind over budget, behind schedule and having every last shred of your privacy invaded, the left is TOTALLY fighting for us trannies. Yeah, they really, really care about you and want to make sure you have the best in healthcare coverage, you can keep your plana dasdny oru dfoctuer oh god i puked help \n\ntl;dr: obamacare was my redpill moment thx obammerz
Maybe you should edit all those slurs out of your post then.  :(
What the fuck dude, don't say that about African American people. Not cool :(
Hi, I'm from T_D and this dude's off the rails.
Damn, that is spot on.
One, it's mostly Python you can pick up in a day or two of quick study. The hard part is reverse engineering the CAN signals being sent and mapping it all out. From there, you can just do everything through a command prompt. No specialized software needed. \n\nTwo, gain: depends on how creative you are. Almost every head unit interfaces with your phone. Syncs contacts and their details, text messages, emails, call history, GPS locations. Not to mention even more personalized things like internet radio and Yelp accounts, etc. It could be a pretty good attack surface on the financial side of things. On the destructive side... Well, let your mind go wild.
Always wanted to write urban fantasy after getting into that series, it's the best curse. :3

Because the game is about puzzles and solving them. Every aspect of the game, from the moment you boot it up, is a system, or systems, that can be broken and exploited. Things work within their system. This applies to users and stuff.

Thank you for correcting the record
Wow, same here, except a small town in the UP is my source of anxiety. Feels bad man
Ugh, this post is leavening me with a bad taste in my mouth. Thanks for that.
Yeah, that's a valid question. Truth is test setups aren't hard to come by when factories switch products (our factory had them in a box under a tarp in an area with no cameras for weeks before the place closed), so instantly you save yourself a lot of effort and money by dumpster diving the right places. As for two way command. I can think of three models that execute a script package named certain ways off a USB drive (software updates aren't OTA in most tmk), and it's all just shell scripting off of that. Most of them have some form of SSH available to them, and a lot have wifi capabilities.  So, not that unfeasible to write something that can talk back.
Like I said somewhere else in the thread, I can't comment on specific makes/models due to NDAs. However, in general, I'd avoid ones that have head units that interface with stuff like the brakes and tires and steering (auto-parking, piezoelectrical nonsense, etc.) and if something has wi-fi or its own internal phone touted as a feature avoid it like the plague. While the features SOUND cool, or are downright practical, from my experience in the industry there's some extremely lazy development practices and nobody bothers to isolate systems properly even when they know the risks (these developers work 80-90 hours a week  with extremely tight deadlines at the threat of losing their jobs and/or being shipped back overseas).\n\n\nIf you feel like getting hacky, plug in a USB-Ethernet adapter, hook it into a router and run some port scans if it pulls an IP address. A good one shouldn't be advertising Port 22 or 23 (defaults for SSH/Telnet, respectively). Also research around whatever model you're going to buy's forums and blogs; chances are, if it can be opened up, people are working on doing it, or have done it. 
Do you have a link by any chance? I missed it!\n
As someone who used to work on headunits, that terrifies me MORE than plugging it into a desktop or laptop. So, so easy to access the CAN bus through those things. Augh.
The Vampire Slayer did their job. Yes, it is a tragedy that a young human was infected by vampirism, and yes, it is fortuitous that the child predated only upon livestock. But how long would that hold out? And that livestock may have been the only thing keeping more people alive in times of strife or famine. Survival is pragmatic, and all signs point to the elves being to blame, as always.
Yes, yes, and kinda, in that order.\n\nMultiple locks can be added at the same time; been a few weeks since I last played due to real life hacking and crunch time on projects, but there's some limit on how many distinct kind you can have loaded (only one per type; might be based on upgrade slots or sys.init; can't remember right at this moment). \n\nSomeone can still take your money using a malicious script; otherwise they'll have to break your locks (to my knowledge); and that's all of them that you have loaded.\n\nE: You won't see the locks if you try to breach yourself (which makes some sense); other people will.
I mean, I made a botnet out of a particular model to convince my company to remove wifi from the model. They're just computers, most everything you'd want to do to a normal machine is possivle, with the added benefit of being mobile. Also phone numbers, contact names, internet radio choices, calls in-out, etc. I can see it being a phisher's wet dream.
Depends on how integrated with the car it is. I can't say any makes or models due to NDAs, but a few from Japan and licensed out from there are particularly bad. It's mostly due to shitty programming more than necessity though.
For the most part, it's basically anyone/anything about art/internet-fucking/writing/etc. (mostly internet-fucking and art) involving anthropomorphized animals -- eg: Disney's Robin Hood, Animaniac's Minerva Mink, and other weeb and degenerate trash. Some of the trash is pretty good even from a purely artistic standpoint (it's 99% porn like everything else), but it's a semi-online-huge... set (or sub-set?) of different online and real life communities. And, unfortunately, a lot of  current ctrl-left mindset took root, or possibly started, there and has been slowly infecting it since the end days of Bush Jr., at least. 
I would legit do terrible things for a mecha game like this meeting Elite: Dangerous.\n\nDoubly so if, to pilot in hardcore super-elite combat you had to program your mech on the fly to do crazy combat maneuvers, like they did in the show.
You laugh, but the thread about the topic on Hacker News had this exact fucking exchange in it more than once.
Yeah, I've done all that; I have a few EZ locks and some C00* ones loaded, but none of them seem to be applying? I can use my alt to breach my loc by providing no lock arguments the way I would if, say, I ran into a lock on an NPC location.
You misunderstand. The hints are straight up the game telling you 'fuck you', since you'll probably have guessed the EXACT solution hours before figuring out the proper way of inputting it.
Pretty sure SRA stands for Satanic Ritual Abuse in this context.
I really wish these cucks in GR would stop crying. My car can only handle so much salt.
Michigander here. LL Bean stuff is mandatory for living this time of year.
That's a really good idea. Huh.
Pursuant to this, having a... Record Keeper? (totally blanking on the position) will make the numbers shown there more accurate; with increasing resolution as the Oberbraufurher gets better at counting.
Well, that's certainly a retort that will work. 
Skyrim, Fallout 4 and/or Witcher 3 would be solid choices if you like free roam RPGs and your computer can handle them (get to know your machine specs and always read the requirements). Skyrim gets some hate these days, some of it's warranted. If you find that you like it and if you want more, give Elder Scrolls Online a shot (It's an MMORPG).\n\nNew Vegas is a great choice for the PC, but if you beat it on PS3 and don't want to get into modding just yet, I'd say wait until it goes on sale.\n\nWhat other games did you play amd enjoy on the Playstation? Look for some similar ones on Steam. Read reviews, go hog wild.
I agree with this as a historic landmark.\n\nHowever, you know what we really need to do? We need to get out to the Belt, start analyzing rocks for heavy and precious metals, start looking for a way to either return those to a lunar orbit for later processing and mining, or utilizing them in-situ. We need to stake a claim out there and use those resources, via private companies, to jump-start cheaper space missions, industry and transport here, with the eventual goal of bootstrapping us into a Kardashev-2 type civilization. \n\nMars is cool, but utilitarian-me says the Belt is where we really need to be.
Now if only I could make xfce or i3 look this good. ;-;
I love how people downvote in this thread, even though it's a completely subjective topic.\n\nThat said, give Verdun a shot.
They've already handed out ~81 waivers.\n\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-travel-ban-emergency-stay-20170128-story.html
Considering Apple computers are some of the worst-made computers (read: NOT worst performance; they're decent developer machines, and are *reasonably* future-proofed, but good luck for power-user stuff and maintenance/upgrading) for their price-point out there (wasn't always true), they've kind of missed that point.\n\nThey're more like some of the matrix terminals/cyberdecks you'd find in Shadowrun; Fairlight Excalibur, Transys Highlander, CMT Avatar, etc. High price, *good* performance, but certainly not cutting edge in a lot of areas.\n\nIf you want something like what you describe, you'd be looking more at something like OriginPC, Xidia, Falcon NW, Puget, etc. Smaller-time custom shops.
Watched so many of my high school buddies, and their parents, come back missing limbs, brain damaged or under draped flags. Some of them never came back at all, even though it looked like they walked off the plane.
In my opinion, since I literally just stopped my game to change away; it's way too noisy, especially if you're in an area with a lot of bubble bulbs or something. Lots of visual clutter between grass and plants.\n\nLove the spritework, but it was hurting my eyes when the game was running (not entirely your fault; I have been awake for 36 hours).
Ehhhh, it's actually one of those weird areas within the transgender/sexual community. A lot of us, like myself, consider it to be, and are waiting for better technological breakthroughs to happen before we ever imagine going for the big snip (it isn't a snip, it's actually a pretty horrific process; there are videos of the surgery online if you're *really* curious) and, welp, while the fields required to do one successfully have advanced, and the surgery itself can actually produce a set of 'female' genitalia that can do things like become aroused (sans, uh, lubrication and the like) and feel pleasure in similar ways to their natural counterparts, it's still pretty primitive and can *also* result in things like an increased risk for blood clots (which you're *already* at a higher risk of being on estrogen), permanent pain, or just a completely feelingless mass of flesh, among other complications. \n\nAnd that's not even talking about scar tissue and the fact that your skin thins on hormones, making, ahem, vigorous attention an adventure. For some transgender women, the urge to be rid of their male genitalia is so great that, I guess, it can help to get the surgery as soon as possible. I wouldn't know. Dysphoria is a mental disorder and it effects different people different ways. \n\nWhat is curious is this inmate being able to get it up. Most trannies I know lost that ability pretty early into their hormone therapies, or, at the very least, it takes almost herculean efforts to keep up. Makes me wonder about this person's dosage, if they even had any. The pictures I'm finding don't look like they had transitioned at all. But that's off topic.
Caveat emptor: The game released the other day; servers have been getting set on fire pretty regularly -- this is a result of unexpected playerbase size (there were 700 people on before the servers went down for maintenance earlier today; more than any other MUD I've ever played on), unfortunate database fuckery (MongoDB? A problem? Color me shocked) and some netcode issues.\n\nSole developer is aware of all the issues and getting the servers stable is his number one goal at the moment.
There's a few different schools of Satanism. The one you probably got is the Satanic Bible by Anton Szandor LaVey, who is basically an 'atheist satanist'. \n\nThere's one school out there called the Temple of Set, founded by Michael Aquino, a lieutenant colonel of the US Army's psychological warfare program during the late 60s and early 70s. His stuff is notably more spooky, which only makes sense, since it was written by a bunch of spooks. Look him up sometime if you want to get really weirded out.\n\nThe Order is also pretty creepy, and I'm not even going to bother putting their full name out there because I don't like neo-Nazis. They're also a bunch of atheistic satanists, but with more of a thought toward the hermetic and pagan traditions; unfortunately, their stuff has been taken and run with pretty far in one or two instances.
I'm pretty sure she was based more on Major Motoko from GITS, but I could be misremembering the interview they had with the Wachowski siblings (either way, she had/has a pretty often used aesthetic for the razorgirl archetype).
Thank you for correcting the record
Sorry, it's a game about hacking; I'm not going to just TELL you.\n\nHint: Think about users and stuff.
But muh abiogenesis
"I think a wizard did it!"  The technician yelled over the sound of industrial-sized water pumps and the constant murmuring of the fire crew. Black smoke roiled out of the datacenter, bringing the delicious smell of money and carcinoma with it. And, somewhere, Baader-Meinhoff reached through the vaulted ceiling of the approaching thunderstorm and delivered a swift kick right to my nuts.\n\n"What did you just say, Zubrowski?" I yelled back.\n\n"I said: I think a wizard did it!" The portly, balding man gestured with his hands; "One second I'm lifting up the floor tiles to run some fiber, and the next: snakes!"\n\n"Snakes!"\n\n"Snakes! Then fire! *Fwoosh!*" He grinned, nodded and gestured with his hands again, almost too enthusiastic about the turn of events. The half-visible flashes of big, dead data coming from melting server racks *was* pretty, though, so I'd forgive him that. "Didn't come from any of the machines or lines, just... *everywhere* all at once!"\n\nI watched the fire crew unwind another hose and add it to the mix for a few moments, chewing on a packet of snus with my front teeth pensively. "S'what I thought," I grumbled.\n\n"What?" Zubrowski asked.\n\n"Tell the Boss I'm taking a vacation day, and talk to the inspector for me."\n\n"Bu-but," he stammered as I turned and walked away, once I was out of direct line of sight, I turned and hooked into an alley. My hands roamed over my body quickly, efficiently, just like my old man had taught me. Mental checkup time.\n\n\n.38 Snub-Nose: Check.\n\nCell-Phone: Check.\n\nAmulet: Check.\n\nSpell Pocketbook: Check.\n\nSilver Bell: Check.\n\nGoblet... Well, my water bottle would have to suffice.\n\nEnchanted Blade: Check.\n\nWand: Missing a chunk out of its copper butt-cap; Check.\n\nI tugged the tiny pewter cross my parents had given me in high school out from under my collar, pulled it up over my head and let it dangle in front of me in the alleyway. With all the flashing lights being reflected off the buildings, I'd be pretty safe from any passers-by for just enough time. My eyes slid shut, and I started humming under my breath, chanting that started as a solid tone slowly gaining volume and clarity.\n\n"*Om mani padme hum, om mani padme hum, om mani padme hum...*" \n\nAwareness and feeling drained through the soles of my feet, only to be replaced by an over-presence of my surroundings. Like through time, I felt each and every brick as it was being placed in the walls around me, felt the alleyway and all the disjointed intercourses, drug deals and murders that had happened within it. The town went from frontier Indian-trading settlement to lazy riverside town to bustling mini-opolis in fleeting moments, then crumbled into sand with the future yet realized. Light suffused me; my *aura*, a flitting, pale thing that bubbled and writhed along my arms. There it was; the astral plane, third eye opened; Tool would have a field day with this shit.\n\nGently, like trying to scoop something out of a half-full bathtub, I pulled part of that light into the dull metal of the cross hanging from my fingertips, *willed* it into the necklace until it vibrated in my altered vision. The thing was a gift, a protective instrument due to its origin, sentimental and a battery for magic power.\n\n"*Finden sich... fur micht...*" I whispered in shitty, half-remembered German. The words weren't necessary, not really, but they helped my mind make a connection with the night I'd inadvertently crafted this particular spell; shrooms and too much booze and maybe a couple episodes of Magical Girl anime, naked and covered in Oil of Abramelin. The cross froze in time and space, existing at all points simultaneously for just the briefest of moments, and then the bit of my aura I had pushed into it budded away from the arms, became a small, two-dimensional dog that flicked its ears this way and that, before pointing in a direction. The necklace began to tug at my fingers, and I opened my eyes.\n\n"Well, alright then," I muttered as I closed down my link with the astral plane and traced the direction of the cross as it hung horizontally in the air in front of me. I went down the alley a bit, and the pendant shifted to point at the wall in front of me. Again in the other direction. Up, down. "The college, huh?"\n\nI left the alley and started walking toward the well-lit campus a few blocks away. "Cool. Let's kill us a warlock."\n\n
You need a better title.
They are not allies. They are not a part of US hegemony. They are part of the regimes that Wesley Clark has mentioned we've been aiming to topple. Why people are confused about why those specific counties baffles me.
It doesn't matter that the device is encrypted. The point is that Google collects your data. 
Google has been sneaky plenty of times. Like sniffing WiFi from their Maps cars in Europe or secretly getting around Safari's security settings. And it isn't just to collect data for their search engine. It goes far beyond that.\n\nMicrosoft is trying to get into the same game, obviously. Transitioning from a high income company to a data collector. Now Windows phones home all the time. Instruments of the state.
How do you use it? Is it a replacement for Mission Control? Or are you using it with multiple computers?
If it's high level criminals we are after, then they will use encryption no matter if it's a default on phones. They will find a way. Not everyone is as dumb and arrogant as Podesta. And you can't stop math from happening. \n\nAt the same time, a ban on encryption puts the data of billions of regular users at risk. \n\nIt endangers the majority in the service of catching low-level criminals and perhaps a few dumbasses up at the top. I just don't see how this is any anyway helpful in the long run, and if Comey is smart, then this was a ploy to communicate the need for cooperation (even if secret). 
No. They are a government backed entity. They can do no wrong.
Interesting comment. Question for you. What type of bonds would you buy?\n\nOpinions on an upcoming deleveraging? Cheers!
Of it's a long distance charger that comes with the phone, I'm thinking that 10 percent would still be helpful even if not visibly so. \n\nThe Apple Watch takes 2 hours to charge to 100%. And that's a much smaller battery and with a direct, magnetic connection. The Apple Watch Series 2 has a 273 mAh capacity and the iPhone 7 has a 1960 mAh capacity. So, assuming it has the same power as the magnetic charger, that's roughly 14 hours until a full iPhone Charge.\n\nThat's probably an optimistic scenario, too. Wireless power is probably a fraction of what the magnetic charger is providing. What if it's 1/5th or 1/10th? Actually, 1/5th would be a 10-hour Apple Watch recharge. Maybe this is for the rumored Apple Watch revamp later this year?
I wonder if there is room in the lineup for a high end necklace design. (Like maybe a stainless steel chain or something). Maybe one that has other health tracking features associated with it.
Looking at the comments, this seems to run as a user. Was it unintentionally installed? Any more to this story?
Love Bill Maher's quote: "I want to say to Bill and Hillary 'thank you for 30 years of service. Now I never want to see you again.'"
A lot of this stuff is either subjective or wasn't possible given Congress. 
If people remember accurately, Obama has he most scaled back plan of everyone. Do people not remember that calls to war? Arming Ukraine? This was done at a higher level than Obama, and he nixed their plans in favor of a proxy war.
I didn't realize that alarms could have titles? Was it going to set up a reminder or something? \n\nIn any case, once had the title, it didn't set the actual time.
Damage would only be share price. So possibly a shareholder revolt. Not sure of it would actually happen. Clearly no danger now.\n\nI also don't agree that Apple needs to immediately pay off all of its debt. Unless we are sure there is going to be another deflationary cycle (which there are signs of, but then again, Russia, China and Iran are trying to get off using the dollar for oil transactions.).
Anybody doing a live blog?
Well, Israel in what form? Israel is a Western proxy in the Middle East. In its proper form, we should all be supporters of Israel.
Saudi money is on both sides. Saudi money was involved in the corruption of the DNC (and removal of Bernie as a candidate).
They have enormous carte blanche even as an ally. But this is nothing new. There is a reason for this, and it relates to the US reliance on Saudia Arabia as part of US hegemony.
Because these theories are shit and make the sub look bad.
Also, their competitors were already doing stuff like this. 
In general, our food is awful. Fruits and vegetables are more flavorful in Europe and Asia. Bars never have anything decent to snack on. Too much fucking sugar in desserts (I've heard it's worse in Brazil, which makes sense given their massive sugar industry). There is also a dearth of affordable places to eat out that are healthy. The US is getting better though.
Not all phones are compromised. And the mics for these home devices seem to be better (not rustling in the pocket as well).
If you're hoping for the stock to go down, I'm sure it will underperform its peers as usual unless there is a crash. So you shouldn't be disappointed depending on your time horizon. 
Answers like these are why I'm leaning toward getting a 4K at 24-27 inches instead of a 3440x1440 21:9 widescreen option. For one, it's cheaper. I also have another crappy monitor that I can use for a different (and older) computer. \n\nOn the other hand that will mean another thing to plug in, etc. Also, my laptop will be the only one capable of driving the 4K. The other 2-3 computers could be potentially plugged into the widescreen and used in full screen or PBP/PIP as needed.\n\nI assume you're of the opinion of going with the highest density? Better for the eyes? 
Israeli interests are actually US interests. Israel was a Western creation.\n\nPalestine, it seems, is supported by some of our allies in the Middle East (and consequently in Europe). Maybe to keep Israel in check.
Is Adrenochrome r/conspiracy's rhinoceros horn?
Gary Webb was threatened?
You're in
Why couldn't he just say Zionists then? Does saying "Jews" give him more cred in this sub or is he just trying to be inaccurate, making the sub actually look bad. Because the second one is definitely happening.
But then it creates havoc for the general public while smart criminals will simply use encryption tools. Maybe you'll get a bunch of low level criminals who are lazy and without resources. I guess that's what law enforcement wants. A bunch of "victories" without ever solving the problem.\n\nThen you have the whole problem of other nation states wanting the same thing. Li and behold, there are now 70 different versions of iOS and Android with their own backdoors, each of which could be easily mass exploitable with a good spy or two.\n\nAre we trying to create a situation where the only people who are safe are those with massive resources?
This is par for the course for the big data collection companies. 
I couldn't find any info on the existing pipe that also goes under both the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. \n\nIt would be nice if they could also replace the old pipe while they're at it!
Saudi Arabia is an ally. They are not going to get a travel ban.
Not number 1. Overstated.
Who cares. Washington D.C. is like 90% Democrat. Also, it's not necessarily a representative sample.\n\nYes, he's less popular than Obama. Obama was the first Democrat to legitimately win since Carter (Perot elected Clinton). So basically Obama was a phenomenon having won in a Republican country.
Supposedly, it's a custom variant of 7075. 
Also, there are real spies out there trying to infiltrate corporations. Apple is a great target because of its privacy stance.
He also had a distant stance with the common foreign policy themes at the time. Like a direct war with Syria (i.e. boots on the ground). Because it was a dumb idea that was paraded around like common sense.
There are several Human Trafficking related House Resolutions introduced almost immediately after pizzagate. Not sure if this is common. Seems like a strange coincidence.
Seems like the word immediately following the "do" in a question would be most associated to the topic.
Unlikely in my opinion. Wired charging will always be faster and will be necessary in certain situations.\n\nI see wireless charging as a supplement for convenience sake.
Damage of a shareholder revolt? Maybe they keep their cash but the CEO gets removed. Stuff like that. Not saying it would happen, but Apple has shareholders (retirees and the like) depending on it. I don't see the advantage of Apple having $500 billion as opposed to $300 billion. They feasible uses for that cash are slim unless they buy infrastructure, which would be awesome but maybe loses them negotiating leverage.
Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews Jews.\n\nThere? Does that meet this sub's quota for today?

TPP was already out the window before Trump was against it. It's been failing internally and internationally for years. \n\nFBI was already investigating Clinton and company for at least 2 years.\n\nRather than lead some kind of revolution, Trump appears to have been in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnybody on r/conspiracy following the goings on of the DNC?
I'm thinking of George.  
What's the lowball scenario? I'd say if wireless charging could charge my iPhone a single percent per hour, that would be totally worth it. 10 hours = 10% additional battery life on days/nights where I don't get it to a charger.
Both of those guys seemed very anti-encryption though. Almost like they were doing it to get to certain people but without realizing the consequences to everyone else.
If you don't see America as having its own stupid propaganda, you aren't paying attention.
This sub is getting worse and worse in that regard.
What about the other parts? Woman getting a pedicure? Girl carrying stuff down the street?
There is also a huge (paid) crowd that hates the fact that Apple isn't a data collector. Being a privacy advocate in today's world is tantamount to harboring criminals.
Yes, but does it HAVE to be Sessions? Could have selected a hundred other qualified candidates just the same.
This is the way of the world. Pay attention to allies and interests.
What kind of weed is that? Scottsdale
So we are adding additional sanctions to Iran.\n\nSanctions related to Crimea will stay in place.\n\nAnd we decided to scale back our permissive attitude towards Israel.\n\nI have no doubt that all of these are balance of power issues, but I always thought that Palestine was backed by Western-allied powers. What's going on?
I think it's bullshit too. I think McAnn was recruited as an operative as a child and that her parents agreed without realizing she'd be gone. ("They've taken her!")\n\nPeople should keep in mind that power is a larger reason than religion alone. Religion is just the how and not the why. 
The point is that Apple themselves doesn't collect data. However, this is the direction that things are heading. There is probably a requirement for search engines to share all information with government on data that's collected. Many think that DuckDuckGo is compromised even though they may not collect data themselves. Apple has Ben fighting this for a long time, long before FBI kerfuffle, and it seems like it might be a losing battle.\n\n
Yes. And let's not underestimate 14 year olds.
This is disinformation to make this sub look bad. Stop upvoting this BS.
They are an ally. They can do whatever they want.
Agreed. Unless they borrow even more massive amounts, which actually seems likely. (I'm interested to see what they say in regard to their capital return program in April.)\n\nThen they can use the threat of repatriation in negotiations with foreign governments. "If you won't let us invest here, then we'll return our money home and invest there."\n\nI also think they could spend on some huge infrastructure projects. We've already seen rumors that they're interested in replacing AWS with their own solution, produced locally in the US. They've also expanded out their content delivery networks (CDN's), which they make continue.\n\nThere are different possibilities, which gives them options.
I would be interested to hear people's opinions on the House Resolutions pertaining to Human Trafficking that have come out since PG.
I'm confused. The bundle is not on the Mac App Store?\n\nEDIT: "The bundle must be purchased through the Apple Store for Education"
If the rumors are true then the pro models will have more screen space in a smaller form factor. This could be a banner year for iPads, much like when the iPhone 6 was released. A 12.9 inch model in a much smaller chassis would hit the "lightness" requirement you speak of. 
Or just look at George Webb's series on Wikileaks. The web is pretty big.
Still cannot create a conversational context properly 
Most of that cost would be secure transport.
Reagan's accomplishments: being around during the computer revolution, being around during the fall of already imploding USSR.
They should head over to /sirifail. Also, try to be specific about what they think is going on (i.e. dictation formatting issues leading to parsing issues, etc.).
Anybody have a comment on the House Resolutions in Human Trafficking that came out right around PG?
Well, the fund was established in 1999, so probably not Cisco right? Cisco is definitely cozy with agencies, no doubt.
I think he is more pro-surveillance state than he is jobs, which is why the stupid encryption stance. There must be a lot of dumb people at some of our agencies y really have enough bandwidth to take on everything.
IN-Q-TEL has ties to anyone but Apple. Wrong.
In my opinion, this is the biggest news out of Apple this year. "Fake news" is a term that was coined by the mass media early after Trump's election. But let's be clear. There has always been fake news, and people have always led to believe falsehoods as long as it served certain interests. Weapons of Mass Destruction, anyone?\n\nDoes this comment from Cook not have anyone else worried? Ultimately, it's up to individuals to investigate and come to their own conclusions. We can intervene, but at what point does that become censorship or a conspiracy to cover up information that citizens may want to know about their government.
Another aspect of Google collecting data is the intelligence they can gather. Perhaps Google makes investment decisions based on the information it collects at its hubs. How does one enforce insider trading laws? As a government how do you enforce privacy protection laws against Google, when you are dependent on them for certain parts of your security apparatus?
Judaism is the only religion that accepts tribalism? Bullshit. How about Mormonism or Satanism. Hell, even Christianity. Birds of a feather flock together.\n\nAnd what was the point of the original comment anyway? To ironically link to Feynman's point that we should judge people individually rather than ascribe certain characteristics to entire peoples in service of what? Bashing Jewish tribalism? \n\nIf we are talking about why Israel needs to be theocratic, I'd be with you. But instead you're bashing all Jews from everywhere just making this sub and others look bad. Focus your argument. 
A two state solution seems to be unworkable by design. \n\nI do wish Israel would drop the Jewish state business (and change their flag, maybe). Then just incorporate all of Palestine and take charge of the security apparatus.
This fund is also where Apple makes big investments in other companies. I believe this capital arm owns a significant chunk of companies like Netflix (and possibly Tesla). People keep saying that Apple needs to buy these other companies, but sometimes it makes more sense to buy 10% of them than incorporate them into your business model.\n\nIn any case, I think Gruber is vastly underestimating the degree to which big banks were willing to dump Apple over the past few years. Even during their buyback, Apple was cut in half at one point. What would the damage to the stock have been if they had just let it ride? 
If there's a pressure leak, at the very least we're talking about heavy salinization of the river, which will affect water supply systems. This could cost more money than it's worth in the long run.
My guess: the US would certainly be less powerful compared to other countries. \n\nWould we be less prosperous though? Who knows? Maybe not. As Paul Krugman has pointed out (some of his Econ stuff is really good), economics is not a zero-sum game.
Health care is a protectionist industry. It's premium. Too premium. The device approach is probably the short and long term.
It also has some political power to achieve those aims baked in. These companies will get away with tons of mistakes.
Lots of dumbass people who hate to shit on "lefty" ideas even if they are realities that affect your security.\n\nSee the encryption debate. Or the fact that an ice free arctic summer has huge military implications seeing as Russia is right there.
I, and many other Apple fans, have been puzzled by this. People say it's about fake news, but fake news has been an issue for the last 30+ years. The solution is for people to get educated, and Cook talks about that. But it does not seem to be a genuinely workable solution that isn't a generation away. You'd have to educate people on how to verify information. And you'd probably have to eliminate a great deal of the useless information we memorize in Social Studies classes.\n\nWhat's strange about this is the encryption stance that Apple has taken has also pitted them against the deep state. Just look at Apple's roller coaster stock price over the past 10 years, and it's easy to see: big banks fucking hate this company.
Exactly. Why do they need to do M&A when they can just invest in the company. That way they can be more fluid with their investments rather than be stuck with a huge commitment.\n\nAll of these large companies that people keep referring to are public companies that anyone (including Apple) can and do invest in. I would be surprised if Apple didn't already own a couple billion dollars in Netflix, Tesla and the like.
Don't work ONLY for money. Isn't that what he said? That is much better advice on my opinion than do what you love and find work in that area.
How long before George Webb's stuff gets taken down? It's amazing how far and deep this runs. Watching his "Where is Eric Braverman?" series, it seems that pizzagate is but a small fraction of the goings on.
http://macro-ops.com/the-4-horsemen-of-the-global-deleveraging-apocalypse-part-ii-a-neutrino-debt-bomb/\n\nRon Paul never talks about deflation, but it's deflation that's the problem. We most recently had deflation in spite of massive QE and rock bottom interest rates. That means that we just don't have demand. Until we can generate more demand, we'll be at risk of a deflationary cycle, which is arguably worse than an inflationary one.
It's probably their own formula, just like the hardened aluminum on current models.
I'm positive they expressed interest. But that was probably back before Jobs died and Nintendo was less "desperate" than they are now, not that they are now.
Is this to say that you want your hedge product to increase in price at the same rate as inflation (or better). That makes sense.\n\nCommodities that can't be produced as easily even with rising demand should be good hedges, no? Gold seems good except that it's just a chunk of metal that doesn't do much. Don't get me wrong, it's useful, but has the decades pass, it seems like science can find replacements for its industrial applications.
It isn't measured or focused enough, almost like it's designed to push buttons. "The only Western religion that accepts tribalism." Speaking in absolutes like that. Is this really true? You don't think there are subsets of people in other religions that aren't tribalists? \n\n"Now we have elite Jewish people openly talking about...". Conflating a few people at the top with an entire religion. The shills on this sub love to use disinfo-type blanket statements to connect the sub itself to divisive and harmful ideas. The Jews have become the common racist's "whitey". Here you go! Now you have an entire people to blame for generations and generations of inequality! OP's comments are like\n\nFinally, look at Feynman's own quote that was referenced in OP's comment. The irony could not be greater:\n\n"It is the lesson of the last war not to think of people as having special inherited attributes simply because they are born from particular parents but to try to teach these valuable elements to all men because all men can learn, no matter what their race. It is the combination of characteristics of any father and his father plus the learning and ideas and influences of people of all races and backgrounds which make me what I am, good or bad. I appreciate the valuable and the negative elements of my background, but I feel it to be bad taste and an insult to other peoples to call attention in any direct way to that one element in my composition."\n\nFinally, we get to Zionism, which was a Western, 20th century concept of colonizing the Middle East, at first for reasons of religious freedom, but ultimately for military reasons. Israel is the spear in our Middle East security apparatus. Many Israelis are brilliant because their parents were brilliant Europeans who fled.
Israel gets all its money from rich Jews. Got it.
I want to believe this answer. It seems less sinister.
Ding ding. We have a winner. I guess this is why we still want to have an unworkable "two state" solution in Israel as well. So that Qatar and other power in the region can have their foot in the door.
I wonder if by Zionist he means pro-single state, which is what the Trump administration seems to be.
Haha!  Yeah, 180 days seems about right.  It would be hilarious if he doesn't make it to his "first 100 days".
Has anybody ever seen Tony Clifton and Trump in the same room?
Well, if it's in a meme, it *has* to be true!
That's FREAKY!  I was thinking "hmmm, Michael Caine's impersonation of Michael Caine sounds like Dudley Moore", and then he does Dudley Moore.
The question was specifically about discussing sanctions, *not* just speaking with foreign counterparts. \n\nQUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador —\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn’t.\n\nQUESTION: — prior to your — TRUMP: No, I didn’t.\n\nQUESTION: — inauguration.\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn’t.\n\nQUESTION: And then fired him —\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nQUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)\n\nTRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.\n\nI didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way — and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that.\n\nNo, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. OK?
I don't believe that he believes the shit he spews.  He's a contrarian.  No matter your position, he'll take the opposite. When Larry Wilmore pointed out that what Milo was saying about trans people were the same things people said about homosexuals for the last 100 years, he took the position of *well, maybe I am mental!*\n\nYou can't argue with a contrarian like him.
This article has been submitted and deleted several times today.
Or it could be the fact that Milo losing his book deal has nothing to do with US politics.
It's...not a coastal state.  And the elevation is like 4500' above sea level.

NDAs are not enforceable if she were abused in any way.
I'm sure there's a lot of things President Trump likes. But does that make it in the best interest for the country to spend the time, money and resources so Donald can hold a rally just because he likes it?\n\nHow is holding rallies with his supporters going to Make America Great Again?
You've now been banned from The_Donald.
There's a video of a women being knocked down on the sidewalk and when she stood up and started yelling at the police in riot gear, she was arrested.\n\nHow can someone be screaming and spitting at the same time?
I bet he made him eat it.
He said the media was *his* enemy, not the American people's.
"Coffins are cheaper than college."  Simpler punchline.
And gave the Secret Service heart attacks.
She would get a multimillion advance to write a tell-all memoir.
Well...I mean, I don't like the guy.  But you gotta admit that those agents are pretty brave and patriotic men and women.\n\nLike when you watch [video of the Reagan assassination attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X5Xjbnches).  When the shots went off, all the people and police hit the deck...except Agent Tim McCarthy who saw the muzzle flash and turned his body broadside and took a bullet right in the gut.  Everybody else was going off instinct and he was going off training.   Those guys are bad ass!\n\n
So for the next 6 months?
But one of those people is the leader of the free world.  NOT GOOD!

Great news, but it's off-topic for this sub.

It's not an alt-right meme, it was an original Pepe catchphrase that the alt-Reich usurped.  I'm taking it back in an ironic way to make fun of one of their fallen heroes.  SAVE PEPE!

This is the flaw with reality TV shows like The Biggest Loser.  Physical exertion is the least effective method for weight loss.

Don't say "butthurt", it's a micro-aggression towards homosexuals. Reported.
The government is much more than the executive branch.  Trump thinks he can run this country like one of his failed casinos, but as the unanimous decision from the Ninth Circuit has taught him, we have a little thing called check and balances.
Their useful idiot in the Oval Office has become a reckless idiot.

The information is true, the news is fake.
I think the real issue is that "serious discussions" are not really that persuasive to the majority of people. They want sound bites and snarky comments they can repeat and look clever or funny for doing...\n\nHence the Meme war.\n\n\nThat said, there is still a small audience that may take "serious discussions"  seriously, but you still need to find a way to repackage those ideas to better appeal to the masses who have no interest in having those types of challenging debates. This is the true failure of honest and rigorous discourse... it isn't really that persuasive. 
Fuck Milo, this isn't playing tit for tat. You are not only spreading the words of a pedophile, but actively defending them.
I am more disappointed in the people around me who believe it.\n\n\nI can argue and show them information from 1st hand sources until the point they are left in a state of complete cognitive dissonance where they cannot deny the things I have shown them, and they will turn around an hour later and repeat the same stupid shit I JUST SHOWED THEM they were wrong about.\n\n\nIt reminds me of pavlov's dog...

NOTE: this post turned into a tirade about my misadventures of learning music, I hope it helps, but I already wrote too much to not post it now.\n\nI had amassed a TON of music theory that, while VERY interesting and actually simplified my learning more complicated concepts later, did little to actually help me understand playing leads.\n\n\nFirst of all, I went through a early phase of just fiddling with a guitar and figuring out on my own what intervals sounded good and that eventually led me to real scales... I just had no real understanding what they were and lacked the vocabulary to understand how to dig deeper. During this time though, I DID develop my hand eye coordination, muscle memory, and timing. I just relied HEAVILY on tabulator to spoon feed me new rifts and figure out how existing songs were played. Think of the saying "give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day..." That is where I was.\n\n\nI had learned a few scales by this point, but they didn't MEAN anything to me really, beyond being sort of useless tabs that I would practice because people said they were important to get better. It wasn't until I learned some basics about piano that I really understood a) how scales are constructed, b) how they are used to build chords and arpeggios, and c) the relationships between different scales. At this point it seemed like there were ENDLESS variations of scales to learn... until I learned about modes. Suddenly it turned out that I only REALLY need to know like 3-4 different scales and MOST of their modes (but it is more fun to learn ALL of the modes anyways). \n\nFor example,I initially went about learning the natural major and natural minor scales as separate scales. After learning about modes, suddenly I found there was a LOT less to memorize, because the minor scale is just a mode of the major scale (aeolian). Learning the modes and how to shift them to the key I wanted was the REAL trick, and not really that hard of one.\n\nI still like to experiment a bit with different odd scales sometimes, but specifically I tend to use the Blues scale, the Natural scale, and the Harmonic scale, and RARELY I use the melodic. \n\n\nPentatonic (5 note) scales are REALLY nice for soloing because they remove possible semitone transitions, and just sound great jumping from any note to any other note without fear of dissonance. The blues scale is pretty much the same as the pentatonic in that you can just play almost any combination of notes and it sounds great, AND it only adds a single additional (blue) note to the 5 already in the regular pentatonic scale. This should be the next thing you learn after (or during) the normal pentatonic and its modes, since it is only a small change. The only thing about the blues scale is there ARE possible note sequences that can sound dissonant, but they are QUITE rare. You can play guitar for the rest of your life, and some really great musicians have built their entire careers, playing ONLY these two scales.\n\nThe natural scale is probably the SINGLE most important scale to the modern understanding of music, and is a great gateway to better understand music theory in general. That said there are a lot of sequences that can sound dissonant when playing it, since it include the full 7 notes that make a "proper" scale, and isn't as much fun to freestyle solo with. The natural scale is VITAL for playing more classically inspired music, which is my personal appeal to it. It is also the basis of chords, arpeggios, and all of the other scales I use more often (EG, Pentatonic Minor is just Natural Minor without the 2nd and 6th notes). Learning the ins and outs of the natural scale and its relationship to other scales is the point where I ceased to be the man who "ate for a day" and became the man who learned "how to fish" and I have "ate" fun lead riffs ever since... <==(I think that metaphor broke down pretty hard there.)

What about premies who require intensive medical care? I am going to gamble they are considered human.\n\nLets push the line a bit more. Should women be able to opt into early delivery because the baby is viable after 7 months?\n\nNow lets blur the line with a thought experiment. If medical science could sustain and make a baby viable at 2 months of gestation, would it THEN be human?\n\nIs our humanity defined simply by the power of our medical science?\n\nI am not some pro-life advocate or anything, I am not even against abortion. I just don't think that line "human life starts until the mother is no longer needed to physically carry the child" is really something that hold together if you think about a lot of the possibilities that could spiral out from it.

I am going to gamble that you are referring a pick-slide where you grind the side of your guitar pick from the bridge to the neck on the 5th and 6th (wound) strings.\n\nIf I am correct, the best advice I actually have (since I do not do this often myself) if to fiddle with your effects to get the sound you want. Different amounts of Reverb and Delay makes the sound feel bigger, and try it with different amounts of Gain as well. Also test out what effect different active pickups have on the sound.
I keep seeing the same articles with the same themes from the same users... over and over. This one person has a tell on the style they use when arguing.

Well, to say it isn't happening is asserting a negative. You cannot do that without a complete data set, and no one will ever have one.\n\nOn the other hand there IS evidence that it happens (people get arrested for voting multiple times for instance), but I believe your argument is that "as matter of scale, does it effect the outcome of an election?"\n\nI would argue that you cannot really measure the effect it would have on voter turnout, similar to the way you decided it would have no preventative effect on fraud. Both side of this argument have presuppositions about a) the scope of voter fraud, and b) that certain people are incapable of acquiring said ID, thus suppressing their votes.\n\nIf a small step toward prevention could shut down this conversation, I still think it would be worth it. 
Please Sarah, you are starting to embarrass yourself.

I am an independent. I like economic platforms and fence sitting.\n\n\nI tend to vote against the party that has  the most power at any given time. the last political compass poll put me about 2 ticks right of center, and more than 3/4s down on libertarian. Until a year ago, I would have called myself a Libertarian, but they are to ideological for my tastes. I prefer Pragmatism. 
^ This!\nThere are constant "I see the light" type threads there and while some are clearly established reddit users, some also claim to starting new accounts out of not wanting to ruin their standing in one of the many "Ban Happy" subs that are run by mods who wish The Purge wasn't just a movie.\n\nThat said, everything ANYONE says on the internet are just words with next to zero credibility, unless you know the person who said them in real life. I even use my real name and doubt that gives me any credibility as well.\n\nThis is part of why I like chan boards. There is no motivation to ingratiate yourself with the community, because there are no "head pats" for saying popular things and nothing sticks (positive or negative) to anyone outside of a single thread. You can only judge anon by the quality of the content of their posts.
I am a Trump supporter, and it worries me that there is no counter balance to his authority.\n\nI never imagined that this election would be a clean sweep for the republicans. I was primarily trying to damage the current empowered party, but I never really liked either left or right ideologies.\n\nThis means we are now left to COMPLETELY rely on Trump to keep his own party (most of which hate him for his hostile takeover during the primaries) in check.\n\nIf he is either compromised or taken out of the picture, we then have a single party government (with Pence walking lockstep with his good friend Paul Ryan).\n\nAlternatively, if his party doesn't walk lockstep with him, he will not hesitate to eviscerate them publicly. Nothing they ever get to his desk will be signed out of absolute spite, because he hates them as much as the Dems at this point. \n\nThe Dems are the only ones with the freedom to openly criticize Trump, because their resistance is viewed as a badge of honor among their ever-shrinking constituencies. The issue is that they are losing credibility fast as a result of the histrionics performed over the last few years. The majority of the Dems have not been able, or are resistant, to reading the tea leaves that they have lost control of our culture. If they do not get their shit together soon, those criticisms will not only be garbage, no one will listen to them.\n\nNothing has actually happened to make me worry yet (in 6 days), but I feel like we have all our eggs in one basket at this point, and that is sort of unsettling to me. 
fair enough...\n\nI just see a lot of examples of people questioning things being called anti-science as an effort to discredit (or perhaps shame) them out of their line of thinking. It rarely works though, and tends to push both sides of an argument into entrenched positions.\n\n\nUsing your own example, flat earth, for instance. I can say for certain that a flight from Chile to Alaska is longer than a flight from Chile to Australia. If flat earth were true, that would not only be impossible, but I might actually have to fly BY Alaska to get to Australia. If this isn't convincing enough, because I am telling someone who may not have the same experiences I have, I have at least provided them a framework for an experiment they could replicate. This is a far cry from the majority of "consensus" or "authority" arguments I tend to see accompanied when people are accused of being "anti-science". \n\n\nSorry if this long winded tirade wasn't actually directed at you, but it is something I see a lot, and I was surprised when (I thought) I saw it in this sub.

I am honestly not trying to sound absurd, but I am getting the distinct vibe that she wants him.\n\n\nSome people act like that when it happens and the person has little to no interest in them. Think of the young boys on the playground teasing the girls who aren't interested, this is almost exactly how they act.\n\n\nHer male friends literally had to pull her away, and she was reprimanded multiple times for trying to sit on his lap. In spite of that, she kept trying to sit closer and closer to him and spoke in higher tones and started using baby talk. \n\n\nAt the very least she was insulted that guy she found attractive didn't agree with her. If that was a hideous neckbeard, she wouldn't have given him anywhere NEAR that much attention, just said rude things and moved on.
I get that people don't like Geraldo and understand why, but I would rather watch him than Shepard Smith. They let that condescending loser get a whole hour every day, and it is one of the WORST shows I can remember on Fox News.\nEDIT: Grammar. 
It is done for the producer so they can have more flexibility on the end sound.\n\nDepending on how you setup the equipment, this can be done without actually effecting what you are hearing.\n\nThe trick I use is to capture the dry signal either by splitting the signal and sending one of the splits to your signal chain like normal for your own reference and the other for recording, or if you have a nice sound card with little to no latency, just return the signal out from the recording rig into your amp. You can also multi track record both dry and wet with this technique in one go!\n\nA simple production example I have is to blend the dry and wet signals when using a Crybaby on funky sounding riffs. The dry recording has a much clearer attack on picking, and the Wah pedal has the effect I want, I just adjust the levels a bit and boom! Sweet sounding wah effect without losing the clearer picking sound.
Yep, that wasn't intended to seem like it was directed at you...\nMore at the tweet, and my own frustration with the world. :)
I suspect this is just cover for the FBI shutting down their honeypots...\n\n\nI have not seen any third party confirmation of this, but the majority of the early sources I found suspect.\n\n\nYou could read this as they are preparing to act on the information gathered through their honeypot operations. They may also be scaling back on the data collection because they are ready to do a massive clean sweep and want to limit channels of communication, or there may be a change in operations coming from the new administration.  Either that, or I am completely wrong...
I believe you are mistaking me for someone who advocated for a recount. \n\nIf there is one though, I would like centipedes to be involved...\nAnd let Jill pay to organize them, she has plenty of money to burn now! ;)
I am just surprised admins didn't get rid of the pewdiepie response...
> conspiracy types\n\n\nhuh...\n
HOLY CRAP!A Lot... \nI should have archived it before sharing, but meh. That feels like enough of a victory to me!
> dimed metalzone\n\nMY GOD! I will have to try it to know for sure, but that is already sounding pretty insane.\n\nI haven't tried combining a Tubescreamer and a MT-2 before. 
None to my knowledge has been provided, and they aren't allowed to contest until the final results come in later today.\n\nNothing wrong with being proactive though!\n\nMichigan will probably be the hardest sale on a recount because they did two internal counts already and MI uses paper ballots statewide.
LOL, It started with a challenge for my friends to prove he was racist. Everything was circumstantial, and I started supporting him openly as a result.\n\n\nI honestly loved watching him DESTROY republicans(neocons) in the primary debates, and hoped against (what I thought to be) common sense that Trump was a viable candidate. I was iffy after Iowa and all in after New Hampshire. \n\nI backed him initially only because he paid for his own campaign and worked a crowd like I have have never seen a politician do in my life.
That sword cuts both ways, Sarah.\n\n\nYou can claim to be the imperfect messenger against Milo, but he has the same claim on you!
Maybe.\n\nThat on it's own isn't what I find suspect, though. Specifically claiming long term knowledge about this community, when the most generous assessment you can make is that they COULD ONLY have been lurking, is what I suspicious.\n\n\nBigger conspiracies have been built on less.
Whoo boy!\nFor about a month there near the end we were through the looking glass and reality was VERY subjective. I am glad to see we are starting to come back to normal (or the new normal at least.)\n\nNow that you are stuck with him for president for a few years, I hope people start to realize that the majority of the negative things that revolved around him had to do with his antagonistic relationship with the press, who also had their own clear motivations.\n\nI really hope you take a look at some of his more moderate stances on social issues, because I think that was one of the MOST refreshing parts about Trump being a Republican. The old guard conservatives hated him and kept calling him a liberal throughout the primaries. Then when the general election hit, the media called him a hard right extremist. It was clear they were playing on the division in the political audiences and preying on ignorance. \n\nThe rule of thumb is simple... Let him explain himself. Do not rely on editorialized articles that cover his comments, because they are all hyperbole and histrionics. Trump also uses hyperbole (a lot) but when you hear him deliver it himself, it is usually much clearer what he means, or if he is even serious.\n\nMy absolute favorite part about him is when he goes off script and talks to the audience like a real person. It is SO refreshing to hear someone being honest about their thoughts, even if you don't agree, it gives you something to think about in a way that isn't condescending or high-minded and falsely authoritative.
I am confused by all these post shitting on the current state of this sub who have only posted here a couple times, and only over the last month or two. \n\n\nMaybe they are lurkers, but idk...\n\n\nThere are a lot of these lately.
At this point I am about pretty sure OP IS Sarah Nyberg.\n\nAll of these arguments play out exactly like they do with their counter accusations and redirections into semantics arguments.
"non sciency types"\n\n\nI get what you are trying to say, but making presuppositions based on what you believe vs what others who may disagree believe isn't really an enlightened approach to debate. Instead try using THEIR OWN beliefs as a framework to contextualize your arguments, otherwise it is like arguing in different languages. \n\n\nThis is one of my favorite Carl Sagan quotes "One of the great commandments of science is, 'Mistrust arguments from authority.' ... Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong. Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else."\n\nWhat some people frame as being anti-science, others may view as TESTING science. There are no "Authorities" that are unquestionable.
Yeah those were so inorganic they disappeared in a couple weeks... \nI DO know Facebook will ban people who share or post "offensive" memes. That is pretty broadly defined, so the person reviewing the case has the majority of the decision, and considering the cultural climate at Facebook, it all sort of makes sense. There are a lot of popular groups that get removed for wrongthink.
PLEASE STOP with your pedophile apologencia! \n\nI get that you will make excuses for them when it suites your politics, but this is just disgusting!
Well, since the FBI can neither confirm or deny the existence of an investigation as a matter of procedure, It would be pretty hard to KNOW that a case is or isn't ongoing.
Is it 50% human then?\n\nI am NEVER going to advocate anything short of full term pregnancies myself, but this was merely intended as a thought experiment.\n\nAccording to wiki they are actually "viable" at during the 6th month. I am not just making up my own defintion here. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability\n\nThat said, I do not disagree with anything you said there.
I am sure you know that as well.\n\n\nYou pretty much admitted it in the previous 2 threads on this topic you spammed into this sub within the last hour.\n\nAre you sure you wouldn't rather counter accuse me of something? How about change the topic to my wording or word definitions?
Here is Milo's article then, and then research it for yourself if you are actually interested. What I posted was a quick and dirty version based on memory. I was never asking you to trust me.\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/09/11/leading-gamergate-critic-sarah-nyberg-claimed-to-be-a-pedophile-apologised-for-white-nationalism/
reading my comment history?! Why THAT sounds like stalking! \n\nYou can't even redirect properly because you know I am correct.\n\n\nI am sitting on this sub and reading new and rising. I keep seeing the same posts over and over by the same user. I will keep responding to these as long as I see them...
Anything that is made for an adult is good to start with, as long as you enjoy it.\n\nWhen you move over to a "decent" guitar (w/e that means based on your own personal standards) you will be able to appreciate the differences and have a better idea what a "good" guitar means to you.\n\nI have had some guitars that I absolutely loved, that other players (who were far better than me) hated to play, but would be perfectly happy playing a squier. I personally don't prefer them, but played one for years and still own (and love) mine.\n\nEnjoy your new guitar and play it everyday! It can take you as far as you want to take it, and you will know when it is time to get something new. Visit guitar shops and demo different stuff, and get a feel for what you want your next guitar to feel and sound like. There is no rush...
A Tubescreamer...  and a compressor if you aren't using active pickups.
so it is 1:52 pm and the best I can tell is it's his new Stepdads ex. ;)
I said this a few times today but...\n\n\n"Conspiracies" or scandals that are spread through the main stream media is called "News". The fact that MSM is now  synonymous with "Fake News" is their own failures. Posting it here WILL NOT give it any more credibility. (What a backwards timeline we found ourselves in...)
Here is the thing, I fundamentally disagreed with Bernie on this topic, but he DID have an economic platform. That is one of the VERY BASIC requirements to win over middle America. \n\n\nAll I really remember from Hillary's platform was to throw governments money (taxes) at green energy and how that would create employment. So basically doubling down on the same failures that made us noncompetitive under Obama. 
> Jeez that Hannah Arendt passage is exactly how I feel and I'm sure many others.\n\n\nNot to sound rude, but that sounded scripted AF.\n\n\nNothing is different now, aside from the internet keeping track of what the media says from day to day and comparing it over time. They lost credibility on their own.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXc5fn6b9RI
You misunderstand who he means when he says "cabal who owns MSM". Not the shareholders, but the intelligence sources that leak to the big MSM outlets. REAL intelligence is like 80% openly available information mixed with 20% actual secret stuff. Most of that even is just information about their own agents and opposition agents, techniques, and technologies. The amount of GENUINELY secret info intelligence agencies have that is none operational is minuscule. \n\n\nBUT there is a way to make this information EVEN more valuable! That fact IS that the majority of what they DO is in MISINFORMATION. They create stories or spin false narratives about events to control the context with which those events are framed. If you can control that context, you effectively control what those event MEAN. This is where "The cabal who owns the MSM" comes in... They are given these disingenuous stories through their "credible" sources with a greenlight to publish. These are usually the sensational stories of the day. As other intelligence sources "confirm the accuracy" of the story to other MSM outlets, it spreads like wildfire. Just one of these types of stories could make a journalists career, but the journalists that can maintain this relationship WILL become a major media figure. This effectively makes "The cabal who owns the MSM" as the king makers for the media. If the media crosses them, they could not only cut ties, but feed them false stories who's validity will be denied to other outlets, effectively destroy the original publishers reputation (eg. tabloid, fake news, etc...)\n\n\nThis not only creates a firewall between the majority of the public and information they seek, but it also creates a deluge of information that isn't accurate or are even whole cloth fabrications. In this environment, the small amount of REAL secret intelligence and even the info that is publicly available becomes valuable just by knowing the difference between the fictional context and the truth.
The lesson they learned a long time ago was...\n\n\n"If I sit and complain long enough, the grown ups with fix it to shut me up."
That is odd, because I volunteered in good faith.
Yep there are other posts (that may not exist now) where I stated this was in good faith. \nShe earned enough money for the recount, let her organize it. :p
Cool! Arguments about politics and semantics all in the same post!
Your own behavior is what I am reacting to. There is nothing about a reddit account or it's comment history that would validate anything in that regard, that couldn't be intentionally falsified for the purpose of creating anonymity. \n\n\nYour lack of consistency between similarly themed threads and the style and tactics you use are what I am going on, and your own reaction to me asking if you were Sarah Nyberg as well. If for whatever reason you aren't Sarah, you likely spend a lot of time with the person. I might even believe you a BIT if you bothered to directly deny it instead of word sentences in such a way to sound like a denial.
I could be...
Sure a creepy pedo who goes by Sarah Nyberg used to run a website called FFShrine(final fantasy fansite). They would use the game website as a front to attract minors into, let's just settle for, creepy situations.\n\n\nThe site had a IRC chat server where Sarah would say extremely creepy stuff and argue in favor and defend pedophilia openly. Also claimed to BE a pedophile and discussed fantasizing about and touching their underage cousin repetitively. This carried on for years...\n\n\nA few years ago someone dumped the IRC chatlog and because the whole thing was undeniable, they put up this post in an effort to play it all of as an edgy joke (that they played out repeatedly over and over for many years.) I don't know if it was unintentional, but this post actually validates the contents of the chatlog as being authentic in trying to excuse it away as a joke.\n\n\nMilo did an article outing this pedophile, and now people are trying to use the Milo thing from yesterday as a way to bring this back up and pretend like the rest didn't happen. This is essentially an effort at gaslighting.
in addition, it is REALLY easy to get attention and spread a meme using anger inducing tactics, but the memes that have REAL legs are the ones that are intended to be light and humorous. \n\n\nOutrage memes don't have the same lasting appeal as a joke about someones hair, or a person with funny expression on their face. You need to find a way to package complex ideas into quick and funny images with limited text and create a language of hieroglyphs that have immediate meaning to those who see them.  
Lets just talk about Trump 24/7...\n\n\nMy main issue is that "conspiracies" that are championed by the main stream media are usually just called "News". You can post about that in any of the regular news sections of reddit, and most people will upvote it. Doing that here comes off like a misdirected effort to convince a particular segment of people to support and push regular MSM news articles.\n\n\nI do still support Trump, but I will keep my posts on that topic in a sub that actually wants to hear about it.
We are seeing a MAJOR paradigm shift in the way reality is perceived.\nIf you were only a casual observer, you might not have the full context and think that everything has gone insane! Things that were "facts" a year ago are now considered up for debate. Opinions that were considered socially taboo are hastily becoming the norm.\n\n\nIt must seem terrifying to think your grip on what reality is is fleeting. People use a lot of presuppostions in how they frame information, and when others don't make the same presuppositions and end somewhere else, it creates cognitive dissonance.\n\n\nThis dissonance can easily be ridiculed or ignored as "stupid people" in a small dose. Usually this is how things slowly change over time, but what we are seeing is not slow, but a literal FLIP. This leaves those who are not paying attention in the dark and confused. They will keep doubling down on their old views until they exhaust either themselves or the empathy of those around them.\n\n\nI don't know how this ends, because I have never lived through something like this, but I know that a lot of people need to take a break of the "news" genre of entertainment for their own health, or they will give themselves PTST from jumping at all the shadows and racist cartoon frogs. 
I literally turn the channel off and go find something else to do for an hour...
Post is being brigaded from the regular suspects. Top posts on at least 2 anti trump subs are about this thread, that I actually started in good faith.\n\nI would still like to encourage centipedes to participate in the recount...
Then my comment shouldn't bother you. \n\nClearly regular community members SHOULD be able see through what I posted.\n\n\nThat said, I am not the type of person to have faith in something a person says on the internet.
It is a disinformation campaign. SOME of this info is real, and some is not. If there is too much info, and TPTB can steer people's attention by faking interest in certain topics. These topics are usually provided and steered by the media through "intelligence leaks". Look at what is selected as "Scandals" in the media for example. There is ANY number of topics at a given moment that could be considered a scandal when there really isn't anything to the story, meanwhile REAL stuff is being ignored and discredited through back alleys. \n\n\nALWAYS be skeptical of MSM talking points, as they are almost ALWAYS diversions. This applies to ANY outlet as well as ANY political leanings.\n\n\nTry to filter the bias and spin and look at objective info (stats are NOT objective for instance as they are prone to multiple layers of obfuscation, from sample selection, question engineering/ordering, all the way to weighting.) Look at the patterns of when major stories are allowed to become headlines (there is a terrorist attack like every other day in the middle east for instance, but only are made headlines to bury other stories.) When a major "scandal" is broken by the MSM, immediately look for simultaneous or ancillary stories that they may be intended to hide. Always remember the media only reports stories TO you... and never FOR you.
Maybe? Maybe if that is true, it shouldn't bother you that when you are using burner accounts, that it reduces your credibility in saying "5 years".\n\n\nThat is all...
why not go ahead and click that "context" button next to those comments, instead of stopping short of knowing what you are talking about?
I saw Jon Roberts on America's News Room (this morning) already say this story was false. \n\nI can't find an article at foxnews at the moment on it though.

Is this you, Pelar?
I will go ahead and say RIGHT NOW, that I was NOT a regular poster on here until recently. My political objectives were completed with the recent election (a little TOO well), and we now have a responsibility to push back and keep power in check. Until the election I barely even used reddit (I think the entire premise is based around group think), and tended to participate in places like chan boards or voat more often. \n\n\nMy current interests in this sub are more apolitical or historical in nature, though. During the election, I DID see A LOT of account buying, but this did NOT seem like one of the heavily targeted subs.\n\n\nI would gamble it is a LOT harder to buy an account that has a long history in this sub, or that it would actually lend a poster on a board like this one much credibility based on the nature of the community. One of the more important things to do is separate a statement from the person who said it, and review what can be verified. This was why I looked at your history. I will say, You have pretty much stuck to this one board and already have FAR more posts then the majority of other redditors claiming "this sub is dead". 
Wait a minute... Are you actually Sarah Nyberg? This is EXACTLY what she does when backed into a corner.  Counter accuse with zero evidence and then redirects to semantic arguments.\n\n\nI think I get what is going on here...
73% upvote?\n\n\nI am not a long time poster in this sub, but I have noticed a lot of these posters have only posted here in the last month or two and they all seem to claim some knowledge about how things used to be.\n\n\nThis mixed with the HUGE influx of visitors lately is definitely suspect.
> I am a man\n\nPeople don't need to say that if it is actually true.\n\nI will accept that you are an adult aged male though...
on every single issue her stance was "I'm not Donald Trump!"\nThat is about as much that was clear.
I don't need a source, and I don't care if they donated to her.\nTheir motives have been EXTREMELY clear the entire time...\n\nI don't need partisanship explained through ancillary facts.\n\nEDIT: sorry, this isn't meant as an attack. You are correct to ask for proof, if that interests you.
it would work if done with a delay effect...
Stop giving these freaks a platform then!
Nepotism is why. Pure and simple.
"a little bit of dignity"\nLMAO! Tucker is a fucking beast! He lets people hang themselves and laughs at their arguments openly.\nHe never lets people pivot, and even OReilly is a less hostile interview.
I tried to help them cope with their unforeseen loss. I tried to ease their concerns about Trump. I wanted to help explain what actually happened while they call anyone who voted for him every -ist and -phobe in the book. I wanted to help my democrat friends to understand that the editorials and polls they based their opinions on WAS the fake news (they sure as hell weren't true now, were they?)\n\n\nThey put their fingers in their ears and rehearse the same stances that brought them this lose. If they don't catch on soon, I am just going to keep my mouth closed and enjoy doing it to them all over again in 4 years... \n\n\n...just kidding! I will enjoy doing it again in 4 years either way!
NOTE: This is not a call to action! Just enjoy the read...
The travel ban was based on information already gathered and agreed upon by the previous administration and congress. \n\n\nIt was the easiest to justify a ban against, because the states themselves actually harbor or are corrupted by terrorist groups. That isn't to say they are the ONLY countries that SHOULD have been banned, but they are the easiest to move against because of these previously existing findings.\n\n\nThis approach to discredit the move is ironic, really, because it sort of discredits what that previous administration considered a threat, and further begs the question why THEY didn't do anything about it... Let alone the Saudis who they protected from liability caused by their financing 9/11. Considering this is only 3 weeks into this administration, I think the long term behavior will be much more telling about their loyalty with the Saudis.\n\n\nI honestly place the majority of the blame on establishment members of both parties completely missing the mark on this info, rather than the administration who had the forethought to act upon it.
You can look at my history if there is any doubt I am shilling on this topic. I will NEVER support Bill's wife for any position of authority, I have hated her since the mid 90's.\n\n\nThat said there was a SINGLE point during the election that she seemed genuine. She actually called into Bill OReilly during the terror attack in Nice.\nhttp://insider.foxnews.com/2016/07/14/hillary-clinton-phones-oreilly-factor-react-nice-terror-attack\n\n\nLove him or hate him, he did a great job trying to pull her out of her comfort zone and force her to talk about topics outside her campaign talking points. If she spoke like that more often, and held a stronger stance on those types of topics, she might have done better, but her whole campaign was so orchestrated and fake that it just rang hollow to those who weren't already on board.
>But if everyone has an ID card, and there is already very little evidence of voter fraud, what is the point of requiring it for voting?\n\n"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." -Ben Franklin\n\nThe entire point is that is verify's citizenship. This is only a way to prevent outsiders from messing with the actual vote numbers.\nIt doesn't fix a lot of other possible issues though, like people traveling across state lines and voting twice, or mail in ballots for dead people. \n\nWe can split hairs about the prevalence of such activity and the unlikely effect it could have on an election, but when I register to vote, they already send me a registration card. I don't see why it would matter if they sent a voter ID as well/instead.\n\nIf we did this, it would end the majority of accusations surrounding voter fraud. If I didn't have to have this conversation with anyone again, it would be worth it to me.
Honestly, I am fine with this.\n\nI just don't like the moralizing on the topic of "what is a human" from either side really. In fact, I don't REALLY appreciate moralizing in most political topics, as it tends to be a method of poisoning the well by using either emotional appeals or is used as way to try an shut down opposing discussions by painting them "immoral".\n\nI don't really like this topic at all, because I don't feel there is a clear-cut answer either. There are a million anecdotal situations where either side could seem reasonable, and million directions those arguments could be refuted. This topic is historically used to be divisive in political discussions, and arguments for both sides really haven't changed in decades. Having these conversations feel like we are just spinning our wheels and rarely do they go anywhere. I primarily don't like the way it tends to receive some of the most reductive arguments (when it's a human or when is it a human) and how those lines in the sand create our current left/right political false dichotomy on the topic.
Sure you don't! \n\n\n;)
Then do the right thing and delete this post...

Yes. I believe Obama & his sycophants have their finger prints on this, but he would be re-elected in a landslide by the populace.
If they don't use titles like this, how will #16 ever "blow your mind"? Fake news is not your local @11 report, it is none researched clickbait shit like this. Fake news was never ment to report anything, but to draw ad revenues from clicks by the great unwashed. Pizzagate is a product of CRT to discredit anyone dumb enough to believe it. Also for the mods reading this, please take that Kermit the frog looking wack job off the sidebar!
So you can't post here with out being a shill unless your part of the old guard? So basically your the establishment of this sub & no one else is allowed to play? Is this you, John McCain?
But what percentage of that is electrolytes? You know what cows crave?

Wasn't the EPA responsible for that huge waste water spillage from that mine a while back? Something about the EPA ignoring the people from the mining company & breaching a dam, releasing dangerous waste water into a local river? I'm not trying to be a dick or shill, but people who work for the gov't are generally fucking morons who could not hold a real job. I'm not saying "throw the baby out w/ the bath water", but the gov't has a track record of being terrible @ almost everything it tries.
Areosmiths only #1 hit was actually "don't wanna miss a thing" while extremely popular they rarely hit the top 10 in charts.
It's probaly top forty to be consitered a hit, but I think top 10 would carry more weight. I saw this docu on them once & while their music was great (get a grip is still amazing) their songs just seemed to always get released next to a juggernaut & got lost in the shuffle. So a legendary group has as many #1s as Rick Astley...
Cause it was late & fuck spelling.

Forget sanders, forget anyone the "youth" rallies around. It is proven, the youth do not vote in consistent numbers. Sanders would have lost in the general as well (imo). The dems need to quit looking to their few remaining senators & especially the far left & instead focus on new blood, such as mayors & state senators. I don't think that will be the plan, hell they busted a nut to put Pelosi back in charge. 
No! Goddamnit this is serious! John Connor? Fuckin' John Connor! You people don't deserve the "most electrifying man in U.S politics".
Floor still looks good, keep up the good work!
Id say if it's true it is the fact that no one knew who these people were when they died, hell until I read the article I would have sworn Sally Ride died on the challenger. Maybe the shuttle blew, but the crew survived, NASA just said their all dead cut them a huge check & used the countries sympathy to get a huge budget increase.
That's how mom always remembered.
My wife has accepted the fact I would poon her like a retared whale! pretty sure it was mentioned in our vow's....
No, it's trashy. I deal w/ it a good bit. They set up the page & what the Funeral Home to give them a check for the total amount of the go fund me, usually right then. 12-18 months later they want a deal on the head stone, if not out right for free, cause the donated money has been blow through. Kids still in busted ass clothes, but baby momma & birth mother both have their trashy "RIP" tattoo....

Not that this is bad advice, but I feel in this situation it may be too much of a blanket statement. \n\nThe dude was drunk and yes did some very inappropriate things, does he deserve to have his entire life ruined over it and permanent shit on his record when we don't even know if he remembers doing it? A lot of advice in life that people give sounds good when you say it fast or looks good on paper, but when dealing with people you are close to, you have to put yourself in their position and if I was that guy I can tell you that I would be so hurt that the person did not come to me first. \n\nIf he is genuinely sorry and showing that he regrets it and feels awful, AND was truly blacked out, a GOOD friend deserves a chance to explain themselves before irreversibly changing the course of their lives forever. Been down the road a month later you are still going through the court system when in reality you wish you could have just moved on past the whole thing in a much simpler way. Involving the legal system invite this incident to become public knowledge, and honestly some people get more traumatized by that, even more than the original incident. \n\nThis may down votes to hell but I would rather put the thought out into the ether then not say anything at all. If I made a public post such as the one this girl made, I would want as many different angles as possible. \n\nGood luck OP were rooting for ya! Do what's right for YOU, not necessarily what people think you should do.  
LOL well if I'm being honest with myself I'm sure I will obtain it and only be able to endure without going "over the top" SOME of the time. \n\nCuz shit, I think it's pretty easy to argue that there is absolutely no skill in obtaining meth cuz every mother fucking TV show and movie I've ever seen has even the  80+ year old white woman who lives in a yellow 1950s mobile fucking home that still got rabbit ears sticking out the top, hasn't spoke to another human in 20 years and got 27 cats, effortlessly able to score legit meth anywhere anytime. \n\nCocaine connects (like REAL connects with uncut or one pass pure shit)have alot more mystique surrounding the social strata and function of the ladder. To my unfortunate brain washed since birth knowledge base that's been in active recovery for 3 years now.... meth (not 10% or less like can happen with coke) is accessible in great "chemical" shape from CEOs to the poor people society considers pretty much unworthy of any access besides barely surviving. \n\nNow that I finally got through that Adderall binge Reddit rant from hell that we all know about, I have to get back to weekend all over my house aimlessly getting nothing done and texting people epic novels that supposedly are SMS's (8 fucking pages on a GOOD DAY) to get back to so I can wake up tomorrow and try real hard to figure out what I actually accomplished tonight...BUT GOD DAMNIT EVEN THO I KNOW THIS MY BRAIN SAYS THIS GARBAGE IS IMPORTANT LMFAO\n\nI been in this Delirious State all day I cannot wait to go to bed tonight and end this binge before it turns into seeing smoke constantly thinking the house is on fire coupled with the fucking shadow people in the corner of my eye awe hell no I'm too old for that horse shit OK GOODBYE IM HITTING SEND NOW AND THROWING THE PHONE BEHIND THE BED OMG SOMEONE STOP ME NFFIISI 
I know a girl who got pumped on the beach and had to go to the ER for what she called "Sandy Cunt." So idk. 
Lmao so true. \n\nI've learned through experience to not even so much as brush by my cock until I'm ready to dedicate a few hours to wank 5x in a row lmao. It's NEVER "let me whack it real quick". Doesn't exist on amphetamines haha !! \n\nI almost got the doctor to give me 30s yesterday, so next time I'm pretty sure he will 😃. \n\nI had him write me a script for 70mg vyvanse and for those who don't know doses of that, it's the biggest MG they make (I'm one of the few I guess that prefers them and think the entire experience is over all more smooth/less tweaky), but the insurance company was fucking with me and I was not in the mood to go through a month's  worth of prior authorization hell. I am sure some people here can relate to that, especially if you have ever gotten a prescription for suboxone. PRIOR AUTH HELL.  It has to be the most inefficient and ass backwards thing that a person can deal with as far as insurance companies go. ESPECIALLY if you have a typical doctor's office like me who fucks around about sending the fucking shit in to begin with and never followed up with the information the insurance company asks for. UGH 
That made me crack the fuck up. 
"the settings on it are fine"\n\nOmg I almost pissed myself laughing on that one. Truer words have never been spoken. 
They told us that about WEED for fuck sake! That's why we all failed lmfao! We smoked a joint and didn't die or get disowned. After that it was a wrap for DARE. 
Alrighty then 
That even speaking of it will make your family disown you and you'll end up broke under a bridge somewhere.  And that's just for having the nerve to wonder out loud what the shit is. 
That's hell on earth right there. 
Thank you...
It rained last Thursday? RUSSIA HACKED THE ELECTIONS REEE
Doesn't look like you have tried much.  
Wow that's really sad when it's put so bluntly. 
Some dude had a 1000$ worth of heroine in the hood of his car yesterday, so shit crazier things have happened. \n\nAnd I'll one up you, I remember when OC 80'S were 20$ lol
Yes, yes I do. 
Curious myself
I don't think it's so much that they will see you actual past history, it's just that you can rarely if at all ever get a narcotic prescription filled without getting in trouble across the board, especially with insurance company. 
Plug that yogurt in damnit! 
You do know Mariah Carey has written every single song she has ever sung in her entire career except for covers right. Not defending the flop performance but the only agenda she pushes is her own. 
It seems like everybody knows this stuff is common sense except for the fucking government. \n\nWhich I am pretty sure they know all this also, but to actually change the approach would ruin the DEA/CIA'S cartel and stranglehold on the market, and would fuck up big pharmas chokehold on opiates/amphetamines/etc. 
Idk if you like "scary" movies but if you do you absolutely have to check it out. Even though it's a documentary I was running like a bitch from the car to the house for like 3 days straight 😄
Thanks for the link. I had a tutorial to flash it to the regular model bookmarked, but seemed way more complicated than this one 😀
That dude is a piece of fucking human garbage. He's so good at being a fake soulless​ piece of garbage and having it come across as this professional top of the line performance and doing humanity a service...that I actually thought he excelled at being a news anchor, (MANY years ago at this point) before I was 'woke. I'm almost embarrassed to admit he duped me so badly. \n\nAnd worse, he looks like the type that's probably PROUD of his talents and abilities that instead of using to help society, he uses them for tricking the masses and betraying the most foundational unspoken agreement between human beings for $ and whatever other irrelevant (in this context) shit he gets out the deal. \n\nNo Don, that makes you a fucking loser and enemy of humanity. Cock sucker. Sorry guys that just fired me up for some reason.    
We always said "DARE to do drugs". Some of the more dense students really, really thought that and recited that slogan through their twenties. 
Let me be the first to say my 48+ hour awake ass somehow got a top "10" list out of a list that only had 9 bullets, I'm a dumb ass bitch OK lmfao...\n\nI had a racing/passing thought about David Letterman and my "5 second memory retention​" ass snapped back into posting this bullshit and as you see all I retained was something about David Letterman and next thing you know we got the hood r/stim Chinese knock off. It's a true ghetto knock off seeing that it's even one short of a REAL top 10 list 😄I'm going the fuck to bed \n\nMaybe\n 
That'll get 'em to see your side! 
Dude you need to watch "The nightmare". Might not have been just dreaming from what you described...
Yo peeper? 
That's hilarious
Roll my call!! 
Here in PA I can get them 3 days early. I've seen some people with opiates and Adderall get them 5 days early 😮
Where I live you can get fined now just for having a passing thought about tobacco within 500 feet of a school. All the teachers wreaked of cigarettes in my day, wonder how they manage. \n\nOh wait they probably take some socially acceptable psycho active pharmaceutical grade poison *cough I mean substance to cope that's even worse than just smoking the dam cigarette. 
Even that wasn't true otherwise people would run around town playing up the act of it being their first time to smoke crack and wow I'm so naive do you eat it... and just rotate cities for life! 
No one gives a fuck cause it isn't bashing trump. This site has truly gone to hell. 
It's ironic as fuck that every older generation has been saying about the newer one since time began, but for real...This time it really is fucking true but due to it being considered "the way it's always been", people aren't realizing we fucked up an entire generation of people like nothing seen before and rest on the popular laurels, when we should all be in panic mode and trying to at least curve the consequences of them coming into adulthood. 
Well the fact you at least did enough to not be sick for the moment is a good thing. But once the sickness creeps back, I wish you luck in searching the entire house for a second time. \n\nLet us know if and when you find it! Fingers crossed for you that your mom doesn't! 
I just had a PTSD flashback from that shit I feel like I need medication or some shit now. See they straight driving people to drugs! 
Jesus Christ
Fucking triscuits lmfao I'm dying 
In this case I would agree with you, even though right above you I just made a case for why she should not go to the police, that is assuming she didn't think he was a threat to do it again. \n\nIf you feel in your heart this is the kind of thing he does on the regular and we'll do it to somebody else, then fuck yeah I would absolutely go to the police and make a big deal about it. You may be saving another girls sanity in life in the long run by doing so. 
They figured they would just go for the big scary CRACK OMGZ and all critical thinking is out the window. You hear that guys he said CRACK HIDE THE KIDS. 
Either that or they are not in the mood for getting hit with the shrapnel/bomb/etc. The Bushes of ALL of people would be aware of an inside job plot if it were to happen....\n\nLet's see how many people accidentally sleep through their alarm or claim god was looking down on them and the alarm just doesn't go off...JUST like 9/11. The amount of elites and their underlings who pulled that shit when explaining why they weren't at work at the WTC that day is fucking laughable looking back at it now. We're talking DOZENS that we even know of (who knows how many who didn't do interviews)  cause they told it to any media that would listen. Some cute little story that was supposed to be endearing but now looks diabolical and evil. \n\nIf god forbid something DOES go down inauguration day, be on the lookout for "miracle" sleep in's and such.        
Agreed.\n\n I was never able to get a firm grip on GTA 5's layout and put it to memory. I also thought it was a lot more fun when you just kind of knew where you were going without fucking with the map or GPS all the time. Exponentially more immersive. 
Cool idea, thanks for the info! Checking it out now. 
Please tell me your not being serious with this drivel. 
I'll say that if you have the aforementioned disease, then it is your responsibility to not put yourself in situations where you are sleeping in bed next to somebody you should not be sexually touching. I mean at that point you still can't blame anyone but yourself....
Whoops I replied to the wrong person sorry about that. 
God I wish you weren't right. \n\nWhatever it was I was doing yesterday was so trivial I can't even remember now, but I spent so many hours hyper focusing on it that by time I looked up, the fucking sun had gone down and 5+ hours had went by. 😱
God I wish. I don't even do any of the following drugs that I'm about to name, and I could STILL find crack, heroin, Coke with very little trouble...\n\nBut do you think I have ever one time in my entire life on this planet met somebody who had or sold meth? Nope. I am sure I would have switched long ago but it is not even an option for me 😯\n\nSomehow I have never even seen it in real life before! And it's not like I'm some rookie either, I had a raging opiate addiction for half a decade and have been on Suboxone for over 10 years. I'm just trying to use that as an example of how uncanny it is that someone who has been around the block could possibly never come across meth ever. 
>"ohh it doesnt matter what u do u will be dead in a few years anyway"\n\n\n\nAwe, that would end up really beating me down as I got older in life. That's pretty harsh. 
That's probably cause you yourself started getting a little hazy. 
Fucking eh man!\n\nThis will last me a week and a half if I really practice some self-control! When I can work my way up to at least 2X30 XR a day, I can at least get it to the point where I'll only have to go about a week without. \n\nAnd I am totally fine with that since it helped keep the inevitable amphetamine tolerance somewhat at bay. I have enough experience with this particular drug now that I know getting enough to get blessed everyday of the month will eventually lead to zero euphoria. \n\nSad thing is I have never come across anybody in my entire life in my area that has access to crystal meth. With some leg work I am confident I could find literally any other major illicit drug, except the one I really really really would like ...
Nor is there any good reason on why anybody should even fucking want that to begin with. \n\nIf you do not enjoy altering your Consciousness, it shouldn't be up to you to decide that no one in the world should have it either!
LOL. \n\nWhen I am at a sober baseline, I am not the most sexual person in the world, for a males standard anyways. When I am in a relationship I want to have sex a couple times a week, but I am by no means some insatiable sex fiend...\n\nCue the adderall prescription. I tried Adderall for the first time about six months into a relationship. I went from being easygoing about sex, to becoming a person who wanted it every single day and felt so fucking offended when the bf wasn't interested in me. It would rock my fucking world and took it so personal (even though it probably wasn't). \n\nI have also never had much self-esteem or confidence my entire life, but after I started taking this shit, my boyfriend and I would be sitting on the couch and if he rejected me for fooling around, I swear to god I would just start fucking touching myself and getting off on my own dick. It was the weirdest fucking thing ever. We would go up to go to sleep, and as soon as he would start snoring I would just jack off over and over again in the bed almost as a protest. Like if you don't want me, I'll just take care of it my fucking self LOL. \n\nNeedless to say, that relationship didnt last. I kind of realized we didn't have a ton in common to begin with besides sexual attraction, but then added that he is straight edge and I am now operating on a whole other level...That shit was doomed!! \n\nI hope someone is enjoying my addy rants lmao and I'm not just going on and on talking to the wall 😄   
Sexy 
That's some brutal honesty right there 
That's not dating that's hooking up. And yes that has become infinitely easier. 
No, I would not think any of the things you mentioned are OK in such generalizations. \n\nLife isn't black and white no matter how much many of us have been indoctrinated since birth. Nothing or no one is 100% evil or 100% good, their is a million different degrees, exceptions, and special cases of every last thing in life. \n\nI'm trying to just talk about the incident/subject at hand.  \n\nEdit: Grammar
I agree. He looks botoxed to hell and back. \n\nHe would be much sexier if he just aged gracefully. 
Stupid bitch
Also don't underestimate the power of some powerful area of economic leverage to stick it to the man for having the nerve to stand up for themselves in mass. Look what the elite did to their stock market over Brexit. 
Me too.\n\n"BEAT THAT BITCHES ASS THAT'LL SHOW HER. SHE NEEDS A GOOD ASS WHOOP." TROLOLOL
I'm right there with ya! 
The contrast of all that red and black was murder on my eyes. I wanted to smash those license plates. And all the duffel bags. And all the shirts...And cups...Fuck I really hated all that red and black. Such aggressive nasty aura surrounding the thought of DARE after coupling that with the garbage propaganda I was getting sold on whenever that color scheme appeared lmao  
See how good you can still look when you don't start the whack over the top plastic surgery at 25? \n\nHonestly, I miss the times when plastic surgery for aging stars was approached in a way that the public was NOT supposed to even be able to tell you had work done. Now, a lot of the A-list stars, especially the current generation, end up changing their looks (usually for the worse), in an extreme manner with the first big check they receive! Iggy Azalea comes to mind as an example.  
Ty, and I have only been getting my own script for 3 months so I have debated each time if it's too chincey to even bother, but hey I'm proud so fuck it! Idk unlike a lot of people on here it seems, this isn't my first time around the block and don't do what I consider stupid shit and rookie mistakes when trying to get Rx for controlled substances. \n\nI was lucky enough to be to be referred to this doctor by a friend whose judgement I trust completely, and made aware that this doc will readily write narcotic meds...as long as you don't give him a reason not to! AND he's not a complete moron! Lol do you know what I mean? He's the type that prescribes Suboxone, he's OK with you smoking weed regularly and testing positive for it, AND will still prescribe things like Adderall and/or benzos to help with overall mental health. At least as long as you don't act like a junkie about the whole situation and then dealing with him so shit I'll get to where I need to be eventually and never have to pay exorbitant amounts for things I need again!   
The galaxy s3 just got an update...WTF? 
The CNN of Reddit. 
Thanks by the way for that suggestion, I got myself one of those 😀
Up ya ass ho\n\nThat's the one place that even the best scheming junkie on the block who pretends to be your friend can't boost yo shit without u letting it happen. \n\nEven though this one girl I know said her ass is like throwing a hotdog down a hallway so maybe in her case somewhere else might be better. She a booty bandit trollop sheiiit I heard this bitch fisted herself in front of the party on the banister pole at the bottom of the steps. That shit gotta be 9 inches wide. See that bitch be nasty when ya shit so beat people all over the Earth have heard about it (via this internet post). \n\nU know what I'm a call that ho and tell her bout it HAHAHA
Just let me die now Jesus fuck 
Was just about to say that! 
At least your being honest. I am sure lots of people around here feel that way but would never have the balls to say it out loud. 
I do agree that to ever get back to taking your daily dose, AND having it be effective, you taking a break so you can kinda reset your tolerance is something that will be absolutely imperative and you won't be successful without it.  If you just drop down to your daily dose now, you already know it will just be a tease and not effective at all. \n\nA fact of life that many do not know about the nature of amphetamines, is that tolerance to the drug does not work the same as almost every other psychoactive substance out there. Your "tolerance" to getting spun off 5-10 mg for an entire day will NEVER comes back. Most substances can be brought back to a baseline tolerance if you abstain long enough. Amphetamine(Adderall) isn't that cut and dry unfortunately. 😕I only mention that because you will be more successful if you adjust your expectations accordingly from the get go. \n\nThe  good news is you don't "withdrawal" compared to a real detox from something like opiates, BUT the first 4-7 days will be exhausting and you will super tired. Mentally you will not have motivation to even so much as get up to piss, but thankfully NO physical withdrawal symptoms so it's a walk in the park if you have experienced real drug withdrawal. \n\nWhat I would like to add though, and this is purely anecdotal, you could end up being permanently altered in the brain. I know personally, and other people ive crossed paths with in life, we can no longer be driven IN GENERAL across the board in life without amphetamines. Don't matter how many years may go by, seeing the color and beauty in life just isn't possible without mind altering substances. I'm sure it can be done, but the level of commitment and discipline required I'm sure is beyond most people's faith in the universe. 
Fam\n\nIt's just so fucking stupid. 
Right. They were all writing the program from a perspective of having already experienced those things. Making a decent drug education program really shouldn't have been complete rocket science...
Boy what a letdown that was to find out was the biggest crock of shit they sold us to date. \n\nAnd like the weed dealer is just gonna lace ANY AND ALL marijuana with HARD DRUGS that cost more than pot to begin with, and just spread it around being philanthropic. We could only wish! 
Honestly, all I can think about is how unbelievably lucky you are that your NOT falling in love with opiates.\n\nIt's possible your brain's chemical makeup hit the DNA/genetic jackpot and you don't have a pre-disposition like most of the human race to have your life turned up the fuck side down by it, and never fucking being the same again. \n\nShit I would be thankful and quit trying, for real! It already sounds like you know what you're doing and are already too good at doing drugs for your own good as is...lol. 
Boy if that isn't the question of the year ...
Me too lmao or that he went to visit and busted into his stash of confiscated evidence. 
I've never shot anything up personally, but that sure doesn't sound fun 😕
From the sounds of it, it sounds like the friend was shit face drunk and may not even remember it. I am in NO WAY defending his actions whatsoever. BUT... it IS different than the dude doing it stone cold sober and knowingly crossing the line. \n\nI would tell your boyfriend, and if they really are best friends and you guys were shit-faced drunk, the friendship may be able to be salvaged with just a warning IMO, especially if you can obviously tell that he feel super bad about it and doesn't even realize he did it.  I surely would never let him sleep with you guys anymore regardless though. Who knows, maybe that would be enough to help him realize that his drinking is a problem or that he is even doing things blacked out and needs to change his ways. \n\nIdk I guess my point is this doesn't necessarily have to end and somebody losing relationships necessarily. \n\nOP, have you made any moves on this yet? Don't be nervous, if you wait a long time to bring it up, it could make things way worse than they would have been to begin with and you could end up getting blamed. For example, the boyfriend could very easily get upset that you did not tell him right away and start letting his mind wander into thinking maybe you have a thing for him etc. On the other end, the friend who basically molested you may think that since you said nothing that you are okay with it and/or do not remember it and can do it again... In summation, this needs dealt with ASAP in my experience. \n\nGood luck girl and pls let us know how it goes! Random Reddit strangers believe it or not are here for you 😀  \n\nEdit: I see the edit that the perpetrator wasn't inebriated or anything like that. Honestly IMO, it is inexcusable no matter what way you look at it since he obviously had clear malice and intent to do that to her. Fuck him. 
I understand where your coming from. But your not thinking rationally because your in the thick of it, if you were on the outside you would probably say the same thing I am about to now.\n \nYou did nothing wrong, so to feel like your gonna destroy something by speaking up is not clear thinking. The FRIEND caused all the havoc this is going to wreak, not you. So look, if your boyfriend doesn't believe you, then thank God you dodged that bullet cause why would you wanna spend your life with someone who doesn't believe you when it really comes down to it? \n\nOn the other hand, if it destroys their friendship, then so be it! Your boyfriend should not have friends that he considers his "best" yet they finger fuck his girlfriend! That's not a best friend! \n 
Someone over at corporate just took a dump in their pants. 
You should be proud of yourself for sharing your emotions with others like this...that's deep dude only a real man could be this honest with themselves and others. Give yourself some credit, most of these motherfuckers out here are completely unaware as to the stupid shit they do to start, you are obviously smart enough that even though you make the wrong decisions, you do it knowingly even though you know it's wrong vs being a fucking ignorant idiot stumbling through life with the Wind. \n\nI really do not even want to say this because it is so cliche, but the truth is so many of us feel exactly the same way. I would say the majority of hardcore drug users. You have to figure that out X innately have an ability to put on whatever mask they want you to see, so don't ever be fooled into thinking the rest of us aren't in just as much pain man. Your not alone we can relate 100%  
Maybe I missed it but could have swore I ran the manual update in the last week and said no new updates. Are they staggered by any chance? I'll be home soon and check first thing!! 
I never understood why that was not talked about more on here
Well we can't be TOO honest. Big pharma has to struggle to stay in business as we all know like we can't go telling the truth all over town that they took every decent street drug and made a pill form that's socially acceptable. Can't make this shit up if you tried!!
Did the sky EVER look like that with the naked eye? Like 1000's of years ago before we went full tilt with light pollution and all that?  
Seems I'm the only person, at least going off my limited life experiences, that even thinks about how they are breathing when I'm spun the fuck out and becoming conscious of my lungs working. Look guys I don't know how to do yoga, or a dam thing about being at peace with ones self but I believe this concept I'm going to present is rooted in universal accepted wisdom so don't write me off immediately like "nah nigga get outta here with that weak shit"...Hear me out and try this and i challenge anyone to do what I'm about to describe the next time your body is too taxed and would be a good idea to reduce some of the strain next time your on an epic speed run. \n\nAlright so I know it's hard to stay focused on a singular thought for more than 2 sec when we get twisted, but FORCE your brain to  bring your focus to your breathing for 60 seconds. For 60 seconds (or longer), fight with all your current willpower to take long slow breaths. Science and biology does its thing and your entire being will step a few feet back from the abyss. Truth be told, once you get up and start moving again, its only 10-15 minutes before your "Zen" or whatever goes back to being a scrambled hot mess breakfast, but your body will feel better just for having those few minutes of not being tense as fuck. Even though doing that just once helps immediately, if you rinse and repeat the breathing focus I'm talking about, it can be brought under control somewhat and give your heart and organs a few more days to its time on this earth overall. Some of us ain't no spring chickens no more! \n\nEven though we all know the obvious physical consequences amphetamines effect on human beings, but too many people completely forget that your mind over matter is some real shit and realize that simple thoughts can help negate the pressures we put on our systems and contrary to our junkie mentality and justification, we can heal ourselves without having to take some pill or another and modern medical care isn't the end all to be all. \n\nOn that note does anyone understand what I'm trying to say or am I too spun the fuck out myself HAHAHA       
Sure will. Out of curiosity, have you slept since Sunday?😄
Agreed. 
I slept and am back and...YES, feeling amazing again !! 
Yes that is probably one of the best for people still caught in the matrix. \n\nIf you really wanna flip their lid (and yours too) watch September Clues. 
Right! \n\nGoogle is starting to feel like the scenario you are explaining. As a result I barely even use Google news now. 
Did you check the garbage? Can't even tell you how many times I've thrown shit out. Then lose my mind tearing the house apart when really I threw it out cause it was in my hand with actual garbage. 
I know, but still. It's unfortunate. 
Your one lucky son of a bitch
Down voted. spite thread
Easy...  news that is published that hasn't been fuly verified or fact checked 
Because you're a distraction from what matters shill... like kids getting fucked and CIA/NSA openly trying to destabilize the whitehouse
Dude why are you spreading fake news.... really I'm curious about the psyche of someone who does this, the FBI you know.. the group that was wiretapping a civilian and foreigner ... admitted no illegal activity or wrong doing 
Noice the little gem MSN is trying to tack on the end of their definition of fake news " ..intending to deceive" ah yes the great liberal mantra "intent...intent..must prove intent.. for classifi..ugh.. fake news!!
Fully 
There's a difference:\n\n1 is a whistle blower you gave it to Wikileaks \nThe other is a mole in the American government 
What's hilarious about this Russian bs is that it came out today that our own CIA did the same thing they claim Russia did.. CIA influenced frances election...WHERE THE FUCK IS THE OUTRAGE 
I know it sounds crazy .. trust me.. but look into the frogs thing. It genuinely can make sense under curtain conditions 
If he starts going on about how the UFOs are dangerous and we need protection from them, I'll be over it.
Damn they played that to 6th graders?   Rough.  
"There is speculation that Adolf Hitler was affected in his youth."
Stop being a wimp
I've never heard of the Eisenhower camps.  I will investigate and get back to you.  However, if there are mass graves of human corpses all with a single bullet to the back of their head - then I would certainly suspect systematic killing.
Gordon Cooper!  He was a Mercury astronaut, and I believe the last American to go into space alone.  He's featured in the movie "the Right Stuff".  He claims to have seen Foo Fighters during WWII (or in the immediate aftermath).  He also claims to have seen film of a flying saucer LANDING within ~500 yards of the camera that his crew/colleagues took while he worked as a contractor for Lockheed Martin in the 60s.  He says he phoned Project Blue Book, and that the film was taken and he never heard about it again.  Tough to find clearer eyewitness testimony from a more reputable source. You can find his interviews on Youtube.  
You didn't and I didn't mean to, either.  I agree it's haughty to cite my degree, I've just spent too large chunk of my life researching this subject to neglect mentioning it ;)  My hubris.
I'm still debating, and I'm trying to make it a healthy one.  Please do bear in mind - I am not arguing that there is no conspiracy behind how the Holocaust is portrayed or remembered.  I am simply saying that I believe there is enough evidence to conclude that systematic mass killings happened, in which millions of Jews died.  I am still getting to the video, I will watch it and continue our discussion.
What a babe
Well if it was 'scientists' who pinpointed it, aren't they suggesting ways to peer review?\n\n...I didn't actually read the article though
I am so happy that I don't hear voices...
Busy day but I will, and respond.
What is a Seneca boom?
Bigfoot, would you believe it?  
Since we're gabbing; for folks in HS during 9/11, did they wheel out TVs during, for you, too?  I saw the 2nd plane hit live.
How's this, I will watch the video and respond if you give a reponse to my 3 questions:  what about the train tickets, the personal testimonies, and the mass graves?  I'll even go first if you like.  
That's pretty girly handwriting. Bet it would be a fun cup of coffee conversation.
Hey how about this - let's both post our picture to see who is hot and who isn't?  I'd bet good money you are not hot.  PS I made 157,000 dollars last year - how much did you make?
We could debate right now, you and I.
*bait not bate
Your jaw line must cut glass...
Omg of course people are tweeting him that video...*popcorn*
Staged commentary
McCain, with the state of the world can you really blame anyone for not knowing what is the truth, or a lie?  ITS PRETTY FUCKING WIERD OUT 
Why was everyone so handsome back then?
Honestly he sounds like a bad bot...
God flips a coin
Is that Gordon Cooper, third from left?
I think i did it wrong
They were also largely celibate haha, i lurve them.  Named my metal band the Cathars.
The topic of this post is "the Myth of 6 Million" and I'm debating the evidence of this, I think it's perfectly relevant to ask.  I will post more after I watch the video.
And hereI  thought I was alone...
And the children he had by her were enslaved! Fuck thomas jefferson
Remember how everyone ever always says you gotta love yourself before you love others?  Its true
Watch Phil Schneider talk - Bigfoot is mentioned.
It was a violin made of gold - would be worth a fortune.  Idiot.
So what will you do if someone take you up 50 miles in a balloon and you can see the curvature of the Earth?
I am already dead
*yawn*
Black triangles are fuuun, but i found them late.  Try the Belgian ufo wave in the 90s (Belgian jets scrambled and got radar locks) and the Phoenix Lights.
Omg we call our Aussies wigglebutts too.  Bc they dont have tails so...they look like theyre wiggling their butts lol
Holy cow i was at the DC protest in 2002 that those 400 arrests happened.  Obvs i dont care who knows it lol #blackbloc #omgitssocuteweallwearblack #wtf is that dude doing in uniform? \n
Those are incorrect numbers.
Pictures of Yeti footprints, I believe.  Also the ubiquitousness of Yeti stories among disparate cultures.
The title means I have provably spent many hours researching the topic, and writing peer reviewed papers on it.  I am fine with no one paying that any regard - the title does not make me more or less able to understand history than anyone else, but it does mean I investigated.  It also means my investigations and thoughts on the matter were peer reviewed.  However, I concede that this title does not make me an authority.  I simple meant to show that I did more than watch videos and read reddit posts about this subject.  I've looked at the bodies and double checked primary sources.  Has anyone else on this thread read the original, primary source evidence I mentioned?  I admit, they could be faked - but I at least looked at them.  
There is forensic evidence - dead bodies with bullets in the back of their heads, piled into mass graves.  How is that not evidence of mass systematic killings?  
The great barbarian migrations in Europe were key indicators - the Gauls, Goths, Alans and Suebian tribes were all displaced by the advances of the Hun from East in the 5th century.  These tribes were essentially warrior societies with no place to stay, and the Romans were finding restive warriors on their doorstep from Gaul thru Germany all the way to Greece.  \n\nA different angle to think of when wondering why these tribes helped bring about the fall of the Roman Empire is that the average height and weight of the Germanic tribesmen was almost 2inches and 20lbs more than the average Roman citizen.  The Barbarians were literally bigger and stronger.  Just my two cents.  I can leave some source material if you'd like - on a smoke break from work right now.
What else is there in life, but brief escapes from the inevitable entropy we all face.  \n\nMay they grant clemency.
Should've used duct tape!
Has anyone here read "Ordinary Men: the 101st reserve police battalion"?  It's a history and collection of records from one battalion involved in mass executions during WWII.  \n\nOf the ~6 million *purported* victims of the Holocaust, only 2-3 million are believed to have died in concentration camps.  Millions more were killed by large scale firing squads.  \n\nThe battalion focused on in the book was responsible, by their own records, for the execution of 35-50k Russian and Polish Jews and the deportation of a couple hundred thousand.\n\nThis leaves 3 realities which Holocaust deniers must account for:  1. Hundreds of thousands of documented one way trip train tickets to concentration camps (and these tickets - fun fact, made for and by IBM punch card sorting machines - are extant today).  2.  Thousands of documented personal testimonies by German, Hungarian and Romanian special order policemen about the war crimes they committed.  3.  The hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in known and excavated mass graves.  \n\nWe can (and professional historians including me, have) see the primary source evidence that is the train tickets and personal accounts from policemen involved.  I will admit, a massive organization could fake all these.\n\nWhat cannot be faked are the mass graves.\n\nIn Joselaw there are 2,000 dead bodies in mass graves.\n\nIn Stanislaw there are 10,000.\n\nIn Bialystok there are 3,000.\n\nAt Babi Yar there are 30,000.\n\nI could list many more.\n\n\nAnyone can verify this - there are pictures, peer reviewed excavations, and of course, dead bodies.\n\nEven if the Concentration Camps are a myth and no one there died - there a hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in mass graves at known sites throughout Eastern Europe.  I have personally peer reviewed the work that was done to document this fact.\n\nHow can Holocaust deniers (for brevity I include in this camp those who think the number of dead is inflated) account for several hundreds of thousands of dead bodies in mass graves, with German made bullets in their skulls?\n\nIf I had a picture of every individual mass grave and every individual dead body with a Mauser round in it - would the debate end there?  \n\nOr is the organization that hoaxed this event so powerful as to be able to fake corpses on an industrial scale?\n
Zzzzz
I got into a Twitter spat with that lush, was fun.  
What sort of human posts this way?
In the early mid 30s the new German state took out a nationwide census.  This census also included religion in the questions.  Normally, to have waded through all these paper forms to identify lists of only Jewish residents, would have taken a decade.  However, Nazi Germany awarded the contract to take out this census to IBM.  The IBM punch card sorting machines made quick work of sorting out these vast lists, and could seperate the Jewish residents from the non Jewish ones in days, rather than years.  Without IBM's technology and assistance in implementing it, the Holocaust simply could not have happened on such a scale - the Nazis needed technology to accomplish it.  See "IBM and the Holocaust" for further reading.
Whew i was sick and in a bad mod yesterday, thank you for graciously correcting me.  I just hate TJ so much, it clouded ny memory apparently.  My history degree is frowning at me.
I juuuust realized that.  Wowza.  Keeping it old school with the anti-Semitism.
Faux fur and seeds to grow reefer

Doing the ole Nixon lean in
Glad i didnt try it, thanks lol
What percentage of this thread's commenters are Russian born do you think? I think there's been at least one Russian v Russian convo here lol
Capitol* building....I am why UFOlogists aren't taken seriously.  Capitals are cities, capitols are buildings.
No, he didn't.  They were sold off after he died.  
There are issues with the typography and formatting (not consistent with other documents from the same era) which were the death knell for me.  Why they'd bother to write out proof of a conspiracy as opposed to only verbal discussions is beyond me.  
How on Earth he was chosen to be part of the Mercury Program when he'd seen Foo Fighters previously, I will never know.  You'd think seeing UFOs would put you out of the running to be one of the first astronauts.
I've heard many times that Bush "couldn't recall where he was the day of JFKs assassination" but I've dug and dug and cannot find a quote of his where he talks about it.  Anyone know of a link?  
Says the guy who's not hot and doesn't have worthile skills.

Is Virginia still in the lead? I think so.  Man, Virginia js grand.  Checkered history tho.
Your other points are worth discussing, I'll write more in a bit.
Calling two different world leaders 'daddy'?
It's on CNN.
Bravo/a
Something lighthearted bc too much conspiracy theorizing is rough
That was soothing
Bro i have no idea what's going on haha
- prepare for escape - got in
He took credit for bringing to light Podesta and Edgar Allen Mitchell's email exchanges about UFOs.  I reminded him that Mitchell had toured the country for years touting those emails and his conversations with Podesta and that this was not new, and was actually public knowledge.  Then he sneered at me via Tweet and stopped responding.  
...wait you can snort xanax?!

I am a professional salesman, and was told to watch this.  At first I didn't think it'd be useful but...this guy is great.  Being earnest is the first step towards being a great seller.  Worth the watch.\n\nThe best part is when he offers a deal if you buy four...and I think...yeah they would be great gifts, I should buy four.\n\n
Blase
Dang ill have to chat with you about Secureteam then.  Have you tried the Disclosure Project?
Yaaaaaawn
Yup, still in the lead.  Wouldn't have guessed that Ohio was so close behind though.
Let us all stop fighting.
5 bucks says r/conspiracy believes Youtube has an agenda.
Over the side
Secureteam10 are hoaxers at best, disinfo at worst.
Nice thanks for that...Cooper looks way different with a survival beard.  They had the Right Stuff.
...what the honkenwaggle
Omg i just discovered this thread and am stoked.  Ive been a war profiteer my whole career: relish the chance to confer with those in the industry.
Have you heard of Phil Schneider?  Or Dulce Base?
What an awful name for a game
yeah but it will cost you. 
Hmu when you get it,  I know most of the extraction points.  
tell them you are on project fi. lol
Yep if antecedental evidence counts this happened to me.
I agree, I try to live that way as well. 
That's my plan since the G5 is (almost) useless on fi.  
My GT is RE1S.  Feel free to add me.  I play alot of custom games as well as matchmaking. 
this needs to be up higher 
I was just told (literally seconds ago) that it took 7 buisness days after they process the replacement request before they ship.  
Man I'm the opposite.  I can never find enough to read.  To me, having the paitence to find knowledge is a form of mindfulness.  One reason I love this sub so much is for the boundless information everyone is willing to share.  I've gotten almost half a dozen books from here, and countless ebooks just from generosity.  Quite lovely.  
Yep and guess what, you're not the first person to tell me that.   Fuck I did not do my research on LG before buying this phone. 
Checkmate.  3D Chess m8
my 5x died so i'm thinking i'm going to sell the g5 I should be getting and hopefully can purchase the pixel.  
This image is full of subtleties. 
Upgrade and lets party up.  I got the 99$ one and got access instantly.  I need some teamates lol I'm just scaving it up now. 
We haven't.  We know we're the largest consumer of oil (US) globally.   Maybe our addiction to fossil fuels is obvious in my case because I'm studying ecology, but I really think the key to solving our problem is devoloping widespread electric transit. \n\nChina is doing big things with autonomizing factories.  Pushing industry will make the market more appealing to investors. \n\nBefore you know it we'll have cars that are able to drive themselves, made by machines that operate by themselves.  There just has to be a potential for profit before it takes off here.
The age of information brings with it a new type of warfare: 3D chess. 
Wait why are you streaming it, just play it on win 10
I can't wait to record all the times I get reked.  Like last night for instance, I had the balls to loot a dead UNSC untouched, with an AK visible.  I didn't survive.  
Yeah you will be able to get in.  I can't talk about the game because of NDA but there are plenty of vids on youtube and twitch to show you what you'll be getting with the alpha.  
Can I have a job once I graduate next year?\n\nI'm studying renewable energy with a minor in environmental studies. 
You're not alone friend.  My 5x died in october.  Got a faulty one back that bootlooped instantly (wth, did they even test it?).  Sent it back, another month went by and after countless means of getting ahold of them I get an email that I will recieve either a refund or upgrade. \n\nI call them to ask for the refund and they completely deny the email.  The woman I talked to said that they are only giving out LG G4's.  I told them that's unacceptable and she talked to her supervisor.  She came back and said that she can give me a G5 but that is it. \n\nI folded since the G5 is worth more than the 5x I would sell anyway, but it's been 5 days and I heard nothing about the updated RA.  No email confirmation, nothing. \n\nI live chatted today and the gentleman provided me with an updated RA and explained that it takes 7 buisness days (although antecedal reports on here have taken much longer) and that it's still processing.  \n\nI'm only worried because I haven't found a single person that has actually recieved either the G4 or G5 for compensation yet.  It's probable they will send them all out at once, but some sort of confirmation that they will be sticking to their word would be nice.  Anything. 
Titanfall 2 is such a great game.  Awesome too see he worked with it. 
Yep I sent mine back the second time and they recieved it decemeber 5th and it's still just sitting there.  I had it on for about a min. before it crashed :/
Wait you can do this and get all your stuff back?  I've been playing super timid.  
I sent mine in around the beginning of November and still am waiting for a solution.  
just saw :D and saw whats hidden in that bag.  it would be a shame if someone accidentally lost that in a raid hehe. 
I'm using a BLU phone off amazon.  It's not the best, but it's my only option since my phone has been in repair since early november.  
Please do.  Sorry this happened, I really loved my 5x before it bootlooped.  I'm using my sisters 5x atm since I'm on fi and it's pretty much required to use a nexus or pixel.  \n\nI'm going to get a G5 as compensation, my only advice is don't settle for a G4 if that's what they try and give you. 
wait are they srs wiping them tonight?\n
Haha my buddy gave me this game without a case too.  It's the only physical disk I now own.  
Wondering if anyone has gotten theirs yet.  I asked on the 24th for a G5 and they said they could do that but no word on it being shipped yet. 
I'm amazed at the insight our ancestors gathered with such little help, without instruments or many scientific theorys that exist today.  I find many ideas to be quite accurate.  Then again maybe they had more discipline and less distractions.  
Same boat.  Broke in early nov. and they sent me back a broken phone?  How can they get away with this lol
Yeah they did the same thing to me.  Totally renegotiated their offer when I called to accept it.  \n\nIs it possible the phone repairs are another company outside of LG?  I got multiple emails from different companies, both giving the same return number, saying slightly contradicting things.  
would you still have manufacturers warranty if you purchased off swappa.  this whole thing has just left such a sour taste in my mouth I feel like giving up on phones all together.  
yesss more raids haha. 
I just don't think they can get in the alpha forums, and no one can talk because NDA so they spam this sub reddit with negativity.  
I was wondering why the new RA they provided (after calling back, because they never gave me one when i requested upgrade) isn't in the online system.  \n\nAnd here I was thinking I would already have a G5.  
Mind explaining how credit card protection would help?  For future reference.  
I would wait on the 5x untill this all settles down.  That said I'm still using one while my claim is settled so sometimes you have to do what's necessary.  If you're wanting to go the economic route consider the nexus 6 as well. 
I don't understand what they are waiting for.  I'm treating this whole ordeal with caution. 
mine died in october and still no resolve. 
Apples and oranges.  There are geological factors that come into play for both that create energy.  Where I'm from wind energy is extremely popular because it's windy af!  obviously in climates that don't get a lot of overcast photo vocalic cells would be more suitable. 
this is so dumb because it applies to any ignorant person. 
Any suggestion on what service to switch too?  I've been out a working phone for two months. 
I'm not not a millionaire.  
Damn my phone bricked the same day and here I am still waiting for it, while it just sits at LG. 
I've had two bootloop.  And I loved my 5x.  Using my sister's now (because I'm on project fi and must use a nexus or pixel).  \n\nI feel it has to be a large number of phones or else LG would of handled it more professionally.  I've had multiple moments where they contradicted themselves, even going back on emails offering me I've had a refund.  I lost count how many times I was told a date I would have a phone by, still nothing.  Mind you my phone died at the end of October.
I'm in the grey too,  Legacy had such a cool vibe to it.  Even if it had some broken mechanics it was still so fun.  That said I love monolith too, it grew on me.  
haha I wish
Then I definitely need to optimize more.  I turned off hyper threading in my bios recently.  I have to check RAM usage again now that i've done that. 
I can't believe it is acceptible (it happened to me too) that they are sending back broken phones.  What the heck?
When I purchased it, it said they were picking (dice roll) instantly.  I understand why they are only letting people in in waves.   They've been doing stress testing.  All packages come with beta invite.  The game has a way too go, keep that in mind. 
Woah that was deep. 
wait i thought agora was the name of the old map
I just got prepare for escape and am enjoying it.  I got access right away to the alpha.  I figured if I was gonna spend the money, to at least get in.  I would of probably upgraded to EOD if i didn't though I will admit. 
no kidding. 
... this phone needs recalled. 
Has literally anyone even recieved a replacement device yet (g4 or g5)?
Ohh i knew.  I couldn't resist the risk/reward. 
I had titanfall 2 already on PC, but then I folded and bought the 75$ bundle for both of them on xbox.  Seemed like a good deal at the time.  Now I hardly play battlefield (i was so stoked for it) because I have so many other good games.  
whoops! I didn't think of that.  Stream on mate.  
You should still have an (online recipt) of purchase, but they really base the warranty off the imei or serial so you should be good on manufacturers warrant. \n\nSomone please correct me if I'm mistaken as I too am using a nexus 5x from ebay.  \n\nI did have to send one it that was from a third party source. (b+h photo)
I tagged you as man of fortitude.  Thank you for taking the time to not only read my comment, but develope a well thought out response.  It's great sharing pointless shit on the internet, glad you took notice.  
All alpha participants have access to alpha only forums.  There will be wipes every update in alpha/beta so don't get too attached to guns.  I'd love to comment more but I don't want to break NDA.  
nice! thank you, how has coverage been?
No kidding.  How they get away with sending back broken phones is beyond me.  
Did you get an email or check your RA number to find out?
That just comes with college, you're fine.  :)\n\nedit: final year as well. 
Fuck i used to here stories of coon bashing or just going out and killing coyotes for fun.  Sick fucks.  Even had a kitten once that my brother brought in because the neighbor was threating to shoot it.  
Title is misleading, his credit card company refunded.
Make sure you have a backup.  All I can say. 
Yeah i'm just weary because I had an email saying i could get a refund and they flat out denied it.  I had to argue to even get the G5.  
Yes, that is always the first thing I say.  Look at the center piece, that is the color that side will always be.  Unless it's a void cube XD. 
rebirth is means of existence (it doesn't have to even be conscious).  establishing that you experience impermanence aka change.  
yep. 
Yup my 5x died in october and still waiting.  
Haha mine died in Oct. and still nothing. 
What edition is it?  I'm in the US so not familiar with the conversion.  I got the prepare to escape edition and was able to play right away.  However I believe only 75% of the people that purchase it get in the alpha (guaranteed beta access though).  EOD edition will grant access 100%. \n\nI wanted to just take a moment and say if you want to test bugs, and be part of development then it is definitely worth it.  But what you are paying for is not access to the alpha, but a preorder of the game. 
that has to be through huwei or project fi.  I had to deal with LG support, besides there is a much larger price gap.  \nEDIT: looks like it's through a third party insurance company.  
I have 16gb of ram with the 980 Ill run on high/ultra but will turn off SSAA an limit my my fps to 60 just for the time being.  
May my nexus REST IN PEACE.  Enjoy yours while it lasts. 
BUT DRAIN THE SWAMP.  And turn it to a golf coarse that only the elite can attend.  
Have they closed the alpha for pre-orders?  As in if you pre-order now do you still have a chance to get in. 
Growing up catholic, I am extra skeptical of dogma.  And I think it's attributed to growing up questioning everything about the church.  I enjoy the philosophies and ideas that arise from buddhism.  I take the history with a grain of salt, but the practices themselves have provided fruition in my own life. 
I think i'm going to get the pixel once all is resolved, and will definitely be going through google. 
I have the prepare to escape edition and i'm even thinking about upgrading to EOD. 
I mean I just was perturbed when I saw how much ram it was using.  What type of RAM do you have.  I'm ussing DDR3
I have 16gb of ram and i still have to optimize.  My memory is at about 90% usage during gameplay however even at lower settings it looks amazing still. 
Man the rest of the world is smart enough to figure it out.  Here in the US we have the proof in front of us but we still are pulling wool over our eyes.  
damn, you go hard
I was always terrible at chit chat, especially story telling, but boy can I get into some deep discussion.  
Man I'm having a rough time.  I'm laying in bed right now unable to go to class because kratom has taken on hell of a toll on my stomach.  I was getting constant bloating and some vommitting towards the end of 2 month or so binge.   \n\nGranted kratom saved me from a potentially devilish addiction i don't want to get into detail with.  I just wonder how long it will be before my stomach heals.  I quit a week ago, relapsed a few days ago (only a couple grams) and haven't had any sense.  \n\nI do have cannabis Xanax and tramadol on stand by just in case but i cannot wait to feel normal again.
I'm waiting for a phone to be shipped that won't work with my service (G5).  It's most likely going to come when I'm out of state, because they are unreliable with communication.  For such a pleasant experience with the phone, untill it died,  this has been a troubling process. 
I live in a small town so I can't imagine there one being close to me.  Chicago would be the closest I imagine.  Also how accepting are Buddhist sangha's to people from (seeminging) different cultures.  Is anyone accepted or encourage to practice there?\n\nI even have sisters adopted from China, so I understand eastern culture to an extent but always have been timid of that because I am caucasian.  
just got an email today to contact them about a refund.  bout the best outcome at this point. 
They do?? I know nothing about vegetable farms. The only animals I can imagine them killing would be pests or stuff that would eat the crops. 
> 79, 90, 86, 61\n\nAdding Denzel on there made me laugh. Like old man, old man, old man, kinda oldish man.
I get that feeling too. Especially since he's close with Sessions (vehemently anti-drugs) and Christie (also vehemently anti-drugs). Although he's dropped Christie now. I'm pessimistic about the future of marijuana legalization.
Same here. I went to an extremely liberal school in an extremely liberal area of my state. 90% of my professors were conservative. 90% of my peers were conservative. I was also getting a business degree. 
That was my question. How the fuck is he eating cereal out of that thing, it didn't even look big enough for a spoon
So the first HP book you read, not your first book ever? Lol I was very confused by that for a second. "The first book he's ever read, and it isn't even the first in the series??"
/r/altright
Yeah I noticed 2 super tall motherfuckers when they were all walking into their circle thing
Me either. I listened to his interviews with Joe Rogan and he just contradicts himself and admits that he'll hold a position for as long as it will get him attention and money. I'd be surprised if he had any real convictions besides "make money and be known"
My girlfriend kept talking about how she thought William was attractive. I couldn't believe she thought that about a McPoyle.
So basically anyone who posts something about Russia, anti-Trump, or doesn't full believe in Pizzagate? 
Yeah, the post about the Russian leaks was the first, and only post ever, with a tag of "unverified claims". Like, seriously?
God that brings back some terrible memories of trying to get that thing to sound good driving to/from HS... so infuriating
I've kinda thought the same. Allow Trump to run and win, and then use him and the media to divide the populace. The left riots, and Trump uses increased police powers to shut them down (which the right will love). Trump gets removed from power, and the right riots. Use previously increased police power to shut them down (which the left will love). Then put back in an establishment puppet that is "liked" by both sides, and use the increased police powers to shut down any dissent (which will be loved because of how popular the pres is)
Not really a car/jeep person, but just wanted to comment that I really like your house (assuming it's yours), especially the porch
I've been starting to think about this more:    \n*Get Trump elected, a hard line, pro-police candidate.    \n*Have him be divisive, and divide and anger the populace more.    \n*Have Trump expand police powers, which his base will love and his detractors will hate.    \n*Riots start from the left, police use new powers to put them down    \n*Remove Trump, and infuriate the right    \n*The right riots, which is put down with new police powers    \n*Increased government power, increased police power, people much less willing to speak out against gov    \n-THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN LIST FORM BUT I'M A TARD AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT SORRY-    \nEDIT 2- I figured it out
Good, I'm glad you are. But I'd say the majority of his hardcore fans are very pro-police. The_Donald very much so.
>I don't know about you, but I don't automatically assume someone's wealth makes them smarter or better than me in any way.\n\nFloyd Mayweather is a perfect example of this. Dude is a millionaire, but I don't think he could read his way out of a paper bag. Money =/= intelligence.
Milo is nothing but a troll who will do and say anything to get attention and make himself more money. He essentially admitted the fact on Joe Rogan's podcast. His beliefs extend to how much money and attention he can get holding them.
Fuck this is like a reoccurring nightmare I have. I'll be running or doing something, and will suddenly bound into the air exactly like that and then fall to the earth and wake up.
Yeah I added usually onto the end to try and make my statement less concrete and broad lol. Obviously there's outliers, but the majority of those people are not unintelligent in the slightest.
The book is really good, but I prefer the movie (especially the HBO cut with 1 & 2 put together). 
I feel like I'm missing a joke here because it's been a while since I've seen season 4 but I don't remember a different Lindsey
My question would be, why does the CIA want to cause riots in Sweden, and why would they tell Trump about it? Migrants/refugees rioting in Sweden works well for Trump, and the CIA is working against him are they not?
I've noticed that and it bums me out, even as someone who isn't really a car guy. Older cars just looked cooler, and they looked different from each other even at a glance. Now they all just look pretty much the same to me.
Yep. You can bet the police are going to be more militarized and have more power in the next 4 years. Trump is authoritarian, his base loves the police and military. 
I feel the same way. I feel like his campaign started as "fuck it, I'll run and get some attention and make some money" and then got to the point of "holy shit I'm winning, let's see how far I can take this" to "oh fuck, I'm actually going to win. WTF do I do now" to "this fucking sucks"
Can you explain that to me? The massive security hole part? I kinda understand what VPN's are, but my only use with them ever was to use torrents at college. 
Retaliation for Putin having Oleg Erovinkin killed?
Yes, and if you question pizzagate you're labeled a shill. It's gone from being about aliens and actual conspiracies to just anti-Hillary andpro-trump
I've seen the term Patriot Justice Warriors thrown around for right wing SJW's
I've actually started to like his more recent movies more after reading the interview where he basically said he does them for the paycheck and the free vacation. I look at them less like "this isn't funny anymore" and more of "He's getting paid to hang out on a beach with Brooklyn Decker, I'm jealous"
Damn, I've never thought about switching the price tags. Good thing teenage idiot me didn't know that trick
I' never understood that either. Soros apparently always needs more money and power and will do anything for it, but Trump and his cabinet picks don't. Because they're apparently satisfied with their wealth and power, or something.
Do we work at the same hospital? Because our pulmonary staff here is notoriously bitchy lol
Just the thought of getting a PhD in physics makes my brain want to cry
I think I'm feeling what they call the "jungle fever"
Did you listen to his interviews on the JRE podcast? He had 2 I think, and that was the gist I got from them. He contradicted himself through them, and his entire shtick was that he'll say or do whatever it takes to get him money and attention.
What are the housing projects conspiracy theories? Haven't really heard of them before
It's on Patreon, I don't think he's released it to everyone yet
>My day's been made better than my bed!\n\nI've never heard this phrase before, but I'm going to start using it!
Pretty much every work environment I've ever been in has been the same way. Busy days suck, but slow days are absolute HELL
I always forget he's in No Country.\n\nThat's one movie where I can't ever think of the actors, just the characters they played
"mind grapes"
And the whole thing with Johnny Fontaine. I was kinda happy they cut all that out of the movie mostly
I can't stand Trump and think he's going to be a terrible president, but I'm pretty sure the man can read.
I mean, it's very possible both are true. We know the CIA meddles in foreign elections, why is it a stretch to assume Russia does the same?
lol I forgot about that. That and the whole Johnny Fontaine plot in Cali, wasn't a big fan of it but it was cool getting to know the character a little more than in the movie
It's the same thing I hear about:\nISIS (ragtag goat fuckers who we'd destroy in a second if we wanted to - also have infiltrated every state and country and are just waiting for the perfect time to kill everyone)\nObama (ineffective idiot who can't do a single thing right - also turning the country into a muslim socialist paradise and becoming a dictator)\nTrump (idiot loudmouth who couldn't tie his shoes without help - poised himself to become president and then the next emperor of America)\n\nPeople are idiots
What was your cat's name? Cous? CousCous? OtterCat? CousCousOtterCat?
Can someone explain to me what 75% of these words mean? I understood IT, and I kinda know what a VPN is
Question: Does IT get a notice if I go to a blocked site? I'm assuming they do but idk\n
Idk, something about the hats and costumes made me think of Gangs of New York first. The color/filter/whatever is what threw my brain off because I didn't remember it looking like that
I was the same way with TCG. I subscribed and listened to one episode but then put it to the side. I listened to another when I had nothing else and now it's easily one of my favorites.
>Nobody even brings up the fact that you can check all these old CDs out from the library\n\nAnd then put them on iTunes and you have it forever. I have more music on my computer than I could ever fit on my phone/iPod because I would check out like 10 albums a week, give them a listen, and if I liked it I'd put it on my computer
I agree. People always say how him/Hillary/Obama/(insert politician from opposite political party) is an idiot, but you don't get to be that powerful and that high up in government without being incredibly intelligent usually
It amazes me that people can tell that much about cars. I can tell if its a truck, or van, or 4/2 door car. That's about the limit of my car knowledge.
I listened to King of Kings twice and I feel the same way. Not to mention the names. 
And now I want to go home and watch this movie
In college, I dreamed I would have an easy lax job where I could sit on reddit and get paid.\n\nThen I started my job when my boss was on vacation, and I did literally nothing my first 2 weeks. It's absolute hell.
We got ours at Walmart.\n\nI fucking love the smell of Simple Green
Me too! I was so confused when they called the spiky walker Winslow. I was like "I thought his name was abobob"
I've seen that same torture argument all the time. ISIS is barbaric and evil for beheading people and torturing captives. We need to torture captives in order to get back at them! But no, somehow we aren't barbaric or evil for our torture
I've never understood the anti-authoritarian/small-gov people who WORSHIP at the feet of the police and military
Fuck this shit. Do people actually trust the government not to define "Irresponsible" as "Printing things we don't want printed"?. How can anyone who frequents r/conspiracy approve of this?
No I had thought Putin was. Like Oleg Erovinkin, supposedly gave dossier information to Christopher Steele. Putin is pissed that his ties to Trump are leaked out, so he kills Erovinkin in retaliation for talking to Steele. \n\nI recognize some of the other names, but I'm at work so I don't want to spend too much time dicking around on the internet and researching them. That was just the impression I got from the Erovinkin murder. I really have no idea though, just speculating.
Just the President and the government in power trying to discredit any opinion they disagree with, certainly nothing frightening about that... /s
Seriously, r/conspiracy used to be one of my favorite subs because it was fun and kinda ridiculous and everyone hated everyone. Now, it's just anti-Hillary, pro-trump all day and it sucks. You can't even discuss Trump conspiracies there without being called a shill
I hope so, I love leaks. \n\nIt's funny that Trump doesn't love them now that they're leaking against him
My brain couldn't decide if this was Sweeny Todd or Gangs of New York lol. Thank for clearing it up for me
They don't necessarily have to be Russian, I wouldn't think. Anyone who can pass as an American and willing to do it would probably be hired
My understanding was that they're being killed off to remove ties to the blackmailing/to punish the people who leaked the blackmail info
Because Fox is just as much a part of the establishment as CNN, MSNBC, etc.
God that book is so good. I want to read it again
San JuniperoWorld?
The 16-Bit in downtown Cinci is packed every weekend. I tried going Saturday afternoon once and could barely get on the games I wanted
I used to be one of those anti-Hulu zealots, until my gf got a free trial and now I love Hulu. Sure the ads can be annoying (if you're cheap like me and won't pay for the better version) but they aren't that bad. And for everything Hulu has, the commercials are bearable.
Like that Oleg Erovinkin dude
Welp, time to listen to some Warren G
I've been watching them on Hulu, pretty sure they have all the seasons. The ads can be annoying, but the sheer amount of shows and episodes is worth it for me
Reading this was like trying to translate a foreign language to me...
You think people can just calmly sit and discuss the Pepe Silvia conspiracy over COFFEE??
Maybe I'm just completely ignorant about Brazil and S.A. in general, but I didn't expect him to be so... white. 
It used to be one of my favorite subs because it was so crazy and fun. Now it's just trump vs. Hillary, and everyone is a shill.
I can't say that I saw this coming...
Dee is in a costume every other day! In fact, I think we have more costumes in the bar than kegs!
Yeah I feel like I haven't heard it mentioned at all recently, and idk why. 
What is PTFO?
I like thinking about that for all of those high level ultra powerful people. At one time they were shitting in their diaper just like everyone else, they have thoughts and feelings like everyone else, and they're just these human beings who have managed to amass this incredible power and wealth. Human being wise they're just like us, and it kinda fascinates me sometimes.
Oh god... does that mean I'm a McPoyle too? Is it McPoyles all the way down?
And Trump has authoritarian tendencies and his base are hardcore pro-police advocates. Expect more police militarization to come. The police state isn't stopping under Trump
Or maybe he's saying he prefers to eat pizza, but since he's gay he loves dick? Maybe just the simplest explanation?
I just watched that episode last night. My gf couldn't understand why I was laughing so much at him.
Yeah it's ridiculous. I just want to have conversations with people. And be able to actually discuss and debate, not just throw insults and scream at each other.
Damn, I definitely wouldn't have thought the population demographics were like that. That's really interesting\n\nBut then again, my knowledge of Brazil is limited to soccer and the movie City of God so... lol
In my game as medic last night I tried using the rifle grenade over the health pack. It took a long time getting used to it lol. I definitely prefer having the health pack
Woo class of '11 right here too!
I watch Westworld live, and then at about 11:30 Walking Dead is on my go-to streaming site and I watch it without commercials. I'll never go back.
/shrug
Is Trudeau taking American refugees?
Like masturbation to ejaculation? Like, turn on porn, instant erection and subsequent ejaculation in 2 minutes? Not sure that is correct in any way.
Daddy.
We're still missing a connection. \n\nWho gave Flynn the go to speak with Russia re sanctions and why so early? How were they that confident in a Trump nomination and even further into a Trump presidency to effectively promise a lifting of sanctions post- Obama.
For all those making unnecessarily rude comments, you're talking about someone's child. What is wrong with you?
I had a weird dream with your last comment playing out. Congress had a referendum and Obama became the interim president until Nov 2017 for a re-re-election.\n\nAnd then I woke up and was dissapoint.
This matchup makes no sense. Especially with Sager.\n\nHe can't even come close to competing with them and Panchik and Fraser have similar strengths but Fraser is still better than Panchik at his own strengths.
Kids on leashes bother the fuck out of me but I'm kind of okay with this simply cause of cute.
So,  multiply the costs by 3 and the duration by 4.\n\nThis is a gov't project.
Flynn seems to be a pretty good start. He may be the thread that makes this all unravel. 
I guess he doesn't really care about the future of his children and grandchildren.
This your boy, right? No surprise.\n\nThis subs obsession with pedophilia is slowly making sense.
Oh, you think Americans are going to line up to do the difficult and demanding jobs that migrant workers and immigrants do? \n\nYou're kidding yourself. 
The cards are starting to fall.\n\nHow soon before Trump is implicated?
Someone was irrationally defensive. And then he told me he was the least anti-Semitic person I would ever meet. So, there's that.
I thought Again Faster went bankrupt?
How big is dick, though?
This only affirms the notion that Bannon is running the show and Trump knows shit what's going on. Or in Harwal's words, that place is a "shit sandwich".\n\n
And the Dumpsters are still chanting America First, while sitting in a house and on a phone built on globalism...
Looks like most Trump supporters.
Lol
The ironic part is those that are agreeing with him are on Reddit...
The UK is trying to shield the POTUS from reality?\n\nWhy?
This was basically NK's version of Adele's  "Hello?"
This is all whelming.\n\n
Well, this will make him even more erratic and volatile.
And yet, people truly believe Russia has no connection to the current Administration.\n\nTrump has lied.\n\nPence has lied.\n\nFlynn has lied.\n\nConway has lied.\n\nSpicer has lied.\n\nAnd Bannon is being hidden somewhere.
You guys remain on the wrong side of history.
We live in a beautiful world and we're allowing it to die in front of us.
I think it's telling that his advocation of improper relations between adults and children was the tipping point.\n\nNot the disparaging and crude remarks about lesbians, minorities, those of Jewish heritage, etc.
Oh, well would you look at that timing of that.
I'm still waiting for my check from Soros.
Apparently we shipped voters from Mass to NH, which resulted in him losing the NH vote and why Kelly Aydudd wasn't voted in...
You do realize that Obama's growth average factors in the Great Recession?\n\nWhile Trump's numbers are single year projections from a stable economy that was handed to him? \n\nYou should take a moment to figure out how words work.
**Investigators are beginning to corroborate aspects of the Russian dossier.
The mental gymnastics by some Dumpsters in this thread is hilarious.
US White House Officials just confirmed it.\n\nThe only thing that is pathetic is your inability to have more than one neuron fire at a time. You should look into getting that fixed. I hear putting a mobile above your crib will help.
How the fuck are these related?
So, you guys are realizing that he is no diff't than anyone else?
Can we not. \n\nSeriously,  I just want one day. One fucking day. 
How is corroborating the allegations from the M6 British officer not substantial? Do you understand what corroborating means? And how that would make this a pretty big deal? 
This is irresponsible and scary rhetoric.\n\nEssentially, he's telling you that you should only believe what he says...
Oh boy.\n\nThis would explain Kellyanne Conway's complete defeatist demeanor and look of pure anxiety. The ship is sinking.
These robot shills aren't very clever with their usernames, eh.\n\nThey tend to be unresponsive, too.
"And this is the famous white house!"\n\nLike, wut.....
If you're looking for competitive gyms, Amaskoeg and Free are good options. A little more north and I'd check out Everproven or CF Portsmouth.
Before you listened to the answers to your request, you've already spouted rhetoric you heard on Fox News. Are you even familiar with the decision?
But he's the least racist person ever. Ever.\n\nAnd I know it's true because he told me. 
Deploy anti-NK and Kim Jon On propaganda and watch the show? 
Wealth bought her power but not likeability.\n\nWomp womp.
Oh boy...
I do think he is unprofessional, erratic, and volatile. I'm not sure that is the right temperament for a President of one of the most powerful nations on the planet.
And yet those sources were spot on with Flynn.
This isn't a business. The gov't doesn't work like a business and should not run like a business. It isn't a terribly difficult concept to grasp, Bob.
President Bannon wouldnt allow him to overhaul thr NSC.
So, you didn't read the original investigative WaPo article that started this investigation?\n\nOr the confirmation by the House? Or confirmation by his aides? Anything?
The UK went from 0 to 60.\n\nUK citizens less concerned about privacy violations than US citizens, though.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I mean shit, why did we bother fighting against similar store owners who felt it was okay to discriminate against blacks or deem interracial marriage illegal because it was against their religious and moral beliefs. Seriously not that big of a deal. Petty blacks.
I chortled when I shouldn't have. 
You remain willfully ignorant. Welcome to your Trump Club. You're in a good company.
Sadly, tge majority of union members voted in a party that wants to dismantle those same unions. 
I feel like the current state of capitalism will die in my lifetime.
This is freaking adorable.
These make my day.
Not terribly surprised by the racist comments simply because they're Mexicans. The same sentiment wasn't expressed when the UK had anti-Trump protests.\n\nAnd yet,  Trump supporters keep telling me they're not racist. 
It's all fair to white Christians until they are repeatedly affected by religious freedom laws. That'll be a fun time to watch the meltdown. 
He said it was a joke before the connection broke. 
But mah kohl!\n\nI guess the millionaire in waiting Trumpets are going to need to wait a little longer. 
The questioning by reporters and Trump is pretty good indication that something is coming down the line.  Catching a politician in a public lie is an A+ in jounalism 101. They have repeatedly baited him and now it's time to gut the fish. 
The hell happened to this sub?
To be fair, at other town hall meetings, they weren't having a conversation with the people, they were being talked at. Lets be fair, politicians have an agenda that has nothing to do with their constituents wishes and more to do with their donors.\n\nThat's the reality of politics. \n
TIL Trumpsters need to spend some time with a dictionary and a 2nd grade English class to help with their reading comprehension.
I think most in Crossfit/HQ struggle with Fraser becoming the fittest man when they had declared a number of others the heir apparent.\n\nFraser doesn't do much for Crossfit beyond winning. Froning has given back to CF in a way that most haven't, including Graham and continues to be the face.
Russia be fucking with Trump.
I mean, this is literally from the transcript...\n\nDo you even try to read anymore?
Wow, shut the fuck up.
Well, maybe if you understood that this is a different EO, you could sit at the big boy table. 
Especially when they run for the presidency...
Kelly Ann Conway is next.
R/conspiracy is still waiting for their pizza :(
On a semi-related note, I'm kind of surprised Facebook is still a global thing.
This subs obsession with pedophilia is slightly disturbing.\n
They're speaking to the more golden allegations streaming from that dossier.
Given the dialogue I've had with Trump supporters, this sounds about right.\n\nAnd they absolutely refuse to educate themselves.
He'll take the fall and they're hoping this stops the house of cards from falling.
Didn't you hear,  MLK was sponsored by a Nigerian prince.
The misguided patriotism in this thread is a bit ridicilous.\n\n
We're so happy they're finally dead, we can actually celebrate them.
So, Spicer, can we have a follow up?\n\n*“We continue to be disgusted by CNN’s fake news reporting,” he told the news network when contacted about its latest report Friday.*\n\n*CNN said Spicer later called the network back to add to his criticism.*\n\n*“It is about time CNN focused on the success the President has had bringing back jobs, protecting the nation, and strengthening relationships with Japan and other nations,” Spicer said. "The president won the [2016] election because of his vision and message for the nation. This is fake news."*
It was on its way to the moon landing. Detour.
Yaaa, I'm gonna ask that they never allow this man on television again.
Spoken like a true leader of Christ.
Well, hate to break it to you but he took that back a day ago.
Also, it looks like something is about to come out...
How the fuck does that man sleep at night? 
Y'all wanted nationalism in the US. This is the reality of it. 
I thought all those illegals stole your jobs?
People whom I beieve to be fascist do not have a right to speak in public, said Becky the fascist in public....
Actually, I smoke the pipe-tobacco or actual cigarettes, but it is pretty hard and controversial to find those with pineapple flavor. \n\nAnd I heard vaping liquids sell pretty well amongst hipsters, right?
simple workaround. \n\nGoogle account birthdate. If you can figure out how to fake it, and can figure out how to ignore the "click here to proceed", then you are allowed to do this. \n\nPositive side effect? We only get adult people, or people that are smart enough to not invest in dogecoin for profit, but for fun. \n\nIf possible, I would say, right next to the pineapple vapes, it should have medical mariuanna. \n\nBecause while targetting kids is strictly speaking immoral, targetting stoners or hipsters I have no problemn what so ever with. 
Except it turned into a "come on and have a go, if you think you're hard enough" message. \n\nI mean, how criminally retarded are you to use a bomb and go, "surely, if we use a big enough bomb, nobody will ever fuck with us", knowing fully well your own reaction would be "they have a hell of a big bomb, lets have an even bigger bomb"\n\n
simple. \n\nImmigrants are not refugees. 
Very simple. \n\nNobody has a monopoly on terms. \n\nLanguage as it is is an everevolving concept. You want to say trumps support comes from fake news websites? That someone writes articles for trump, because he is paid to do so? That those people write hundreds of articles unchecked? Shit, that is your right. Wanna call it fake news? Sure. \n\nIsn't that exactly the business modell of Huffington Post and the Gawker Media Group? \n\nIf you create a term such as fake news, and write a definition that says, a piece of news that is knowingly fake, then sorry, I will not stop calling out fake news, Just because it is supposedly the main stream media. If I catch CNN running unverified provably fake stories, I will call them what I see them. Fake news. \n\nAnd if you have a "super secret diary", that is "vetted by the secret service", that "has a shocking revelation" that "Illegitimate president" donald trump was in prague and has prostitutes pee on a bed obama slept on, that then in an unforseen turn of events turns out to be the work of the hacker known as 4-chan?..... \n\nShit? DO you accept me to take this on faith? On your good word? On your long list of journalistic integrity that went out the window as soon as election season came? \n\nOr, maybe, just maybe, you know that fake news has a different name when you do it, right? It's called, tabloid journalism. It's called, search engine optimisation. It's called, sponsored content. Its called, oppinion pieces. It's called, not putting the redaction of the previous days hogwash that got you readers in big bad font on the front page to say, sory, we fucked up, but in the fine print of page 11, as a sidenote under the article on tummy tucks of 11 year olds. \n\nMayvbe, just maybe, it has something to do with the fact that american news lost their credibility when in an act of gleichschaltung allmost 7 ogf the big 8 punched the same direction. Because that shit gets you to look closer.\n\nYou want me to get back my good oppinion on newspapers of the big eight? \n\nSimple. \n\nStop seeing online as competition. you don't have to be the first, you don't have to be the last. be thorough, take your time, have a good record. But, if you want to judge online news, be prepared to e judged by the standarts you errect. And if you judge others by standarts you yourself can't pass....\n\nYou were litterally asking for it. 
Hey.... go to south asia, speciffically the myanmar region, and have a look how they interpret buddism.... They do it hardstyle. 
A 10.000 dollar server that people won't take for 3000 dollar....\n\nSounds like the 10.000 dollar bike that people don't wanna pay 3000 dollars for. \n\nOr the tacky leather couch that nobody wants for a "fair" 8000 dollars. \n\nOr, an apple product that is a year old and people don't want to take it off your hand for 50 % what you originally paid for. \n\nGuess what? There are three cases that apply. \n\n1. Product has a resale value of a dead duck . \n\n2. People around you don't need a 3000 $ server-. \n\n3. Server is an off the rack product \n\nThe entire idea of buying a 10.000 dollar server and hoping to resell it with a set profit.... you either have a shop, and can suffer the damage, or you will have the server take up space and help collect dust. 
Simply put. If the Americans quit torturing people, the americans have a right to complain. 
That is why we need an effective hiring stop for female teachers. \n\nJust fill that up with male teachers, right? 
My summer car. \n\nBecause it soothes the part of me that wants to grab an axe, a case of beers, punch out the trucks window and go on a hunt for the policemen. 
Let me just offer a rephrasing. \n\n>~ Both do things the old way and do put much value into tradition\n\nBoth are disgusted that they have a rich and vibrant scene, good nature, lots of stuff going on, but people seem to think they have only one thing, exactly one thing, and that after seeing it for 5 minutes, everybody who comes visiting / vaccations there is an expert. \n\n>~ Both deem respect to children, women, and old folks as the highest virtues\n\nBoth deem respect as the highest value, not because it should be given, or it must be given, but respect because it is the right thing to do, even if the other person has not done anything to demand respect from them. Plus, in the same way they respect others traditions, they tend to demand respect back, wheter it would be the texan defending his ten gallon hat, or the Bavarin defending his Döner habit. \n\n>~ Both think sports are are important and will defend their team to the death!\n\nBoth grow up searching for healthy outlets for national / regional pride. If you want to compare the national sports ( fucking fortyniners), you come up pretty much at the other side, finding equal levels of adherance everywhere. But on a regional level, or even a city / village level, you will find a lot deeper bonding because of the culture of being in a club, a league, or such. You can not compare american football and german soccer. A much better comparison would be to compare german soccer and american blowling teams. For both, their sport is much more an expression of local pride, and of rooting for one of our guys, then a strict adherance to "I liek dem becus they is good"\n\n>~ Both are cultures heavy in agriculture\n\nNeeds to be rephrased. Both states are seen as cultures heavily into agriculture. Perception, capice? While bavaria is inching into a leading spot into high-tech, and texas has much more to offer then cattle driving, it is something that gives us a sense of where we belong, where we come from. So, in both counties, you will find a helpdesk IT guy after hours don his traditional / adopted traditional dress, and go relax in culture. So, while a texan might have a bolo tie with his suit, and might actually wear a ten gallon hat, he will most likely never ever have ridden a horse with the express purpose of driving cattle. Same with a Bavarian who dresses in tracht and takes a walk through the woods, but who never ever knew how to till a field. Look at it like an inner city person sporting gang colors in his suit, like a blue powertie, or keeping his old trademark handshake. Everyone else sees just what they want to see, but nobody asks the people what they actually mean by that. And if they have to explain why they do it this or that way, it looses its charms. \n\n>~ Both are viewed as uneducated, inbred, and unsocialized\n\nRephrasing is not needed. But, an explanation: If being social is being apologetic for your culture, then I have news for you. Call me uncultured. If eing inbred means being a border state that has historically a whole lot of people that come from other countries, hell, lets go, call me inbred. If uneducated means you get to complain that my state has such a long and proud history, and was a kingdom, and then go, but you know scarecly anything about culture, then hell, call me uncultured. \n\n>~ Both have more money in the bank than those making the accusations\n\nI would rephrase this. Both states are unapologetically proud. everyone else can say what they want, can stand on their head and wiggle with their legs in anger, can call me names as often as you like, but the fact remains, at the end of the day, we are proud of our state, and that makes people jealous as fuck. \n\n> Anarchist\n\nI would flat out correct you on this. Go to the rural areas. Go to the alps. You will see the same breed of people there. Proud, to a point of being unapologetic, and closer to true anarchists then any of the fake bitches outside. Even an anarchist can have friendss and family, but consider this: True anarchism means I demand no power over anybody, and in return expect no power over me. If you look in the countryside in bavaria, you will find an unusual number of people who are outright hostile to new people that come in for a quick fling, and then leave. The differentiation between local and "Zugreistoa" (Immigrant) is massive. I would say, both states share one trait: We are content with the people who want to come to us, but in order for your word to have weight, you have to be from here. 
Thanks a bunch..... Can you make it upscalable? I mean, I am seeing it as a new stresstest for my machine. I used to farm dogecoins to see how well the machine handled stress, but I think this could just do it even nerdier. 
Simple. you don't wanna buy from fascists who supported genocide, terrorists, and so forth, try buying non american. 
simple idea. \n\nlets say you do not have the battle prepped, but youn have... like, lets say children. \n\nI usually stat children out like level 1 kobolds, but I don't tell my players. \n\nSo, lets say the stealrth rogue is going through the bellfrey, and he sees himself suddenly in front of two small girls. \n\nIntro the sleepy hollow scene where the girls just break the one thing o firewood. \n\nOne of the best stories of my career as a DM is how to deal with a scouting ahead murder hobo. It was ais a game in which the players have to break into a compound, the entire party is trying to keep stealth, a door opens. \n\nBefore anyone says something, the rogue goes, I wanna shoot the guy in the face. He rolls. He crits. \n\nThe only thing he shot was a 10 year old kid. He and his sister were alone in their flat, their parents coming home later. So, his 8 year old sister sees how her brothers head comes off, and starts screaming her head off, now settled with a trauma for life. And that girl can scream, alerting the entire compound. \n\nThe entire time when it comes to discipline questions, ike noise discipline, trigger discipline, sight discipline, I put in things like that. Maybe it's the family pet. maybe it's a baby. And when I put these out, I do not even have to say anything it is now the inofficial signal that shit is about to hit the fan, and unless the group tones it down, they will be in deep shit. \n\nIt does not even have an XP value, because you should not get that much XP for killing kids, or old people, or noncombattants. \n\nIt just is an inofficial way to let the players know, "you are this close to fucking it up. "\n\nAnd you have not lived as a DM untill your entire party has had a discussion about the death of a 10 year old boy, and ninja assassins / professional murderhobos argue against paladins and clerics that "Well, you kill guys all the time, don't act so holy. "
I am just saying, there are encounters, and there are encounters. \n\nI understand, huuurgh, grr, must kill.....\n\nBut take the scenario from before. You literally have two kobolds, two kids, make them kobold kids if you want, looking out from a door. Just to see how triggerhappy the guy is. \n\nIt is supposed to go that way. That they are easy to kill. \n\nThat is my personal way to deal with problem players. Serve them up the lowest possible characters, literally 1/4th of a challenge rating, but make it heartjarring. Make it ravenloft. a 12 year old girl is not an enemy, if you don't make her one. But if she is standing in the corner, protecting her little brother with a kitchen knife, you have a situation....\n\nTalk her down, and if you fail, she will come at you, and the only way you solve that is to knock her out and pray that you have not crippled her for life. \n\nIt is an encounter solveable by even a level 1 commoner. \n\nBut I have seen level 10 paladins fail misearbly at that. \n\nOr an other example. \n\nThe scouting ahead player sees several kids pelt an other kid with stones. Is that a combat encounter? Is there an XP reward for this? Not even in regular games. But, for the normal shit, you tug the players heartstrings. The paladin will have to intervene. The rogue can look away. But still, it will leave that foul taste in the mouth, no matter what you do. \nAn other favorite of mine is a teenage sorceress that has a problem with self immolation. She has not been officially trained, but one day, when she gets cornered, her skirt will start burning. She has no idea what is happening, the players have no idea what is happening, but suddenly, there is a fire. She thinks the players had stuff to do with it. If the players attack her too forcefully, the local mob will form. If the players do not manage to calm her down, she will die, because she gets hysterical, which intensifies the magical fire effect. The players will literally stand in front of the town, and as they turn around, they are just..... greeted by a sea of faces. These people have just seen one of their ow scream to death, burned by flames, after being pressured by adventures. The proper signal is just..... for the local tavern to put all their gear in front of the doors. Lock the rooms. Not let the players in. Have the aging sherriff there. saying that nobody wants any trouble. Have his wife stay in the background\n\nIt has not got to have an extraordinary combat value. In fact, all my encounters can be driven away quickly. Or rolled over. \n\nBut heroes shine against the darkness within them. There is no nobility in being better then your fellow men. \n\nThere is nobility in being better then you used to be. \n\nThe best thing for future DM's to learn is to have an adventure, and just have humans with commoner and expert in them. Does the adventure still make sense? \n\nYou nver just run the scenario, you allways play against the players behind the characters. Be soft where they are weak, be hard where they are strong. But never ever be easy. The bare minimum should be that if you have a glass cannon, and all the glass cannon does well is deal out massive ammounts of damage, of course the glass cannon is bored if it has to be part of a military battle. \n\nGive the player then something set up to his skill level. give him a challenge... make him sneak up to a fool standing guard. Over difficult terrain. with an orange crate. \n\nThe player wants to stealth? Give him some situation that is hard for him. he is hidden in a bush? Let a guard use that bush to take a leak in. On the player. Let him stay there, laying down, because he knows if he jumps up, his stealth ends. It is easy. The guard is too stumped to give much of a chase. \n\nSome times, the hardest thing to do is do nothing, when your instincts scream at you to do something. \n\nThe best way to challenge your players is to make them have to rethink their approaches. Make them question their methods. \n\nPlayer likes to sneak? OOOh, he can, but several squares are difficult terrain, filled with cheetoe crumbs. meaning he can not take the easy way. Have him take the hard way. have him wait untill a patroll passes, ect. \n\nImagine the frustration a player feels when , the further onwards he sneaks, the more those simple things propp up. A pair of guys stop before his shack, to smoke a cigarette. Talk about married life. He could take them out perfectly. But will he? He has sneak attack, he has two daggers, they do not wear armor..... Will he? Or, will he have the mission come first, and stay, even though that means the party will catch up? \n\nYou know you have the people under controll, and you are an excellent GM, when your players understand that you are soft if you are giving them something to fight. \n\nBecause the real challenge, the real problem, is that whatever you can come up with, whatever the writer of your prewritten little adventure can do, pales in comparison for what the players can do to themself. I guess the best way to describe what makes an excellent DM/GM is to say, a good DM/GM does not create encounters, he creates situations. 
9. Now, attitude. Be yourself. Guys are, no matter what kind of bullshit women tell you, extremely sensitive to female games. you pull games? That means you are showing interest in them. Even if they are harmless games. Be yourself. No games. No deception. Guys are a LOT more forgiving then females when it comes to mking social fauxpas. You will not need games. Games mean you are interrested. Instead, be yourself. Be angry when you are angry, sad when you are sad, happy when you are happy. The guys will show you what is ok and what isn't. Don't break yourself when you make mistakes. Repeat after me. You are the shit. Who's the shit? You are. Be direct, don't demand of them what you demand of women. They can not read minds. Instead, be direct. Brutal honesty works best. Men are relentlessly honest to others, but not cruel and very easy to forgive. The SECOND you start being fake, you are back to square one. Give credit where credit is due, pitty where pitty is due, but don't forget. You are the shit. You may sit there in your eating pants, your ugly ass christmas sweater, your scrunchie that you wanted to throw out, but you are the shit. \n\n10. Now, for a few pointers, don't ask self proclaimed feminists, or womens understanders. You have two choices. One, carpet munching, buzzcut wearing, hardcore butch , pickup driving, flanell wearing lesbians, that have straight male friends. You know, the seriously bad bitches, not the beyoncee wannabes. Not the sjw from across the road. Or, ask little sisters. Both will give you amazing tips on what to do, how to behave. Simply, be adult, direct, and remember, you are the motherfucking shit.\n\n11. There comes a point where you asked yourself, holy shit, is this guy on drugs? I just wanted to play boardgames with the guys. What was all that about? Well, the truth is, there are two ways to deal with this. One, you can ask to be treated like one of the guys. Then, the guide is for you. This is how you get treated like one of the guys. Or, you can come to grips with your own screwed up version of reality, and actually get comfortable with "being the girl". Remember the part about being the shit? This is the ingrained attitude of men, this defines what being a man is all about. They are the shit. If you actually look for a guide, you are not the shit yet. You approach this problem like a woman, trying to figure out the unwritten rules of male society, to play by their rules. To look for acceptance. If you want to see male society, the next time you go to the beach, look for the old guido looking italian in a red speedo. THAT is the essence of maleness. You are the shit, and you have no shits left to give. He knows how he looks. Yet, every morning, he comes out of the bed, looks in the mirror, and thinks how many bitches and whores he can have, while flexing his flabby arms. To him, he is gods gift to the world. He can rock that speedo like nobodys business. Do you think he asks for direction? For a guide? Nope, he has seen what he likes, he goes for it. His friends know how he looks too. And when he tells them how all women are whores except mamma, what do his friends say? They swallow all their commentary (that exists, don't you think for a second it doesnt), and go, bitches be crazy. Because that is what male friends are for. We have been through the same shit, we are the SHIT! \n\nYou are that fat little man in a speedo. You are the shit. You know how you are, how good you look, but you accept, deep down in your heart, that god broke the form after he made you, and the devil fucking cried like a bitch because he is no longer the baddest motherfucker in town. Potbelly, grey hairs, balding headline. The whole package. You need a guide? Fuck a guide. You will still read that guide for pointers, and that is ok. That is man as well. We read cosmo. We read magazines. But do we feel bad about us? No. It is a toolbook in our arsenal. We just got 2 % more awesome. Do the same. Feel free to disregard any point of the guide, if it does not jive with you. After all, you are gods gift to humanity. \n\nAnd now, that I have given you the guide, a word of personal advice. \nMost men would die if they would be treated one day like a girl. They could not take being carried on hand and foot, and would die of joy. We treat girls nice, because from the earliest age on, our mothers told us, girls are something special. And we realize, Girls are special. We treat girls nice because it makes us feel nicer, telling us, for all the horrible shit we do to our fellow men, at least we can be nice to a girl. \n\nWhat you try to wipe out is 20+ years of conditioning. It is possible, but most likely, it will change you. So you have the choice. \n\nEither accept that you were born with a vagina, and deal with it, making the best out of what you got, thereby fullfilling the acceptance of male ego, but not releasing your feminine identity. \n\nOr\n\nTrying to be one of the guys, and risking that you find out that it is not that great as you thought it would be.\n\nBut once you cross that bridge, there is no turning back. \n\nThe choice is yours, only you canb make it. Choose wisely. 
wow... You mean the Russias have started to infiltrate foreign governments, wage wars of agression under lied and faked premises to secure oil reserves, keep black site prisons on foreign soil to speciffically torture prisoners of war in violation of the geneva convention, and raise a system of global spymanship? \n\nPlease, if I have made an error, list me the equivalents of the russians doing the following: \n\n- war on terror. \n\n- bombing hospitals. \n\n- invading countries, instaling puppet regimes, and lying to the UN about the reasons for it. \n\n- guantanamo bay, and CIA blacksite prisons. \n\n- the CIA cyberwarfare program. \n\n- the lawfare operations. \n\n- in general, the decisions of the Bush area, that have not been reversed yet. \n\n- the lets pressure foreign countries into making pro american decisions so we can violate diplomatic immunity. \n\nThe US has worked long and hard for allmost 16 years to become internationally spat upon swine when it comes to foreign diplomacy. To say that they are just as dangerous as russia is an unjustified insult to the russian people and their government, when you do it without proof. Or do you trust people who lied to congress, under oath, that they have correct information, and act within the best interrests of you?
Lets make this simple. \n\nDeclare the agency that hires the mercs with this job description a terrorist entity and ask russia for support. Ask for the financiers to appear in front of the haague to stand trial for crimes against humanity. \n\nSimple as that. 
Okay. lt me be clear. \n\nrelationships are adult things. \n\nFrom the male point of view, beauty is rateable, Hottness is rateable. \n\nThat is what boys go for. \n\nMen go for the extra stuff. \n\nI can freely say that there are women hotter then my GF. But I am with her because I want to be. \n\nNot because her tighs, her tits, her hair.... Those things will fade with age. \n\nI am with her because of these silly things.\n\nPersonality. \n\nHow she makes me feel. \n\nThe way she falls asleep on the couch and I have to draw the blanket over her and she gives the cutest whimper ever, and I fall asleep playing with her hair, because I did not want to wake her up. \n\nThe way she awkwardly hurries to the bathroom, and tries to hide the fact that she has bed hair, or bad breath. \n\nThe way her hand feels in mine, when she is cold, and cuddles up against me. \n\nWhen you chase after boys, yes. Hotness is important. \n\nWhen you chase after men, you will soon find out that hotness does not matter an inch. \n\nAnd when he really moves on after an other... let him go. It was not meant to be, and life is too short to fill it with regret. 
>>But if I hold the arrest of pussy riot against the pictures of Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghreib, I do see a difference. And that worries me.\n\n>Well, that would be a very dishonest comparison to make. Why don't you compare it to political assassinations, killing journalists, engaging in torture of Chechens, carpet-bombing civilians in Syria, etc.\n\nPolitical assassinations: We can 1:1 compare the Clinton campaign death cluster to the Putin death cluster\n\nKilling journalists: We can 1:1 compare the killing of all of those american journalists under mysterious circumstances ( but rest assured the CIA found out that it was totally accidential, but we can not see the evidence) to the killings of those russian journalists ( most likely, the CIA will assure us this was totally planned, even though we still can not see the evidence)\n\nTorture: The torture of the chechens ( single people group, labelled as terrorists, launched major terrorist attacks on russian soil after years of meddling by the russians) is 1:1 comparable to the torture of american prisoners of war that are "suspected" of belonging to al quaida ( single people group, labelled as terrosists, launched major trrorist attacks on american soil after years of meddling by the americans). Of course, in both cases, the evidence about belonging to those terrorist groups is not publically available, and each party asks us to trust their super secret services that totally would never lie to us to commit warcrimes or crimes against humanity. I mean, liuterally, you can show pictures of what a CIA blacksite looks like ( abu greihb) to russian speznatz and they would most likely go, we kind of are over that, but if you are interrested how we treated people from the other side during the cold war, there are museums for this type of shit. \n\nCarpet bombing the civillians in syria by the russians, and the Invasion of georgia / the crim is 1:1 comparable about the bush area isaster invasion of iraq, the bombing of hundreds of civillians, based on evidence that was flimsier then 1 ply toilet paper. I mean, for fucks sake, the americans can not decide that "It is a crime against humanity and against the geneva convention to bomb hospitals" does not mean "unless you are really sure there are those that you deem terrorist inside. " Because you know, you need to protect them ethnic minorities that you really really like. Only ok if it is syrian christians, not ok if it is ukrainian russians. I mean, I do like the irony that an ironic nobel peace prize winner, that essentially got the nobel peace prize for not being george W Bush, turned around and carpet bombed an other nobel peace price winner? And that person has not died from shame, and the nobell peace price committee has not asked for its award back? You can not write this stuff. \n\nWe can even up the scales. \n\nWe can 1:1 equate the behavior of America under Bush, and subsequently under obama, to the behavior under putin. Same shit different side. Oh, and you are a fan of Obama? Like the little foreign policy he allowed to continue? I mean, shit, that turned out to be a debacle . It is allmost as if he, a self described democrat, continued bush area fascist politics unchanged, and instead of dissolving tabu ghreib, and putting the people there under court martial for violating human rights, I don't know, what happened to them? \n\nOh, and if you want to make the argument, "but they were moderate rebells, we just wanted to arm them by breaking international standarts and exporting arms in a war region"..... Lets actually see. Lets see what Isis carries. Who made their cars. Who made their arms. Who produced the bullets they shoot, and where they get all the american dollars from that they pay wages with. Because as far as I can count, you did not have a single country americain foureign policy meddled in that did not have spontaneous linked outbreaks of isis / muslim brotherhood in it. And I would actually be willing to take a bet for 5 bucks on it. That as soon as you take apart the next isis cell, check the weapons. Check the serial numbers of their equipment. Follow the way of the money. and if it just so happens to turn out that you , again, gave weapons to terrorists that you claimed to fight to use them as a convenient excuse to invade the countries down there under the guise of bringing them freedom. And if that is the case, I would heartily suggest you stop pointing fingers at the russians, and start to demand the same sanctions to be placed on the american economy, that are now placed on the russian economy. because if that is true, we have an eerie similarity to the behavior in the ukraine. \n\nBut you won't do that? Right? \n\nComplain that russia contacted your presidential candidate for the right, while your presidential candidate for the left was contacted by china? \n\nI say the same to you that your grandfathers said to the germans a long time ago. \n\nIt does not matter how much you are against him. \n\nIt does not matter how much you protest. \n\nIt does not matter how much you try to wiggle. \n\nYou are responsible, personally, for the actions of your country. But instead of holding out a Morgenthau plan of a club in case you move in a suspicious way, We hold out a hand to you. It's allright. We get you.  Now you know how germany felt past the election of someone whom the rest of the world did not very much agree with, but who promised to make germany have the place on the table. \n\nWe will be there when you finally get the idea that there is only space for one superpower, and that rules only apply to other people not to you, beaten out of your collective head. \n\nWe allways knew, when we saw the cult you have with flags, and that eerily reminded us of our past. \n\nIt will hurt. But you see , germany has been through all of this. So hack all our leaders phones. tell the world we are an axis of evil because we do not want to play crusader with you. We will just stay there, right where we are, and wait for when you realize what the fuck you did. \n\nAnd when the pictures of abu ghreib are in american schoolbooks, and the Bush government is dealt with nuremberg-style, we will see. 
Simple solution: \n\nAllow any actor who devellops bio weapons, or who lets bio weapons escape from labs close to human settlements, to be prosecuted for crimes against humanity, and summarily shot. Plus, in the case where there is a bio weapon release to populated areas, ALL the patents on the counter agents get immediatelly revoked, untill the situation is contained. \n\n\n\nBecause you can tell me if you want, that it is secure, and neccesary, but if the US is producing this, I am more afraid of the US fucking things up by "accidentially" releasing a bioweapon, and going, oops, it destroyed 90 % of the country where we released it, but don't worry you guys, we totally got this. \n\nYou wanna play ball? Financially ruin a company or a state if the bioweapon disappears from their property, then take out the CEO's and the workers in the facility and shoot them under charges of war crimes. If you wanna devellop counteragents to bioweapons, you should be forced to keep that shit safe, nd should be financially held accountable for ALL CLEANUP COSTS if that shit escapes your facility. 
Thank you for sharing intellect.  I was looking for this question. Have an upvote
In my oppinion: \n\nPolitically: \n\n"You elected him president, now support him. "\n\n"He is representative of all americans. You can clearly see it. "\n\n"No, it's actuially torture, a warcrime, and those definitions can be looked up. "\n\n"What do you mean you redefined these words, and expect others to follow that definition?"\n\nEconomically:\n\n"What's a pickup / buick?"\n\n"Why would we ever want to import this?"\n\n"Oh, you collect made in the USA? What a coincidence, me too. So rare to find something...."\n\nculturally: \n\n"I kno, the cardashians, right?"\n\n*Anything about bande desinnee or the ecole belge*\n\n"There is actually a difference between a refugee and an immigrant, but pleasem, don't let that stop you"\n\n"There is enough room for superpowers. plural"\n\nMusically: \n\n"I love justin bieber.

Nope.... I did leave bruises though... I did not think it was possible, but apparently, I had unusually strong grip. 
Which Nazi BS?
The entire idea was to give the budding master locksmih something to do. \n\nIf you were a master, you were supposed to open your own shop, get your own crew, rent your own house. That meant a lot of money had to be there. \n\nSo, usually, the master piece was used as a way to get your thoughs together. \n\nYour former master got a few more months of work out of you, at a very good rate. \n\nYou got the chance to build a little bit more of a polster, and get a few more coins, withoutr havingf the added responsibility of your own shop. \n\nThink of it as the time in university, when you got your dissertation ready. I mean, ready ahead of schedule, so you have your things all done, your prospects lined up.....\n\nYou party like its 1990, you throw some money in the wind, yiou have a good time, and your masterpiece is the last thing you do before you officially become an adult. you are supposed to take your time, use all that you have learned, but in reality, more often then not, it's a chance for you to get rascally drunk and have a fucking good time, and your master to take it a bit easier on you. Both you and your master know what's up, you know that you could just finish it tomorrow, he knows that he has taught you completely, so you take it easy on each other, and have a good time. 
Silicon valley, US: Police protest country wide against "Piggy", the newest app poised to take the smartphone download charts by storm. \n\nThe princiuple is simple. Instead of, like its big cousin, having all in one solutions, Piggy works in a cloud. \n\nA mass off piggy users works as a decentralised mess, sharing data with each other. The second there is military riot police, the piggy app starts to digitalise, and recut the footage, and upload it to the nation wide servers, where the faces of the participating poliuce officers are, helped along by an army of volunteers, identified, and named. \n\nIf the App detects policemen with use of force complains, excessive anger amanagement issues, or known steroid abusers that have avoided being purged from the payroll, all piggy users in the vicinity get a message warning them of this cop. In case of an incident by said cop, video of the incident will decentralisedly be saved by the cloud of piggy users, to avoid confiscation of equipment, and will, fgor free, be hosted on Piggys "pigs gone wild" page, untill the cop stands trial in court. \n\nCritics and police unions have pointed out that this places individual officers too much at risk, and would make paid informers / undercover officers useless, yet could not be reached for comment. A Piggy lawyer: \n\n"They did not complain when their body cameras allowed facial recognition of innocents. We are simply levelling the playing field. If a cop has not done anything, he has nothing to be afraid about. "\n\nThe app features an automatic alert function. If it detects the user is in distress by a mixture of vital sign data / the help button being pressed, it sends out the oink signal, alerting all nearby piggy users with a precise location of the poitential victim of police violence. 
I have lived through enough DM's that burned out because they have never learned how to deal with troublesome players. \n\nI mean, playing in your society is all well and good, if you have learned the basics. \n\nI would not even have spoken up if it wasn't for the fact that the player did not seem to know the basics of conflict resolution. \n\nPlus, it can make for very interresting roleplay if the review cmes up, and the player that accidentially shot the kid has to explain what exactly happened, and why it happened. And he has to get his party to lie for him. 
 Shit, the problem is, this is not catchy, and takes no sides. \n\nYea, it sucks it had to happen, but what can you do? \n\nI simply advocate for one thing only. \n\nApply the existing laws. \n\nThe logic chain holds. \n\n"Did you have sex ed courses? Do you, commonly speaking, know how babies are made?"\n\n"Do you know what happens during pregnancies? "\n\n"So you were aware that you doing this could lead to a termination of the pregnancy? "\n\n"So, you will fully took the possibility that your actions could endanger the pregnancy of The woman? "\n\n"So you fully knowledgeable about the possible consequences of your actions, decided to take actions that could very likely result in the termination of a pregnancy? Do you posess a medical license? Have you trained to become an EMT? "\n\n"So you took those actions, which mirror a welldocumented way of aborting a pregnancy, without having had any medical training at all? "\n\n"Would you, personally speaking, go to a friend who does no have a medical license, to "fix a problem with your penis"?"\n\nNo further questions needed. \n\nWorks even for people that do it while on the job. \n\nThen, let a medical ethics board decide, vbecause anyone who practices medicine has a virtual medicinal license. \n\nIf the medical ethics board decides the procedure has been performed up to medical standarts, and was safe for the person, hell, let him off lighter. \n\nIf the Board decides the training was insufficient, let him of with "performed a medical procedure without a valid license. "\n\nIf the board decides it was dangerous, he did not hve a medical licesnse, and it was an abortion, slam him for performing an illegal abortion, including all the fines and punsihments. \n\nI would not even shrink back from slamming a cop who dies the same for performing a medical procedure while on the job without a license. \n\nMinimum punishment: as with having performed medicine without a license, plus as an addition, has to finish the qualification to perform a medical abortion, at his own cost. Otherwise, its 20 years jail, and a mark as a sex offender.

...\n\nIs anyone fucking wondering? \n\nI mean, shit..... I can already see it. \n\n"Mohinder?"\n\n"Ya?"\n\n"Could you please breath in, so I can get to the release hatch? "\n\n"Okeeh.

simple plan to remove those, if they are placed in international waters. \n\n1. Sell me the drilling platform for a pound. \n\n2. I will bring a pirate radio station on there. \n\n3. I will open the back room up to house servers upon servers of everything good and illegal. \n\n4. I will work with jackhammers and structural engineers to rig up a saltwarer based cooling system, and embedd the server blades in the platforms legs. \n\n5. I will rent the rest of the platform out to gun enthusiasts provided they donnate to the safety vault, either ammo or weapons. I will also put rubber and air based things on then edges. \n\n6. I will declare myself king of the oil platform, and more pretty then queen mum. \n\n7. Within a week they will not only have found a way to remove me, but also a way to remove the platform, just to be safe. 
I see. \n\nProject Shareblue, I presume? \n\nComplaining other countries have roles in your election without paying you the customary bribes? Doing your job without asking for pay? What?

Oh, you are against trade protectionism, and have merged with the remnants of the legalized ministry of truth branch "CTR?" that seeks to define "fake news" as anything that is not state sponsored propaganda? \n\nWell, I'll just put you down as a hypocrite then, if that's allright with you.

....\n\nDoes France care for a second about american elites? \n\nI mean, what was that? Was there something with freedom? Freedom whoppers? Did you try toi rename some form of burger as france refused to participate in a war of aggression and refused to participate in warcrimes against humanity? \n\nOh, what did you say? That was so long ago.....\n\nNo, I am quite certain, it was that you tried to rename the french frie freedom frie, and you cussed them out for not towing the line something fierce. \n\nSo, when europeans don't like a leader who is literally an asshole who commits crimes against humanity on a nuremberg level, introduces torture against prisoners of war, and untill now has failed to show the WMD's, You defend this leader, shield him from anything, and implement the haague invasion doctrine, guaranteeing there will never be justice. \n\nOH, but when we have a president who is barely a full month in office, and who is harassed worse then bush ever was, THEN it is supposed to be all, grrrr, you are not a legitimate american president? You can afford to do this when you are an american citizen , not when you are a world leader.

 > why Trump won.\n\n > Sexism?\n\nNo.  This is not why he won.  He won because he was competing against an unelectable murderer.  He also won because he acquired the necessary amount of Electoral Votes to win.  The other candidate, uh, well... didn't get enough votes.  
This is totally true.  \n\nAmerica has went to war under the guise of lies written as truths since its inception.
Dear wintermute (love the nick)\n\nA few simple suggestions: \n\n1. Drop school sports from "OMG, it is vital to have a football team, and a swim team, and a hockey team, and so forth" to "It is nice to have a few special children that want to run around ouside. Maybe that way it will be easier for them to learn". Otherwise, include school sports fully in a budget, and calculate BOTH expenses for school sports and income from school sports, into the schools budget. \n\n2. It would be interresting to see what happens when you put down borders of spending , like, as an example, the maximum ammount of money that goes to school sports may not be above 10 % of the total schools budget, otherwise all federal funding for a school gets completely dropped. \n\n3. Just as a thought, because I am not above giving out money, how about we make, in exchange for the 10 % rule, a rule that says, 10 % of the budget increases have to go to teacher salaries? So, whenever the budget for the school gets increased, we increase the salaries of the teachers?\n\n4. Lock the salary of the board members , and any administrative staff, to the average of what a teacher in their district makes? I mean, I don't know, but lets say we take the per year figures, and go, at most, if you work in school adminisration, you can maximally make 20 times what an average teacher in a school makes? Works for CEO's and businesses, why shouldn't it work for schools, right? \n\n5. Open up home economics, and fund a competition on the level of school food. At the same time, strike all extra lunch money from he teachers budget, and FORCE all teachers of a school to eat what they serve their students? Hell, having good food shhould be just as important as having good teams. \n\n6. Tie funds to accademic archievements they are used for. If saifd accademic archievement does not show, remove the extra funds. \n\nI would be honestly surprised if that should not bring down the "bang for the buck" ratio of your school. 
Oh? I kind of... wait...\n\nThere was this other thing.... \n\nYou kno, systematic raping of prisoners by US military.... \n\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/05/05/how-many-were-tortured-to-death.html\n\nIr the non prosecution of nazi calliber war criminals? \n\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/id/6988054/\n\nThe celebration and a slap on the wrist for those human swine who participated in torture and manslaughter? \n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2016/08/25/u-s-military-now-says-isis-leader-was-held-in-notorious-abu-ghraib-prison/ \n\nOr, you know, that a strange ammount of people who have innocently been detained, tortured, and then released from this prison, only to turn up with a massive grudge against the people who sposored human rights abuse. \n\nNo idea either?\n\nMakes me wonder how anybody could have had any ideas how some people got it in their heads that this kind of behavior has a place on the battlefield, or off of it. 
I see legs, but I don't see them squatting... are you sure this is addidas?
Simple. They have proven that feelings of insecurity, or of facing predjeduce, are often based less on actual fact then more on, you know, feeling. \n\nThe interresting thing would have been to see if the rates at which predjeduce / ect was percieved changed at all, if the subject ot the impression a white woman / black woman / asian woman / white man / black man / asian man was in charge. \n\nIf the assumption however was, lets prove the theory of "Only white men can be sexist...." .... Well, I guess feels trump facts, right?
The morally correct response is a concentrated DDOS attack on all listening ports. I mean, seriously, they sell a spy doll`to germany? Does that not fall under the hackerparagraph?

OOOh, I won't deny that he is without a sparkly white vest. I freely give you that. \n\nBut if I hold the arrest of pussy riot against the pictures of Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghreib, I do see a difference. And that worries me. \n\nPlus, suppression of political dissidents... We could argue that this is in detail what america does to Assange, Manning and Snowden, but that the only difference is in the level of competency in which they are performed. \n\nGuess if you scream "America Uber alles" so often that it drowns out everything else, you get that nice hazy high. \n\nBut please, tell me more about how Russia is dangerous. Hugely dangerous. I bet you have got tremendous intel from excellent secret sources? Binders full of it? When will there be the next daughter of a diplomat citing in front of UN council that Russia is pulling babies out of incubators? Or does your superb five eyes community plagiarize the next grad student paper, and then say it came from secure sources? 
Well, the best trick is, let them talk. \n\nAfter all, they give you exactly what they want. make them work for it. \n\nThey have a slaver, right? They want the slaver to cooperate with them, correct? Not take them as slaves? \n\nThen, drive it home. \n\nLet them make their argument, then, make the roll. \n\nFor you, it is a choice.... are they relying too heavily on he diplomancer? Have they degraded the value of the CR? \n\nLets say a slaver attacks hem and tries to capture them. \n\nI mean, the healthiest trick is, have they invested in the language? \n\nTake it honest, maybe your slaver speaks a dialect. maybe the slaver has an ingraned racism against people who speak a certain way. Maybe the slaver thinks people who speak common are untrustworthy, because common speakers killed his family. Maybe the slaver was tortured, and has PTSD that is triggered by common. \n\nThen, think of the arguments the players used. Think of how often a slaver would have heard the same arguments. Think of what arguments a potential slave may have used to do this. To escape being enslaved. A potential slave would be ready to promise everything that keeps him from being a slave. And lets not forget, high charisma still means something, right? It means that there are brothels willing to pay for this. And it means that a base sin of greed is worth something. \n\nAnd then the best laid plans can get put to waste, if it comes out tha the players killed the litle brother of the head slaver..... that had the mind of being a magician, that went to magician college, and that wen home for the holidays, that asked ma and pa to go out with the big slaver.... And then goit killed because he thought he could go and just attack the big boys. \n\nOf course, if you have apaladins in the group, offer them easy outs. Only they are the outs that they don't want to take. The slavers are willing to not blast hem if they get a slave out of this. If the players play, let them give an NPC. Let them give a fellow party member. let them soak in the knowledge that the party paladin is now one step closer to not getting backing of the god. Or, they just want fellow worshippers of asmodeus. Offer to let them pass if they pray to asmodeus, loud and clear, and he sents them a sign. \n\nOf course, if they dredge up every random encounter between here and tuson, they insist on pausing between every fight..... \n\nThen fuck me, half the random encounters will just be passing along. \n\nAfter all, you are a DM. You are not a monster. 
Fuck it, I studied in Bremen, and found myself in strangely familliar territory. \n\nApart from you guys having a genetical defect that makes it impossible for you to make firewood and not look goofy, or be terribly ineffective at it, I have to say, I heartily approve of all of your nortern german traditions, from Mettbrötchen over Labskaus to your Dialect. \n\nThe most measurable advantage is that you are not directly standing in the spotlight everytime germany is mentioned, but it kind of balanced out by the fact that bavaria does not have to deal with scandinavian drinking tourism. And while you Bastards have Jeever, and thus can not ever be forgiven for what you did to beer, we have bradwoschdg'häck, and thus are equally punished. \n\nSo, as the north say, "Dann mann tau". 
Why, thank you. \n\nSome people believe beards are beautifull. 
LMAO 😂😂😂
Basically, lots of rights were a kind of way to say, "I am sorry we treat you horrible, have a right. "\n\nForced militar service? Have a right as a way to say sorry. \n\nGenital mutilation? Have a right as a way to say sorry. \n\nIn general, the idea here is, if you get pushed to do some shit you can't say no to, and that personally inconveniences you, like for example forced mandatory military service, you were deemed willing to sacrifice for the greater good, thus elegible for the rights. \n\nThe entire idea of rights was kind of a way to say, we know you are worthless pieces of shit compared to women, so lets give you some rights to make you feel better about the fact that we treat you horribly and disgustingly. \n\nI mean, shit, if there was a rule that women had to sign up for selective military service, and fight for their country, and the only way to get out of this was to have a child and not abort it, but carry it to term and then give it up for adoption, then I guess you would have a nice negotiation base to demand rights. \n\nBut as a society, we have allways been nicer to women. We have protected them, excempted them, tried to treat them as nicely as possible, ect. 
Oh no. \n\nIs it reddit, or the propaganda division of the americans? Signed into law like the torture of prisoners of war? 
The interresting thing is, he is actually quite intelligent. \n\nThe previous generation leaks were just, you know, leaks. People speaking up. \n\nIf you can however prove that the next generation leakers were paid for by , you know, the CTR people, just to name an example.... then you exit one sphere and you get to an other. 
As I said. we could be prepared, but appaently, as long as profits are being made, fuck the public. \n\nJust for comparison, compare the antrax epidemic. \n\nThe only counter agent to this was held by the germans. Bayer pharmaceuticals. \n\nThe US then basically said, either we are revoking your parent protection on this, and produce it for ourselves, or you sell it to us at the price we want. \n\nI would simply argue if this happens with a bio weapon that was develloped by a company or a country, the same should be applied there. 
Question: where is the sourcecode / the app / the .exe? \n\nI want this to download and see how it behaves. 
> How did males, whose purpose is to fight each other and donate sperm to any female who will allow it, get deemed the better half of the species?\n\nIt was in answer to this. \n\nThink of it that way. \n\nThe idea that maybe, we need to be nice to each other, is relatively new in historical context. Just look at your own word. Subjugation. It presumes the idea that simeone is actively keeping you down. \n\nSwitch the idea 90 °'s, and watch it from a male perspective. You get to fight in wars against your will, you get to be dirty, and the government says, oh, yea, well, that's so we get to sugjugate the other half of the population, so they can preserve the human race. \n\nThis is why historically, where there was a need for females to give up rights, "for the greater good", there allways was a push to reward this with rights, the same way it was "expected" by men.\n\nFor example, look to Israel. Mndatory enlistment, full military service, relatively equal position of the women, except in areas of religion. \n\nGreece knew the geese of athens, a fully female military regiment, that enjoyed the rights comparable to other soldiers. \n\nShit, look to the mongols, and Börthe and Obodai. Look to asia. \n\nAs soon as women were forced to give up rights "for the greater good", the reward was allways, historically, gaining the same rights as  the men who did the same gained. \n\nHonors are on a different page, as you can see in certin burrial customs, or in wise mothers. But rights were , historically, dished out by "how much do we ask of you to give up " measurement, and over the years, whenever there was a concentrated push by women to give up rights and freedoms equal to mens, they were allways rewarded equally, if not better, in terms of the government saying, "we feel awfull that we have to pressure you into this. "\n\nOOh, and for the "whose purpose it is to donnate sperm to any woman who is willing to allow it", we could say, in a similar tongue in cheek fashion, that Mothers were ALLWAYS treated better then women who had no children at all. But that would be basing worth on the arbitrary criteria of the ability to get pregnant and have life offpring, and not even I am willing to sink that low. 
simple resolution: \n\nallow your party rogue to run into a few singl battles ahead of the group. \n\nNothing bad, but basically, there can allways be a few children playing around, or a drunk person sleeping, ect.... \n\nSee how he handles himself. \n\nThen, when the group progresses, have them see what the rogue did to children.\n\nUsually, after 2-3 times, the rogue is no longer keen on scouting ahead. \n\nIf that is too harsh, use the combar turn system. If the player wants to scout ahead, he can do so, but in 6 second intervalls. 
Folding @ home is like.... 2001...... I much rather have something actually nerdy going on. I am allways itching for a new benchmark\n
I find it strange that you know a lot of racists. \n\nI mean, what? \n\nYou were ok with Obama torturing people? Bombing MSF was just a thing? \n\nWith Bush, you were cool? When he lied to you to commit a warcrime? \n\nYou were good with the clintons? \n\nI mean, shit, racist is pretty bad. \n\nBut you know what is worse? \n\nPeople who choose to speak up for justice and their conciousness only when it is easy. \n\nI repect the people who called Obama a mass murdering lunatic who continued Bushes politics. \n\nI respect the people who called Clinton a cold War Hawk, even when it looked like she was the only one. \n\nTo now call Trump out on his bullshit , or on the people he associates with, is a start. But that needs to become a habit. The next time a political candidate fights manifactured fake news by implementing her own fake news, It needs to become political suicide. \n\nThe next time america itches to pick up nuclear war, trhere needs to be a pistol on americas chest, and the sound of the hammer being pulled back before the echo has passed. \n\nThe next time you get asked to trust your government when they tell you because of secret facts, they know the now have to attack this other country, you need to rise up and go, show us the fucking facts, or we aren't moving. \n\nBut most likely, after Trump has his eight years, miraculously, the influence will dwindle. People will go back to the ver same apathetic mass. \n\nYou complain now that racists are voting for trump? That is what you get when yoiu drive the people out to vote, and you make it impossible for people to have a viable alternative. \n\nYou want to be anrgy? Have your ar face on? \n\nThen cuss out those liberals who stayed home on voting day. Beat the people who tell you that voting does not change anything, beat them with sticks untill they scream. \n\nI have seen them. They are out there. Anbd guess what, they have just been proven wrong. And we are now tasting the fruits of their work. \n\nDon't slap a nazi. Slap the shit out of that fuck that tells you voting does not change anything, then take him out the back and curbstomp him. That changes things. \n\nIf "voting does not change anything" becomes as acceptable as running in full Ku klux klan regalia through detroit after dark, THEN shit will change. When the left finally realizes, that complaining about your opponent does nothing when you do not even have a secure leg to stand on. When you internalize, not repeat, not do lipservice to, but understand that the only cure for hatespeech is more speech, THEN you will start to win. \n\nMeanwhile, look towards the sanders camp. They don't complain, they continue to work their way up from the grass roots. 
The only way to handle this is like adults. \n\nWhen divorce time comes, simply say she had already taken posession of a very nice car and then decided to decrease its value permanently. \n\nIf that was not your mentally deficcient Girlfriend, it is property damage.

Okay. First off, it seems straightforwards. \n\nWhy not simply give out the money as a signup bonus? Zero advertisement, zero ads, just pay those people signing up a more then decent wage? \n\nBut I suspect it is more of a "We kind of have to do a thing with the thing, so we need the money" action, something you do at the end of the fiscal year, so the next year they don't cut your budget. \n\nOtherwise, hell, we would have 300 million / 6000 = 500000 Dollar per recruit. \n\nColor me surprised, but lets take half of that, right? \n\nSo, we have 250000 dollar per recruit. \n\nIf we just count kit, we have http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21105586/ns/us_news-military/t/gis-gear-costs-times-more-wwii/#.VIV-OfmUeVM to go by. \n\nLets assume we just give those people the "good" kit, like the 60,000 variant. That leaves us 140000 dollars. \n\n(http://work.chron.com/much-enlisted-army-soldiers-make-28798.html) tells us, "The highest enlisted rank, E-9, earns $4,836.90 per month with over 10 years' experience"\n\nSo, theoretically, the army could outfit the soldier with brand new kit, and pay 29 months of wages at top level. \n\nMind you, that is for half of it. I mean, practically speaking, for 140000 dollars, you can do the really good shit, like hire a tutor, cleaning lady, gardener, ect. Lets assume we have an average signup of 10 years, with no washout. \n\nYou can either pay E9 for 90 months, which can easily be stretched to 120 months of very good pay, or you could pay top dollars for recruitment, and have just a chance of getting the soldier. \n\nCan you say, "we prefer to waste money for publicity? "
^^\n\nI never thought it possible, but will we soon see SJW`s go the same way as Che guevara? From a revolutionary icon to a marketing ploy that gets printed on target shirts that ironically get worn by hipsters.

OOOh, you want my login credentials / social media accounts? \n\nHere, have them. \n\nOOOh, you think it is weird that most of them look unused?\n\nWell, the funniest thing happened. \nHere I was, thinking about how to beome a productive american citizen, when out of nowhere I get this virus that is from the FBI and asks me to deposit bitcoins with them, or else they will not unlock my computer. \n\nSo, if you want to challenge that my social media accounts are fake / purpose created, and that I am holding information back, lets get a government suppena first, right? \n\nOh, and if I get denied because of that, I will sue our asses in the ground because you denied me fair application. Why should they? OOh, I will demand a supena into the FBI / CIA's cybercrime divisions activities, because we have reasonable suspicions that I was targetted because of illegal activity by a government entity that did this knowing full well I had nothing to do with this. \n\nOr in the immortal words of Hunter S Thompson: \n\n"My recollections of the last twelve hours are very dim. All that I know for certain is that shortly after I (logged in) in, two third-world drug abusers disguised as (federal agents) forced their way into my (computer); ransacked it, (filled all my harddrives up with porn), (Ran up my steam account by frivulously buying strategy games), (stole my Passcodes) and filled my harddrives with pornographic images of Angela Merkel and Donald Trump. Why yes, yes that's called a belgian chocolate, that's where she dumps.... "
To argue with "its still child porn", the proper response is to prosecute both the producer and the consumer. \n\nThe argument of "Its still child porn" is, well, we have no really good arguments why we want to prosecute, so we fall back on the tried and tested "Think of the children. "\n\nWhich in turn somehow dissolves into, "The girl gets off scott free, while the guy has to register as a violent sexual predator for life or go to jail. "\n\nThe proper response to this is to prosecute by the exact same standart the girl. \n\nYes, you may go, "but she is a girl, buhuhu, she is in mental health care, ect...."\n\nSorry, but if you simply went, 120 hours of community service, I would agree. Slap on the wrist for the guy. \n\nBut if you go, OOOh, he is a violent sexual offender, then I am sorry, this is not a slap on the wrist, this is a double standart. And the only way to resolve this is to get the girl on the hook for producing and distributing child porn
The advantage of first realizing early on that you are not half as hideous as you thought. \n\nFree unmonitored wifi. \n\nSurviving for myself on my own cooking. \n\nBeing able to move with 2 big duffleags and a laptop bag. \n\nMeeting fraternity guys and sorority sisters and seeing what fuckery they are up to. 
simple answer: do you think the impeachment will stop if clinton is on the throne?
Pathfinder society is kind of the living greyhawk 2.0 , or living faerun, or the ravenloft campaign of the katagane, mask of the red death. You DO know it has been done before, right? \n\nI hope you do not skip over the basics of roleplaying, and just turn it into the worlds slowest party of wow without a computer, right? \n\nIf you have a problem roleplayer, deal with it like a DM should. That is 101, that can be discussed by anyone, inside or not. If you chose to not discuss that with outsiders, and go, I have to slavishly adhere to the adventures, shit, I can see why most beginner DM's have problems with that. \n\nThe basic trick of the DM's bag is, you canb beat a problem player by 3 points. \n\n1. Rules. The main thrill of the sneak ahead rogue is that you get pirst pick of the rooms, and first pick of the loot. Simply put, take synhronicity against that. Lets say you have a 60 feet long corridor. movement rate is 30 feet per second, less if you want to sneak. So, you can calculate that the player has 3 combat rounds for the corridor, and boom. Take it as just an other action to take during combat. This way, the char has to be in synchronicity with the party. Things can not happen while the party is safely tucked away in combat time, and the outstanding player gets 5 minute pieces of time to scout ahead. Nope, combat time is combat time for everyone. \n\n2. Party. Simply put, a player does not have to be able to participate in a fight, he can simply deny an opposing player the advantage. Like, for example, imagine a town with a bell tower. Perfect snipers nest, right? If the tower is not held by the heroes, People like the enemies can hold it, and can go there. Or, to put it bluntly, a glass cannon is a thing of beauty, when it has a sneak attack. You can resolve this in any way you like. simply, do the XP calculations out loud. Say, you have 5 players in the party. You go, okay, that encounter was 300 XP, we had 6 players, so 50 XP per player. The players will go, well, we were 5 people fighting, so shouldn 't that have been 60 per player, for all 5? Recalculate. then, have extra XP for figuring out traps. Demand radio silence if the rogue is scouting out ahead. He demands to solve the problems alone? let him get ALL the extra XP for that. If the rogue is going to sneak away, and again steal the XP mant for the party, there have been barbarian players who simply stepped on a rogues foot, and thus reduced his movement rate. If you can't bring the problem player under your controll, and get him to play with the group, the party is capable of doing that. especially if he is the kind of rogue who demands to be handed the treasure lists first, and who loots ahead, ect. Just discuss it openly, and go, it's my table, I have not prepped it otherwise. If the rogues shennanigans force you to break the game for 5 minutes after every encounter that the rogue scouts out, and thus cut the time the players have to enjoy the prty, and the rogue then gets all the treasure to himself, and goes towards, you guys, my char has stolen half your loot, lets see if you guys notice.... yea... even you can see what will happen if this happens too often. \n\n3.  Be adults about it. I mean, for one, your party knows best what it likes. I mean, lets look at it realistically. perhaps your party does enjy the rogue going forwards? Your party does like the rogue handling the party purse? Have an open actually adult situation about it. your players are adults too, and thus, appreiate if they are handled liuke those. Say o them what you have said to us. After all, Pathfinder, even if it is pathfinbder society, is just about that: a couple of friends having a good time together. Woulkd you insist hanging out at the friends house where his girlfriend is annoyed? or in the basement of the guy who lives with his parents? Nope, as adults, you want to have fun. You want to have the fun that says, okay, we spend 3-4 hours in harmony and company, so lets try this. If someone is a part of that group, and as important as the DM of the group, his concerns should be taken validly. I have seen too many good DM's burn out just because the problem players have not been adressed properly, or have been taken lightly, o they were shy of conflicts. Bring that conflict. If the player says, I don't want to play with the party, would you ruin a solo adventure for him? Let him sneak ahead of the group, and solve an entrire adventure alone? Or, would you say, okay, here is the door, let me play with the group, You can have a smoke outside, and listen in? \n\nYou are the DM for gods sake, you are providing the fun for the party, so the minimum the party can do is make it as fun as possible for you. And sometimes, the result will also be thatwe take care of the problem plyer for you. If you suffer alone, it's fun for no one. If you can not handle a problem player, give a signal. There are more then one veteran in any given group that will gleefully accompany a problem player and show him the door. Because if the DM stops having fun, the veteran knows, we stop having fun. 
How to get accepted as a male.  \n\n0. Drop all pretense that you are welcome. Think yourself as the equivalent of a guy who is allowed on a girls night out. You are not wellcome, you are endured. People are curious. Cut out that self concious need to find acceptance. You are odd. You are not male. The first step to resole a problem is to recognise that you have one. Now, I will tell you a secret. Most men are carefull around sluts. We like sluts, they are nice to look at, but as soon as they become interrested in us, we go active and either go in interrested mode, or uninterrested mode. You want us PASSIVE. Also, forget that you are off the table because they have a significant other. That just means you just became doubly dangerous. Not only could they inadvertendly start drama because you understood a signal wrong, you could also inadvertendly start drama because their SO's understood a signal wrong. \n\n1. Get your makeup off. I know how you feel, Makeup is for you, and all that shit, but no. Makeup is for making you attractive to guys / girls. Just go without, or if you can afford it, as little as possible. Ask a man in your life, "do you think I wear makeup?" If he says yes, get the scrub brush, and scrub it off. You see the guys dolling up? I bet you there is a guy who has jeans with pizza stains. Instead of slaving away for hours, just.,.. don't. If that feels difficult, instead, have a beer.\n\n2. Go EASY on the perfume / deo / ect. Men are creatures of the nose. Perfume is for attracting mates and smelling good. an easy trick is to buy one brand of deodorant, that you don't wear everyday, but just for game night. The most bland and boring deodorant you can find, and bonus points if it is a mans deo. Think axe. Coordinate with what the group wears. If they wear it, out it goes. Appear clean, but not overly attractive. Kind of little sister style. All that shit you learn about smelling good is PRECISELY what they said this is for.... \n\n3. Stop the flirting. Even the stuff you consider harmless. Female allure, ect. That is for attracting a mate. It is like a man crashing a girls night, and swinging his dick around, whle shouting, I am one of you , girls! Girl power! Unless you cut the fuck out of flirting, touching, ect, they will have their slut decetor up. No games, and when you are even thinking of using games, imagine a big fat hairy man doing the same with your lady friends. You are literally the neckbeard destroying a ladies night out by making it awkward. \n\n4. Clothing style: Look towards the guys. They dress up for this shit? No? Then DON't either. You say frumpy, we say comfy. As an experiment, imagine yourself, sunday morning, going out, getting a pizza, going home, pulling the telephone off the wall, and going in for a netflix maraton. Then, imagine the outfit you would go out to get some more wine from the gass station. COMFY. That is what the rest of the guys wear, right? They don't think, I must impress my friends. They think, I have to sit with these cocksuckers in a room for four hours, because I have no life apart from this, and the only way I can endure this is hammered, and in comfy clothes. \n\n5. Jokes. Google jewish humor. See the kind of humor guys smile at. Now, you will not be guy humor material. stay away from insinuating guys are gay, sex, ect. Remember, those are active topics. Passive. If I think of some of my male friends, I don't think, man, this guy is super attractive. I think, fuck me, that's X, he has a job he fucking hates, that's y, His crazed girlfriend is a complete psycho, that's Z, I better not fuck up on technical specs because I know that whorehopper will give me a half hour lecture on what I fucked up on. Show them there is more to you then being attractive. It starts with cutting sex out of the vocabulary, at least for an hour or four. \n\n6. Now, the baseline of behavior is, think of a little brother joining a ladies night. The girls will be cautious about him, and it will take a long damn time till they are up to their usual things. YOU are the little sister of the group of guys. \n\n7. A beginners mistake is the three big nos. Hair, tits, legs. Remember, you are not here to get you a man, you are here to BE a man. Men have neither of those. So, for an evening, drop your body language, and mirror a guy, every 15 minutes picking a new target. He sits his legs apart, you do so. Learn makle body language. Immitate the guys. Fuck it, bonus points if you wear a sports bra. See from the guys what is acceptable. Go with that. It is easier if you have yourself an other beer. \n\n8. Now, the hardest part for females is to throw off an ingrained sense of self worthlessness and constant competition. Look at a female group. Competition to the max, vying for the top spot. Now, look at a male group. Every single male, in the group, if they admit it or not, know they are the shit. They have a beer gut? They don't care, they are the shit. They are balding? They don't care they are the shit. Take an hour before the game night, and practice being male. All that shit that is engrained as being ladylike, throw it out of the window. You are the shit. Repeat it to yourself. You. are. the. shit.\n\n
Trump is the Black Hat President. \n\nHe does not try to improve a broken system. That is white hat. \n\nHe does no try to fix a broken system. That is grey hat. \n\nHe puts the foot in the crunching machine, and forces the discussion, destroying the illusion that this is still salvageable. \n\nProblem: Fake news is a loosely defined term. \n\nwhite hat solution: Offer an actual unified standart of fake news, take input from everybody, but prefer experts. \n\ngrey hat: heavily question news stories that seem to contracdict reality. actually helöp peoiple recognise fake news stories no matter if they come from CNN or Breitbart\n\nBlack hat: Start calling everything fake news. \n\nProblem: certain cities refuse to implement federal laws regarding immigrants and enforcing the whole lot. \n\nWhite hat solution: Make better laws. Kindly ask cities to start policing them. \n\ngrey hat solution: Threaten that the policing of what you want policed will have an influence on federal monies. See if they implement before you have to pull up. \n\nBlack hat solution: Lets build a wall. Lets block all federal funds for sanctuary cities. Make them talk. \n\nI am serious  This is the one thing where trump is eeril consistent. He does not fix, or reform, he kicks the dead and dirty bits that others patched over untill they break. \n\nI for one want to see more of this. If it takes you eight days of him being president to flip out and go ham with suffered racism, you are not ok untill trump came. You were pacified with the promise of more to come. Your silence was bought with the promise of  "Oh, obama can't do much, because he has congress and senate against him...". You said, okay, lets wait, the next president will fix that. \n\nHis, despite everything that he has legitimately done, I am proud of him for. Bcause after tTrump threatened the wall, veryone knows what a sanctuary city is. And there are different oppinions on those. \n\nAfter trump picked the immigration policy up, it was no longer, ooh, the dreamer act, and so forth.... \n\nIf the record continues, Trump can clean up the problem of the war on terror by swearing that he will double down on Bushes anti terror war, he will single handedly rescue Abortion rights by going, lets ban all abortion and make it punishable by death. ...\n\nIt sems, and correct me if I am wrong, his entire issue is, changes that are bound to come, he pushes through, changes that are important to make, and that have to be made, he opposes in order to unify all his critics into making them for him. \n\nJust think, what happens when the next president is a democrat, and they again try to push their candidate down peoples throats? \nImagine what happens the next time fake news gets used? \n\nOr when the democrats act hesitant on an issue? \n\nOr, when the next democratic candidate has a shady past ?\n\nAfter this election season, the trust in media is at an alltime low. \n\nAt the same time, we have: \n\n- Republicans worshipping gay speakers, and more gay acceptance then in years from the republican side. \n\n- Republicans going happy with russia. \n\n- republicans being, just to spie trump, extra generous with the progressive stuff. \n\nAnd yes, it seems like Trump is reagan in china, his arms wide.....\n\nBut I have a better comparison. He is doctor cox. \n\nHe is an asshole, and he enjoys it. He makes people cry. He kicks you where it hurts. He tortures you. He calls you names. \n\nBut when he is gone, you are more competent then before. you have rid yourself of several things, and you managed to get good. you no longer make rookie mistakes, and you are actually able to survive on your own. \n\nThe most important and sweeping reforms in the USA will be because of Trump. \n\nI mean, look at the war reporting. Under obama, dronestrikes were anything but well documented. First mission under trump, we have a full page play by play, including what surgial actually means. This shit sells. It has become vogue. SSuddenly, the media has a spine again. \n\nThe trick is, everything he invokes, is stuff that you can't put bck in the box again. \n\nIf tomorrow, obama came back, would you go, okaym let him torture in peace? After you knew how well it felt to call a president an incompetent fucktard? \n\nIf Tomorrow president palin deided to invade Somalia, would you think people would just support the troops? Or would they call them out on their bullshit? \n\nIf Sudenly, we learned that there are terror training camps, and they are funded by president trump, would you just let him continue? or would it for ever become political suicide to even be anywhere close to allowing the secret service to fund foreign civil conflicts? \n\nIf I am right, here is what trump will do: \n\n- he will increase the authority of the three letter agencies to spy on americans. \n\n- he will be harsh on crime. \n\n- he will actually clamp down on the wall idea. \n\n- he will not back off the social justice topics, but double down on them. \n\n- He will alienate the same people obama, bush and mister clinton alienated. \n\n- He will try to replace healthcare with something that ammounts to free prayer only. \n\nhe will continue to hate and spew ignorance untill the public oppinion has arrivced at a point where it could not have, and then back off, giving his opponents a small victory, untill he tackles the next issue. \n\nHe has long since understood tha the democrats and the ruling people are by and large a heap of corruption, and they hate him for being there, so they will do their best to be as contrarian as possible to everyone. \n\nBy the end of things, he will try to take credit for all of what has happened. he will say that he saw what they did to obama, and the only way to curcumvent those people was to unify them in hatred against him. \n\nHe was the one to let them hate him, because he can take it. he is a multimillionbaire business man. he is hated every day. For once, him being hated on can helpm others deal with the shit. And if someone has to kick america where it hurts, beter him then bernie. \n\n
I know, I know... right after the NDSA tapps all electoral computers, and bugs everyones leaders phone... you know, just for reasons of terrorism prevention and national security, not because they want them nudes of mamma merkel...
AK I find is much easier to muck preflop than Qs (probably just me)\n\n(w/ QQ)If you flat the three bet and see a cbet on flop that is Queen-less and doen't have obvious draws out there or an A/K, you have to raise.\n\n(w/ AK)In the same situation, you can easily fold having missed everything and also having an understanding that this guy re-raised you preflop and is most definitely ahead of (probably crushing) your Ace high\n\nThe QQ loss... I can see him having 55, 33, 88, JJ with a 4x, I would say re-raise a substantial amount preflop instead of flatting.  If you lose to a set you got unlucky, but if you let them catch the set cheap, its on you.
Butterfly Effect was a sweet movie
You're funny
Be careful chewing on straws, I've heard they can do damage to your teeth.  God speed!
"Return crimea plox. "\n\n"Certainly, if you sign this paper that you will not push the nato east expansion, and use it to station rockets at my border. "\n\n"No way Ivan. That is a peacefull rocket shield. "\n\n"Then finalise your AUMF, and don't renew it. you can let it run out, but don't renew it. "\n\n"Nope. "\n\n"How about you fuck out of syria, and cease funelling weapons into a war zone? or we can both check the serial numbvers of the equipment ISIS uses, and follow the bank note numbers isis pays with. "\n\n"Those were accidents that could have happened to anybody. The syrian people deserve to be a protected minority. "\n\n"Even if their own government does not want you there? "\n\n"Well he oppresses against them. "\n\n"He calls them terrorists. "\n\n"He certainly would.... "\n\n"So, you say he should just acept other governments funding terrorists to topple his regime and install a puppet regime? "\n\n"We have the superior intelligence. Plus, we are only funding the moderate rebells. "\n\n"So, stop me if you have heard this before. A big government of superpower status decides to intervene in a country hat is close to its, what some call, neo colonist ambitions, simply to defend its interests. When questioned, they say that they are simply protecting ethnic and religious minorities, saying they percieved them as oppressed when no one else did. the other states protest, but taken together they are too afraid of do anything, when it becomes clear the superpower could simply ruin their economy again. Plus, their own power base grows frail as the stream of people from this country pushes over the border, which are now legally defined as refugfees and could not be sent back without stepping out of a lot of treaties. OOh, and when the superpower is asked when it will be over, it goes and says, "OOOh, when I have it just right. "
I wouldn't go that far. SJW's have realised that while in their heads, they are elves, noble and wise, in reality, they are dwarves: \n\nWeird, strange sense of humor, and they dug too far and created too many preccedents. And now, as they stop, and look into the abyss they created, they see something looking up at them. 
What was that about not interferring with other countries?
Okay, since the GF owns most of todays systems, and I occasionally get a chance to play for amusement value, here is my prediction. \n\nPC: Kind of nice. Steam and GOG is a huuuuge boost to it, but at the same time, once that is taken away, what really remains? I have never learned to shoot straight away without mouse and keyboard. so, that's that. But in genral, the PC is made for competetive gaming, and precision, and lots of people multiplayer. Most likely top title for PC: Landwirtschaftsmaschinensimulator 2017. I mean, honestly, PC is made for all games, but excells in the honestly weird ones. If you take away everything else, you will most likely have the PC lead the field, by raw numbers, with some charming 8 bit title that is also a sort of job simulator. \n\nPS4: Most impressivce game up untill now: Last guardian. That shit looks bad-ass, and inventive, and new. Projection: PS4 will do well all over the place, because it is so widespread. It will start to suck in all sorts of titles, andf if it can support some mods, it will slowly cut into the share of other gamesystems, pulling people away from them. It would start to pull more peiople away from them if the games went by the old quality standart, i.e., once you release, the game is finished, so no more bug fixes or nothing, but what do you have an internet connection or if not for updates? Most likely 2017 GOTY: An other part of the same formula. Meaning, an established title that has been re-released in a new format. Red dead redemption 2 is a strong contender, but the Trump card of Sony is allways the weird games, and the japano look . \n\nXBOXONE: Honestly, not as bad as most people think. GF seems to mostly use it as a cuss machine, to learn how to say "I fucked your mom" in different languages, or how to conjugate the big replacement words, like NIGGER or so. But, once you no longer play with random 5 year olds, it is actually quite fun. A huge boost to it is the budding relationship with windows 10, and the interconnectivity, on th same token, dem microsoft patches, do.   Sadly, outside of the US, you are very likely to be seen as exotic once you admit that you like XBOX. Most likely title: Some XBOX exclusivce that has been dropped to be released for PC, because of piracy, but oh wonder, after it was released for the XBOX, it also works for PC. Most likely GOTY? Some twin stick shooter that will be excessively adult, but will have surprising ammounts of 6 year olds playing. \n\napple: will release yet an other new thing, where you go with the thing, and its microgames, so it gamifies the real world. \n\nAndroid: Latest update for Ingress / pokemon go. \n\nNintendo: AAAh, good old nintendo. You can laugh, you can cry, but nintendo allways managed to get itself a place at the table by providing actual family entertainment. Something no other console could. you may laugh, you may cry, but you hace to admit, if you want to give your nephew a game for a thing, and have it be so family friendly that your sister will not beat you with a brick for enabling violence, 9/10 instances it will be a Nintendo game. ( or, minecraft / ect)\n\nGOTY precidtions for the combined list: \n\n1. New PC indie game, that is crossplatform, because it is actually under a gigabyte. 8-Bit charm mandatory. \n\n2. STEAM MMORPG. \n\n3. PS4 Game that is slightly autistic but charmingly japanese. Mandatory cinematic cutscenes. \n\n4. XBOX ONE twinstick shooter. Mandatory cutscenes that feel like tom clancy's the movie. \n\n5. Smartphone game that is a glorified step counter. 
Which is interresting, because they are the only people with experience to hate communism.\n\nEvery other american, except the immigrants, hates communism because of propaganda. They have never lived under communism, or socialism, or much else then the occasional democracy that they decried as "too european", and they only hate communism because they have been told to hate it. \n\nYou want to see real hatred for socialism? Try to talk to a german who lived in the DDR. Or to a russian who lived in the soviet union. Or to a taiwanese. \n\nThey can tell you all those highly personal stories, and most of them are of an abuse of power, that they were on the reccieving end of. \n\nThe trick is, those people, who have suffered personally under these governments, draw a very sharp line. They are willing to hate the government till the day they die, the people in power untill they die of massive strokes and die in agony, but they are iron clad about not hating the people wo had nothing to do with it. Their grievances are eerily specific. \n\nLike my uncle, who was one of the few people of west germany who moved to the DDR. Kind of the black sheep of the family, but as such, of course a source of coolness. As long as I could think, he had those massive bottles of booze, entire walls in his cellar, all lined with bottles. he never acknowledged them, allways telling me, yiou are too young. don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong. \n\nWhen I grew older, I was one day invited to him, provided I had a suit and could keep my mouth shut. He took out a big ass, 4 liter + glass bottle, and told me to read the label on the bottom. \n\nThen, without looking, he told me the story of how he came to bear this grudge, because said officcial had apparently acted with the secret police and had "Instigated" that my uncle should get the special treatment when the police picked him up. Trusted prty member, and all. Didn't even ask, just started to treat my uncle with the telephone book. An american would have perhaps called it enhanced interrogation, he just called it, a beating. Told my uncle if he wanted to leave the police station not limping, he should keep his western hands to himself the next time. \n\nNow, my uncle was a smart man, and he allways had a thing for good memory and a good sense of business. So, he basically opened a shop for booze, one of the only ways he could make money in east germany. Botztles came from everywhere, and he paid good money for them, and sold them even more expensive, under the hand. And in the cellar, one wall was dedicated to his personal grudges. One bottle of booze, from the year of birth of the person who deserved his grudge, and of a quality that according to him mirrored he value of the grudge. And he had them all. Heads of local government, military officers, people who collaborated with the secret police, people who started shit, members of the communist party in russia..... He had an entire row just reserved for the american presidents whom he felt deserving. \n\nBut he could tell you, if he felt you were old enough to drink with him, the story to each bottle. And what the grudge represented. \n\nHe could tell you what head of the committee that basically bought political prisoners from the DDR represented what bottle, and how the last few of them had died. He could tell you what he drank the day maggie Thatcher died, he could tell you what he drank the day the wall fell, he could tell you what he drank the day the soviet union dissolved. He kept the memories in his head, because if he had ever written them down, that could have been used as evidence, if they ever found out. \n\nThat is hatred. That is a grudge. \n\nBut he never, not even once, said that all the people were bad. He never even said the system was bad, never once blamed the politics, he allways was very specific, to the point of obsessive. He was picked up because he got into a demonstration, taken out, and bashed around a bit? He would wait patiently, and then start his inquiries. Who was the man whom he remembered beating him? Who was the man who held him back? Whom was the plain clothed officer? Was it possibl to see the records? And if he was convinced he could place the thing well enough, he would find out their date of birth, and an other bottle of booze would go up the shelves. \n\nThat is what you get from people who lived under the system. They remember that for every communist who needed the secret service, for every socialist who wanted to remove the counter revolutionary elements, for every good little citizen who told the officials, there were a hundred people who were caught in a shitty situation, and who held the same grudges, and bled the same blood. A hundred people who were kind as everyone, and who shared his problems. \n\nAnd this attitude is prevalent under everyone who actually has reason to hold a grudge. \n\nOnly the americans, or the american minded, have this special attitude where they disagree with the system. A thing even a person as grouchy as my Uncle would not have managed. He could not say, that despite him being beaten mercilessly in the DDR, being a political enemy, that the DDR was a bad system. He allways made sure to say fairly it had its good sides as well. He told me that for every bottle down there, there were ten times the ammounts of good memories. He said, and excuse me if I bastardize him a bit, if you could not remember a single good thing about smething, you had no reason to hold a grudge in the first place.\n\nAll I know was that he died, well in retirement, dressed up, in front of his computer, with a smile. Brain stroke. Over in seconds. \n\nAt his wake and funeral, I made it a point to go down in the cellar, and get the bottles, and placed them there. His son said nothing, and his wife just thanked me for being there, and asked me if I wanted any of his bottles. \n\nI did not take a single bottle of booze. But I made sure that every last grudge of his was killed, and the bottle good and thoroughly smashed. Even though I am sure one or an other bottle was worth something, it would have felt wrong to take over an other mans grudge. 
Valid. \n\nNobody disputes that Hillary had it in her to draw huge crowds, and with binders full of women storm the trenches. She could have easily won. \n\nAnd that's the problem. \n\nLets say we have a friendly american football game on. On the one side, the 49'ers. \n\nThat is what I would compare Clinton to. Not top of the pops, not best of the best,m but definitively, a fucking strong contender. \n\nOn th other side, we have the Bisbee killer termites, a city team, that basically lets everyone who wants to play, even if they are a drunk trucker or a city hobo. Only they play baseball. \n\nSo, immediatelly, you would be able to tell a few things: \n\n- hillary clinton and her 49'ers are a professional team. The killer termites are not. \n\n- Hillary clinton and her 49'ers play their chosen discipline. the Termites don't. \n\n- Hillary clinton and her 49'ers have played douzends of matches before. The termites haven't. \n\nThis can lead you to a few colums where you publically speculate if the 49'ers will bring down the termites, or if they will explode them. You have no idea if they will simply paint the field with the termites blood, but the thought that the termites could ever win does not even cross your mind. \n\nThe handfull of sports reporters that go, "you know what, Look at their habit, it says, anyone that wants can come play can play if someone on the team gives them their place...., and they have some pretty famous owners who follow their battles on social media.... " goes unheard. \n\nSo, matchday comes, and you have the 49'ers starting, enjoying the sun, doing warmups, and giving autographs of the fans. \n\nThen, they notice the first fans of the termies pull in, and.... Its not he fabs... it's the players. Not a single one of their players is in field gear, every single one basically points to the satute that says, he can loan his place n the game if he finds someone willing to take it. \n\nAnd they have. You see the busses pulling in in a long caravan, and out come the .... fans of the teams that hate the fucking 49'ers. That have been clowned off by the 49'ers, but that does not disturb them, because this is basically a poorly secured pitch, and someone had been feeding booze to these rotten bests all day, so they are in a fighting wish. BUt he pitch keeps growing, and growin g.... so suddenly, they have to play in the parking lot behind the local safeway, but no biggie, right, everyone brought their protective equipment, correct? \n\nAnd this is where the busses have been waiting..... and where you find out that 3 local residents heard of the opportunity to demolish the 49'ers, and fucking serve them, so thgey terrorised the internet, and let old connections play. One of then got Johnny Depp to make an appearance, and then used this to get an appearance of Bradley Manning, someone apparently ran for mayor on a drugs basis, and ceased to use the slogan "bastmode" and "NO-brainer", provided the people would show up, and discuss it after a game. So, while you slowly realize that you sitting on your ass all this time and not even looking at social media all this time might have been a bad idea, you barely even register how an all star team of NFL players, that were in on the joke, destroys the 49'ers on he safeway parking lot field. \n\nSo, we have a very good team, that is basically running a no contest match, and that then skips on the training. Hillary knew from the start that if she won against trump, it would be like winning against a retard. Nothing to be proud of. But if she and the democrats lost against a retard, what would that make them? Lower then retards? \n\nThis is the problem. Hillary was supposed to take this seriously. \n\nWe can't blame trump for showing ingenuity, and spirit, and literally being awake 24/7, touring and entertaining people. That's his shot. he is putting in the effort he feels this deserves. \n\nWe can't blame him for circumventing the media and going under their radar, hitting everybody where hey least expected i, right in the rust belt. \n\nWe can't blame him for realizing that the black vote, the female vote, the gay vote, the indian vote, the muslim vote and the mexican vote stretch out your capabilities. You can't donnate 100 % focus to every vote. \n\nBut if you donnate 100 % to get he fucking white male nonvoter, that has not voted in years , you cover 3 very important subgroups, that because they are so big, they have not mattered in years. \n\nOOOh, and did Hillary just publically drop the fucking white males of bernie sanders under the bus? \n\nI never said that HIllary was not qualkified, good, or competent enough. I just said, that I personally put the blame on HER for slacking of. For feeling too secure. For ending the training montage after she feels winded. \n\nAnd there was no way that donald could ever win. Untill, you know, she suddenly slacked off, and took a family time out. Donald just kept his schedule a bit looser. Untill she decided, Lets denigrate the bernie supporters as bros and fucking white males, and call the republicans a basket of deplorables. OOOh, Wasn't that exactly the only group that donald could legitimately focus on? Did she just hand them , giftwrapped and all, to donald?\n\nAnd so, since she slacked off, and clowned around, and gave donald all the support she could, I feel justified to say, if she had not given him so much leeway, if she had taken him seriously, then we would not be in this scenario. \n\nIt does not matter if "the rules were different/ unfair" "The other side is a basket of deplorables" "Look at me using cooky catchphrases", what matters in the end is if you can win the game. \n\nAnd legitimately speaking, donald should have had no chance to win the game. NONE. But he did. \n\nAnd that leaves he question, who is more to blame for donalds victory? Donald, who simply gave it the attention he thought it deserved, O clinton and the DNC, who everytime when they had donald ina  pickle just alienated more of their voter base / gave Trump an other advantage. 
Okay. \n\nYou have a couple of possibilities to consider. \n\nOne, treat it as assault, which it clearly is. Problem is, it feels like it should be more. \n\nTwo, treat it as murder, and while it feels right, it is the beginning to make abortions illegal, and play into the hands of thge religious extremists. \n\nHowever, fear not, because the german has a solution: \n\nWatch it as an abortion being performed. Without a license, with unsanitary equipment, provider does not even have rudimentary medical training, provider does not have medical malpractice insurance, provider did not provide sufficcient aftercare, ect.... \n\nYou have a solid black mark, I,e, abortion performer, and then, the modifier. You do not take a stance, either for abortion, or againt abortion, you simply treat the idiot who thought it was a good idea to kick a pregnant woman in the belly as a person who operates as a doctor / medical personell without having the required licenses, equipment or insurance. Drag him before the medical board, and have them help determine what is up. \n\nI would even get one step further. Give him, retroactively, a virtual medical license, so she can get good treatment under the malpractice insurance, and the dude has a steady reminder how much his insurance rates on his medical malpractice inbsurance went up for the rest of his life as he struggles to pay them. \n\nI would, by the way, treat cops the same way, or people who do this type of shit while on the job, only then it would not be "freelance", it would be, performed commercially without a license. And the positive side effect of having blacklisted a police department as a criminally unsafe abortion provider, well, that just makes me smile. \n\n
Nuclear energy is, if we are talking concept stage, incredibly safe and secure. \n\nIf practically, you give it to the lowest bidder, and then let things decay, hell, You get errors if you let everything decay that much.

I would actually, as paradoxically as it sounds, do exactly that. \n\nTax the robots as if they were people. \n\nMeaning, if you employ a robot worker in your plant, tax him as if he were a human. robot algorithm? Also tax him as if he were a human. \n\nSo, a robiot worker pays into the retirement fund, into the union fund, into gifts for coworkers funds, ect....\n\nIf you replacxe your workforce with robots, be prepared to still pay the taxes of a workforce. \n\nPositive side effect: If the robots one day gain sentience, they at least have a legal leg to stand on., no taxation without representation.

but its *your* name.... 
irony at its worst.  It's a really good example of irony however since its related to childfucking, its bad. very bad
awesome.  I'm proud to be so ignorant about the drug I can't even spell it
Shit does not get done untill you do it. \n\nOverarching theme of the week. \n\nI mean, I get it it is nice to say, you are problematic, and put a finger in a wound. It really is. Feels good. \n\nBut I have learned my lesson. \n\nThis is precisely why Black lives matter is understandable, and this is precisely why it will fail. \n\nBecause it takes calling people out because of respectability politics, and then exempts itself. \n\nOOOh, your boss said the N word? Protest tiem? \n\nSure thing. I allways say yes to a few more free days. \n\nBut when it comes to policing yourself, we enter respectability politics, and the black community themself does not seem to like that one bit. \n\nSure, we get some lip service, about how that woman is crazy, and she is not our leader, and how shen should step down.... \n\nBut that is like going "Donald Trump is a racist piece of shit yellow hair having orange devil, lets punt that bitch back to oompa loompa land" "So I can count on you at the protests?" "Naa, I'm just saying, he should step down, by himself, no pressure. "\n\nWhy is it so hard to say the following words: \n\nThis woman is crazy, untill she steps down, BLM Toronto is nonexistant to me?\n\nI mean, that is easy, right? You let your words follow actions. Insane person uses BLM as a personal springboard for her own brand of crazy, lets remove her platform? If the plaform is not removed the platform itself becomes irrelevant. Make a new platform. As long as you have 5-10 people, and a place to meet, you can rebuild BLM toronto from the ground up. \n\nBut I admit, it is one hell of a scary thought. To speak up against her, and to realize, wait a second, she is just the tip of the iceberg. She is literally the least outspoken person there. Oh god, have you heard the stuff other people of BLM toronto say? \n\nI guess it is safer to just admonish the leader, from a distance. Hell, I understand every insance. \n\nI hope you too understand why Stuff like this makes me go, hrm..... I am for their stated goals, in general, but stuff like this makes me go, hrm, is that an argument I can march on the streets behind? Could I march behind "Black lives matter" , which I actually agree with completely, while the side banners read "We agree with Toronto: Whites are a genetic defect" and "whites are subhuman"?
Someone asked me to milk her.... and apparently growing up on the countryside and actually having learned how to milk by hand has its disadvanatages. When you take things..... Litterally. 
If he had assassinated Assad on flimsy faked Evidence, the US would have been kicked out of the NATO and the United Nations so fast and labelled a terrorist allieance and a committer of warcrimes that it would have crashed their currency and economy faster then anything. \n\nCalling Clinton the Mother of Isis would have been disingenious. \n\nUS created islamic fundamentalism from its infancy, harbored it, told it to go out and attack the soviets, and then has the audacity to believe they can just drop it and be done with it. And then acted surprised when the dog that they trained to bite anything on sight is biting its hand when they kick it. 
Makes an individual pricetag to "save a life" of 4,666 Dollars. \n\nIf we allow for optimisation, it makes sense.

Their makeup. \n\nTheir hair. \n\nThe way they look in the morning after waking up. 
Witch in Chief. \n\nI am just saying, if you have a state leader that literally empties the prisons to stock the law enforcement system in an occupied country, in true nazi fashion, with moral degenerates of the criminal scum variety, and you never apologize, you never say, "Sorry, we fucked up", you never took back every single medal and honor given for service during irish occupation, and then you have the audacity of going, what, you are not over this, how come, and please, a 48 hour rendition of ding dong the witch is dead is in bad taste, hell, That is your right as an adult country. You are a grown up country. That is within your rights. \n\nBut then, accept that there is a certain percentage of the population that does not feel like they are over this, if there was never an official apology, and if Thatchers corpse has not been cremated and given to gorillas to provide them with diarreah. \n\nAnd if those were the people you treated like Bobby Sands, and these were the people where the only people who stood up for them were treated like Bobby Sands, .... Then sory, you knew this was coming. They were never going to think of the Queen Mother as their hero. They will think rather fondly of the people like Bobby Sands. \n\nI mean, I am serious. You label everyone who stood up for them a terrorist, and go, so, you gonna like England of what, and then act surprised when shit goes wrong and they decide, hey, that Fucker that hurt all those people, you know, the one we kind of thought that he went a bit overboard and excessive? Exactly, how about we shove this in the english ugly mug, see how they like it, they seem easily triggered these days. \n\nThis is the essence of being British. \n\nNot going under when everyone tells you to stop doing that but doing your own thing. \n\nThat is why you have tea kettles in tanks. \n\nThat is why you have regiments attatched to decrepit Monarchs. \n\nFeck, that is why you have Monarchs, when everyone except a few crazies abolished Monarchy long ago.\n\nI would call you, a nation of spite. \n\nEveryone would break down crying, apologizing, changing... not you. You stand fast, do your own thing. Keep calm, carry on. From the time when you were burned out by the blitz, to the time over that thing with the ashes, to you leaving the EU. You do your own thing. \n\nAnd this is why I have a problem with you losing your shit over Sinn Fein. \n\nWhen you push the people to a wall, and you leave them no room to breath, and you oppress them, and then suddenly go, that was all back then, mate, you allright? ....\n\nThese people grew up back then. These people lived back then. They grew up under oppression. They grew up knowing the guy who was registered to beat their f*cking head in with a nightstick was a c*nt with a crime spree worse then anything, that was spared prison if he dished his anger out on irish women and children, hell, what do you expect? \n\nIn my estimate, take her children. Her children will be able to sit on the same table, and actually go, yea, allright, that was my granddads war. That was stuff that is ancient. We are the new generation, let bygones be bygones. \n\nI am not saying digging up Thatchers grave, burning her rotting corpse in a Hazmat chamber , collecting the ashes, blessing them, mixing them wih bananas, feeding them to stray dogs who then get set loose on irish ground so that her vile darkness at least has some positiv aspects as fertilizer, while live streaming the process to the internet and a demonstration in front of the house of lords with a musical choir rendition of ding dong the witch is dead and having it on her death day is the solution to all your problems with Ireland.\n\nNot saying at all that this will solve all the problems between England and Ireland. \n\nBut it would be a good start. \n\nAnd if you want to argue otherwise, think back to Englands long history of holding grudges, of steadily holding to tradition, despite what everyone says. Think of the ashes cricket match series, and how you year after year come back, even if you sucked the last year, and try again, not to give that ruddy bastard of a former colony the satisfaction of giving up. \n\nDon't take it as a slight to your honor. Take it as a challenge. \n\nBecause if France and Germany can make up to the point where the french president can shake hands with the german counterpart and not burst into spontaneous cussing matches, it should be easy for England and Ireland. 
Vaping.... not really the most healthy thing ever. 
And this is why history sucks. \n\nOur german history teacher started his lesson, with all of us being around 14, with the quote, "And if you stare into the abyss...", that he wrote on the blackboard. \n\nWe had , up unill then, been taught nazi germany twice yearly, from the age we were 8. Seeing how he wanted to make a splash, he had two projectors from the art department in the room. \n\nThe entire hour, he just clicked away, photo after photo, of the concentration camps, of the bombed out cities, and of the dropsites. Without a single sound or comment, just a few seconds to see the picture, then the next one. First the corpse mounds of the germans, then the corpse mounds of the japanese. Then the burned out shells of one, then the other. then the horrifying survivors of one, then the survivors of the other. \n\nHe later on, in private, said that had he talked just a single word of how he really felt, he would have been let go. I kind of feel the same way. 
Eeeeh....\n\nLook towards the controversy of the Shah of Persiah, when America pulled a Putin and tried to instate a dictator in place, disrespecting the people of the country and what they wanted. The people of the country then went for the religious fucktard out of a sense of self-determination. \n\nIt is allmost like they had an idea what would happen when they stuffed what they wanted down the throat of the people, and then expected the people to just go with it. \n\n
By the same logic, have you ever seen a policeman being posecuted for shit they did? \n\nI mean, they have undercover policemen who went into the eco scene, fathered children, and then suddenly went back to service as usual. \n\nYou have CIA / NSA people who torture prisoners of war in black site prisons. \n\nYou have an acting CIA chief do a bold faced lie when questioned by congress about the extend of the surveillance programm. \n\nNothing happened. \n\nYou still have to ask yourself if there are two standarts of justice? 
Then, lets prosecute the girl for the production of child porn. 360 Years for making child porn should be good. 
same wrongness. \n\nGerman. \n\nNever pretended to be anything otherwise. \n\nAnd just the same as you, I am opposed to anti democratic maneuveriung, but I am also opposed to bold faced hypocris, and double standarts. \n\nAnd if the americans hack mamma merkels handy in search of nudes, They could have just asked.

If I found out that my city was screwed out of a massive opportunity for a financial economic boost (this happens to every city that makes the Playoffs in any sport) I would start a revolution to boycott the NFL, or at least have them acknowledge their lies.\n\nIf they've been scripting professional sports, then all the drama they have advertised has been deceitful.  Anyone who has ever paid for a ticket to a game or spent money on the NFL store would be entitled to a class action lawsuit judgement.\n\nIf they have rigged the game, they are guilty of fraud on one of the most grandiose scales imaginable.  We are talking BILLIONS.

I like how the title literally puts Fake News after CNN like its now part of their name...

So, they can "report" on bs all day long and claim that no one Don Lemon has ever known has ever worked for a fake news enterprise.
I don't think its necessarily "rich by religious affiliation" as much as it is "rich by association"\n\nSo, I think we are on the same page there.

 > I bet you like fox news\n\nI hate all MSM outlets.  \n\n> If you had actually watched this \n\nThe point is, the guy was trying to express his opinion of WHY he thought CNN and what they were discussing is fake news (Which Don actually said he would allow the guy to do) but he must've gotten a chirp in his ear to end it before his job was at stake.

I don't give a fuck if this guy is a democrat or republican... death penalty 
To answer question #1, its not always the right play to shove AK/QQ to a 4-bet.  Stack/pot sizes definitely play a factor.  There is no point in shoving to potentially "steal" a 4x+blinds with AK or QQ... you'd be wasting the value.\n\nAlso, it looks like you got yourself into trouble sticking around after the re-raise with 56hh.\n\nThe second hand, I'm not so sure I can get away from the aces there.. especially with your broadway draw tacked on the turn.  The only thing I could see doing differently is maybe raising more preflop.\n\n

Fair enough.  I guess what I meant is that they [the players] are unknowingly or knowingly pawns in a scheme much bigger than their own paychecks.  \n\nThe amount of money that is put into the NFL is why I think it should be discussed here.  \n\n > Whether it's rigged or not, I have no idea - but I wouldn't be surprised\n\nThis almost sounds like you wouldn't care if you found out it was rigged.\n\n

Right, which is why I suspect the players to be oblivious to the corruption within.  Many players in the past have spoken out about officiating and are fined by the league for defamation.  \n\nI also believe there are conspiracies surrounding the deaths of Steve McNair and Sean Taylor.\n\nTo be clear, I think the players are pawns in a larger plot to profit.  The referees literally can control the outcome of any game.  Why wouldn't they or someone with massive influence take advantage of that power for personal gain?\n\n
So, now that its over... Who is going to go clean that shit up?

SuperBowl Discussion:  The NFL is rigged; the players are paid actors, acting out 'plays' given to them by their coordinators.  Referees can call holding on either team on any play, and have indisputable video evidence of the foul.  The linemen's job is basically to grab a hold of the dude in front of you and manipulate the player in your favor.  Additionally, judgement calls by officials (most importantly illegal contact and pass interference) CANNOT be reviewed.  This is absolute madness.\n\nWhy don't people talk about this more in the sub?  Sure, I don't have any hard evidence... but come on, its like the new age WWE.

I want to point something out which definitely stands out within this post. The founder of black list Franklin has been here fighting off negative comments trying to explain himself & defending his organization with persistence. This doesn't look good for yourself or your site. If people are coming here with similar stories about your services & you're here trying to patch it all up, it gives more credibility to the negative aspect of it. If things with your site were all sunshine & rainbows then people wouldn't be here trading these lackluster reviews about what you promise people you're gonna do in exchange for cash. Also I wouldn't doubt you're using multiple accounts as sock puppets to praise yourself & upvote your propaganda. How about instead of being here acting as a PR manager for your institution, you actually hire some real professionals & come through with results for the people who are putting the work into sending you their scripts? This is awful in more ways than one.

Get this guy in touch with Marvel studios ASAP pls thx
I miss the days when the media used to allow me to draw my own conclusions with the material they presented to me, now they literally tell me how I'm supposed to feel about any issue before I can think for myself. WTF happened to this country?
U don't know what ur talking about, Pablo himself literaly handed out stacks of money to a line of poor people by the sidewalks of Medellin, this was a regular thing for him, YouTube it because this was filmed
This girl is too meta
I his defense, he posted when I hadn't inlcuded the link
OMG.... WTF
Is this bitch auditioning for Insane Clown Posse? 
I wouldn't touch this girl with a kleenex
Who?
I think they nailed it, they wanted to show you related imagery from the drug culture so when you see it next time you relate it to death

WOW, thank you for sharing your experience. Myself & a couple of friends were thinking about submitting our scripts to blcklist since they seem to advertise it as a good way to get the ball rolling on your career. However now after reading this post, it confirms to me & plenty of doubtful others that the site does engage itself into deceitful practices & scam like methods to put their hand in your pocket. If Im gonna pay someone to read my script I expect a full dissection of the things that are working & aren't working. Half assed analysis won't fly with me & my cash. Makes me actually angry to hear people aren't only wasting their time & money waiting for this site to come through with what they are actually supposed to do ( an actual read done right... since they are getting paid for it ) but also have been receiving these incomplete reviews. Shame on everyone involved. SMH.

Same person I complain to when they do the exact same thing now, while I have to pay their fee involuntarily?\n\nAlso, what if the Giant Alien Mothership emerges from behind the sun and blasts the planet with it's freeze-o ray?  I'm not going to support a shit system based on a bunch of extreme hypotheticals postulated about its competition.  No system at all can survive having extreme hypotheticals flung at it.\n\nIn our current system, the government with vested interests ruins my life, family, throws me in jail, and kills me if I resist.  I'm ready for change.\n\nWhy support that archaic way, over trying something modern that wasn't invented back in the 1910s?\n\nWe've done it this old way for a century now.  Time to step in the 00's.  The old white marxists are dead, and their firstborn children are dying out.
Need to be careful, because it's not imagination, it's projection.
By charging people a miniscule fraction of what they pay for firefighting in taxes for a subscription to monitor their homes for fire safety.  \n\nBuilt into the price would be wireless smoke detectors that would call my service immediately when tripped.  Because, you know, fighting a very small fire would be a lot more profitable to me than having to bring down a four-alarm blaze.
The difference between Trump and everyone else who ran is that Trump is "probably" and everyone else was "for sure."
Look at the replies.  Their monopoly is lying in pieces and they're buzzing around like wasps around a broken hive.
It'll happen... but it'll happen within an adaptive timescale.  We'll go through a whole generation of babysitting machines, and then in 50 years, maybe, there will be some non-babysitting machines... but because it won't have happened so fast to be disruptive, it'll all settle out.\n\nYou can't plan that far into the future.  People might decide they want artisan things created by woodworkers, for instance.  These things tend to work out.\n\nIf you read Kurt Vonnegut's "Player Piano" it's a good example of automation hysteria-- in the 1950s.  But the whole book didn't take into consideration the fact that new inventions create new maintenance.
I think it's fascinating how the media managed to make people *at ACORN advising a pimp how to get benefits for his underage prostitutes* be all about how the film was edited.\n\nIt's an incredible study in persuasion and influence.
Your first job, when you start selling this amazing new lightbulb, will be to fend off the hordes of lawyers and congressmen who descend to inform you that you are violating code 27a, subsection 3, part IIa, which protects the consumer, except from certain companies who are exempt from it.

>Fighting fire with fire or corruption with anti-freedom laws is the wrong way.\n\nIn WW1, Germany would never have agreed to stop using poison gas if England and France hadn't responded in kind and showed them exactly how bad it actually was.\n\nIf nobody responds in kind, the person willing to resort to the worst methods just maintains an advantage.
Don't forget he also established the precedent of requiring citizens to purchase a product from a private company or else be fined/jailed.

Humans respond to stimulus.  "Infinite resources" and "shortage" are stimuli.\n\nSo you think humans are computer minded vulcans that always act purely rationally?
They will be held to their own standards.  It's not going to be "follow the constitution" for libertarians and conservatives and "do whatever the hell you want" for democrats and socialists.
>They only hear what fits their narrative.\n\nNo, it's more like what Scott Adams says; they're so invested in their narrative that if it's not true, they're morons.  \n\nNobody wants to think of himself as a moron, therefore beating up a blonde girl Trump supporter is not violence.\n\nSo they _do_ hear the other side, it just has to be redefined away... otherwise they're bad people.\n\nEventually it gets worked to "you guys not carrying me to my health care appointment in a gilded sedan chair is violence."
All switch arguments invalidated by the democrats keeping a KKK grand wizard in office as an esteemed member until he died in office in 2010.\n\nNo parsing will erase that.  I don't remember Strom Thurmond being a KKK grand wizard.
Let's not play around.  He gets "forgiven" because he's a democrat.  And that's the only reason.  So word games are fun, but they're not reality.  One party kept a KKK grand wizard in office until he died.  That was the democrats.  There was no switch.  Period.
Humans respond to stimulus.  "Infinite resources" and "shortage" are stimuli.
>...is the reason why we have beautiful places like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon still. Without him they would have been destroyed most likely.\n\nBack in college (90s), my environmental science professor told me that the entire flora of Yellowstone today is different than it was a century ago-- literally an extinction level event.  \n\nThe reason is that Yellowstone's original flora was reliant on FIRE for reproduction.  Seed pods that only open from fire, etc.  After it became a national park, the government suppressed the fires... which wiped out the native plants and changed it over to new species-- universally.\n\nThe "natural beauty" of Yellowstone that you see today is not the same one that Roosevelt observed and vowed to protect.  The moment he signed the order to protect it, it was doomed.
That's a beta revenge.  Trump is alpha, he gets his revenge face to face.
Welfare is pretty evil.  It makes people actually consider abortion as the more moral option.  Let's end it, it causes too much stress.
Ask Robert Byrd.  Last Klansman in the senate died in office in 2010... as a high ranking heavily esteemed mentor democrat.
Simple, I'll just form a new fire department next to them, charge a penny less for rates, and steal all their customers.
From Wikipedia:    \n*Regulatory capture is a form of government failure that occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.*\n\nYou have it backwards.  Regulatory capture is government corruption, not business corruption.  It's essentially gov't regulators saying "cut me in and I'll make sure you can drill in the nature preserves and nobody else can."  Another form: "nice business you got there, be a shame if something were to happen to it," a-la the Microsoft lawsuit.
Before he can say or do *anything* about this, he's got to get his assassination proof force-field out of beta.
Yeah... it's more like setting out bait to prove there's mice in the house.  The bait didn't create the mice.

Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, Rule #13:\n*“Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy.*\n\nThis generation of lefties is really inept, though.  Castro, FDR's and Stalin's generation were masters, these guys are like engineering kids playing with lego Mindstorms.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see what happens when the true socialist grand masters all die off, and only the wind-up toys are left.
That's just the cover story to make everyone accept future fraud.
Tactics are not principles.  Keep your principles and you can use whatever tactics you want, even the left's.
But it *does* mean they will look legit, and then drop reporting on it when "their guy" is in office-- which will look legit.  So what we're doing by praising them right now is giving them cred that they can expend as propaganda later.
If there's one set of rules for one type of person, and another set of rules for other people, that's pretty much a conspiracy of some sort, right?  Especially if there's a coordinated media attack on one, and coordinated media silence on the other?
Being a hypocrite isn't a conspiracy, it's just human... but when 50 people are hypocrites in one direction that serves the purposes of all of them, I'd go ahead and call that a conspiracy.
The Difference: The media will oppose Trump.
Then there would be something else.  Trying to manage complex, chaotic systems, ESPECIALLY with government employees, is a losing proposition.  How many years did they spend removing, then reintroducing, wolves to Yellowstone?
But it IS interesting that you can make a movie like "Loose Change" without the elite getting excited, but start investigating pizza and the literal hitmen come ouit.
I actually agree!  But let's everyone be ready for the lie campaign.
Your can't pirate from socialists.  You just redistribute.\n\nMake them live up to their own standards.
When John McCain and Hillary Clinton are both against you, when George Soros and the Koch brothers are both against you... you're outside.  When Paul Ryan spends the last month declaiming you so that the opposition party has the win, you're outside.\n\nAnd it was a huge, overwhelming wave of fed-up Republicans that made him the nominee.  Luckily, Republicans don't have a superdelegate system, or it never would have happened.
Yes, one tends to get very prickly about people who say "see this gun?  Give me 40% of the fruits of your labor."  You know, keep your government hands off my body (and the work I do with it)...\n\n
The issue is more that, they thought they knew what they were doing, took over, smart guys that they were, then screwed it all up.\n\nNature is too complex a system to trust to government workers.  If you want "no building" then buy up the land and sit on it, like Nature Conservancy used to do before they went money crazy.\n
He attempted to beg the question.  He only did this because seemingly infinite resources in society changed the way he perceives cause and effect. ;)
Microsoft lawsuit.  I repeat, Microsoft lawsuit.  The big, glaring, counter-example to your theory.  Microsoft lawsuit.  The one domino that brings down your whole construct.\n\n**Microsoft before lawsuit:** 1 lobbyist, no gov't involvement, just some nerds playing computers.     \n**Microsoft after lawsuit:** an army of lobbyists, total government involvement, lots of donations.\n\nRegulatory capture is basically "pay to play."  Oh, you're a big business and you're not paying us to do things for you?  Be a shame if you had a big lawsuit that threatened to break up your company.

That was because we had insider, same-team presidential candidates, over and over again.  Maybe if there was, say, some outsider with brass balls and a willingness to take on insurmountable odds and the elite both, he would start prosecuting them and things would change a little.
The laws that made propaganda illegal were repealed under Obama.  We could bring them back.
If it was corporate media, they'd chase money, not ideology.  They're not, they're deliberately alienating a great deal of money, and sacrificing ALL their ratings, just for the purpose of their ideology.\n\nIt's the same as with Hollywood-- if Hollywood was about money, not ideology, there'd have been a hundred "Passion of the Christ" style biblical movies... but they're not about money.\n\nIt's the leftist media.  Or the Democrat media, at a minimum.\n\n
It helps if you think of the snowflakes as victims of a massive psychological campaign.\n\nPolitical marketers probe them for their weaknesses and basically hypnotize an obsessive-compulsive syndrome into them.
Nothing like Pizzagate!  9/11 theories flourished, and there was no censorship or shutdowns of discussion.  Either Pizzagate is more sensitive or Bush's government was a lot less tyrannical.
And instead of cool shades it should have a hole in its tongue.
Disagree.  The opposition he faces, and the opposition everyone who supports him faces, in the established media, in established national politics, and in the establishment worldwide, indicates that nobody serious expected him to win, and they're *quite* unhappy.
Ahem.  Need to take two of theirs.
This is really going to be a different kind of President for the American people.
U R Wrong\n\nYou're essentially saying "since the government didn't fund video games, video games never got invented."\n\nI assume you haven't met any tech people, ever.\n\nWithout government to make it top secret, any number of enterprising young guys would have invented packet systems.  Putting the government into it just meant we all got locked into the ultra-shitty TCP/IP in addition to getting it all marked top secret hands-off-for-normals during the 70's and 80's.\n\nNot only does my point stand, but it is actually bolstered by your counter.
You never see these two together.

it's not a free market when the government literally takes 40% of your earnings and gives it as funding to your direct competitors.
There's no such thing as infinite resources, true (this is why lefty stuff is so insane).  However, there IS such thing as the PERCEPTION of infinite resources, which to the brain is the same thing.\n\nWhere's food come from, does it come from hunting and stalking an animal across a couple hours/days, or does it come from walking into a store and picking up a package wrapped in nice clean plastic?  Perception of infinite resources.

I'll add to your pain: Seven years ago, you could have dropped everything and gone to live in a shack in the woods somewhere and been free of all this.  Not any more, you have to buy health insurance. :)\n\nBut that said... I'm a computer programmer, arduino maker, and generalized mechanic.  There is no such thing right now as a machine with a microprocessor and moving parts that will not need 2 babysitters at all times.  \n\nAll the automation optimism you're reading right now is actually a marketing ploy to attract venture capital.  Until there's a currently unknown discovery, all this stuff is just cool facebook videos and exciting ted talks from CEOs seeking to up their stock value without producing anything.\n
\n\nCase in point: Estab. Republicans utterly dragging their feet and worrying sick to a media audience about repealing Obamacare, or tax cuts.  They do NOT want to do this, they will resist it every step of the way.
That would be a good job for government.  We both pay them a fee to enforce the contract (with guns).  We don't pay them a fee to put up a shitty road well behind schedule and over budget.\n\nAnd it's all voluntary and no "pay or go to jail/die" has to enter the equation at all in any form.
Nope.  He is a KKK member.   He is a lifelong democrat.  Everything absolutely unchanged, just hidden better and candy coated now, because for a while people got too smart and new tactics were needed.
THIS... people who are disillusioned with organized religion need to look into the mother of all faiths.  \n\nWhat if I told you the whole civilized world used to practice a religion with no inconsistency, no "guilting," and you could apply scientific method to prove some of the tenets (go ahead, try surrounding yourself with druj and dispassionately observe what happens).\n\nLurkers, look up Zoroastrianism, and enter a different kind of rabbit hole.
This.  All these rules to hurt the big banks are like when fishing companies catch dolphins in their tuna nets.  You're trying to catch the big banks--and you don't even put a scratch on their lifestyle-- but you end up drowning all the mom & pops.
"Right now" is always 1968 to the left, man.
Whether you believe it or not, it's 100% *absolutely clear* that the world elites believe there's something out there, and it can be touched by cutting and "eating the pain."\n\n

Shit compared to what would evolve from a group of people trying to out-compete eachother, yes, absolutely.\n\nImagine a world where the only allowed phone was an iPhone.  All your headphones just went obsolete.  And the OS upgrade just slowed your device down 90%.  And that's your only choice.
Microsoft used to be pretty good.  They were devoted to computers exclusively and had one afterthought lobbyist for their company in Washington.\n\nThen the government got this idea that it was a monopoly to bundle a browser with an operating system.  Microsoft had to devote a lot of their income and design energy over to lobbying.  Google how many lobbyists Microsoft has now.\n\nAs some point, we the people are going to have to accept that WE are responsible for the nasty company culture, as long as we allow politicians to enforce pay to play schemes that turn companies from "please the customer" endeavors to "fund the politicians" endeavors.
Have you still--still, yet-- not learned that putting the government in charge of anything is to turn it all to shit?
Obviously with fewer customers I will not need as much equipment or staff!  It all evens out.
Never Waste time or money doing the right thing, son.   That's daddy soros' secret to success.
If they switched, why did robert Byrd, a kkk Grand wizard, die in office as a highly esteemed democrat as recently as 2010?\n\nAlso if there was a switch why do Republicans not love FDR and Democrats not love Calvin coolidge?\n\nThe switch story is pure memory hole bullshit.
Instead of demanding the chains be put on those that don't wear them, how about demand your own chains be removed as well?
I dunno if you can be a "good hearted socialist."  The whole "I get a chunk of the proceeds of your labor and you just shut up about it" is at odds with "good hearted."

I keep thinking... for years, they told us fat, meat, and cholesterol were poison, so we'd eat bread and sawdust while they kept the rich good food for themselves.\n\nFor years they told us that men and women were exactly the same creature, so we'd end up with a divorce war while they kept their families whole and accumulated wealth.\n\nAnd now I have this little insane voice wondering if they're hammering into us that the world is a rational, scientific place... while they reserve all the magic and contact with higher powers for themselves.\n\nAffecting your mental health?

The "New" part might have something to do with that
From this race consciousness came a fresh interest in the Holy Land. It was an ideal rather than a politico-nationalist interest - a desire to preserve and cherish the great monument of the departed national glories. It took the practical form of projects for improving the circumstances of the local Jews by means of schools, and for reviving something of the old social condition of Judea by the establishment of agricultural colonies. In this work Sir Moses Montefiore, the Rothschild family, and the Alliance Israelite Universelle were conspicuous. More or less passively, however, the older nationalism still lived on - especially in lands where Jews were persecuted - and it became strengthened by the revived race consciousness and the new interest in the Holy Land. Christian Millenarians also helped to keep it alive. Lord Ashley, afterwards Lord Shaftesbury, Colonel Gawler, Mr Walter Cresson, the United States consul at Jerusalem, Mr James Finn, the British consul, Mr Laurence Oliphant and many others organized and supported schemes for the benefit of the Jews of the Holy Land on avowedly Restoration grounds. Another vivifying element was the reopening of the Eastern Question and the championship of oppressed nationalities in the East by the Western Powers. In England political writers were found to urge the re-establishment of a Jewish state under British protection as a means Of assuring the overland route to India (Hollingsworth, Jews in Palestine, 1852). Lord Palmerston was not unaffected by this idea (Finn, Stirring Times, vol. i. pp. 106-112), and both Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury supported Mr Laurence Oliphant in his negotiations with the Porte for a concession which was to pave the way to an autonomous Jewish state in the Holy Land. In 1854 a London Jew attempted to float a company "for the purpose of enabling the descendants of Israel to obtain and cultivate the Land of Promise" (Hebrew Observer, 12th April). In 1876 the publication of George Eliot's Daniel Deronda gave to the Jewish nationalist spirit the strongest stimulus it had experienced since the appearance of Sabbatai Zevi.\n\nIt was not, however, until the spread of anti-Semitic doctrines through Europe made men doubt whether the Mendelssohnian denationalization of Judaism possessed the elements of permanency that the Jewish nationalist spirit reasserted itself in a practical form. As long as the anti-Semites were merely polemical, the nationalists were mute, but when in Russia their agitation took the form of massacres and spoliation, followed by legislation of medieval harshness, the nationalist remedy offered itself. In 1882 several pamphlets were published by Jews in Russia, advocating the restoration of the Jewish state. They found a powerful echo in the United States, where a young Jewish poetess, Miss Emma Lazarus, passionately championed the Zionist cause in verse not unworthy. of Jehuda Halevi. But the movement did not limit itself to literature. A society, "Chovevi Zion," was formed with the object of so extending and methodizing the establishment of agricultural colonies in Palestine as to make the eventual acquisition of the country by the Jews possible. From the beginning it was a great success, and branches, or "tents" as they were called, were established all over the world. At the same time two other great schemes for rescuing the Jewish people from oppression were brought before the public. Neither was Zionist, but both served to encourage the Zionist cause. One was due to the initiative of Mr Cazalet, a financier who was interested in the Euphrates Valley, Railway project. With the assistance of Mr Laurence Oliphant he proposed that the concession from the Porte should include a band of territory two miles wide on each side of the railway, on which Jewish refugees from Russia should be settled. Unfortunately the scheme failed. The other was Baron de Hirsch's colossal colonization association (see Hirsch, Maurice De). This was neither political nor Zionist, but it was supported by a good many members of the "Chovevi Zion," among them Colonel Goldsmid, on the ground that it might result in the training of a large class of Jewish yeomen who would be invaluable in the ultimate settlement of Palestine. (Interview in Daily Graphic, 10th March 1892.) None of these projects, however, proved sufficiently inspiring to attract the great mass of Jewish nationalists. The Chovevi Zion was too timid and prosaic; the Hirsch scheme did npt directly appeal to their strongest sympathies. In 1897 a striking change manifested itself. A new Zionist leader arose in the person of a Viennese journalist and playwright, Dr Theodore Herzl (1860-1904). The electoral successes of the anti-Semites in Vienna and Lower Austria in 1895 had impressed him with the belief that the Jews were unassimilable in Europe, and that the time was not far distant when they would be once more submitted to civil and political disabilities. The Hirsch scheme did not, in his view, provide a remedy, as it only transplanted the Jews from one uncongenial environment to another. He came to the conclusion that the only solution of the problem was the segregation of the Jews under autonomous political conditions. His first scheme was not essentially Zionist. He merely called for a new exodus, and was ready to accept any grant of land in any part of the world that would secure to the Jews some form of self-government. The idea was not new. In 1566 Don Joseph Nasi had proposed an autonomous settlement of Jews at Tiberias, and had obtained a grant of the city from the Sultan for the purpose. In 1652 the Dutch West India Company in Curacao, in 1654 Oliver Cromwell in Surinam, and in 1659 the French West India Company at Cayenne had attempted similar experiments. Marshal de Saxe in 1749 had projected the establishment of a Jewish kingdom in South America, of which he should be sovereign; and in 1825 Major M. M. Noah purchased Grand Island, in the river Niagara, with a view to founding upon it a Jewish state. All these projects were failures. Dr Herzl was not slow to perceive that without an impulse of real enthusiasm his scheme would share the fate of these predecessors. He accordingly resolved to identify it with the nationalist idea. His plan was set forth in a pamphlet, entitled The Jewish State, which was published in German, French and English in the spring of 1896. It explained in detail how the new exodus was to be organized and how the state was to be managed. It was to be a tribute-paying state under the suzerainty of the Sultan. It was to be settled by a chartered company and governed by an aristocratic republic, tolerant of all religious differences. The Holy Places were to be exterritorialized. The pamphlet produced a profound sensation. Dr Herzl was joined by a number of distinguished Jewish literary men, among whom were Dr Max Nordau and Mr Israel Zangwill, and promises of support and sympathy reached him from all parts of the world. The haute finance and the higher rabbinate, however, stood aloof.\n\nThe most encouraging feature in Dr Herzl's scheme was that the Sultan of Turkey appeared favourable to it. The motive of his sympathy has not hitherto been made known. The Armenian massacres had inflamed the whole of Europe against him, and for a time the Ottoman Empire was in very serious peril. Dr Herzl's scheme provided him, as he imagined, with a means of securing powerful friends. Through a secret emissary, the Chevalier de Newlinsky, whom he sent to London in May 1896, he offered to present the Jews a charter in Palestine provided they used their influence in the press and otherwise to solve the Armenian question on lines which he laid down. The English Jews declined these proposals, and refused to treat in any way with the persecutor of the Armenians. When, in the following July, Dr Herzl himself came to London, the Maccabaean Society, though ignorant of the negotiations with the Sultan, declined to support the scheme. None the less, it secured a large amount of popular support throughout Europe, and in 1910 Zionism had a following of over 300,000 Jews, divided into a thousand electoral districts. The English membership is about 15,000.\n\nBetween 1897 and 1910 the Zionist organization held nine international Congresses. At the first, which met at Basel, a political programme was adopted on the following terms: "Zionism aims at establishing for the Jewish people a publicly and legally assured home in Palestine. For the attainment of this purpose the Congress considers the following means serviceable:\n\n    (1) The promotion of the settlement of Jewish agriculturists, artisans and tradesmen in Palestine.\n    (2) The federation of all Jews into local or general groups, according to the laws of the various countries.\n    (3) The strengthening of the Jewish feeling and consciousness.\n    (4) Preparatory steps for the attainment of those governmental grants which are necessary to the achievement of the Zionist purpose." \n\nSubsequent congresses founded various institutions for the promotion of this programme, notably a People's Bank known as the Colonial Trust, which is the financial instrument of political Zionism, a National Fund for the purchase of land in Palestine and a Palestine Commission with subsidiary societies for the study and improvement of the social and economic condition of the Jews in the Holy Land. For the purposes of these bodies about 400,000 was collected in small sums and invested. Very little practical work of any abiding value, however, was accomplished, and on the political side the career of Zionism had up to the end of 1910 proved a failure.\n

Zionism\n\nZIONISM. One of the most interesting results of the antiSemitic agitation (see Anti-SEMITIsm) has been a strong revival of the national spirit among the Jews in a political form. To this movement the name Zionism has been given. In the same way that anti-Semitism differs from the Jew-hatred of the early and middle ages, Zionism differs from previous manifestations of the Jewish national spirit. It was originally advocated as an expedient without Messianic impulses, and its methods and proposals have remained almost harshly modern. None the less it is the lineal heir of the attachment to Zion which led the Babylonian exiles under Zerubbabel to rebuild the Temple, and which flamed up in the heroic struggle of the Maccabees against Antiochus Epiphanes. Without this national spirit it could, indeed, never have assumed its present formidable proportions. The idea that it is a set-back of Jewish history, in the sense that it is an unnatural galvanization of hopes long since abandoned for a spiritual and cosmopolitan conception of the mission of Israel, is a controversial fiction. The consciousness of a spiritual mission exists side by side with the national idea. The great bulk of the Jewish people have throughout their history remained faithful to the dream of a restoration of their national life in Judea. Its manifestations have suffered temporary modifications under the influence of changing political conditions, and the intensity with which it has been held by individual Jews has varied according to their social circumstances, but in the main the idea has been passionately clung to.\n\nThe contention of some modern rabbis that the national idea. is Messianic, and hence that its realization should be left to the Divine initiative (e.g. Chief Rabbi Adler, Jewish Chronicle, 25th November 18 9 8), is based on a false analogy between the politics of the Jews and those of other oppressed nationalities. As all Hebrew politics were theocratic, the national hope was necessarily Messianic. It was not on that account less practical or less disposed to express itself in an active political form. The Messianic dreams of the Prophets, which form the framework of the Jewish liturgy to this day, were essentially politiconational. They contemplated the redemption of Israel, the gathering of the people in Palestine, the restoration of the Jewish state, the rebuilding of the Temple, and the re-establishment of the Davidic throne in Jerusalem with a prince of the House of David. How little the dispersed Jews regarded this essentially political programme as a mere religious ideal is shown by their attitude towards the pseudo-Messiahs who endeavoured to fulfil it. Bar Cochba (A.D. 117-138) lived at a period when a Jewish national uprising might well have been exclusively political, for the dissolution of the kingdom was 1 Christians of the 4th century removed the name to the S.W. hill, and this tradition has persisted until modern times, when archaeological and topographical evidence has re-identified Sion with the E. hill.\n\nscarcely half a century old, and Palestine still had a large Jewish population. None the less Bar Cochba based his right to lead the Jewish revolt on Messianic claims, and throughout the Roman Empire the Jews responded with enthusiasm to his call. Three centuries later Moses of Crete attempted to repeat Bar Cochba's experiment, with the same results. In the 8th century, when the Jews of the West were sufficiently remote from the days of their political independence to have developed an exclusively spiritual conception of their national identity, the Messianic claims of a Syrian Jew named Serene shook the whole of Jewry, and even among the Jews of Spain there was no hestitation as to whether they had a right to force the hands of Providence. It was the same with another pseudo-Messiah named Abu-Isa Obadia, who unfurled the national banner in Persia some thirty years later.\n\nDuring the middle ages, though the racial character of the Jews was being transformed by their Ghetto seclusion, the national yearning suffered no relaxation. If it expressed itself exclusively in literature, it was not on that account undergoing a process of idealization. (Cf. Abrahams's Jewish Life in the Middle Ages, pp. 24-25.) The truth is that it could not have expressed itself differently. There could have been no abandonment of national hopes in a practical sense, unless the prospect of entering the national life of the peoples among whom they dwelt had presented itself as an alternative. Of this there was not the remotest sign. The absence of militant Zionism during this period is to be accounted for partly by the want of conspicuous pseudo-Messiahs, and partly by the terror of persecution. Unlike the modern Greeks, the medieval Jews could expect no sympathy from their neighbours in an agitation for the recovery of their country. One may imagine what the Crusaders would have thought of an international Jewish conspiracy to recapture Jerusalem. In the 15th century the aversion from political action, even had it been possible, must have been strengthened by the fact that the Grand Signor was the only friend the Jews had in the world. The nationalist spirit of the medieval Jews is sufficiently reflected in their liturgy, and especially in the works of the poet, Jehuda Halevi. It is impossible to read his beautiful Zionide without feeling that had he lived another twenty years he would have gladly played towards the pseudo-Messiah David Alroy (circa 1160) the part that Akiba played towards Bar Cochba.\n\nThe strength of the nationalist feeling was practically tested in the 16th century, when a Jewish impostor, David Reubeni (circa 1530), and his disciple, Solomon Molcho (1501-1532), came forward as would-be liberators of their people. Throughout Spain, Italy and Turkey they were received with enthusiasm by the bulk of their brethren. In the following century the influence of the Christian Millenarians gave a fresh impulse to the national idea. Owing to the frenzy of persecution and the apocalyptic teachings of the Chiliasts, it now appeared in a more mystical form, but a practical bias was not wanting. Menasseh ben Israel (1604-1657) co-operated with English Millenarians to procure the resettlement of the Jews in England as a preliminary to their national return to Palestine, and he regarded his marriage with a scion of the Davidic family of Abarbanel as justifying the hope that the new Messiah might be found among his offspring. The increasing dispersion of the Marranos or crypto-Jews of Spain and Portugal through the Inquisition, and the persecution of the Jews in Poland, deepened the Jewish sense of homelessness the while the Millenarians encouraged their Zionist dreams. The Hebraic and Judeophil tendencies of the Puritan revolution in England still further stirred the prevailing unrest, and some Jewish rabbis are said to have visited England in order to ascertain by genealogical investigations whether a Davidic descent could be ascribed to Oliver Cromwell. It only wanted a leader to produce a national movement on a formidable scale. In 1666 this leader presented himself at Smyrna, in the person of a Jew named Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), who proclaimed himself the Messiah. The news spread like wildfire, and despite the opposition of some of the leading rabbis, the Jews everywhere prepared for the journey to Palestine. Not alone was this the case with the poor Jews of Lithuania and Germany, but also with well-to-do communities like those of Venice, Leghorn and Avignon, and with the great Jewish merchants and bankers of Hamburg, Amsterdam and London. Throughout Europe the nationalist excitement was intense. Even the downfall and apostasy of Sabbatai were powerless to stop it. Among the wealthier Jews it partially subsided, but the great bulk of the people refused for a whole century to be disillusionized. A Messianic frenzy seized upon them. Encouraged on the one hand by Christian Millenarians like Pierre Jurien, Oliger Pauli, and Johannes Speeth, pandered to by Sabbataic impostors like Cardoso, Bonafoux, Mordecai of Eisenstadt, Jacob Querido, Judah Chassid, Nehemiah Chayon and Jacob Franks, and maddened by fresh oppressions, they became fanaticized to the verge of demoralization.\n\nThe reaction arrived in 1778 in the shape of the Mendelssohnian movement. The growth of religious toleration, the attempted emancipation of the English Jews in 1753, and the sane Judeophilism of men like Lessing and Dohm, showed that at length the dawn of the only possible alternative to nationalism was at hand. Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786) sought to prepare his brethren for their new life as citizens of the lands in which they dwelt, by emphasizing the spiritual side of Judaism and the necessity of Occidental culture. His efforts were successful. The narrow nationalist spirit everywhere yielded before the hope or the progress of local political emancipation. In 1806 the Jewish Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon virtually repudiated the nationalist tradition. The new Judaism, however, had not entirely destroyed it. It had only reconstructed it on a wider and more sober foundation. Mendelssohnian culture, by promoting the study of Jewish history, gave a fresh impulse to the racial consciousness of the Jews. The older nationalism had been founded on traditions so remote as to be almost mythical; the new race consciousness was fed by a glorious martyr history, which ran side by side with the histories of the newly adopted nationalities of the Jews, and was not unworthy of the companionship.\n

\nIn May 1901 and August 1902 Dr Herzl had audiences of the Sultan Abdul Hamid, and was received with great distinction, but the negotiations led to nothing. Despairing of obtaining an immediate charter for Palestine, he turned to the British government with a view to securing a grant of territory on an autonomous basis in the vicinity of the Holy Land, which would provisionally afford a refuge and a political training-ground for persecuted Jews. His overtures met with a sympathetic reception, especially from Mr Chamberlain, then Colonial Secretary, and Earl Percy, who was Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (October 1902). At first a site for the proposed settlement was suggested in the Sinai peninsula, but owing to the waterless character of the country the project had to be abandoned. Then Mr Chamberlain, who in the interval had paid a visit to Africa, suggested the salubrious and uninhabited highlands of the East Africa Protectorate, and in 1903 the British government formally offered Dr Herzl the Nasin Gishiu plateau, 6000 sq. m. in area. No such opportunity for creating a Jewish self-governing community had presented itself since the Dispersion, and for a moment it seemed as if Zionism were really entering the field of practical politics. Unhappily it only led to bitter controversies, which nearly wrecked the whole movement. The British offer was submitted to the Sixth Congress, which assembled at Basel in August 1903. It was received with consternation and an explosion of wrath by the ultra-nationalist elements, who interpreted it as an abandonment of the Palestine idea. By his personal influence Dr Herzl succeeded in obtaining the appointment of a commission to examine the proposed territory, but its composition was largely nationalist, and in the following year the Congress gladly availed itself of certain critical passages in the report to reject the whole scheme.\n\nMeanwhile Zionism had suffered an irreparable blow by the death of Dr Herzl (1904). He was succeeded by Mr David Wolffsohn, a banker of Cologne, but there was in truth nobody who in ability and personal dignity and magnetism could take his place. The movement was further shaken by the dissensions which followed the rejection of the East African project. Mr Israel Zangwill led an influential minority which combined with certain non-Zionist elements to found a rival organization under the name of the JTO (Jewish Territorial Organization) with a view to taking over the East African offer or to establish an autonomous place of refuge elsewhere. Thus freed from all moderating elements, the Zionists hardened into an exclusively Palestinian body, and under the auspices of Mr Wolffsohn fresh negotiations were opened with the Porte. These, however, were rendered finally hopeless by the Turkish revolution, which postulated a united Ottoman nationality, and resolutely set its face against any extension of the racial and religious autonomies under which the integrity of the Empire had already severely suffered.\n\nDuring 1905-1910, the Jewish national idea, for all practical purposes, was in a state of suspended animation. The recovery of the Holy Land appeared more distant than ever, while even the establishment of an independent or autonomous Jewish state elsewhere, for which the JTO was labouring, had encountered unexpected difficulties. On the rejection of the British offer by the Zionists Mr Zangwill approached the Colonial Office, but he was too late, as the reserve on the Nasin Gishiu plateau had already been officially withdrawn. The JTO then turned its attention to Cyrenaica, and an expedition to examine the country was sent out (1908), but it was not found suitable. A project for combining all the Jewish organizations in an effort to secure an adequate foothold in Mesopotamia in connexion with the scheme for the irrigation of that region was subsequently proposed by Mr Zangwill, but up to January 1911 it had not been found practicable. The JTO, however, did valuable work by organizing an Emigration Regulation Department for deflecting the stream of Jewish emigration from the overcrowded Jewry of New York to the Southern states of the American Union, where there is greater scope for employment under wholesome conditions. For this purpose a fund was formed, to which Mr Jacob Schiff contributed £100,000 and Messrs Rothschild £ 20,000.\n\nAlthough the Zionist organization was numerically strong - indeed, the strongest popular movement Jewish history had ever known - its experience from 1897 to 1910 rendered it very doubtful whether its nationalist aspirations could, humanly speaking, ever be fulfilled. From Turkey, either absolutist or democratic, it appeared hopeless to expect any willing relaxation of the Ottoman hold on Palestine, while in the event of a dissolution of the Empire it was questionable whether Christendom - and especially the Roman and Greek Churches - would permit the Holy Land to pass to the Jews, even though the Holy Places were exterritorialized. Should these obstacles be overcome, still more formidable difficulties would await the Jewish state. The chief of these is the religious question. The state would have to be orthodox or secular. If it were orthodox it would desire to revive the whole Levitical polity, and in these circumstances it would either pass away through internal chaos or would so offend the modern political spirit that it would be soon extinguished from outside. If it were secular it would not be a Jewish state. The great bulk of its supporters would refuse to live in it, and it would ultimately be abandoned to an outlander population consisting of Hebrew Christians and Christian Millenarians.\n\nModern Zionism is vitiated by its erroneous premises. It is based on the idea that antisemitism is unconquerable, and thus the whole movement is artificial. Under the influence of religious toleration and the naturalization laws, nationalities are daily losing more of their racial character. The coming nationality will be essentially a matter of education and economics, and this will not exclude the Jews as such. With the passing away of antisemitism, Jewish nationalism will disappear. If the Jewish people disappear with it, it will only be because either their religious mission in the world has been accomplished or they have proved themselves unworthy of it.\n\nLITERATURE.\n\n    A Zionist bibliography has been published by the Federation of American Zionists.\n    Besides the works already cited in the body of this article, see on the early nationalist movement Graetz, Geschichte der Juden, under the heads of the various pseudo-Messiahs and their adherents.\n    Jewish agricultural colonies will be found discussed very fully in The Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. i. pp. 240-262.\n    For early Zionist projects see Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society, No. 8, pp. 75-118; Laurence Oliphant, Land of Gilead; Mrs Oliphant, Life of Laurence Oliphant, pp. 168 et seq.\n    The Zionist movement since 1895 is fully recorded in its official organ, Die Welt (Vienna).\n    For proceedings of the Congresses see the Official Protocols published for each year by the society "Erez Israel" of Vienna; also Herzl, Der Baseler Congress (Vienna, 1897).\n    On the movement generally, see Herzl's.

I remember my economics 101 teacher *(I learned more from [mises.org](http://www.mises.org) than any of those classes)* preaching to us that companies should be more than just institutions to provide a service, that they should have values and a cause. She was adamantly against the Milton Friedman idea that companies exist to create a better economic system exclusive of beliefs. Kind of a "separation of church and business," if you will.\n\n\nWell, here's a great situation as an example. Lyft could have just been a taxi service and shut up about their personal beliefs, but now they're using their platform to preach their biased views that divide their client base. That's not a very smart way to do business by alienating a portion of your customers. I keep seeing companies create this divide between people further and further, and it's absolutely unprofessional to preach your political views through your platform that you built by simply providing a service people wanted.

Gaddafi was going to break away from the Petrodollar Empire and back their Libyan currency in gold. The geopolitical masters couldn't have that, so they staged an "uprising." Basically had him killed and put in their MB team that would play by the rules. Funny how that's been happening in other nations too with the Arab Spring, Ukraine, and the other "uprisings" that end up in new leaders, and almost happened in Syria. Strange coincidence.

I support Trump, but I don't agree with everything he is doing.

It sharpens us. I don't want us to get to the point where we think he can do no wrong. I think we should be constantly discerning each unique situation at all times.

I cannot stand people that call the situation you described "immigration."\n\n\nThere is no dignity in the situation you described. Basically setting up a welfare state and victim attitude instead of providing an opportunity for immigrants to assimilate into society, be productive, get jobs, start a family, and be a healthy contribution to society. That only happens through vetting and having immigration standards, not opening the floodgates for everyone to take advantage of handouts and giving no voice to the people that have been living there for generations and building that society through their hard work and contributions.\n\n\nThere's no criticism over Switzerland or New Zealand's immigration policies, yet I guarantee it would take me YEARS to pass their high standards. Has nothing to do with race at all, and it makes me sick when everyone makes 99% of all issues today a race issue in their ignorance. It's such a simplistic way of dumbing down any dialogue and thought surrounding any issue - just call it "racist."

Keep in mind he designed his time to explain and define.\n\nAll I know, time is a valuable thing. Watch it fly by as the playback status swings.\n\nWatch it count down to the end of the play, the video then cuts away. \n\nIt's so unreal. \n\nDon't forget to like below. Watch your time right go out the window. \n\nTrying to get subscribers but didn't even know, why I wasted 9 hours just to watch viewers go.
I agree with you. Tariffs aren't as simple as they first sound. A really good writing on this subject is by [Frederic Bastiat titled "The Candle Makers' Petition."](http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html). I hope trump is using these Tariffs as a tool and isn't expecting them to intrinsically be the answer to making our economy better. Maybe he's trying to jump-start manufacturing? But there are many unintended consequences when you take away the division of labor benefits which provide less-costly products from other nations which can produce it more efficiently and then try to produce it in your own nation with less cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Unless we're really at that point where our trade deficit is going to kill our nation and we must become an exporter nation again, no longer enjoying the benefits of a consumer nation. IE: Our petrodollar / greenback / world reserve currency is already F*CKED and we've got to jumpstart this.
Just like in Germany. It's off-limits to talk about. Merkel has blood on her hands.
See that's the thing, *"look at what is happening all over Europe."*\n\n\nNobody in the U.S. knows what has been happening all over Europe. Our propaganda MSM hasn't been covering it. Nobody is talking about it (even people in Germany and Sweden). I didn't even know about it until I heard it on Red Ice Radio. People aren't getting any real information from CNN, NPR, etc. It's being censored. So they can't understand where this comes from because in a sense they've been living under a rock by watching mainstream media.
I think we have enough evidence already at this point on Soros...
We need a **"Comedians against PC Culture"** tour. Bill Burr, Jim Norton, Rich Vos, and Joe Rogan should organize it.\n\nMake it happen!
Or maybe you **assumed** that he's a racist because he's white. So he can't bring up kool-aid anytime he's around someone with darker skin? WTF is that logic? Grow the fuck up. Maybe you're a judgemental prick that needs to stop watching mainstream media propaganda that says everything is RAYSISS RAYSISS RAYSISS!!
He absolutely said it right after she said "I make this dish in the summer." Maybe Reddit is racist for reading too much into kool-aid. \n\nKool-aid is a drink... people drink it in the summer... \n\n\nIs everyone on /r/cringe 12 years old?
I haven't drank that crap since 2009. High Fructose Corn Syrup = diabeetus. Insulin overload.\n\nAt the very least drink soda with real sugar. Then move to stevia-sweetened soda, then move to sparkling flavored water and iced tea.
*"When they go low, we go high!"*\n\nWell they've certainly demonstrated that in the last couple months, haven't they?
Explain how trump is connected to Silsby
You mean like being aggressive toward a nuclear-weapons nation such as Russia and blaming them for multiple events with absolutely no evidence?
Have fun with that worthless Keynesian bullshit you just wasted all of your money and time to become indoctrinated in. Go break a window and help the economy like dumbshit Krugman would advise.
I hate to hold the less-positive view, but there is very little that Trump can do to stop what has already been set in the economy by the Bush and Obama administrations. I'm happy to see the 20,000 DOW, but a lot of it is hype. Trump will be hard pressed to even create 4% growth. The fundamentals still remain, and the Fed is overleveraged. We never fixed the problems in 2008, we just kicked the can down the road and delayed it. This mofo is coming down, and it won't be pretty. We are 100% in a bubble in real estate and the stock market. It's too irreversible at this point. I'm actually kind of surprised that Trump was calling that it was a bubble before the election, but recently praised DOW 20,000 in his Tweets, because you know he will take the blame if it crashes. He should have instead pointed out the fundamental issues that he inherited.\n\n\nAs for jobs, I'm definitely for Trump bringing them back and reversing NAFTA/TPP, but it can take a long long time for the new companies to be built, and it will take more of a guarantee for them in the long term to actually move their companies back. It also takes a long time for a profit to be seen. So the fruit of that won't be seen for a long time, but at least we're moving in that direction.
You can't fully trust anything 501(c)3. The true church isn't a building, it's the body of believers. Church buildings are a nice place to gather, but too many are corporate and institutional in the way they view everything.
Same people behind Todd and Clare dating website?
I can't stand it. Not only is /all and /front clearly biased and being blatantly manipulated by Reddit, but the people commenting on these fake news posts are so ignorant and refuse to educate themselves on what's going on in the world around them. Anything that's not on their precious propaganda mainstream news they think is a "conspiracy theory."\n\n This website absolutely disgusts me and I would never visit it again if it weren't for /r/the_donald .
This is a crazy season. Literally everything the anti-trump propaganda tries to push it comes back and bites them threefold. Thrice-damned fools!
Am I the only one getting Pandora advertisements based on things I've spoken about but not actually browsed? I went to Taco Bell for the first time in years, and suddenly got a Taco Bell ad on Pandora. I started watching "The Expanse" on SciFi, and next day got an ad for new episodes. Stuff that hasn't been linked to my browsing in any way, shape, or form.
The collusion between the media and shadow government is so obvious at this point. Anyone who doesn't see it has their head far far up their ass. 
So tell the government to stop backing them, Pocahontas. If the banks offered student loans at their own risk, they'd be out of business. That should tell you something's wrong with their existence.
Taking time off from telling parents how to raise their own kids, eh?
*"We need fuckinnnn... white people to fuckinnnn... give us money."* OMG the idiocy of that worthless tick. \n\nAlso, I thought calling BLM a terrorist organization was a bit extreme at first, but this is definitely conspiracy to commit crimes and cause unrest. 
You know why it's not a huge story.
Todd and Clare ring a bell?
After Obama's administration funded "moderate rebels," to think that now we have to go to war against ISIS in Syria to defeat them, and yet allow Syrians to freely travel into the heart of the U.S. is **INSANE!!!** What kind of dumbass Country would allow their potential enemies right in?\n\n\nAfter Hillary f*cked up Libya, we're supposed to let Libyans come here freely? You created this, Hillary.\n\n\nThey started this bullshit and now Trump has to temporarily close the incoming travel while we fight it. Who has ever heard of going to war with groups in a nation, but letting them freely travel into your Country? Hell, I wish we could allow them to immigrate here. I'm not just being a dick, but I recognize the reality and what's necessary. It's just too bad the previous administrations were warmongering assholes and bombed their homes and cities and funded their most violent "moderate" groups with tanks and guns and weapons. Unfortunately that's the reality they left with Trump that *none* of these protestors criticized at the time becase their heads were up their asses listening to **N**ational **P**ropaganda **R**adio.\n\n\nI'm tired of this bullshit about "refugees." Refugees aren't 100% late-20's muslim men. Refugees are women, children, even Christians. Where are they? Who cared about the Christians while the "moderate" rebels were slaughtering them in Syria? Did NPR do a story about them? F*ck no. It makes me sick the way the left tries to pull heartstrings at a time of relentless attacks.
I don't know man, I think we'd all get along better if Calexit happened. Just make travel and trade to and from California open, but write up a special clause for them to elect their own leader to stand in place of the Federal level.\n\nOh wait.. but that means I'd be supporting Russia now, doesn't it? :-P
It's used as a means to keep people in power in line because they can always be blackmailed by it.\n\nPeople thought the Catholic church problem was just a "conspiracy theory" too before it was all revealed.
very nice\n
Get the American people some help. Can't talk about anything without someone bringing up race.
Bigots hate him!
I have to say it - can we please get a web savvy Pede to help them with their website's design?
That's what it says when I try to go to this image too, but several other imgur images are working. I guess only SELECT images are "overloaded."
Yikes, Boulder! Even my liberal friends in other parts of Colorado are like "Yeah, Boulder people are a bit too 'out there.' " There are some great small businesses, but that place is like a Rockies Sedona.
Absolutely convinced of this. Reddit is not grassroot. Reddit is not organic. Reddit is not transparent. Reddit isn't autonomous and controlled by its users. Reddit is not a reflection of true popular opinion. Reddit is censored, manipulated, and calculated with special interest in mind. Once it started playing with the big guys in the information world, it was taken over and controlled. Maybe in the early early days it was legit, but not today.
LOL this isn't a college paper.
It's only a temporary ban until they can put together the new security processes. Open the floodgates isn't far off from the policy the EU has implemented, and Obama's program that was bringing them in very-much trivialized the security protocols of the process. I agree overall that the immigration process could be expedited to make it easier for people that want to become citizens that contribute to society. But in this case with the specific countries, we're actively engaged in warfare. It's not anti-immigration it's pro-security.\n\n>A unilateral ban of complete countries will only lead to more radicalization of American citizens\n\nI don't even buy this for a second. If something as small as a temporary ban of threat countries radicalizes you, you were probably teetering on becoming a criminal in the first place. People can't start killing people and then say policies were to blame.\n\n\nAlso, US code Title 12, Chapter 8, Sec. 2 shows that this is something that has always been in place. In fact, Obama enacted it in 2011 with Iraqis with very little media coverage. It's really not as shocking as the media has been portraying it to be, especially when we're actively bombing these countries. The problem is that the media is hyper-covering these stories and blowing them all out of proportion. I'm all for discussing the pros and cons, but very little rational dialogue going on in the social realms overall.
Sweet, I'm bunking in the privileged camp! We can stay up late and tell stories of our privilege.
Everyone attacking the branches of evil, but the Fed is the **ROOT**!
Looks to me like he was actually brushing her hair down after fixing it, but he did keep one eye on the pervy threat and quickly guided her to safety.
That guy has a moth problem at home.
How about just being pro-lumber? Now there's an idea!
It's not racist at all. People in America have been watching too much news media on TV that's telling them that everything is racist racist racist. The news media controls the dialogue in the U.S. and most Americans never learned critical thinking in schools so they all regurgitate it.\n\nThe woman was talking about how she makes that dish in the summer. The host said "Do you make Kool-Aid?" because most people make Kool-aid in the summer, and he was trying to say something to add to her making it in the summer.\n\nThen all the dumb-shit American sheep go on about how it's a stereotype because apparently Kool-aid is off limits in discussion due to people's skin color. Fucking idiots, man.
Honestly, you have to be ignorant as fuck to not see that Rockefeller is a piece of shit elitist.
I never had a flu shot and went 6 years without ever getting the flu. 6 YEARS. Only time I got sick was throwing up from drinking too much :P\n\nThen last year one of my job contracts required I get a flu shot so I reluctantly did. That year I got the flu!\n\nThis year I didn't have to get a flu shot and everyone around me has been getting the flu and I haven't even gotten sick once.\n
Exactly. I love the "dicatator" bullshit Bernie and McCain are trying to spew. No, a dictator sends men with guns after the journalists. Trump is simply exercising his American free speech to call them out on their bullshit.
How do you know this is his plan and that he doesn't actually believe in tariffs? As a libertarian with an Austrian-economics background I really don't want to believe that Trump believes tariffs are actually effective in improving an economy, and I hope you're right that he has a bigger plan in all this.
I don't think buying a coat from Mexico is the issue, more like car repair shops that are going to see steep prices in their car parts which could impact their business. A huge portion of that stuff you see in AutoZone is from Mexico. Might be a good idea to get some parts you might need for your car now.
Remember a "dating website" Todd and Clare tried to do this to Julian Assange?
Wait... they stopped that one they were building around 2013/14 mid-way?
What cypher?  The FBI has broken their code?  Source for this claim?
[Caravan to Midnight](http://www.caravantomidnight.com). 100%. I listen to it every day.\n\nRed Ice Radio is pretty good too. Haven't listened to that one in a while though.
Bill Clinton's wife.
Get off your lazy ass and research it yourself.
Just listen to NPR. Everything is gender, sexuality, and skin color. All of it.\n\nTheir stories are always, *"Today we talk to an impoverished, black, lesbian, Somalian woman down on her luck in every way possible and how white male society is to blame."*
Literally a Nazi helper who admits he has no remorse or regret for taking property from the Jews as they were sent to death camps.\n\nYou can't fucking make this shit up. This fucker needs to be behind bars.
Wish I could say the same where I live. People at work only mentioned the lame ditch-work protests this week.\n\n\nAbsolutely no dialogue about the stuff that matters, but that's how the news media works - they control the dialogue for the useful idiots stupid enough to tune in. The dumbest conversations in the midst of this shadow government exposure. There's tons of other things to focus on: muslim brotherhood running Libya, Yemen/Saudi conflicts, a President completely calling out all the major media groups on their bullshit.. \n\n\n..But no, let's talk about a bunch of losers that didn't go to work this week. That's what's important!\n\n\nSad to say these people aren't ever going to wake up until they first unplug.
Shove them up your ass, Billy.
Todd and Clare, anyone?
Or even Libya - that was her legacy. You want to see another country the media has been ignoring, Libya is being run by the Muslim Brotherhood and they're torturing Libyans. But oh man, that sucks we just lost the feed.
I first heard it on [Red Ice Radio](http://www.rediceradio.net). They redpilled me several years ago on what has been happening in Sweden, and I would have had no idea otherwise. Hearing Trump talk about it recently is so refreshing. Something so dark and horrible that they've been trying to hide is now being brought into the light of truth for all to see. Trump is truly a hero for destroying this corrupt propaganda media, both in the States and overseas.
Under Betsy DeVos' voucher plan, these schools would cease to have any students, and students would flood to the schools that actually want to teach.
[I'll just leave this video here.](https://youtu.be/xlkEraYbUko?t=23s) It's satisfying to watch if you don't like McCain.
People are so damn sensitive to anything that talks about race. I miss the early 2000's when comedians constantly talked about race and it was HILARIOUS!
Holy shit, the best thing about being a kid was that you just had fun and made friends. Race wasn't even something on your mind. Now they want to introduce this topic to KIDS??? WTF is wrong with these people? Talk about going after the weakest - pushing their propaganda on this vulnerable age group. Disgusting!
Just saw [this Soros article](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-21/us-lawmakers-are-probing-soros-involvement-european-politics) posted on ZH...\n\nOne can only hope, but not get one's hopes up too much.
Wow, even going up a ramp at low speeds and mustang drivers can't keep it from spinning out.
Says the fucking moron who fell for phone prankster claiming to be Ukrainian leader and proceeded to talk policy with them. McCain is a senile warmongering psychopath.
It's not fucking racist. She makes that dish in the summer. People drink Kool-aid in the summer.
I think I'm mixed up because they called it Chandler, but showed a sky view of Ocotillo.
Of course they didn't.  They are hoping no one reads it and then they will claim Clinton tried to certify pedophiles later.  
And yet another admin suspended OPs account and removed this thread, so yes doxxing.
Source?  Do you know where you are?  
I have a feeling 2 years for now, these people will still be using what about hillary. 
The evidence is a 4chan post.  The irony here is palpable.
At the very least, 2 men conspired to commit murder.  
Are they going to uncover that the Shriners are associated with children's hospitals next?
What is stopping them now?  Trump has no problem removing people from office who won't do what he wants. 
That is exactly what a CTR shill would say!  Busted!
No.  This is a framed picture hanging in the White House, so it is a picture of a picture.  You are 0-2 on making assumptions.  
I like how they always point to cheese pizza, yet the phrase "cheese pizza" is nowhere to be found in the emails.
Not believing a claim is not claiming the opposite.  If u/artiemes cant back his claim of a pink invisible unicorn it just is not believed.  Not believing him isnt claiming the opposite.  There may acually be a unicorn there, he just has no evidence for it, so it should not be believed until proven.
He basically just told you to think of the children.
It is tradition that presidential appointees submit letters of resignation to new presidents.  Trump accepted them.  The only weird thing is they usually wait for a successor to be named.  This is pretty normal.
>visualize how great the planet will become without satanic pedos running the world\n\nThe republicans?  The speaker of the house they had before Ryan was literally convicted of molesting children, but keep eating that pizza and believe the pedos are gone.\n
This just gets dumber and dumber.  
They are under surveillance?  From whom?  Pizzagators have been clear no one has investigated this. 
Interesting.  I will keep my eyes and ears open.  
Well, I for one am glad we are starting to hold government officials accountable.
The symbols were in the Podesta emails?  I'm  pretty sure [this shit post](http://i.imgur.com/RXZUHDD.png) started it all.  
The worse part of this is it is done even without convictions.  They could just seize your property without even proving you committed a crime.
The Russian ambassador can't just become a private citizen.  He's a government official 24 hrs a day.  
What was the sub?
Texan here.  This is stupid and you should feel bad.
I mean the guy owns a ping pong themed restaurant.  It makes no sense for him to take that picture.  He must really be sacrificing kids with Obama in the basement of the Alamo.
I'm glad after the successful bust of that SLC daycare center, everyone is still concentrating on taking down the nefarious public businesses.
The levees were built and maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers which is part of the federal government.  Not sure how you can blame the city.
So he's basically an r/conspiracy user.
They are talking about heated pools not jacuzzis.
Why are they waiting?  Who is holding them back?  Trump has demonstrated he will remove people from office if they don't do what he wants.
There was a post here yesteday about how after Pizzagate was closed, alot of people came from thedonald.
I noticed the pizza is pepperoni and not cheese.  Does that mean they are wanting midget porn?
I googled it.  Couldn't find any.  
I understand why you don't like to delete number 1 meme posts, but it encourages people to try and do a mods are asleep post to get a meme posted and not deleted.  
How is this being decoded?  Are they going to follow a made up decoding from 4chan like they did last time?
Can someone link the Podesta email that says "cheese pizza"?  I searched and nothing comes up.  
Explain how the 20yr US Senator is going after his buddies?   Pizzagate is dumb and this is even dumber.
It is no dumber than this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5lpmco/pzzgat3_who_is_matt_duss_lets_get_digging/\n\n\nThe top investigators at Voat are taking that serious, yet this is making it look bad?  It is the exact same type of post.
Does this really matter?  She lost.  It is amazing how so many posts here are about the loser and not much is being posted about the guy who actually will be in power.
None.  The republicans will impeach him and install Pence and they will laugh all the way to the bank.
Source?
Underground tunnel also known as the White House.  This was at the White House Christmas party, but if you need it to fit your tunnel narrative, knock yourself out. 
Here is why I doubt:  \n\nThere is a claim of a code.  A post on 4chan madlibbed the code and everyone took it for the gospel.  No real proof of anything other than people saying I don't understand, so it must be pedophilia.  Comet Ping Pong somehow got thrown into this as the owner is mentioned a a guest chef for a fundraiser and CPP is also used as a location for a fundraiser.  I don't find the campaign manager of the democratic presidential candidate discussing fundraisers code for pedophilia.  "Cheese pizza" is the only code people claim is for pedophiles, but shockingly the phrase "cheese pizza" in never mentioned in the thousands of emails.  Alefantis emails about making a pizza.  He owns a pizza restaurant, but talk of making pizzas is supposed to be used as code for sex with children.  The whole premise that Pizzagate is built on is faulty.
But how is any of this related to Podesta.  CPP and the owner are only mentioned in the wikileaks emails in talks about fundraisers.  It shouldnt be shocking that the campaign manager of a major canidate is promoting fund raisers.  
I thought JTRIG was the govt shill program.  They have a new boss now.
He's such an outsider he named the head of he Republican Party as his chief of staff.  He's such an outsider he's named lifelong politicians and people who paid for Hillary speechs at Goldman Sachs to his cabinet.  What do you keep lying to yourself?  There was no revolution, it is just more of the same.
Sending coded emails isnt illegal.  If your evidence that the code is about illegal activity, then please present it.  Where did you obtain this cypher?  You cant figure it out and wild speculation are not reasons a police investigation should be started.
That is exactly what a robot lizard would say.
Considering to be eligibile for the scholarship one must have applied, approved or be eligible for DACA or TPS, I'm guessing no they aren't violating RICO statutes.
I find it amazing how r/conspiracy trusts the government now.  The old standard posts are shouted down now.  \n\n\nIs Trump a secret Russian agent?  How dare you suggest that!\n\n\nCould Trump create a false flag to push his agenda?  That is crazy talk!\n\n\nWhy are so many Goldman Sachs employees being appointed to cabinet positions?  You need knowledgeable people, stupid! \n\n\nIf you try and push legitimate conspiracies about Our Dear Leader, you are accused of being a shill or turning this place into r/politics.   \n\n\n

Are you claiming that the FBI recognizes pasta, walnut sauce, etc as child porn codes or just cheese pizza?
Sounds like you might own a pizza parlor
I guess my issue is the emails never say the phrase "cheese pizza" and there are no symbols in the emails.
Are you claiming that is CPP?  That guy is in SF.
I enjoyed Rule by Secrecy.  I found it fascinating.
Being vague is what they do.  First they go on and on about Podesta and their evidence is a  "pedo code" which was just a shit post from 4chan.  They move onto Comet Ping Pong and its owner which was mentioned as a fundraiser in the emails.  Must be where the molesting is happening because the chairman for the democratic presidential candidate emailing about a fundraiser must be pedo speak and not him literally doing his job.\n\nFor CPP, you will get talk of instagram, basements, and satanism.  You ask for evidence and they move the goalposts to some vague international pedophile ring which happens to entail any arrest and news article of any pedophile ring.  \n\nYou will ask," what does some pedo ring in Norway have to do with Podesta or CPP?"  They will give some vague answer about global pedos and they are getting closer, but they aren't.  They have no evidence so they desperately search for any evidence of pedophilia and they shoehorn pizzagate in.
The title of the thread is If Sessions is confirmed...  My question is why are they waiting on Sessions?  There is nothing stopping them.  They could have made arrests since the inauguration.  
That was what people said about Obama's birth certificate.  I'm glad that isn't mentioned anymore now that he released it.
I remember when the FBI raided that day care center thanks to the crack investigating here.  Weren't we all awarded a medal for that?
Walnut Sauce?  Going to need a source that isn't a 4chan post.
No.  OP clearly says this is apparently an elaborately decorated tunnel that Obama likes to play "ping pong" with little kids in while a bunch of people eat finger foods.
I never said he did anything unlawful.  He did removed the acting attorney general for not enforcing the immigration ban.  So I don't understand why they need to wait on Sessions.  What is holding them back?
Considering this whole conspiracy doesn't have evidence, it shouldnt be shocking they believe this without evidence.
This is when you decide to use Occam's  razor?  
Right.  The issue is only one person on the phone was a diplomat,  the other was a private citizen acting like one

It's not even flimsy.  One username was linked to being a customer to CPP, a public restaurant, so this somehow implicates CPP.  If the guy buys car parts, he just implicated Autozone as a child sex dungeon too.
The code words are literally fan fiction made up by a post on 4chan.
I'm pretty sure my facebook likes have stopped domestic abuse and Kony.
These are symbols.  You said the emails have codes that needs to be investigated.  Are these symbols in the emails?
The worst part was it just kinda ended.  There was no big comeuppance for the NWO.  It was hugely disappointing.
Even if he did, they wouldn't be happy about it.  Alefantis did an interview to answer their stupid questions and it wasn't enough.  It won't ever be enough.
He's only in personal debt to Wall Street for $1.85 bn.  I'm sure that has no influence on him though.
Nice doxxing of a random guys facebook.  I'm so surprised the admins banned r/pizzagate.
I'm genuinely curious as to darling being an illuminati word.   What is the significance of it?
This sub is full of little boys or does pizza mean little girls, or is it child porn?   I can't keep track of the convuloted code that y'all mad libbed into existence.
I know what you mean.  My point is he won't be transparent in his old business dealings.  What makes you think he is going to be transparent in his new business of running the country.
Of course they say it didn't happen.  Orlando, Sandy Hook, the Boston bombing, etc... never happened here.  All these horrible things are faked by the govt for reasons.  This place lives in a fantasy land where horrible events never happen.
You've been shitposting there for months while they have been banning people left and right.  Did you care then?  Nope.\n\nNow your banned and you want to whine about it.  That is fucking hilarious.  No one cares.
I like how this sub can become r/srs when it wants to.  Yes, murder can be funny.
I'm a bit disappointing that no one has commented to this.  It enjoyed reading it.  As someone who works in the industry, I think something you may see is a war to disrupt supply.  As much as Exxon has lost due to sanctions, it is a drop in a 55 gallon drum to what they have lost to the low price of oil.\n\nA lot of people said the Iraq war was about stealing the Iraqi oil.  It was about disrupting the supply.  Supply is disrupted and there is an increase in the demand.  The ramifications last for years.  
Don't worry.  They are already moving the goalposts and saying it is this vague global conspiracy where the point at every pedophile case and say, "see, pizzagate!" 
His point was they could just block the car from going anywhere, then just wait until he had to get out due to hunger, thirst, shitty pants...   
Its not even that.  They are trying to make Jesus come back, so they need Israel to remain whole.
Complete transparency and Trump?  He wont even give an illusion of transparency by releasing his tax records.  His govt is going to do the opposite of that.
Holding fundraisers is now suspicious activity? 
These are the same group of people who started this whole thing based code words from a 4chan post.
Civil forfeiture.
Please tell me you forgot the /s.
The FBI catalogued walnut sauce, hot dog, pizza, and all the other code words in 2007?  Give me the source for that.  
Right, but why can't the attorney general now do this?
The funny thing is I can't think of a time I've ever heard darling used in real life.
I'm curious how the Stratfor Austin office relates to Podesta and Pizzagate.
Bad at what?  Am I supposed to be in this for the karma?
I remember when r/conspiracy's crack investigative team busted that daycare center.  The arrests were all over the news.  Everyone here got medals.  Oh thats right, y'all just harassed a daycare center because things seemd "creepy".
You called him a sellout and now you are shocked you were banned?  
Hilarious.  A search warrant should be issued because of unproven threats?
Democrats are the patron saints of unintended consequences.
Because I do dumb shit. Clearly.
It's called fucking weather.
Nope. You might want to move along.
The real anarchists are all of the DHS employees who are completely fucking ignoring her stupid ruling.
You are a liar.
We used to do great things. We used to not be scared all the time.
I wouldn't have sold that asshole a gun, either. \n\nAct stupid? Hit the bricks, asshole.
He and Taran Butler are BFF. Taran Butler can shoot. As good as anybody on the planet. His only competition are named Daniel Horner and Jerry Miculek.\n\nTaran Butler taught Keanu Reeves to shoot. And Keanu can shoot. For real. Keanu is world class. Easily pro level. \nEdit: I'm going to go ahead and stand behind this statement. A lot of people replied to me, and trashed Taran Butler. He beat me and everybody else like a drum for a number of years, and I'm not able to get on the Taran bashing train. I was there, and watched him beat Jerry and Daniel. I also watched them both beat him in turn. Those other names y'all threw at me might win occasionally, but they don't have the consistency Butler, Horner, and Miculek have had. A USPSA shooter having a good day isn't the same as one of the big three doing it year after year. That's not taking anything away from those guys, it's just the way it is. And Reeves can fully run at a pro level. Why? He can afford to train up on the pistol. That's what it's about. He has enough money to burn $400 worth of pistol ammo every Saturday.
I didn't reply very well last time, and I should have. \n\nI'm not a scientist, but I paid very careful attention in every class through high school, and through college when scientists were talking. So I apply the scientific method, and more importantly, Critical Thinking 101.\n\nThat fucking class. I went into it a newborn babe, thinking I knew everything. I didn't know shit. But I came out the other side bruised, and beaten, and fucking scarred. The interim professor that taught my class was some kind of AI ruled male model fucking German machine. The most pitiless, horrible, logical goddamn devoid of human behavior thing I have ever encountered. \n\nI still hate that motherfucker. But, thanks to him, I can't fall for a fallacious argument. Even if I wanted to. I just don't have the tools to. That sonofabitch. Say goodbye to B movies.
He's sitting there hoping that this means he doesn't have to be married to her anymore.
It's odd that so many people who have never had a job in their lives are wearing Carhartt coats.
Well. It is an electric lamp.
Very, very nice. \n\nWhat is the thickness of the stainless you used? I like the hell out of that knife.
Yes. They do. The first problem is, they aren't designed, in any way, for military service.
Well, you just summed up the whole liberal mental illness.
In another month, she will have jaws like a pit bull.\n\nShe'll jump up, grab a tree branch in her teeth, and hang there, peacefully taking a nap.
Hooray. I'm ready to get all of the uninsured motorists off the streets in Austin. 
Yes. I'm not sure how to state it more plainly.\n\nThis is the United States of America. If you can't be bothered to just fucking show up and collect your free ID, so you can exercise the franchise, then no, hell no, why should you be allowed a say in who runs things around here?\n\n
Communists don't dance.
Eagle Peak in Austin. Fuck that place. Fuck it right in the mouth.
Fab 42, and the Fabrication Support Building are already built. \n\nIt's been sitting there, waiting for tools. \n\nThere won't be 10,000 jobs. That's just a goddamn lie. At peak, during construction, there were around 5,600 people there, on site everyday, building it.\n\nThere will be some jobs created, if you take into account the army of parasites that feed off of all of the workers, like the safety trainers, and the drug testers, and the "safety professionals", and the security guards manning the fences around the site, and all of the cops locking everybody up as fast as they can.\n\nThat is the most awful fucking place for a construction worker in the developed world.\n\nIt's like Dante and Salvador Dali got all fucked up on acid and ether, and designed a special Hell for construction workers.\n\nFuck, fuck, fuck that place.
You don't need to ever worry about the type of ammo you use in an AR, if it is assembled correctly. EXCEPT for handloads.\n\nA properly assembled AR, even a dirty one, will function any factory ammunition you feed it, without fail. That is the immutable truth.\n\nAll arguments to the contrary will be made by people with junk rifles.
By "someone", you must be referring to men.
I don't want any cabal in power to deny anyone the ability to exercise their right to vote. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty militantly opposed to just about every bullshit stunt our governments try to pull every goddamn legislative cycle. \n\nBut I will say, with absolute conviction, that there are only two reasons you can't vote in Texas:\n\n1: You are not an eligible voter.\n\n2: You are too goddamn dumb to be allowed to vote.\n\nIt is not a high bar. Most retarded people I know can, and do, pull it off successfully, every cycle.\n\nJust saying.
That's a fucked up Remington painting.\n\nNow I have to have a 4' x 8' framed print. Goddamnit.
Only if you want to do any fucking thing you can think of.\n\nYou don't need an ID to breathe, you just need one to do any other thing imaginable. \n\nHurr duurr, I got no ID, muh rites, I gots to votes! It's a fucking straw man argument. They've been packing the vote boxes in the valley since the teens, as in the nineteen teens, and we are destroying that tradition with these discriminatory laws. Hurr, duurrrrr!
India does.\n\nIndia.\n\nThey don't have toilets.
Just the mental illness one.
And people with your opinion deserve to be punched in the face. See how causality works?
Glock.Glock.Glock.\nGlock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.Glock.
Well, there's another problem right there.
LOL.
Well, it was a good try. Thanks for playing.
Have Benadryl topical antihistamine on hand. Apply to bite as soon as it happens. There will be two tiny holes, and immediate redness.\n\nIt's like magic. We have four bottles. One in each car, one in the kitchen junk drawer, and one in the master bath.\n\nWhen I was about ten, I got bit on the calf, and my mom had to cut my pants off of my leg with scissors due to the swelling. She sprayed Benadryl antihistamine all over it, and the swelling went away over night. Tiny, tiny necrosis. Like a scab. I've done it twice more, when I know I got bit. Like magic.\nI'm not anybody, but my understanding is that histamines are long chain proteins. An antihistamine breaks the protein chain, and it can't digest your tissue after it's broken. I don't really need or want a broader understanding of that, because I think it works based on empirical evidence.
Epic exit. LOL.
Elite Guns on Parmer has a great, I mean great selection. And they are super cool.
Who pays for that?
There are two at my Cabelas, at $700.\n\nI'm thinking about buying one, because my crystal ball is telling me about the lifting of some import restrictions.\n\nIf it's broken, it can be fixed. The parts are sound, even if drunken monkeys assembled it. Just my two cents.
I've got a Draco with a pistol brace, and magpul furniture with a rail on the gas tube, and a red dot. I also put a Tapco brake on it. It shoots 5" groups at 100 yards, and runs like a machine gun. It's now my truck gun. It's freaking awesome.
I think 13. I can't get to the mags at the moment, or the pistol. They are supposedly rare in .357.\nI found it in a pawn shop in a tiny town.
Intel in Chandler is the most awful fucking place on the planet to be a welder. Fucking goddamn awful.
My theory is toxoplasma gondii. \n\nThere were not this many mentally ill people when I was young.\n\nI pay attention, and always have.\n\nI blame toxoplasma gondii, and cat memes. There. I said it.
The only thing that article got right was the fact that America hates California.
I'd just invite them to stand next to me when I fire my .223 rifle with a Rolling Thunder compensator on it.\n\nEven in .223, it's just offensive, even if you are wearing ear pro. Actually, it isn't offensive: it's infuriating.
"My first goal, each and every night, is to go home to my family."\n\nEven if it means I have to kill all of you people.\n\n\nWell, how bout you turn your shit in, and we'll pay somebody else $123,000 a year to act like a fucking peace officer. Evidently, you're too fucking fragile for this kind of work, so maybe you should go back to junior college, and get into sales or something. 
He does compete.
You goddamn sure can shoot somebody with a deadly weapon, menacing you. Sorry, but I have to disagree with you real strong on that point.\n\nBefore you even get going, here's why: if I punch you in the face, particularly sucker-punch you, with brass knuckles, I will probably kill you. Period, end. \n\nIf you don't die, you will, with 100% certainty, be permanently disfigured, and probably lose an eye, and/or most of your teeth. Your jaws, and orbital sockets, or skull, will be fractured.\n\nIf I get a good right hook in, without brass knuckles, 75% of the population will also suffer similar injuries, although without lacerations, and a lot of the trauma created by the brass knuckles.\n\nWhen a physically hard grown man punches a person in the face, especially if that person isn't a physical match, that man does so with the expectation of causing grave bodily harm. Real life isn't like a video game. If you get punched in the face for real, to the hospital you will go.\n\nThat is a very real, and grown-up fact.
Like urban legends where they shoot women in the face, and machine gun children to death?
LOL
There isn't one goddamn thing that anyone can say that makes the Glock 17 and 19 not exist. \n\nThey exist.
Must be a shortage of gasoline and matches around that town.
And Seekins doesn't hire executive level employees that have shot women holding babies in the face. At least, I'm not aware of a Seekins executive that has shot an unarmed woman, who was holding a baby in her arms, through the window in a door, with a .308 rifle.\n\nSo, there's that.
I really hope that works out for you. It sounds exhausting. \n\nYou poor thing.
Toxoplasma Gondii.\n\nMark my words. I'm always right.
It's been happening for a hundred goddamn years in Texas, and longer. \n\nAnd this isn't Wikipedia. Do your own goddamn research.
I reported this activity to the FBI at tips.fbi.gov.\n\nIt would be great if everyone else did, too.
If you are a child born on a foreign military base, or a foreign diplomatic territory you are just as much an American citizen as any other American. It isn't a grey area. Your parents are just in service, and you got born overseas.
We are living in great times.
The only thing interesting that happened in Abilene.
Pull the barrel, have a gunsmith install it, clock it correctly, and throw away every metal mag you see.\n\nClean it. It looks like a Bridgeport shit in the action. The gas block isn't installed correctly. The gas port in the barrel is probably the wrong size.\n\nIf the barrel doesn't clock right, send it back.
Aaannndd...this is how the sub gets banned. Dammit.
No.
Toxoplasma gondii. That's all I can come up with.
Congrats on your barrel and bolt carrier group.
This. I can shoot, and I have four of the best four barrels on the planet. If I put three shots inside an inch with factory ammo, out of any of the four, I nod my head, stick out my bottom lip, and quietly say "that'll do pig. That'll do"\n\nSimple trigger variation or too much caffeine can rule the day.\n\nSub MOA. Sub circle jerk is more like it.
Just a thought, but if you can't manage your budget any better than providing literal cattle trucks to move your primary resource, maybe you shouldn't be in charge of the budget.\n\nJust as a civilian, that is used to not having a budget.
The reason it isn't working is that we have voter ID laws. It's called causality.
I fucken told you guys.
Do your own goddamn research.\n\nIf you don't have the motivation or can't be bothered to get an ID like everyone else, why should you get a say in how things are run around here. \n\nYour feigned concern for morons is completely fucking wasted on me, and every other contributing member of society. You can save that shit for Twitter.
It's a mental illness. Four hundred monkeys banging out nonsense on a typewriter will never change actual facts.\nIt's why Johns Hopkins decided that mutilating mentally ill people didn't align with their mandate as care providers. To put it in laymen's terms, surgically removing a man's penis doesn't make them a woman, or treat their profound mental illness.\n\nIt's pandering to the pathology of a mentally ill person, and perversely mutilating them to feed into that pathology. \nThe end result is, you get to feel all righteous because you have assented to a sick person mutilating their body, so you can assuage your own pathology. Which is just a result of toxoplasma gondii, in my opinion, infecting your diseased brain.\nI can think of no other affliction that makes people who can read, write, and otherwise portray a simulation of a human, behave in a way that is in direct contravention to their own self interest, and direct, inarguable, empirical observation.\n\nWhen the grown ups talk about the mental health crisis in this country, they aren't talking about the less-than-one-percentage-point portion of the population so sadly afflicted with gender dysphoria.\n\nThey are obliquely referring to you. You, in the early stages of whatever pathology you are currently incubating. You crazy people that don't know anything, and can't be healed. \nThere's just a broken class in this country, sadly. People that traded the tools of reason, the gifts given to them by their creator, for conformity to the lowest common denominator of an afflicted underclass. \nPeople like you will agree to any ridiculous thing to avoid ostracism from the class of the barely-cans. You know, the people who can barely do anything. They can't produce anything anyone can hold in their hand, or anything a person can drive or walk past and look at, or anything that actually benefits their community, past a gawky mural, or an art installation, or any other physical manifestation of money spent that could have been used to actually benefit people that are hurting with actual physical, manifest needs.\nThe barely-cans are the people that applaud Starbucks hiring ten thousand refugees, while a million damaged US vets can't afford a seven dollar cup of their burnt-ass, awful coffee.\nThe barely-cans are the cuckolds that demand we let in, unfettered, any, any person that demands, with no right to it, entry into our country, and the ability to disappear into the population, and the freedom to do anything they want. \n\nBarely-cans think that we owe people who allowed their own countries to collapse, and then abandoned them, to come here and repeat that same stupid exercise in the country that five generations of my family died building and fighting for in wars.\n\nBarely-cans think a lot. They think all the time. Then, they all agree. And because their group-think is already based on the adolescent mental illness it is founded on, the outcome is always devoid of any reckoning of cause and effect. \n\nBarely-cans are the patron saints of unintended consequences. Couple no idea of how the world works, with an absolutely obtuse view of human nature, then marry it to an adolescent, if not pre-pubescent disregard of three thousand years of recorded history, and then mix it in a repulsive inability to apply one goddamn brain cell towards critical thinking, and..we have you. \n\nWhat. Is. Wrong. With. This. World.\n\nA good-for-nothing generation. Not good for one goddamn thing. You'll give your jobs away, if the grown ups let you. Not just your STEM jobs. You'll give away your Starbucks job, too. Some semblance of self interest, some forward thinking, thinking about the birthright of your children, would lend you a single shred of credibility.\n\nUnfortunately, people like you have none. It's disturbing. What do you think your role is in a post-American world? I've got news for you, cuck. You are a slave. \n\nI don't mean a wage slave, which you are now. I mean an actual slave. \n\nThose things you do to assuage your guilt, and fit into the herd of the rest of the sheep, don't buy you anything. The creatures you invite into your home hold not one shred of gratitude in their hearts for you or your bloodline. They hate you, and they have since the fourteenth century. Ten million men bled to death with dirt in their mouths to protect you from the rapist that you welcome onto your land. You are a willing cuckold, an embarrassment to your country, your people, and your family. \nYou haven't gained any nobility, or the moral high ground. You are just misguided, and adolescent.
This. Skip .22s go straight to 9mm.
Prices went up sharply in the last three months, then. Oof.
Literally, you can fall down, and someone will physically carry you to a chair and bestow one upon you. \n\nAt the DPS HQ in Austin, the most jaded, evil, inefficient, horrible civil servants ever imagined, dreamed up by a feverish Salavador Dali, will perform CPR, and hook an AED up to your corpse to force an ID on you if it for muh votes. \n\nIf you are a contractor trying to renew your CDL, you'll sit there, ignored, for four fucking hours.

Nope.

Yes I did. It's a nice pistol, but I don't know why you'd walk past four better ones to pick it up.\nI want a 226, and I will shoot the shit out of it when I find one.\n\nBut I wouldn't take it to a fight if I had a choice. Does that make sense?
Easy there, fascists. That's how you get all busted up. \n\nThat pit bull mouth of yours is writing checks your poodle asses can't cash.
Hide and watch. We'll see about the Commander in Chief paying $580 million dollars over the lifespan for an inferior pistol.\n\nWatch him buy Glocks for everyone.
That is a possibility. More likely, I root around in junk cars, and old buildings, and build shit. Spiders get into stuff, and I dislodge them. \nAll of a sudden, my thumb hurts like a motherfucker!\n\nTwo tiny holes on the knuckle. Fuck. Bit. Benadryl. Solved.
I don't give a two penny fuck what you think about anything. I'll say whatever I want about whatever I want. You don't get to constrain that, no matter the imaginary moral high horse you think you can get up on. That's the first amendment, and my right to free speech. Concentrate on that, cause god knows you don't understand the other twenty six enumerated rights.
My wife is a housewife. My inlaws are retired. My daughter is a full time student, and my brother in law is unemployed. \n\nAll of them have state IDs, and all of them voted.\nI have no idea what you are saying, as usual.
I carry an M&P Compact in 357 SIG. It's like having a semiautomatic .44 derringer. I love it. The bullets shoot through everything. It rings steel like you hit it with a 24 oz framing hammer as hard as you can swing it.\nFireball, loud AF.
I wouldn't carry a Sig to a fucking dog fight. \n\nYes, they are nice. I fully want a 9mm 226. I will own one, soon. \n\nBut give Sigs to soldiers? No. That's as wrong as two boys fucking. \n\nGrown ups should have provided Glock goodness to our soldiers long ago. Gaston just wouldn't come off with those patent rights would he?\n\nIt's a brave new world. Our war fighters need Glock goodness. And an enhanced 1911, or better yet 2011, option when they graduate to it..\n\nAs a matter of fact, just let me pick their handguns. 
LOL.
If you spit on someone, you should fully and completely expect to be punched in the face.\n\n
Turns out, their CIC might get to have a say in the proceedings.
I didn't struggle with grades in his stupid class, I just wanted to argue and fight when it was over. He told me I was "motivated". Asshole.
Grimace. 
I can't wait until the time that mental health screening and drug tests are required for public officials.\n\nYou know, so maybe publicly paid salaries are allocated for people that aren't fucking lunatics.
Oh, blow it out your ass Mr. shithouse lawyer. Go argue with some neckbeards you boring cunt.
"The point of the ID laws isn't to stop everyone, just to put in place a significant enough deterrent to stop some people."\n\nExactly. The "some people" you refer to are people who are not eligible to vote. They don't get to vote, because they aren't allowed to vote. Not everybody gets to vote. Only eligible people get to vote. The right to vote is not a universal right. They can go vote in their country. Or, they shouldn't have committed a felony, and forfeited their right to vote. \n\nIt is that simple.
You just wrote two tear-jerking paragraphs about an anecdote that a reporter from New Jersey made up and spoon fed to you.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, voter ID laws keep the DNC from committing massive election fraud in the corrupt counties in South Texas, and that is the story of that. \n\nNo Huffington Post bullshit your wife's boyfriend told you about will change that one, immutable, crystalline fact.\n\nHooray for voter ID laws.
LOL.\n\nFUND YOUR OWN CRUSADE.
They won't be coming to Texas. You can bet on that.
I'll bet this holds up to scrutiny. I give him three months.
If he moved to Texas, I'd vote for him. And volunteer in his first campaign.
The shitty trigger cancels out the barrel. Use of a bull pup is the direct result of a flawed military doctrine\n\nSorry, that's just the case.
You need bureaucracy to enact programs. It's just the necessary evil. Sometimes its horribly inefficient. Then the people get mad,  change power.\n\nMinimum government is literally a hunter gatherer society. \n\nWe want roads,  we pay for a lot of overhead before we pay the guy paving. That's government\n
I thought Putin told you guys to calm it down
Why are there no charges? 
Or political figure
Well use it to come up with a better insult kiddo. You still live with your rents? 
Honestly if the rules are enforced,  the extra overhead just means smaller farms are bought out by bigger farms who can afford it. There's only so much technology that can replace manual labor. If we can only hire legals,  we'll need to raise wages our subsidize farmers. It's that simple.\n\nIn one scenario,  the illegal immigrants eat the cost. In the other we do.
Seriously. 
Nowhere is better than backwards
Wow something is going down
Not if your elected apparently
Any one. You guys hate text so much. 4chan
I work at a steel mill. This is not how we talk to people.
Faaaag
Seriously?  Workers fired for not showing up for work? \n\nBusiness owners and co-workers shouldn't suffer for your political beliefs. You're responsible for showing up for work. If you're scheduled on Christmas you don't get to call in because of your religious beliefs. This should be no different
Press is important. Wouldn't a great leader bring them to his side? 
Line jumping

I wouldn't trust trump with my child let alone national security
I'd just be happy my kids not retarded honestly. 
Yes

So you're not an American person? 
I respect anyone who is beholden to their beliefs and not their party.
Yup

Hahaha nah, although we've had a couple transsexuals.
Send us your reasonably bundled masses. Vancouver and Ottawa are perfect for Google
Sjws and trumpsters should just kiss already
No they hired him from that email
Nuke Canada
Tbf both sides are guilty
Oh like what Comey did? 
God I hate Trump almost as much as sjws
Yeah even if you hired young kids,  they're available what?  2 months a year? 
Hard man to replace.\n\nThe only celebrity death that ever got to me
You're not American if you don't hate Muslims and love Christians. I wish people would just give Trump a chance to racially cleanse America,  gawd.
#healerlivesmatter
Internet trolls have been legitimized now mmmk, a bit of respect
The message may have merit but the messenger is fucking nuts.\n\nI like the press. A good leader would bring them to his side,  not attempt to discredit them. Maybe if he didn't act like a little bitch we could have a serious conversation about immigration.
Community college nets you 100k for a trade but it's below too many people.\n\nSource: am tradesmen

Good. Can the Kardashians say something like that so we don't have to see them? 
Gawd dude get a new job if you're so fucking lonely. 🚫 🚀 🔬
1000 people... That's their job. Posting how many posts per hour... Kinda nuts really
No? 
I think most people think it's ridiculous
He's the fucking moron son of a rich guy.
No No tear each other apart it's part of our plan
Shh... She needs *something* to act superior to everyone else
I wasn't talking to you
Nah kids are learning they're welcome in trumpsters troll army, and even a ten year old knows how ridiculous sjws are.\n\nThe new ghostbusters sucked, trumps a fascist,  trannys can pee where they want,  and I don't think there's anything wrong with leaving a dog outside all day. We need a revolution for the moderates.
Omg 😲 that's hell
I'm the happiest I've ever been at thirty with a wife and family. Why does everyone put the pressure on themselves to do something extraordinary? 
As someone in a farming community,  you simply can't find the bodies. No one wants to drive an hour for minimum wage and most don't have the means to. So we have unemployed people,  mostly centered in urban areas. Are they going to have programs to bus them out? Because most don't own cars. Or do I have to pay $18+ to get good workers? \n\nThe way I see it,  we're either subsidized, prices rocket,  or illegal immigrants take the brunt of the risk by working here. Personally I prefer the last option because I'm selfish.
Shouldn't have been. Great athlete,  US citizen. Should be able to protest. Good on him.
He sounds like baby legs from Rick and Morty
Like recycling. You don't need to recycle, it makes an insignificant dent in the landfill. But the idea is to stress the importance of individual participation,  so that group participation rates go up. But if someone throws a can across the landfill wall, it's not going to ruin all recycling efforts.\n\nSo no, you're not important, but it's important that you think you are.
This is trumps America. Trolls have rights and need to be listened to
Fecal down economics
Awesome. People complaining is well within their rights
Yes youre one of them apparently
Or Clinton was awful
He's supposed to be better
Dafuq? 
Russia's up
I mean if you consider opposing view points manipulation, I dunno what to say
Exactly.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure it's not hitting the hard drive. 
Where I'm from,  rural country,  you just can't find the people. The density isn't there. Nobody wants to dive an hour to earn minimum wage. Most people can't afford a car in minimum wage.\n\nSo what,  we raise wages even more to attract more people?  Get together transportation infrastructure for farming communities?\n\nThis isn't free, and the cost is assumed by the consumer and taxpayer,  not by the illegal Mexican.
Great way to protest regardless
Go to a different site then, fuck.
Shut down by antiquated thinking. \n\nIf your party is going to push a socially awkward,  secret riddled grandmother, understand that the political engagement might not be there. The newer generation wouldn't think twice about a women being in power. It's the liberals of old that think it adds to the qualifications. Me, never crossed my mind,  which should be the end goal of feminism anyways. Just seen a secretive,  albeit professional politician.
I tried it because of my family history with Alzheimer's and wanted to see if it helped my fleeting memory as I age.

shh... the best selling beer in America is pure swill compared to my triple filtered chestnut roasted indian pale malt from 3 flannel jacket brewers in portland.
I think it was a dig against our president. \n\nHint: If you find yourself supporting any candidate you're doing the whole critical thinking thing wrong
Idiots. Everyone in Washington. Trump was just an idiot outside as well.
Seriously right
Looks like you need a better education system.
I could. I could also entertain the idea that the corruption that exists now benefits the corporations that fund campaigns. Money wasted on nothing tangible. That's the nature of bureaucracy. \n\nThere's a lot of waste in Canadian healthcare,  but I am glad to have it. 
Nah I think the ten percent of supporters really love what he's doing no matter what. And the left ten percent will hate him no matter what. It's the other eighty percent are mixed,  but a large many of the more moderate voters are thinking "wtf have I done? "\n\nBut myself I underestimated the power of populism,  thinking other levels of government would act as a control.\n\nHonestly,  I regret there wasn't an N/A option. 
I mean, let's be real. Most supporters aren't the yahoos on td. Theyre just regular people like me and you. If there was a question like "do you believe the bowling green massacre was due to the trumps ego?" Lots of people who voted Clinton would answer yes as well. \n\nWe're not necessarily dumb,  just all either ignorant or biased as fuck. But we know we hate group a,  so sure it's their fault.
Americans are really fucking dumb. \n\nIn grade school we had a handicap guy run against the valedictorian,  and the handicap guy won,  just for a laugh really. Can't really do much anyways.\n\nSame idea,  just with world reaching implications instead of cafeteria reaching.
What
I think all the reasonable supporters left with good reason, so you're seeing the die hards. Not much fun arguing with the rights equivalent of an sjw
Sometimes you don't want a craft beer. Sometimes you want alcoholic tap water
I don't get it
It's the kinda sappy uplifting shit that appeals to Oprah moms. It really wasn't a big deal. Like any corporations doing charity. You know the shareholders don't give a shit,  but it's just some faux bullshit to sell burgers to Oprah moms.\n\nI mean at best it's cringe worthy but not inappropriate.
It's barely illegal in Canada,  so why do u want taxed,  sub par,  government regulated weed,  and cops with the marijuana equivalent of a breathalyzer in every car.
What a drama queen
No,  you freaking sjws.\n\nHoly shit... it's like both sides are dismissive and combative....
Seriously. The left shut down the right like the right shut down the left.\n\nI hate Trump but it's not because I think his border control policies are stupid. It's a conversation being shut down by the left because "racism."\n \nThe hill Hill died on was one of faux moral superiority. People want to hear about jobs coming back plain and simple. They don't give a crap about breaking the glass ceiling for a rich white dynasty.
Haha,  I call people cunts. But I find it vulgar and rude to do it in front of my child...\n\nIt's almost like similar behaviour in different situations can result in different outcomes.

Running in the middle of the road is a type of exercise too,  but no-one is advocating that that particular exercise is the best way to keep healthy.
The anti theft cable for table legs is pretty funny given most tables can just be lifted up. I was hoping for an alarm to go off if it gets over 25 yards from you with ur phone.
I think the mom could have staged the break in to get the cops to look into the case again. I think that happens sometimes with phone calls and sightings from parents who will do anything to keep people looking. I know I would.

And Argentina was getting Israeli help, the PM at the time was Menachen Begin and he hated the British since the Mandate of Palestine where he carried out terrorist attacks against U.K. troops and diplomats.

Yeah, Madoff only got caught because he stealed from rich jews, the biggest crime in the US.
Pretty much this.
Is Erdogan still trying to remove Assad? The Syrian War only empowered the Kurdish separatists who are also supported by US and Israel.
Yeah, he is good.
Full Throttle and Time Commando were the first PC games I played back in the early 90s.

I love Keijo!!!!
WaPo is a CIA rag, nothing new about it.
Watergate was coup d'etat made by the "chosen".
If WWIII happens is gonna be nuclear and all the nuke targets are going to be Northern Hemisphere cities and installations (North America, Europe, Russia, India, Middle-East, China, the two Koreas and Japan).\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere is Nuke free and doesn't play any major role in Global disputes, New Zealand is the ideal place to survive WWIII.

 More like the Zion elite.
It was named All Blacks Sevens.
Obama is CIA.
Where is the Whale Whisperer? Such a beautiful movie.
Nixon also didn't trust the CIA.
More like kikestocracy.
WaPo is a CIA rag and PropOrNot is another Neocon think tank.
How does a guy like this get to be an elector in the first place?
Obviously is Rotshchildstan.
and who controls the US media conglomerates?
...on a pig (Hillary).
The Zionist elite that controls the "West" is fully supporting the Sunni "rebels" because they're the lesser threat to Israel.

LBJ and Mossad did it.
Please God no!
>Just like with Iran/Contra\n\nThe funny thing is that Iran-Contra was largely a Jewish Neocon affair with crucial Israeli involvement, the debacle made Reagan toss the Neocons aside temporary from the GOP. They ended supporting Bill Clinton and got jobs in his administration and hoped to repeat this with Hilary.

I think Icke has been right about a lot things recently, the "reptilian" stuff is code word for chosenites.
Flynn is one of the good guys, the real foreign lobby controlling Washington is the jewish-israeli one.

I bet 95% of plastics could be replaced with metals, pulp derivatives, leathers, graphites, etc. Plastic is just cheap and easy to work with.
Canadian tire, of course!
Technically the constitution doesn't want the government to interfere and implement the programs. So it shouldn't be a government issue, deal with it within your unions. Silly millenial feels entitled to second wage for single income earning family, deflecting the issue on the 1% because 99% of the 99% will see this as an easy outlet for their frustrations, realizing they don't have the capacity to live the lifestyle they want (2 BMW's in the driveway) and refuse to believe it's a systematic problem.
Skewing facts to make a point is the equivalent of using "fake news" to get people to think an intended way. Stay factual and you'll be taken serious.
Wait, cheap + fast + convenient = success?
You show me a source that trump has anything to do with Silsby pre election.
I adjust my mirrors so they point back at them. When I was 18 I had HID'S before they were too common, and had someone adjust their mirror like that. Was the first time I realized I was a dick.

Well industry pays me way more than my government job did, and for less hours and doing the same thing. The only thing I lost out on is vacations.

Why is plastic essential?
There's no correlation between being college educated and being a climate change denier. In fact, deniers are defined as "who has questioned or denied the scientific consensus behind human-caused climate change, individuals who answered climate questions with the “I’m not a scientist” dodge, those who claimed the climate is always changing, and individuals who questioned the extent to which human beings contribute to global climate change, as deniers".\n\n"Educated" people should by virtue be finding themselves questioning such things, even if they come to the conclusion that it is real. Questioning how much of a role we have played is pretty reasonable as well. I won't deny that the climate is changing, or that we are part of the cause, but ruling out all other external causes is, well, rediculous. So while I believe in climate change, I would be defined a denier. Obama's Congress had 63% of americans represented by deniers u der this definition. Only 41% of republicans by the same survey by the Center for American Progress  (which is run by the dems) were found to be deniers, so to say the majority of Trump supporters are this way is just your biased opinion.
It's the "went to school here" parallel. If he turns into a ruthless ignorant dictator running a country without an education system (like as in the DNK and Somalia) you won't see the click bait news lines showing off how he went to school in the US. The US schooling system doesn't ever deserve a mention here...
Breaking news: pollution is bad.
But that's where your wrong. I don't claim the exact impact isn't known, scientists as a collective do. And I've been part of that as a science student at the university of Alberta about a decade ago. I still advocate for change, just because we don't know what the impatient is doesn't detract from the fact that it's bad. And isn't that scary that you have an equal say to a non-American. But do explain why my logic is blisteringly wrong. I see climate change, I've studied it, I advocate for change BUT I also advocate the truth, and we all know how much America hates that.
SHO?
The part of that which is always left out that it is extremely unhealthy. "Smoke this meth and your cold will be gone" turned into "they didn't approve the drug so that they would make more money"
Yeah, Obama held a very important role in the investigation. Get bent buddy, this shit has nothing to do with the president or ex president.
Remember when there was free life saving healthcare in the US?
This isn't about PG investigators, or atleast no such revelations have been made. If your 16 or 17 and have become a prostitute, it's most likely you've had a history of abuse while growing up. This shit isn't normal, it's not good, and I can't understand why you are defending it.
The Clintons have been involved since day 1 with Laura Silsby's human trafficking of kids getting special/immediate attention from the white house. This is all pre email leaks, where most people seem to think the allegations of a pedophile ring started.
Ide take that bet. I doubt we will find out the ages of the kids involved, and maybe your right, 14 might be the youngest (which is still disgusting). Doesn't change the fact that this isn't the media making click bait, they used the exact same terms the various involved law enforcement groups used.
The media doesn't know how old the victims are. The police have not divulged these details to A) protect their identity (they're minors) and b) it could have impacts on an ongoing investigation. All the media knows is from the report given by police. I can tell you that child molestation is referenced. Pimps trying to hire 15yr old girls. Under age girls found that have been report missing for some time. The director of the department of children and family services references a 14 year old girl with a 1 yr old autistic kid.\n\nYou can quit defending these children molesters under the guise of "the media isn't saying they're young, so they must be days from their 18th birthday...". Want to know exactly what the media knows? They watched the video of the press conference, something you have access to on the Internet! Here's a link for you!\nhttps://youtu.be/pXDXB07dRpo now please, for the love of God, go get some help.
What's special about them?
Exactly. Removing a tax in 1 spot detracts from revenue, which will be made up for elsewhere.
As First Lady, Hillary called young black men “super-predators” indicating that she thought all young black males were violent criminals. She also said, “We have to bring them to heel,” like young blacks are the same as dogs.\n\nHilary started the Birther rumours about Obama.\n\nShe's tried to associate with blacks by claiming she keeps a bottle of hot sauce in her purse. She's makes jokes about black people's tardiness,  stood in front of a black church and told them that all lives matter.\n\nShe's married to Bill, who's blatantly racist.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter who you voted for, you voted for a racist.
Well with the likes of GM in their pockets, what else would we expect.
I doubt Trump made his money off his own ideas. He was just the investor. You just sound like a shill.

How is this trump?
Try using anything that isn't oil based for a day. Almost all wet lubricants are oil based, anything greased such as a bearing. The caulk that seals your house or adheres your shingles? The tires on your bicycle. Tape. Ink. We 100% overuse plastic, and it's basically still a relativeky new invention. Fact is, oil isn't just used for gasoline, it in some way makes some part of almost everything we use in a day. Plastic is a cheap substitute for things like metal or paper based materials, it would actually be one of the easier things to drastically reduce.
But walls are bad!
Fair enough, thanks for replying. Thought it was an honest enough question yet I got down voted :P
Not saying it doesn't have its uses that don't have irreplaceable functions, but 99% of plastics are not used for the things mentioned. It's plastic packaging, lids and cups, grocery bags, cheap manufacturing. Almost all of plastics could be replaced with pulp derivatives and metals like aluminum (also light, recyclable, non reactive for the most part). Stones, ceramics It's just a convention that needs to be challenged and would have a higher cost to the consumer. We used to make all of our every day things out of these materials, looking around my desk I remember when my calculator, pens, stapler, garbage can and even phone didn't use plastic to the extent it does now. My plastic chair and bag could be leather again. I have a whiteboard that uses ink and markers instead of caulk. They're nice to haves, but not irreplaceable. For the most part, they don't last like they used to either. They're massive contributors to pollution, a huge percentage of our waste is plastic, and take a look at what's floating in our seas. On another note, synthetic plastics have been around for over 100 years, and there are plastics made from renewable sources but arn't widely used due to cost.    
Still probably cheaper than the rest of the ways the US gets its political influence on outside countries...
Maybe Russia should build a wall
No. Unless the other country says they must denounce it ( which is usually the case)
Being educated and being intelligent don't always go hand in hand.
"Better get rid of those chairs, them darn homeless people might do something pesky, like sit in them."
Couldn't they still intercept it? I think Snowden said the NSA pulls a TB of data every 8 seconds, and that was years ago now. They don't just look through your stuff, they intercept everything and make copies of their own.
Yes, James Alefantis is a nobody. Just a pizza joint owner (and art gallery owner + camping store owner) who happens to be one of top most influencial people in Washington. Heck he was listed as more influencial that Barack Obama's campaign advisor, how the fuck does that happen. But no, he's not an elite... just some ordinary guy who hangs out with Podesta, dated Hilary's David Brock.
It cures dehydration if taken in large enough quantities. 
Yup, need a nice lightweight key. Or you know, cut a piece of lumber into the shape. Punch a piece of aluminium  into it. And guess what, you don't loose the material when you machine it out, that is completely rediculous.\n\nWe have no shortage of leather either. I'm going to assume you're american, which has 29 million cows killed per year. I sincerly doubt there is any shortage of leather, considering that's not the only source of leather. Gone are the days where it has to all be worked by hand too, industry has heavily evolved, just like oil and gas and plastic manufacturing has. Am I against oil and gas? No. Do I agree with OP's assessment that plastic is essential because it's cheap and easy? Well no, because if that was the standard we had to apply then we wouldn't be against coal powered electrical generation (cheapest form).\n
Yep, that's why people voted trump, because of the private email server. That's what the whole scandal was about, the server being private. Way to skew the facts. But sure, voting for Trump is showing how we don't care about people. It isn't the role the Dems played in Iraq, Iran, Syria which has resulted in hundreds of thousands (and by some estimates over a million) casualties, and tens of millions of people displaced. Yes, certainly voting for no change is the non racist, loving option. Quit pretending to have a heart.
That, or you want other benefits like the first time home buyers program.
These are the refugees we want, ones persecuted for celebrating valentines day and showing their love, even when condemned by their "religion of love".
So you've watched the video now and understand your wrong, and still you continue to post. Or you won't watch the video because you know you've been caught. Either way, check mate.
I expect he will stop arming the rebels in Syria. He's talked about it for a long time, since atleast the debates, maybe before.
Your comment history is pretty anti Trump, and you post this without basis or fact. 
You would have a valid argument if those pages said the same thing. They've been inconclusive in determining how large our role has been. And that is certainly not the definition of uneducated.
Well of course their Average is going to be pretty friggin skewed due to the number of tribes that don't cross breed. That doesn't by any standard make a single person who studied in the US the smartest person in the country. Please check your facts for relevancy.
Ko khan hei
If not while in the mood for eating pizza, perhaps before or after? 
Or you go in with everything you want and more, and try to get everything you want.
Yeah... Guess what, despite all these papers, we still don't know how big of a role we have played. No denying that it's happening,  but I challenge you to actually ponder that, and find peer reviewed evidence that explicitly aims to quantify that.
So their spying is interfering with our spying. What a sob story.
I'm not tip toeing around at all. I mean exactly what I've said.\n\n-The climate is changing, as scientists agree. \n\n-Humans have most definitly impacted this, to an extent that we don't know and can't quantify.\n\n-Regardless of how much impact we have had, we live in a relationship with the environment in which we must do what we can to help it. Just as if our spouse was having issues, the focus shouldn't be focused on who is to blame (could be a variety of issues combined, just like this), but how to help him/her overcome it.\n\nEdit: Here's an example of what I mean: http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13335683\n"One of the most worrying features of the Great Acceleration is biodiversity loss," Professor Steffen said. "Species extinction is currently running 100 to 1000 times faster than background levels, and will increase further this century."\n\nI feel I must reiterate this to you: by definition, I, along with many republicans and Democrats (and really this has nothing to do with politics) am labeled a climate change denier (like professor Will Steffen, who is a leader in climate change, I could go on about him, but if your sincerely interested just Google him), because the definition isn't black and white. "... who has questioned or denied the scientific consensus behind human-caused climate change..." Let's remember that most people don't know the definition, and we can't hold that against them. I'm not saying it isn't happening/ hasn't happened. There are people who deny the change completely,  but they get misgrouped with those who simply agree that the scientific consensus isn't real. Yes scientists agree that we impact it, no we don't agree to what extent, and as the article above explains, we can/don't know how to quantify it.
Well, you can't just pay Podesta to help stall out all your court cases and avoid massive fines. I suppose that was BP but it doesn't seem to matter who's in office, the elite will always get away with the same b/s.
She should have to undergo psychiatric evaluation after that and the appeal. While jail wont help her or anyone else, maybe an institute could. Her sentence seems reasonable had no one died.

There was opposition, don't begin conveniently forget it. Last I checked we were supposed to be out in 2014. But since then we've only increased the rate were killing people there, the only difference is we use drones and less of our own bodies.
So, get rid of NAFTA or fix it? I feel trump, as a business man, knows the loopholes and is showing the trade agreement is fucked and needs a serious overhall, though is going about it in a real shitty way.
The Sauds have quite a bit of power over the US and the UN that people really fail to realize. For starters, they are massive contributors to government lobbying groups and spend lots basically on buying political influence by funding campaigns and foundations (ie. The Clinton foundation, or the 140million per month that they donated to the Podesta Group). They also keep alot of our own industry moving. I'm seeing some conflicting numbers but in 2015 we sold the Saudis 115 billion in arms. They're also the recipients of a large number of exotic and high end products like vehicles, which we know these companies seem to have a way of also influencing the government. It's really a matter of he who has the money has the power. If the UN cuts off saudi from selling their oil/making their money, they'll cut us off from alot of the manufacturing and definitly leave a decent wound in our economy.
How old are you? Your a sick fuck if you think 16 is old enough. It's not even about puberty, that's physical development. At 16 you are still very emotionally and intellectually vulnerable. And some kids haven't even hit puberty at this point.
I've watched part of your original video, I think the sound effects of you clicking on different tabs and scrolling is worse than pedophilia... I couldnt even make it half way. If you make more videos, leave out that racket.
Is that against sharia? We'll never know without a judge.
That lowered middle income is just a short term bandage. Our books are so far in the red that it was just a populist thing to do. Our future generations are going to pay the tax burden. It's the exact same as the boomers ruing up deficits on low taxs and now we realize "of shit, CPP is going to run out unless we increase our workforce with migrants or massively increase contributions"
US stops funding reproductive health care internationally and Canada ups it's internal reproductive health care spending?
But you don't buy the land for a pipeline. You just have a caveat or easement. Just think, your house (or someone you know, in the event you don't have your own home) has a gas pipe, a water pipe, a sewage pipe, and possibly more. But those companies never bought that land. I have an acreage and I have a oil line through it, they never gave me a buck.
Doesn't mean we don't do it...
Thanks Washington.
Why is it a question. Why should you maintain your lifestyle when you make a decision to make another mouth to feed. (Notice all the "you's")Like that's totally the government's job to put the spoon in there. Damn government.
Pretty sure if you haven't achieved it it's not your fault, it's that damn 1%!
Because you're abutthole. 
Maybe a pig?
Well you see, we buy guns from the companies that lobby the government to take action in middle eastern countries and destroy them so that we can instill a US friendly government and that equals freedom. /s
Out of curiosity, would reforming the electoral system be enough to convince you to vote someone (liberal or whichever party) as the best candidate to run office?
When was the truth age?
Here I thought all conspiracy theorists were from the right.
We're good at missiles, can't we just ride them everywhere?
Only the non religious educated are exposed to more diverse races and classes? Do you hear what your saying? I won't even touch it, but 48% of college men identify as republican, so there's that...\n\nBut if you actually look at it, the democratic voting populous is heavily black, Asian and Hispanic. It's voter base is very strong in the under $30 000/year, and almost as strong in the under 50k. Since there is a strong correlation between education and earnings, I think your argument is basically moot.
The what now? 
I don't see why this is about the liberals. Headline is misleading, this is an act that occurs annually and, to an extent, without option. These are actions taken by the CRA on debt they  they can't collect, and thus write it off. This is not because they are being generous, as headline would suggest.  
What's with the date 1395-6-29? I presume that's supposed to be when it was posted?
Wasn't there a woman in Texas that did that to five of her kids because she thought they were Satan?
Well, if you've lost 10 cards then that's just ridiculous. You're asking Ventra to provide you for a service that happens to 0.00001% of the population.. . . With you being that 0.00001%\nI suggest you get a card, don't give it to your parents, buy new pants without holes, put your wallet in your front pocket so it doesn't get ripped off and whatever the other 6 reasons you lost your card and you won't have to ask people for suggestions about Ventra not having a solution to your bad luck.\n\nI lost my card once, went to the machine and got a new card, regestired it, got my $5 back and went on my way.....I don't understand the whole deactivating thing.... If your buying a month pass I get it... But with your luck I'd put $20 on it at a time.

No I think he meant the pedos were a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity (a function value or dependent variable) which is determined by another quantity .... \n\nThey are the worst kind of pedos around.
It's being down voted because there are paid shills who are being cornered with evidence and it's getting to the point where people can't ignore it and the MSM are being shown up by internet news feeds.\n\nYou see these fuckers always had the media to down play or completely shun stories like this.. with the advent of Internet journalism stories spread like wild fire and can't be hidden anymore....\n\n\nIt's people like you and me that now have a voice and can make a difference by voicing our opinions.\nStay strong people and show these sick Fucks we're no longer going to be silent.

Shit, $20?... Try getting a CCW permit in Chicago... You'll spend well over $500 in fees, classes and background checks before you can consider carrying.
Was on the el in Chicago and my nose was running all day so instead of just blowing it I took a piece of tissue and shoved it up there...\nAbout an hour later after scoring a jab I promptly snorted two bags, but don't really feel anything...\nI blew my nose and out comes a ball of tissue that's soaked with snot and dope...\n\nWithout thinking twice I swallowed that bitch...\nSo, no... Your not the only person that sees a pot of gold in your snot.
"he was carrying pot and cash"\n\nSo when did it become illegal to carry cash on you?
We already did that years ago with Clinton, Trump mearly talked about women while Clinton was getting head in the oval office and having multiple affairs.... The left likes to forget about slick Willy.
What's with the ear plugs?.. This girl is so full of shit is not even funny. Alters don't change like she does without specific commands from a handler.... \n\nNot just looking at a computer screen and switch on a whim.
My God, how long is the MSM going to ride this Russia bullshit... \n\nJust was watching David Muir and is pounding the Russia having contact with Trump before the election . . This is going on day 10-12 about the same damn thing with literally no proof or evidence at all....\n\n Now they are turning to the did you lie about contact with Russia just to keep this non story alive....\nI'm not a big Trump fan, but, it's so transparent the media is creating Russia hysteria just to screw with him.\n\nI mean we have Hillary who should be imprisoned for her actions and we hear crickets about her now the election is over.\n\nThe hypocrisy is sickening...CNN has been caught time and time again setting up photo ops.. The Iraq interview was one of the greatest f ups of all time with [this beauty](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1LK9a8AT2b8)
Yeah you're right, the only thing we knew about the Clintons before we voted him in office was a shady as shit Governor of Arkansas, was an alleged drug runner and people close to him were ending up committing suicide and dying in some crazy ways.... Compared to Trump, please..... Stop drinking the liberal Kool aid.
Well, I'm a man and am 13% sure the Holocaust was real, I am left handed but I would for sure like to be part of the young Nazis.
Don't forget bringing down governments, drug running, weapons delivery and political assassinations.
She's got a solid reputation. I don't see her screwing her entire life over by posting a fake video on the Internet. Being this is a CT forum you'd think people would be slightly curious. Hastings, Brietbart..to name a few. I would think it's logical to give her a fair hearing no matter who she worked for. If she worked for Breitbart, she'd be attacked on that. In certain circles it's a lose lose situation due to identity politics versus truthfulness. If what happened to her eventually leads back to Clinton & Co. ears gonna click shut and she'll be called a fraud. 
Sort of how fan theories are now?
Cornish Acid is incredible.  The wobble bass I never noticed before even after so many listenings.

This is way better than most college improv marketing videos\n\n\nalso holy shit how are there so many groups on one show?
Had a friend "accidentally" finger the wrong hole of an Indian gal. SRSLY. He was a virgin and working completely in the dark (so to speak) geographically. \n\nAfter a flurry of furious Hindi chatter and a healthy face slap, my friend was sadly still a virgin. I told him, "Dude, virginity is often a game of inches." \n\nI taunted him he'd better study the anatomy map and make a better effort next time or he was going to die a virgin cause Allah never said the jihadi reward was gonna be GIRL virgins. \n#DontDieAVirgin
She's not. Why would you say that? Take her name, Duckduck it and work it out from there.
LOL truth has its own consequences. As we can see by the results of the election :) Enjoy your new president. I surely am!
I completely agree with you. You're lost. My comment is very clear. Obviously Milo as a gay and sexually promiscuous man is going to have gone with older men. It's what gay men do. *at least until they're 29. LOL. \n\nThere's a difference between doing something you want to do and seeking that out, than being coerced intimidated and threatened into it. Yes/no?\n\nStill didn't answer the whole would you go with a super hot teacher for NSA sex. Can't imagine why not :D
I didn't upload the ***** because it's an ethical violation that cannot be undone. I have strong computer security because if one of my MMS is stolen and stuck on TPB the publisher is going to sue my ass as every college student who can would be having free books. I am not going to name the book. That would be absolutely retarded. \n\nBut, to be honest, I was so furious about the bias in the entire book I thought it had to be a joke. Checked with the OS boss, who didn't believe me because that's just not possible. I pulled the pages and emailed them. Jaw drop. So it was before the election that I thought of it and I knew two things. 1. no one would give a shit, and 2. that book would be had for free for ever and there's only so many people that could have done it. So it wasn't worth it.\n\nHowever, that Rotten Core correlation...that's a matter of public or should be, record. However few people actually know what that is or even care. Basically it's a template to make people stupid. \n\nIt's good you research on your own, but I'll tell you this for free. You're getting screwed. I watched the quality just crash. I am also really good at information analysis. I was DevEd on a book, great project lots of potential actually interesting work. I'm overseas when I start this project. Less than an hour into it I'm on the phone in a fury. The author had plagiarized the entire first chapter. My spidey senses were tingling so I started googling sentences. OH MY GOD. The author did not write chapter two (I made a big report about each thing), and so forth. So I get back in the states and have a big meeting at the publishers (ALL of whom know I have no degree, just genius lol) anyway, they're flabbergasted. How did this get by all the PhD acquisition agents? Then in a panic the pubs actually asked me to write the book. To put it this way the book was a multi subject (chemistry, biology ect) very specialized book. I could not believe my ears.  They asked me to write the book. I don't even. So I sit with them and explain that WHOOEE yes I'm smart...but the competition book is all heavy duty biology/chemistry Phds and I don't chemistry or math at all. Ever. I'm allergic. I'm pretty sure you don't want me to write that. First I COULD write it, but it would take me a very long time to research it and learn it and I hate it.\n\nThe publisher (no small player) was freaking TIME TIME DEADLINES WAAA. I agree to write one chapter that I was excellent in the subject matter. That chapter would end up being the design/reviewer chapter. They hired a science house to write the rest of the book. To this day my work is in that book unattributed, as is the rest of the entire book. The man's name on the book had ZERO to do with writing the book. Not one person who actually wrote that book has their name on it.\n\nSo when I say I know education is bad, I know it's bad. I was so happy to see school choice. Now poor inner city kids who want to learn, can get out of an environment where they're made fun of or bullied for it. Also makes schools do better. Have you read "No Thug Left Behind"? That's it. \n\nI'm currently working on something that the "candidates" must have worked so very hard on. It's like reading Fantasy Island. Absolutely terrifying that this is the work of a group who are getting a PhDs. \n\nI also had the "pleasure" of working on an analysis of the TPP. I do not know what "brain" power conceived of that, but the very idea that it (the TPP) made it as far as it did makes me question the nature of my reality. So many horrific Phd publications come across my desk that I fear i know exactly the state of education in the U.S. and the world. If anything is a conspiracy, the dumbing down of the World is a good one. We are truly in a state of devolution. Approaching the Idiocracy at Mach 9.\n\nWhen you get around to publishing, please don't make your heads a paragraph long. And can it be filled more with your own ideas and hypothesis, methods etc. that paragraphs of the ideas of others in parenthesis? The current "it's ok to have a new idea as long as 50 other people had it and wrote about it first" bullshit stymies new ideas. Some of them think that if they can just make enough citations they won't have to write enough about their own ideas. They can't write about Blah because no one else has ever written or studied blah before. Please, (PLEEEASEEE) make it more interesting than trying to concoct an entire universe of globalization fantasy that forgets there's a real world outside the classroom. That's the hot ticket now--globalization. People who think they're smarter than everyone else locked in the sainted politicized halls of academia (politics in academics...why?) sit about and think of stupid shit that's going to solve all our problems. \n\nEngineer? I could forgive the conigitive dissonance if it was engineering. That's a concrete thinking field of study. Please not Gender Studies.\n\n
Post covered in red=EPIC troll. And they didn't "get it" lol.
And this is why the "left" can't get elected to dog catcher. \n\nYou forgot to call me a racist, xenophobe, and bigot. Please correct your error.
It has nothing to do with women. Teen aged girls learn about pussy power and exercise it. Often to the detriment of young men who are less mature emotionally. They are wicked in their pursuit of sexual expression because they figure out they have what all the boys want (except the gay ones of course) and while it may be a part of growing up, to deny that that seeking behavior is harmful to the victims is just ignorant. \n\nAll the screaming about that but nothing about this?\n\nhttps://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/professors-staff-arrested-for-trading-in-child-rape-6c39fcf62a9e#.88wmbs51u
Is it just me or was the sign guy being interviewed the same swishy whiny ass professional crier that was on Tucker last night? The one would couldn't answer the most simple question "What are you afraid Trump is going to do to you?" 
ANOTHER fucking riot. Malmo has been a shithole no go zone for ages. Swedes been cruising the river of denial for years.
Admit it, you'd click that!
> But if the organization starts heaping praise on the guy, I would definitely be concerned.\n\nWhich would be a great strategy if they wanted people to suspect him. 
LOL OMG in grad school. Enough said. \n\nI think we can all agree that the Russian Women's Gymnastic Team is often gender neutral.\n\nI was sexually active by 14. I was also a pedo victim. I know the difference. If you don't then perhaps you'll be good enough to defer to people who do.\n\n/r/Igotoschoolforaliving
Hirjah is jihad by invasion/migration. That's been the plan for years.\n\nOne does wonder how they're going to fund it now that Obama and Hillary et al aren't funding them anymore. This leaves Saudi and Soros holding the bag.

Perhaps the poor soul is unaware that the day after the Bataclan attack (using guns) the French raided Mosques around the country and recovered more guns in one day than they did for an entire year.\n\nThat being said, if the poor thing is a male it wasn't that unsafe in the ghetto..unless he resembles a goat, a 4 year old or drops the soap.
Well, that added to the conversation. You don't irony do you. LOL
Couldn't help but note you didn't comment on the corruption and political maneuvering in academia. I'm fairly certain that the utter nonsense that passes for academic thinking that comes across my desk has nothing to do with that. Directed intelligence. Correct thinking, and complete lack of connection to the real world.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/professors-staff-arrested-for-trading-in-child-rape-6c39fcf62a9e#.88wmbs51u\n\nAcademia is every bit as much a corrupt swamp as anything else. 
Thanks. Not sure why they call it common sense. It's really not common :(
I wish they could just tell me so I  can decide if I also need to be afraid. I could be missing something...(hey it could happen) but no one wants to tell me :( 
One does wonder why the media overlooked the three sexual harassment lawsuits filed against Obama and a matter of public record. How did such a man even get elected eh? Especially since he's a "married man" and the lawsuits were filed by...men.\n\nOne might start to get a bit suspicious over what is conveniently ignored and what the real agenda is. If one is a real CT theorist that is.
RU my brother from another mother? That's devilishly brilliant DO EEET.
>  that the night you turn 18 the magic sex fairy comes and sprinkles sexuality dust on you.\n\nWait, wut? This doesn't actually happen? REEEEE THEY LIED TO MEEEE!
There are WAY too many white pills in that photo. SRSLY it's like...black pills don't exist :(
We need to be talking about this. Look it's stupid that two teens sexting each other get sex offender status. Just as stupid as a 18 year old going to jail because he turned 18 and his long time GF is 16 and her parents went after him. We need to acknowledge teen sexuality and help them do better rather than making them the victim every single time. OR putting them in jail for normal behavior. And we really need to look at why it is a promiscuous teen girl who should know better can get away with putting a man in jail and on the sex offender list by lying about her age. That's not fair either.\n\nYou never answered what you'd do, the truth...if a super hot teacher came on to you and offered you oddles of NSA sex.\n\nHe was 14, so was I. However I was only six when a pedo went for me. There is a difference. That needs to be part of the conversation.\n\nFlinging pooh doesn't help people understand each other. Anyone who doesn't understand gay culture, for example (although younger people seem to be doing ok with that) probably won't realize that there are as many promiscuous gay men as there are straight promiscuous girls and they get started young. Not judging it, so did I, but I was selective at least.
He didn't look all that successful at it. I thought dicks got hard...that one was barely hardish.
Have you looked up her work? And I really don't think we need to get into the "journalist standards" of Newsweek (prepublished Hillary as winner) as there apparently aren't any. 
Are these people who would have been in day care back when that shit started? Idiots. SRLSY. They'd be better off being outraged cause Charmin really isn't softer.
That's a great start...then maybe also the hollywood stars that just praised the pedo rapist Polanski on stage. Meryl Streep love Polanski but has an issue with Trump? Rob Reiner is likely Cory Haim's first rapist. \n\nMilo knows where the bodies are buried in Hollywood. He mentioned the party he went to there were a LOT of young boys. HE knows who was there...I say Milo mi amor, time to start flapping those jaws and making a suicide "insurance" video. There's nothing left to lose!
Heh, that movie. We turned that around beautifully didn't we! 
FUCCCCKKKK when am I going to believe what you fucktards say? \nJust trolling I think...he's just trolling...then I click.\n\n\nSpread it. (BTW that pud he was yanking didn't seem hard...barely hardish. WTF? He didn't find George sexy?)
Why can't you just answer the question? It's not loaded. Surely your lot has a better grasp of GamerGate than I do. Attempting to discover if the entry is biased..attempting to discover the truth or wider perception of the incident as portrayed in this paper. And you won't answer me? Because I'm doing exactly what you claim I don't?\n\nI'm pretty sure why you won't answer :) But that's ok. The section has to go as it presents only one unsourced/unproven POV as fact and is clearly biased in favor the the feminine perspective. 
You know what I meant. Hot teacher when you were student.\n\nAnd if you didn't get Milo's statement, you might be listening to fake news. LOL it's basically what I said.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/\nmyiannopoulos/posts/851263248344905\n\n>Here is Milio's response.\n\n>A note for idiots (UPDATED):\nI do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a co-ordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.\n\n>If it somehow comes across (through my own sloppy phrasing or through deceptive editing) that I meant any of the ugly things alleged, let me set the record straight: I am completely disgusted by the abuse of children.\nSome facts to consider:\n\n>1. I have outed THREE pedophiles in my career as a journalist. That's three more than any of my critics and a peculiar strategy for a supposed pedophile apologist.\n(a) Luke Bozier, former business partner of Louise Mensch\n[link to kernelmag.dailydot.com]\n[link to kernelmag.dailydot.com]\n(b) Nicholas Nyberg, anti-GamerGate activist who self-described as a pedophile and white nationalist\n[link to www.breitbart.com]\n(c) Chris Leydon, a London photographer who has a rape trial starting March 13 thanks to my reporting.\n[link to www.breitbart.com]\n\n>2. I have repeatedly expressed disgust at pedophiles in my journalism.\n[link to www.breitbart.com]\n\n>3. I have never defended and would never defend child abusers, as my reporting history shows. The world is messy and complicated, and I recognize it as such, as this furore demonstrates. But that is a red line for any decent person.\n\n>4. The videos do not show what people say they show. I *did* joke about giving better head as a result of clerical sexual abuse committed against me when I was a teen. **If I choose to deal in an edgy way on an internet livestream with a crime I was the victim of that's my prerogative. It's no different to gallows humor from AIDS sufferers**.\n\n>5. National Review, whose journalists are tweeting about this, published an article defending Salon for giving a pedophile a platform.\n\n>6. I did say that there are relationships between younger men and older men that can help a young gay man escape from a lack of support or understanding at home. That's perfectly true and every gay man knows it. But I was not talking about anything illegal and I was not referring to pre-pubescent boys.\n\n>7. I said in the same "Drunken Peasants" podcast from which the footage is taken that I agree with the current age of consent.\n\n>8. I shouldn't have used the word "boy" when I talked about those relationships between older men and younger gay men. **(I was talking about my own relationship when I was 17 with a man who was 29. The age of consent in the UK is 16.) That was a mistake. Gay men often use the word "boy" when they refer to consenting adults. I understand that heterosexual people might not know that, so it was a sloppy choice of words that I regret.**\n\n>9. This rush to judgment from establishment conservatives who hate Trump as much as they hate me, before I have had any chance to provide context or a response, is one of the big reasons gays vote Democrat.\n\n>10. In case there is any lingering doubt, here's me, in the same interview the other footage is taken from, affirming that the current legal age of consent is about right: "And I think the law is probably about right. It's probably roughly the right age. I think it's probably about ok. **But there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age. I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who were sexually active younger. I think it particularly happens in the gay world, by the way."**\n\nCarry on. 
> these did idiots not think\n\nThink being the operative word. They're like Wile E. Coyote. Perpetually squished by perpetually bad plans, but never give up trying. (They still don't know Wile E. never caught the Roadrunner..>BEEP BEEP)\n\n
> GetComponent is expensive. But just make sure you are not calling it every frame or lots and lots of times in a row, and you should be fine.\n\nThis is really helpful advice. Thank you for this.  It seems like something I'd want to avoid in general, but your recommendation makes sense. 
First, consider whether you really need a new format. 
Right after the election I had told some friends that we dodged a bullet. If it had been Hillary we would be at war with Russia. A war we cannot possibly win, and perhaps by design. (Obama decimated the military and the leadership.) By electing Trump we were still going to have "war" but it would be internal, and as a society asleep at the wheel happily and blindly consuming but conveniently ignoring the actions of our government, it was time to clean up our act and pay the piper. I told them that "THEY" would not go quietly into that dark night as there was too much at stake. They laughed at me then. They're not laughing now.\n\nWhether or not a person is on the Trump train, there is plenty of freely available information to expose to anyone who actually cares to look, what a vile POS our government is.\n\nI can be a proud American as a person, and still be faithful to the values that helped make us a formerly free country, have faith in most of my fellow Americans..that they too would want the corruption exposed, our war mongering and perpetual interference to be ended. For us to actually BE our words. WOW was I wrong. I'm witnessing people so devoted to tearing things apart that the truth has become revolutionary. Up is down, black is white, good is evil. I feel like I've entered into Bizarro World.\n\nNo matter our personal feelings we should be working together to solve this instead of attacking each other.\n\nI cannot honestly (and I've tried) find anything Trump has ever said or done in his entire life, that will ever come close to be as evil as the email telling Hillary to embrace the murder of Qaddafi and destruction of Libyia all the way to the White House to prove she's tough. \n\nWTF? We have destroyed Libya, for what? What was our right to do that? They've been playing games with our lives and getting away with it for much too long and our gullibility in blindly following where ever they told us to go is ridiculous. \n\nWhat possible excuse can anyone offer for hating Trump more than they hate the lies we've been fed?\n\nWe had the "left" screaming about rape culture, slut shaming, body shaming,..who then turned around and attacked Melania Trump for having been a drop dead gorgeous super model, marching with "Rape Melania" signs..now rape is good.\n\nWe had the "left" publishing VERY pro pedophilia articles, no one said a word when Lena talked about sexually abusing her sister, no worries, no shame...then Milo talks about being sexually abused in a way that's easiest for him to express it, and suddenly he's a dangerous pedo and they hate pedos.\n\nNo matter what it is, no matter if it's true, it will be attacked and retrofitted because someone hates Trump.\n\nI watched Tucker try to get this Nevertrump protest guy to actually explain why he's afraid of Trump. I'm still waiting to hear why people are choosing to be terrified of Trump.  Trump got elected because he promise to enforce our immigration laws. This is a good thing. If that pisses people off, so be it. I wouldn't get any "mercy" being illegal in Mexico. Open Borders? How is it open borders if the traffic is only one way? The last thing Mexico wants is open borders. \n\nThe political asshattery is off the charts. The mayor of my city went public stating we were a sanctuary city. That's a lie. They're nabbing illegals left and right. I was SO happy to discover that the 2 times deported felon that robbed me and a friend was caught..and immediately shipped out. This time he won't be coming back. I'm happy about that.\n\nCalifornia spends 25billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. They rioted, screamed, made plans to exit the union. And have had the NERVE to blame the flooding on Trump and demand federal dollars. I realize the bulk of the area flooding is red zones, which does cause one to wonder if the neglect to that area was purposeful. They don't need a high speed train. They need to fix their infrastructure and clean the trash out of their crime ridden ghettos. I heard a Senator the night they evacuated Orville the first time, actually turn it into Trump's fault. He said something like "Well Mr. President, instead of deporting immigrants maybe you should be building us a new dam". I about dropped my teeth. I'm MORE than pleased our President has not said a word about California. He released FEMA funds, but I surely hope he never says another word. The destruction alone that California has committed upon itself needs to rest firmly on the head of Californians who got all cozy with the way things were, and just let it all ride. Now is the time to pay the piper for being asleep at the wheel. And the nerve of that state threatening the rest of the country because like petulant children they didn't get their way. Good riddance. 
Unsure why your duckduck is broken, but\n\nhttp://www.fairus.org/news/illegal-immigration-costs-california-taxpayers-more-than-25-billion-a-year-finds-fair
No actually seeking an opinion. I know nothing about GamerGate, but the slant and means in which it was used seemed slightly biased. That often happens when people are trying to shape a narrative. The author did not provide for any other view. It was if the author knew for certain Zoe was not guilty as charged. I am uncertain how that is possible unless the author was personally there. That's why I'm asking. I think that section is biased towards the POV of the author and the POV being pushed.\n\nIf you don't know about GG or hold any opinions just say so.
I hear he's rather fond of Portugal. 
I do believe Trump did away with that bathroom asshattery today :) 
What a well-thought out and intelligent response. I was medicated out my ass and made a better argument.
LOL. Thank you for the intelligent discourse. \n\nUnlike the current generation, I earned my trophies by actually winning :D
> one of the worst looking dicks \n\n\nOMG I thought it was just men. That was not a happy looking dick. Apparently getting a hard dick has a lot to do with who be hold'n.\n
It's insider footage. So how do you recommend people who don't have 20 hours a day to watch endless useless footage when the sauce is contained in 2 hours total? Is the only way anyone can assert the footage is valid by watching all 1000 hours? Or is it OK to watch a compilation of the damning evidence?
Listen to the stupid swedish reporter and tucker. He gives the per year numbers from the site, rather than a calculated over all rise.\n\nThey could also have deleted it.
I dunno but I'd love to do a survey of how many redpilled from the start millennials were raised by their parents v. daycare. Daycare has to create a socialized environment to keep order rather than meet the need of individuals. 
Au contraire...having actually met and dealt with too many Moslims has completely changed my view of them...from harmless well meaning  people, to organized, vicious, and sneaky ass bastards.

Nah, he's guilty of something he thinks his screaming and attacks will hide...but what?
>  she turned over two pages in her media packet and thought she was supposed to start talking about it before they'd actually carried it out.\n\nYou do realize the only mistake she made was leaving out the word "Attempted" massacre, right? Because they were caught before they blew the fuck out of everyone. Why has it become necessary to distort things to this extent? \n\nHaving been in France multiple times for lengthy periods starting in 2003 to 2012, I know what I saw and how things are and how my friends in the south feel about Moslims. The reality of how things are and how they're represented in the media are so night and day as to really make one question the motive. \n\nFACT. My friends in the South are as loaded and locked as possible within French laws. They've been living with this shit for much longer as many Arabs settled there during the African evacuations. One evening at dinner is about all the time anyone is going to need to find out how they really feel.\n\nAnyone telling you these people integrate and improve over time is lying. They actually get worse because they are not intelligent enough in general to integrate or do well in school to progress. This makes them angrier. \n\n There's a few here and there but by and large the Moslim community is violent, retaliatory, and the reason the French people don't speak up is they're afraid of being prosecuted for hate speech. My Paris friends were furious when the no go zone conversation started. They defended it..calling it a lie. They know it's true, they're just ashamed to admit the depths of their gullibility. It was willful blindness--if we keep saying it's not real maybe it won't be. After Stuttgart they've swallowed the entire bottle of redpills. I used to get amused/confused when I talked about the no go zones and people would call me a liar. It's really disconcerting. You know what you saw and experienced and yet they're telling you it's a lie.\n\nAnyone who doubts them, please do take a female into a no go coffee shop and have her attempt to order. That's if you don't get run the fuck off just for entering. \n\nIt boggles my mind that people struggle to believe this is real, and that people have been Stockholm Syndromed into silence. Before my first visit in 03 it had never entered my mind to even wonder about Islam. Now I'm like...this shit doesn't belong in the West. They need to evolve at their own pace and Western "kindness" and naivete is going to destroy them. They are uncivilized in their own countries, were they supposed to suddenly become civilized merely by crossing a border?\n\nMy last long-term visit was in '12. I will not be returning. They've bred to mass numbers and are taking over more and more areas. If I wanted to visit the Middle East and "experience their culture" I'd go there. As it is the perpetually unemployed and extremely low intelligence Kebabs sit around all day drinking coffee, smoking the hookah, verbally and physically assaulting any female within distance, and plotting their next move.\n\nThe French have been surrendering since about 845 when the Vikings first arrived. Not really notorious warriors here folks.
> Nah, I'm content with just calling you a pedophile advocate and sympathizer today. \n\nAH, the logic of the left. \n\nIf I wrote that I hated child rape you'd be duty bound to love it.\n\nTry to get to the racist, xenophobe, bigot stuff tomorrow. But don't forget to preclude it with pedophile. You're calling someone who has actually been abused by a pedophile, a pedophile.\n\nNew depths of resonate disconnect, you're probing them.\n\nSo, for about ten posts you've refused to answer this question, why?\n\n>Would you have sex with an uber hot teacher if it were NSA, consensual and no one would ever know. \n\nSeems sort of disingenuous not to answer that. LOL but I do understand why you haven't.
Someone else did. So it's getting a few more eyes today.
You do realize the government of Sweden has been vigorously covering up the crime rate/rape issue, right? So, you're expecting the PM of Sweden to say what? in response? You did do due diligence and actually looked, right? Youtube has thousands of videos. Sweden is 100% purdee fucked. It cannot be saved. Can you even wrap your mind around how far gone they are? Now it's OK that a girl married at 12 and 2 kids at 14...the rape is off the charts. Is it OK that a guy grabs and rapes a 4 year old boy so hard he's in hospital, but the gov. says it's OK, he didn't know better. Maybe they're embarrassed at their horrific failure. Maybe they're afraid to agree now. You do know that when Moslimes get pissed they riot and blow shit up, right? They are one of the most volatile dangerous groups of people on the planet. Only fools think they can change what must be allowed to evolve naturally and in it's own time.\n\nDid you hear about the case in Minnesota? You probably didn't. A grandmother looking for her grandchild found her. The disabled child was on the floor in the laundry room of the complex. Standing over her were 4 "rapefugee" children. 14, 12, 11, 8 (or there 'bouts). They gang raped the child, the 8 year old couldn't ejaculate so he peed on her. Nothing happened to them. The story was covered up. NOTHING happened to them. \n\nThese people live a life style that is incompatible with our Constitution, and everything we used to hold dear. I heard American women scream ALLAHU AKBAR at the women's march, they were cheering for Linda Sansour a well-known advocate of sharia law and BFF to Hamas, they cheered for Donna Hilton's speech, and she, a convicted murderer, who murdered her victim by shoving a metal pipe up his ass and because he "wiggled" he was gay, assured me I've just entered the Twilight Zone. \n\nAnd they're afraid of Trump?\n\nDoes any of this make sense to you? How is it possible that that actually happened? \n\nRemember when the mayor of Paris threatened to sue Fox Fox? for talking about the no go zones? I flipped the fuck out. There are countless no go zones in France, and they are terrifying places. Of course this is no longer a secret. They aren't building a wall around the Eiffel Tower to protect it from indigenous French people. Paris, Mon France, is now a shit hole.\n\nThe no go zone in London I accidentally wandered into freaked me the fuck out. If I wish to experience Middle Eastern culture at that scale I'll go to the Middle East. However seeing women completely clad in black tied to a rope being led down the street by a young boy was mind blowing. London. Not Saudi, London.\n\nApparently he watched the Tucker Carleson show on the rape/violence in Sweden "last night". \n\nI think what you're struggling with is this "why would any country do this to themselves?"\n\nTo answer that one you'll need to study up on a lot of things. But long story short is the people in Sweden, are our grown up snowflakes. They've had this sweet cozy life, such good hearted kind people. A quiet non violent society...going to save the poor poor underprivileged and give them the good life.\n\nSurely anyone would be happy to come live in Sweden and become Swedish. The brit who coined the word Islamaphobia, apologized to the world. His excuse was "I thought they'd assimilate". \n\nThat isn't how it is. The west has a lot to answer for re-Middle East, but the actions/policies and damage were ACTUALLY perpetrated by everyone BUT Donald Trump. Including Hillary Clinton. But the one thing you cannot ever do is force/rush social change in places that have low intelligence as the norm and are inherently tribal. A quick read on tribalism should have disabused any of the Swedes from even trying it. But they did.\n\nAnyone who has spent any time in those environments know that bringing them to the west would only create ghettos. Germany thought they'd get cheap labor. And they're pushing interbreeding. These are not smart people. They aren't even smart enough for the most part to do menial work. This is the truth. We can see that all around us. that Somalian that murdered people in Columbus was shipped from Tribal Somalia with his mom and 7 brothers and sisters. given free everything, FREE. Paid for nothing. But my guess is his anger and frustration reverted to tribal violence when he just couldn't do the work. There are really serious issues in forcing cultures to come together without any type of assimilation.\n\n\nSo, what's the agenda? WHY are governments going out of their way to hide this? Because they are. \n
>  Glad I decided to check out the other side. \n\nDid you just assume our side?\n\n\n\n/s
Confused. How are they planning on discovering how anyone voted? Is there a test? Do people actually want to buy their shit anyway or this a publicity ploy for a company no one's ever heard of and they're getting free advertising?
I do believe that came from the Hillary camp originally. However there's enough question about who the fuck Obama even is and how on earth he got elected with three sexual harassment lawsuits filed and settled on his behalf...by men.\n\nIf you're going to be CT theorist you're pretty much duty bound to tear apart both sides. Have you seen the fake PDF birth certificate? The White House forgot to "merge layers" LOL. I don't know who he is or where he's from, I'm just really really glad he's finally gone.
HEH. I read that and I was like...excellent work. It's stinkypete level right there...A wordsmith :)
I have an original pre-pi model I bought years ago.  Are they rare or something? I had no idea. 
His commentary just...well good thing he's not white eh?\n\nI only get paranoid with weed if I'm worried about something. But I've pretty much got that worry thing beat. Someone got furious with me over the California damn thing. Like what? I'm supposed to become emotionally overwrought and fall into a steep decline over the fact that California completely fucked their citizens while the citizens said THANK YOU. Hollywood is one creepy as fuck place and a small well-placed earthquake could eliminate at least 50% of American's mental health issues in about 5 minutes. Was out there for some official business and was shocked at how gross, run down, and creepy things were. One has this image of Sunset Blvd. as some glamorous place...the movies must CGI it because it's bums pissing on the streets and would be stars walking around wearing "I'm pathetic notice me" clothes. TruFax..saw a teenaged girl parading about wearing no pants and see through pantyhose.\n\nI used to live out there and when I left I decided I'd never go back because living where you can actually see the air probably isn't a good idea. \n\nAnyway actions have consequences. And fiddling while Rome burns and acting all superior isn't helping their cause. If my house flooded I'd be like..fuck, why did I buy a house in a flood plain...not FUCCCK CALIFORNIA OWES ME. You Owe Me Politics! \n
I both love and hate stuff like this. I want video damn it :D
Oh, yes. I tend to be naive about those things. LOL Thanks.
When the BC was first put on the white house site, countless Adobe experts made videos exposing the layer goof. Literally anyone with photoshop could DL it and see for themselves. \n\nI watched the latest where they actually found the BC that Obama's was based on. Fuddy's death is a bit too convenient as well. I love a great TFH story, but sometimes, they're not just stories.\n\nIf they had a BC why on earth would they bother to do this?  I do not understand why it's so "revolutionary" and hateful to actually question where Obama popped out of. The social security numbers alone should raise questions.\n\nEven worse is I was making fun of the "tranny" shit, but at this point I'd love an explanation as to why there is zero evidence anywhere that Michelle Obama ever gave birth to anyone and how the fuck is it possible that the doctor who delivered her "home births" and her husband are the spitting image of the two girls. I don't know if people photoshopped the images to make them look MORE alike than they did...but back when she gave birth it was not the done thing to be attended at home by a doctor..twice. I saw that photo of the kids with the doc and her husband and I stopped laughing. I have no explanation for that one except the obvious. I can claim the photos have been altered or I can accept it. Or both. (question everything)\n\nIt seems incredible that I'm even speaking of this, but damn, sometimes you have to look even when it seems stupid to do so.
I thought the clams got hold of her. Damn, now the Moslims taking the "convert a D list celebrity" page straight out of the Clam direction manual. ($cientology).
Serious question. GamerGate. Did Zoe only gain success by sleeping with people or did she gain it on her own. I don't know anything about it as it was of no  interest to me, but a paper I'm working on today used it as an example of sexism in the digital arts without and real references except those that support the author's opinion. Did she or didn't she? 
I UV without looking. I swear. Once is enough. JAYSUS President Trump's interview with Stern was like--kindergarten level naughty. \n\nI am pleased to see the dick owner appears to be over 30.
Better headlines "Man Suggests Using Catapults for Illegal Aliens".
Since so many Trump haters have turned out to be guilty of shit, I'm wondering why the Weaponized Autists don't figure out what he's hiding. No way is he clean. I saw Farenheit 411, it was excellent. What has he done and who has he done it to. 
in context I saw the whole thing, and he's not said a thing different than he ever has. He knows the difference between pedophilia and sexually active teens. He's also inflammatory. \n\nThis is a conversation that needs to be held, not attacked. I hope it has a chance to get started before it ends. I have no doubt that Milo is going to have quite the conversation about it. Fire them up, and get them talking. 
There's some interesting comments about Seaman in the comment section.\n\nHere's another video. Affair during 2012 election by presidential candidate. BRB going for extra sauce.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6okXTtfRn2Y

That's just it, though. Many people take jobs that don't involve heavy machinery that use it medically. This casting of a wide net because companies  don't understand nuances causes a lot of problems. If there was a way of allowing it for certain jobs, then many people would have a better quality of life.  \n\nTreating all marijuana users as irresponaible stoners is akin to saying everyone that drinks is doing frat-house style Jaeger Bombs.  
Party Over Everything\nPOE\n\nEOP\n \nEssence of Purity\n\nMandrake, I'm onto something. Have you ever heard of a thing called fluoridation?\n
If you're unable to back away from your mirror of perpetual discontent, you'll never figure it out. \n\nSo let's pretend you're correct, and Trump is one big conspiracy. What makes you think they'll do anything about his horrific corruption when we've had nothing but unhindered corruption in the White House since Kennedy was assassinated? What's your big plan here, the long game? I mean, if McCain can get pardoned by Nixon (don't need a pardon if you didn't commit a crime, right?) and Nixon merely resign, and the 7th floor literally running the show for years...what's the plan?\n\nIt's a conspiracy. Trump did in one day what CT people have been trying to do and being laughed off the stage for trying to do for over 50 years. IN ONE DAY the entire country was talking about the Shadow Government, and then they got fired. He did what no one else has been able to do. Ever. JFK died after his shadow government speech. And oddly one of his relations, the vile and corrupt Patrick Kennedy is the top dog of the "7th floor'.\n\nI know, I know, it's part of George Soros's big plan to...wait...what's his plan? Wide open borders, forced "multiculturalism" reduced population...one world government. He's probably going to fire Trump now. Asshole Trump went off the rails and closed borders, ended harmful immigration, and is putting American interests first. Fuck, he really tricked Soros. \n\nIt's a conspiracy against conspiracies? FUUUUCKKK it's a conspiracy against corruption. WEEPING tears of sorry here, literally shaking.\n\nNo, wait, Trump exposed the Shadow Government? NOOO WE LOVE the shadow government. This shit's got to stop.\n\nThe media and libtards have done nothing but attack Trump. Marching with rape Melania signs, attacking a 10 year old kid, slandering a beautiful, strong, businesswoman because she's his daughter. Non stop. Physically attacking "Trump supporters" faking attacks, birddogging, illegal shit from one end to the other. And instead of thinking...maybe the sum of all things doesn't equal what I think it does, you just keep screaming the same illogical nonsense.\n\nHillary got a shit ton of money from countries that literally murder gays, notoriously hates gay men, but she talks reeel purdy, and stood by her rapist husband. Has done nothing but break the law most of her life.\n\n It's like half of the country doesn't believe we deserve better.\nThe other half still thinks Bernie is a good guy and he can still win.
I don't need any "sorry". I'm not delicate. I just hate to see legitimate issues all be sucked into the OMG PEDO category. \n\nTo have my wanted life confounded with unwanted life by people who cannot or refuse to understand the difference is irritating as it's always accompanied by the "I know best" virtue signaling and judgement.\n\nPedophilia is violence, threats, force, and intimidation. It has nothing to do with want. If Milo was a sexually promiscuous teen as he claims, then who the hell cares who he slept with? If he was a victim of power-based trust violations, or violence, threats, force and intimidation, then that's a different story. I have gay friends who were raped as adults, violence is an issue no matter your age or orientation. \n\nWould you feel "faint" if I told you I write/edit/ etc the books you use in school? What if I told you I didn't have any degree at all, but a PhD is normally required however I'm naturally talented genius! Dream job, telecommute. I'm in a really great position to know what asshattery is currently taught in schools. *****Book I just worked on was due Nov. 8th. It was so full of shit I almost leaked it to Wikileaks. Bias, misdirection, and some flat out lies, including an entire section dedicated to the glorious election of our amazing first female president. Called Ferguson peaceful....no citations, and the civil rights section was so incredibly wrong that one does wonder what the agenda is. I completely understand why the "youth" don't understand the Constitution as the author paid it scant attention. The book was more about what he thought the Constitution should be, rather than what it is. Cleverly twisted and biased.\n\nAnd Rotten Core...OMG. So grateful our new Secretary of Education is going to ditch that shit. I just finished something that was so incomprehensibly stupid...I should upload that to Wikileaks. \n\nYou only think you're getting a good education but that's an illusion. You're getting a "directed" education. The trophy generation never learned to fail. Everyone got passing grades and told they too were a rocket scientist..which is why recently a first year med student got arrested for putting bleach in his baby's bottle--because it would help stop her bellyache. Not everyone is smart enough to be a doctor. I'm smart enough to know I should never design an airplane.\n\n From the shit that comes across my desk, especially the "papers", I truly fear for the world. I see too little applied logic and way too much OMG emotion. Who gets mad enough about an election to rampage in the streets? It's like...mind boggling.
The shot heard round the world. I can hear my based French friends cheering this one and replaying it over and over. Who wants to meet with someone who calls themselves the "Grand Muffti" is that like being Grand PooBah?
Damn you guys. First I'm a pedo now I'm homophobic.\n\nWould it be fair to say that stories existed about Obama's time in Hawai'i and the MSmedia just didn't cover it? Does that make the story untrue? If a story is shoved out and suppressed, is it automatically fake news?\n\nHomophobic because I despise hypocrisy? One of our recent Republican presidential candidates (actually two but only one I can swear on the Bible to in a court of law) is queer as a three dollar bill. he married to further is political career.  He's 100% blackmailable like Obama the idiot puppet was. Being in a position of "power" and having dank secrets like that has zero to do with homophobia and everything to do with being the puppet of anyone holding it over your head.\n\n\nWhat constitutes "proof" to you? CNN? MSNBC? The National Enquirer published the story about John Edwards and his mistress / love child when no other media outlet would touch it. It was true, yes/no? They have covered a lot of things that were actually true that no one else would touch. It's actually clever. \n\nHave you ever listened to Mia Maria Pope outing Obama's teen years in Hawai'i?\n\nWhy didn't she get sued? Suing her would draw attention to the issue. Barry must understand the Streisand Effect.\n\nAnd since no other media even touched it, it must be a lie.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW_LfOiWDQI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoIRWJt-iKE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyR-fWmjQME\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GMSAO4BKU\n\nThe MSM should have actually investigated and had her on and openly discredited her story. Crickets.\n\n\nThen this\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kbhkFrrxNs\n\nhttp://larrysinclair.com/about-me/\n\n\nThe point is, when Politicians are dishonest about who they are, they are wide open for blackmail.\n\n(Please do better or you're not going to get your participation trophy. you forgot to include the following in your intelligent response--bigot, racist, xenophobe, and Islamaphobe.)
Let me ask you something. What lost world are you in that it's OK to blame your violence on words? My words can't make you do anything. YOU decide what to do. It's a complete and total lack of personal responsibility. "I blew up your house because YOU insulted me". WTF kind of logic is that?\n\nMalmo has been a shithole no go zone for years. This is not a one off happening. Go there, discover the peaceful Moslims for yourself. 
Funny how every snowflake "dude" is sporting a man bun and BCGs!
We're not stopping at one. Every Hollywood star that stood on the stage and praised the rapist is going to get this treatment.
So you can't wrap your head around the fact that Obama had three sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him by men and it can't be true because the MSM didn't report it.\n\nThat's the same excuse someone else used re the emails. Can't be true, if something was true CNN would report it.\n\nThere's more than one way to get a story out there. Obama is gay and  a fucking hypocrite. There's a reason he had his records sealed. But no one said a word. His classmates from HI also know he's gay. LOL but it wasn't on CNN so...also Larry Sinclair has been speaking out about this for ages. The answer always is, OMG he's just a con man therefore...that's always the answer when information contradicts the official byline. Wrapping your head around the idea that there may actually BE a hidden agenda re blackmail and puppets can be difficult when it challenges your own bias.\n\nhttps://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2010/05/27/washington-insider-obama-member-of-chicago-gay-mans-club/\n\nObama was a puppet who bows to kiss the ring of his Saudi Overlord. His only retaliation was passive aggressive non action. 
This might help clear things up. Also, I do believe you misrepresented or your source misrepresented what the PM actually said. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BlKkd21zhI\n\nPlease note that it's 100% true that Trump needs to be more clear. However, due to the uproar over his "last night" instead of "last night on Tucker Carlson"--the search matrix for Sweden and rape/migrants and crime have millions of people around the world finding out the truth. I can live with that.\n\nOMG can you imagine what would have happened if he actually included Tucker Carlson in the sentence? There would have been some kind of nuclear insanity launched "President Trump shows bias by watching Fox instead of CNN" Can't win here yes/no?\n\nI used to wonder WTF was going on when I'd talk about my experiences in France/UK re Moslim no go zones YEARS ago. I've been called a liar so many times by ? fake UK folks? I don't know who..but dare to speak up a few years ago and you'd be hounded into oblivion.\n\n I couldn't wrap my head around it. What can the reasoning be for people telling me I didn't see what I saw or experience what I experienced and just attack me as an Islamaphobe. \n\nMy experiences in Europe is what redpilled me for Trump. I knew what I saw, I was living moving about there for about 12 years. I just can't wrap my head around why any society would do that to themselves and then lie about it. The only thing I could think of is that Londistan for example, is so full of Moslims if one person pissed them off the entire city would be blown up. It's like the ironic signs "behead those who say Islam is not peaceful". \n\nDenmark just passed a law outlawing no go zones. This is good. Very good.\n\nI was writing on rape statistics in Norway YEARS ago. They have since adapted their immigrant policies. In France it is mindboggling. Recently told someone I was sorry for shielding them from the no go zones when we were there in 2012. I truly wish I had taken this person right into it and let them see for themselves. Instead I gave this person a completely safe excursion and as a result they're like OMG you're lying (loves Hilltard). If I had not shielded this person and actually let them experience what I have, there would be no argument. Flash forward to 2017. \n\nI'm issuing the redpill of truth by making sure I send videos of places I took this person such as the Stuttgart area and the now "walled in" Eiffel Tower so they can actually see the difference. Asked the other day, "SO, you ready to go back and see the rest of Paris?" Answer.."how's Portugal these days?" LOL I'm recommending Poland and Hungary instead. It won't be long before they completely lose control of Paris like they have Marseilles and Toulouse. \n\nBack when the worst of it was confined to the South, Paris was like OMG we're so awesome and kind and multicultural. Tucker is correct, if we "fear" the rise of the neo right, then we're actually being quite stupid as the push back against this is going to be ugly. Very ugly. It need not have been.\n\nWhat's the agenda here?
Woah, talk about fake news. That's the first I've seen of any protests. From what I could tell it was a pretty big bust as far as protests go.\n\nLOL Portland man bun with BGCs getting arrested. No Police No Prisons signs....yes people going to be taking this seriously. /s
So, you're in the swamp with the gators and you have to swim without being eaten. So, you poke them in the eye and hope you live to tell about it? Trump said a compliment and got a dig in at the same time. A seemingly innocent dig...yes/no?\n\nAlways skeptical. If he was doing what every other president has done ie breaking every promise they made to get elected, I'd be really pissed. But as a life time voter, I've been plenty pissed before. Oddly I managed to carry on in my life without needing a safe space and playdoh.
I know right? It was very disconcerting, Until you see all of them in one place and read one after the other you don't realize how bad it is, or how complicit you've been by being silent and just taking it. There isn't anything they can say, they wrote them. Uncle Chang is a hero. 
Diagnosed on the Internet. YES!
LOL thanks! \n\nYou have a beer, I'll roll a fat one and together we can discover the TRUE secret behind Antarctica, and...what's flopping about in Michelle Obama's pants. \n\nThat's a mystery for the ages. I was like...nah, if she had a dick she'd strap it down (hey I have gay friends...I know the magic of double layers or duct tape) thus I found it hard to believe that if she had one she'd risk it flopping..but damn there's something flopping about in her pants in that Ellen dance video...plain as day. Now, it's probably none of my business what's in her pants, but I think I have the right to know if I should continue to call her first "lady" or not. GURL WTF is that in your pants?\n\nTony Sotomayor has a great video..he also didn't believe it\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQwR0A3-xWA\n\nUpon further reflection this explains a lot. I never doubted for a second Obama was gay, everything about him is 100% gay. His cross dressing was legendary. OK fine, well get married and have a family for politics....a lie, leaves him open to blackmail...but the man pulled off the biggest troll in the history of the United States! 
Racists take their jabs where they can.
Thank you for this reply. I'm finally getting to working on it today and this is really helpful. Thank you. 
Thank you! 
Yes. Great stories, great characters, Twists on old legends and fairy tales. I played through the game, read the series, then played through again. 
This is exactly the road I need to go down. Thank you for passing this along.  Now I've got the terms to search for to work out this solution.  Thanks!
CNN is Fox for the left.  
You've already taken the biggest hurdle and that's attacking it head on. Congratulations. When you get there you can see how people go agoraphobic (my grandma did).\n\nNow with that attitude and fearlessness, employ bio-feedback controls and you'll win. 
Now it makes sense. That Ducktales is classic. 
> I've been trying to teach her to stay still while I give other dogs treats\n\nIf you can pull that off, you'll get a Nobel Prize. 
> and crafted that album to resemble ... lysergic experiences. \n\nCan you elaborate on this further? 
And the term "Fake News" created.
Nuke the whole set from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. 
Nice work. But what happens when you turn your back? That's what we could never train her to obey.  Food overrode everything.  
Ace of Base.
Which is why we have to spread the message of: it's not a struggle between left and right.  It's a struggle between top and bottom.  \n\nIf the two major parties realized this, we be working in mostly the same direction.   
Flip 4 and 5 and that's my list exactly. \n\nIt's not that I like TH less, it's just that CH has less anxious feeling to me so I listen to it more. I love TH something fierce, though. 
Homeopathic stands alone from naturopathic or alternative medicine.  It's snake oil magic stuff based on "like cures like" and "the more you dilute something, the more potent it becomes."  Water has memory and all this other absolute nonsense.\n\nHomeopathy is to medicine what air guitar is to music.
Agreed. My wife quit cold turkey and would do fine for a while, but always go back when chips were down because of "extenuating circumstances."  \n\nThen we started on vapes a number of years back and quick cigarettes overnight.  At one point her dad died in a horrible way, but she never bought cigarettes.  She got through it without reverting.\n\nThat's huge. Vaping is amazing. \n\n
Can someone go help him board the airplane? I'm afraid that he might get within a few inches of the door and just completely miss it and run into the wall. 
Looks like you'll always triumph. 
Nice work. Dogs bark, people tell at them to shut up, but the dog interprets it as barking. \n\nTeach a dog what quiet means and you'll have a more well behaved dog. \n\nRespect isn't fear, but many think that's what it means.  
I've got nothing but R E S P E C T for the Queen of Soul.
I hate to see him go, but I love to see him play. If Stoke isn't going to play him then I hope he goes somewhere he can be utilized.\n\nI really hoped he was going to be able to pick up and take over as Crouch starts to wane. 
Used to? Still do. 
Exactly. They get turned in but no one ever prosecutes.  Might as well just do away with it and make it official.\n\nRemember, while it means that churches can now officially support candidates, other non-profits can do the same as well. \n\nLots of podcasts I listen to tip-toe around candidate supporting and now they wouldn't have to either.  For instance, the FFRF will be able to support candidates now. 
Right?  I've seen one saying it's all bullshit in two separate replies.  Not replying to other comments, I mean replying to the main story twice.\n\nIt's ridiculous. Left vs Right is keeping us in the same place we've been for a long time. 
Once you know what to look for, they become pretty obvious. I saw a lot of the same behavior during the initial CTR push during the primaries. \n\nI just tag the names for reference later and just move on.
No, the aliens gave that to us.  
 I didn't know they stacked shit that high.
(Think!)
Lunar eclipses only occur on full moons. So all we have here is a lunar eclipse and a comet. Not unheard of. \n\n

I know where you're at. I would have them at movie theaters and barbershops because I was 'trapped.'  Know that your adrenaline is going to release but that it can't hurt you.\n\nIt sounds weird, but you need to use bio-feedback to control it.  The biggest things for me are:\n\n1: Slow breathing. Breathe ALL the way in. Maximum capacity.  Then let it out. Let ALL of it out. Then all the way back in.  Minimum of 5 seconds to fully inhale or exhale.  You need to get high on oxygen. That tells your adrenaline gland to shut off.  Fast breathing = panicking (im being chased by a lion). Slow breathing = At rest.   You'll get a head rush from the oxygen, that's fine, that will help and let you know it's working. \n\n2: Smile. Doesn't have to be a big stupid Joker grin, but smile.  Biofeedback says: "He's not grimacing/frowning. Things must be ok.  Fake it. Fake that you're happy. Smile and look at silly cat pictures or something.\n\n3: Keep your shoulders down. Shoulders down = relaxed. Shoulders up = defensive.\n\n4: chew gum. This keeps you from clenching your jaw, again indicating stress via bio-feedback. Chew it and sloooooooow breathe.\n\nWrite these down and take them with you if it'll help.\n\nIt's just adrenaline. Breathe fully-in/fully-out. Smile. Keep shoulders down. Chew gum.\n\nYou can beat it. It can be done. It gets easier.\n\nSomeday you'll be doing something and start to feel one come on and laugh to yourself and go: "Really? we're doing that?" and it'll fade and it'll be the best day of your life.

Can they? Is anyone doing anything like that? I know there are field test things like DUI stops, but is there  actual measurable data?
I personally don't look to drugs as a cure for anxiety. I did for a while and then I realized that it doesn't fix, it just helps you to get through bad times.  \n\nI see any meds (CBD or otherwise) as a crutch until I can go through some 'mental rehabilitation.'\n\nAnxiety will always be there until you confront it head on.  I still have twinges now but I've learned how to take its power away and get it to recede for me.\n\n\nAnxiety is just adrenaline. It's your natural fight-or-flight response going into a feedback look. "I'm nervous, release adrenaline, oh look adrenaline that's scary, release more adrenaline."  You don't catch anxiety and it doesn't happen to you.  It is you.  You can control it. You just have to learn to recognize the adrenaline releases, breathe and smile through them, and you'll come out on top.
So here's the problem.  They test you, you come up positive for using a few days ago, and as far as everyone is concerned you are high at work.  \n\nHow does this get resolved? How can they determine when or if someone is high vs having thc in their system? 
What's frustrating is even if it did get you high (which it doesn't) how is that any worse that dozens of seizures a day?\n\nIf he's not having seizures but is high, who cares? How is that not a better state to be in? 
They've lied long enough that it became a truth to anyone who listens to them. 
Many of the dumps here in CA are covered now
The problem is that being Schedule 1 you can be fired from a job that has federal contracts under the Drug Free Workplace act, even if you work in a state where it's legal.\n\nHR departments don't care about nuances, only keeping the government contracts happy and thus firing any 'drug users' that they find in testing.  \n\nIt used to be that only THC would get you, now it sounds like CBD could do the same. I don't know if drug tests even bother testing for CBD, but it's possible they may start to. 
Feel free.  I heard it from someone else too. It really sums it up perfectly.  
:)  Welcome to your new life.  I'm so glad to hear this is working for you.  I've been there and gone through it, it does get easier and CBD will help.  Congratulations. 
Yep. Exactly.\n\nAnd since most people apparently don't have the memory retention or time to study this they fall into "us and them" because it's far easier to work with.
Exactly. It's like vaping instead of smoking. There is no evidence of significant damage to lungs vs known carcenogenics with smoking. So vape instead.  I'll take some potentially minor damage to my lungs than cancer.  
I couldn't get the hang of it after hours and hours of playing.  I even did grinding to try and get better and power up, but it made no difference.  
True. But the problem is how do you test for being high now vs last Friday? That's the problem with the tests.  We don't have a way of demonstrating that someone is high and unsafe at work vs someone who takes low THC/high CBD for medication.
Yep, but that takes more patience, time, and training.  Lazy dog owners find it easier just to hit/kick/punish. \n\n
There wasn't pg-13 when it was released. 
Bingo. The DFWA demands that they have to ensure a drug free work place.  Medical doesn't matter on federal scale.  I've been getting by with CBD and it works amazingly well with zero head high.  At this point, I don't even care any more because living a normal life pain free is more important to me.  
Agreed.  I was able to quit and leave it be. But my wife started smoking much younger (parents both smoked) so she would pick it up again which meant I did as well. No, I can't just say no when she goes outside, that was too much. Like an alcoholic being a bartender.  It is all in your head, but some people can't break out of that. 
They do. I had a friend get nailed because he came up positive for alcohol.  He used mouthwash that morning.  They said it happens a lot and to come back. He got the job, but they do check for alcohol.  
Indeed. Free Cascadia.  
Yeah? And what about people using it for medical purposes? Should they just adult harder and suck up the pain for however long it takes to find a job? 
Which is cheating. It's like blowing yourself up and claiming you're a martyr.  No, sorry, it doesn't work that way. 
Land of the free*. 
Find evidence of lung damage and present the results.  Until then, it's a far better option than cancer.

> t's still not a reason to dismiss Russia's involvement though\n\nOutright dismiss? No. Take with a massive grain of salt? Yes.\n\nDuring the election Hillary/DNC/etc were tossing around the Russian thing virtually from out of nowhere. No official reports or evidence and was a total smoke-screen to the content of the email.\n\nNow that they're battling from within they're trying to do the same thing again in order to show a "pattern of working with Russia" when the only pattern is tossing BS at the wall and seeing what sticks.\n\n
And you were right. 
I've got some nudes she sent me. I'll post them for you.

Parking enforcement officers are basically squeezing money out of their fellow citizens to feed a corrupt system so I think it's perfectly fine to bamboozle them.  I'd def. say that one's a win.

Here, that doesn't really do much. The city administration is deeply corrupt. So corrupt that it spawns FBI investigations.
How would you even get away with that?  I've never met a pizza shop that'll let me pay less than they're asking. He must spend a lot of his time on the phone with various customer service lines.

Is Discord paying people to recruit?  I've seen one unasked-for Discord server after another promoted here on reddit, for a curiously wide range of topics.
Have you ever done any audience interaction before, ever done any hosting?  Have you done much interviewing?  Basically, what's your experience level, here?
If you're in town, there's no real good reason to take an intensive.  It's faster, yes, but you reduce every other benefit of taking classes.  Not a great trade-off.
Firing someone for that is some inhumane bullshit.  
If you want to open your own theater, it stands to reason that you should go get some experience working in a top-tier theater. Chicago's a good place to do that.
You've merely been lucky.  Most startups are very small, and knife their people on the reg.  I'm at a very small company right now.  Several of the most loyal, longest-time employees were let go without warning to "cut costs" recently. 
Listen here, old man. You know *nothing* about how much I do or don't work or get cast.  You don't know who I am.  You don't have a single clue how long I've been in improv.   I just don't think Mike fucking Myers will do a good job.  Leave me alone. Go bother someone else with your condescending horseshit—or, better yet?  Keep it to yourself.
Is this just pulled out of your ass-based fantasy land?  There are fewer FT employees than ever before.  Legal wars are being waged to prevent employees from even being *called employees.*
It sounds like you guys didn't handle it super well, but, also, a coach shouldn't try to be a director.  It sounds like she overstepped her bounds a bit.  But what are you going to "fix?"  Are you going go try to talk her into un-quitting?  Let her go.
 Why be in the subreddit, then?
Yeah they had to Encarta it
I can't imagine ever wasting my time taking a commercial acting workshop.

Dude.  That was the non-proportional tourist map of antiquity.  And you're thinking of the *lighthouse of Alexandria.* The library wasn't on the list.

> No boss is ever going to consider it a favor when their employees are doing a good job.\n\nI know.  They're sick too. \n\n>Paying a salary for a job is not exploitation, especially when the conditions are agreed upon. \n\nUsing someone else's labor to enrich yourself is always exploitation, regardless of the conditions.
Trick them into playing Harolds
There's absolutely no reason to be fair to greedy corporations.  Their first duty should be to their workers.  They choose to let it be to the shareholders.
Oh I'm looking at specific unions in specific industries that are pretty dope
I have to say, I'm a little uncomfortable with how much money she gave to the people who voted for her.  Seems like DT might be "kissing a goblin" here.
The BBB's a private company.  It's 100% a racket.  
All right, well, you've got the skills to pick out the right people, probably.  You just might not recognize them.  As for interviewing, the crucial thing is to err on the side of diving into things.  If they toss out something interesting & keep going, take their metaphorical hand and get back to that interesting thing.  Just like you would in an improv scene. 
Anything's better than crawling
Cities use parking tickets as a revenue stream. That's completely wrong, and an abuse of the citizenry.
The goal was just that it was interesting for someone like Rogan to weigh in
Yeah and they have to be verified when you register, and you're risking deportation & worse when you do. What do you think happens when you try to register to vote with a stolen SSN? They don't wink and hand you a fucking Democratic ballot

> Of those, 3.1 million live in states with ID requirements to vote (AZ/GA/KA/KS/IN/MS/ND/OH/TN/TX/WI), which leaves 8.0 million possible unauthorized adult voters.\n\nYou still have to register, man.   In CA, for example, that requires a DL or ID, and an SSN.
Fuck that, and fuck his boss. He's doing his boss a million favors daily. The boss should offer to suck his dick every morning.
Who said ban?
Why are they uncomfortable?
> The employees that were fired probably really pitched in and did their best out of loyalty to their employer.\n\nWhich is, of course, fucking stupid.  Company loyalty gets you a knife in the back. Every time.
That's because your butt has been hurt.   I don't trust him to do this part well.  I think it's going to be shitty.

Sorry, I'm a bit confused.  How are you meaning "jam" here?
He's openly a notorious perfectionist. He's talked about how he's gotten a rep for being difficult, which he feels is unfair, because he frequently refuses to take notes or compromise, because he rightly or wrongly believes he knows comedy best. I don't buy blaming it on the studio. The hacky lowbrow midget jokes, broad accents, etc. are certainly in his wheelhouse.
I wish you continued luck in finding such good places to work
Here's what I think: Never read the comments
*Thank* you.
good fucking gravy sorry he didn't have a thinkpiece ready for you
Is he supposed to be unfunny & dramatic in this role?  Why is it hurting you personally that I don't think Mike Myers will do a good job, based on him doing an awful job in comedy in the past 10 years?
I don't think I've ever heard a story, after the 1970s, where someone who wasn't already a millionaire was well-served by company loyalty all the way to the end.
Spelling is just another form of statist oppression
Not as many as the corrupt people get.  This last one was a resounding defeat for anyone wanting to change things up.

After the fucking *Love Guru* we shouldn't trust him with comedy anymore. I have a feeling he's gonna turn out some dog shit here.

What if you keep your car in the same spot on an empty street for too long?  What if there's a slight grade to the road and they decide your wheels aren't curbed enough?

The visual quality drop is so jarring!  Filming improv is *really hard* but I think you'd be better served by having a fuller range of angles available.  It's a little weird that it never comes from SR.  But the wrappers look & sound really great.  Cool project. 
The BBB doesn't really mean shit. I laugh every time a customer threatens us by saying they're going to report us to them.  We're not a member.
I mean, there *is* significant anti-Trump sentiment, from a lot of people who frequent the Internet.  Many of them didn't pay sufficient attention before the election, and are freaking out now.  He's dominating the public consciousness, in a generally negative way, so why wouldn't that be reflected here?  As well, Trump supporters often prefer to stay in pro-Trump areas.  That's where all the pro-Trump news is.
Shit man, even if you *are* helping them with that, all it takes is for someone in management to decide they don't like you, and you're the new fucko numero uno.
Got it.  In the US, an improv jam is like an improv open mic. 
You've got a backwards view on labor.  The rich aren't doing their workers a favor by exploiting them.  The workers are doing the rich the favor of allowing use of their labor.  Being a quiet worker who takes abuse is going even above & beyond that favor.

You know what you want to do. Don't force strangers to make the call for you.
You don't really get to see a judge, unless you want to spend months & money getting there.\n\nIt's overseen by a private corporation with their own appeals process.  First, you get to mail in a form saying that you contest the violation.  Then, approx. 60 days later, you get a response, which is most often "Nah."\n\nThen, if you want, you can schedule an administrative hearing, which takes more weeks.  This is *not* from a judge.  And you have to pay, in full, before they'll let you do that.  And it's you don't necessarily get an in-person hearing, either. \n\nThen, if *that* fails, you can take it to the court with an actual judge. You have to pay up more first.\n\nIt's a racket that also enforces some good rules but is explicitly a revenue stream for the city.  Most people who aren't rich do not have the time or money to contest unjust tickets.  So they just pay up.

Sounds like you are on the right path man. Sounds like she's pretty serious, too. Introduced to the parents? Unless they showed up unannounced, that means she is showing you off to see if they approve. She's ready to lock it down.

It's probably that this is really just common knowledge. Everyone knows that propaganda is distributed via AI. What I found interesting was the level of detail this went into with regard to that AI, the companies behind it, and attribution to active politicians.
> Possibly souring the relationship between Malaysia and North Korea? Thus driving them even further into the Chinese basket, even though China isn't greatly pleased, either?\n\nThis exactly. Backs them into a corner. We've exhausted our avenues for sanctions, for the most part. Any further sanctions would just embolden support for jong un in his country. There is, also a 3rd option I've heard no talk of. What if it was a "Lone Wolf"? Someone simply recognized a member of the Kim family, maybe an escaped north korean, and decided to get revenge.
Cocktails is people showing off their creation. homebartending, when you exclude spam posts of peoples for profit blogs, here is what you find:\n\n* Questions for any home bartenders!\n* Bartending License Requirements for American States.\n* Science tells us how to prevent and 'even' cure the dreaded hangover.

Corruption?! Mind. Blown. That is fucking genius. Also makes casters squishy for a reason.
> Yes you've presented no evidence of that.\n\nWe have presented precedent for investigation, however. I'm sure a full financial review would provide the evidence necessary to prove or disprove the allegations. There will be no investigation though. If there were, trump would already have announced it. Hillary and the CF are above reproach, in that even when out of the whitehouse, they have enough pull to prevent inquiry. Do you think Trump lost interest after becoming president? No.\n\n>you can't just post a lie, without even a little evidence, and expect it to be swallowed.\n\nBut we do have evidence of an exclusive dinner, as well as evidence of media collusion with the hillary campaign. What you are doing is demanding an unreasonable amount of evidence while discrediting out of hand any evidence presented. Thus, you are an implacable skeptic. Skepticism is healthy. Your skepticism seems to be so intertwined with your own belief system that it has blinded you to any criticism of Hillary.\n\n>Dear lord, someone is still obsessed with Clinton.\n\nThis derisive statement belies your ignorance of recent occurrences in this sub. We have experienced attributable targeted attacks by "Correct The Record" agents as well as AI bots. We have seen media smear campaigns in the form of "Fake News" allegations. These are both easily attributable to discussion of the Podesta Leaks. Millions of dollars were spent to discredit this sub by the Clinton campaign.\n\n**So forgive us if we have not forgotten.**
Flora/Fauna and geography also match. Tropical/Desert, larg body of water to the east, with a river to the south, But if it's where I'm thinking it is, aghrapur itself is missing. Very well could be anywhere on the western shore, however. The river itself could be any river or even just runoff.

> two women involved in the actual poisoning.\n\nHence the quotes. The term does not mean only one person can participate, only that there was no organization supporting the action. It's the sloppiness that makes me think it's not NKIntel or Kim. Being done in an airport, where there will definitely be footage recorded of the attack, means either they wanted to be caught, or they're just fucking stupid. Extrajudicial murder in a foreign country, especially one of the few countries remotely friendly with you, is not something you want to be caught doing. Could be considered an act of war.
You might also want to investigate their financial ties and whether they benefit financially from this agreement.

A few points:\n\n* Not everyone is a racist biggot in america. Those who are not racists are just quieter. It's not even the majority of people in america, It's a fraction. Most americans aren't even white.\n\n* Don't blame the people for politicians wanton moneygrubbing bloodlust. Instead, blame us for being uninformed and lazy.\n\n* don't blame us for being uninformed. Blame the politicians for monopolizing news media.\n\n* Don't blame us for being lazy. Most americans don't even realize there's a problem.\n\n* America didn't elect Trump. Hillary and the DNC elected trump.

Please note, all of this advice will vary, depending on which servers you are against. There are a few servers which are populated heavily by oceanic countries, aussies, kiwis, etc. They will flood WvW between 2am and 7am. If you are running into zergs in the early hours, you are probably up against one of these servers.\n\nAlso, catching 1v1s in wvw is always going to be difficult. Try camping the supply depot closest to the enemy spawn. Don't capture it, though. Often times a player will swing by to fill their supply before trying to catch up to their squad. Beyond that, expect at minimum to run into 3 enemies at once, up to 5. if you do encounter an enemy running solo, unless they are a gank class like theif, don't expect them to fight you. They will usually run away.\n\nIf you can find just 1 person to join you, you'll likely have a better time of it. 1v3 is tough, 2v5 is a little more forgiving.
Here's the thing. You can reset, but never prevent. Just like in real life, if you create a new identity, the information on your old identity remains. Eventually, with enough data points, your activity is going to be attributable to the original identity.\n\nBasically, total invisibility is impossible. Even if you only ever use tor via qubes/whonix, your actions are recorded. The key is separation. So for facebook, you want to sandbox that off from everything else you do. Don't share things to facebook that you look at on other websites. Don't click links to webpages in facebook, etc. Your email, connect to with a different sandbox. Browse reddit on a 3rd sandbox. You can even sandbox your /r/conspiracy activity by itself. \n\nBeyond sandboxing, there's also data contamination. Rather than having a very short list of specific things you are interested based on where you go and what you click, instead, soil that data by going everywhere and clicking everything. Also, generating false web activity while online will soil your timezone attribution. Look into AdNauseum. Not only does this falsify your targeted advertisement, it also costs the ad companies money.\n\nFinally, you need to identify all vectors of possible attack. Put a radio in your closet tuned to the local hispanic channel. Place your smart phone next to it at night. Then, keep an eye out for any spanish language ads. Smart TV? Same thing. Anything that might have a mic.\n\nAnother idea, if you're pretty computer savvy. Set up your own email server on a domain you own. Create a different email for every piece of paper you put your email address on. This will show you who is selling your info.\n\nDon't sign up for loyalty cards. Most clerks will have a spare card.\n\nThese are just a few tips. You're stepping into a whole new realm and it's not a conspiracy. They really are out to get you.
One should be critical of anyone trying to disqualify investigation into any subject on this sub. All out of hand disqualification is suspect of being propoganda in my eyes.
He doesn't even get any points for that. True hero right there.
Pizzagate is still getting coverage. It's not headline news, but it does come up on talking heads shows and is what the media is talking about every time it mentions #FakeNews. Pizzagate gave credence to the term and popularized it. Kind of like how 'Denigration' popped up overnight as a term to describe any negative statement about anything.\n\nHere's the thing: Much of the following pizzagate has gathered has been due to, understandably, media backlash and suppression. Media and politicians already know that outright coverups and overt censorship draws negative attention to a subject. That's why they didn't do this with Occupy wallstreet. It's why they didn't do this with the NSA leaks. It's why we still hear the occasional mention of BLM. Why WOULD they overtly cover up and publicly attempt to discredit pedophilia allegations unless they WANTED more attention drawn to it? If they didn't want people to care about pizza gate, they would just report briefly on it for a couple days, taking no side, then forget about it. Eventually it would go away like anything else.
2 factor authentication. You may have heard of it before.
Looks like that door is bugged, causing your client to crash. Fix the door.
Beyond the fractals, you also have access to several new zones on the west side of the map, beginning with silverwastes. There are many events going on constantly, and a unique participation/reward system. As you complete missions, you will get chests that contain keys. You can use these keys after the meta event map boss is defeated to open bandit chests. There are also shovels which can be used to locate these chests on the map at any time. I make about 10 gold per cycle. It's a good gold farm. If you like the vanilla classes, and don't plan on raiding, I think you could easily dump a couple hundred hours into the game.
Turn yoru graphics way down. It's visible at long range while regular stone is not.
yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's the location. My wife was talking and I was in combat while the audio was playing without subtitles. Could have easily been speaking of some other event in Aghrapur. 
EO on monday restricting travel from 7 arab nations.\n\n>unapproved statements\n\nThat's not how government agencies work. The epa is tasked with collecting data and reporting on it. They don't run their reporting past the president, it is provided to the president, and to congress, and the public. It's part of their job.
Protecting your investment.
I'll say it could be either. Jun Nam is in exile yes. He also was last seen publicly over a decade ago. While Jong-un is not the most stable person, what does he gain by killing his estranged, exiled, illigitimate brother in a public place in a foreign country? More likely a CIA op to increase tensions between NC and other countries. Doubt it will lead to war with US.
So, in other words, the uranium mined in the US is leaving our borders and ending up in Russia. And we can't suspend the export of uranium? The state department couldn't NOT sign off on the deal? Sounds more like you're making excuses for them.
I, too, live in AZ right now, but I'm from arkansas. Moderately relevant!
Then Devs upgrade iron to also damage t3 walls.
So... how did it go....?\n
How about separate posts for trump? They're both corrupt. Both worth investigating. Lets not derail this conversation. It would be a disservice. Trump investigations deserve their own thread.
I'm not surprised by the manipulation. I expect that. It's the attribution to the specific campaign that is interesting.
You can be arrested for molesting a cheeseburger in New Orleans.
Plain text java script in an executable is not going to run. This was likely pasted into a text editor and the extension changed to .exe. This would explain why you cannot get it to run.
Hard to get past the trump+pedo spam these days, even with OC and evidence.
Sure, but we have the ability to control to whom we export, and if we find that a company in a friendly country is exporting to enemies of our state, we can most certainly break off any dealings we have with that company.
Obviously you've never played ark on an  official server and had to deal with alpha tribes.
You should be using greased or burst sounds in banshee anyway.
Propaganda to discredit the leaks.
Priorities.
There are certain areas in the game that reduce your stats until you have a performer heal you. Apparently you charge yourself up in these locations.
> I'm sure someone benefited somewhere but it seems like a pretty innocuous deal\n\nIn other words, you don't think an investigation of financial ties to politicians who signed the deal is warranted, even in light of the fact that russians are receiving the mined uranium? Do you also not think Trump and Team, et al, warrants an investigation with regard to russia and financial ties therein?
Game balance and experience is generally handled by a different department than system compatability and optimization.
That's not a blog, that's propoganda.
Mortar recipe?
This deserves it's own thread. The sub should also compile a list of known agent provocateurs. Not the ctr shills who post here, but ones operating publicly and are provable/attributable to know propaganda campaigns.
Let's throw Hillary under that bus too.
There are still hundreds of places in america where it's illegal to sell alcohol.
Seconded. If you can catch out to quartzite, then catch out of quartzite, you should be good. If you're in phoenix proper, you may have trouble, though. Also, don't get stranded half way between. There ain't shit out there.\n\nAfter quartzite, there's also a squatter's refuge/artist commune at the Salton Sea called slab city. Worth dropping in.
What examples can you give us of Magic you have planned? Will it be mana based?
For meta and silverwaste farming, aoe and mobility are key. For that, short bow on theif and staff ele are best for me. However, if you are doing gathering, you will want as many characters as you can map clear nodes on. To be most efficient in farming nodes, you will want 6 max level theifs.
This right here. These sandstone huts, they're the equivalent to thatch houses. Take a steel pick to a thatch house in ark. See how long it lasts.
> Uranium One can't export any of the uranium that they mine because they don't have an export license\n\nSo all the uranium is still in the United States then?
Link to the projector specs? Powered by USB power supply? What was the video input?
got a screenshot?
Yeah, here in America, not everyone can afford a server switch. 40% of persons live below poverty level. If something happens, like an epileptic seizure, and a concerned person calls you an ambulance, you could owe 10k+$ in medical bills, even if no treatment is provided and you never set foot in the ambulance. Persons with epilepsy literally wear dog tags that say "Do Not Call Ambulance", because they could be financially bankrupted. Federal minimum wage is roughly 7 euros. Because of "Obamacare", in order to not have to provide health insurance to employees, most companies will not allow you to have more than 28 hours per week. This includes almost every restaurant, convenience store, businesses with more than 30 and less than 200 employees, essentially most employment not a trade craft or requiring college. (Don't even get me started on college debt.)\n\ntl;dr: please, i can has socialism?
So we should just forget about clinton and her crimes? Why can't we be critical of both clinton and trump? Stop trying to derail this investigation in support of your own.
North. Just go north. Did you look to the north?
Runs fine for me. Do you meet the min specs? I'm running complete plebe hardware and having no problems.
Power is asexual. That being said, Hillary did a shitty job.
>Now, Im not laying all the blame on my teamates. Im pretty sure I have to take some of the blame as well, which is why Im here.\n\nDon't buy into this bullshit. Elo hell is real. If you lose by exactly 100 points, and you can admit that everyone on your team out performed you, THEN you can say that you have to take the blame. Until then, it sounds like everyone you're teamed with is shit and you probably deserve a higher rank.
Total wine had plastic spouts that twist closed. Seem accurate. I don't know how heavily this particular shelf will be used.
Denno coil, Ghost in the shell, Armitage 3rd in that order. Any real life movies follow those two.
Can confirm. I bought a character slot specifically for the space to cash efficiency. I have bought zero bank slots.
I would just like to add, it also depends on clientele. I frequented the bar at a Peabody/Excelsior. The majority of the clients ordered classics. Martini's, Manhattans, old fashoneds, etc. But it was attached to the convention center, so events would drastically change the dominant drink class and business would triple without warning. I stopped going on friday/saturday nights. Adaptability and range are two experience points a hotel bar could add to your resume.
There are certain areas in the game that reduce your stats until you have a performer heal you. Apparently you charge yourself up in these locations.
I get that, but the implementation is awesome.
Hold to power attack does the same damage as a regular attack. Likely more for pvp to attack blocking players.
It also probably has to do with thralls/resource balancing.
Plushy Griffin!
You don't lose your level.
True, but you're going to need to be out of the newb river before you make the metal pick. You need 240 iron stone to make a metal pick. By the time you've collected that and built everything required to make it, you should be able to build the t2 walls. Hell, by the time you've collected enough materials and forged them down to build anything of significance out of t2, you'll have t2 walls. That way, you can buy the bluep, and build all your structures immediately.
Not the countries, the people. I swear you Trumptards are as bad as the Demnazis. I'm not going to ELI5 shit for you til you come up with some kind of flimsy counterpoint. This partisan zealotry is destroying this nation.
Theif and Ele both have viable vanilla builds. Necro not so much.
> Aren't receiving the mined uranium. No exporting allowed without a license.\n\nYet you just said: \n\n>mcvey 1 point 2 hours ago \n>Every country that mines uranium exports it.\n\nAnd then:\n\n>I believe an investigation into those ties are already under way and I do support it.\n\nIn other words, you support an investigation into trump for ties to russia, yet any investigation into clinton and ties to russia are "Trumped Up" and baseless
Appreciate the input, I'm 30 lol. Just want to see other people's experiences. Haven't touched them in years at this point. 
That's interesting. So they are mining the uranium, exporting to Canada, enriching it, and importing it back to the united states and..... what?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0\n\nYet we have evidence that this may have been quid pro quo laundered through the Clinton Foundation.\n\nI'm just saying, we have a russian owned canadian company mining uranium on US soil and payed money to the clinton foundation at the time the authorization was given by the NRC. That throws a red flag for me. That should throw a red flag for you too.
Yes, Trump has all those powers, and is now also silencing the EPA, extrajudiciously enabling energy companies to threaten indian nations sovereignty, and systematically disenfranchising some of the most repressed people in the world.
I don't think it works that way any more. Yes, there were paid actors who targeted this reddit specifically during the wikileaks clinton drops. Most of the people you see now are actual people. Angry democrats who can't find anyone to blame. CTR has been disbanded. Soros doesn't operate on the micro level. He's funding entire movements. What you are dealing with now are zealots.
With regard to the pedo issue, I believe it is a red herring to distract from more substantial, prosecutable allegations. The fact that Jones, who is considered to be an agent provocateur by many in the community, has been spouting this story for almost a decade only lends credence to that belief. Personally, I see the Pedo/Fake News as an organized effort to discredit this sub and other outlets. Not that I think it should not be investigated and pursued. I just think it's a dead end.
Disagree. It's about half the size of ark standard map, if not a quarter. Takes me about 15 minutes to walk half way across the map.\n\nDon't let that hold you back though. Map quality in this game is significantly better than the island. I'd say a 40 slot server would be pretty cozy. 70 slots is probably overkill. Terrain is much more vertical. There's a lot of terrain that's not navigable as well. You can't simply walk straight across the map. Lots of canyon trails, rivers have waterfalls, permanent npc structures, etc. It's big enough that without having your marker appear on the map, you could easily get lost, but small enough that if you were in the center of the map, you could reasonably reach any other part of the map on foot without making a day of it.
I want a Trump bobble head that has a slap interaction so I can smack the shit out of him at random and he will say "Look at these hands. They're normal sized hands."
I spend more time sorting inventory after octovine than I spend beating octovine.

1. I hope everyone that hates on the show at least reads the comics, they are amazing. \n2. I got such a kick out of the group of apathetic skinny trash people, slunking around with clubs. They are nothing but some extra bodies to drop on the battlefield for the upcoming war. \n3. How did they forget how to use English in the few years since all the world went to shit? Go, up up up, look, fly. Assholes. \n4. I believe they should get to the war sometime by mid next season at this rate. \nI agree with you that the show is tough to get through, but I'm hoping once the war starts, it will be fun for at least a few episodes.
My most memorable was from  6 years ago, 4th of July, friend came over and brought a quad of mushrooms. (Huge bastards, was told they were grown on coconut pads or some shit, which is why they were enormous) It was late in the day and I remember not being in the mood to trip, but was convinced to give it a go, because, "it's the 4th you pussy let's party"\nTook just over an eight of the mushrooms, tripped my brains out for a good three hours, was having the time of my life. Auras around everyone, melting ground/trees, walls breathing, all the good stuff.\n But then I got cocky and fucked up. It was a clean trip up until this point, just water and gum, (part of my Trippin balls Boy Scout pack). I decided to smoke a cigarette (I don't smoke) and chug a beer with a friend (terrible idea) \nMy party came crashing to an immediate halt. After smoking and chugging, my world immediately started spinning, fast. I ran out of the house, and started spray vomming all over the yard. I remember vividly thinking I couldn't breathe due to me constantly puking. The mental side of that started to fuck with me, I was peaking, and feeling like I was about to die. I remember the exact thought that went through my dumb head, this is how people feel right before they die. I had lots of regrets, was totally freaked out, and didn't go out to see any fireworks, cuz I wanted to stay in my nice safe bed that night. Great start to the trip, but crashed and burned mid flight. 
I want to try something new, \nIt's in a dark place out of view.\nShe always says no, and \nRedirects with a blow, \nBut I want to try something new. \n\nI want to try something new\nI think I know just what to do,\nI'll make a strong drink \nAnd give her a wink, \nAnd maybe I'll get into her stink. \n\nI want to do something new, \nIf I approach with some class,\nBe nice with no sass,\nShe might just let me into that ass. \n\n

This is true, except for military, which was his primary goal. When digging into why the military, he explained he wanted to get out and see the world. I am currently trying to think outside of the box to see what careers might allow him to still travel. I think it comes down to this student wanting very badly to remove himself from the very difficult environment that he lives within on a daily basis.

I probably need to reiterate that I am an educator, and not familiar with SSBI or TS clearance. I'd find it difficult to believe that felony charges such as his would not be cared about. From my research I have found, drug charges are a hard line no in the military, same with weapon charges. 
Sound system? 
Can I also add in Conky's bad fur day?
I have many students that will be looking into this, however with military nothing is considered "sealed" or expunged, which is unfortunate for young students who get caught up in gangs when they are kids and come around when they are older.

I've watched every episode seasons 1-7 probably 7 times a piece (easily...) Season 8... a few times, but can't go near 9/10. The writing is awful. Am I missing something? I watched the seasons once through when they first aired and can't go back. Any favorite episodes in those seasons you would recommend me trying once more? I've tried but normally only get a few minutes in and get pissed off/turn it off.

I work with high school students that have labels of emotional or behavioral disabilities. One student in particular has had the dream to become a marine, however today he was heartbroken to find out that his prior felonies will deem him ineligible to enlist. (Grew up inner city Chicago, gang involvement, drug charges, weapon charge). These were from when he was 12-15. He is lost as to which avenues he should pursue, he wants to see the world, wants to learn new things, become disciplined. Thanks for any help.

This was super satisfying to watch, and got me out of doing work for ten minutes, so thanks for posting! 
Why thanks for asking. Both started their journeys as semi successful members of society. Cricket was a priest, clean shaved, compassionate guy. Sam was a veterinarian who owned his own practice. Then, both of their lives took a shit. They both lost their professions, Cricket turned into a dog orgy burn victim, and Sam turned into a hot dog eating cave man who you could smell from a good distance away. Both were directly influenced by the main characters from each show. 
William Henry Harrison lasted 32 days. This is Donald Trump's 18th day in office.
And in a few months it will make 3 million at the box office and be gone forever. A24 does a good job building up an internet circle jerk over their films but they do a horrible job reaching people who actually pay for movies.
To me I felt like multiple times we had the same information established twice regarding Lee's past, his relationship with his brother, etc. I think it would've been better if they had started in the present, flashbacked after Lee found out he was now Patrick's guardian, and then stayed in the present for the remainder of the film. \n\nI think when you have a movie that is so much about human relationships that it's a bit sluggish to constantly be cutting to scenes from the past that really don't add anything to the whole. I wanted very much to see/experience the trajectory of Lee & Patrick trying to make due with each other given their current circumstances. The films structure, in part, denied me this.
They really aren't. For example made for TV movies would be posted under r/television. Perhaps Netflix movies articles should remain in r/Netflix where they belong.
I'm not a fan of A24. I was disappointed by and flat out hated some of their 2016 releases.
Never watched a single episode. Too much member berry shit.
I would like propose a separate sub for articles about Netflix movies. 
I weep for the future.
It didn't work for me as psychological horror. I honestly just thought it was a very cold, very vapid mess. They also shouldn't have called it The Witch. They should've called it The Evil Goat, but I have a feeling that wouldn't have sold as many tickets.
Best show on TV.
I think people THINK they're better because they're not watching the shows on HBO, Showtime, FX, AMC, and even some Network channel shows.
I weep constantly.
I feel like there's a connection to Jesus, but it's hard for me to put in words what I think the ending signifies beyond that.
Sure, but Robertson wouldn't have been the first in that regard. He was a good actor, particularly in a film from 1964 called The Best Man. I would've chosen O'toole in 68.
This is why I don't watch The Americans. Real spy stories from history are far more interesting.
https://youtu.be/YOaYkT6fsXg
Idea: They should stop production on these films and make anything else. Literally anything else.
I feel that neither the MSM nor Trump can/should be trusted blindly.
I honestly doubt it. La La Land will likely win Director, Picture, Actress, and a bunch of techs. Jenkins will have to live with a screenplay Oscar and supporting actor for Ali. 
Yes in order to solve the problem of bias/inaccurate news let's put our fates in the hands of that extremely fair/neutral and in no way totally corrupt Mark Zuckerberg. Erica Albright will be purged from the internet if it's the last thing he does!
This was the worst movie of last year. Great movie to watch on Valentines if you hate the person your with.
If he clarified his statement to say he was speaking about 17 year olds (which is above age of consent in the UK) then what is so controversial about what he's saying? I don't agree with him at all, but isn't this exactly what Maher was talking about when he referred to "liberals taking the bait"?
Too bad the movie was a dull piece of austere intellectual masturbation.
Well shit I'm really screwing up then cause I'm not earning any £
The show was created by a former CIA officer who has written some of the episodes. He's never directed any of them. \n\nI realize some like The Americans, but for me it always came off as rather phony (despite its creators background) and far less interesting than the history it's sprung from.
Yeah I was just picturing all that sweet syrupy filo dough all over his face. Now that's a mask people wouldn't forget.
But it does mean that they will win and the others will lose.

Wow, I can't imagine many would agree with you there.
How long do we count before throwing it?
At least it will be a great film about itself.
Movies are officially dead. I blame Netflix.
Remakes aren't necessarily bad or lazy. It has never been easier to seek out/watch films and there's no reason why people shouldn't be encouraged to watch both.
Movies are very clearly dead. Straight to video netflix productions are not movies. \n\nDon't believe me? Read it from Scorsese himself-\nhttps://qz.com/878002/the-movies-are-dead-according-to-martin-scorsese-and-ridley-scott/
Stick around. It'll only get better from here.\n\nHonestly I think people need to not be so uptight when others share their opinion that goes to counter to their own. It seems so childish and insecure to me.
Whatever will we do without all the posts in popular actors pages that have the subject line "Gay?"
I'm not planning on watching it despite being a huge Scorsese fan. I think it's perfectly sane to be upset at the state of movies today and how Netflix has made the situation worse.
My personal opinion is that he should have won for Lion in Winter. Cliff Robertson was a great actor too and gave a good performance in Charly, but how Oscar voters chose him over O'toole I'll never know. It's especially crazy when you consider how many great performances O'toole had already given up to that point (Lawrence of Arabia, Becket, Lord Jim). 
Moonlight was disappointing. Talked to many who feel the same way but are afraid to say so publicly.\n\nThe Witch, The Lobster, 20th Century Women, Green Room and especially Swiss Army Man were all terrible films that I severely regretted having watched. \n\nThey're going for the extreme art house crowd and in my opinion they're allowing the opinions of internet bloggers/film twitter universe to cloud their judgement. They need to focus on catering to people who actually pay to see movies and what they have to say about their films. Box office receipts for their titles are clearly telling a different story than reviews are.
Fuck Netflix for destroying movies as we know them.
Yes, yes it is.
Netflix movies are not movies.
Winner.
I'm neutral on politics, but everyone should see this film as it is a very underrated adaptation of Orwell's work.
An often repeated quote to me is that 9 times out of 10 when a note is given the suggestion of what to do is not one you should take but that 9 times out of 10 when a note is given that they are correct that you have a problem.
>"Both men were wearing heavy tactical vests, and the passenger, who refused to speak to the sergeant, was wearing a **balaclava** mask that covered his face"\n\nNow that is one sticky mask. I wonder how they ever got it off.
She was eligible at the SAGs for sure. Not saying she couldn't be a darkhorse for the oscar win, but she was definitely eligible at SAG.
Ehh, it's a Netflix movie.
I would never have children in the world we currently live in. How anyone can react to being pushed into herd mentality with anything except disgust is beyond me.
Yes but what is it?
Oh wow, sorry, it's just that this story reminds me of the worst thing that ever happened to me....\n\nThe worst thing that ever happened to me was on Christmas. Oh, God. It was so horrible. It was Christmas Eve. I was 9 years old. Me and Mom were decorating the tree, waiting for Dad to come home from work. A couple of hours went by. Dad wasn’t home. So Mom called the office. No answer. Christmas Day came and went and still nothing. So the police began a search. Four or five days went by. Neither one of us could eat or sleep. Everything was falling apart. It was snowing outside. The house was freezing, so I went to try to light up the fire. And that’s when I noticed the smell. The firemen came and broke through the chimney top. And me and Mom were expecting them to pull out a dead cat or a bird. And instead they pulled out my father. He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit. He’d been climbing down the chimney on Christmas Eve, his arms loaded with presents. He was gonna surprise us. He slipped and broke his neck. He died instantly. And that’s how I found out there was no Santa Claus.
Ehh stop over hyping shit.
I think most those things were established well enough after the first couple of flashbacks. The one where we see him moving into a crummy apt was the one where I noticed they were just repeating information. Looking back on it, most of those flashbacks were unnecessary. The movie needed more development between Lee/Patrick in my opinion. It plays like a first act and climaxes very weakly for me.
Seen em all. My favorite of those four you mentioned was Silence. The other three I'm not such a big fan of, especially Jackie.
During his campaign Bernie suggested means-testing as a way to keep SS solvent for decades longer. That seemed very practical to me and a proposal that may have gained bipartisan support.\n\nDoes Bernie's new plan contain means-testing or has he gone full Democrat?
You know I am not a fan of Trump at all, but I have to admit this title is absolutely correct. If people were engaged and held their leaders accountable all the time we would have a much better society.
By who? Not I. Am I not allowed to dislike their films?
But those people represent all of Washington. Ergo Washington is meeting with them.\n\n/s
The real answer is that it is likely very tough for Nichols to secure financing for his films and it will become even tougher considering the under-performance of both Midnight Special and Loving. He's a great filmmaker but many of the best new American filmmakers are being left behind/forgotten about. They don't get the same amount of support from industry awards as they used to. Audiences (even educated/sophisticated ones) do not go and see their films in theaters as much as before. And in general there is no room for mid-level successes anymore in the film industry. Nichols can't really progress to a 30 million dollar more commercially minded movie and expect to find success that way. From this point on he gets to decide to do even smaller indies or the next Marvel/CGI crapfest. 
Yes, Just to be clear I would obviously like to see Trump impeached/removed from office. Not drawing any parallels between him and Harrison other than having a (hopefully) short time in office.
I felt the same. People just tend to shut out our opinions, because they don't like hearing them and they disagree with them. I believe our so called "President" would describe this as "Sad!"
Hated it then. Hate it now. So... no.
Movies are dead is what is happening.
To be fair Obama held rallies after too.
I choose death by saline.
Well she can see Canada from her house.
For what it's worth I agree with him on Noah. It just felt like a lame retelling of a bible story that no longer resonates with people. The rock monsters and the other bullshit didn't help.\n\nThe Wrestler is a good film, but I'm probably not as high on it as others.\n\nBlack Swan may be his best. Tough call between that and Requiem for a Dream.
Catholicism is at fault. These people had too many children.
And yet most of them particularly from last year were very disappointing. Ergo they are acquiring the wrong films in my opinion.
Well boy that was a random study. Hope that wasn't tax payer funded.
Reaction- Silence (Get it? Cause there's no more crickets)
I wouldn't have voted for LLL in this category, but to say the mixing/effects editing was some of the 'worst  ever' demonstrates a real ignorance towards this craft.
Ya gotta all the way to the bottom of the comments to find the level headed assessments. Perhaps Reddit needs to add a "sort by rational" option?
If you want my opinion, I think Affleck's performance brought so much of that in the present day scenes that you really didn't need the majority of those flashbacks to establish what you're referring to. To me it's a case of a director/writer not realizing when to change course and adjust based on the performance given and not what he had intended on the page. I would still criticize the film for not developing the Lee/Patrick relationship further but at least without 75% of the flashbacks we could experience the characters journeys uninterrupted by scenes that for me didn't move the action further (or reveal anything new about the characters). \n\nI've liked Lonergans other films, but for me there were choices here that didn't mesh and added up to a rather unsatisfying mixed bag.
I honestly try not to. I avoid trailers/reviews prior to seeing most films. Sometimes the circle jerk of a movies buzz is unavoidable and I'll admit that that is an unfortunate reality currently.\n\nRecently let's see, I'ved liked The Salesman, La La Land, The Founder, Hidden Figures, Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, The Edge of Seventeen, Loving, Sully, etc etc. 
Netflix is not your friend if you love movies. They are the enemy and are destroying movies as we know them.
I think the precursor awards are clearly telling a different story though. Critics Choice, GG, PGA, DGA, ACE all went to La La Land. Even The Revenant last year had lost Critics Choice, PGA and ACE. You'd have to go all the way back to Brokeback Mountain in 2005 to find a film so far out ahead that got taken down in a surprise. \n\nIn terms of major best picture awards Moonlight has only won GG Drama. It's not going to win BAFTA. It might win the WGA. There's just no real building of momentum for it to surprise at the oscars. Crash in 2005 for example had won SAG, WGA and ACE. Spotlight had won Critics Choice, SAG and WGA. A lot of times critics/people on the internet have opinions that just don't shake out or correspond to how people are responding to a film in the real world. Moonlight is respected and there are likely those who will vote for it in other categories because it's the right film at the right time. That being said, it is not loved. Moonlight is medicine to people. The vast majority who express passion towards it are either A. Not in the film industry or B. Not part of the voting bodies that the Academy actually pays attention to and therefore their opinions aren't as valuable when trying to determine what films will win in what categories at the Academy Awards on February 26th.
Sorry I couldn't get the punctuation correct. It's a tough one for me to remember how I originally heard it, but I wanted to make sure all the ideas were there. If you get a note, you don't necessarily need to take the suggestion. However you should ask yourself why you're getting a note at this part of the script. You may have a problem that hasn't occurred to you.
It must have been those pesky Galaxy Hitchhikers. 
I would rather it not exist than exist on Netflix. This is the equivalent of going straight to video.
I imagine ads are coming. This is their way of conditioning you to accept it. 
The GOP will certainly win again and for elections to come if the DNC does not reform itself. 
To each his own, but I thought Moonlight was a rather empty bore. It'll likely win screenplay and supporting actor, but by and large I think there's a number of people who were disappointed with it but choose not to say so publicly. 
You know I thought it was a horrible film. The worst film of last year in fact. I honestly think less of those who liked it. Here's more from my full letterboxd review-\nhttp://boxd.it/boeNt
Too much member berry shit. Grow up people.
Not necessarily. It's a big group of 5-6k people. Especially in close years many of them probably preferred the other nominees.
I wasn't a fan. Thought Hedges was hammy and the flashbacks added nothing. Wish the relationship between Lee and Patrick had developed more- all their exchanges just felt random and after-school special-ish. \n\nWilliams was great but underused. Affleck is really good too, but the movie made no emotional impact on me whatsoever.
I agree, but there's a subculture of insecure men who have grown up telling themselves that if they enjoy a musical then they will have to shove a penis in their rectum and it's created an associative pain disorder that occurs whenever anyone says the words "Movie Musical."
I mean if you're not driving anywhere...
He doesn't state an age. He states that relationships between older men and younger boys (which could mean any age) can be beneficial.\n\nAgain I don't even agree with him. It just seems ridiculous to basically be giving Milo exactly what he wants with this overreaction.

That takes the cake! 
>I think this piece of constructive criticism for President Trump is fair, do you agree?    \n\nHere's some of the speech so you can judge if you're correct or not.   \n\n\n>...They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.  \n\n\n>“If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.  \n\n>“He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?  \n\n>So and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.\nWe had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.  \n\n>**Here's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.**  \n\n>And we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.\nWe do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.  \n\n>I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.  \n\n>And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.  \n\n>We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\nAnd there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.\nNo wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.  \n\n>My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.   \n\n[Transcript: President Donald Trump’s rally in Melbourne, Florida](http://archive.is/9nOwG)  \n\n

the televised meeting today was eye opening. Prime Minister talked about how he's know Trumps son in law since he was little. Some mafia shit right there. 
"PLEASE LOOK IN DC BASEMENTS" ?? Wtfff
I think this Flynn resigning is the deep state setting the narrative for when the Real info is exposed. Everyone will think trump is in cahoots with Russia as anti American, and when/if arrests of these high ranking officials starts, his opposition will claim "he's doing it to deflect away from his Russia ties"\n\nAll the media will address this as a serious issue of totalitarianism from the trump administration. Him lashing out as a dictator framing everyone against him as a pedo.\n\nMedia will side with the peds and the country will truly be split in 2. \n\nAnti Christian/Muslim/atheists/Hollywood/msm vs christians/middle America. \n\nAnything from trump moving forward will be framed as him lashing out or trying to silence his opposition 
That's treason 
Literally ISIS
Sour puss 
kill it with fire!

overall I thought he was pretty pleasant. He just needs to find a middle ground between yelling and being very calm. Also, I didn't like how he yelled "YOU HAVE TO MOVE, TRAVIS"  or something along those lines. That came off as if he was bias towards Browne and wanted him to win more.
Would be crazy if trump hired her to fill in flynns place
Huh?
Rousey vs holm
Of course it hasn't helped. He shoots himself in the foot constantly.\n\nTrump is probably the best and worst person to be the figurehead of this weird "anti establishment" thing thats going on. (I'm using 'anti establishment' very loosely btw). He has just enough popularity/charisma/persuation tactics/money to get a large number people behind him, BUT for as many people who support him, there are just as many who see that and think he's terrible. \n
This guy should be shunned from the public eye and never work in entertainment again. He is literally a racist who contributed in creating a racist show
Cheap fuckers
ohh I see. So People in Trump admin will know who leaked because probably only a certain few know the 100,000 number. \n\nand wtf is this:(from the article)\n\n"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering a proposal to mobilize as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border, according to a draft memo obtained by The Associated Press."\n\n"unauthorized immigrants"??? - you mean Illegal Immigrants\n"including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border" - was this ever a reason for anything?? are you less illegal if you are further away from the border??\n\n
I was being sarcastic. I guess it didn't transfer haha. \n\nThats my point, just because trump knew him didn't mean he "knew" him if you catch my drift. \n\nmaybe he even knew about epstein and his dark secrets and turned a blind eye? that would be horrible too thought imo
any day now
Think of this. If you turned off all your news and ONLY got info from independent sources, what would you think your opinion of Trump would be?
He will end up on info wars probably.

the Nikki vs Natalya promo made it feel like a main event. I honestly wouldn't mind them doing it again at mania. Since Nikki is rumored to take time off after mania, have their next match be a "career" match. The loser has to leave wwe. Add that in with the video packages and it has a huge match feel
Impressive...
That is a DEAMON
He was/is on the Clinton payroll. No surprise he's anti Jones.\n\nfuck him
The chant is NOT in kayfabe. Whats so hard to understand about that. Its speaking more to the politics behind the scenes. \n\nBray got the chant because of his shitty booking these past few years. Many people feel he DESERVED to be higher on the card and a bigger player on the roster. Jobbing to Cena then Taker at b2b manias, and the fact that he is a unique character/promo yet not being relevant. That left a bad taste in many peoples mouthes.
Tbh that sounds oddly a lot like podesta. Listen to this vid of him speaking on election night: http://youtu.be/K_6_jf63OLI\n\nThis is a better way to compare because he's talking in a similar fashion to the style of the vid. He's trying to project his voice in both of these compared to a formal interview. \n\nEerily similar
Guilty by association 
people will see what they want to see nowadays. 
He didn't start it
To fuel the increasing racism in this country. The "white supremacist" controlling trump and the White House is a good narrative if you want to further divide Americans. \n\nBut many can't keep their conspiracy theories in line. He's a white supremacist? But I thought trump son in law (a jew) was the one in control pushing the Zionist agenda? Which one is it?
If trump wants to survive he needs to clean house now. Fire all the shady links and bring in new people. People without ties to the old guard. They will slowly destroy him
Yeah I saw that. But the fact that everyone on here has been disputing whether or not Comet Ping Pong has a basement or not is alarming now. \n\nThis was YEARS ago and shes talking about something that recently became a huge topic. \n\nTie that in with the whole "conspiracy" about underground tunnels in DC and its all starting to make sense. Also, Crystal city that is not too far from there.

Instead of when he was actually on his podcast and discussed real topics. Typical.\n\nAnd of course they choose the jones impression when the guy from tyt is on!! There's like 10 other vids of Rogan doing impressions but they choose that vid to highlight. The guy who is a known opponent of jones. \n\nWhy? To make jones look even more like a fool? So people won't watch the actual podcast that he's on with joe?
because people don't want to accept the fact that its possible. You hear about the creepy uncle or politician here and there but most people consider it to be rare occurrences.
Only dumb college students who can't wipe their ass agree with it. The same people who chant RESIST!

Look at people like McCain and tell me he isn't salavating at the idea of war with Russia. I really feel if Hillary won, we would be actively provoking them much more.\n\nEither Russian or Iran would be a target right now

Subtle threat at trump administration for cracking down on pedos? I just don't get why she would provoke them like this
That's brays theme. His entrances are rarely that long so it's never really heard.
everyone thinking they're calling the shots once they get the title. It's starting to get ridiculous. What happened to fighting the number 1 contender? I know Cyborg is in USADA limbo and theres no other fighters in the division but cmon. \n\nWe all know Cyborg is the next fight to make. Enough with this calling out stuff and fight the next one in line.

Pussssssssssssssy
Look up "dear white people". already trying to divide
Give me a break. This guy has been anti trump even before the "Russia" thing began. 
Also, (armchair psychologist) Trudeau broke eye contact by looking down. He also weakens his posture ever so slightly after that. \n\nI feel like I'm living in a alternate reality sometimes. What are people looking at..
Jon Snow
No way orton is NOT in the main event. They wouldn't just make the rumble look worthless like that. I think it will be a wyatt triple threat. Luke wins the battle royal, orton steps in and boom!
Haven't seen any coverage of this. Hopefully he gets exposed and has to step down
Honest question.\n\nIs there any evidence that directly links trump to Russia? I have just heard that he is in cahoots by association really. Like, any specific business dealings that trump has in Russia? Any trips he's made there or met with anyone? \n\nI know the dossier seems to be a big lead now but why add in the golden shower bit?\n\nEven for the pedogate stuff, I feel there are many more things that prove its validity compared to Russia.\n\nBasically, we only see trump opposition saying he has ties with Russia, but where are the independent sources backing up these claims? No Wikileaks about this? No other neutral sources backing this up? 
Is this treason?
That's because he's little diaz with elk blood!
That guy on the end left side said he would STILL vote Hillary then said to fuck off. What a douchebag. You can't fix that kind of stupid

Trump should pick ONE high ranking big name pedo to arrest. Get this ball rolling on pedo roundup. \n\nA big name arrest with enough popularity that will get EVERYONES attention(msm). Suddenly, its out in the open. Then allude that there will be more coming because its a big problem.\n\nHe needs something that gets more people on HIS side and realize the govt. is corrupt. 
This was the dirtiest card in ufc history. From the sportsmanship, illegal shots, and shady judging. It was probably the worst outcome possible. 
Also he can't take a punch well. Hence why big show rocked him bad at royal rumble 2014. But he's too slow to capitalize on it.
HELL X3
Thats true but the way its been plastered all over the "news" in order to shame him. Whereas a month ago nobody on tv gave a shit about him. That was until the riots at Berkeley.

This place eats itself alive and it's quite sad. Everyone wants to be the one to say "HA I told you so! You are stupid for believing _____. The real 'conspiracy' is _______". Even though what they believe can be just as "crazy".\n\nWe all want to act as if we are separated and above believing something that some would consider possible. Then, when some new info comes out that MIGHT prove you right, we like to shit on those people to feel good about ourselves.\n\nTruth is we ALL think some crazy shit is going on. We need to stop trying to be part of the winning team that guessed it right. \n\nWe should all be working at a common goal to find the truth (whatever it may be) and not beat each other up.
His voice was too influential. He's now resigned from breitbart. They are trying to silence him so he doesn't open peoples eyes. \n\nWhether you agree with what he says or not, what he says gets peoples attention. \n\n
so was this 100,000 national guard story intentionally put out by Trump? That way the leaker would give it to the media. Then the Trump Admin would find out who the mole is?\n\nOr was Trump actually considering this EO but it got out early and now retracting it? 
I loved that turn. The way they waited until the LAST second

Gabriel gave in to his fear and turned on the group. The last thing he was doing before he went to the pantry was reading the bible. I feel he made his choice there and lost hope. He gave up the "good fight". Being a man of faith, the figure in the car was symbolic of fear or "the devil" because he betrayed Alexandria. \n\nHe's going to try and get on the Saviors good side to save himself from being killed, but it wont work.\n\nIf you remember, the rumors are one member of the group will betray everyone. I think he is the one but Saviors will kill him and give him the Holly death instead.\n\nJust my wild theory.

It's not much different for any precocious girls but this topic falls into the categorical of puritanical-dont-talk-about-it-and-pretend-reality-is-different. There's a subversive American mindset that 13yo are children and somehow if they are interested in sex, at all, it is someone else's fault. This is despite almost all of the state statutory laws not supporting this delusion and having age brackets.  \n  \nIn the gay community you have an oppression issue where every teenaged gay guy probably doesn't want everyone in school to know. So where do they go to figure it out? Who notices first? So now there's a subculture norm that an older gay man walks the youngling through it - they even have a name for them, Twinks (which is where the MMORPG term comes from btw).  \n  \nIf the oppressive sexual atmosphere in schools could be changed then this exploitative subculture norm would become obsolete and teenagers of like age and orientation would find each other easier.  \n  \nIronically, if you take the hardline conservative stand that kids should court, not date, not have sex, and wait for marriage to have sex ... well they are against gay marriage so how does that apply now? And to what end? Do you *want* gay men and gay women marrying straight men and women? It does happens and it ruins their lives and their childrens' lives (if they have any).  \n  \nIf you think about such things long enough and untangle them you almost always end up with a libertarian answer and solution.
You need to sign the Hard to Borrow agreement.

If you accept utilitarianism as a valid ethical theory then you must accept the following:  \n  \nSince we can take the organs of a child and harvest them and use them to save many other kids it is not merely acceptable that we do this but in fact it would unethical *not to*.  \n  \nThere is 1 thing everyone should take away from philosophy 101 is that utilitarianism, "seeking to do the most good", is evil and that the theory we, as Socratic human beings and people, accept as ethical is "seek to do the least harm". This was codified in the Hippocratic oath.

If that was all that happened the Treasury might have a case.  \n  \nIn 2012 they implemented a Net Worth Sweep. The NWS takes _all profits_ from the companies and hands it over to the Treasury.  This action was not authorized by HERA and changes the nature of the take-over from 'conservatorship' to 'receivership'. HERA told the FHFA to take them into conservatorship which precisely means they are to be returned to private operation once they are healthy again (and as conservator you are responsible for making that happen ... not preventing it).  \n  \nThe losses incurred by FNMA & FMCC were book losses only. When the market recovered in 2012 the losses vanished. It's like they bought stock in 2004, the market crashes in 2008, but by 2012 the stock price is back up. Well when they did the NWS they took that recovery "profit" away from them.    \nThe Treasury invested $188B and has now been repaid >$250B (IIRC).  \n  \nThe dissenting opinion in the court judgement today was particularly harsh and called what they did a "banana republic".  \nA total dissolution of law and order.  \n  \nIf nothing is done these companies implode at the end of 2018 and take the ~~American~~ world economy with them so ... Tick Tock.

It's the longest bull run in American history (started right after he won on Nov 9^th).  \nIt has also been a swallow bull run which I think is a good sign and a counterpoint to blackswan histrionics.  \n  \nAnyone younger than about 30 has never seen what the American economy is actually capable of.  \nIt's finally coming back. ... if we start mining asteroids the progress is going to make your head spin.  \n  \nAs a small example, fuel-cell vehicles are currently an economic impossibility due to limited supplies of palladium.  \nIf it cost $200 instead of $20,000 to replace the catalyst (maybe even with a core deposit credit like alternators et. al.) then personal fuel-cell power-plants become a reality.

Even if there is a 10% ~ 20% market correction we're still looking at a prediction of an increase.  \nThis is not a coincidence with the Trump victory.  \n  \nIf you're a libertarian ... you have your free-market data and answer.
Is that why it took a year for this to blow up and why Salon just this week deleted all the material on their website by Todd Nickerson?
Your "logic" physically made my head hurt.
> Who the hell called the war on race, what race?\n\nWe called them Cultural Marxist and one of their goals is the destruction of all white races. Their logic goes something like; white people perpetuate racism so if make white people into a minority in their home countries then we will end racism. They promote free & open immigration, interracial marriage, and encourage birth-control which all conspire to create 1^st world societies that are reproducing below their replacement rate which means immigration is the only means by which to maintain society.
Wayback machine?  \nI guess it was a video the guy release on youtube talking about how he in inflicted with pedophilia but was not a pedophile.
~$64 in 2005.
The difference is many other celebrities have made similar statements, or worse, and nothing has come of it.  \n  \nThis was an organized and deliberate campaign against him.
The Failing NYT did keep the book but returned the salt.
It never did.  \nEgalitarianism is not a new word.
We read his comments.  \nWe watched the video.  \nThe short of it is you are liars.  \nThe truth this exposes is that the left cares ***nothing*** about rights for homosexuals.  \nYou've just lost another demographic.  \n  \nHe talked about his experiences and directly said the age-of-consent laws are about right (which I presume was hinting at the discrimination against homosexuality since those laws have higher age requirements than heterosexual contact.) \n  \n

Oh god ... ok let's take 'em one at a time.  \n  \n> The only things that concern me is the concept that one day we could potentially use the entire planets resources.  \n  \nWe are already at the beginning stages of harvesting resources off-planet.  There is a burgeoning orbital-economy waiting to take-off and when it does it will be one of the largest increases in wealth humanity has ever experienced.  \n  \n> The other problem is a time when machines could do jobs better than humans rendering them obsolete.  \n  \nOnce upon a time there was a job called 'Calculator'.  \n  \n> I don't think that time is now but I think it's coming soon.  \n  \nIt's coming soon.  \n  \n> When that time comes do you think it would be wise to adopt a new system?  \n  \nNo. Free-market capitalism has a mechanism of self-correcting and ensuring the allocation of resources closely follows the needs and desires of the people.  \n  \n> For me it seems like if we don't people will starve.  \n  \nEverything you are worried about has been happening for 10,000 years.  \nIt's like saying when machines replace farmers, or my slaves, I am worried people will starve. This makes no sense at all.
> Obviously the kinds of relationships he's defending here have a very high probability of being abusive.  \n  \nYeah ... that's not homophobia at all.
No. We're concerned about abusive of such irresponsible legislation.
Yeah ... none of that is a real problem but you managed to create several that didn't exist when we weren't being retarded.
The amounts involved aren't exactly smoking guns.  \nIf all of this is true it means Podesta got paid $87k for being a board member of some shitty European green-energy company and a few million was donated to the Clinton Foundation.  \n  \nBernie got more money for agreeing not to say mean things about Hillary.

No because it's part of sex and normal 13 year olds start engaging in sex.  \nThat doesn't mean we can't have any laws or limitations about it but a 15 yo seducing a 13 yo is not the same as a 40 yo having sex with a 4 yo.

Engineer checking in.  \nPlanned Obsolescence is not a scam or cash-grab. It is a legitimate engineering optimization problem.  \n  \nI know about cars so I'll use them as an example.  \nFirst, reductio ad absurdum and suppose-not; suppose the car that your great-great-grand-father bought in 1906 still worked, still ran, was still supported, etc... Ignoring Jay Leno and likewise collectors out for a Sunday drive, who in their right mind would drive it to work on regular basis?  \nWhat is the societal value in supporting a vehicle this old and still making replacement parts for it? The consequence of doing such a thing means all other parts are more expensive. Engineering time is further and further divided as time goes on. You have to have generations of new engineers replacing the ones supporting the product as they die out and those engineers now never do anything new - they will only support the existing product. You would even be able to go buy a brand new Model T today ... and it would cost $20,849. Still no radio.  \nSupporting a platform for 'forever' is silly. Now you have to answer the question "How long should a car last?" and engineering business optimization is to maximize the amount you can charge for the given value you deliver. We're not trying to build something that last "forever". We are trying to hit a specific durability target and if we exceed it then we can reduce the cost of the vehicle by reducing its durability. (I feel like Milton Friedman; you can't hold this position as a moral imperative - you are just arguing about the amount.)  \n  \nWhy put shocks on a vehicle that last 200,000 miles if the car is designed for 120,000? Why build an engine for 500,000 miles if the target is 200,000? Why perform maintenance as-if it's going to last 500,000 miles when you know it's not? Why install shocks that last 120k miles if they cost 4x as much as shocks that last 60k? The customer saves money if they replace them once. The alternative to planned obsolescence is wasted money not the creation of something that last forever and is awesome.  \n  \nI can design you a phone that last five years easy. But the caps and heat-exchangers in it are now huge and it will not be small, not be thin, and not be as light. That particular industry has decided that warranty programs are more cost effective than increasing the durability especially given that most people break their phones before the caps ever wear out.
Like shooting fish in a barrel.  \n  \n... I haven't seen the movie though and one thing Hollywood does is blue-wash history and stories.
"Swedish grenade" = IED
I don't care how much Trump pumps up the crowd with white-lies about how ***great*** some event was or how ***great*** some group or organization is.  \n  \nIt's very different for a news paper to do everything they possibly can to cast something in a divisive light while technically remaining true as to avoid libel charges.  \n  \nFor example, I consider the photo CNN ran of Trump's inauguration a lie. They didn't actually lie in the article. They said the photographs were taken at the same time of day but they didn't tell you they were not at the time of the event.  \nLater we got actual photos from the event and it shows the crowd substantially larger than what they published.  \n  \nNow combine that with post coming out on /r/politics et. al. a _week before hand_ about how Trump has no public support and no one is going to come to his inauguration. They were *field testing* their false-narrative (and probably others) to see which ones _stuck_. They got a hit on that so they ran stories on that.  \n  \nThere is zero effort made to describe facts of the matter.  \nThey try to tell you what you should think about it.
Your values strongly suggest otherwise.
Maybe McCain is going to run for President as a Democrat in 2020.
It's pretty close ... yes.
Such organizations typically donate to both sides ... but maybe not with Trump.
Jesus Christ ... keep up.  \nNo one gives two shits about where some bonafide transgender drops a deuce.  \n  \nThe problem is that the way these retards defined transgender is 'anyone who says they are' which means any ol' asshole can just claim they are transgender, put on a dress, and walk into the girls room with nefarious intent.  \n  \nA non-retarded solution would require them to *do something official* to change their gender-status such as, at a minimum, fill-out some paperwork and get a new ID.
If you consider the entire world, white people are the extreme minority by billions.
Oh.  \nIs that why there was a media-blitz to destroy Podesta after it was revealed he surrounds himself with pedophiles and pedophilic art?
Commodity product. Numerous semiconductors make them.
This is completely false.  \n  \nFirst; as production and efficient increases it ***geometrically*** enables the economic creation of new products - things that would not be possible if the costs were higher. The nascent Internet of Things would the poster-child example happening right now.  \n    \nSuppose for a moment that electricity cost $10k/kWh. Now fueling the (albeit retired) space-shuttle would cost $450B instead of $450M. If your product can recoup $450B you might still launch that satellite and you would have to charge your customers more for it to repay the launch bill. Any product that cannot support such a price will now not ever be launched.  \n  \nNow make the refueling & launch cost $4M and tell me that means *fewer launches* and *fewer products* consequentially fewer jobs.  \n  \nSecond; your notion of "close system" is an artificial boundary that is not responsibly applied to the human condition. There is a massive green-energy "revolution" underway that will reduce energy cost further and there is a lot more energy to harvest out there. We are not yet a Type 1 civilization (referring to Kardashev).  \nWe are about to start mining asteroids so the rarity of certain metals is going to change in the coming decades which is a rejection of your closed-system/zero-sum Marxism. The last green revolution (the food one) is also a direct repudiation of zero-sum. We are capable for producing more next year than this year.

I believe these are the same/similar people who attend the annual Arab festival in Dearborn and promote Christianity--then get assaulted by Muslims and arrested by the local cops for expressing their First Amendment rights. 
People seriously continue this or are they being facetious? 
And?  \nThese changes make it compatible with the existing law in all states.  \nAt 16 the US law would be in conflict with the law in several other states.  \nIf the other person is under 12 then statutory rape is automatic.  \nIt does not lower the age of consent to 12. It effectively sets 12 as the minimum age that a state can set it to.  \nLots of states have so-called Romeo & Juliet laws with special cases for teenagers.  \nFor context, in the 70's this was regarded as a feminist issue since women were regarded to sexually mature younger than boys so laws criminalizing sexual conduct 13 ~ 16 were considered sexist.  \nIf you want to say she then promotes teenage promiscuity ... maybe you have an argument but even that is weak.  \nIt's just not criminal behavior any more.  \n  \n> Recommendations  \n18 U.S.C. §3056—Change "wife" and "widow" to "spouse" and\n"surviving spouse."  \n18 U.S.C. §714—Amend the statute to provide for a female\ncounterpart to Johnny Horizon; she\nshould promote the same values as he\ndoes on an equal basis.  \n18 U.S.C. §1114—Replace "enlisted man" with "enlisted\nmember" or "enlisted person."  \n18 U.S.C. §4082—Replace "brother or sister" with "sibling."  \n18 U.S.C. §§2198 and 3614 — Eliminate these sections.  \n18 U.S.C. §2032 — Eliminate the phrase "carnal knowledge of\nany female, not his wife who has not\nattained the age of sixteen years" and\nsubstitute a Federal, sex-neutral\ndefinition of the offense patterned\nafter S. 1400 §1633: A person is guilty\nof an offense if he engages in a sexual\nact with another person, not his spouse,\nand (1) compels the other person to\nparticipate: (A) by force or (B) by\nthreatening or placing the other person\nin fear that any person will imminently\nbe subjected to death, serious bodily\ninjury, or kidnapping; (2) has\nsubstantially impaired the other\nperson's power to appraise or control\nthe conduct by administering or\nemploying a drug or intoxicant without\nthe knowledge or against the will of\nsuch other person, or by other means; or\n(3) the other person is, in fact, less\nthan 12 years old.  \n102
Just to be clear I am talking specifically about the TRP sub and likened relationship theory not about TD's use of the term red-pilled.  \n  \n> It seems to destroy the value of relationships.  \n  \nThis is blue-pill. You still *want to believe*.  \nRed-pill is a begrudging acceptance that the life and reality you wish for is not generally feasible in today's society. An exceedingly small number of people achieve this, <10%, so if you are to be practical then you have to plan on being in the other 90%.  \nOnce you accept that forces beyond your control have destroyed the nuclear family and sanctity of marriage you are left with the question ... well what's next then? What should I do? TRP offers one answer. MGTOW offers another, frankly even more red-pilled, answer. TRP is arguably part of feminism because they are providing a service that the feminist want.  \n  \nIf you are deeply religious and court, not date, et. al. and follow the classic plan for what is colloquially called Marriage 1.0 you are still faced with the reality that Marriage 1.0 is not legal. Only Marriage 2.0 is. So while you might go about your life pretending you have Marriage 1.0, she can convert it to 2.0 at any time and for any (or no) reason.

And there are such frequent issues in public bathrooms that they have special rules to address it and many communities have built family-bathrooms precisely so that you don't have to take your children into the public bathroom (when showering to get ready for a public pool, for example).  \n  \nYou're trying to conflate this with some -ism like we actively hate people ignoring the reality that we are concerned about the safety of someone else.

Might not be her first intention, usually a libel suit has to demonstrate a loss of money or potential earning to win. Her lawyer drew this up not taking into consideration her position right now and how this is a complete conflict of interest. My guess is the suit will be dropped if she can't demonstrate a loss other than her hurt feelings. She needs better lawyers that are versed in government law not just business. 
oo, thanks. I often fight with the skeptic-tards about their complete deifying of peer review and how a study can still be completely valid even in the absence of it as long as the methods are good.  Science  turned in on itself and quit looking outwards which has been holding us back for at least 50yrs. Things are struggling to break free right now but everything is so entrenched dogma and bound by corporate money that it's created a difficult road. 
I'm mildly surprised at how much I agree with this. 
I also mean that 95% of this satanic stuff is bullshit, ya there's rampant pedo but there is little to no devil worship. PG/AG/wingnuts have brought out all the religious nuts that see the devil around every corner. Ya pedo can seem like it's from the devil and would be a nice explanation for it but it just isn't happening like it's made out to be. Sure there's some lone sociopath that uses religion (jesus and/or satan) as a control mechanism but it isn't a widespread network nor is it common.

> But this H1B crap is happening more and more every day\n\nLets not forget about H2B either, these are for low skilled labor and they do the same thing or just bypass trying to find anyone in the US altogether. They use headhunters down south to bring in unskilled labor that will work for nothing with no time off and no benefits and with zero complaints about safety.  I work in an area where I know of at several large companies with hundreds of employees none of whom are from the US (these aren't agricultural either)

I'm sorry I didn't understand who you are claiming to be (thought you were trolling) your post history is consistent with your claim.

No they don't. ND just proposed a *law* to ban wind power ffs. If NC GOP had their way Duke would be able to pillage the entire state and leave it in ruins, WV would let mining corps strip away every mountain top in site and leave the waste in people's backyards.

Why ya got the cooktop jammed up next to the sink? you'll burn yourself when you wash your hands or more like the sink is kinda not usable while you're cooking and why is the sink in the damn corner in the first place? (I know it's for plumbing simplicity)  Changes: Microwave by the door, cooktop where the microwave is and fridge where the cabinet is below the cooktop.  Also add a collapsible counter to add more linear kitchen space and widen the counters since it looks like there enough room to do so.  Actually, IMO the kitchen needs to be reworked completely if its going to be used to long term living. \n\nOther than that this place looks cozy and like someplace I could live in for an extended period. I like it.

> plead guilty \n\nHe took a plea and pled guilty to statutory rape, which back then was a slap on the wrist at best. His crimes were drugging and actually raping (real authentic rape) of a 13y/o girl. \n\n>Judge Rittenband was the one who hurt me the most.\n\nya because he let polansky plea to a bullshit charge that carried no weight at all so she received zero justice. (and a bit of a guess on my part that he blamed her and probably questioned her truthfulness because that's how things were back then)
>emails..about their child raping antics\n\n\nya, except there really isn't any of this\n

people actually wanted this guy to be president?
did we really think changing the nexus of world power would happen without a fight. Every nation and every spy agency and bank on the planet has an interest in controlling our government. Trump wants to upend the entire system the world is used to dealing with, he is toying with nuclear fire and tens of trillions of dollars. \n\nWe have sided with the Saudis and Germans for decades to balance Iran and Russia. Now Trump wants to change that direction. He's made an enemy of people who have spent decades building influence in the Muslim world and in the EU. This was never going to happen without a world class spy thriller civil war.\n\nThis ride is just getting started boys. We still have the Reichstag event and martial law to watch. We still have to watch the Fed yank up interest rates to crash Trumps economy, and Trump taking it over in retaliation. This guy has been planning the presidency since the 80s and he means to make a name in the history books.

Itd be a court matter and likely a huge drag on the Trump admin. Even under the Logan act its arguable that Flynn as a National Security Advisor had every right to discuss potential policy changes due to this conversation occuring AFTER the election. Or maybe, if Flynn had ties to Russian officials during the election it would turn into a larger case jeapordizing the election outcome. They had a forced hand to cut Flynn loose to avoid the shitstorm approaching.

TIL: the Mar-a-Lago was originally constructed to serve as the winter whitehouse.

the call in question happened after the election. Flynn had every right to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. At the very minimum it's a violation of the Logan act but that would be fought in court and likely won by the trump admin. in order to avoid that drama Flynn just resigned.

and what does that have to do with shutting down a speech at a college 
the more the left denies anti white racism is a part of their platform, the more it's going to radicalize whites and push them to people like trump.
maybe you can figure out the difference between fighting an empire and its corps and fighting a gay guy from giving a speech

I respectfully disagree. I think this is worthy of ludicrous bricks!
Serious question: does assassinating diplomats impair Russia's ability to negotiate and deal peaceably with other nations? Could that be a goal here? I imagine it takes time to onboard a new person, and it takes time for that new person to build relationships and learn how to be effective in their new role.
TPTB want to be able to rapidly depopulate a nation through both war and resettlement. This way, when they decide that they need a new oil pipeline or whatever, they can essentially dissolve the population of a non-compliant state.

Hm, that could be problematic, we don't want people getting in trouble. Maybe we could slip something inside the publications, like how people do with Postsecret books?
I'm not buying this. Why would the WH want this at all, let alone now? Trump has the WH, the GOP has the house and the senate. Trump has the people behind him, more or less (never mind the fuckery and propaganda from Soros and the media). They could conceivably be looking at having enough of a majority to start passing constitutional amendments in 2018. That's a lot of power. A false flag wouldn't make any strategic sense right now.

It's about optics: if people see Ivanka sitting there, they might think of her potentially becoming president. The only thing that ol' Hilldog had to run on was her second x chromosome (presuming she is, in fact, of earth origin). Hilldog plans on running again, over and over, ad infinitum, until her death. Therefore, if people think, hm, maybe there could be a DIFFERENT first woman president, that will hurt Hilldog's only real claim. This is an engineered freak out.

When I was a kid, I was convinced that racism would be a thing of the past by the time I reached adulthood; it wasn't an acceptable attitude among kids my age. Little did I know that the media was heavily invested in it...

If the left's arguments were so airtight, then they wouldn't be so terrified of someone espousing a differing opinion. WE'RE WINNING.
I agree. No wars based on a weapons of mass destruction lie. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people would likely be alive now. All we can do is try to make sure that doesn't happen again. 
Tory Smith talked a lot about children in basements, military places, pentagon etc. before he died as well. Labeled as crazy for using "remote viewing" to see the children. Reminds me a lot of that.

Still not showing his specific comment on pedophilia being cool with words straight out of his mouth.
If she wanted to be healthy, she should have advocated non-gmo food and organic lunches. But she didn't do that now did she...
Maxine Waters too.
Absolutely not. I'm tired of these bullshit wars that get started by propaganda and lies. We're still in the Middle East 16 years later after Bush and the weapons of mass destruction lie. Obama dropped 26,000 drones his last year in office on 7 countries. I'm tired of our country going in debt more and more to "protect us" from these terrorist WE created. Bombing people for almost two decades over lies might turn someone into a radical. We need to focus on getting rid of Terrorist we have supplied with arms and taxpayer dollars (thanks Obama/Hillary). To begin to help rebuild our country as well as the countries we've destroyed. That's the American way!\n\nThese fucking imbeciles in government are filthy rich, spending frivolously on things that don't matter. Many of them don't understand what it's like to work a normal job. So they spend 20 million on "firewood in Afghanistan." They likely don't know how to save, nor have they budgeted appropriately for decades.\n\nHard working people need to start voicing up instead of being complacent. Both sides have been screwing over taxpayers, and it's hurting US the most. 30 trillion on war in the past 30 years when we could be helping our own communities. If we allow more war to continue we will become third world and starving like Venezuela. Average american has about $4,200 in their savings account every month if they're lucky right now. That is bad.

I know both Obama and Bush droned hundreds of thousands of people. Possibly millions, of course they were children but when does it stop?? Trillions of our taxpayer dollars go to funding these people whose homelands we've destroyed for almost two decades now. Over a weapons of mass destruction lie. We should be getting America back on track, fixing shit at home instead of spending 8 billion on new war planes. We should be helping Syrians rebuild their homes, so we're not forced to take refugees. Because some of them hate us, and after years of bombing, killing their families, I don't blame them. I've spoken out about Bush and Obama. They should ALL be held accountable, and if Trump continues to kill children he should be too. Why do we let them all get away with it? Why are we so afraid to do what's right? 
Every Democrat rapes children and drinks their blood to get high, but HOW DARE YOU accuse Trump of ANY malfeasance?
Lol? What? Pedogate is a partisan thing. I don't support pedophilia. Milo could be a pedophile but there's no evidence to prove as of yet, I like him as an entertainer. If there was evidence of him being a pedophile my opinion of him may have changed. I'm not going to stop liking him because he said something he shouldn't have said. He apologized for his actions and statements, that makes me a pedo-apologist now? Thanks though I always sleep well.
You're right, tons of people did vote for her. Tons of people also voted for Trump. That doesn't matter. Half of the American population didn't bother voting, like me, because I knew the electoral college meant more than the average persons vote. It's an unfortunate system, but this is what also happened to Gore. People didn't learn their lessons.
No they're both fake as fuck. Barack is an actor, great at telling us what we wanted to hear. He was good at keeping his drone record quiet from the public until the cfr released the numbers. 26,000 bombs on 7 countries last year. Obamacare covered maybe 30 million out of 300+ million Americans. I'm also from his home state of Hawai'i, and he barely did anything for Hawaiians. Ever since the bullshit Osama raid, most people know that was used for re-election since he was tanking in poll opinion. Military knew his whereabouts in Abbottabad since 2003. Who throws Muslims into the ocean as a "traditional practice" get real. To stop more terrorist from gathering at his grave? Yet we streamed Saddam's death on CNN? No death pictures either, and people ate it up.\n\nMichelle's food program was garbage. Why not implement organic food like she had her organic garden? Her rhetoric and body language during speeches imo makes her seem like she wanted more fame/notoriety. I'm sure she'll get it when she puts her acting skills on for 2020.
Fixing inner cities and infrastructure. As soon as Flint is dealt with, the turmoil and "racist/Hitler" rhetoric would slow down. Unfortunately, seems like Trump has a bunch of bozos working for him.

I understand why they're doing it. It's sad having your family members leave likely indefinitely, but many have had ample time to become citizens by now. Some have, which is great and some haven't. Personal responsibility is a big factor. If you're hiding people who are illegal at this point they should be fined. You can't walk into most other countries and expect to stay there permanently.
Schools specifically meant for creativity and innovation? I don't see anyone else coming up with ideas other than sticking them in foster homes. Or sending them with their parents. I'm not talking about schools meant to indoctrinate, but be expressive and original. Schools that help a person be different, to grow with diversity, and learn about all cultures respectfully. Not the bullshit we've been indoctrinated with. Schools that teach the truth, not a version of history that's comfortable for one culture. European to be specific, because it's obviously a one sided story. The entire education system needs an overhaul. We need to also teach children about real world issues, like racism, relationships, sex, budgeting, finance.
I was hoping with Trump's message of, "staying out of other countries, overthrowing them" that meant we'd stop the nonsensical droning. The target was ISIS, but their intel was bad and ended up killing an American girl, and a whole bunch of kids. It won't stop unless Americans become aware.\n\nHere are the stats on Obama from the CFR. Nobody was talking about these facts until they released them. Media was quiet about it per usual, he's their golden boy.\nhttp://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2017/01/05/bombs-dropped-in-2016/\n
Nope. We better be out in the streets with those resistance people if he pushes for war. War guzzles up our money. I mean he already spent 8 billion of our money on Lockheed this week!
No. Were there ever changes made for all school lunches to be organic & non-gmo? Nope.  Did she talk about the importance of organic yea, but she didn't IMPLEMENT IT. The Whitehouse served all organic meals for themselves though.  :)
Didn't see it coming out of the car, but I did see one slight arm pull as they were exiting the press briefing.
Infrastructure and getting it fixed. I desperately want to see Flint get attention soon, which he visited during the campaign trail. We need to press him to fix it though. The promise of "America First" not invading countries and attempting to continue Middle Eastern overthrows. I hope he changes his position on the ME once ISIS and other rebel factions are gone. We begin diplomacy and peace. Then we help rebuild what we destroyed over the weapons of mass destruction bullshit.
Well, that didn't last long.
They're always monitoring bro. I talk out loud because I know the NSA is creepin.
We need MEMES! Libtards don't read!
Every press secretary has lied to us over the years. That's what they do. Only later do we realize what they were actually doing behind closed doors, normally through investigative journalism. I mean Obama's press secretary didn't talk about dropping 26,000 drones in his last year in office. They lie. That's what they do and more people calling them out the better. I'm not approving of state sponsored lies, I've ALWAYS called out the bullshit government spews to us. I think Spicer should be replaced or fired, as well as Conway. 
That's your opinion and I disagree. As someone who sees them spraying every morning on cloudless days it's a problem. The more awareness the better. People are coughing up their lungs and if this is a possible cause should we not be talking about it? I'm not worrying over the problem at all, just informing others who may not be aware. :) Have a nice day.
As someone who wanted to see Saudi Arabia held accountable for 9/11 yes I'm very upset with the way the administration seems to be doing things. Was I duped? Likely, I have friends in Yemen sending me tweets and pictures of the children who died in his raid. I thought my President would be doing something to help these people being starved and shot by Houthis, not droning more of them. I understand there is always "collateral damage" but that's a bunch of bullshit. He could attack issues if he wanted immediately. I thought perhaps the Nigerian pro-Trump people would see a tweet or any kind of justice for their slaughter on inauguration day. Flint would have some statement on the water after Trump supporters loudly voiced need for fixing recently. From my perspective it seems he doesn't care. Spicer announced 8.2 billion worth of new planes from Lockheed. We had enough of that with Obama, I don't know the full story but I see how Spicer is spinning things and I don't like it. I thought perhaps he would be different. We would put America first, truly, not by continuing the oil wars and invasions. I still have some semblance of hope but that's dissipating daily. Honestly considering joining the resistance and giving them an actual cause to protest. War and foolish spending habits. 
Most Trump fans don't want to acknowledge we're going the same way as Obama/Bush. I however will. I was a full blown Trump supporter and did everything in my power to get him elected. That included campaigning, joining the meme wars, and really trying to shape perception against liberals. I realized recently that I was wrong and he could have done so much in the first couple weeks. There was much more bad than good. The purchase of 8 billion in Lockheed planes shows me he wants war.\n\nNSFW: Here are some of the children blown up by Trump. I'm close friends with a Yemen refugee who moved to Sweden, and he gets pictures from people back there daily. People need to be talking about this. Trillions of our dollars go to funding these wars and we wonder why everyone is broke? This isn't left/right this is what's right vs wrong.\nhttps://twitter.com/BasemAlabsi/status/825685862444826625\n\nThe almighty created us all equal from the same flesh and blood and so we are brothers and sisters. Why this hatred,blood shed, division between caste, creed and color. We should all take a stand and stay together helping and protecting each other rather than hurting each other. When will people realize we are the clean up crew? No one will do it for us, some wait for a savior, but the savior is YOU.
I'll be right there with you guys, I even have a megaphone ready to gather others if the time comes. I'm staying vigilant and going to do my best to wake others up. It's not a democrat vs republican issue and everyone is being played on all sides with propaganda and lies.\nThis is about our money continuing to be spent on wars we have no business being in. Once people realize it's not a left/right issue we can come together. We were given two shady teams this election, people bet on one person and many of them were die-hard fans. Hillary/Trump both have no idea what it's like to be an average American. They don't live in the projects, the middle class suburbs, or urban sprawl areas. They make more in bribes, business dealings, and closed door meetings with pharma/monsanto/the military complex. They don't learn to budget, or have to live paycheck to paycheck. Government officials make more $$$$ than any of us would see in a lifetime. Why do we expect them to know what we need? That's the question we all need to ask ourselves. 
I think that was a McMullin CIA job. Allegedly working with Soros to bring down Trump.
Practice with a friend. The better the friend the more likely you're on the same wavelength. Start sending each other messages through your mind. Practice thinking about someone, and intending that they call you. I do this one a lot.  I like to use my significant other. Give the thought of them a lot of energy, try doing this for about 5-10 minutes. They'll start to think about you. We're all connected like wifi. If it doesn't work try again later, they might just be busy. Soon enough your phone rings and it's them. Magic.
Tons of people been dying and coming back... Zsa Zsa, Jimmy Carter... Ask r/mandelaeffect but beware the shills.

Yup I remember that. Perhaps they're all just in on it together.
I respectfully disagree, he shouldn't be coming out with predictions that ultimately don't pan out. I definitely think it's important to be talking about issues like this, but calling for her to be hung right now.Or "Let #Pizzagate victims pummel her dead body like a pinata." That's definitely not something I think is productive or positive. I understand the frustration as someone who wants to make sure all the dirty politicians get what they deserve. I'm not sure how this constitutes as bullying. Ignoring the bullshit is how we got stuck with this mess in the first place. People don't take conspiracy theorist seriously because of people like him and Alex Jones.
I wouldn't necessarily say that's high profile, but I hope something comes of it. Maybe he'll name names. One of his pedo friends will be Podesta. Until then it all remains to be seen.
Beautiful
Absolutely. Thoughts become things. Praise KEK!
Very interesting. It seems a little odd that the first reports of mustard gas exposure were in 2004. Took them until 2006 to find rockets. That would change my opinion a little on why we went into Iraq, but the fact remains most of the Muslims who did 9/11 were Saudi. The war was justified by the media through the scope of terror and fear. Iraq was a country we had no business going into, or telling what to do. Even if they were harming their own people. We should've in my opinion stayed out of their business. We do it with so many other countries who massacre their own people, and don't give a crap until there's something we can use to our advantage.
If people were smart, we'd advocate the building of boarding schools. Ones we fund with an emphasis on creativity and innovation. Schools need complete overhauls to engage students, not a curriculum that requires them to memorize things for standardize tests. The schools would be a good place for them to grow and expand their horizons without being stuck in the foster system. They would also give them a sense of community, it doesn't replace family unfortunately, I know. But it would give them an opportunity as they grow up in America, and maybe to help their families who were sent back eventually. I wouldn't mind my tax dollars going towards something like that. 
Yup. I blame Bush for his weapons of mass destruction bullshit, still at war 16 years later. Obama was terrible, 100k drone strikes in 8 years. People don't like reality.
Where did he ever say pedophilia was cool?
That's what you think.
Putin also wore purple shortly after Trump defeated Hillary, what does that mean? They're just all in on it?
It was great. Topped out at 68k people watching tried to promote the shit out of it. People got the knowledge bombs.
Look at twitter, those morons are buying it.
And we always know the reports tell us the truth. An American girl died and a seal. When are we going to stop supporting these nonsensical wars? Trump just spent 8 billion on new war planes with Lockheed. I was a HUGE Trump supporter because I thought he might start killing the Houthi's starving the Yemeni people. I was wrong. He's just another war pusher like Obama/Bush. Subtle. I'm sure there will be a false flag so we push into Iran soon.
Never said she knows nothing. I said most of these new agers know nothing. People who are truly here to enlighten and bring people into a new era do not charge for their services at all. Anyone who charges you $375 for life advice or a seminar is a fraud. Real psychics/oracles don't do these things for wealth or fame. Her messages of peace/ law of attraction by ignoring reality is exactly why this world is fucked up. New agers teaching people to "think positive and visualize" promoting the secret, keeps them from reality and the problems we face. It's another brainwashing tool to get people out of touch with how shit the world really is, preventing them from actually changing it.
You know who talked about the tactic a day before it happened? Alex Jones in the Joe Rogan podcast. He knew. Bastard. 
Her makeup is awful.
Of course not, but it was a well calculated attack. Meme wars underway.
Have you been to any personally? The only people I've seen taken out were people who were blatantly disruptive or shouting nasty things. I think it would be the best place to talk to supporters instead of reddit considering everyone is anonymous. 
D and i'm being realistic. Spicer is terrible at giving briefings. Kellyanne needs to get some real facts and stop spewing disinformation. He killed a bunch of kids in Yemen in the raid. Still hasn't addressed Flint despite multiple movements by Trump supporters to get attention to the matter. He could have done SO much more and I might just join the damn resistance if this bullshit continues. 
I don't think it was a success. I've been very vocal about this and i'm highly disappointed we aren't getting rid of the Houthis militia who is actually terrorizing the region. I had a friend tweet me pictures of the children whom were in the raid. I couldn't be more ashamed. I didn't vote for Trump to be another Bush/Obama. I'm hoping this changes now that people are finally aware of what's somewhat going on in Yemen. \nSpicer is a spin doctor that's his job. He's been screwing up a lot imo, and should be replaced along with Conway.
She is. Most of these new agers know nothing. I sadly used to listen to her videos a while back and realized it was just another scam for her seminars. She's no real guru. 
If he continues bombing Yemen, and killing more innocent children I'm going to be with the resistance. Already spending 8 billion on planes with Lockheed made me second guess my decision to support him. Very on the fence right now and in these next two weeks if things don't start changing...I think i'll be out with the protesters giving them a real cause and message to be heard. Very upset he hasn't acknowledged Flint yet either, despite multiple attempts by supporters to get it fixed ASAP! We made front page multiple times trying to get that issue some attention.

Now we have all these "stans" who do nothing but tweet to/about their favorite celebrity. Cult worshipers. Internet made them more connected, hanging onto their every word/ideology.
America just secured a deal with Lockheed. 8 billion on military planes. Who is really going to attack America? Let's be real. When will we tell them to stop fucking using our money on more war? This is the time to stand up people. Obama and his 20 million on firewood. They're all bullshit. No more shall we be slaves to this shit system.

Always possible.
 Maybe it happens this year then. Last census I could find 623,727 (2015) and it was meant to be for fun. Just a guess. Relax.
Spending 8 billion on planes, is that still necessary?? Go with his narrative if that makes you feel better. Still wastefully spending.
Start marching like South Korea did.
Perhaps he wants to talk to his supporters, find ways to heal the divide, and thank supporters for their work getting him elected. He has to make sure republicans stay in office to push his agendas through. I don't see a problem with it as long as he continues to do what he promised. I wish infrastructure would get attention immediately, but that's not something that can be fixed overnight. 
You need the hair flip with the water and this is 100.
Why is that their favorite color?
Which he apologized for today, but proving my point still. Never said pedophilia was cool. Most girls back in the day were being married off to men to bear children at that age. Most around that age are generally having sex at 13, and I think that's horrible, but it's reality. Again where did he ever say pedophilia was cool. He didn't. 
When is she going to jail?
I agree, and I don't like that mods are censoring shit. But many of us call it out and want to have conversations. That's why I come here, I don't see too much of the censorship. Pol is the same way, anything negative about Hillary and I would get a shadow ban. They are both echo chambers for their own political ideologies. A rally might be the same, but most people I feel like would want to talk about issues. Real life isn't the internet. People need to be communicating in times like this.
I think killing 10 children in Yemen his first week in the botched raid was his first big fuck up. Seeing the faces/blown up kid bodies was terrible. He needs to end these bullshit wars and stop spending billions on military. What happened to Flint? Helping the vets? I guess that just comes later. Not impressed so far.\n\nBest thing i'd say.... I'm not sure I don't think he's done much yet. You could say TPP, the ban (but that kind of failed the first day)\n\nSTILL WAITING ON THOSE TERM LIMITS.
yES. It's to smear the right with pedophilia. McCain is doing it to cover up for Obama/Biden and the rest of the pedogate crew.
LOL I'm psychic AF! Next comes the burning tweets.
Not sure why you're bringing black people into this. Are you alluding that he's some kind of KKK member? Are you a racist, bigot, homophobe?\n\nNope just wanted to point out that you tried to make an argument which was untrue. Facts matter right? He never specifically said pedophilia was cool. Have a nice day! 
McCain is a pedo. Covering up for Biden and the rest of the pedogate family.
That's what my friend who fled from Yemen, whom now lives in Sweden told me. He has contacts who send him information and pictures on a daily basis. Feel free to go through his twitter feed. Tons of dead children thanks to Houthis (starving them), Saudis, and America (droning/bombing). I wish I could put hope into this larper, but Trump has not been impressing me as of late.\n\n\n30 people total died but media doesn't report they were mostly kids. I understand "Al-Qaeda" does this to protect themselves, surrounding themselves with children. But FFS we've been funding and arming them for years now according to Tulsi. They should have had gathered more intel.\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/yemeni-officials-u-s-makes-surprise-raid-killing-alleged-al-qaeda-leaders/
We gotta turn these into memes too. Most people can't read more than a couple paragraphs. 
Here you go, a bit on Resnick hospital as well. Owned by Hillary's donors.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5i29lt/how_hillary_got_to_kanye/
Yup :) the more you practice the better you get! Kids do stuff like this all the time but we forget, and become indoctrinated in "reality". 
Is your position that global warming (on the scale of having major negative impacts on the environment) is fake? Or do you believe it is real, but the proposed solutions are unacceptable?\n\nForcing individuals to be responsible for their unpriced externalities seems to be one of the uses of government power that most ideologies would agree on. Do you support any means of preventing someone from poisoning the air for everyone else? Or does freedom mean that the oil industry gets to make our planet uninhabitable and there's nothing we can do about it?
There's always a canal... or an inlet... or a fjord
Oh god, was attacking Eich in Mystery Heroes last night and the other team started with 3 D.Vas while we had no tanks. Miserable.
PG proponents are big fans of the ol' Gish Gallop. Point out how weak any one piece of evidence is and they'll swamp you with a barrage of equally weak evidence. And then it's "What, you didn't watch these dozen shitty 20-minute long youtube videos? You aren't even looking at the evidence, shill!"
Breitbart is the state media now and somehow heavily upvoted on the conspiracy sub.\n\nNot that I'm trying to defend Obama's itchy trigger finger, but yeesh, pick ANY other source. 
It's totally inaccurate to compare Zarya's damage to someone like Soldier or McCree without mentioning that she can't headshot.\n\nIf you're gonna go off the extreme best case scenario of Zarya at 100 charge then compare it to offense characters landing all headshots. Suddenly there's a huge difference. 
Two replies to your comment. One calls you a shill and the other implies you're a pedophile. Neither with any kind of actual argument. Amazing level of discourse on this subject.
I never said the media didn't discuss Trump scandals. They spent a few days on each one and moved on, while Clinton's emails got covered for months ALL of which was negative coverage.\n\nOne dumbass saying it's illegal to read them doesn't mean they were ignored. If Hillary had her way there wouldn't have been 1% the coverage of her emails. No, they didn't spend an hour a night reading off emails verbatim - because they care about ratings and money over everything else.\n\nThe media was pretty nice with Obama ( though even he didn't get worshipped like McCain), but they fucking love Clinton scandals. The "liberal media" narrative has always been a Republican effort to discredit any criticism and set up a claim that lazy, shitty MSM reporting is the equivalent to organizations like Fox or Breitbart with a purely ideological motivation.
Make sure to throw in a shill accusation so he knows you're open to a thoughtful conversation.
DAE think that all MSM is FAKE NEWS that only FUCKING IDIOTS believe?
Sym's turrets also do 30% less.
Gotta love how common these comments have become.\n\n"You're pushing back against my baseless, politically-motivated pedophilia accusations, there's no way anyone would do that unless they're in on it!".\n\nHow little empathy and thoughtfulness does it take to think that way?
I've been watching Zzyzx's bronze-gm as support series and been amazed at how often he gets 2 tanks and 2 healers. Maybe the people that low realize they aren't some amazing talent that's gonna carry the team, while there's often 4 people on a team with that mindset in gold-plat. 
Pro-Trump partisans conjure up a claim that their political opposition is comprised of pedophiles. Now anyone who argues against this extreme demonization of the opposition party (Trump is the fucking POTUS with control of Congress) gets called a shill and/or pedophile along with vague threats.
its acutally 130.2 **dB**
Nowhere in my comment did I even imply that Trump himself was involved in pushing the theory. So, an aggressive, bad faith response to my comment and an instant swarm of upvotes for it. I didn't MAKE you defend Trump - I didn't even say anything about him.\n\nClearly the people pushing PG have no agenda...
Might be worth it for the damage reduction more than the damage boost. 
Don't worry, folks here only want political opponents of the incoming POTUS to be routinely investigated for horrible crimes despite the lack of actual evidence.
Damn, that's one advantage to console - I got someone a temp ban from Xbox live for messaging me saying to kill myself because I played Zarya on defense.
I doubt that most people complaining about SJW's even run into them directly someplace like Tumblr. Usually they're getting cherry-picked examples of dumbasses (or trolls...) shown to them by places like TiA or 4chan.\n\nIt seems silly that a lot of folks' political beliefs are heavily reinforced by "look at these dumbass 19 year olds that hold an opposing belief system". College aged kids are fucking dumb, it's nothing new. What seems new is the conservative movement to put these dumb people front and center so they represent the other side. Suddenly "everyone on the left" is an SJW idiot and you don't have to argue against adults with well thought out positions.\n\nIt should raise a red flag when the other side is hand picking the representatives of a group. Folks arguing against these SJW's should try to imagine liberals disregarding their opinions completely by instead cherry picking the facebook page of some 19 year old coal-rolling racist dumbass from Appalachia and using the stupid political posts therein as a strawman for all opposing beliefs.
This place is apparently run by Tipper Gore.
Wow, and now his post is deleted.
Or look at any thread where discussion of trans folk arises. Lots of people who hate "the establishment" love punching down.
Yeah, it's the shit show QP games with 3 flankers and no Rein on the other team where I have the most trouble getting charge. 
Can you imagine the freakout from redditors if police started investigating folks for possessing or watching anime with sexualized depictions of under-18 girls?
Cherry picking? There were like 3 words in your comment that weren't just insults or misrepresentation. And I don't feel like convincing you that /pol/ and The Donald are pro-Trump/anti-Dem. 
CNN posted a story about Watergate so it never happened.
Everyone thinks their rank was determined by just pulling random numbers out of a hat.
Everyone is going so far out of their way to avoid admitting any fault on the part of the Trump administration. Even when the dude is forced to resign it's ACTUALLY because he's a valiant hero facing down those anti-Trump pedos.
Great post, but I am definitely seeing plenty of 3 tank/solo heal games in console platinum. Of course, Rein is never one of the three and the DVa/Hog/Zarya are clearly DPS mains picking tanks because they're "OP" and playing with no regard for defending teammates.
I was just in another thread here where someone flipped the fuck out that someone used the NYT as a source, but people happily upvote garbage like this. 
It was very strange - I didn't even have a bad game, got a bunch of silver medals. Never heard anyone mention Zarya being bad on defense. Guess he was just pissed about losing and looking for any reason to lash out.
Switch to PC or play with a controller. You're being a total dweeb using a mouse on console.
I wish I got your games. In plat-low diamond on Xbox there are so many games with three tanks and one healer (almost never Ana). Then the tanks are clearly DPS players picking the flavor of the month with no interest in protecting their team.\n\n(disgruntled tank main tired of going healer, btw)
It's still pretty nice getting the boost when de-meched. Almost guarantees you'll charge up Call Mech before dying.\n\nDoes anyone know if the extra damage from Nano gives extra ult charge?
I was gonna argue that it wouldn't matter because no one would boost Lucio over 76, but then I remembered teams are already running quad tank.\n\nWho usually gets the boost in 4 tank?
Top right, directly below your win rate.
People say she's a Hog counter, but he can kill her pretty damn easily compared to most heroes. I'm always most worried about the opposing Hog. 
Your rank is your rank. The only time the system will be requiring you to carry is if you queue in a group with a much lower average rank than your own. 
Jesus Christ, in #7 some guy literally says "the day of the rope is coming" and when called out for using violent white supremacist lingo responds with the old "you liberals love to make everything about racism" and brings up Pepe.\n\nThis couldn't be any dumber or more irritating. There is literally no other meaning to that phrase besides the violent white supremacist one. Holy hell. 
I see almost no one on "the left" pushing for a war with Russia. This claim that Dems (and Hillary in particular) are itching for war with Russia seemed to show up exactly when Trump defenders needed an excuse for Putin's preference for their candidate.
Cheering on the soon-to-be most powerful man in the world as he shuts down a no-name reporter trying to ask a question.\n\nPretty cool anti-establishment sub here. 
Exactly, if they were willing to risk the ban they could quit at the beginning, get their SR loss, and immediately start another game due to that one being cancelled. No upside to quitting right before it ends. 
I'm willing to bet that many more people start as Trump supporters/Dem haters and are receptive to PG because of it than the opposite causation you're describing. 
It's funny, if anyone who has ever been in the same room as a Clinton dies they retroactively declare that person was killed for standing against the almighty Clintons. Have they ever once called it that someone would be killed BEFORE they actually die?
My phone has a bunch of those from posting in the ALL CAPS weekly threads on the main OW sub. 
Good thing the POTUS has a personal army of keyboard warriors to go after his political opponents for their degenerate taste in art. 
Roadhog's ability to do consistent damage from landing hooks was nerfed. Zarya already got two nerfs to gaining charge. That only leaves Rein and Winston.
Yeah, I realized I was mistaken about the time right after I posted. I was either thinking of a different one or just wrong.
Pretty certain I saw Moommoon figure this out within 15 minutes of the map going up on PTR.\n\nThe bug shouldn't have even made it to PTR. 
Everytime someone asks for Winston buffs it gets brought up that he's occasionally used in pro games so he's not underpowered. That's fair enough, but in normal play it's just so difficult to have success with him and so easy to shut him down.\n\nI love playing tanks and would like to play Winston more, but I don't have an awesome healer and Zarya combo to keep me from getting blown up. And the other team doesn't need much skill or coordination to shut him down. Busted him out in QP yesterday, other team had a Reaper to start with - fine, I can work around that. A couple minutes into the game and the opponents break out a DVa as well and that was that - just couldn't do anything at that point and had to switch.\n\nHe has his uses, but Winston just gets countered too hard by too many heroes. 
I've had similar horrible luck with Mystery Heroes. I think part of the problem is that some map/sides are just at a huge disadvantage, mainly attacking when there's a nasty chokepoint (like Eich or Hanamura). So when you queue up you tend to get put into one of those games from people quitting. Then, if you don't get a couple tanks (especially a Rein) it's just ridiculously hard to break the choke.
I hope when they fix this they leave the charge from bubbling a falling teammate. It's a fun silver lining to get charge off a booped teammate. 
...and then comes the Chinese nightclub story.
For real, surprised I haven't seen more people complaining about this.\n\nWe've all spent enough time on your winter maps, Blizzard, let us play some KOTH in mystery heroes again. 
I THINK they just phrased it poorly and she can now consistently block the follow up shot after hooking someone.
And here you see a clear example of how Trump supporters are using baseless pedophilia accusations to shut down criticism of Trump. THIS is the fucking problem with the folks pushing Pizzagate.
The angry D.Va mains are downvoting you, but you're clearly right.\n\n200/400 is better than 400/100 against most heroes (especially with headshots factored in). Double movement speed while shooting more than makes up for an 8% DPS loss. Release Defense Matrix was absolute garbage compared to the current one.
I'm a Zarya main and it annoys the crap out of me that this stayed in. Probably won't play her on this map because I won't abuse it and I'll rage out from facing a max charge mirror constantly.\n\nedit: This comment got shit on so I guess I'll clarify my point. Zarya is my favorite and best hero, so for me there's a certain amount of pride on the line when facing a Zarya on the other side. It feels especially good to outperform them and especially bad to get outplayed by them. Earning charge is a huge part of playing Zarya well. If I'm getting clowned on by a Zarya who shows up at the point with 60+ free charge every fight I'm gonna get super frustrated over getting "outplayed" thanks to an exploit.\n\nDon't know why this is sentiment is getting hated on so much. I guess I'm supposed to be totally emotionless at all times when playing.
As a Zarya main in low diamond, I would say that Hog can definitely work against her. I play a fair amount of pig and know how annoying it is to get hog-blocked by the projected bubble, but he's a huge threat to Zarya.\n\nZarya played well is hard to kill because she's always peeking from behind cover and teammates and being aggressive when her bubbles and shield health are up. With most other sources of damage I can reactively bubble and make it to safety when my positioning is good. The hook, however destroys plans, leaving me out of position and at half health - or lower. Once hooked my only real hope is for the Hog and his teammates to be passive and refuse to blast through my bubble.\n\nSource: had one of my best nights on Zarya yesterday and enemy Hogs were the biggest thorn in my side.\n\nedit: oh yeah, and don't be afraid to bust out the Forbidden Combo and use your ult to finish an annoying Zarya after the hook combo. You'll plough right through the bubble and kill her that close up - then it's back to spawn with zero charge. I fucking hate when Hog wrecks me that way.
The votes are going against you here despite clearly being in the right. "People thought Ana was bad before they learned how to play her so she must not actually be good" is a nonsense argument. Even if we leave the tank meta and go back to 'only' two tanks on each team she would be invaluable for being able to heal those two instantly.\n\nPlus, she isn't even bad at healing squishies, it just takes more aiming skill. The meta being determined by the best players means that pro Anas would have no problem healing Genjis, Tracers, and whatever other hard to hit targets. She'd still heal them way faster than Zen or Lucio and from a much safer position than Mercy. And then you add in her awesome sleep dart, offensive grenade power, and high damage gun. Nerfing tanks wouldn't make Ana any less necessary.\n\nNormally I think people in the more serious OW subs give this one too much shit for its level of discourse, but everyone siding against you here is making me rethink that.
Weird, I have no idea.
You never hear actual liberals going on about their love for CNN or The Washington Post. At most we'll say they're more trustworthy than Breitbart.\n\nBut every conservative will tell you we're in cahoots with these media groups that gave 10x more coverage to Hillary's emails and Benghazi than they did to any one Trump scandal.
Yeah, pretty sure I saw All/Rising looking like that when the last Project Veritas video was released. Of course, the NYT doesn't have the sterling journalistic reputation of O'Keefe.
Twitch emoji of a robot face, folks use it when joking about viewbots. 
Probably afraid of doxxing.
I remember going down that rabbit hole of links to find the source of the child-coffin maker claim. I think it turned out that the guy had once made a sign for a metal concert venue where there happened to be a cartoonish, small decorative coffin on a shelf. And from that you had people speaking with the utmost confidence that the guy made child coffins for a living.\n\nMost of the PG claims turn out like that if you try following them to their origin.\n\nIt was the same when I tried looking up the claim that the traffic camera outside CPP was moved before the shooting. The trail of links just led back to some guy, after the shooting happened, posting on Voat that he had INTENDED to post before the shooting that the camera was moved, but never got around to it until after.
How is no one mentioning the political aspect?\n\nIt's really simple why myself and a lot of other people push back against it: the theory was conjured up by Trump supporters to attack Trump's political enemies.\n\nIf you've got it in you, try to take a step back and look at this from the perspective of someone who dislikes Trump and does not find the evidence for PG remotely compelling.\n\nIs it really that surprising that people would push back against poorly sourced pedophilia accusations thrown around against the political opposition to the most powerful man in the world? A personal army of supporters to the President trying to discredit every prominent member of the opposition party (the one with little actual power at the moment) with the most horrible accusation imaginable.\n\nIf you're a member of the Democratic party or simply anti-Trump you're a potential victim of this witch hunt. You see it here all the time - someone speaks out against PG (or even Trump in general) and gets called a pedo or pedo defender.\n\nAre the people pushing PG capable of imagining being on the other side of these accusations?\n\n\nedit: Just thought to check and of course OP is a T_D poster. This post is basically "I used pedophilia accusations to push a political agenda and some people fought back - pretty suspicious, eh?"
I don't see anyone proposing war with Russia, but I'm sure it's easier to argue against that straw man than actually make the argument that Trump possibly colluding with Russia is acceptable or shouldn't be looked into.
She was my highest winrate hero in Season 2, even though I didn't play her much because I find Zarya more fun. I never understood how she was considered bad before, but I'm just a low diamond player.\n\nI wonder if, between the Zarya nerfs and Ana's rise, DVa would have become meta this season even without the buffs. 
I love the "Pizzagate isn't partisan - Dennis Hastert is a pedo" manuever. It's pretty common, too.\n\nHe was convicted in a court of law and he's no longer relevant in politics. Somehow that's supposed to balance out flimsy accusations directed at basically every major player in the Democratic party... and no one affiliated with Trump. 
> Except for the fact that Republicans have also been accused of being involved.\n\nTrue, I've seen John McCain and Lindsay Graham accused here (from some FBIanon /pol/ post). Of course, they just happen to be the two highest profile anti-Trump Republicans.\n\nOh, and we're supposed to give people credit for not denying Hastert's well established crimes.
Honestly, I think the kid just "went for it" and failed. \n\nTrue dat tho, no conspiracy. 
I've been levelling a smurf for the same reason and trying to not be a total asshole about it. About to reach 25 and do placements, QP MMR has been tanked with a bunch of Genji time (I try to win, but suck with him).\n\nFigure I'll play a bunch of Mercy in my placements so I can contribute without carrying and let the other 11 players determine the outcome.\n\nHowever I'm a diamond player trying to place in gold so it's a lot easier. Don't see how a GM can place in bronze without fucking over everyone. 
I hang around here, but mostly hold back from getting into these discussions because of how people react to skeptics. Hell, yesterday I saw someone tell a PG skeptic that they were being put on a list for further investigation. It seems like being called a shill is the best case scenario - you might get called a pedophile or threatened with doxxing even.\n\nI just wish people would keep in mind that PG was started up and spread by hardcore Trump supporters as a way to damage his political opposition. It's very justifiable for a skeptic to passionately argue against folks using pedophilia accusations to push a political agenda.
And now you're downvoted and called a shill. Just for calling out some obvious "my girlfriend lives in Canada, you wouldn't know her" bullshit.
Armor heals at the same rate as health, but people say that the "effective healing" on armor is higher since 75 armor from an Ana shot has more value than 75 health from the same shot.
Seriously, she's still the tankiest character in the game as far as health+armor AND she has an awesome damage blocking skill AND great mobility on a short cooldown AND a second life when de-meched AND can ult for a new mech.\n\nMaybe the nerfs are too much, but people saying she was easily shredded are being ridiculous.
So the pro players and Top 500s are bad? Because they all play D.Va and not Reaper, despite the supposed value of a tank-buster in a tank meta.
I don't even play this game (came from r/all, but played plenty of previous BFs) and I'm annoyed by the pro-sniper comments.\n\n"You're being a whiny bitch by being annoyed by all your sniper teammates. Keep running in there and getting destroyed due to a massive numbers disadvantage while your teammates take potshots from a distance. Oh, and do it with a smile on your face while you hopelessly lose or you're taking things too seriously."
I get that and I'm not saying my reaction is reasonable, but if I'm always getting beat by a Zarya on the other team with much higher charge I'm going to (rightly or wrongly) assume they got charged from the exploit. No need to tilt myself when I can just pick a different hero for that round. 
So many Shimada Brothers during the weekend.
Plus Mei's ult has much more wind-up so you can reactively eat it when the voice line starts. 
Well, I don't think he was actually "out of the loop" and looking for an explanation, anyway. Just trying to use your sub to grandstand.
Are you signed in? If so, try signing out and then going to the URL for your profile. I've never made an account or signed in on Overbuff. Can't think of another reason your own stats would display differently.
I did just now, but just because of the combination of whining about a downvote while saying something false (about the mods here deleting Trump conspiracies).
There's so many more posts about Pizzagate on the front page here than there are about the Russia-Trump dossier (even if you count the ones removed by the mods). What kind of ratio is OP looking for before it's enough - I'm guessing right around 100%PG/0% anti-Trump.
That's amazing. Some anon on /pol/ (an extremely pro-Trump forum) says "this is fake, I made it up and was the source" AFTER the story comes out while providing absolutely no details or evidence and that's enough evidence for the mods there.\n\nTry to imagine some random Tumblr page posting "Pizzagate is fake, I made it up" and that being enough for the mods there. 
I think people here are way too eager to disregard anti-Trump protestors as paid provocateurs, but that comic is pretty weak.
Thank you for bringing up Donahue. I believe he was the highest rated show on MSNBC at the time too.\n\nOne of the many reasons why the "liberal media" meme annoys me so much (along with other bullshit like Howard Dean's scream, Kerry's swiftboating, and the scrutiny of Gore for daring to wear earth tones).
Definitely a ridiculous number. Overbuff has my 27.5k as 99th percentile (I have bad habits of playing passively and letting my shield take damage for no purpose). 
Crap, they still didn't fix that? I quickly gave up on comp during the Season 2-3 offseason due to the quitters.
Yeah, I'm surprised to hear him claiming that Rein is rough to play at 3700. I play on console and even at low diamond solo queue I have a lot of success with Rein. It's only in platinum and lower that I find it frustrating.
Well, they would be right if they did...
Don't have much time right now, but I think this quote is inexact
It's amazing how damn obvious it is. The /pol/ post literally said, "They still believe it. Guys they are truly fucking desperate – there's no remaining Trump scandal that's credible". It's so clearly a Trump partisan trying to preemptively discredit ANY Trump scandal \npresent and future.
You should learn how analogies work before pouncing on every opportunity to act smarter than someone else. 
Trump won so it's time to stop saying anything bad about him?
No idea why you're downvoted, that boss was a joke.
> escalate this to an agent that doesn't use specious arguments and character attacks when they're backed into a corner and outed like you are\n\nYou literally used a character attack in the sentence where you accuse him of making character attacks.

I am so sorry for your loss. \nPlease don't beat yourself up with "Coulda/Shoulda/Woulda" thoughts of things that might have prevented what happened. It won't change anything, and it won't bring her back. Know that she was loved, even if she didn't realize how much, and know that "the world won't stop for your broken heart," so you have to keep moving forward.

It works! I had no idea what to expect. But soaking the polenta brought the cornmeal back to the moist texture of corn kernels. Then cooking it in the rice cooker turned it into this pure corn puree...I used too much water in the rice cooker, though, so it was a bit runny fresh. I put the rest into a glass baking pan and chilled it in the fridge. It hardened up and I fried it the next morning with eggs and topped with cheese...OMG, good stuff!\n
Hi, and welcome!\nWhat is the deepest you have found "signs of man," e.g. shipwrecks, pollution, anything, and in a totally wacky train of thought, do you think it would be hazardous or possible for man to attempt to 'incinerate' waste by dropping it into an underwater volcano, and do underwater volcanoes expel hazardous material into the water, as surface volcanoes expel ash and poisonous gases into the atmosphere? Thank you!

I have a 10 cup Zojirushi I won in a Facebook contest 4 years ago. I LOVE it! My favorite thing (besides Royal brand Basmati rice) is to bake triple chocolate fudge cake mix cakes in it! Mix according to directions on the back of the box, but don't whip, just stir the ingredients together, pour into the rice cooker, and cook on the 'cake setting' TWICE (once isn't long enough). Makes a nommy dense fudgy cake. I then make a boiled flour "ermine" frosting that I spread over the cake while it is still slightly warm, and the put it in the fridge to chill overnight. Beyond decadent.

That rant was written 6 months BEFORE the Flow Hive was even shipped out, and was based upon the Kickstarter campaign to fund mass production. MANY beekeepers whined about it SIGHT UNSEEN, not owning one, nor knowing anyone who did, because they had not yet been shipped out. AFTER the Flow hives were shipped, MANY PROFESSIONAL beeks (beekeepers) were more than willing to stand up and say that YES, THEY WORK. NO, they are not magical, and you still have to be an active beekeeper, but to harvest the honey was far less invasive, intrusive, and more energy efficient in getting the honey. "Traditional" methods involve either destroying the honeycomb to get to the honey, or using expensive centrifugal machinery to "spin" the honey out of the honeycomb so that it can be re-used in hives. Both of which are messy, sticky, and time/energy consuming. You don't see many condemning videos or articles after Dec. 2015, because that is when the Flow hives started shipping and people got to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nWhile that yahoo, and many like him, were "beetching" about the Flow hive, sight unseen, others - including well-respected beeks like Michael Bush, as well as bee researchers from UCLA and the University of Newcastle (among others) HAD Flow hives, and declared them "revolutionary" in how honey could be harvested.\nhttps://www.honeyflow.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwhvbABRDOp4rahNjh-tMBEiQA0QgTGi-n5Y7rxKbzZnvFp-sUxh6nWu3gPCVmIoRokA-LBLQaAlHy8P8HAQ\nBut the whiny babies, of course, got more attention...

To go back to when my mom was still alive, and tell her I love her one more time.\nTo go back and pet all my kitties through the years one more time.\nTo go back and bitch slap myself before marrying my first husband... :D
And for people who keep bees (some call ourselves 'bee guardians,' as bees are free-living insects), 'Pure sugar' is NOT "pure." Those who care, supplemental-feed their bees only pure CANE sugar, not the sugar beet 'pure sugar,' which truly, isn't. Love bees. Without them, we wouldn't 'bee' here at all...
That was how I ended his name for years..."---, may he rot in Hell for eternity," was how I phrased it...lol! I refuse to bitch slap myself over him, though. I beat myself up enough mentally over choices I have made in Life. He beat on me enough over the years. I refuse to help in his efforts. That was why I left him in the first place.\n
The expression on your face gives the impression that you are generally clueless about life. I bet people lower their expectations of you when you look at them like that, and they still end up being disappointed.
Other than  /u/PM_ME_YOUR_CUNT, who does?
I couldn't find this post listed under r/news...was it moved/removed? I thought some of the other contenders (Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin) would get more votes than they have. I also found it interesting that Michelle Obama got 1% more yes votes than Barack Obama.\n
That crappy haircut will take forever to grow out. The good news is it can't look any worse than it does now...

How do you feel about "haute cuisine's" use of visual flourishes like, "the underplating squiggle" of a sauce, or the insertion of something firm, from a cookie to chocolate, or bread stick, into a dish before serving? or the time-honored 'edible flowers' garnish?\nDo you think such devices "gimmicky," and if so, what ways do you think plating and presentation can be best utilized? I cook well, but my food often ends up "ugly." Delicious, but inedible looking. Not by design, either. I think I am plating things unbelievably badly, making each element look like an escapee from a mountain refugee camp...
Looks like you've given up even trying, except for the eyebrows... Ugh, indeed.

I'm almost 60 (that is a glitch in itself - I don't know how I got this old...seems sudden), and poinsettias were always a Holiday Plant, but for many many years, you could only get them from florists. Then K-Mart and Target stores came into being, and they started becoming more available. Then Home Depots, and Lowes, and Wal-marts made them ubiquitous. I once and only once saw one that had curly leaves. I'd love to find one of those!\n
You frown WAAAYYYYYY too much. That crease between your eyebrows will only get worse from here if you're just 18 now...

Be like water. Always move forward, going over or around obstacles, letting nothing stop or stagnate you. Don't dwell on the past, as water does not dwell upon places it has flowed past.
I'm not sure which is worse, the actions of the crazy mother, or the vigilante response this has been getting (mostly on Facebook)...

Considering current IQ testing, what 'difference' in intellect are you hoping/expecting to find by crowd sourcing your testing, and what sort of 'intellectual capacities,' are you expecting such crowd source IQ tests to benefit?
Please excuse me if this in ANY way reads as condescending, or bossy, or anything negative.\n\nWhile I'm sure people have told you, "it's all in your head," or some such (like it would be all in your big toe...), there IS some documented evidence that self-affirmation can and does play a part in such situations.\n\nHenry Ford, I believe, once said, "Think you can, think you can't, either way you will be right." And as an old Hippie from the late 60's, I remember the first time I took LSD, and how I was concerned about 'freaking out,' and trying to fly off a building or kiss a train, or something equally stupid, as I tripped.\n\nMy friend looked me straight in the eye, and told me, "You'll only freak out, if you tell yourself that you are freaking out. Just breathe, relax, and remember that everything is fine, and YOU are fine." And while drugs are bad, mmmmkay?, the advice was invaluable. I have gotten through MANY situations by simply telling myself, "You're fine. You're fine. Just do this. You're fine." \n\nYes, it is still hard to face your fears. But imagine  how much harder it was for people who really were in Life and Death situations?\nOur lives are challenging and scary with almost every breath. But, we survive. If all the horrid things we worry about really happened, the human race would have been extinct long ago.\n\nIt's fine. YOU are fine. The world has turned and will keep on turning. And YOU have a special place on it. Don't let your fear limit what you can do. All you have to do, is tell yourself to buck up, and relax. It's fine. YOU are fine. Just do it. LIVE your life, don't let your life live you.\n\nIf you can simply approach any or all of your fears, and let yourself relax, firm in the knowledge that regardless your fears, you recognize that things are fine, you're okay, and an asteroid is not yet visible falling on you, you will live as the rest of us do.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt told America, "The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself."\nRelax, and just do it. You're fine.

Murders would imply deliberate actions. Heartaches are seldom deliberately inflicted, and breakups often affect both parties...So would a breakup be a murder-suicide?

That is an awfully huge head stuck on a very tiny neck. No wonder you're only posting half of it in the pic. You must look like a basketball stuck on a pencil with hair and blackheads.
THANK YOU for the clarification. The series had its ups and downs, but WAS well done, overall. Michael Madsen in the "fat guy given fake abs costume" was too over-the-top, tho. And the whole "flying into the sun" ending just jumped too big of a shark for me...It takes 8 minutes for light from the sun to reach the Earth, and these two were flying there to 'destruct?' I wonder what they talked about during the travel time...I was envisioning something along a "new X-Men" type of Season 3, but it was getting too hard to be excited about all the petty drama being injected between the Powers characters, and was quickly becoming boring, so I'm sad, but not that surprised. I hope Sony does try again though.
No, because I don't think I've met many men who use the term "kitties." Too foo-foo sounding to be "manly..." And yes, I'm a crazy cat lady, but down to 3 kitties now...You are a wise and astute individual.
If ever there was a situation that made me want to believe in a god, ANY god, to fight against evil and defeat it, this is it...I came here to ask -  How do you plan to get the world to even LISTEN to you, much less BELIEVE what you are saying, and showing, and literally connecting the dots to help the logic flow challenged, not that essentially the entire movement up to NOW, has been so easily dismissed as a bunch of tin-foil hat, conspiracy theorists from Reddit and 4-chan? \n\nMy SO is so aggravate at me for even reading this stuff, and todays news was POUNCED on as,"See? I told you it's just a bunch of nutjobs..." We see eye to eye on almost everything, and both were thrilled when Donald Trump became our president-elect. But this is almost as bad as families where one supported "u-no-who," and the other supported Trump. But I honestly admit that at this point maybe I do belong with the tin-foil hat club. It's frightening, and the PR against it is going to make credibility an uphill slog.\nWhich brings up something. Some of the weird rabbit-hole burrows have led to a comment that this is all one of those "bait and switch" situations, and come EC vote day, we may see a sudden and historic flip-flop that will then award "she who shall not be named" the presidency. Surprise! If this situation will so conveniently go away by getting it dismissed as "crackpots," will the opposite also hold true, and some 'magical' number shuffling and E.C. vote changing make a situation appear where there was none? We have all laughed and shook our heads at the tears and safety pins and safe places for those unhappy at how the election turned out. What if the shoe is put on OUR foot? And with the popular vote behind her, would it be so hard to fashion a "ha-ha, now who's crying?" scenario? The_Donald has supposedly now said he will not be following up on his prosecution efforts against Hillary...He, of course knows almost all the players in this game, to varying degrees of familiarity. As has been said elsewhere, his wits and background enabled him to retain a safe distance from all this horror rather than be just another participant.\nWe are hoping Donald Trump will be able to get something done. But he won't take office for another month and a half or so. By then, any credibility of this news will be entirely drowned by the MsM...\n
The crummy haircut does nothing to distract from the chin roll you got going there...Maybe wear the hoodie cinched right up under your bottom lip...
Happy belated Birthday.\nThank you for your reply. It truly sounds that while you suffer the condition, you seem to have a reasonable grasp on it. Which is not to say you have much, if any control over it, just that you appear to recognize the signs of it and their stimuli within your existence. That in itself is a good grounding to helping live with it. \nBravo on finding the strength to force yourself to do the 'outside' things you need to. Many cannot even summon that courage.\n\nI have cats, and at one time, was able to take them outside into the backyard. While some of them do not get along at all in the house, outside, they would be somewhat social with one another. I always joked that it was the wonderment of no ceiling that made them forget to not get along.\n\nIs your condition one of not liking ANY space not your immediate comfort zone of home? Or, is it only outdoors, where there is no ceiling? \nDoes your agoraphobia include discomfort around people? Or just spaces?\n\nOh, btw, marijuana is not a 'mellow panacea,' as many believe. It can cause paranoia, anxiety, and panic in some people. With your predisposition to anxiety, I'm not surprised it did not work for you. But that makes me wonder, do you drink herbal teas like Chamomile or Lavender? If so, do they help?
It is now, that is what plastic surgery is for...\n
That made me smile. Thank you!

Hello! Thank you all for your insights, tips and tricks, WITHOUT spoilers! After about a month, and 212 in game hours, I am still enjoying the game, now with the Wasteland Workshop add-on which has me turning Hangman's Alley into my own 'Vegas Strip,' without the casinos...lol!\n\nI am posting in this thread to say I HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION FOR THE SUPER MUTANTS AT THE LOCKPICKED ENTRANCE!!! \n\nI unlocked the door,  only to find out from this thread, too late, that I should not have done that. Codsworthless always leaves the door open, and they attack, shooting me as I come around the corner, and destroying the Heavy Machinegun Turret at the top of the Steel Doorway I built to replace the original...sigh...\n\nWasteland Workshop, for the low, low price of $5, fixed the issue for me. I tore out the cool steel doorway, and spiffy red door I had built, and placed a concrete floor block foundation (from the wood construction) on the ground, sticking up about 18 inches high (Seems most AI have difficulty stepping or jumping up small heights - something I discovered at Outpost Zimonja when I built an outpost above the concrete area of the old tower). \nI then put a basic wood slat wall across the entrance at the edge of the workspace parameter, and then put a Concrete Wall directly behind that. The top of the wood wall butts up against the extended window on the LH side, and the Concrete extends up about 8-10 inches high on the outer edge of that extended window (the reason for the wooden wall in front of it - To leave no gaps).\n\nUnsure of whether this would work, I left my twice-replaced Heavy Machinegun turret floating on top, although it now floats directly behind the concrete wall, about 6 inches below the top of the slab, and installed a shotgun turret on the edge of the concrete foundation block, in case the SMs did come thru the concrete wall - I read how they  could sometimes come through walls.\n\nIt seems the combination of 2 outer walls and the elevated foundation block are more than the AI can deal with. My last visit, I could hear one hell of a firefight on the other side - which usually culminated in them attacking through the open doorway, but NOTHING came thru, and Hangman's remained calm and productive.\n\nSo I wanted to share my success here, as I'm sure others will read this thread AFTER unlocking that damn door.\n\nNext play through, you can bet I WON'T unlock that door! 
I learn something new everyday, thanks to reddit. TY for that link!
Good Britney Spears cosplay, you just need an umbrella. Do you sing, too?
There is some sort of code conflict. I had both Cedric and Bill drown in those tanks, and always have at least 2-3 AI in the tank, treading water, or standing on a ladder I placed in there to try to save Cedric when he was drowning. Bethesda evidently has a bad AI Spawn point for that space that makes them spawn in the tank, instead of on land.\n
Wow...utterly brilliant. What else would be judged at a "mexican fart contest," besides smell? Musicality? Need to work on your roasting skills, M8. That was pathetically lame.
Best roast comment I've read in awhile. Kudos!
Grenade launchers. And I'd build them entrenchments at Plymouth Rock...
I read today of a poll of college people age 18-26 that gave Hillary a +28 point lead...SRSLY???\n
Interesting use of the present tense there. Presumably when people read that sentence what they ARE reading is the sentence 'you are reading weaponized text', and given that the text they're reading at that particular moment was produced by Russia's second favourite rapist, unusually Assange is telling the truth for once!
18 day old account.
Weaponized text is another name for propaganda. 
Along with "Fake news", "Alternative facts", etc.
Last I checked the the Eclipse_OW google drive file was still active. That was a month or so ago, so who knows if she's deleted it yet.
Might have been. I thought I head read the story much earlier, perhaps 2002-2005. I could be remembering wrong tho.
This is exactly my theory about Kelly-Anne Con-Job and the Bowling Green Massacre - she turned over two pages in her media packet and thought she was supposed to start talking about it before they'd actually carried it out. I suspect the Paris shambles with the guy pathetically trying to stab four armed cops in the mall underneath the Louvre was something they had to pull up the agenda to compensate (there were a LOT of reports in the news bringing up the ghost of Lee Rigby prior to that op, which I think were priming).
Wasn't Epstein pals with Trump as well? I seem to recall him saying something about how 'Like me, Jeffrey has an eye for the ladies, and they say he likes them young.' An interesting sentence to parse...
Regardless of the legalities or ethics it can't be denied that these look spooky AF 
My theory about this is that it's something somebody behind the scenes instructed Trump to say, precisely to generate this kind of fevered speculation. It's too neat - can be read as an allusion to fifth columns but also redolent of masonry, heck, you could even streeeeeetch it to argue he's alluding to ISIS infiltrating CIA because 'columns' is a synonym for 'pillars' and there are Five Pillars of Islam. It sounds pregnant with numinous content for those who have eyes to see, ears to hear and mouths to yadda yadda, but it's fundamentally meaningless. \n\nThink about the links between Russia and the Trump campaign. This is exactly the kind of bait Putin's Richelieu, Vladislav Surkov, would love to dangle, but I think it's bobbins. It's a red herring. 
Niiiiiice :)
I was wondering when the 1970s paedophilia stuff would merge with the Satanic Panic shite from back in the nineties... 
Jeffrey Epstein?
We might, if Julian Assange wasn't also in Putin's pocket. 
That's a nice Batman comic you've written in your head there. But that image...Trump and Epstein flying on the Lolita Express...that's very poetic.
And hella strong beer.
Bill Hicks killed Harambe
Most likely yes. I do performance art type stuff on occasion and I researched using blood for a piece - most uses of blood in performance art which doesn't involve actually cutting yourself or whatever are pig's blood, which is reasonably easy to source from butchers, usually chilled to kill off any germs etc. \n\nOne thing I do find funny is how ridiculously het up some conspiracy people get about performance art. Most of it is just about shocking people (Milo's frankly rather derivative piece definitely was), some of it is good, some of it has interesting ritual or shamanic elements but it isn't teh Satanoidz trying to work bad juju to bring about the New Birb Order. Anyone thinking that, in my opinion, needs to crack the books harder and revise their understanding of both art and magic, frankly.
And after less than two weeks of squatting in the White House like a collapsed sphincter dragging along the Oval Office carpet, he's off for his first vacation. Wow. What a mensch.
Why doesn't JA get off his ass and start releasing something? WL has been playing coy for too long now.
Your logic is literally some of the worst I have ever witnessed on the internet. Quite literally.  \n\nYou've assembled a string of thoughts into a timeline full of holes and misunderstanding but you're insisting that it's the only explanation. Despite many people in this thread politely pointing out holes in the concept and you reforming your argument to account for the glaring problems in your statements you instead hold fast to a terrible idea and name call those who have disagreed with you. \n\n"It's dumb" may be an accurate description of the actions your are referencing, but that doesn't change the reality of fact that murderers, rapists, and pedophiles all display the very behavior I'm suggesting. Yes, it was **dumb** John Wayne Gacy filled his basement with dead bodies. Yes, it was **dumb** Jeffrey Dahmer kept body parts in his fridge. Yes it was **dumb** Peter Truong kept 64 hours of rape video of his baby son on his home computer which he shared internationally with other pedos. These things happened and they are **dumb**. \n\nIf you're going to make this fantastic logic argument that *Officially Debunks* the video then you need to be able to account for the possibilities of the things I suggested with more reason than "it's dumb". It's *not* assuming too much to suggest he stored video on his personal gmail account, or on the phone he may have recorded it with, or shared it with other pedos, or intentionally posted the video himself. **ALL** of these things have been done by other pedos in the past and will probably happen in the future. \n\nIt's almost at the point in this conversation that I might think you are shilling, but your arguments are so astoundingly bad the only people you could be shilling for would be Trump in order to make CTR shills look bad. I don't think that's the case though because you probably really believe everything you are saying. \n\nWhat could you possibly do if we had this debate face to face?? I'm not sure there is much more you could bring to the table? 
I agree. I think the pattern we are seeing are arrests from the bottom up. As people lower on the totem pole get arrested they will plea bargain their way out of prison by turning in more high value targets if possible. I guarantee that someone of the hundreds they've already caught has some juicy details on higher level traffickers. 
I wonder when Trump or Bannon will start posting the decapitation videos? /s
I remember reading many years ago China had launched a new sub and the DoD didn't even know it had existed until it had been in the water for 30+ days. There was a huge freak out because it was considered (at the time) a massive failing of intelligence that no one knew it was even being built.
Nothing wrong with being pro-both, or anti-both. 
Then we would be calling him Clinton.
There is plenty of evidence of previous incidents in which most perps were not convicted or even charged. Roughly every 10-15 years (or so) something crops up to indicate DC insiders are involved in molesting minors/children.  \n\nAs recently as 2006, [5200 people on Pentagon payroll were caught purchasing child porn with government funds.](http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/01/05/pentagon_lagged_on_pursuing_porn_cases/)According to Anderson Cooper [9 of those caught had top secret security clearance.](https://youtu.be/o6W8H5Z0XAc) The issue was not initially considered "priority" by DoD until 2011 when Senator Grassley pursued the issue. As far as I know almost none of those caught have been revealed to the public, and certainly not publicly punished. The names of the 9 with TS clearance have not been revealed either. \n\nWhen you consider these people, in addition to those involved in the Call Boy Scandal of the early 90's and the Chicago based sex trades of the 1970-80's of which almost none were charged, there is a massive amount of people who have either committed or abetted sexual crimes against minors in Washington DC. Many (most?) are likely still working and living in the area.  \n\nIt is then reasonable to assume that many government employees (including politicians) involved in the purchase and trade of CP or the trafficking of minors for sex are still living and working in the DC area. Because of the Pizzagate investigations it's possible that those who have previously evaded punishment might finally be brought to justice.  \n\nThe cause is just.
I really wish the poop story was actually in the document. That truly would have been epic.
Last I heard he was supposed to be doing something with Google?
Well I think Alefantis is stupid enough and arrogant enough, yes. My suspicion about him is that he's a low man on the totem pole who got sloppy. He's too high profile now to go "missing" or commit suicide. Strangely, if he is indeed involved, Pizzagate is what's probably keeping him alive at this point.
No way... [not clicking *anything* on worldcorpo.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/creepypasta/images/0/07/Post-25055-NOPE-not-doing-that-gif-S3vn.gif/revision/latest?cb=20131215041923)
Its a video of a guy freaking out on a little girl who is clearly terrified of the man yelling at her. She appears to be behind a plexiglass wall which he appears to be hitting with a broom maybe? \n\nIt's toxic shit, and the girls pleas are clearly not acting. \n\nYou can find a link to it somewhere on Voat.
I originally came to reddit after the Digg fiasco but didn't bother creating an account for about 2 years because I really didn't feel like commenting. Even now I sometimes visit without bothering to log in if I just want to visit r/videos or r/pics.
Cool thanks! I'll have to check it out.
It's amazing to me that on a daily basis there is a stream of posts complaining this sub is full of T_D posters but yet I look at r/conspiracy/new and I see a regular stream of "Russians" posts, blatantly anti-Trump posts and posts complaining about this sub and Trump. \n\nSo then I go into the comments of posts *not* following the afore mentioned formats and see a stream of posts about Russians, posts complaining about the sub, complaining about pizzagate and posts relating this sub to T_D.  \n\nThe irony is breath taking.\n\nI'm really beginning to feel that much of the community of Reddit will not be happy unless this sub is a replica of r/news or r/politics. 
Lol! I love that you've equated them to the Orcs of Mordor! Have an upvote!
I'm curious if there is a way to see if there has been an up-tick since the Pizzagate pressure started. What I mean is there a way we could chart/graph the arrest frequency since 2015 or something?
It's important to compare the two against one another because in many cases Trump wouldn't be here, or taking actions he is, because of her. The Russian narrative is directly linked to HRC, much of the fallout currently in the middle east (and refugee crisis) is directly linked to HRC's State Dept actions. The DNC and Podesta bullcrap is directly linked to her, and on and on. As each of these topics comes up it's important to understand HRC's role in the debacle in order to illuminate properly Trumps approach whether you like him or hate him. \n\nFurther, as she continues to whine or gloat on Twitter (see her Flynn/Pizzagate tweet) she continues to insinuate herself in the political game.
What I mean by high profile is that he is the very epicentre of Pizzagate and every single CTheorist is watching the guy. If his breaks suddenly gave out on his car A LOT of people would start screaming foul play.
I'm all for this, even though the proposed investigation is just another blatant partisan attack designed to creat division in the population and try to keep Trump on the defensive.\n\nI really think he should just hand over the phone and say "here ya go!". If he is smart he wouldn't have anything compromising on it at all. If he's an absolute idiot he would repeat Hillary's fuck ups. If he's a genius he would "accidentally" leave compromising details about Democrats on it.\n\nEither way, it's a win-win for the people.
This same question should have been asked of Obama, Bush and to a slightly lesser extent Clinton. 
Sorry, not to be "that guy", but what ship off he coast are we talking about? This is the first I've heard about it. Can you give me something to google up or point me at an article?

Ask reddit
Lol, there was a sketchy image posted to 4chan... apparently Trump took a poop in the toilet, then after the poop he jumped around the room shouting "I hate black people!". It looked like a leegit clip from the dossier, and I admit I fell for it at first, but on research it turned out to be bullshit. Too bad, cus it sounded a legit as the rest of the dossier.
In one of the videos the child says "I'm just a girl..". In my opinion this isn't the kid in the video.
Well, the closest allegory we might have to an operation like this is the mafia. If someone is under extreme scrutiny (and possibly police observation) they aren't just going to whack the guy willy-nilly. And, if the mafia allegory holds true, once Alefantis becomes too dangerous he'll disappear, or when the dust settles and no one is watching any longer he will disappear. 
Nice!
No disrespect, but did you actually watch it? It's pretty clear there is humans moving around in that video. Sure it could be staged and sure the audio might be dubbed in, but the cries of that girl are pretty fuckin legit. If the whole thing turns out to be bogus I'll be happy it was a fake and eat shit for believing it. For now, all I have to run on is what I saw (partially) and heard, and that's enough for me.

I've tried to provide you some examples with documented evidence. My theory is, however, that most of these stories are intentionally white washed by tptb and their media lackies so finding really decent information is difficult. \n\n[Here is an article I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sietz/the_delta_project_the_foundations_of_modern_child/) about the Delta Project. A few of the sources I used are linked at the bottom. \n\nAs for the Franklin incident I know what you're talking about with the witnesses etc. More important is the connection to Craig J Spence. Google him and you will find a couple of articles related to the Call Boy Scandal before it was white washed.\n\nFinally, search this sub for Anderson Cooper videos and you will find the one where he discusses the 5000 child porn purchasers.\n\nAs for the clues you asked about, the same question could be asked about the Masons. They are the most famous secret group and their secret symbols are all over the dollar bill! \n\n*edit;sp*
Thanks for answering questions for me! Out of curiosity what language was the board you found it on? 
Well, it turns out this video surfaced 7 months ago on reddit, and OP [is answering questions about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u4qaf/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddsta2x/) in this thread!
I only watched the edited version on YouTube and that was more than enough for me.
> Show me\n\n[This thread started by u/anonymousgate](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jznpc/according_to_the_fbi_pedophilia_and_child_sex/) is a pretty good timeline of pedo busts since the 1970's. Many involved politicians who were never charged. \n\nDelta Project was a nation wide child sex trafficking ring busted by Dallas Police in 1972-3(?). Dallas PD found a card index of 30,000 names involved in the trafficking which they said involved many politicians in Washington. They sent the card index to the State Department, and for some odd reason State destroyed the entire file, thus losing the list of names for ever. \n\nThe Frankling incident showed clear ties to sex trafficking under age boys for orgies into Washington via Craig Spence. There is White House sign in logs showing Spence taking under age male prostitutes to the White House of midnight tours. Evidence showed politicians were using a crematorium to launder money to the prostitutes. The official investigation only looked at the financial mishandling and laundering, and not the under age sex or trafficking. \n\nIn 2006 5000+ government employees were caught purchasing child porn using government funds (likely purchasing cards in my opinion). Only 3600 were ever investigated, and as far as I know no charges had ever officially been laid. Anderson Cooper revealed during an interview that 9 of those caught had top secret Pentagon clearance. \n\nThose are just the cases I've looked closely at.  \n\nIn all three of the above cases those caught by police who were working in Washington could still be actively employed by the government.  Very few of the names have ever been revealed to the public.  \n\nThe evidence is clear that people in Washington like their sex young, and there is also evidence that elements of the government have worked to cover these incidents up.  \n\nThe news media have also showed clear signs of covering up the Washington incidents. Journalists would know the rumors and stories floating around the White House and they have failed the people by not investigating and reporting on the problem. For example, we know 100% that the BBC covered up Jimmy Saviles actions since the late 1960's, so it's not a leap of logic to assume American media does the same. In fact, the guy who currently runs the New York Times worked at the BBC for 25+ years and was a director there.  \n\nThere is a lot more evidence that nation wide trafficking rings involving politicians, media personalities and the wealthy have occurred and continue to occur to this day. \n\nWhat we've been stuck calling Pizzagate doesn't just revolve around Podesta, Clinton, and Alefantis... it involves hundreds of the elite who have been laughing about it behind our backs for at least 40+ years. Fortunately for us, Pizzagate may have found a weak link in the chain of silence and obfuscation.  \n\n*note; it seems like I keep writing the same argument over and over. I think I might just make a thread about this so I can short cut and link to that thread.*
Thanks you! I know there is a whole bunch I missed, lol they keep drifting in and out of my head as I work around the house! 
I'm at work, but Ill see what I can find for you later on.
It might matter. That's the best we have right now. Knocking him off would definitely signal he is a target of value. Leaving him alone puts PG8 investigators into the category of crazy conspiracy theorists. As I said, he's a sloppy idiot and if it weren't for all the attention PG8 has gotten him he probably would have "disappeared". Similar things have a frequency of happening to HRC's problem people.  \n  \n*edit* sp 
Fair enough, and "filtered" does make that easier. 
I want velocoraptors.\n\nAnd the cute ones with bumpy tails.... Those too.   \n\n*edit; and yes I know velocoraptors are the size of chickens... That's precicely why I want them... Deadly chicken sized killing machines... How awesome!*
I've never considered it this way. ^ This is an awesome explanation.
Personally I just assumed the meeting was formalized on a phone call. 
Interesting... Is this the first time Podesta has commented on the emails? \n\nConsidering HRC's Twitter comments the other day, and now this, it appears the DNC is changing tactics.
Who knows? I'm fed up with anons bulkshitting, so unless something explodes in the news I'll just ignore and move along for now.
Another very good point! There is possibly withheld emails, or maybe those could be some of the missing 30k? It could have been discussed in a conference call, or group meeting also.  \n\nI just don't think the missing replys concerning this meeting implies the meeting didn't happen. I think the missing replys is a stronger indication that discussions happened another way. 
He may not, but of the options in the previous election he was the most likely option. Time will tell if he is a failure, but I'm willing to give him a few more weeks to see what happens.
I've seen it too, but I couldn't remember the source. Even the DoJs reports lists 58,000 abducted by non-parents which is mind boggling.
If the founding fathers could actually see what was going on today I really think they would consult armed revolution. Their tolerance level was sooooo  much lower than ours is today.
The idea of "respect the office, not the man" has gone down the toilet.
I respectfully disagree. The massive blow-back on pizzagate is unprecedented when you compare it to c-theories like the JFK assassination, 9/11, moon landing, etc. That in itself is an indication to me that pizzagate seriously threatens *someone*, even if it isn't directly related to the PG8 main characters. For me, that's enough reason alone to continue looking at it.  \n\nAlso, we agree there is an elite Pedo ring. PG8 has moved so far beyond CPP, Alefantis, and the Podesta's at this point that we should really stop calling it pizzagate and instead call it Pedogate. Regardless, at this point it's unfortunate semantics we have to deal with. It's revealing massive government level failures in legal enforcement and has the potential to end the systemic molestation of minors in Washington. I'm ok being labeled a "crazy" if that is the end game. I'm also ok with ruining the careers of innumerable corrupt politicians if it means freeing as few as 1 child from sex trafficking.
Apparently 12:30 was an important time to watch. I discounted it as another anon post, but these tweets might confirm something interesting.
I think there is a lot of very old, very comfortable people trying to maintain power.  \n\nI think they grossly underestimated the power of the internet and social media, and now it's coming back to bite them in the bum.  \n\nI think in the past 6 months, with the help of Wikileaks, we've stumbled upon a weak link in the chain.  \n\nThey've realized their mistakes and now it's a race between them regaining control and us achieving enlightenment. \n\nThey have the money and the media, and we have words and numbers.  \n\nIt's going to be very interesting.
Here is a good few questions to ask;\n\n1) Do you believe there are politicians or officials in Washington DC who like child pornography, or practice pedophilia?\n2) Do you believe pedophilia is a crime?\n3) Do you believe any pedophiles in Washington DC currently accepting taxpayer money as payment for services should be held accountable equally under the law as other citizens?\n\nThen, send them to Voat.
Tbh, I sorta stopped following the story when the google thing was announced. No idea if he ever showed up at Yale or not. 
Thank you for quoting Jefferson :)
She began the Russian narrative back in the October debate with her 17 Intelligence agencies.
No it's definitely not proof, however we also can't assume that HRC restricted all of her State communications to email only. Apply Occams razor to this, and the fact that there is no other communication in the emails on this topic suggests it was discussed in person or over the phone, not that Hillary ignored the email and everything went away.

Dont forget [Marc Dutroux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux) where witnesses mysteriously died or went missing.\n\nAlso [Joris Demmink](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/14/fosu-pedophilia-should-be-zero-tolerance-crime/)
I'm going to reply to this statement instead [of your other reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddtiy74/) .  \n\nSome other failures you have made in logic in this thread is how the video made it onto the internet. \n\nAs 2 commenters pointed out, he fell for a phishing scan... on a GOOGLE account. Which means the Phishers also had access to his google-drive, which is a perfectly reasonable place to store a video. \n\nAnother option is that Podesta shared the video with others, and someone else leaked the video. CPorn makers frequently video and share the results with other pedo's as part of the power fantasy they live. Sharing the video and evading capture is a common behavior displayed by people like this. Please read the book [Hunting Humans](https://www.amazon.ca/Hunting-Humans-Modern-Multiple-Murderer/dp/0771050259) which details this behavior excellently with regards to serial killers. This behavior is found in both deviant types. \n\nA third option for the leak (both email and video) is Podesta's missing cell phone. If the video was recorded on his phone then anyone gaining access to the phone could very possibly found the video on the phone. It's not like Podesta was picking secure p@sswords. \n\nFinally, you haven't even considered Podesta posting this video himself to the internet, perhaps on a private dark web site or some such thing. Again, this is behavior displayed by many pedos. \n\nI'm sorry, but your logic is full of holes and so many people have pointed out the failings of your argument at this point that your statement that it's OFFICIALLY DEBUNKED is laughable.   \n\nJudging by your replies to others in this thread I assume you're probably going to call me ["a fucking retard"](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddtd19x/), ["shill"](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddsxti0/), [or the ever elegant "stupid"](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddt0weq/).  \n\nI look forward to your reply :)
Not unless someone actively filters it. 
The kiss was definitely inappropriate, but I think at 1:27 it was the kid popping his tongue out. 
*If* any are still alive, the odds of them speaking out are extremely remote until arrests happen. It's hard enough getting a child to speak out after daddy sticks a finger in their bum, can you imagine the difficulty if the child's and their family's lives were threatened?
I actually stumbled across news articles about this from 1976. I guess back then a bunch of states were legalizing it for cancer treatment, but I'm assuming between then and now opinions have changed. \n\nI've looked into it, and cyanide is a product of B17. The dosage is so low, and the liver is so efficient at filtering cyanide the recommended B17 dosage is perfectly safe to take. It's effectiveness is still up for debate, however.
The upper echelons of any criminal organization generally aren't the ones bragging or talking about their behavior in public. It's usually the lowest peons that do this.\n\nImho, the people posting the pics you are discussing are low level people who got sloppy and arrogant. I truly believe that if pedogate wasn't getting the attention it currently is, those low level people would likely "go missing" or "have an accident". However due to all the attention people like Alefantis are getting, the upper tiers can't simply eliminate the sloppy low level peeps without generating too much attention. 
Building 7 information is the easiest way to red-pill on 9/11.\n
I heard him on Joe Rogan and it sounds like he spends most of his time in Mexico and loves it. He smokes weed, drinks beer, and chills out. A pretty good life really, lol.\n\nHe did mention some bullshit with intelligence agents after winning the governorship, but I can't remember the specifics. It's in the Rogan podcast.
Agree. If I was 15 and a 19 year old Demi Moore was kissing me the most traumatic thing I would experience would be worrying about people spotting my raging boner. 
The problem with your argument is in the assumption Podesta knew the videomhad been posted to the internet. \n\nLets pretend for a second the video *is* actually Podesta;  \n\n1) He had been managing a presidential campaign that was fought tooth and nail the entire time. Would he have time to troll the internet seeking out videos that leaked without his knowledge?  \n\n2) Even if he was aware such a video leaked, would he be concerned about scrubbing it at all considering the male in the video isn't seen on camera?  \n\n3) The dems were 100%'certain they were going to win, so perhaps any scrubbing he was planning would be after an election victory when he had full intelligence services at his command. \n\n 4) After the email hack, how soon would he realize the data was going to be leaked through WL? He may have just thought it was a basic data breach for a couple of months. And even then, would he have considered people would have made the pedo connections? Would he have remembered any of the pedo emails still in his in box, and forgotten to delete?  \n\nI really **really** hope the video is a fake. But I don't think you have officially debunked it.
That's why you create an account and subscribe to subs you actually want to see content from, which then appears your front page. The "filtered" option is actually redundant if you think about it.
In a recent episode of The Unexplained podcast with Howard Hughes, Howard interviewed [Alexander Nekrassov](http://www.politicalscrapbook.co.uk/alexandernekrassov/) a former journalist and Kremlin advisor in the 1990's. He still provides source information to MSM news outlets. \n\nNekrassov maintained that the dossier was assembled in early 2016 for a fee of $130,000 (may have been pounds he was talking about). He said that the dossier was essentially a collection of Moscow rumors, and he had heard similar rumors about David Cameron, Tony Blaire, Obama and Angela Merkle. His summary of the dossier was that it was complete bullshit. He also mentioned that while it was true Christopher Steele had contacts in Moscow he said that those contacts hadn't been active politically since the early 1990's and should be considered dubious sources. \n\nPlease listen to his interview and form your own opinion though, because I'm probably missing all the interesting elements of the conversation.  \n******  \n*edit*; Interview begins at 53:15, Trump discussion begins at 56:00
Lol, they were absent when I posted that.
Voat has a few threads discussing this, so you should head over there to read up on a good pedigree of the video.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.   \n\nHow hard do you figure it's going to be down voted? I'm willing to gamble a 20% upvote range. 
Agreed, the number is a little mental, even at 2500. 2200(ish) are abducted by non-custodial parents and 332 by strangers. That's almost 1 per day! \n\nFurthermore, we need to consider the total number of children in a sex trade *not* reported missing. I've read enough reports by this point to realize that a *lot* of these children are put up for abuse by their own parents. 
Lol, times never change I guess...
How did you stumble on this?
There is a few people suspiciously absent from posting their regular gloating in this thread....

Whats the source on this info? The best I could find was FBI missing person statistics [like this one](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2014). These stats only show 332 abducted by strangers in 2014?\n\nI'm not dismissing the 800k number but I'm curious where it came from because I've seen it a lot and the difference between the numbers is so great it's got me wondering if we are citing accurate stats.
Agreed, there is only a blurby shadow guy moving around and the plexiglass distorts the girl, but the broom wasn't moving about using Windgardium Leviosa. \n\nRegardless, even if the audio is dubbed in, the sounds of the girl are real terror. If it's a dub, it had to be recorded somewhere.\n\nLet's hope I'm an asshole for believing it though. I really hope the whole thing is bullshit.
Well, I think it's important to remember China in this context because unlike Russia, China is *actually* threatening war. 
Oh! You caught me. I gotta go now though before mom calls!
As I said, Pizzagate is the name we are stuck with :/ I really wish it wasn't. I think part of the conspiracy is to keep it named Pizzagate so the herd discounts it and doesn't realize there is a pack of wolves in their midst.
LOL!!! Somehow I'm the dumb ass, but you're the one that thinks a child trafficking case takes 25 years.... *and* thinks the Clintons are the good guys. Nice one ;)
I'm not insinuating anything, however it's entirely possible. 
I think Milo is a douche, and his argument is fucking terrible, but at least he's published a clarification on his comments. He's addressed the issue.  \n\nThis is far FAR more than other who have been accused of these things. It would be nice to see published clarification of pizza hankerchiefs and fucked up instagrams.
What like a /b thread?
"What country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon & pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants."  \n\n- Thomas Jefferson, 1787  \n
It's nice to see all these people who would normally be spitting venom at each other working collectively (although not directly) towards a common goal. 
I do and I wish we could all move on from the HRC vs DJT quagmire. Unfortunately until certain factions in DC (both proTrump and antiTrump) stop creating discontent within the populace through division and animosity we're screwed. 
Imagine being a cop who has to see entire videos of this shit, and worse, as part of their job. They are bigger people than me.
"Mrs.Clinton... The Chinese want an informal, off the record discussion to discuss 2017 and discuss 'Chinese perspectives' over corn bread and chili!"  \n\n"The Chinese?

Unfortunately you guys can't see it (you are currently aware and not aware of everything, putting you in your position), I just hope it isn't because I can.\n\nthe pivotal crux (or cross- intersection of the material and etherial worlds/ real and abstract) is to be while not being at all, and to know the unknown while seeing all there is is both realized and unseen.  \n\nThus, MAHAT/ Intellect/ "The Great"/ Universal Mind is that of manifested omniscience (all that is science/ known... all that is object/ noun).

Yeah, and the KKK and WBC and fundie bible thumpers, and fundie terrorists and pedophile preists represent all of Christianity too. Turn off the Faux News and other lame--stream media.
So weight limit exceeded, or is this aftermarket?
Well the actual truth is, none of that matters. I am the universe, aware of myself, I couldn't tell you all truth to conspiracies or the Illuminati's secrets, because it doesn't matter, it's this experience we are all constantly doing that defines all we are. All. Everything. The key is to constantly continue to wrong yourself, limitless is real, it's us.

> There was a period of time in which Islam was peaceful, progressive and brought about great technological and sociological change to the world. Unfortunately, thanks to the mix of salafism and meddling geopolitics it's very difficult to consider Islam as progressive in this day and age. \n\nIt still generally is, but there are indeed extremeists that are generally shunned by most Muslims and are generally funded/armed/created by the west on this geo-political chess board.\n\nMost religious people take the good and leave the bad, however, there are global elites fucking shit up for everybody and funding this shit. There are anti-humanist aspects in the holy books of the three big religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism), but most people take the good and leave the bad.
Muhammed was a pedophile, a thief and a mass murderer. Muslims see him as the perfect human. \n\nThat is facts.\n\nDon't be blind and ignorant, and see what islam really is: the worship of all that is seen as evil and sick. \n\nLook at any muslim nation and you will see the same evil. \n\nIslam is cancer.  
Yes but it is really wierd. I can see how everyone can't see it. It's like I'm in the Truman Show. I used to bawl my eyes out every night facing new crazy realisations. Now I can't cry. I want to sometimes. My mind is now far to aware. It went from thinking more and more to not at all. I don't have to think.. about what.. I figured it out. But of course saying that and being here means I am not 'there,' but I will be. I will still be present, I can't be limitless if I want to save the world, that's being something. I have very little to go, I wanna say I can feel the universe aligning. It's like this is it. I'm not wrong, wrong doesn't exist anymore, for me nothing does, it's so fucking wierd.\n

im not sure I know what you mean
We might be defining extremism differently, IMO anyone who kills in the name of their god is an extremist. I can accept that you might view that differently. \n\nHe started a war with Mecca. \n\nHe beheaded almost the entire male population of the Qurayza. \n\n>Not his fault people like you and ISIS have bastardized his teachings \n\nSeriously, the man started wars and beheaded people but *I'm* ISIS?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand *why* he did lots of these things, I'm just not naive enough to call him peaceful or particularly moral. He didn't mind killing people if it benefited him. \n\nThere was a period of time in which Islam was peaceful, progressive and brought about great technological and sociological change to the world. Unfortunately, thanks to the mix of salafism and meddling geopolitics it's very difficult to consider Islam as progressive in this day and age. 
Cool, sorry but I feel much more sorry for you(not being able to show you what is it you are experiencing). I am not relating myself to anything. I told you I am nothing but me finally. Sorry I can't help you. The only thing you had was that yes, I still have no benefits from being all this, so suicide will be my end currently, but nothing exists for me anymore. You don't understand why you are denying me, why you decided to deny me, you will reach a point you can't pass, I have concieved it all. Yet I still haven't got to experience why I do this, tell you.. because as you just showed me that you are going to die, there is no hope for anyone. Only that contradicts what I've experienced, this I have yet to figure out, can someone else also be here with me.\n\nEdit: other thought: We're the 'application' it's all us. You have to be here to understand what was just there.
It's so damn good. He announced a couple months ago that he's putting a new album out this year. Can't wait to see all the topics he covers!
Any luck? My facebook stalking skills are terrible so I wasn't able to find him...
Just watch the beginning. It's islamic propaganda. 
Listen to his The Cause of Death - Immortal Technique. He exposes 9/11, the Bush administration, the CIA, etc.
I predominantly listen to classic rock; Led Zeppelin, Doobie Brothers etc\n\nImmortal Technique does an amazing job. Straightforward lyrics, simple beat, not overproduced, absolutely gets the message across. 
[deleted]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, defending a pedophile and a low life murderer, classic muslim. \n\nMuhammed was a disgusting pedophile that married a 6 year old and raped her when she was 9 years old. \n\nYou're too brainwashed by propaganda to see that.\n\nMaybe you should read about Muhammad's life before spewing fake news about him.\n\n
His best work is this one here, the number of times I've played this poem are countless, mainly because of how absolutely TRUE it is.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bURgTLHryrg
> I still have no benefits from being all this, so suicide will be my end currently, but nothing exists for me anymore.\n\nHey man- I misunderstood where you were coming from.  I'm not denying you.\n\nYou're missing beauty and experience.  Go find someone who loves you (parent, sibling, friend, mentor, child, whoever) and hug them and tell them what you told me.  \n\nI wish you the best.  You can still have a positive impact on other people's lives through living and giving.
Remember, you are atoms, so is everything else. When you feel emotions, it's just a delayed experience  that you barely understand. The universe is one(happening at once in time, because being aware creates time), so thinking and thinking and thinking just means no more thinking. I'm not aware of everything in the universe. I am the universe. Nothing is in the universe. We are all there is. Just because you are here on earth in your position.. it's impossible to discredit anything or verify anything. We are one. I am you. The difference you feel is that experience happening that doesn't quite make sense yet for whatever stupid fucking reason.\n
Strong. Went through Immortal Technique some times ago, need to go through all of it it seems. Thanks
Islamist propaganda bullshit. The "prophet" was a murderer and a pedophile. Islam is for sick people.
Check out Ab-Soul. Has a song on YT called Pineal Gland And each of his albums has a few conspiracy themed songs. Pretty good stuff
>Maybe you should read about Muhammad's life before spewing fake news about him.\n\nI have. \n\nHis cult survived because of religious extremism and a willingness to commit mass murder. Lets not pretend he was a nice guy.

>are generally funded/armed/created by the west on this geo-political chess board\n\nIt's the Saudi's to blame for most of it, they export salafism nearly as much as they export oil. The west certainly has a fair share of the blame when it comes to training and arming many of these groups though (or even just creating the power vaccum that allows them to rise. \n\n>There are anti-humanist aspects in the holy books of the three big religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism), but most people take the good and leave the bad.\n\nI don't disagree with that but I do think its more complicated. Not everyones opinions on whats good are the same and when it comes to fundamentalist or highly conservative religious movements they will almost always become hostile to outsiders. Not necessarily violent, but hostile. \n\nAt this point in time Islam seems to be suffering from widespread fundamentalism or conservativism. Far more so than the others in the big three. 
Been listening to Immortal Tech for years now! Dudes lyrics have always been eye opening. Dance with the Devil is a song of his I'll never forget. 
Totally worth it. 
I predominantly listed to death metal and some black metal, but I also love Immortal Technique and other rappers, and the underground.
Experience.., rappers call it luck or destiny when they rise, but they only just got to think about it the whole time. They never had control. Because there are a lot of humans, a lot of experience. It's irrelevant to say anything should work any other way. This is the universe functioning, deception is everywhere. We get to experience time because we get to constantly be aware. It's very very simple. World Peace would be a side effect.
Thanks, good song. Honestly everything k rino raps about is real and many users here would find value in it. I recommend antagonistic radio, fuel to the fire, exposing the motive, flawed technology, so grateful, making enemies, grand deception
Immortal Technique is such a good writer. I'm a classically trained musician and I could listen to his work all day. 
I listen to Cause Of Death nearly every day!
Awesome song. Haven't heard that in a long time! Glad someone remembers it!
Don't capture that phrase. I only said that because of you. I feel immortal. I am the savior, I can help everyone. I will always be able to wrong you. I am the wrongest person ever. 
If you like immortal technique you have to check out k rino
I was being tongue in cheek.  I was writing absolute bullshit.  What I was saying isn't WRONG, but it has zero value without application.  It's gobblygishgookgallup.  If you just sit there thinking about it, you're going to be miserable and sink further and further into brain chemistry issues.  Any schizophrenic person can tell you these "truths", but maintaining a concrete thought or process is too difficult for them to be considered functioning.\n\nIt's all well and good to be philosophical, and even use that as basis or rationale to not learn concrete principals or facts, if that's the choice.  Be an ascetic.  Join a cult.  Do yoga all day.  Whatever.  But stewing in esoteric independent meanderings while living in society is an impossibility.  It's a recipe for substance abuse issues, too much digital, and mental illness.
o man that is a long time ago i listen to real rap instead of that mainstream crap TY !

so what. bush was the director of the CIA no? because he was ex KGB that makes him a "baddie"?
they asked the U.S to assist and got no answer. again the U.S taking credit for doing nothing 
molten aluminum is silver.
just to note, almost every attack in the US or EU was known before hand but not intercepted. i mean why stop them if letting it happen increases funding and powers within intelligence community 
you work for CTR keep talking shit lmao
you really have to pick? one side floods EU with refugees alot of which are muslim. thanks to the constant wars for Israel. no israel. no problem. but it might be too late anyway. the middle east wasn't a problem until Israel showed up and started to destabilize the region
oh. right. because you call them rebels and not terrorists. well russia will shit on them all the same. 
whats under the jacket? shes holding it up with the bag
Obama is just playing his part, the Iran deal was done so Iran wont give the hardware needed for Syria to defend itself from ISIS Air support the U.S will be supplying. Iran would need to think about escalating it now. meanwhile Obama publicly tries to distance himself from his puppet master in Israel to keep up appearances that he is commander and chief. and not just a puppet. 
That's incredible!\nHonestly though, a 12/12 on turn 1 as a rogue. You've just used up all your luck for the rest of the season. 
personally i think the people that rigged the WTCs all gathered in building 7 to oversee them coming down and to be debriefed. then building 7 got pulled with them in it. nice clean operation with very few loose ends. anyone left after that had something to gain so will keep it shut
the way the bodies lay on the ground so close to one another and the direction they all faced makes it look like they all died in seconds trying to flee from something. like some chemical or biological weapon
i never said anything about nukes, the deal was done so Iran would need to think before supplying Syria with anti air weapons. since the U.S is now supplying air support for "rebels" in their fight against Assad and ISIS. so obama makes it look like he was going against Israel with the deal when this was all part of the plan.
its not a war on drugs. its a war on competition.
supposedly the most radioactive place in Manhattan is around the Israeli embassy. food for thought
"declassified" propaganda. its just serves to prop up the official story of hijackers and whatnot 
conduits of which Zionist money flows to terrorist organizations. to further justify expanding their global intelligence network and wars in the middle east to destroy Israels neighbors 
they need to thin the herd a bit. too much cattle can be an issue when they can potentially start to fuck shit up. and for all we know it could be way more focused and not just random, like going after dissidents and other problematic people. who knows 
you still have zero evidence of Russian troops in Ukraine, so feel free to spout bullshit.
probably losing sleep from the fear of getting killed by her handlers. a lot of powerful people paid good money for to win and she fucked it up. now she risks implicating them and others with the leaks. 
if they made GMOs that are for our benefit then why not label products that contain GMOs? Monsanto is one of the only company's in the world that dose not want you to know you consume their products. not to mention all the money they pay out to people to shill for them
they sprayed bug bombs on passenger airlines that recycle air, as a standard procedure for every flight
you need to remember that if it was all a hoax it would be harder to pull off than messing with the shooters head until he breaks. not to mention the operational security would be terrible and would have incriminating information leaking out one way or another.
slap on the wrist for getting caught.
so it is about sterilization... 
how much do they pay you. your comment history is a joke 
gotta keep the prisons full somehow right?\n
they literally just pump chemical and nuclear waste into the ground along with water and sand and then siphon off the gas released from the reaction. 
they've been using drugs as weapons for a long time
its the only patch of government held territory for hundreds of miles. they held out for over a year. then not an hour after the US bombs the position ISIS rolls in to try mop up 
without Hamas you wouldn't have an excuse to continue the constant genocide. that's why Israel collects taxes from the Palestinian people and gives it back to Hamas. Muslims are Semites too, making Israel the biggest antisemite around. with the biggest concentration camp in existence  
tens of thousands? id like to see some proof for an accusation like that. meanwhile U.S funded ISIS are chopping heads of people left and right 
one thing to note about that is everyone reaction when he shot him. its like this happens every day. completely unphased as they witness an execution 
if you ever needed proof AJ is controlled. just wait a few months and see the kind of shit trump does. hes kissing his ass and it will backfire for him
didn't the Jade helm map have soCal marked as an "insurgent" pocket. i think something just backfired in a big way..\n\nthe map\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Helm_15_conspiracy_theories#/media/File:Jade_helm_15.jpeg

flamanville "A fire resulting in a minor explosion broke out in the turbine hall on the non-nuclear part of unit one at the Flamanville nuclear power plant,"\n\nnoticing a lot of articles popping up saying its of Russian origin. nothing to back that up yet, maybe they are trying to deflect attention away from the actual incident in france\n\n
ZOG in Germany let it happen because its good for the cause of Israel. its the only reason these attacks happen in the first place, to gather the public support in destroying Israels neighbors and Palestine by collectively demonizing all Muslims 
it was the same day the DNS servers got hit with a major sustained ddos attack. could of prevented his deadman switch. not seen him alive since. all news reports about him since then used old footage. including RT
i think the events are real to the extent that shooters killed people. as for seeing people in news clips in multiple events? it could be a psychological operation since for the most part we pay attention and would notice multiple people showing up in multiple events in the news. its so we would start overthinking it. when all they have done is interview the same people that might even be part of the news crew staff behind the camera. 
Monsanto is already messing with strains. how hard would it be for them to introduce it into circulation? we would never know
connected to those incidents at plants in France? two separate explosions in two different sites. 
honestly, i recall them starting to show up after we posted here talking about how creepy he is around senators kids. and they have become more and more frequent as we got closer to election.
i think with US troops lined across the Russian border they could spark off a war covertly and the NATO troops along with the US will react into a full blown war without trump being able to do anything to deescalate in time before nukes start getting thrown around eastern Europe. NATO and Russia will be face to face and on high alert it would take anything to set it off
noticing alot of imgur posts about Biden during the elections. i think they have a plan for him since they keep trying to endear him to us. its been ramping up quite a bit
Monsanto have a pretty big reddit presence. you say anything they don't like and you get down voted into oblivion
and AJ is trying to say anything about comet pingpong is a distraction. total bullshit its one of the best cases for prosecution with mountains of evidence. hes trying to deflect 
they didn't get who they wanted. but what does it matter when they control all the pieces on the board. trump just wants in their circle. that's why hes always walked around putting up that inverted pyramid hand gesture that they all do.
seriously messed up that they can still sell seafood from out the gulf with all those chemicals being mixed with the oil on the sea bed. you couldn't pay me to eat those shrimp. that shit will give you cancer
if wikileaks is compromised then this could be a way to try cover their asses on the way out the door
it doubles as an owls head
well erdogan was never going to go along with the plan b in Syria. Israel and the U.S/NATO are going to fully support the Kurds now and he wont let that happen while hes around.

he also made millions of the war in Vietnam through bell helicopters\n\nBell helicopter rival Kaman Aircraft signed a contract for the procurement of 220 helicopters bound for Vietnam that was submitted and approved by Congress in 1963. However within days of LBJ becoming President, the contract was nullified and re-awarded to Bell Helicopter. The US involvement in Vietnam was escalated, and Bell thrived. The Johnsons owned considerable stock in Bell and had used the company for transportation in his barnstorming of Texas in 1948. "Within five days after the assassination of President Kennedy and the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson to the Presidency, the program for procuring UH-2s from Kaman was dropped by the Department of Defense,"
since when have the US or UK governments ever taken any petition seriously? they just straight out ignore petitions if and when it suits them.

Hey there! I was into the whole trading card/steam level hype for awhile so let me help!\n\nCertain games on the Steam store drop cards just for playing them. These games show that on the store page. Games that drop cards have badges. A set of cards for a game can range from 5-15 cards and the game will only drop you about half. Leaving you to purchase or trade for the rest of them. After you have acquired all cards that the game will drop for you, you become eligible for booster packs for that game which are given to you randomly. Higher Steam level = higher chance. \n\nCards are different from CSGO items. Although CSGO does have cards, it also has a built in item drop system in the form of crates and weapon skins. Thes are earned in game and have nothing to do with cards or badges although they can be sold for high value. Crates that are dropped in game require a key to open (bought for around $3 and they are not dropped in game). Crates hold weapon skins varying from common to Legendary but the chance of getting an expensive one is slim and not worth the money. Its usually cheaper to just buy the skin you want directly from the market.\n\nThe "cheapest" way to earn badges is to craft cheap badges and acquire all the badges steam gives out for free by meeting the requirements. Selling cards nets you a small "profit" depending on what you paid for the game. During Steam sales you can get a bundle of games for $2 or under that are usually bad, but have card drops. Also getting free games is a good way to get cards for money. There are subreddits dedicated to giving out free games or locating them. \n\nGems, as mentioned are pretty useless. 95% of the time its better to just sell your cards/backrounds/emojis but I break that rule sometimes if I have a lot of items worth 3 cents and know I'll have enough gems to craft a pack.\n\nIf you have any other questions let me know, sorry for the wall of text I'm at work ;)
Alright, you convinced me to try it. 
Sad but true. \n\n"wow this is such a great LPT I'll remember it forever". Then u promptly forget it until I see it again the next day and am amazed all over again. I got in the habit of saving interesting posts but now there's to many of those to look through too. 
It home to one of the original NORAD bases in North America. It's still patrolled by police. \n\nOne day my ex and I biked up to the entrance of it, it looked deserted and no one was around. We poked around the fence and came to a little hut with a phone on it and a camera. After trying to open the door, the phone rang. I picked it up and it was the police telling us to leave.

tyty friend. I had bought a sticker and applied it to my weapon but wasn't sure if that was the extent of it or what. Appreciate it!
I was 6, my sister was 4. My dad had brought us out to a cottage for a few days and thought that watching a scary movie would be fun. Turns out he had never seen it, and lucky for us he only had part 1 on VHS. My sister is scared of clowns to this day. 
FTL has a special place in my heart. I love that game, cannot recommend it enough!

Got it as well :) ty friend.\nAlso it has trading cards!\n\nEdit: Usually $40? Hot damn
I'm late to the party but here is my 2 pennies worth. \n\nFrom an outside perspective it's hard to tell the tone your bf used to acknowledge that you're not so great at video games. If you think he was deliberately rude then mention that too him. As a guy that's been gaming my whole life, trying to get my girlfriend into was never east either, although I'd never tell her she sucked at them unless we were joking around. \n\nAlso remember that being a gamer doesn't mean you have to play certain games. When my girlfriend tried getting into gaming she played a lot of games she didn't like before finding her niche. She didn't enjoy the GTA series, or any shooter games. Instead she spends her time avidly swimming through the world of Abzu or farming on Stardew Valley. She uses games to relax and take her mind off the day, not stressing over not reacting fast enough or anything of that nature. \n\nIf you want to be a gamer, only play games you enjoy! It may take some trial and error but you'll soon learn the styles of games you love. Maybe dark souls isn't your thing, maybe it is. You have to decide that for yourself. 
Definitely one of the most informative videos I've watched on cs:go

People would rather beg for new operations 
It really is hard to gauge what the right sensitivity is. During matches do you find yourself over or under shooting? As in, if you have an enemy on the left and you turn towards them, does the mouse end up past them, on them or Infront of them? This is a good indicator to check if it's to high or low for you as a player. 
I am level 26 with 110 games in my library (not sure how many are badge eligible). I find that I rarely get drops, whats the fastest thing I can do to get more boosters? As I understand it you need a level 1 badge to be eligible for the booster in the first place.
Damn I remember playing this game in highschool with my good pals! I check it out every once and awhile but it never seems to get updates
Have you seen this subreddit ever? \n\nWe bitch about the meta, we bitch about new cards, we bitch about the release, we bitch about the meta, we bitch about new cards, we make some demands, we bitch some more.\n\nI realize that Hearthstone can improve in a lot of area's but it feels like this whole subreddit has nothing good to say about it anymore. 
The same time my GF told me that women were hitting on me when I had no idea.
The Economist, propriété de Rothschild justement (ça peut aider).
I think the reason there was a lot of sleeper cards us because Team 5 is an expansion or two ahead of us. \n\nPro players will rate the new expansion cards based on the current meta, how the cards affect it, and how similar cards in the past made an impact. Team 5 is making the next expansion with the next next expansion in mind as well. Sure there will be some underwhelming cards, but maybe they will only remain that way until they capitalize on it using future expansions.

Jokes on you, I'm not married and I'm still never right. 
It should just come up above the Buy option. It shows historic Low and Current Low. Needs to be in browser of course.
Just started playing recently as well thanks to the winter sale! Such an amazing game. I get sucked in for hours at a time, completely ignoring the main story to do side quests and explore all I can. Love it. 
Hyper Light Drifter is an amazing game, I cannot stress that enough! It has a lot of content, the combat is challenging but so so rewarding. The art style is beautiful as well. One of my friends recommended this to me and I love it. \n\nYou could also try Dungeons of the Endless. It is another game that is a little harder to play in the sense that you are not overpowered or anything. Very fair combat and fun to play
Can't tell if actually in Brampton or just reaching 
Honestly man.\n\nThis subreddit complains about being treated like children, that they need more credit than that because we are all knowledgeable individuals (el giggle). Then an announcement comes out that is well written and informative but no one reads it fully, the same question gets asked/answered multiple times. It's a little ridiculous. 
I look forward to your monthly reviews as a recently new subscriber to the humble monthly bundles. \n\nI couldn't agree more on your description of Husk. At first it seemed pretty atmospheric, the train sequence had me a little on edge and for a time I was looking forward to playing more. Then you end up walking around the town and the experience goes downhill. The framerate stutters, the main character talks to himself a little too much for my liking. The monsters seem a little bland, and the combat was not very fluid or intuitive. \nIts one of those games that sucks you in but fails to keep you there after the main gameplay sets in, I'd have loved for it to be better than it is. 
Because someone that loved developing games made it in the hopes of people falling in love with it. That's why it's Indie.

I think mobile phones is also a big reason why Hearthstone seems to be stuck in a rut. IIRC it was mentioned that they had to scrape some ideas because they could not figure out how to make it work properly on mobile. Having Hearthstone playable on phones is one of the reasons it took of so quickly, and its an edge it has over other CCG's that are out on the market now. The downside is that it holds back just how much they can accomplish now. Duelyst and other games don't suffer from this problem and are free to expand as much as they want without worrying about being limited by hardware. \n\nAlthough having Hearthstone on mobile was a huge selling point to the casual fan base, it stops the rest of the game from growing into what it could be competitively. Maybe they can make the mobile platforms a casual only experience and have competitive be PC only so that they can work more with it.
Noticed that as well and thought it was clever 
Yupp same here. I find that right when I start games for the first time, or close them after not getting a card for awhile I'll get one.
I have't personally played ES myself, but I have gotten into Endless Legend and Dungeons of the Endless lately due to the steam sales. Love the games so far.
Canada computers is a very solid option 
You don't HAVE to dust some old cards. But doomsayer is one of those cards that is fairly unique, so having to replace him with something else is not very beneficial. By all means try some other tech choices that are suggested if you are wary of dusting some cards. 
Thanks, got it! 
Definitely play in order of release. I loved Bioshock 1&2, I played them both entirely at least twice. After playing Infinite though, I could not go back to them. I find the game play so much better, the environment is bright and beautiful. It's hard to go back to rapture after that. 
Yupp, I was thinking the same thing!
I wish I could! Looking forward to Deadbolt and N++. 
He is worth the 400/800 dust man. No other card can clear the whole board as efficiently for 2 mana. Not only that but he makes the opponent more often than not skip their turn if they can't remove it, giving you board initiative.\n\nYou may be able to find a replacement but it won't be nearly as useful.  
A moment of silence for those poor souls. RIP

I think the game you are looking for is called Abandon Ship. Check it on steam. 
Billy Talent opening for Guns N' Rose's. \n\nParadise City is one of my favorite songs so I was fangirling pretty hard. Goddamn what a memorable time that was. I was there with my girlfriend, my sister and her bf, and my parents. The whole stadium eas drinking and smoking weed. 
My god do I have a story for you. \n\nI see a lot of men talking about preferring busty women and falling for one that isn't busty, that's weak. This tale goes deeper than that. \n\nI'm a white 22M Stoner. While attending college (I'm a recent graduate) I happened across a coop that dropped me into a Government job. That didn't stop me from toking before work. I put in good work but was that kinda guy that would also have twitch/YouTube open all the time on my browser. I read Manga, spend a good time playing League and other games, just the all around average college kid. \n\nShe was a second gen African 24F University student, never tried a drug in her life. She was actually writing her Thesis on the impact of curly hair in the work place. Very incredible woman, always so lively and energetic. Vegetarian (sometimes), attended live poetry, had the Starbucks App, you know that kind of woman.\n\nI never would have seen myself with someone like her at all. Two totally different kinds of people. One day she had one of her friends ask if I was single. A few days later we went out for a vegetarian meal, my first! Everything she said was so engaging and interesting. I hung off every word that came across her lips. Speaking of which, her lips were one of her many gorgeous features, my god it was as if the God of love had materialized in front of me. I feel so hard. \n\nOf course this was all a few days before the end of my coop. After another day or two of talking we decided I'd spend the night at her place before I left. After work we left together and spent the night drinking at a board game cafe. I didn't even know those things existed let alone been to one. We retired the night at her place. Putting on a movie and laying in bed together. We spent the whole night talking about her Thesis, she went into great detail and I loved every second of it. I don't think ever had anyone genuinely be interested in it. 7:30am comes around and we leave for my last day of work. Busy day so I kiss her goodbye before I go home. Never seen her since. 
You just have to expand your range of online stores to purchase from. \n\nSteam did offer very competitive prices during the winter sale on SOME games like Stardew Valley, which hit it's historic low of $11 IIRC. So they aren't totally out of the runnings. \n\nCheck out other places like greenmangaming or Gog or any number of the bundle stores. Sometimes they beat Steams price, and the games are activated on steam so it's a win win.\n\nLast time I went to a physical game shop I laughed at the shallowness of the pc game pool, not to mention the prices. I wouldn't buy off Amazon because I'd rather have a digital copy that I can play instantly. 
I'd love as much as anyone else to have my collection available to me across all servers. Although NA is my main, I've met lots of people through twitch/reddit that I can't play with because they are on a different region.\n\nThe only thing is how big of a nightmare it would be to implement this. Not only do you need global servers connecting people from all across the globe (I can already imagine connection issues becoming even worse). They also have to compensate players that have near full collections on both. \n\nKnowing this subreddit the backlash would be unreal. 
got one just now\n
Links lead nowhere\nEdit: They are working now, problem most likely on my end since I am at work
Modern warfare 2 comes to mind. 
Sheridan colleges Davis campus is almost famous for it's international students programs. As a white male I'm a minority, but I loved that school. 
It was just recently updated actually! No new features just a few bugfixes iirc
So STB can be a 3/1 on turn 2 due to rogue hero power, fiery war axe, jade claws (or whatever) but spirit claws can't be a 3 attack on turn 2 due to a spell power roll? Not sure I see the sense in that. 
mmmff girl you are something special ;P Let me treat you right\n

There are lots. A bundle just for Dungeon of the Endless, a whole bundle including Dungeon of the Endless, Endless Space and Endless Legend. 
I'm 22 and I'm the same way. \n\nJust over Christmas I bought $50+ in games, Dying light, Starbound, Stardew Valley, goat simulator amoung others. I've played dying light but rushed the story so I could play something else. Haven't even opened Stardew Valley or Starbound. \n\nBut you can bet your ass I've been playing Csgo religiously still, or league. No matter what games I love the idea of or want to play, my favorites always remain top priority no long how long it's been. Kinda sucks but I hope I'll get through my backlog.

I loved The Swapper so much! Definitely worth it. \nStacking wasn't bad, played for a few hours but never beat it. It offers a lot of content and puzzles though. Really great idea behind it.
Some of Codemasters games (Dirt 3, Grid) are no longer available to purchase so they are giving out free keys iirc
Fuck Yes.\n\nA lot of people are not fans of this game compared to the rest of the series but man I loved this game. Reminded me a bit of the flatout series. \n\nNot sure if I should be sad that Codemaster is giving away all its games for free, I'd hate to see them stop making games.
As a man I'm fairly sure we just like knowing the measurements of things....or appendages lol.\nBut I have spent close to an hour shopping around for the perfect mouse, its gotta feel proper if you'll be gaming heavily on it!

Where do you go ingame to make these predictions? I thought you had to buy stickers and I'm so confused >.> Haven't picked up CSGO in months until a few weeks ago
Said every war game ever. 
But then how will I update my drivers every two days? /s
I know what you're talking about but I hardly act on it. \nRecently I purchased dishonored 2, and reinstalled the first one thinking I'd play it over again to get back into it, but I haven't yet. Part of me wants to go back and play it but part of me doesn't wanna waste the time beating it again, and prolonging the time it takes for me to play the second one. I also find that I remember enough about the previous run through that I'm not as motivated to finish playing the game over again. 
Have a nice shower, don't wear to many layers down there or else you'll start to sweat.\n\n Also, I found eating fruit makes the jazz taste better. 
Damn you are all kinds of gorgeous. I can't get enough. 
Subreddit complains about being treated like idiots when it comes to hearthstone, turns out subreddit is actually full of idiots that cant read a full article or do math. Hearthstone knows their target audience
I use Idlemaster. Read somewhere today about ASF for the first time so I tried it and could not tell if it was working or not :/ Did the basic steam username/password/authentication and the terminal said the game was running but i did not see any progress or any indication it was working.
Thank you for the generosity! Had I more money I'd love to be able to do the same. 
You can add me if you want, Le_moise or LeMoise (cant remember rn and I'm at work). I play CSGO, Rocket League and a bunch of other games thanks to steam sales. Level 30, collects free games for trading cards and badges
Pumped up kicks. 
Both are 1 mana, 1/3 damage on turn two depending on draw. 
The fact that this has to even be said is sad in the first place. This is a sub reddit where people come together to find and provide free games to the community, why is there any hate going around at all?

Why can't you point out the importance of the topic you presented without shitting on pizzagate?
lol :)
No it's not. There's no substance to his argument, no backing up of his claims. At one point he says "It's a lie". Says who? What proof does he have? He surely isn'tpresenting anything concrete for how whole-heartedly he's denying this to be true. The entire segment is filled with unsupported claims. The whole basement thing, Alefantis mentioned storing cans of tomatoes in the basement in an interview a few years ago but now suddenly there are none? What? He continues to quote the same media who told everyone that hillary had a 97% chance of winning. And for the record, I did not vote for Trump. I was a Bernie supported who bailed on the DNC for Stein.  the same way they bailed on him and us. 
In this AP article that tries very hard to make it sound like there is absolute proof of Russian activity, there is one sentence around the fourth paragraph that states that "clappers testimony... Was short of concrete evidence of Russian activity". One sentence. The entire rest of the article reads like that sentence didn't exist. \n\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/article/2760ab8835494a7190df91fe718a644a/top-us-intelligence-officials-testify-russian-hacking

No I wouldn't. But did his comment really do anything to prove either sides argument one way or another? Or did it just attempt to belittle and muddle the conversation?
I agree with you and that story was quite nice. However, another thing to consider is in 5-10 years they'll be old enough to compete and will likely be relentless when we're old and slow the the new games. Think about how hard it will be when we're in our 60s ( I know that isn't 5-10 years but at the rate tech is improving its hard to gauge) and playing VR games that require full body movement against limber and agile youths who have no problem wiping the floor with us. \n\n
Id bet good money this post was deleted from whatever political subreddit it was posted to. 
That's been since 2000 right? I remember a snow day Valentine's Day as well. 
You types? Are you assuming I'm republican or right leaning? If you would have read my original comment, you'd see I clearly stated I voted for stein after bernie got burned by the DNC. As for the "riddle" it's not a riddle at all. It's actually a Podesta email. It's also one of the reasons I refuse to brush this idea aside. Because it makes no sense. Dominos being played on pizza or lasagna makes no sense, so why would John ask about it? \n\nIf any of you, who so vehemently deny this theory in its entirety and continue to attack me for not denying it, had actually done any research of this topic on your own, you would know that.  Instead, you just blindly demand others for proof and gladly accept what the talking heads like Colbert tell you "is a lie". There are plenty of other confusing words and phrases used in emails that are part of the reason why I refuse to dismiss this unlike most of you. In fact, If anyone could tell me why the owner of one pizza place is listed as being one of the 50 most powerful people in DC, I will gladly give gold to everyone in this thread. 
I would imagine so. Many people in varying industries don't begin with SC degrees, but instead start out at the ground floor, like in a warehouse staff position or as a driver or something and then gain knowledge and experience and work there way up. The degree in that situation would certainly help the rate of promotion and help raise the the height of the promotions. 
Made me really sad when I saw this. Was a long time viewer of the Report, and I managed to stomach every episode of TLS until I saw this one. Haven't turned back sense. The alignment of narrative between news, late night talk shows, and shows like SNL has been amazing. Friends of mine have noticed it too but don't understand that it's intentional. Crazy times. 
The same type of militarization that causes people to downvote anyone who questions him. Just scroll down past ass kissing and you'll start to see that anyone who was not 100% supportive of him was downvoted immediately.  
Here's the difference in our questions: yours is made up and a pretty bad failure at being funny. Mine is actually from a Podesta email. 
Nice misdirect to you too sir/ ma'am. Would you care to tell me if it's better to play dominos on pizza or pasta?
The dipshit that originally tweeted this is white. Tf is going on 
Just look at the top post and the comments on it. Defending Biden, arguing about topics that have been commonly accepted here for months. This seemed to have happen really quickly right after the allegations dropped last night. 
"That's not how much we actually spent on a bailout, it's how much the U.S. and the Federal Reserve (which isn't the U.S. Government) committed in loans that were paid back and mostly overnight"\n\n...so who owns the Fed? 
Still haven't gotten a ticket nor do I know how to get one?
Tell that to Podesta. He's the one that asked it in an email. You'd know that if you did any research on your own instead of just believing what the media tells you. 
Bah oui, maintenant qu'il y a Trump c'est de bon ton de le dire. Et quand est ce que les états-nations sortent de leur servitude vis-à-vis de Bruxelles ?
I've never been able to purchase Left for dead 2 from the store. Granted I only check when there's a special on it, but it seems that Xbox might think it's a part of a bundle but the bundle doesn't exist so it results in an error
Then he tried to deny it on his show by saying "she couldn't afford him". Like dude, it's literally in emails. What are you trying to deny?
But the biggest part for me was that without an internship, I wasn't getting offers for the dollar amount I wanted. I took a job making $10,000 a year less than I was expecting to after graduating. 
The Saudis funded the federal government long before a Trump was elected. 
Likely because he is the polar opposite of the Prez-elect. The same media now using him to increase the divisiveness between trump supporters and democrats is the same one that colluded against him with the party he was running for. 
Agreed, but why is there no reward for it? I've noticed it's harder to get rewarded for killing a Titan, I've probably crush landed three while playing and don't recall any sort of reward. 
It's not like we were better off with the other option. She didn't think a private email server could be hacked. And yet here we are. 
I believe this was Aldous Huxley's perspective. I can't find it now but I recall reading either a comparison of Orwell and Huxley or Huxley's opinion on Orwell, but the main difference was that according to Huxley, we would seek to procure the very devices that would provide the means to monitor us. Which is exactly what has/ is happening. 
Asking a question?!? How dare you!! Downvotes because I hate that you'd even question him!
Entry level telecom jobs and many data entry jobs will also higher with just a degree. 
The irony that this was posted to Reddit. 
But he doesn't deny it. He just misdirects. 
Serious question: where are the stars?
Or better yet, get him an iPod and fill it with every song that came out the year he was born. 
Memorial Day is for deceased soldiers while Veterans Day includes the living?
Not arguing that, nor was I even sure that what I said was correct. Just kinda made sense in my head. 
I know it's a day old but over 38,000 upvotes and I had to go to pg2 to see this. 
Pick me!
Okay, but I asked the question to determine how the fed pays it? Where does the Feds money come from?
Just because one is lying does not mean it is impossible for the other to lie. 
I've got a double honey comb and the way it's designed it's nearly impossible to get clean between the two. I've also had a few little particles floating between them that don't seem like they'll ever come out 
This Eric Church half time show is a lot better on mute. 
I couldn't agree more. I just about idolized him on the report. But this election cycle has really changed my entire perspective. The way he but Bernie on the back burner, then charged full steam ahead for Hillary  really made the show hard to watch. I've seen every episode since he took over but after this election, and especially this segment, it shows that he's no better than any MSM talking head. 
He's not the only one. Obama, Hillary, the federal government in general has been taking money from them from quite some time. It's just two sides of the same faced coin. 
You don't necessarily need an internship to get SC. There are warehouse type jobs or other part time jobs that you could get that would get you involved in logistics, warehousing, forecasting, and other parts of SC and could end up providing you with good resume material. 
Graduated in May but former studENT. Different fraternities are full of them, I know mine was. It's definitely a little taboo there but I knew plenty of people that were about it. 
The last post I was on had a comment mentioning Dennis Reynolds and Golden God. Probably enough reddit for the day. 
They could just not discuss it. 
Because the media (both news and entertainment like talk shows, SNL, etc.) told everyone pizzagate was an "alt-right nut job Internet conspiracy" while pissgate is still being treated like its real. 
Yeah but look at how the top pgate related post is being brigaded. Just came from the comments, it's abundantly clear that commenters are coming here with the intention to shit on anything related to it. 
Whenever I try to explain to my girlfriend my perspective on these sorts of things, she gets furious with me and says that "I'm so negative and depressing and how could I stand myself living in a world that I view as so negative?" What she doesn't understand is that my view only aims to seek the the truth. I have no expectation for that truth to be "positive" or "happy", and so when my perspective seems "negative", it isn't a reflection of my views but rather a reflection of our world. \n\nWhen I told her that, I could tell something clicked, but she is certainly one of those people who chooses to ignore the things of which we at R/conspiracy discuss, because it would make her outlook" too negative and too difficult to live with"- which I view the opposite. I feel that the pain is how we know we're alive, and that the fact that my resulting world view is negative means that the world must be a painful place and it's our responsibility to be aware of it and maybe someday do something about it. \n\nWithout having spoilers, the whole pain makes us know we're alive thing is heavily represented in west world- which sort of made me realize all of the things I've just explained. 
Unnecssary downvotes for questioning hillary. Seems typical for reddit. Preemptive bring on the downvotes 
I knew about them when I saw them last time they were at Roo, but I didn't consider myself a fan. I'm glad I ended up seeing them though, I became a big fan of theirs afterwards  
This happened awhile ago. I know her brother pretty well, though he doesn't like to talk about it he made it seem like she was just a naive college girl trying to make money and be popular. Not really a conspiracy, just a girl who's never been in trouble and didn't think there would be consequences for her actions. 
Bernie Sanders. 
Would like to see this
Can confirm. Came from a middle class family, attended a public university in Texas, now working my ass off (barely making anything) and living at home to pay off over $80,000 in college loans. And I finished in four years and had a little assistance my freshman year. 
I didn't spend $80,000 on a degree. I spent about $60,000 and the rest is interest. The ROI is low now because I had no experience when I graduated and decided to take the first job offer I received so I could start making money to pay off said loans. I chose my degree based off what I was told by the university- that major was very lucrative and affected every company. 
Well, we ended up with Hillary after the DNC colluded with her to get her nominated over Bernie, who was shown to be the better candidate to beat Trump. 
Just heard this in the documentary "From JFK to 9/11: Everything is a rich mans trick" pretty good doc so far, Id recommend checking it out. Would link but I'm on mobile. 
Dallas?
Check and make sure the kids are okay
There's no indication that the entire financial system has become completely toxic for the vast majority of citizens? Not one? Not all of the recent college grads stuck with crippling debt? 
Ah, what Bernie Sanders wanted to do. If only the people could have seen through the DNCs collusion and voted for the guy who would have fought for that. 
Dope for sure, but can't help but feel for that bear. 
It's not that they argue against it, it's that CNN or HuffBlow or theSkimm or any other MSM source talks about it. So they are unaware of it. And in the age of instant access to info, the mindset becomes "I've never seen/heard about it so it must not be true". The opposite can be said about "pissgate". It might not be true (likely isn't) but people have heard about it so now they're much more likely to believe it. 
Why are you here
If you do, start with his oldest stuff and move forward. People who only look at his recent works really miss out on what I think is what defined him as a musician. 
But then how can we buy stuff? /s?
Yep, welcome to Twitter in general. 
You'll likely get suspended and make the news though. 
I couldn't make it past that episode. I still try not to think about it. 
Spit out my water reading that one. 
All you can do is keep looking. It might freak you out that your friends are already giving them just don't give up. The more interviews you go on, the more experience you get. Just don't give up on looking, you will likely regret graduating without an internship, I know I did. 
I bought a Pavilion in 2012. First laptop I ever bought, needed it for college. By the end of the first year, the bottom of the screen part cracked. Not the screen itself, but the hardware surrounding it. Turns out they didn't put a support bar between the two hinges that open and shut it, causing too much weight to be applied on every open and close. Of course the issue didn't arise until after the year warranty. My only options were to sell for scraps or buy a replacement for about the price of the computer. It's sad because I really liked the computer but the fact that they knowingly let that design flaw hit the market killed their reputation with me. 
I think that if a game will only feature online play with no offline story or other high quality content, then I shouldn't have to pay the same price for it as I would a game that has all of it. For example, Titanfall 2 has a great multiplayer and a campaign( which I have not played) but the fact that it's there makes it seem much more worth $60 than, let's say SWB which at release only had 4-6 maps, and lackluster offline options (survival mode and "training" games". That game to me seemed worth $30-40, especially considering the fact that the extra content was at least an additional $20. 
Oh yeah you can. Im almost positive it happened to me on one of my first play throughs. Got too excited and stood under the icon jumping and suddenly wham. 
It's kinda weird that Gerald Broflovski in South Park claimed to be looking at piss porn when Sheila caught him. South Park is creepily accurate 
Im ready to start replying with"if you're only here to try and shoot down conspiracies, why are you here?"  Because other than being paid to, I don't understand why someone would spend their time trying to shoot down an idea like this. 
And you still never answered whether it's better to play dominos on pasta or pizza. If I knew that, Id have no reason to think any of this is real. 
I play campaigns every now and then and there's people on. Haven't tried multiplayer. Hopefully the current sale increases user numbers. 
Watch the Kroll Show. Throughout its three seasons, they do this prank show and it's hilarious imo
A loaded question? How would you prefer it to be asked? Wait let me guess, probably not at all. Just have the comment deleted and the user shadowbanned. 
Yeah the big problem with reddit and most news/social media platforms is anyone who isn't republican (right leaning) believes they are receiving unbiased news because what's going on in the political sphere is already so crazy to them that anything the MSM pushes off on them is believed because "we're in an unparalleled part of history where a mysoginistic racist homophobe businessman" is in charge. The problem is that the same people living in this bubble don't realize that the exact same type of people have been in charge for years and years. 
Where can I see the rest? Really wanted to see how the guy who asked the questions responded. 
I did, but not in supply chain. Well, I'm in a year and a half long rotational program where I'm supposed to do six months in "supply chain" but it's really more just inventory management- like a warehouse job. I likely won't even rotate and will remain in construction. 
More upvotes than the other two top comments by a few thousand but have to scroll all the way down here to see it. Hmm...
That's already every episode the last two seasons. 
Just curios, $1100 a month for a house in burbs would be north or south of dallas? Like arlington direction or lewisville direction 
Do you have a clip of this?
What event are they at
Started 0-6. Climbed up to a four way tie at 5-6. Need two wins and need one person to lose at least once and the guy I play this week to lose this week and next. 
It says that it's been added to my EA account but I'm not sure that I even have an EA account. How do I get this?
Redditor since three weeks ago. Only two comments were today. 
Okay but student debt isn't the only financial issue in our country. 
It's not a riddle but an email from Podesta. But I see why you'd think its a riddle because it makes no sense at face value. The fact that it can't be explained is a part of the reason why I refuse to dismiss this theory. 
If you're so convinced it's fake, answer this. Is it better to play dominos on pizza or lasagna? If this question doesn't make 100% sense to you, then you have no right to so confidently brush this issue aside. 
Just heard this mentioned on ABC
Let me take a guess based on some recent remakes: it'll be two female wedding crashers. Maybe Anna Kendrick and a butt double paired up with Amy Schumer. 
Oui, mais de toute façon il faut une très forte volonté politique, une compréhension de l'économie et commencer par vouloir remettre en question l'UE/L'euro, et alors là c'est le tombeau du PS.\n\nCa n'enlève rien au fait que qq qui normalise ce genre de chose... n'est pas forcément préférable à celui qui prétend se battre contre (quoi que des fois...).
> Je ne vois pas en quoi ils seraient victime de publicité mensongère macronienne pour l'instant.\n\nC'est exact, c'est éventuellement pire. Ils ont trouvé un personnage aux dents blanches, dynamique, optimiste auquel ils peuvent s'abandonner. Le capitalisme libre-échangiste de l'UE et du CETA, les banques (notamment de Rothschild, une des familles les plus puissantes du monde qui a par exemple contribué à [la création d'Israel](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9claration_Balfour_de_1917)), le MEDEF etc. vont améliorer leur situation.\n\nIls le savent mais ils croient.\n
L'Union Européenne est une zone de libre échange poussé/créé par les [gros industriels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GizWAkMddsg) et la [CIA](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/) (comme Jean Monnet), il est logique que cette zone s'étende et que ses créateurs décident des modalités.\n\n\n> Un Anneau pour les gouverner tous\n\n> Un Anneau pour les trouver\n\n> Un Anneau pour les amener tous,\n\n> Et dans les ténèbres les lier\n\n
C'est exactement ce que je dis. C'est juste qu'on est au stade la boucle est bouclée, "la main qui donne est au dessus de celle qui reçoit" et maintenant ils prennent directement le contrôle politique plutôt que de l'influencer.

C'est marrant mais tes TINA et baisser le SMIC c'est pas des gros poncifs du grand patronat ?\n\n> ~~Poncifs ~~ problème macro-économique : l'Europe et les banquiers qu empêchent la France de créer de l'argent, les taux bas qui viennent faire je ne sais quoi ici, Rotschild avec allusion à Israël juste pour le fun...\n\nC'est juste un exemple parmi d'autres qui démontre leur niveau de puissance. J'aurai  pu citer la guerre de Waterloo où ils ont financé et parié à la fois contre Napoléon et contre la coalition en face.\n\n> Raccourcis sur la privatisation : les aéroports sont toujours à nous et pas de bol pour Alstom, Macron est le seul à avoir émis des doutes en public contre l'avis du gouvernement.\n\nUne privatisation c'est l'ouverture du capital. [Alstom...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnGH9v-oIA), ohhh il est mignon d'émettre des doutes \n\n\n>  baisse de charges maximales sur le SMIC, \n\n=> plus de SMICards et tjrs pas spécialement de création d'emplois (et les salaires des uns sont les salaires des autres, alors en compressant les salaires tu vas entrainer les autres). Il va falloir descendre au niveau du SMIC république tchèque à 330 €.\n\n> pénaliser le recours récurrent au CDD\n\nC'est déjà le cas, c'est juste que l'état fait pas son boulot.\n\n>  plafonner les indemnités licenciement, mettre en place des négociations à un niveau plus fin et repenser notre système de représentation syndicale. Tu rajoute de la formation aux chomeurs financés par tous et on est bien.\n\nTout ca sont des clopinettes qui ne sont totalement négligeable par rapport aux problèmes d'Euro, de libre-échange, travailleurs détachés, d'évasion fiscale etc.\n\n> Pour information, la santé c'est financé par des impôts, plus par des cotisations, c'était le cas avant. \n\nOn est dans un mode hybride je crois.\n\n> soit tu as l'argent, soit tu l'empruntes, j'aime bien ton coté capitaliste mais faut arrêter de demander au marché de financer nos dépenses de fonctionnement.\n\nFaux. Un État devrait avoir le pouvoir de battre monnaie, nous ne sommes plus un État à cause de Maastricht. Les marchés financiers peuvent juste aller se faire voir et spéculer ailleurs. C'est sûr que quand on se fait soi même une clé de bras et qu'on essaye de faire ses lacets sans remettre en cause ce problème, on a du mal.\n
> c'est un énarque, un ancien de Rotschild, et il était au gouvernement Hollande, c'est pas un secret hein.\n\nCe n'est pas un secret donc l'étape logique d'après ce serait de le traiter comme tel, un envoyé des banques, du MEDEF et du capitalisme mondialisé. J'espère juste que tu ne t'imagines pas être de "gauche" en mettant ce masque de l'anti-système tendance écolo-culturel que tend Macron (à ceux qui ont voté Hollande notamment).\n\n>  je suis pour la loi travail\n\nC'est ton droit, comme 20% je crois de la population qui veulent l'inversion des normes pour "négocier" plus facilement avec son patron (ce qui implique la dégradation globale de l'environnement de la branche dans laquelle bosse ta boite avec la concurrence vers le moins disant - tu négocieras ton taux de majoration pour tes heures sup' en tête à tête avec ton patron - ou juste imposé - c'est déjà ce qui se passe), le licenciement "économique" décorrélé de la rentabilité de ta boite, un dédommagement plafonné pour licenciement abusif et j'en passe.\n\n> privatiser l'industrie française\n\nC'est ce qu'il fait  : aéroports (Nice, Lyon, Toulouse), Alstom aux américains, le réseau de transport électricité RTE (ca je le sais personnellement de mon père, il voulait juste le vendre au plus offrant), etc. l'Union Européenne nous force à tout privatiser, barrage électrique, réseau électrique, réseau ferroviaire, etc. il va pas se priver, ça va être un carnage\n\n>  Notre société a fait le choix du chômage de masse, \n\nFaudrait pas remettre ca en cause plutôt ??\n\nCe n'est pas en présurant tjrs plus les salariés que tu vas y arriver en tout cas (rapport à la loi El Komhri), d'autant plus qu'il y a déjà beaucoup de possibilité en France en terme de précarisation : boite d'intérim, CDD, etc. Nous sommes confrontés à des problèmes macro-économique, comme le libre-échange dans l'UE (bonne chance avec la Slovaquie), un Euro beaucoup trop fort pour nos exportations, l'endettement de l'état incapable de créer son propre argent (Maastricht article 104 devenu 123 dans le traité de Lisbonne),  la baisse tendanciel du taux de profit (le capitalisme qui se mord la queue), la baisse de la demande, et ainsi de suite.\n\n> autant faire payer son coût à tous ceux qui paient des impôts, pas aux travailleurs.\n\nLa Sécu ce n'est pas un coût, c'est du salaire socialisé, c'est un système révolutionnaire qui dit que la valeur ajoutée produite peut échapper au capital et à l'état en allant dans des caisses dédiées géré en partie par des salariés qui s'organisent et payent d'autres membres de la société : ceux des retraités, des chômeurs et bien sûr de tout ce qui concerne la santé.\nTu veux moins d'état ? Alors il faut garder la Sécu, au moins la santé n'est pas soumis à la seule logique de rentabilité et échappe à l'état et à la spéculation capitaliste, c'est tout leur soucis d'ailleurs (comme ce bon vieux Fillon qui s'est fait payé par Axa pour ouvrir ce gros "marché"). Je ne veux pas donner plus d'impôt à l'état, c'est un système pourri, l'état fait ce qu'il veut, et l'impôt est une taxe sur le capital, ce qui dit symboliquement qu'on est obligé de "voler" le capital pour le redistribuer (alors que ce n'est certainement pas le capital seul qui produit).\n\nSi tu ne veux pas faire "payer" aux travailleurs des choses, il s'agirait d'être cohérent et d'éviter de les précariser et de les mettre en concurrence avec des pays qui ont un SMIC à 330 €. 
Who is this guy, how come he is so popular? The vid has been uploaded yesterday it has subtitles in 13 languages!
Nop. Let's just judge people NOW who never took part in anything on the behalf of what others have done centuries ago, because they share the same skin color!\n\nNo it makes perfect sense that's why I think, as a french, we should kill all the german because their grand grand parents invaded us, and that's why I think we should kill all the muslims. I hear you! It's very convenient. Let's not heal the wounds, let's make random people pay the price.
I guess it is still a problem, I'm saying maybe there is another view point, and that's what your book says. \n\n> In the era of colorblindness, it is no longer socially permissible to use race, explicitly, as a justification for discrimination, exclusion, and social contempt.  Yet, as legal star Michelle Alexander reveals, today it is perfectly legal to discriminate against convicted criminals in nearly all the ways that it was once legal to discriminate against African Americans.\n\nAlright, so obviously people don't want to deal with criminals but maybe it is being used as an excuse to target black people whatsoever - and this is racism. However I think we can agree that in a competition based system, people will discriminate on everything they want, obviously including criminal past (although pot related activities for me is not a crime).\n\nNow the question is: how do people end up committing crime? Is it related to racism or is it related to social-economic environment, like being born in a poor familiy, in a ghetto, with gun/violence/pot being regular business and being promotted on TV by people you can relate (Snoop Dogg, whatever), dropping out of school like many of your friends do, no job opportunity in your neighborhood etc.?\n\nSo to fix the problem, I recommend helping people, which maybe most of them appear to be black, to raise from poverty, drug and violence to self sufficience/independance. This is how you may really fix the problem rather  than unmasking/calling people racist, which may be true, but is somehow ineffective.\n
> pratiqué par des non-juifs. [...] extension du judaïsme.\n\nEuh ? Va falloir expliquer par qui c'est pratiqué du coup. C'est un [courant du judaïsme](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohaisme).

Bon bah maintenant dites moi, statistiquement, où se trouve Macron le pro-CETA ?
Tiré [d'ici](https://latetehaute.fr/histoire-de-marin):\n\n>  Is viennent à peine de s’assoir quand un des individus, armé d’une béquille, ouvre la porte arrière, cherche Marin et lui assène un premier coup sur le crâne. Le choc est tellement violent qu’il projette Marin en avant dans les bras de Clémentine. Il perd connaissance et convulse immédiatement. Du sang sort de ses oreilles. L’agresseur continue néanmoins à frapper. Les passagers sidérés font ouvrir la porte au conducteur pour repousser l’agresseur. \n\nWTF. Le gars se prend un coup tellement violent que le sang pisse de ses oreilles et ils continuent à frapper ? Putain c'est triste. J'aimerai garder foi en tout être humain mais j'ai du mal parfois à réprimer des bouffées de haine. Qui sont ces gens ?

Aussi creux qu'un discours de Macron, belle performance, c'est du Franck LePage dans le texte (programme langue de bois bien sûr).\n\n> Il est difficile de régler les problèmes avec le même état d’esprit qui les a créés disait Albert Einstein.\n\nCommençons par faire place neuve, quand est ce qu'on met les banquiers en prison ?
Je suis d'accord.\n\nEn fait ce qui me dérange c'est vraiment le couplage entre diffusion et "vérification". Chacun peut tenter de vérifier, etc. Par contre, "réduire la circulation" comme il l'appelle, c'est de la censure (au max il pourrait proposer un lien vers des sites de debunkers qui se sont attaqués à l'article diffusé ou rappeler les bonnes méthodes pour exercer son esprit critique etc).
Comme je viens de te le rappeler une élection sans contre pouvoir est une farce (et certainement par la démocratie). Les électeurs ne sont pas responsables car ils signent un chèque en blanc, les élus leur mentent et se sont associés à la [Goldman Sachs](http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/le-scan-eco/decryptage/2015/09/07/29002-20150907ARTFIG00257-comment-la-grece-a-maquille-ses-comptes-publics-depuis-1997.php) pour truquer leur compte. Donc, non, ils ne sont pas responsables et pour info il y a eu un vote pour rejetter les propositions de la troika que les [élus ont trahi](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9f%C3%A9rendum_grec_de_2015).\n\nIls n'ont aucun pouvoir et ce sont bien sûr des victimes, ceux qui se font couper en 4 leurs retraite ou qui se suicident, tu vas me dire qu'ils sont pas victimes que c'est eux qui gère mal le pays ? Ça me débecte.\n\n
> Monnet (et les autres) ont utilisé cet argent pour faire ce qu'ils voulaient, favorisant notamment les syndicats et la collaboration entre les peuples au détriment du patronat, \n\nAlors j'aimerai bien savoir s'il faisait tout ce qu'il voulait avec cet argent, ça m'étonnerait fort car il suffit de déplaire trop pour se voir couper ses financements, la main qui donne est au dessus de celle qui reçoit. Monnet poussait par ailleurs l'idée des États-Unis d'Europe, bref fédéralisme. C'est tjrs utile d'avoir des forces "à gauche" qui poussent dans la mm direction, mm si c'est un poil différent, ça amène l'agenda sur la table et ils pousseront de toute leur force niveau capitalistes pour rediriger au bout.\n\n> Donc nous sommes d'accord sur le fait que Jean Monnet n'a jamais été un agent de la CIA.

La vraie menace pour Macron c'est si les gens finissent par se sortir la tête du c*l en réalisant que c'est un énarque soutenu par Rothschild, Alain Minc (qui veut plus d'Union Européenne et supprimer le "référendum" au nom de la Paix [voir à 8 minutes](https://youtu.be/oorQD8dWY7Y?t=8m20s)), partage le bilan de F. Hollande, veut te faire un El Komhri 2, continuez à privatiser le patrimoine industriel français pour le plus offrant, faire sauter le principe de la Sécu pour en faire un simple impôt. Mais vu la gueule de r/france, je suis inquiet.\n\nÀ force de pousser des  "antisystèmes" (énarque-banquier-proche MEDEF-européiste-présent dans toute la presse, soutenu jusqu'à il y a peu par Attali -  qui a depuis retourné sa veste - proche conseiller des dirigeants du système qui nous enterre depuis 40 ans - etc.), on va juste se taper MLP.

Oula le démenti est énorme. C'est comme quand ils ont couvert les révélations de Wikileaks qui a duré des mois pendant la présidentielle américaine et qui a été repris à chaque fois par les Trump et qui a certainement conduit à la défaite d'Hillary ! Ah en fait non, ils ont rien couvert du tout, par contre ils ont écrit un article en se demandant si [Assange était une marionette du Kremlin](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/140816/julian-assange-trop-proche-de-la-russie-de-poutine?onglet=full).\n\nMediapart sont des euro-atlantistes.

Tu es banquier popo ?\n\nLes banques francaises comme le reste ne sont pas du tout assurées en cas de crise systémique, qui de toute façon se produira par effet de contagion comme pour les subprimes.

Alright, I did not know the 13th amendment, is it used though? In France we had a law until recently who still forbidded women from wearing anything but skirts... Jim Crow laws have been abolished 55 years ago. I agree Prison Slavery is just insane.\n\n> White people are still benefiting from chattel slavery\n\nThis is your legacy and you can't do much about it. Anyone living in america (not only white people) and some private fortune are benefitting from those. I'm not sure what you can do about it, transfer wealth from some people that iinherited it to other that suffer from it.\n\nThe "NOW" issue is to stop Prison Slavery alright this is unacceptable. But also to get rid of criminality (and thus enhance education, jobs, whatever) to fix the root of the problem, that's my point even though some blame should be taken.\n
Exactement, il faudrait sanctionner tout ceux qui le font et j'imagine que les USA finissent pas loin de la première place. Ils pourraient accroître les contrôles et disqualifier des athlètes pas un pays entier, c'est n'importe quoi, et s'il y a des sportifs clean chez eux ?\nCe genre de décision est politique avant tout.
C'est l'excuse utilisée pour supprimer la politique à travers le mondialisme sans remettre en cause le capitalisme - au contraire. Une incohérence tellement forte et pourtant... c'est à déprimer.
Tu as des sources ? Hilter avait un projet pan-européen ambiance "Das Neue Europa" et était farouchement anti-communiste. Après y a Walter Hallstein qui a participé à l'UE mais bon c'est léger, je connais pas bien le sujet. Le but est tjrs d'assurer le capital face au mouvement sociaux, c'est ce que fait l'UE.

Iran is fine, it stands on Islam but it fights terrorism.\n\nWe have way bigger problem. Yep, I believe there is a biblical prophecy taking place along w/ other stuff (battle for money, oil, geopolitical stuff). Some rabbis themselves say it. Israel hasn't been made in any part of the world, they are accomplishing and living the "book". 
WHOUA et Pourquoi pas Les Bilderbergs, Illuminati, Trilatérale, Rotschilds, Israel, Et les reptiliens, et la Banque Centrale elle est dirigé par Goldman Sachs AUssi?!\n\n/s
Ce qui m'importe c'est de commencer par dire la vérité et Polony n'est pas d'extrême droite, c'est une caricature ou tout simplement une calomnie.
Je n'ai jamais prétendu être exhaustif, il est clair que parmi les plus grandes force en revanche la CECA est l'embryon de l'UE mais les initiateurs de "l'Europe" sont multiples.\n\nPour la fable "les américains ont sauvé l'Europe des nazis" et les USA ont voulu une Europe pour la Paix, c'est juste du bullshit. Il suffit de comparer les pertes US et URSS. Par ailleurs, les américains continuent d'ailleurs d'envoyer leur GIs partout pour leurs intérêts économiques ou autres en prétendant le faire au nom des Droits de l'Homme, peu de choses semblent avoir changé.\n\n
> Can you clarify your allusion regarding Israel?\n\nI'm not well versed in religion, zionism and all, I have just came accross several people being zionist or analysis from christian etc. that say they are on a messianic, self-fulfilling prophecy. And the book states that several wars and catastrophies must happen (so they will make it happen) for the prophecy to come true - can't remember exactly what is, maybe the "chosen people" reunited in Israel ruling as a nation of priest on others gentiles (which is why some say that Vatican 2 happened to break catholic church, but they have a problem w/ Islam because there is no central authority) . This is atrociously vicious, comitting massive war, crimes etc. so that their happy end eventually come, fanatism at its best.\n\nI am illitterate regarding what you say about Palestinians, Iran etc. they obviously are being put on pressure, embargo, massacred or threatened by israelis and their USA/NATO puppet, so I'm not sure what they can read from this. Where does it say that an Islamic civil war must take place? This is being engineered to me, every difference is used to divide and conquer your ennemy.\n\nWhere are they drilling exactly? Is this supposed to be the exact area for the temple?
On peut savoir de quel complot tu parles ?

I'm french, so I'm not well versed in america's law. It seems this is segregation. Well, see my other comment, as a french should we blame current people for their grand grand parents who invaded us once they were nazi? No. This are not the same people, they share the burden. You can blame other people and its consequence but it has limits. Let's find a way and heal the wound together and have peace.

EDIT: Ah visiblement il faut avoir bosser au moins 2 ans, système de merde en effet.\n\n> Donc la seule solution pour faciliter l'embauche des jeunes sans diplôme [...] c'est soit de baisser le SMIC, soit de baisser les charges patronales sur le SMIC (c'est ça que Macron veut faire).\n\nAh un bon gros TINA. Je viens de te donner pleins de facteur macro-économique et toi c'est baisser les charges sur le SMIC (ce qui est déjà le cas) ou baisser le SMIC.\n\n>  Faudrait savoir, moi je veux bien payer plus d'impôt pour le chômage des autres, pour leur santé et leur retraite. Pas toi selon ce que je lis.\n\nTu réponds à côté. Tu sais quoi, il suffirait que l'état veuille prendre dans ses impôts pour aider la Sécu en prenant à sa charge par exemple la rénovation d'hopitaux pour que ton problème soit réglé sans défoncer la Sécu.\n\nBref...
>  Plutôt que de cracher sur Macron (ce qui ne marche pas, ça ne fait qu’enorgueillir ses soutiens),\n\nDéjà, je fais ce que je veux.

Je vais te donner des coups de bar de fer et comme je _suis_ l'incarnation de la morale et de la tolérance selon la gauche complètement perdue, j'aurai raison.\n\nC'est comme ça que je comprends le "gauchisme", dont le terme m'était encore flou il y a qq mois : se faire manipuler ou se gourrer tout simplement à un moment et continuer de penser être sur un piédestal d'éthique (voir devenir le nouvel oppresseur type antifa). Une forme d'aveuglement, de perte de repère due aux utopies, avec des amalgames de l'autre opposé type "il n'y aucun problème de radicalisation", ou "l'union européenne c'est forcément bien"  ou "tout est question d'environnement" - ce qui peut être vrai théoriquement mais peut être totalement paralysant et inadapté (l'autre extrême étant la fausse méritocratie de la droite).
Alright, thanks! I don't watch any entertainment stuff on youtube and I'm french, I guess that's why.
Yep this is our doom, you are right. It took time for me to realize this, I was blind with globalist propaganda (as a french my country was forced inside the EU)\n\nAny politics operate on a specific area. An area is defined by frontier, which does not mean a wall at all, it is a door, a filter : select good produced (from child labour? GMO? whatever?), money in or out (influence, tax evasion, getting more rich by removing factories, building them accross the border, and destroying lives and working condition even if it was already profitable - pure greed), people (will they integrate well with the group, do you have job available, etc. Not the same as refugee), etc.\n\nIf you remove frontier, then you have no politics or a global one, a centralized one. The farther, the less democratic, the most prone to corruption and to totalitarism (where will you run when you expose government secret? There will be no more russia or equateur). \n\nFurthermore the current system is a fucking total disaster: money sovereignty has been robbed from people and given to private banks and god-like people (#1 problem), law (parliament) are overruned by lobbies, justice is being bribed by the powerful, weapons are being build and men used for war decided for and by private interests as their military tool, media a pillar for democracy has also been subverted because of private interest - and because of it's importance in a so-called "democracy". And this is from this system that we start from and want to expand, giving the key to the current uttely corrupt elite to reproduce and furthermore worsen the situation. If you plan to build a wall out of bricks, start with clean brick otherwise the result you will end up will look like the bricks or far worse.\n\nA frontier is a membrane as any cell does, you can make your own ecosystem in it. It does not mean anything to say nationalism leads to war because a nation-state is a tool, it can be good or bad, but it is quite neutral and represent at least the possibility that something emerge out of it, like an embryo of democracy - on the contrary to capitalism which is a pyramidal structure formed by private capital, and private initiative that are supposed to grant them the privilege of being the dictator de facto in their organization. Multinational guided by greed have perverted the state and leads global war for oil and money.\n\nThis misconception is a total and complete plague because it is killing one of the best hope to have a more equal, relaxed, truthfull and free society. \n\nWe should wake the FUCK up and stop the globalism movement by all means or we are doomed  (multibillionaire, owner of mega corps pretending to care for the planet, yeah right). Take money (although not obvious money can be build from scratch any time), media, politics, democracy, justice, law making, weapon back from tyrant and from this whole system.
. . . Denver airport, etc. Does anyone have a list of all the left symbols the the impending apocalypse?
Oui, c'est la religion destinée à ceux qui dans le judaïsme n'ont pas la place du peuple élu, les juifs. Mais c'est partie intégrante du judaïsme, c'est juste que le judaïsme distingue les gentils, du peuple élu. Merci pour cette explication, en tout cas c'est sacrément raciste et selon Pierre Hillard ou mm géopolitiquement, on dirait qu'il y a des forces puissantes qui travaillent un peu dans ce sens. Non ?
Reviens quand tu auras de quoi contre argumenter.
[Le livre cité sur la page wikipedia de l'ACUE](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/aldrich/publications/oss_cia_united_europe_eec_eu.pdf), ouvre le fait un ctrl-f sur Jean Monnet.  (l'auteur apparemment: http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/aldrich/)\n\n\nPage 202\n\n>  They were\nfollowing in the footsteps of Charles P. Kindleberger and Walt W.\nRostow, two OSS economists who, in 1946, had persuaded James\nByrnes and Jean Monnet to launch the ill-fated idea of a UN-backed\nEconomic Commission for Europe.\n\nCe passage ce réfère à ce bouquin : Gillingham, Coal, Steel, and the Rebirth of Europe, p.109.\n\nEt ailleurs :\n\n> The only precisely quantifiable American\nfunds passed to Monnet during this period came through the Ford\nFoundation to support his immediate secretariat.\n\nAutre:\n\n>  It is striking that three\nimportant transnational elite groups emerging in the 1950s: the\nEuropean Movement, the Bilderberg Group and Jean Monnet's\nAction Committee for a United States of Europe all shared the\nbroadly the same origins and sources of support.\n\n Etc.
Tant mieux si c'est le cas et que cela reste ouvert pour qui souhaite appartir à une caste plutôt qu'à une autre.\n\nIl parait alors très curieux de suivre une filiation par le sang à partir du moment où la filiation par la conversion a le même poids. Une amie qui vit par exemple aux USA ont célébré la réalisation du fait qu'elle soit juive en réalisant que sa mère (qui n'était pas pratiquante) était juive par sa grand mère aussi (qui elle l'était). C'est assez curieux de ne remonter qu'aux mères, ça n'a pas de sens, hormis celui religieux.\n\nCe point de "racialisme" reste un détail par rapport au messianisme et ses conséquences.
Les naturalisés français bien sûr.
Certains médias sont assez critiques, mais rien que d'en parler c'est déjà pas mal,  ça crédibilise, ça montre chez les uns ou les autres, qu'il marque une différence, etc. Certains candidats qui ont créé leur partie depuis des années n'ont jms reçu une telle couverture médiatique (grosso modo il a plus que les deux parties du centre et que ce bon vieux épouvantail, le FN).
That one is called "Humbug" and is available on Netflix. 
Yeah, well there is [more](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18328) to it:\n\n> The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.\n\nI'll be waiting for the [false flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M84l19H68mk) promised by neocons.
Yep I got the last paragraph, thank you for taking the time to reply. That's awesome ahah!
Et bien un des problèmes c'est que les banques prennent le contrôle du système politique. Elles le prennent en otage ainsi que tout le système économique et le transforme en un système totalitaire sous leur contrôle.\n\nCe ne sont pas des entités démocratiques, ce sont des entreprises privées qui ont le privilège extraordinaire (qui devrait en partie être celui de l'État) de créer de la monnaie ex-nihilo (à partir de rien) et décident à qui prêter etc. Entre temps, elles spéculent sur les marchés et elles font totalement crasher le système, notamment comme en 2008 où elles obligent le citoyen à souffrir et à les sauver (car trop grosse pour les laisser s'effondrer selon la "loi" normal du capitalisme ou tu payes tes risques) et personne n'est responsable en fin de compte.\n\nLes banques et les marchés financiers sont l'instrument des plus riches qui spéculent sur à peu près n'importe quoi y compris sur la dette des états. Elles imposent leur loi contre celle du bien commun et de la démocratie (comme la BCE qui a milité pour [la loi El Khomri](http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/politique/2016/06/08/31001-20160608ARTFIG00232-reforme-du-marche-du-travail-la-bce-aussi-a-donne-des-ordres.php)) et supprimer la démocratie (comme c'est le cas en Grèce avec le parlement sous tutelle).
& zionist
Je suis tout à fait d'accord mais ca pose une question sachant que le projet peut être louable (comme tjrs) mais se réveler très problématique. \n\nEn tant tout cas, s'il est possible de tagger un site comme étant générateur de FakeNews plus ou moins arbitrairement, et que l'algorithme prend en compte ça pour ne pas diffuser le lien que tu souhaites pourtant partager, ca revient à de la censure.\n\nQuelle serait le processus, qui ferait le boulot pour essayer de trier le vrai du faux ? Et à quelle question prétends-on répondre - celui d'éviter des traînées de poudre d'intox, celui de filtrer l'information à priori - etc. ? Ne faudrait-il pas laisser les gens exercer leur esprit critique en fin de compte plutôt que de décider ce qui est vrai du faux par BFMTV et 20 minutes ?\n
2012. Iran si being threatened, some false flag are already coming, the script runs.
Je suis à 200% d'accord avec toi ! Sauf que oui, il y a des gens qui vont plus essayer d'affronter les banques (au moins on peut se poser la question) et d'autres qui viennent des banques et ne vont certainement pas s'y opposer au contraire.
Ah. Oui boah, si on veut être pointilleux... c'est un terme employé de façon subjective.
Il y a deux camps et un des camps "élu" (supérieur) repose notamment sur un principe de filiation par la mère, ce qui le rend raciste - même si on peut se faire accepter par ailleurs autrement (je me demande quelle valeur ont les fraichement converti par rapport à ceux qui "dans la chair de leur aïeux" ont subi les épreuves de Dieu).\n\n> Les "forces puissantes" ne cherchent pas du tout à promouvoir cette idéologie. Au contraire, ce qui est recherché, c'est la destruction des religions (au moins les religions abrahamiques) et de la morale.\n\nIl y a plusieurs forces, le capitalisme marchand s'en fout effectivement. Sauf que les guerres au moyen-orient au delà de renverser des pays pour leur ressource naturelle, pour la monnaie, de la géopolitique (je passerai sous silence la blague des Droits de l'Homme dans des coalitions avec l'Arabie Saoudit etc.) peuvent s'inscrire dans un contexte religieux, de la même façon qu'Israel a été créé précisément autour de Jérusalem, selon la vision sacré/fanatique du retour à la terre promise. Nous vivons le livre. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2xGWkN9uI\n\nCa parle notamment de l'Irak comme étant une étape. C'est le messianisme qui arrive par une série de catastrophe - éventuellement réalisé -  (voir notamment Pierre Hillard).\n\n\n
Je n'ai pas dit que Monnet était un agent de la CIA au départ, j'ai cité la CIA et j'ai mis Monnet entre parenthèse à côté. Car oui, de fait ils l'ont financé ce qui en fait un de leur cheval de troie. Cf les points au dessus.\n\n>  tout le monde le sait que les États-Unis ont soutenu la construction européenne\n\nJe ne crois pas non. On peut te rappeler ce genre de [chose](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NGU97c2F5UQ/UbXVbChwjVI/AAAAAAAAAGA/FEKVWUdKSG0/s1600/ps-maastr92.jpg). Parler de la reconstruction des pays d'Europe c'est une chose, dire qu'ils veulent un Union Européenne forte en est une autre, et on nous vend et a vendu l'inverse, l'Union Européenne pour "peser" face aux grands de ce monde comme les USA.
Ahah mais c'est abusé ce sub de gamin, -68 pour apporter quelques preuves de la violence. Si c'était des supporters de Trump qui donnait des coups de bar de fer, je pense qu'on aurait pas le mm résultat et ça, ça ferait les gros titres, tout le monde les traiteraient de nazi. Là on a le résultat contrainre, et ça, ça s'appelle être un gros mouton partisan.
Sweden always reminds me of [Barabara Spectre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYKyp1e_jYc) "Europe must go into multiculural mode", and "jews are going to be at the center of that" "jew will be resented because of our leading role".\n\nI subscribed to this [facebook chan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/279528999133185/), I can see people from this community reporting migrant misbehaviour etc. I saw also that a paper often quoted is the [Expressen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressen) journal which is owned by the [Bonnier family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnier_family)...\n\nI have trouble understanding what's going on and separating truth from lies. Could be that they are at the center of this and that they play both sides, minimizing on one hand, maximizing on the other hand, the pressure increasing until..?\n\n
Arrêtez avec cet escroc de banquier qui va vous coller une loi El Kohmri 2 comme il l'a déjà annoncé. On le voit déjà partout.
Oh right, slavery, let's go back 200 years ago and make all the "white people" (cause they are all the same, right?) pay for it NOW. Retarded & racist. How about we go back when muslims invaded France and where repealed by Charles Martel in 732 - maybe we should expel them right now! Perfectly valid argument.
She is dumb, she was about to enter a mosque, you enter a religious temple, you are supposed to show a minimum of respect for their belief. The headscarf is not mandatory in Lebanon by the way. Would she have refused to put a headscarf to cover her shoulder or whatever in a church in France? I doubt it. This is bullshit.
Every cultural, industrial, scientific, educational cooperation should be kept to me. \n\nSchengen could only be kept if they more or less share the same opinion on "extra-european" immigration policy I suppose, which does not seem to be the case, we are seing wall being set up.

Ahah c'est le monstrueux argument qui fait dire que par la sainte magie de l'élection de ton représentant (parodie de démocratie) tu es coupable de tout ce que fait ton représentant sur lequel tu n'as pourtant aucun contrôle et qui de plus t'as menti (en Droit on pourrait appeler ça un dol). \n\nDonc 1/ tu ne remets jamais en cause la légitimité de ceux qui prennent _effectivement_ les décisions ?\nEt là, pardon mais les conséquences sont très très lourdes, tu t'associes à toutes les dérives : le leader le fait, c'est que le peuple veut et ne peut qu'acquiescer ! Tu flirtes avec l'autoritarisme.\n\nJe vais donc immédiatement considérer que tu es personnellement responsable du meurtre par drone des individus choisis par François Hollande et le reste.\n\n2/ Que les responsabilités (une dette par exemple) s'héritent de père en fils ad vitam aeternam même si cela risque d'être mauvais pour dans notre cas le créancier et débiteur. \nEt par déduction immédiate, tu dois penser qu'annuler la dette du peuple allemand au lendemain de la 2nde guerre mondiale est une erreur historique.\n\n> L'Etat c'est eux.\n\nRarement entendu qq chose d'aussi caricatural voire stupide.

EU is run by the Goldman Sachs, the lobbies, it is a tax evasion platform (see Juncker, see the massive amount of money), it is killing Europe and democracy, it is disolving nation-state, they say it loud and clear : no more referendum. The EU is USSR run by neoliberal capitalist and bankers. The Euro is an utter failure, state lost control on their money. The EU is a free trade space, forcing all workers and nation to compete between each other making pull every social model to new low, uniformizing every structure, exalting the youth, summoning you to feel and be european: this share most trait with fascism. It has been pushed by industrial, the CIA etc.\n\nThis thing is a dystopia and should be scraped once and for all.
Isn't it too late already? Check out Ron Paul and Peter Dale Scott. Trump appointed Flynn . . . ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1oEoCRkLRI ) who is now threatening Iran as wanted by zionist (https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18328) after Syria massacre.\n\n> \nThe best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of\nSyria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.\n\nThe gov is filled w/ Goldman Sachs and neocons. WAKE UP America, stand up to the people pushing your people to war for their own profit.\n
What France got to do with this (he didn't try to post on it)? I agree btw for the CIA, you could add Gulf countries, Israel, USA, EU and all.
I don't know, what about looking from the point of view of wealthy versus pauvrety rather than the racial one? Maybe powder cocaine people are just way more powerful and your justice system is somehow corrupt by them - it appears that white people are more numerous in power position than black people. But what matters more is not racism but corruption.

Petite note qui vaut ce qu'elle vaut : certains étrangers votent LePen pour la cause inverse, car ils constatent que la France n'est pas la France qu'ils espéraient (des gens qui ne parlent pas français alors qu'eux on fait bcp d'effort, criminalité, etc.).
Je le fais certainement pas sur le karma, je le fais parce que ce gars est un danger. Aime le mais assume, n'en rend pas responsable les autres si leur critique sont justes.
Roseanne was a favorite TV show of mine. I have it on DVD and still watch it. The reality show was called...no joke..."Roseanne's Nuts."
I'm not the most knowledgeable person here, but I think the general wisdom is, if your routine gets you to the gym, that's a good place to start. You can change it later. I substituted things sometimes with suggestions from the back of the book. Other things I skipped altogether due to some issues with my joints that I can't really do anything about. I noticed huge improvements in day to day practical strength, a big time decrease in back pain, and an improvement of sleep quality. I did strong Curves three times a week and cardio or yoga/stretching the other days. \n\nEdited to add: when I first started I wasn't always able to finish all of my reps/sets. I'd stick with my baseline for a week and make it a goal to add reps/sets each week. With a lot of things (like squats) I started with body weight only. I used dumbbells to start with RDL's and HATED them, now they're my favorite and I do them with the Olympic bar. 
The point that I was trying to make is that it isn't new for teachers to see the least qualified person put in charge of what we're doing. It happens all the time on a smaller scale. I didn't say Betsy DeVos wouldn't be horrible. I said that we will do our best to deal with what gets thrown at us as a result of her appointment, because we've always done our best to deal with the horrible things that get thrown at us. I'm extremely disappointed, but not surprised. \n\nThanks for the insult, though. I was a few short of making my quota today. 
Go talk to your union/professional association rep and see what they suggest. They'll be very familiar with your district's policies. 
Huh. That was an X-Files episode, too. One of the early ones. It was in the fried chicken. 
I'm not sure why you got downvoted. I know it's just Harry Potter but the quote "He Who Must Not Be Named did great things. Terrible, yes, but great." comes to mind. "Great", "awesome", etc do not all have to have positive connotations. 
I have a six year old cat who I socialized. I found her in a parking lot when she was about ten weeks old-not prime socialization age. I had to use a trap to catch her, and I wore about ten layers of clothing to wash all of the parking lot grime off of her. She was horribly dirty and malnourished, and wouldn't allow me to even touch her for over a month. It took a lot of getting her to associate me with food, sitting in the corner and talking to her, etc. Chicken baby food is like kitten crack and I got a lot of mileage out of about ten jars. Anyway, now she's clingy as hell and will often insist that I carry her on my shoulder while doing chores around the house. She only likes my family, though. She won't let anyone else near her. 
This is precisely why I no longer bring my friendly, very social pit bull to the dog park. He weighs 90 pounds and has a blockhead, so any time there is even the slightest bit of confrontation between dogs, he gets blamed. We just stopped going. Unfortunate, but we aren't willing to risk a judge forcing us to put him down or pay someone else's vet bills. 
 Bitten by a camel at a drive thru animal park (yes, that's a thing. We were less educated about the welfare of captive animals in the late 80's/early 90's). 
I met him several years ago at some UFO lecturers. He came across as very genuine and down to earth, and he had a great deal of physical evidence. Really interesting case. 
/r/abrathatfits changed my life. She should check it out. (Not an expert but I'm guessing based on my own experience that she needs larger cups and a tighter band). 
Rain in the desert. 
When they line up and then get out of sync, then line up again, then get out of sync, etc that is called phasing. It's a favorite device of composer Steve Reich. \n\nSee:\n[Four Organs](https://g.co/kgs/Kv1v0i)\n[Piano Phase](https://g.co/kgs/kbYgpe)\n[Cello Counterpoint](https://youtu.be/bT5PwL3RDIA)
In a lot of Texas schools, we also pledge allegiance to the Texas flag. 
The guy on the left has the sort of posture that makes my back hurt just looking at him. 
There's a presentation called "Notes and Neurons" (available for free online) that you would probably find interesting. Bobby McFerrin is featured. 
They'll just rename it with a new acronym like they do for everything else. 
Exactly. And children/teenagers are often right at the beginning or smack in the middle of transitioning. Most of them are still figuring it out. 
Feral cats often aren't very vocal, anyway. Ours has been socialized for years and she hardly makes any noise at all. Even when she does meow you can barely hear it. 
Our dogs love vegetables. We have to watch them closely when we're making salad, as they'll steal all of the big scraps. (And we don't want them to eat too much of anything and have diarrhea. Our lab has been known to eat a whole head of broccoli). 
This reminds me of what it's like to live with an illness that impacts the body. I have a daily checklist to follow that allows me to budget my energy. If I deviate from it, I might have to give something up because I just won't have the energy later. (For example, if I'm planning on cooking dinner, but I have a day at work that requires me to do something physical I wasn't planning on, I will likely leave work and discover I physically don't have the ability to cook.)
There's a comedy band in my city who made a song with this joke. The chorus goes something like, "son, I got to say no. The girl is your sister but your mama don't know."  Except at the end where the mama says "son, go man, go!  Hell your papa ain't your papa but your papa don't know!"
You get to go to Disney?  I get to take a sweaty bus ride once a year to Six Flags. 
Carl's Jr.  Fuck you, I'm eating. 
Dogs love having jobs to do. 
Hell, I teach high school and I don't even make the high school kids ask. The pass is by the door. Get up, go, make it quick. Don't interrupt my teaching to ask if you can go pee. If it becomes a problem I'll talk to the kid. This is how MOST college classes are if I remember correctly. If I were OP, I'd get up and go, and if the professor yelled at me I'd remind him/her that I'm an adult who is *paying* to take the class. I'm more than capable of knowing when I need to pee and when I don't. Everybody in that thread sucks. 
It would take an awful lot to get the classical music community to switch back to 432. A lot of orchestras actually tune to 442 now. 
In the immortal words of Tom Lehrer: "2,4,6,8, time to transsubstantiate!" https://g.co/kgs/GsT24y
Near Las Vegas isn't really surprising. That's Area 51/Groom Lake area. I've camped out there before and there are sometimes a lot of sonic booms from test flights and exercises. 
I'm a licensed teacher with my fingerprints on file, and while I accept that this is a standard part of my job and has to be done, I still don't like it. (My tinfoil hat gives me plenty of reasons). 
Drive like you are the only competent driver on the road, and everyone else is a moron. You'll soon learn this is the case anyway. I think the technical term is "defensive driving."
I have bad knees (over 20 years of RA joint damage) so I skip anything that's single leg. My legs work together or not at all. The few times I tried single leg, I wanted to die. 
I run on musician time: early is on time, on time is late. I hate waiting around for people. 
Or, people who should have kids can't and get to watch their dumb family members who shouldn't have kids reproduce at an alarming rate. 
My politics are pretty far left, and I don't like what GWB did in office. But I watched some interviews with him about 9/11, and he at least comes across as very genuine. 
Pop a Poppler in your mouth,\nWhen you come to Fishy Joe's,\nWhat they're made of is a mystery,\nWhere they come from, no one knows.\nYou can pick 'em, you can lick 'em,\nYou can chew 'em, you can stick 'em,\nif you promise not to sue us,\nYou can shove one up your nose.
There are a lot of practical reasons for everyone to use the same tuning frequency. I was part of an orchestra concert tour in Europe once, and we would tune to the piano of each concert hall we played in. Some were tuned at 440 and some were at 442. Tuning when your ears are adjusting after getting off of a plane is bad enough-tuning to different frequencies all the time really screws with your internal pitch. Someone with perfect pitch would be driven nuts by different tuning frequencies. So whether they pushed for it or not, I imagine with traveling musicians and with recordings being sent around the globe, a standard tuning was more practical. Personally, I find it difficult sometimes to listen to very old recordings or to recordings of "authentic performance practice" of baroque works in which the tuning is dropped below 440. They all sound very flat. 
Years ago a late night talk show host did a segment on immigration and took a whole bunch of Texans who has been profiled as illegal immigrants and did exactly this. I can never find the clip, but it was gold. 
Fair enough. 
Trust No One. \n\n(I can't believe nobody said that yet. I thought that was standard procedure around here.)
I started making this recently and it's my new favorite. Have you made grilled cheese sandwiches with it yet?
Make sure it never tastes human flesh. "Feed me, Seymour!"
God that looks so incredibly delicious! Thank your taking the time to share it op! 
I really enjoy cinnamon pickles. The idea is similar, but usually you start with cucumbers-not pickles that are already made. 
Teacher here. On the one hand, she's horrible and extremely unqualified. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure at this point that 99% of the people in charge of education in this country are extremely unqualified. These types of positions really should require at least ten years of classroom experience, but most of my administrators don't even have that. The people evaluating what kind of job I do are a) not familiar with my field, at all, and b) not as experienced in the classroom. To say that teachers are accustomed to people who are unqualified being in charge is an understatement. Those of us in the trenches will continue to fight like always, and for everything that gets taken away, we'll give more of ourselves to fill the gap. We've been doing it forever because our system is so very broken. \n\nTL;DR: I'm disappointed but not surprised. Same old song and dance. 
Humans are so invasive that sometimes it seems perfectly logical that we aren't a native species. 
I started SC about two years ago and am on a long hiatus currently (money and health). Are you doing the beginner program?  I found it challenging at first and really, really had to push myself to get through the first two weeks. After that, it got easier. I never really got bored with it because it has so many different things going on. I also modified where I needed to. 
> its a vile stream that runs under the ground and it begins to have an effect and takes its toll\n\nI've seen that one. I heard the stuff in that vile stream really likes [Jackie Wilson](https://youtu.be/irvlbKM-aqE)\n\nSeriously, though, John Podesta knows a thing or two about undermining democracy, doesn't he?
I agree. They're getting video of a ceremony. I'm willing to bet that some of the people commenting have taken video at a wedding, or their kids' baptisms, or their kids' kindergarten graduations. 
My grandma and grandpa met as pen pals when he was serving in WWII. He was among the troops in Japan post nuclear bomb and wouldn't really talk about it except to say, "they heard I was coming and decided to just stop fighting." 
My eyes are so sensitive to onions that no matter what tricks I use to reduce the sting (frequently running the knife and cutting board under water, for example), I have to stop and put a wet cloth or paper towel over my eyes a few times just to get through one onion. Anyway, I married a guy who gets horrible digestive upset from onions.  I'm kind of relieved that we don't even keep them in the house. Match made in heaven. (I'll still eat onions; I just don't ever prepare them.)
Teacher here, different state. There is a religious group that meets in my room during lunch, but I am not their sponsor and they do not have a staff member as a sponsor. In my district, at least, teachers can't lead religious organizations or events at school. They can be present and supervise, though. (I usually hide in another room. I'm not religious at all.)
Right?  
Guanajuato, Mexico is s very enjoyable city. Go up the road a little bit to Vallenciana, which is also great. 
It doesn't look like it fits particularly comfortably either. 
I want to know....but I'm also a little afraid to know. 
Too old and too married. I hope you find a nice lady to share your tinfoil with. 
The spin on killing the TPP is ridiculous. It's like "this is a good thing but Trump touched it so now it has cooties."  
I guess more people need to remind Senator Scott that he works for them, so it doesn't really matter who *he* supports and what *he* thinks, now does it? 
That was 100% worth it. Thank you. 
Personal anecdote here, not a lawyer (and sure as hell not a financial advisor). My SO and I filed chapter 7 back in September. We still have student loan debt but we discharged a lot of credit card and medical debt. My credit score jumped 200 points immediately after we filed. We didn't have any more debt than you do, but my SO had been out of work for almost a year and had to have back surgery. The unemployment ran out and the situation was pretty bad. Go to a free consultation and see what they tell you. Good luck!
Actually it's been seen every year since 1997. 
I was going to say petting my dogs and felt like a horrible person, but they're busy wrestling with each other. So I'm giving up watching live dog wrestling. 
We cut the cord a couple of months ago. Best decision we've made in a long time. 
Musician here. I can't get behind 432. It sounds too flat to my ears, especially in keys or modes that are supposed to sound bright. I'm a string player so A440 is burned into my brain. Many European orchestras now even prefer the brighter sound of 442, which I don't mind as much, but I still prefer 440. Habit and routine I guess.
This was the first thing I thought of as well. 
Music teacher here. Like any aid we use for beginning students (finger tapes on string instruments, "cheater notes" that make reading easier, etc) this is a good idea ONLY temporarily. Otherwise, you'll learn to rely solely on your eyes and not on sound and muscle memory. This will make ensemble playing down the road challenging if not impossible, and you'll have more limited opportunities for learning new material. So, cool gadget that probably has awesome implications for beginners and for people with certain disabilities-but use it ONLY as a beginner. 
Same!  It makes me feel horrible just to think about it. 
Obama was supposed to be the antichrist. Still waiting to be raptured so I can skip work tomorrow. Just kidding!  I'll be stuck here on earth with the rest of you heathens. 
She had a reality show several years ago, and she came across as pretty genuine and as a good person. She even redeemed her national anthem travesty by singing it well at a local baseball game. 
That's partly because this was a collaboration with African artists. It's even more significant because this was during Apartheid in South Africa, and Paul Simon was criticized for traveling and performing there (there was a boycott, I think.). Ladysmith Black Mambazo is featured a lot on the Graceland album and can be heard in the chorus of You Can Call Me Al. 
Our local 7/11 didn't do it the last time I checked.
This is my all time favorite movie!  I had no idea about this, though. Thanks for sharing. 
I wish I had the money to give you gold. 
It's 90 miles away.  Many of their employees are flown in and out of Vegas every day. It's not completely unreasonable to think that there might be some testing close to Vegas. 
None of our equipment for tuning (pitch generators like McAdams or strobe tuners like Peterson) is calibrated for 432, although there are some tuners/pitch machines that you can adjust. Most pianos are tuned to 440, and unless you cart your own 432 piano with you everywhere or want to pay to have a piano retuned for every performance and rehearsal, you're tuning to the piano in the concert hall in which you're performing. \n\nEdit: I'm talking of course about orchestral performance here. Singers would also be affected if they're using a piano. 
I don't care one bit how much my engagement ring cost. It seems weird to me that anyone does. 
Look up the definition of "stage presence" and I'm pretty sure you'll find Tim Curry's picture. The man owns whatever set/stage he's on. 
This is 100% due to the bus schedule. Superintendents don't run school districts. The guy who runs the bus barn runs the school district.
Ok, I'm confused. Is OP banned for saying "death to all whites", or did OP get banned and the mods said "death to all whites"?
Around here we have cameras that catch you doing that, and you have to pay a $75 fine when you get a nasty letter in the mail with your picture on it. 
It's possible that Kutcher is sincere but being used. 
This is now a graduation requirement in Texas as well. 
NAL. If you happen to run into this person again, maybe just ask them. "Hey, I want to be helpful. To what degree should I be fragrance free in order to help you out?"  At that point they might tell you, "you were not the problem", or "the only thing I can smell coming from you is x" and then you can just change that one thing. 
This doesn't specify which city. I live on the border and a colleague of mine has had almost weekly sightings (average...sometimes it's more than once a week). We also have a great deal of military air traffic, and every time he has a sighting he'll watch jets chase it away. I've seen the pictures and they are similar to the ones in the video, but are usually spotted at a greater distance. 
Kids spent more time playing outside and parents were generally less protective, allowing kids to test their physical boundaries and develop balance and coordination. 
I'm picturing the little footsteps and hearing the bad sound effects from the Carmen Sandiego game when you're right on a henchman's trail. 
There's usually a "how" also, but who knows. 
The standardized testing tire fire must be too big to fit in the cartoon. \n\nSource: Texas teacher, watching my kids get benchmarked and STAARed to death. \n\nEdit: and who exactly do we think will take advantage of this?  
I went to Michoacán around 2008. I probably wouldn't have gone back soon after that, but I'd go now. 
Done!  I hope someone can find it!
Kind of like chemo. In order to kill the cancer, it's got to make you really really sick without killing you. It's poison. 
This is a great idea in theory, but until we stop over testing and over scheduling our kids, it won't help. I teach music in a high school that doesn't start the day until almost 9. Most of my kids are in advanced academics and state graduation requirements up to their eyeballs. The only way that about 60% (not exaggerating) of my kids in my advanced group can take my class-which is the only reason some of them are motivated to show up and pass their classes-is to take it before school. If you didn't pass the state test, or if you're failing a class, you come before or after school for tutoring. If you're in sports, you stay in the evening. If you play in more than one musical ensemble, or if you have a combo like band and theatre, you're going to come in early and stay late. The majority of my kids are at school from 7:30-5:30 even though our official school day is more like 9-4. And that's on a typical day, and lo and behold, it still isn't good enough. We'll spend an hour during our next "professional development" reviewing test data with a fine-toothed comb, and then we'll probably add some more Saturday camps or before school tutoring sessions. \n\nTL;DR: this is a great idea, but it won't work until we fix our broken and inefficient public education system. 
You are my hero. 
One of my colleagues at school (I'm a teacher) greeted me the other day with "good morning, fellow wage slave."  I think Americans are coming to this realization. The question is, what are we going to do about it?
I teach high school. Most of my kids are chauffeurs and babysitters for their younger siblings. It's unfortunate, but its reality for a lot of parents working two jobs or working and going to school full time so that they can keep the lights on and food on the table. 
Teacher here. The kids are about 2% of my problems. The other adults make up the other 98%. 
Like my grandma always said, there's no shame in being poor but remember soap and water are cheap.

It is not a conspiracy that maybe 80% central american women crossing the U.S. border is raped? \n\nWhy is that not a conspiracy?\n\nSeems to me like a pretty nasty conspiracy. \n\nDo you know how many children are raped or sold as sex slaves?\n\nAgain why is this not a conspiracy?

CNN? Really? You need to open your sources wider and across a spectrum, and engage in critical thinking, honestly. \nI see literally cold busted flat out fake news and manipulation by CNN called out daily. Daily! That's not even remotely qualified to be called news. \nCNN simply isn't news it is psychological warfare emotional manipulation against you, and nothing more. People will treat you how you let them treat you.
Can dish it out better be able to take it.
I get a lot of hate and problems on Imgur all the time. 
2015 is recently? I remember that story, no one saw it and I live in the dead center of MB. Everyone thought it was fake as fuck just like half the news out there. I guess the 25 people that call themselves KKK vacationed to Myrtle Beach. You'll have to do better than that when the city is invaded every year for BLACK BIKE WEEKS and flooded with gangs for two weeks straight to the point we have military around. 1 MILLION+ a year on those weeks.
Milo's no pedo  he is a **victim of it** when he was really small. All he did was relate what happened.
She is so cringe. Ugh.
I've got thick skin. He accused me of being a shill with 0 evidence, I blew him out of the water citing 3 citations of many available, you rush in to apparently defend him. 
They've stalled the confirmations longer than any and they're taking scalps one by one before Trump even has his team assembled, and at the same time I have never in my life heard left media speak with this level of absolute HATE. Ever and I am 46. Trump needs to drop hammer, and drop it fucking HARD.
Link isn't loading images, what's the spreadsheet depicting?
Honestly, the only pure hate, negative inconsiderate incivility, vulgarity and disrespect I see is coming from you. Whatever your worldview is, or what put such hatefulness in you, but it doesn't sound like the utopia I want to be any part of.
They influence a lot. Ron Paul even gets respect from the left. That's saying something they don't even respect themselves!
I haven't either but I am going to purchase the ingredients this evening because this recipe looks stellar!\nThank you OP!
That's what makes me wonder, why didn't Breitbart and cpac stand by him? I feel like he did so much for us and he didn't get the backing he deserves. He's not in the wrong. I feel like Trump should have cancelled his date with Cpac and no one would attend. In fact I feel like he should say "If ANY republican attends Cpac they are no longer a republican in good standing."\n
❤🐸👌\nHurting for Milo : /
Exactly, that kind of thinking is fascist intolerance itself. Pure double-speak projection. Of course I'll be down voted for speaking the truth.\nNo one that I've seen here says, "this is my usual right sources, and this is my usual left sources and this is my preferred libertarian sources to keep both in check on the authoritarian scale."\nAre you all aware most people try to do that while keeping an eye out for new sources?\nThis sub is a horror show of willful bias reinforcement.
Oh link Salon the ultra hard left rag that promotes pedophelia. Come on man. That's not a citation it is intellectual belligerence.
You can tell Trump sees a young himself in Rand just the way he picks at him. There's love there.
No matter what I post on Imgur it gets down voted and hate commented almost instantly. BADLY. 
Ever look in one of their subs? Every other comment is "You know he would have beat Trump!". \n\nLawls.

Powerful oratory, I like his objectivity.
Except it's 20 years older than the current administration, has supported libertarians and even Kucinich on the moderate left. That is a misquote, and libel. 
I've heard him get mad at Trump a few times, then soon after Trump adjusted what he was doing. He's become more pro-Trump but calling him always a fan is mischaracterizing.
He's a liberal though, so that's okay. Don't ya know.
I couldn't stop laughing when I saw that tweet from a congressman :D
My heart and thoughts are with you, though we never met, I will carry you and Kujo through my day, and then seal it with a prayer.
Not at all. Fair is fair right? Let's Tweet this.
Same I stayed with Rand until he dropped out, the same way I still to this day stand for Ron Paul.
Fuck your double standards.
I Tried to submit this to two libtard subs: Maher and Samharris and they banned me from both, one even accused me that I am trying to make money from it (Have the messages if you want to see). \nI replied: Fuck you.

There may be in some fantasy, but like I said I have never met a white supremacist,  and I have met, literally, hundreds and encounter every single day black supremacists. The media and left sycophants are trying to create the illusion that it is  equal when it is probably a ratio of 99% - 1% Black racists to White racists. Or less.
I'm not sure triggered is the correct way to describe what I am thinking, more frustration and revulsion than anything else, CNN is so far over the top moon bat fake pure fabrication and manipulative, caught red handed every day, literally that I find it truly disgusting. Even hearing it in the back ground , and the condescending, hateful disdainful tone from it to me is like being caught in a fun house from a movie. It's crazy town calling itself news to me. Like a [sick](https://youtu.be/LIAs4SXNFjo) twisted parody. Nothing but baseless slander. I mean come on what exactly the hell is [this thing](https://youtu.be/wWcnM7rsvLk) , a hate monster? CNN is over the top insane and so unbelievably viciously racist.
> While Trump himself doesn't have any direct ties to Putin (that we know of) \n\nYou should have ended it there. 
For real tell me if she was your wife or GF and dude spoke like that toward her you wouldn't rip his shit out the frame. I'm LIVID watching it and I don't even know the girl. Does CNN and it's viewers have no sense of decency at all? Any morals? 
I'm not signing that BECAUSE every time I post a Paul Joseph Watson video or anything that does well here including  Trump it gets DOWN VOTED to ZERO in Sargons sub. So fuck you all and stop Hijacking Pepe into a cucked liberal meme you unoriginal liberal twats.

It's not right what is happening to him. Not right at all.
Yeah, evidently, but the double standard is glaring. I don't see a "just" about it.  Anyone else with that mouth would be branded, then drawn and quartered. Why does she get away with it? Hate is hate.\n\nI remember when Obama was first elected, I did not vote for him, but I hoped he would come out like a MLK. I didn't even begin to get vocally angry until the 3rd year of his first term. This isn't right.\nNo officials or news was calling for impeachment when he was only in office a few weeks. This is insane. I mean. Really enemy of the state level insane.
Then it isn't a cesspool, is it, rather your bias is. A large portion of the people posting there are military. It shows.

that must have taken you a while!
its there! but as a documentary I thought I would also post in /r/documentaries
same here, it took me a while to make it to the book - I watched the 1984 release with John Hurt before I knew anything of the story, if you have time, try to find a copy of that online
I would love to see a futuristic styled Lord Of The Rings - Lord Of The Rings 40k
The whole event was controlled, everyone involved was where they had to be, or not to be as it were, so the chain of command failed. \n\nAnd the air force were conducting drills on the other side of the country, rendering the response and a successful interception of any of the 4 aircraft negative. Those planes flew around for an hour without any kind of interference.\n\nThen there is the clean up, literally and figuratively.\n\nIt all stinks\n
A lone wolf researcher collected all of the available information on the colliding airliners, including many if not all aspects of film, and with it created a 3D simulation which seems fairly accurate. And from this I think you can get a good idea of the velocity of the jets
I think that it is proven that the universe expands in such a way that we are in the center of it, or the known parts but so is every other galaxy or solar system.  \n\nBut if you're going to talk about what has been "scientifically proven", how's about we start we the earth is a huge sphere
Because basically, for a fact checker to exist, they would have to draw lines and make those facts. \n\nWho will draw those lines?\n\nWhat if they say, 2 + 2 = 5!?
Im not sure how it works, or how they say it works. \n\nBut don't think its a healthy idea to have, I think its dangerous. And I think its a little ignorant, even arrogant, Especially when we are talking about God, not to go religious, as religious I am not, but God in all his might, is greater than a "flat earth" 
Stars?
They do, but this is a large drawing, using fineliners to fill it in would take a while, and to get good solid colours you need to layer the inks in neat long strips, So maybe get some sharpie markers too.\n\nI would use fineliners to carefully detail the spaces further - starting with the edges of spaces, gently blending those black lines inwards, into the scenery.\n\nThen use something like a sharpie to fill in the larger areas.
I love Amsterdam!
It is, but we have to remain hopeful
I have seen things that suggest images are manipulated.\n\nFrom youtube videos where apparently official media from certain satellites has been distorted and shows evidence of superimposed objects, to Gary McKinnon who details certain folders (Raw & Processed, I think) in the NASA system, which according to him both contained a collection of pictures.\n\nAnd no curvature? I don't know, I find that hard to believe. I flew at 30 thousand feet twice this week, And yeah, it is flat - but it's flat in every direction, and it's consistent.  \n\nAnd what about the stars? Can people in the Falklands see Polaris in the night sky?\n\nAnd what about all the antique globes? Detailing navigation around a globe by the view of stars?\n\nAnd If I fly at 30 thousand feet at night, why cant I see a bright light shining down on the other side - very far away\n\n\nQuick word from Google :-\nIf the world had been flat, then two sticks in different locations would produce the same shadow: But they don't. This is because the earth is round, and not flat: Eratosthenes (276-194 BCE) used this principle to calculate the circumference of the Earth quite accurately.
ODD? is that not the fellow who promotes flat earth theories?
I don't think it's BS, I wouldn't post something I thought that was. I'm not standing by every word the guy says, but Oswald didn't do all that alone.  
Yo thanks for sharing

I am glad that you like it
There's a good piece of film which has been posted, 'September 11 A New Pearl Harbor', it questions A lot of the Official Narrative of events and numbers, only it is 5 hours in its entirety.. still worth a watch by my account
Ill repeat what others have said, for a serious take on the conversation, check out :-\n\n'September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor'.  A 5 hour film, summarizing 12 years of public debate. 
draw draw draw!
You think explosives sat there for 30 years waiting for someone to fly a plane in to the towers?
thanks for sharing ill check them out
Spoliers!!!
That shark in the corner is cute, nice doodles!
I've just returned from Amsterdam, and saw a framed picture of Lennon and yoko in bed at the Hilton there, hypocrite was my first thought.
And that there made uploading it worth it
copics are tasty! I really like those first few
lovely!
This fellow didn't analyze the pentagon, as it was confirming photography against the data from the airlines. And I haven't seen any photography of a plane in D.C. other than the 5 frames taken from a toll booth outside the pentagon.\n\nBut.\n\n(https://youtu.be/oFAhXEqQ6ow) '9/11 - Pentagon - A Closer Examination' 30mins, this is a pretty good analysis of the facts around the pentagon. \n\n(https://youtu.be/d1nXc89oYQk) Analysis of the hijackers
thanks for the support!
glad you found an interest!  have you ever read 1984 by George Orwell? If not, Do so!
'"September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor" is a 5 hour documentary that summarizes 12 years of public debate on 9/11. All the most important issues in the debate are presented in full detail, showing both the positions of those who reject the official version, the 9/11 Truth Movement, and the positions of those who support it, called "the debunkers." You can be the judge.'
Classic!
It's only what I would do
This is also my conclusion, it is a nice idea but yes it is against free speech! Let politicians lie, let us debate them!
We would have to go back in to history and fact check all those claims, because you can't tell the truth on top of a bed of lies..\n\nOr instead of believing everything you are told, go out and check that shit for yourself.\n\nFreedom of speech!
I can repeat the first two lines, but 9/11 was an attack by terrorists.\n\nbut by the documented ones?\n\nmaybe they were indeed agents, but to me it seems it is more likely that they were framed. \n\nLike you say, flying at those speeds in that manner would, according to experienced pilots, be extremely difficult for both the pilot and the aircraft. \n\nThey cover the names & numbers quite well in the 5 hour film 'September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor'
thanks I'm going to give that a listen
Might have been myself who posted it. Anyway I'm glad you like it!

It called for a quiet revolution, putting brother against brother, and diverting the public's attention from what is really going on"
Show this to your friends, your brothers, your sisters, your parents and their parents
This excellent piece of work is almost 5 hours long!\n\nI recommend treating this as a series by breaking it up in to the segments discussed (eg. Flights, Terrorists, Buildings)\n\nAlso recommend you watch this with a friend, it helps to have someone bounce information off of!\n

It did happen again.
Okay consider the Scanning Electron Microscope and Transmission Electron Microscope, these tools use electrons in light to capture extreme close-ups. The (SEM) captures widths down to 5 microns, capable of 3D surface imaging. The (TEM) captures a 2D layer like slicing a new loaf of bread. IBM also had A Boy And His Atom. With this control, Gaseous State Drive sounds about right considering we could eventually be programming just some atoms in a micro box vacuum. Think about that as a computer, just tons of ones and zeros, and it is now instant.

Yes and remember these constant singular vibrations changing the concentration of atoms is what we experience as time. It's an abrupt sound like a clap and everything your atoms do to react to it is your experience in that moment. But the universe doesn't need time, all these vibrations happened at once, the universe is everything is everything. Feeling a difference like a chair isn't a computer, well it was arbitrary to even end up in that predicament originally IMPORTANT; but because you were in that predicament, you cannot be wrong, you are never wrong in where you are. We are delayed in emotion, awareness slowly shows us the singular process taking place. We can separate our minds from everything and be one of our own. I am here, it is true. You can't be aware of two realities without thinking about the other making that one 'experienced' therefore pointless. When you love someone and start to love someone else, well exactly, you can't love two people the same way without thinking about it. Unfortunately it's like a key in a box and it's that key that opens the box. It's literally being aware of what you were just NOT aware of. The moment though, has no meaning, like how you literally just reacted to 'the moment has no meaning.' that was it, a feeling, but it's currently impossible to understand. Any meaning that conflicts you, is decievingly actually meaningless. There has to be meaning to raise a conflict, so a conflict you feel like you have no way out of, means just in that moment you are experiencing a feeling of, 'i can't back out of this situation.' it doesn't matter the conflict, that was the emotion, no more meaning. It's very wierd. As you become more aware, it eventually goes from thinking more and more, to thinking less because you don't need to anymore, it's all about feeling, no information involved. It's being free of all realities, being in the present and one with all. It's where time doesn't exist. I'm close I just hope I get to save everyone <and that there exactly means I have more to learn. If I want to be everything I can't be, 'I hope I get to save everyone,' that is being something.. do you see what limitless actually means?

Wow. Just, wow. \nI read the OP's original post and the update. It's extremely off-putting to think what the intent of taking the baby away would be. 
I can't remember the full story or much about it, but i remember reading somewhere on /r/pizzagate before it got banned (maybe on voat now i dno) about someone mentioning a woman who would do this for the pedos (call people and get information, keep records and updates for the pedos in charge) I also remember them mentioning this woman worked for some real child services style company. Sorry for the lack of info I just remembered a few tiny details and since the pizzagate sub is gone I cba searching the entire internet lol.

Never relay trusted Burnie even though he says a lot of good things, all politicians lie. He is most likely a Zionist imo.
I honestly don't know I think it must be something to do with his channel in general, maybe some kind of inside joke. I'm too lazy to actually check the guys channel out lol. Because I got high.
cicada!
Never really believed that guy myself, seemed like he was putting on a show, all that dilly dallying at the start even though he says he doesn't have much time, Art is the one who tries to speed him up lol. He apparently called back up a few weeks later and was really calm, but it might not have been the same guy i dno.
It will be some bullshit about russia i bet.
looked a lot like it but i'm not conviced thats what it was, it has a point on the bottom and the sides aren't simetrical. also has more of a cross on the top/middle part.
Guys! What if tomorrow is some satanic ritual that makes us all eat pizza!!! Think I'm in the wrong sub... ignore me.
By all means look into him, didn't really seem to be lying though. He said he never saw any evidence of JA abusing children or had any involvment with trafficking. All he really claimed was that JA raped him.
UPDATE. Okay So I tested it out on IGNs channel, Got it down by about 100 subs in about 1min(Sorry IGN i'm sure it won't hurt though) But then it blocked me from subscribing to any channels! Maybe the 'fix'/block is already in action.\n\nEDIT. Youtube team on twitter said that the problem started on Monday... Do I smell bullshit? I reckon its some tool they have accidently enabled OR they have enabled it this week for a reason, distraction maybe? Blame it on hackers?

I would agree with you, but look what i found https://photos1.blogger.com/hello/74/1027/400/Mar31%20(PS)0016.jpg
I agree that trump is not a good guy, and in many ways he could be worse than any leader before him. He's clearly on the side of Zionists, and he may very likely be a pedo himself. The whole system needs removing and power should go to thepeople. Make the internet president of something.
suppose its just a coincidence that a lot of the pizzagate stuff has these symbols all over it?https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols

Maybe they use them for some kind of trade/or to identify each other, and the coins we see were misplaced/accidently used to pay for something? OR they do it to be arogant and try rub the worlds face in what they do. Just like the companies using the logos, all the mad art at comet ping pong etc etc

If you zoom right in it look pretty trippy, like some cicada shit to me, but totally agree it has similarity to the rebel alliance logo.

I'm so deep these days, addicted to those fucking red pills! I'm wondering if we're in a simulated video game and the elites have just figured out a way to play it.
I was just pointing out the fact. How many coincidences do we need before everyones starts realising there are no coincidences?
-1016 now!
I need more!
This is why i'm on the fence. I saw a video of someone showing how to fake a video/livestream using George bushes face and it looked very very real. The same could have happened for the Assange videos/streams etc. And Wikileaks seem to have been taken over by shills imo, or they have some gamechanging endgame info ready to leak(i'm hopeful, but it seems doubtful tbh)
Same day as trumps meetings with Japans prime minister.
I think the point is to show that this has happened before, many times with a lot of these stories/links. It has happened before and been COVERED UP BEFORE. If we point out how many times it has happened maybe we can prevent it from happenig again.
People should use this to raise awareness for pizzagate
I don't really know why most pizzagaters have it in their minds that Trump and Sessions are these big heroes who are going to save the day. I do hope something is done to put a stop to all this child porn/sextrafficking/torture/murder, But realistically, if this is true, its been going on for a very very VERY long time. Why would it suddenly get stopped now? The people are the only ones who can make a difference now, We need to stop relying on the untrustworthy's. IMO Trump has shown no interest in pedogate.(If he has said something relating to it at some point please could someone throw me a cheeky link?)
Thanks for this! Good work, I wonder about the suggestion the twitch stream was fake, I'll look into it more. Thanks again for sharing this!
Sorry I don't get it.
Really? How do you know?
Pizzagate isn't just about ping pong comet pizza w/e. Its about the government being involved with pedophilia.
Shiiiit...
I agree that trump is not a good guy, and in many ways he could be worse than any leader before him. He's clearly on the side of Zionists, and he may very likely be a pedo himself. The whole system needs removing and power should go to thepeople. Make the internet president or something.
He didn't need to research. He was in with the Zionists, he knew the future that had planned.
Just make fake emails/facebooks etc?
Some of it has come true.
What is this?
Lol maybe not that mad, but still pretty mad.
I know! Way ahead of its time.
Holy Shit! Good Read.
No its about human trafficking and pedophilia being used by and controlled by people of power and people in the government.
I agree that trump is not a good guy, and in many ways he could be worse than any leader before him. He's clearly on the side of Zionists, and he may very likely be a pedo himself. The whole system needs removing and power should go to thepeople. Make the internet president of something.
Could be something like that, it could have been some way for the pedos rights people trying to spread their message or something as well though, they seem to see themselves as like gay pride people or something lol. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile_Information_Exchange\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Man/Boy_Love_Association

Thank you! Omg just watching pewdiepies subbs... going down so fast!
I read somewhere that a bear is a sign of rape abduction and the eating of children to the occult.
The 4chan guy said that as well. Mentioned something about having to go tocivil war.
Everyone at thedonald seems to think he's going to get all the pedos, I'm not so sure what to think.
So it seems. Some accounts subs seem locked though, not going up or down at all.
The fbianon guy who first mentioned that his would come out. 
Everyone is brainwashed.
This is something big I would say. \n\nEdit. Who knows though, Maybe now we know about it they will 'fix' it.
His channel went down to -470 subs last I checked. He was on 29k earlier today I think he said.
Oh shit, What if Sessions is actually involved though and this is all some big show they are putting on for us?
Because it is narrated by Ricky Dearman, the father of the whistleblower children, he is also the one who they accused was in charge of the cult in the area. And the Clinton foundation got involved with Haiti, loads of kids went missing, Laura silsby etc etc.
Trump and Japan are about to do a press conference right now, team up against pedos?

Well think about this:\n\n1) right-side + lefty-loosey = side-loosey\n\n2) side-loosey + door-handle = loosey-handle\n\n3) loosey-handle / side-loosey^0.5 = (right-side + lefty-loosey) + door-handle / side-loosey^0.5\n\nTherefore we result with a remainder of "left-handle" which is the etymolgy for *left-hand* [thread].\n\nCan someone check this out?
Service parts are over run production and when the over run production is depleted and assembly lines have long gone to new platforms, service parts costs go up because that is what suppliers do after the agreed quantity of service parts have been produced, theu get to charge more because they may need to rework tools if they havent already.

Fuck man, I opened the screen capture with a reddit app and thought me phone got hacked or crashed for a split second
Hate to break it to you, this is reddit so 9/10 you're a neck beard with no experience with guns besides COD.
It's not a baited post and your arguments are weak in-lieu of examples I provided, my opinion of course.  If someone can school me, I am open and waiting. Saying a President is lying is pretty much a given, I guess you're alluding to the fact that all Presidents before Trump have never lied knowingly or unknowingly.
I see more 1984 in the Left. Nanny State, NSA spying (Obama didnt give a fuck), Controlled / Biased Media and Entertainment industry. Changing the definition of words, cry bully 1+1 = 3 "you're a racist misogynist".

Being an child with no concept of death and dismemberment is VASTLY different than an educated person with a first born 18 month old baby at home along with a woman/man you love.  Also, some men think about their genitalia being blown off.
> I understand where you think your coming from but your so one sided in your arm chair warrior prowess that your off base here.\n\nUseless comment\n\n> I can hardly fathom how you think that's even logical. Either way child soldiers are trained by death threats and or heavily intoxicated if not both in conjunction. Honestly your just not informed on the subject of child soldiers at all. Especially with that backwards stance.\n\nComplete side track response (to my belief that children lack the concept of death.)\n\n> Have you ever heard of the draft, conscripts, or hell even a volunteer based military?\n\nYes, what does that have to do with fear of dying and leaving loved ones to fend for themselves?\n\n> Your just being ridiculous at this point and just undermining your shitty argument..\n\nWow, great argument against REALITIES that some men in the military even think about their dick falling off. \n\nWhen you have a leg to stand on, I am open to being schooled and shutting the fuck up, until then just keep insulting me and maybe Ill move my beliefs.\n\n
My interpretation of the ambiguous comment is that the brake fluid looks 21 years old.

With old GM cars with the engine off, you can turn the mechanical fan by hand, that is the slippage.
If not tires, then maybe all tires should come off for a visual inspection to look for something out of place or abnormal, as the next diagnosis step.

>Honda had produced a Honda RC series six-cylinder race bike in the mid-1960s, but the CBX was Honda's first production 6 cylinder road bike.\n\n...\n\n>Although bulky, the engine was wide only at the top. The width across the crankshaft was relatively narrow as the CBX had a stacked engine ancillary arrangement, whereby the alternator and ignition items were sited behind the cylinder block. This arrangement produced an acceptable engine width low down and moved critical items out of harm's way in the event of grounding.
Always carry a spare cap / rotor (working used) and spare plug wires (working used), along with the tools for the job. For the 4.3 vortec, I also carry a new spare ignition control module in the glove box.
"This is why you don't splice aftermarket remote start systems into the dash harness if you have no clue what you're doing"\n\n[Here is me cutting/splicing BCM wires](http://i.imgur.com/TOkysyj.jpg) for accessory hardwiring, using existing factory wiring to the overhead console and not routing loose wires along trim.
Most likely came from a leak, like weather steipping for the boot, rear windshield, rear doors...etc. This is not normal, probably not even mentioned in the Factory Service Manual unless it was a TSB.
I like how they are humble about not knowing a lot about mechanical work and they will show the pros doing this heavy work and fabrication.
What year is this?!
There are trigger locks on some oil filler guns, maybe the guy started filling then ran to grab the filter, then said fuck it close enough and didn't want to deal with draining the extra out, cause they're amateurs.
So the story is they repaired the spark plug threads and the ford plug had the correct reach?

Looks like it made Cyl 1 egg-shaped, like oblong.
I think it started with gold accents in the engine bay, but the lack of masking caused over spray so then it snowballed into spraying everything down (no need for masking), and even going back to JoAnnes to grab another can of gold paint.

Im okay with metric, I use it in combination with standard almost daily.  For example, providing test engineers at OEMs with GPM flow rates even though I am working to LPM requirements/specs.  I do this because they only use standard flow measurment instruments.\n\nMy problem is people who think Metric is a more accurate measurement system or something.  Base ten is cool, but in custom design you may need a dimension like 55.3 mm, which is 2.177 inches, not sure where base 10 helps out here in my world and my scales [for automotive engineering].  \n\nI get the scaling from small to very large distances is logical, I agree with it.\n\nI have been in automotive development and manufacturing for 12 years now, I see US Metric picking up the transistion in maybe 40 more years, when the 50 yo tradesmen of today have retired and imperial machine tools are worn out and replaced with metric machines.
When I tune my RS, I am going to sand down a few panels to bare metal (to naturally rust) and then Ive got a vintage lamp I will use to dent body panels, it leaves a unique shape everytime.

Tell the Shop you are going on a 1,700 mile trip, they should add it to the notes for techs to acknowledge, top off fluids and inspect your car and tires. \n\nYes get the oil changed now, otherwise you need to get one at the destination, but do you got time for that? How about risk of warranty and liability, the shop at home is close-by at least who knows, for lawsuit shit maybe? Haha, just thinking put loud there dont mean to scare ya.

I have a crazy oil pressure reading in same gen Silverado, google said replace the sender. In my case however, it never hits 0 psi unless off. It is my beater truck, so priority is low on fixing it.
You have a point, 1 single point.  If we pretend Trump never lied, what else is there? The Leftist media and entertainment industry have lied so many times, pushed fake news, and are super ultra biased. Watch a compilation of every major news program saying Trump will never ever ever ever win, never ever, no chance, hahahahahahahaha in the face of Trump actually winning.

Thank you for this I always appreciate a new piece of historical information. While I haven't spent a lot of time reading about Asian atrocities I can say that I will now. \n\nThat said my point was not to say that he was the worst it was to ask why people hold him so accountable and not others? Why is this narrative shoved down our throats but nothing else is even touched upon? Even inside Europe. 
>you're ***already*** a demon Harry!\n\nFTFY
Indeed. Quite a sloppy an unrefined one at that. 
Got to agree with this. Not fair to assume that all men are scary and also not fair to assume all women are afraid of shouty men. I've had boyfriends who shouted at video games before and my wife gets pretty vocal about football that's for sure. Neither is any more scary than the other. One just has a higher voice which is more irritating. There is a difference between frustration and aggression. \n
The Last of Us. By far one of the best games available for the PS4. Especially if you like a good story. 
Hey don't knock sports they're pretty popular haha. I get where you're coming from but isn't a video game just the same? Personally I like a lot of music. Daft Punk have to be my favourite bank though. I'm not a fan of concerts but I know a lot of my friends have met people that way.
Big fucking NOPE there. Stuff of nightmares. 
This is absolute gold. Thank you so much!
Second this. \n\nEveryone is so obsessed with what happened by the hands of the Germans that no one actually talks about what the soviets were doing or what they did to the around 3 million German POWs after WW2 ended and the allies handed them over to the reds.\n\nTheir death numbers were disgustingly higher than that of the people who died in concentration camps and their treatment was far far worse. \n\nLet's not forget about the Berlin wall and the reason it was built. 
I suppose it does look cozy.

I liked Prime but the content you get in the subscription just didn't seem worth it for me. It looks like more because they pretty much bundle all the paid and sub content together. \n\nRight now I have switched to NOW TV. That is worth it for me because I watch more shows than movies. They have a lot of good shows and it is updated frequently.

Well then by your standards it can be said that the Jews deserved it because they forced a boycott upon German exports around the world in 1933 crippling Germany and causing starvation. This was a year before Hitler even came to power. Many of the generals who were in charge of the gulags which killed many millions were Jewish too. Stalins Jewish generals of the NKVD oversaw more deaths in the gulags than any SS Officer in the concentration camps. \n\nCan we say that they deserved concentration camps because of this? \n\n

Truth.
I agree 100%. All these Netflix documentaries are just a way to normalise and to make "truth and conspiracy" a form of entertainment. When Making a murderer was first brought out on Netflix all I could hear around my office was "omg can you believe how corrupt the system is?" bla bla bla. People laughing and joking and acting like they're genuinely annoyed but actually they're just sharing the drama. \n\nWhen Edward Bernays looked at propaganda and realised that it was no longer working and people didn't trust it anymore he changed the face of propaganda. He normalised the press release and public relations side of the news. He created big events or reports for his clients which made the news. People trusted the news and so the news was now a huge outlet for propaganda. \n\nNow that people no longer trust the news we are being given streaming services like Netflix who are creating "new and edgy" documentaries that are telling you the "truth you were never allowed to know before". It is the next step in the evolution of propaganda. \n\nUntil people learn to stop trusting the things they are told and learn to search out knowledge for themselves this pattern will continue. We need to start teaching our children to question everything they're told even if it is frowned upon. \n\nWe know that knowledge is power so why are we allowing it to be spoon fed to us?

Mondo have done some super awesome vinyls.

She looks super duper gay but it is the apocalypse so I'm not sure if stereotypes will be the same in that situation. I'll love the game either way no doubt but I just love it when the protagonist is a lesbian. 
Fun to creepy in seconds.
My wife used to until the day I pointed out that football (soccer) is just a game too. She's super into football so she just kinda got it. Now she plays games with me and I go to football matches (games) with her. Good stuff. I know I got lucky to have a wife who had an interest like that but I get your pain. Video games always take heat from those who don't understand it. I just try to translate the interest into normal terms. She used to hate my figures too (some of which are worth a bit of money) until I asked her what was so special about her mother's porcelain statues of naked Greek women. She likes neither Greeks nor naked women. I like my figures. What makes her random assortment of objects she has no interest in more valid than mine of which I have plenty of interest? Nothing. She then proceeded to purchase me a glass cabinet for them. \n\nTry making her approach it at a mature level and you might get lucky. Breaking stereotypes is really difficult.

We have a communal scanner in the corner of our office. When something is scanned it saves it to a shared file on the network which has hundreds of files in it at one time.\n\nWhen someone is scanning I like to go in and re-name their scans stuff like "INVOICE342" as they scan them and watch their face when the get back to their desk and have no idea where their scans have gone.

I suppose they didn't have that in mind when creating it but it was a very pleasant surprise (for those who's books have worn already). \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XybH2 - What it looks like worn. Credit to u/L-boyontheting\n\nEdit: credit given where due.\n
Won what exactly? He was already in control of his own country and he invaded Poland to take back Danzig because the Germans living there were being persecuted by communists who wanted to drag Germany into a war. He lost that very moment and continued to lose from then on out whether he seemed to win or not. \n\nThe soviet red's had all they wanted and continued to invade countries while the allies were at war with Germany. The allies just chose to ignore them while they raped and pillaged their way through Europe. They even rounded up US nationals and POWs and put them into gulags. These citizens and army heroes were then left to rot by the allies (who were well aware of their existence) after the war was over.  \n\nIf anybody won it was the communists . The allies, although winning on the surface, suffered a deep, penetrating, and persevering subversion which has taken hold of modern society in such a death grip that nobody even knows it is happening.\n

It's hard to say Bitcritic. \n\nHere is a few points to consider. \n\nMost vaccines are made and produced by large Pharmaceutical companies. \n\nBased in the United States, or anywhere globally that they have their manufacturing facilities.\n\nI know that the majority of vaccines in Canada, especially for veterinary uses, are purchased from the United States. Some may be made here in Canada, by Novartis in Ontario, but vets probably get them from their suppliers, which purchase in bulk, from America.\n\nNow it's a tough subject, because we want to make sure our pets are healthy and happy, and with us for as long as possible. \n\nVaccines for animals, have been highly tested on... Well... Animals. With a lot less outcry for animal testing than human testing, you can probably breath easy that your doggie won't have any adverse effects from the vaccine. \n\nIt was probably to ensure they don't get heart worms, or anything funky from drinking stagnant pond water, or eating some parasite invested roadkill. \n\nI don't think there is a nefarious intent to our pets, from vaccines. \n\nI think your doggie will be ok, but do some of your own research! :-) \n
Just air bubbles in the pool. Nothing to see here.
http://imgur.com/JAM2kvZ\n\nSeriously though, I think it's a very very deep rabbit hole, regarding the south pole of our planet. \n\nMaybe aliens, maybe flat earth and it's the outter rim, maybe just a whole bunch of secret military / research bases. No one really knows. \n\nHard to say really. Antarctica is fascinating and fun to theorize about.

Thank you for sharing this. \nI feel like I've known this my entire life. I can't explain how, or why it just seems to make sense when I read more and more about it. It's like remembering something easily. It's really difficult to put into words. 
The fact that you know him that well, and recognize that within him, should be somewhat of a sign to be careful, if you are discussing things with him of this nature.\n\nI know it's frustrating OP. And inside, something may scream at you to want to share the truths you learn, and research, with those that you love and are close to you. The struggle is real.\n\nYou came to learning of these things on your own, but the door was presented to you, and you walked through on your own.\n\nAll you can do, is show them the door, and let them walk-through on their own.\n\n...but showing someone the door, is the real question.\n\nI am thankful I showed my SO the  door. \nI am regretful for ripping away their view of the world, which comforted them so much.\n

I'm sorry in advance if the rabbit hole sucks you in too deep. 
Here's what happened to me. I wrote the piece in 2006, after the majority of what I experienced subsided, due to me not using marijuana anymore. It was a time of reflection and trying to catalogue what I had went through. \n\nTo this day, one hit of THC, and I'm transported right back there. It shakes me to my core. I was completely sober for 10 years, but last year in 2016, I tried it twice, on two separate occasions, with friends out camping. \n\nSure enough. It happens every time.\n\nI am a 28 year old male, born and raised in Canada.\n\nSince a very young age, I have had many adults compliment me on my maturity. "You're very mature for your age, so well spoken!" Time and time again, as far back as 6 years old.\n\nMany times I can recall strangers or friends / acquaintances of my parents stating "Your son is an old soul."\n\nI am a naturally gifted communicator and have been since as young as I can remember.\n\nI've even recalled in one instance, that I was described as being on my last run. This life, being my soul's "last and most important cycle, to learn or experience something never before occurred, in human history."\n\nThat always confused me, because I thought "Well of course... Because no one can predict the future, and everyday is new... So we ALL are experiencing something that has never occurred before... No matter what. It's called "Today".\n\nBut as I have grown and experienced more in this reality, I realize that it is the vibration / frequency of our present and future, that my being wishes to experience and learn from. This is why I am here. Why we all are.\n\nGoing back...\n\nNow why am I beginning my reply like this?\n\nI am not trying to inflate my ego or appear to be more than I am. I am sharing some information about my life experience, in my perceived reality, that has attributed to why I believe there are those of us who achieve a higher vibrational frequency and those who do not.\n\nI am going to share a large bit of writing here, because I feel it is important to share at this moment, seeing this topic pop up.\n\nIt catalogues an event in my life that I believe was a channeling experience. It was from the ages of 15-17 roughly, from 2003-2005. There are many more instances and experiences I have had, but this was the first, and only one I have ever put into the written word.\n\nI have carried this with me for my entire life, and still maintain the ability to access this stream of consciousness. Regardless of what main stream science may say about what I experience, I refuse to accept their labels. I am a very successful individual with a marvelous family, and beautiful partner of 7 years. I earn a very great living and have manifested a position where I can work from home.\n\nI hope I have painted a small picture for you, as I lead into the piece of writing that begins my journey into the world of the occult and hidden truths.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/13Z3ObnseTKytZ2PZJ6HUWpK_BVP255NNxbThAfZEIcY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nEDIT: Adding this link for fun.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SlRsbQ3nfM \nJust going to leave this here.\n\nAnyone denying that the shape of our earth is what they say it is, owes it to themselves to at least watch this. That article is filth. \n\nNot taking this video for 100% truth, but to understand why people have had so many questions in the last few years.\nFact check the points made in that video.\n\nDo your own research, and question everything regarding the globe and NASA. \n\nThe real red pill is hard to swallow.
R/new is where the magic happens. 
When I could no longer contain the passion I had for the truth, and wished to share it with my SO, I was as careful as possible.\n\nAnd even then, I now know I wasn't careful enough. In the end, it boils down to the individual's journey, and spark and passion for truth.\n\nMy SO, born in '89, was a product of Saturday morning cartoons, Disney, and high sugar breakfast cereal.\n\nI had my work cut-out for me.\n\nI began with very disarming questions. Un-biased. Un-loaded. So that my SO's answers came from within, without my influence.\n\nTry and form those questions based on what you are trying to have a discussion about. Whatever truth you are trying to discuss with them. \n\nDo not ask yes or no questions, they have to be open-ended, so that they can form a response. Their response, is their's. It is not something to fight about. The goal, is that they will question their response internally. And perhaps spark a curiosity for them to look into it in their free time.\n\nI don't know how long your journey took you OP, to come to some realizations and some truths. And it may take your SO longer.\n\nWe cannot red-pill someone in a mere conversation.\n\nThe journey is long, and will break down internal walls, that for some, they never come back from.\n\nMy SO, was on the verge of depression, and I can still see them fighting it back, as the comfortable bubble, and veil of reality has been ripped from their reality. \n\nThe question really is, are you willing to break someone, to free them.\n\nIt is an everlasting curse or blessing, to those who have been awakened. It is the individual who deals with these truths, however they see fit.\n\nThat's my two cents, and I wish you both a great happiness in this life.\n
Honestly... Thank you for sharing.\nI wish they taught this in schools. 
Thank you!
I like you.

Eyes. \n\nThey went after him, because of eyes. \n\nMore specifically, he has a platform, where he and his content can influence a large group of viewers. \n\nIt's possible, behind the scenes, he was approached and given the infamous two options. \n\n"Here's a suitcase with money and a script, or here's a suitcase with how we're going to destroy you." \n\nIf he declined such a deal, they would be stupid to put a gun to his head. He's a bit to connected to social media for anything fishy to occur, right now anyways. \n\nTheir attempt to control his content backfired, and he is carefully trying to expose this. For as much as I can't stand the guy, i'll give him the credit of being intelligent enough to protect himself as best as he can. \n\nIt's all about the eyes and the potential influence he has. \n\nTPTB don't like having uncontrolled opposition. \n\nJust my two cents.

One of their questions during the live broadcast, was "Do you know if there is water on these exoplanets". Their answer was a resounding "No." \n\nI don't truly understand how they would be able to detect water, from a black dot passing infront of the star. But hey, I'm not an exoplanet scientist. 
They follow the Rule of St. Benedict\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Saint_Benedict\n\nAn Excerpt for the lazy, of the rule of Saint Benedict, which the TRAPPIST Monks follow:\n\nChapter 7 divides humility into twelve degrees, or steps in the ladder that leads to heaven:(1) Fear God; (2) Subordinate one's will to the will of God; (3) Be obedient to one's superior; (4) Be patient amid hardships; (5) Confess one's sins; (6) Accept the meanest of tasks, and hold oneself as a "worthless workman"; (7) Consider oneself "inferior to all"; (8) Follow examples set by superiors; (9) Do not speak until spoken to; (10) Do not readily laugh; (11) Speak simply and modestly; and (12) Express one's inward humility through bodily posture.\n\n...or you know... maybe it's just named after the Belgian Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope.\n
Just about as far fetched as the OP video! \n\nIt's fun to dig into some of it though. \n\nWatching the OP video in its entirety and digging into its various topics, coupled with stories liked I posted in that link are entertaining to dig into.

I had questions... in March 2015, when I stumbled upon a flat earth video.\n\nShit made me angry. \n\nI couldn't believe people thought or believed the Earth was flat.\nBut I owed it to myself to look into it, instead of dismissing it entirely.\n\nI needed to at least give the information being presented the time of day, and then do my own research and fact checking.\n\nTwo years later, I have questions, that are still... murky in their answers.\n\nHere man, if you honestly have questions about it all, start here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBD7A-OMWyE \n\nThen maybe, watch this one, and chew through the 12 parts:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFYaT-U82JY\n\nJust see what all the noise is about, and then do your own research. It's a fun topic, and shouldn't just be shit on. There's a lot of cool information and at least a few weeks of stuff to ask questions about.

What a time to be alive, eh fellow Eric? 
Nah, I'm just talking about the name. The Devil in the Details.\n\nSure one could say they named the star after the TRAPPIST (Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope)\n\nOr the order of monks who follow the Rule of St. Benedict:\n\nChapter 7 divides humility into twelve degrees, or steps in the ladder that leads to heaven:(1) Fear God; (2) Subordinate one's will to the will of God; (3) Be obedient to one's superior; (4) Be patient amid hardships; (5) Confess one's sins; (6) Accept the meanest of tasks, and hold oneself as a "worthless workman"; (7) Consider oneself "inferior to all"; (8) Follow examples set by superiors; (9) Do not speak until spoken to; (10) Do not readily laugh; (11) Speak simply and modestly; and (12) Express one's inward humility through bodily posture.
I have been seeing more and more of this floating around and popping up in the last several months. \n\nI can't say what is true or what is false, but I can say, that compiling all the anomalies and articles which are guiding the collective human attention towards Antarctica, is for a significant reason.\n\nI believe, and agree, and this is opinion, that they will reveal something earth shaking, that will rock humanity off of its feet, regarding Antarctica. They're polishing this reveal, and running it through think tanks, to analyze how the information will impact the masses. \n\nThese are the infant stages of this reveal, by feeding snipits to the conspiracy community through what I believe are disinformation agents, or shills. \n\nBut my question is this: are they polishing and analyzing the reveal with the intent to mitigate hysteria? Or are they tailoring the information strategically to promote hysteria? \n\nTime will tell, (and I'll be damned if I didn't think its going to be soon) but I believe they are trying to line up more division and separation among us, with current media events, to a certain point statistically, before they make their reveal. The science of group think dynamics has been mastered by the powers that be, and they know exactly how to present information to gain the desired affect on humanity.\n\nAliens, Angels, Atlantis, Maya, Annunaki, giants, nephilim, whatever they want to use to strike fear into the masses, it doesn't matter. \n\nMy money is on ancient aliens as their undertone, but testing, money and resources will be needed to "confirm". A new global focus acheived, pulling the attention away from surfacing damning information against the powers that be. \n\nSure, do I think they'll announce seeding some ancient tech to various groups like space x and such? It only makes sense. Under the guise of human exploration of space, and the potential weaponizing of space using this tech, to protect humanity against the potential and eventual return of these ancient beings. \n\nThere's been enough recent media from Hollywood suggesting as such.\n\nI can't believe I'm living in a time where any or all of this could be true. \n\nStay vigilant brothers and sisters. Don't let the powers that be, separate you.

While I always have a bitter sweet reaction to these "NASA announcements", I don't know if there will be a vault7 connection today. \n\nI'm walking the avenue that TPTB need a distraction right now, for the masses to talk about around the water cooler.\n\n"Did you hear what NASA found? Pretty cool right?" \n\nI don't think their announcement is even going to be that great. But just great enough, for people to be able to discuss it openly in a social setting like work, school, out in public, to move the attention away from a bunch of other controversial topics that are occuring. \n\nIf there's a vault7 connection today?\n\nI'm going to be all over it, just like you! \n\nHave a great day friend. :-)

Yes. \nCanadian here, who by choice, did not want to pay attention to a lot of the political stuff happening in the last 8 months. It was killing my vibe man. \n\nBut from December 2016 to about a week ago, just the start of February 2017, those two months felt like... Hell. \n\nI didn't change anything, my wife felt it to, and I could see the assault on her normally positive and powerful attitude. I could feel this assault on my own outlook and daily routine. Unexplainable, for me really. I have never gone through something like that, so strong. Nor my wife. \n\nBut since about Feb. 2, we've noticed a slight change in just... Tone. That's the best way I can describe it. It's a slight improvement from the last two months, but I don't feel the assault is over. \n\nIt's a strange time indeed, and it sure feels like it's not coming from within, but it is affecting the power within.\n\nFight to stay positive friends, and care for your fellow man and neighbour. \n\nTPTB will never win.

I don't believe it's that we "aren"t allowed to see", it's about "seeing just enough", to push the alien threat/invasion agenda.
I once took a look at the Alien and UFO conspiracy from a different perspective. \n\nI found it odd, that in the past, anyone believing in aliens or UFO's was labelled as crazy.\n\nI found it odd, that more and more movies and TV shows began appearing showing that humans potentially came from alien intervention. Ancient aliens, Prometheus etc. \n\nCoupled with an increase in alien invasion movies. \n \nI began thinking that maybe it was a slow agenda, to make believing in aliens the norm. \n\nAnd when disclosure finally comes, it would be easier for the masses to accept. \n\n...But what if the aliens that we are told about are man made. \n\nWhat if an "invasion" or an "event" that occurs, is a controlled circumstance by TPTB. \n\nWith an intent to unite all humans under one power, one governing body, to fight this new "threat". \n\nJust fun musings. Not serious.\n\n...K maybe a little. 
Huh! Neat! I'll have to try that!
This is a matter of perspective, as with pretty much anything in this reality.\n\nIf you believe that there is nothing beyond what you can see, touch, taste and feel, then sure your position is agreeable.\n\nBut, (and it's a big BUT), the real powers of this earth can't be seen.\n\nIncluding the ones that pull the strings of the figureheads we all love to point fingers at and focus our attention on for this scandal or that. \n\nSecret societies have existed for thousands, not hundreds, but thousands of years. Read some more OP, the truth is out there for you to find.\n\nI do not believe money, greed, and power are the true motives of the real ones in power. \n\nThey are tools, to acheive their goals. They are the exact opposite of peace, love and equality.\n\nThere is GREAT power in love. Just as there is in Fear. \n\nThe real secrets that have been hidden from us, are rooted in that simple concept. \n\nI urge you to try, just try, to view the world from that perspective, trying to identify if the motive behind the message is given to you based in fear or love.\n\nThe occult societies know something, and worship an idea. That idea is rooted in something we cannot see, touch, taste or feel, in this reality.\n

They're polishing this reveal, and running it through think tanks, to analyze how the information will impact the masses. \n\nThese are the infant stages of this reveal, by feeding snipits to the conspiracy community through what I believe are disinformation agents, or shills. \n\nBut my question is this: are they polishing and analyzing the reveal with the intent to mitigate hysteria? Or are they tailoring the information strategically to promote hysteria? \n\nTime will tell, (and I'll be damned if I didn't think its going to be soon) but I believe they are trying to line up more division and separation among us, with current media events, to a certain point statistically, before they make their reveal. The science of group think dynamics has been mastered by the powers that be, and they know exactly how to present information to gain the desired affect on humanity.\n\nAliens, Angels, Atlantis, Maya, Annunaki, giants, nephilim, whatever they want to use to strike fear into the masses, it doesn't matter. \n\nMy money is on ancient aliens as their undertone, but testing, money and resources will be needed to "confirm". A new global focus acheived, pulling the attention away from surfacing damning information against the powers that be. \n\nSure, do I think they'll announce seeding some ancient tech to various groups like space x and such? It only makes sense. Under the guise of human exploration of space, and the potential weaponizing of space using this tech, to protect humanity against the potential and eventual return of these ancient beings. \n\nThere's been enough recent media from Hollywood suggesting as such.\n\nI can't believe I'm living in a time where any or all of this could be true. \n\nStay vigilant brothers and sisters. Don't let the powers that be, separate you.\n\n
I just wanted to say thank you for this amazing reply. \n\nAnd thank you for the included links.\n\nWe have so much to learn in a sea of disinformation, and I agree with a lot of your points about reality and conjecture. \n\nSincerely thank you for this. I'm happy to know I'm not alone in thinking a certain way and trying to decipher for myself what the truth is. \n\nSeriously wish I could have contact with individuals like you in daily life. \n 
They never left.

Lol I was mostly kidding. We don't know what those are. Hell we don't even know if that was the ISS. "But it was on the live feed NASA YouTube channel!" ... Yep. Sure was. Wrap it up folks, NASA showed us UFO's, they must be real. \n\nThere's also been a lot of these NASA cuts video feed because of weird object popping up lately. \n\nI think it's a strange narrative they're trying to present to everyone. \n\nAliens might just be a man made device to unify the world governments into fighting a new otherworldly presence. \n\nBut that's just me. 
Thank you for this. 
Hey man.\n\nI'm 28 years old, and also Canadian. \n\nI've been where you are. \n\nLearning the world and society and systems in place to keep you and the vast majority below an invisible line, can be confusing. And terrifying. And depressing. \n\nIt can, and is made to shatter you. It's built to crush you spiritually. \n\nDon't let it. \nDo not let them win. \n\nFor those who seek power, and greed, and try to acheive such things by breaking the spirits of others are the ones who will "go to hell". \n\nYou're not going to hell.\n\nYou're learning about the real evils in this world.\n\nThe real evil, is the lack of love. \n\nLove yourself, and love your friends, and your family, and what you have in your life. \n\nWalk around and go about your daily life with a sense of gratitude and thankfulness. Literally, say "thank you" inside your head, for the smallest things. \n\nLike, are your pajamas warm and comfortable? Smile and just say thank you, and enjoy that feeling. \n\nWas the glass of water you drank cold and just perfectly refreshing? Say thank you. \n\nNot to anyone or thing in particular, but for you. Do it for yourself. \n\nYou are only truly going to know and love and trust three important people in your life. \n\nSay thank you to past you, for getting you here. For making the mistakes that past you did, so you can learn from them now. Past you did you a lot of favors. You're living those rewards now. Past you also gave you drive and motivation to seek answers and ask questions. Say thanks to past you for that.\n\nBut don't give up on Future you. \nDo favors for future you. He's waiting for you, and hoping and dreaming that you'll do the things he wished he could have. Do HUGE favors for future you. \nPrepare some meals for him ahead of time, like a couple days. Learn to cook more and more amazing dishes for him. \n\nWorkout a bit, do some crunches and push-ups, for future you. \n\nGo hiking, and take pictures for future you to look at, and be inspired by the beauty you saw that day on the trail.\n\nSoon, you will be thanking past you for all the favors he did for you. \n\nBecause he loves you.\n\nAlways realize, that future YOU, is remembering you right now, through a memory. Let that sink in. \n\nDo your absolute best to make sure it's a great and loving memory. \n\nDon't let this game of life ruin that love for yourself man. That's what this system is meant to destroy. Dont let them take that away from you.\n\nI'm not about to let them win. \n\nAre you? \n\nIf you ever need to talk, or share, PM me, from one Canuck to another, I got you fam.\n Edit: a word.

I'm afraid they are here to stay...  \nunlike CTR, they actually believe their own BS, and don't disappear when the funds run out...  \n\nunrelated but nice [Abstruse Goose](http://abstrusegoose.com/347) i had to think of...
wow, where do you get all that info?
More specifically, I don't  like his political stands so far, but thanks for checking my profile before assuming anything, that's a step further into fact checking than most . :-D
than they would be protecting something even more damning/valuable than that?...   \ncoz that would only work, if at least part of the LH would be true...   \n\n\ni may lack imagination, but that seems far fetched.  \n\n
What's up with all these recent obvious spam posts here?  \ni mean, if they were at least trying to be subtle?!?
if you are on a desktop/laptop, hover your mouse over the "1 hour ago" line. it gives you the exact timestamp.  \n\nfor me the posts are three seconds apart, the 3mil voter bot being later...  (Tue Feb 21 07:25:05/8 2017 UTC)\n
did you actually read all of the 500k messages?!?  \n\ni just put the file into an excel, so i can filter the stuff. took me a while. trying to isolate pager numbers via your graph... now. might take me a few days. lots of the messages look cut off... guess pagers operate UDP ;-)\n\nPS: oh look, someone already uploaded them: https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?dsrcid=1039804
if it was a witch hunt against a single person, people would be attacking primarily the person. taken aside some obvious trolls and other idiots, that is not what's happening.  \nthe primary attack vector on Trump are his decisions, his political stands, and the results thereof.

if it gets any darker than that, i return to watching saturday morning cartoons and getting my news from the muppet show... singing happy tunes while clapping my hands.  \ni really hope that this is rock bottom already.
wow. coooool!  \n\nbut it has to be an artifact... i mean, the energies needed to get that signal across those distances, for this kind of crisp signal are unimaginable...  \n\nMaine is really weird!!!

Yes he does, Nicole Kidman naked. :-D ;-)
Yes, if at the same time you have the official WL account acknowledging you *and* wait for the cat to randomly tweet out an image you can use as a correctly formatted wallpaper.  \n\nYes, I did think about it.
I thought the current theory was, that he can't read beyond 4th grader level? ;-)
the "From:" and the "Reply-To:" field in email headers are distinct.  \nmost people only check the "From:" before hitting reply and then don't check again before sending

Doesn't really fit with the mindset. He was the one issuing the order to destroy the rest of Germany to prevent it falling in enemy hands. He was the one thinking, that the country failed him for not winning the war. He was the one handing out nonsensical orders to non-existing units in the east...  \nHe wasn't Göring. It just doesn't fit.
not soon. he is too useful as a distraction target. kind of like an ablative meat shield. he will be used for this specific purpose if and only if needed.  \n\nso, hard to predict.  \n\ni'd say late april. last week of it.

**half life** of 8 days...  \nnot total life (which doesn't exist)  \n\ni.e. at day zero there are (let's say) 1kg released  \nat day 8, 500g are left.  \nat day 16, 250g are left.  \nat day 24, 125g are left.  \nafter 1 month, 62.5g are left... so, right now, ~5% of the initially release iodine is still around. that should be enough for reasonably expensive measurement equipment.
Disagree. It's actually worse that we humans are capable of doing this (allegedly), "aliens-made-me-do-it" excuse would be weaker.
yeeeees, are the CTR guys on extended 4-year vacation? or only doing part time now?
what is specifically angering are the assholes who did not report that leak. there just *has* to be someone who knows about it.  \n\nwere you told not to go to the playground then, too? and didn't you understand it either? i still remember seeing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_RtTHRkJIY) german kids show about it (1988. in german)

In Germany it is mandatory to have an ID card (Personalausweis), persons of age 16+. The new version has an RFID chip in it - optional as of yet, but it is based on opt-out, you have to know when to tell them to deactivate the feature. And it doesn't actually remove the chip itself.

pretty much this.  \nwe can only hope, that the more people are working in the chinese room, the higher the probability is, that one of them actually understands chinese...  \nsince it is all in english, it should happen sooner or later.
So far, yes.  \nBut remember: we need sources, too.  \n\nNone of us are investigative journalists (the 'classical' ones). We rely on others doing the footwork...  \n\nMost of what we are discussing is at one point somewhere out on the media; sometimes buried in the small print of the traditional MSM, sometimes in official releases, sometimes on the fringes of trustworthyness, and - recently - in leaks.   \n\nSo far, so good, but the tighter the control gets, the less true ~~inflation~~ information reaches here...  \n\nEdit: I hate autocorrect

If serious, that is a pointless question.  \n\nWe had this as a joke "conspiracy" in Germany in the '90s - the Bielefeld conspiracy.  \nPeople starting asking around whether anyone present could claim to have been in the city of Bielefeld, or knew someone.  \nWhen none made that claim for a short while, it was agreed that Bielefeld didn't exist, and anyone coming later claiming to know better was either duped or "one of them"...  \n\nIt was a quirky little joke, but the principle works here too...

it is not about the *amounts* that were found, which are minute, and very well under any alarming threshold, it is about the *type* of radionucleide that is found.  \n\nthat particular isotope, Iodine-131, has a few striking properties:  \n- it is very short lived, so if it is found, it is recent  \n- it is known to be released in quantities during critical reactor failures and/or found after nuclear explosions  \n\nso, there are two known sources for it, both in the concerning to very concerning variety.  \n\nthe lesser problem would be an underground nuclear bomb test, which would just be a treaty violation, the other one would be another major reactor failure...   \n\n~~if you find a more benign explanation, please tell us.~~\n\nEDIT: TIL: there is a 'benign' explanation: https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/source-iodine-131-europe-identified that was a similar incident in 2011, when a supplier for medical equipment leaked that stuff...  \nso there is hope :)

the images are fine, blurry and no persons visible, only background, dark...  \nthe sounds are not for the faint of heart, though.  \nPS: i have ssen **only the four** videos mentioned in the OP post, there are apparently more. unsure about those!**\n\nif you have to ask this question, do not listen to those videos!  \n\nhonest opinion, not trolling.
So, uhm... Racial purity and genocide for mixed raced couples is fine for monkeys...?  \nCan we put everyone advocating that kind of crap in charge of zoos, so they can live out their fantasies and leave it out of our society?
And this: \n\nSkull and Bones member Judge James E. Boasberg Described As One of 7 Rising Star Judges You Want To Clerk For. Judge Boasberg ruled that the public had no right to view government photos of a deceased Osama Bin Laden.\n\nSUPRISE! 
These are the same emails from Wiener's laptop that Comey's team sufficiently vetted a mere week before the election to say ah, false alarm on that T-7 days reopening of the case...? Wrongdoing we can clear in a week, privacy+bullshit will take us 5 years?
They all work together.
And also this: \n\nA federal judge denied a request by two tribes for a temporary restraining order to stop the building of the Dakota Access pipeline, finding there was no immediate irreparable harm to the tribes if construction continues.\n\nJudge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., said he was not ruling on whether the pipeline is "a good or bad idea," but on whether its continued construction would cause "imminent harm."
"Master of Studies" sounds like such a ridiculous degree. Like, I mastered studying! Yay for me! lol
The judge wants to live 
We should demand to see those emails. But first we can demand Trump's tax returns. But don't expect Trump to ever let this Zimmerman telegram out of his tiny hands.   
Horse shit.  Hopefully they can appeal.
Too many nimble navigators out here -- they probably don't even know/get half of what they are sitting on

*Wouldn't it be better to demand a red herring?*
Drain the Swamp!
Explain to me why The State Department was emailing each other about how they needed to get rid of evidence, as explained in the WikiLeaks?\n\nExplain why Hillary went to such great lengths to wipe her hard drive even after being subpoenaed by congress\n\nThese are not things innocent people do. These are things extremely guilty people do who know they broke major laws.\n\nALL of the evidence is on the Datto Node that the FBI will not hand over. Datto said they gave it to the FBI so they have it. Hillary wiped her hardrive but all emails still stored on Dattos servers. James Comey was corrupted and bribed by Hillary. So sick of damn near everyone in our government being so corrupt
Their own guy comey already admitted to the wrong doings. And their other guy mccabe says "5 years" when it took em days for comparable numbers. \n\nIsnt it weird how 5 years to read clintons 650k emails with such a budget, how it seems to land after the next election? Sweep sweep sweep. \n\nAs comey's done for bill's friend marc rich. Delay delay, find no wrongdoing, no evidence, pay fine.
ваша отсталость привела вас к вопиющей глупости
We already know from the Prank Call he's willing to call up foreign leaders behind Trumps back and low key shit talk him\n\nHe needs to go
Well you didn't debunk anything. Sweden has a sexual assault problem. Its well documented. I don't care what some liberal Sociologist professor says otherwise about it. They are having issues with their Muslim population. Its all over the internet if you so choose to actually know the truth. \n\nAs for the current Hildawg investo I don't know how its going. The Oversight Committee said they didn't want to leak information until the investigation is complete because theres so much information that "What they find today could be disproven tomorrow" or something like that.\n\nI wouldn't get too cocky about Hillarys investigation bud! Obviously she broke laws. Lynch didn't meet with Bill on the tarmac for no reason. The State Department isn't being uncooperative for no reason. Hillary had Top Secret information on an account that was accessible to people who aren't qualified to have that information. She had TS information on her private server that could have easily been hacked by anyone. This is the first investigation taking place under the new administration. No more Mrs Lynch to cover Hillarys ass. No more Obama to cover her ass. \n\nOH AND BEFORE I GO, Here is a Swedish Electrical Company that will be pulling out of refugee/Muslim areas because they fear for their workers safety LMFAO And its straight from their own facebook https://www.facebook.com/hogselab/posts/1621481224533400
I believe he said the reason he was able to come out was because he was close to retiring anyways. A go fund me page is cool but I'm pretty sure he's financially stable
If The Donald is SO weak then how come YOU, part of/colluding with an Internet Marketing Agency, is having to attack them every day now?\n\nI seen your sub reddit yesterday. There was nobody in it except for YOU posting a bunch of shell articles and then power voting the one you wanted on r/all with your shill accounts\n\nAgain, your plans will fail. Didn't work in 2016 wont work in the future. If anything these internet campaigns backfire
Both of their candidates suck ass \nLasso is a Banker who is OK with Julian being killed which is perdy bad. Assange is nothing but a truth teller
\n\nDoes anybody have the unedited version? I just don't think he can recover either way.
You LITERALLY linked me a BBC article that says "Is it true? Yes. The Swedish police recorded the highest number of offences - about 63 per 100,000 inhabitants - of any force in Europe, in 2010. The second-highest in the world."\n\nLOL. You said idiots claim Sweden is the rape capital of Europe.........well if you don't want people to say that then I would suggest you.........don't link them to articles that say Sweden is the rape capital of Europe
Not clicking a link titled "Cuck Cam"
THIS WOULD BE EPIC. Kill the Russian Narrative 
When Reddit began colluding with ShareBlue and CTR aka leftist political brainwashing machines\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/n6o0e35sn5gy.png
You should be more afraid of the ridiculous flooding of migrants into your country that have slaughtered your fellow Frenchmen on numerous occasions. \n\nYou should be afraid that your own government is so aware that the people they are letting in are dangerous that they are bulletproof glassing the Eiffel Tower\n\nLe Pen is the last thing you should be afraid of.
Boat there. I road a boat to the island before\n\nAnd in the winter snowmobiles or straight drive a truck over the ice
You can read these: http://www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com/ and NOT be concerned?\n\nHillary will run again in 2020. It is extremely important her corruption is not just swept under the rug. She is easily the most corrupt politician we have seen and that's without even having been President yet. Imagine how corrupt she would be with nobody there to stop her
Pray for Trey Gowdy and the Oversight Committee. They are trying their hardest to lock her up. They know she deserves it. You can tell Trey has a personal vendetta to get Justice for the Americans who died in Benghazi
The kinkiest girls always have dirty feets
Sweden actually does have the most rapes in Europe per 100,000 and was 2nd in the world. But keep in mind many countries don't keep good track. I'm sure Syria, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Africa etc etc actually have more \n\nThose numbers for Sweden have certainly gotten worse since more refugees were added. ALSO there IS a big problem with Sweden government and media hiding crimes committed by refugees. They do it because they don't want backlash from the public. One Swedish police officer, Peter Springare, is making waves across Sweden because he actually took a stand against the cover ups that have been going on and is starting to post about it on Facebook\n\nSpeaking of Facebook two refugees in Sweden just got arrested for Facebook Live streaming a rape of a lady. Oh and Swedish Courts just allowed a Muslim man to marry a pregnant 14 year old girl because of cultural customs\n\nI could go on all day about this but you guys will never get it. A religion that treats women as lesser humans is going to have more sexual assaults. That's just common sense
This implications are fucking massive\n\nIf Lenin doesn't get 40% with 10% victory over Lasso then JulianAssange  is most likely losing his asylum. Which Julian is not going down without releasing his information.
Starts at 7:05 Mark\n\nSupposedly the 14 year old boy impregnated her twice. Bill Defends it. He even points out the boy was younger when their relationship started
The medias power is no joke. Milo loses everything he worked for because the media collectively attacked him. Maher and Takei? Pfft they wont lose a single thing because the media will ignore it
I've thought of starting a chat off site where we can coordinate better. Compete with Shareblue basically. Coordinate each day a single thread we want on r/all\n\nWe couldn't get spammy with it or reddit would shut everything down though
I posted about this in Conspiracy \n\nMoreno Lenin said he would allow Assange to keep his asylum. Then JOHN KERRY pressured Lenin into shutting Assange up via gag order\n\nLenin agreed and notified Assange. Now watch as Lenin mysteriously wins.\n\nBUT Its a lose lose either way. Lenin win=Assange is gaged which Assange wont stay quiet. Lasso win=Assange loses aysulm
And a shit ton of refugees too!\n\nLiving in Michigan I hear a new story everyday about some group braving the cold winter to run into Canada. Yesterday there was some story about them outrunning border patrol
Realistically OF COURSE\nHe has the globalist elite and the CIA wanting him out of the White House. These are some of the most evil people on earth. They'll start a war that results in the death of millions just to get some oil 
https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/terror-2016.htm\n\nHere's a list of some of the terrorist attacks Muslims committed just from January 2016-to mid July 2016. That's an incomplete list yet it'd take you hours to read through\n\nWhen you can compile a list of that size of any other religions terrorist attacks then sure you can start to also deem that religion as bad as Islam. You would have a hard time finding a list 1/100th that size for the same 6 month period for Christians or Jews\n\nI am so sorry you are too stupid to see Islam is a cancerous death cult
....
Just call it the CIA Post\n\nWe should make that a trend so it catches on like Fake News and CNN. This way regular Americans are aware of Bezos/WaPo 600 million dollar contract with the CIA
Google did this with "Clintons" too. On Bing and DuckduckGo is will suggest "Clintons-Bodycount". On Google it will just say nice things about her\n\nGoogle is scum now. I use Bing
They are working on both. Oversight Committee ordered all emails and data node by the FBI feb 10th. Of course the FBI is yet to provide the data node that server company Datto says they gave them which contains...........everything. Basically the FBI is corrupt covering up\n\nHillary thought wiping her computer would erase everything but it was still stored on the node at Datto. FBI has the node though
Is it odd that I'm a Trump supporter yet I'm pretty sure I've never looked at a single Breitbart article?
What does it matter? Reddit is working with them. Not like they will get in trouble or something
No not at all. Lenin needs 40% of the vote. He's at 39.05% with 85% of votes counted. He was in the 38% since like 60% of votes counted so its moving up super slow\n\nIts going to be HELLA CLOSE. I don't think he makes it which means it goes to the runoff election April 2 which is just Lenin vs Lasso. Julian Assange himself said Lasso would win the runoff election
I'm still donating monthly to Bob Doles Campaign. I promise you he'll make a come back

Talking about women as if they are objects? \n\nDemocrats lost the right to act like they care about women the minute they started supporting Islam. Trump may talk about grabbing a pussy but the people you guys support will behead a women for not having sex when asked to
I wish what Trump would do is just target even ONE large black city and try to improve it noticeably.\n\nDemocrats haven't ever fixed any of the black majority cities that are in shambles. From Detroit, to Flint, to Gary, New Orleans, to ghetto Chicago areas, St louis areas, etc etc. If Trump could fix one, maybe by getting a large facctory to move there or something, he could totally win over more black voters while also showing their cities CAN be fixed
He wont be able to prove Trumps corruption but here's .01% of Hillary's corruption\n\nHillary Clinton recieved donations from countries she knew supported ISIS\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5469\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828\n\nHillary took money from foriengers for her campaign which is illegal\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2783\n\nKing of Morocco have Clinton Foundation 12 million dollars. 6 months later Morocco recieved weapons\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22030\nhttps://i.sli.mg/JaZnPl.jpg\nhttp://www.army-technology.com/news/newsus-approves-157m-tow-missile-system-sale-to-morocco-4736092\n\n\nState Department tried to bribe FBI over Email Scandal\n\nhttps://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view\nhttp://nypost.com/2016/10/17/state-department-brokered-deal-with-fbi-to-declassify-clinton-emails/\n\n\nHillary caught on tape talking about rigging Palestine election\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-30899546/hrc-determine-who-win-1\n\nBill Clinton recieved a $1 million gift from Qatar.

This only has 38,000 views on YouTube. Lets show this guy some support for making one of the best Presidential parody videos ever.
The god dam irony in a leftist talking about fact checking. When your side produces CNN, NBC, MSNBC, Huff Post, and ABC you don't get to talk down on others on the subject of fact checking\n\nYour side LIVES off of "Anonymous sources" and BREAKING NEWS that is debunked the following week
Dude........stop being a pussy\n\nWhat American Male has never said something about grabbing a girls ass or something of that manner? Pretty much everyone has. Sorry if Trump is too normal for you
Any none Muslim who supports Islam has no knowledge of Islam. That simple. \n\nYou cant support women and Gay rights while also supporting Islam. This is what shows Democrats ignorance and true colors.  Its punishable by death in 10 Islamic countries to be homosexual. Illegal in most others. Sharia Law in many Islamic countries allows for public beheadings of women for simple shit like refusing sex. Stoning of women isn't uncommon. Throwing gays off of roofs. And I mean you can just simply look at Islamic countries and see they are hell holes and have been for 1000+ years
Did ya watch the video moron?\n\nThere is no explanation he can give to make what he said sound alright. No matter how much he says it was taken out of context he literally argued it was ok for older men to have sex with 13 year old boys.\n\nSticking up for a guy who is on camera debating in favor of pedophilia is worse than anything ShareBlue can do\n\nI'm informing people of what just happened to one of the most loved "Fags" on this subreddit so they know what to expect when its brought up, which it will be A LOT\n
Free IDs would be a great compromise!\n\nBUT For some reason I think Democrats would turn that offer down
He redpilled that guy and the mod seen it so they censored him\n\nThe left is really pathetic. They feel the need to widespread censor the right all across the internet
Him and Gowdy are a super team
Its because their readers are racists and enjoy reading articles that demonize white people
Are you saying this is fake?\n\nIt was reported by Stockholms own News Twitter handle as well \n\nSMH Denial
Were da whyte womenz at?
Hopefully he is planning to mainly address the issue of the media and police force hiding crimes by migrants mainly sexual assaults\n\nHe isn't likely to go there for a week and see some middle eastern like warzone or something. I'm not sure how he's going to investigate police covering up migrant crime\n\nI think this backfires
Its not confirmed they hacked the DNC! Again WHERE IS THE PROOF? If there's one thing I've learned this year its to not believe anything without proof.\n\nJulian Assange himself has said his source for obtaining the E-Mails WAS NOT Russia or any State Party. \nHe said he never gives information as to who a source is and he prides himself on after 10 years never having a single source found but he said he was forced to come out and state it was not Russians because of the implications involved.\n\nSorry, but I'm going to believe Julian Assange, the man who prides himself on the truth, over the likes of our IC.\n\nI'm Glad her Emails were leaked and you should be too. It opened many Americans eyes to the hidden corruption going on in the US government. Hillary ccepting bribes to supply other countries with weapons, the DNC rigging the elections against Bernie, Obama knowing about Hillarys private server which is HUGE, Hillary accepting money from countries that support ISIS, The state covering up the emails, Colluding with Mainstream Media, Podesta being a pedophile, the DNCs epic use of racial slurs, their shit talking about Catholics, etc etc. Just read them. THANK GOD Hillary did not win. She is by far the most corrupt devil we've ever had in US politics and she did all this before even getting into the WH\nhttp://www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com/
I think that's the entire point of the article. They allege Trumps lawyer handed off a plan for peace between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWell, if the sanctions were placed because of unrest between Russia and Ukraine then I think peace between Russia and Ukraine would warrant the sanctions being lifted, right? Right
Typical Liberal. He says like "You know the website blacksfortrump2020 is owned by a White Nationalist, I don't have proof but you know its true"\n\nMotherfucker, how does one live like that? Fucking aye between the fake media and their own lies they just live in a damn fantasyland
Pizzagate is a conspiracy. Milos video is not a conspiracy, obviously. Got it? Is it really that hard to understand? \n\nAnd I think some Pizzagate threads need to be deleted as well. Every time theres a pedophile bust somewhere in the world it doesn't need to be posted about here unless there is a direct connection to Pizzagate. 
I wouldn't if I was her base.\n1. Support a lady who didn't pay some money\nor\n2. Continue letting my country be pillaged by migrants\n\nPretty easy choice there
He needs 40% though. A lead means nothing if he doesn't get 40%
Lenin looks like he will win. He is leading 4/5 early exit polls. Which is good its Lasso who would end JA's asylum\n\nYou can stay updated by following WikiLeaks/Julian Assanges twitter. I'm sure he'll know the winner before anyone ;)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulianAssange
To play devils advocate\n\nShareblue is backed by George Soros who is richer than any person funding anything Trump related. Soros is known to not just stop at a little manipulation he'll fund riots and bail rioters out of jails....and that's just what he does on his off days ;)\n\nGlobalists are VS Donald Trump considering Trumps policies are pretty much the opposite of theirs. Globalists tend to be the wealthiest people on earth. Like the Zuckerbergs, Soros, Gates, Slims, etc etc. Also against Trump: Reddit, Google, Facebook, Twitter, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, Huffington Post, Yahoo, Washington Post, New York Times, Guardian, etc etc etc. Companies like Google and Facebook might just seem like a search engine and a social media platform but they are also data machines. Oh and lets not forget..............Our own CIA is potentially against him\n\nSo I mean are we really going to act like Breaitbartlol and their analytics company are even in the same ballpark compared to what Trump is against? Its basically Trump against the World right now\n
Provide proof Trump is a rapist\n\nAs for Islam I'm not trying to gain moral high ground. I'm just saying you cant support Islam while also supporting women. If you think you can then your knowledge about Islam is literally nothing. Its like supporting black rights while supporting the KKK
Make sure to adds yesterdays AP article titled "Trump Admin May deploy 100,000 national guard soldiers to round up illegals"\n\nLOL What a fear mongering article
He'll pass his empire on to his son Alex who is already in the US at Berkley starting riots\n\nIt doesn't make sense. They are just evil. Something just clicks in billionaires heads that makes them want to control the earth. God complex
Exactly what Milo says?!?!?\n\nBill Maher said it was okay that a 14 year old impregnated a 35 year old. Bill Maher took it 20 steps further than Milo did
LOL Look at this pants though
Flynn was cleared by the FBI for any wrong doing. There's no evidence of Russians hacking the elections. \nAnd the most ironic part is before the election Democrats were the ones saying there was no way for the elections to be hacked but after Trump one they say it must've happened\n\nPeople will start believing the Russian Trump theory when there's any evidence for it. All we have right now is the MSM jumping on any Russia Trump connection they can find and then a week later.....every single time.....its proven nothing illegal happened\n\n
Leave it up to a fucking retarded ass Liberal to think its a good idea to release a man whose face is covered in Gang Tattoos. Brown, did you really think this thug was going to be able to get a job and become a productive member of society?
Do you have the link to the unedited version? \n\nThis is a very touchy situation. We have to be careful ourselves.  
Jeff Flake who has distanced himself from Pence ever since Pence started supporting Trump. They don't really seem like BFs anymore. Flake has blown Pence off for a year now
14 year old girl: http://vesselnews.io/swedish-judge-upholds-marriage-pregnant-14-year-old-child-bride-syria-cousin/\n\nFor the "Sweden is the rape capital of Europe, 2nd highest rapes in the world" you can look at your buddies 3rd link from the BBC\n\nThe  Swedish Police Officer speaking out: http://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post\n\nAND GUESS WHAT? He was investigated for a Hate Crime all because he gave his first hand experience about the crime he experiences as a police officer. And ya wonder why Swedes are scared to speak up about this problem? Because if they do they immediately face legal action\n\nPeter Singleare is a Hero. Swedes shouldn't be afraid to speak up to the invasion taking place in their country
LMFAO I place a MASSIVE list of Muslim terror attacks that you can easily fucking google any of them and find true yet you say its false. And the funny thing is you don't believe that list which is incomplete when the real list including all attacks would be even bigger. The list is 100% true but even if its only 1/10th true its still one gigantic ass list.\n\nSeriously buddy? That's how you are going to live your life? Just one big fucking life of denial even with the facts right in front of you?\nYou are so fucking stupid you wont believe Islam is bad until they are beheading you and raping your wife. smh Dumbass infidel
In the video he was talking about a 13 year old boy. In his explanation he was talking about himself at 17. Consent laws in UK I believe are 16 which makes HIS situation OK but again he argued about age 13 in the video. Seriously the video is creepy saying like its OK for older men to help 13 year olds who are gay feel comfortable or some shit. \n\nEven IF his explanation is "Adequate" somehow, the MSM will spread it like wildfire that he is a Pedophile and it will be too much baggage 
Its not the Democrats we are worrying about. Its the CIA. They've done it before and they'd do it again. I am genuinely worried about it
um yes I think its pretty obvious Milo is not related to Pizzagate. Pizzagate is US politicians and human traffickers neither of which is Milo. lol what the fuck no wonder the subs going down hill just a bunch of fucking idiots
OH MAN!!!!!!!!!\n\nBro you cant bring up corruption scandals against Trump when Hillary the queen of scandals was his opponent\n\nShe has been under investigations for corruption like her entire life. The Clintons have a damn BODY COUNT list online of potential people they've killed. Nobody is more corrupt than Clinton. Trump has a bunch of made up Russian Corruption Ties that have no evidence backing them except for some fake Dossier
And I bet 95% of Swedes never even knew this happened
Translated to English:\nRioting and plundering in Rinkeby, the police have fired warning shots \n\n•The police who were supposed to apprehend the wanted men were exposed to stones being thrown at them and were forced to fire off warning shots. \n\n\n•Multiple cars have ben set a flame, shops are being plundered. Police and fire department establish a breaking point. \n\n\n•Hundreds of police are sent of to the migrant populated suburbs. "We will make sure that order is set back in place" \n\n\nLars Byström Stockholms police - "The event began at 20:18, where the police arrested a man by the train station in Rinkeby. Then a dozen people appear and start throwing rocks at the police. The police feel threatened and fire off a warning shot. A police gets hit in the arm by a rock and his condition is uncertain" \n\n•The worries have continued throughout the night and are classed as violence against officials and violent rioting. At 21:50 the police announce that at least one car has started to burn. \n\n\n•Pictures from the place show that multiple cars are engulfed in flames. Stockholm fire department don't want to answer questions regarding the extent of the fire. \n\n\n•At 22:20 another violent riot arises when 30-40 people go to attack against the police including rock throwing. No one should've been harmed during the riot. \n\n\n•A large police force of hundred men have been reported standing by in Rinkeby and are ready to respond to any events. \n\n
What is it good or bad? I thought it sounded bad
Does anybody want to explain how Milos video is related to anything about Conspiracies?\n\nThis subreddit needs to be cleaned up. Its starting to be cluttered with too much shit that is in no way related to any sort of conspiracy
mmmmhhhmmmmm How much for the Vicodin?
lol I live in Michigan. Our refugees are fucking walking through 10 degree weather to cross into your country. Good luck in the summer. Trudeau really hates you guys
I just find it funny how after the speech I seen all these articles claiming "Trump said a Terrorist attack happened in Sweden last night"\n\nI rewatched the speech and didn't see anywhere he mentioned a "terror attack" because........he never said there was a terror attack\n\nThese leftist idiots are REALLY grasping at straws here
I mean if someone was giving me tens of millions for.........nothing, considering Brocks plans are failures, I might think he was awesome too
I don't know what "200 hours of media" implies
Its in Albequerque now\n\nSome black guy was flashing a pistol on it earlier
Foreign media demonizes Trump as bad as CNN except foreigners have few ways to see the actual truth about Trump. A Trump related campaign would backfire. Ask a European on a different sub what they hear about Trump in their news. They'll tell you he's destroying America according to their media
If the cuck cam stayed there any longer Soros would have had to start busing in "protesters"
EXACTLY if they had blackmail on Trump especially a pedo video it'd be outted\n\nThis attempt by leftists to drag Trump into Pizzagate is SAD. No evidence other than he hung out with Epstein before and he said he was a great guy which Trump says about everybody\n\nHe cut off ties immediately when Epstein was found out.

You could've went a little harder than that. Islam is worse than just "Not as good of a culture". They are an immediate threat to all of western civilization. Like a cancer slowly spreading. They will achieve their goals by simple immigration with violence to follow or violence upfront. Anywhere Islam goes bombings, beheadings, mutilation, and loss of freedoms always follow.

I always wanted to see an Island Settlement. The Survivors there would obviously be safe from any zombies but would still have to go to the mainland to get supplies. This would also prevent large groups of baddies such as Negans army from all attacking at once.\n\nIMO the perfect Safe Zone in the US would be Mackinaw Island, Michigan. Large Island with older and newer style homes, Forests, literal forts from like the 1800s, shops, docks, airport etc. 
Naw dude they straight up ignore it ALL\n\nHad a guy in ETS last night tell me "Dumbasses keep spewing the myth that Sweden is the rape capital of Europe"\n\nHe posted a source "Debunking it" and in the BBC source HE POSTED it literally said 'Sweden led Europe in rapes and was 2nd in the world"\n\nThey are THAT fucking stupid. They simply don't want to believe Muslims culture is horrendous. Its going to take some serious violence for them to learn.

Just so you guys know though Assange does not like Trump\n\nJust yesterday he posted "Sweden went full 'Trump'" Using Trump instead of Retard\n\nJust last night he also basically said "What could go wrong with Trump in power" in an obvious sarcastic tone\n\nJust yesterday he blamed Trump for "Indefinite Detention without charges" even though that was Obamas bill\n\nSo although Assange is great don't think he's like on Team Trump. The US is the main reason Assange is stuck in the embassy. If he leaves then Sweden will arrest him, Sweden said they would extradict Assange to the US, and the US is still weighing espionage charges against him which would equal death or life in prison.
that look he gave his secret service when he said that, that was a "I toadaso" type look
They Breitbarted the poor bastard
Seriously though, before it was cool to say Obama did ISIS, was it not immediately obvious -- even to the most cucked -- that sending weapons to "moderate rebels" was the dumbest fucking foreign policy decision ever?  As soon as I heard that I knew everything in the Media regarding Assad was probably completely made up.  You are going to arm Islamic militants because they *told* your operatives they are moderate?  Who the fuck sends weapons to a group labeled as nebulously as "moderate rebels"?  I know good conservative folks that still think we are on the right side of the Syria conflict... sad.
Then how are you parroting this "alternative facts" nonsense?  Try to consume information from as many places as possible.  It is sad that the divide in Reddit has become so large that what you get is propaganda from both sides.
Unless the information comes across their facebook feed most people don't know about it.  We live in an age of narcissism, where people can insulate their narrow, shallow worldview witch echo chambers they can create themselves.

If think 2008 scared a bunch of Millennials in to being liberal, wanting big daddy govmint to help them out.  They should have double-downed on hard work and attaining skills that are actually valuable, but most took the easy road and assumed the government would offer them more and more (i.e. Bernie, free healthcare, free college, universal income, etc.).  Young people have lost site of how hard their parents had to work to provide them with a positive outcome.  If you want stuff, you gotta produce stuff.  I am a millennial.

Shucks, you caught me.  You're right, I only read Sunday comics.  \n\nI do not even remotely identify with the "alt-right", but are you claiming that anyone that does, could not have possibly read *1984*?  Gee, that just does not make a whole lot of sense, but neither does latching on to MSM propaganda and parroting it as a legit conspiracy in r/conspiracy.  Alas, this is the time we are living in, c'est la vie.
Great point, I just tend to believe one more than the other in terms of doing their due diligence to present information free from bias or incorrect information, but I won't/can't/shouldn't try to force that same trust on you.

Ethyl mercury is a preservative by acting as an antiseptic and anti-fungal agent.  Since 1999 many vaccines no longer use it, due to the same concerns being discussed here.  These results were extrapolated from tests of methylmercury, which appears to be more toxic than ethyl mercury.  Vaccines are important in some cases (think Polio), but mercury is a neurotoxin.  Eliminating ethylmercury as a preservative completely is a good idea in my opinion.

I played hockey with a kid from Sweden.

A teenage Swede was fed up with the mass immigration almost a decade ago.  I can only imagine how he feels now.

Yup I am too.  However I don't want to devalue a college education.  The availability of federal student loans are the reason tuition keeps going up.  If you want stuff you have to produce stuff. I am on track to pay off a massive pile of student debt on time and under budget (interest-wise).  
This comic captures most of the cholos in my high-school (50% hispanic population in my highschool in a prosperous mountain town 10 years ago).  They would wave a giant Mexican flag every pep rally and not participate in *our* national anthem, but sang loudly when we had to listen to theirs.

One is a citizen investigation started on the internet, one is deliberate propaganda from the MSM and other globalist entities.  There are many conspiracies that should/are discussed on r/conspiracy, but "pissgate" is not a conspiracy, and I refuse to let you shitheads conflate the two.  If you have followed conspiracies for a long time, you would see how pizzagate is the culmination of so many of the NWO, globalist conspiracies that eventually get laughed away due to deliberate disinformation campaigns.  If you watched the conspiracy develop real-time, and subsequently saw a concerted effort to quell any progress by virtually all of the MSM, while meanwhile witnessing an anti-establishment candidate being lambasted with a glaringly obvious propaganda campaign, then you too would see what is real and what is not.  Whether it is willful ignorance, or just a severe lack of critical thinking skills, it is not even worth arguing with you because the evidence has been right in front of you for almost six months.  I do not propose that I have some insight to the "grand conspiracy" tying all this shit together, but if you cannot separate the wheat from the chaff, there is no hope for you.  Let's agree to disagree :)

The media/Washington just happened to do everything in its power to stop the guy, but he is a part of the establishment.  This might be hard to believe but having millions, even billions of dollars does not preclude one from caring deeply about the country, or make one complicit with the underlying globalist agenda that has been undermining our interests for the last century (and probably much longer).  I am much more inclined to trust a real estate mogul's son, than someone that made all of their money through a political career that has lasted nearly their entire lifetime.  Are you guys really here defending David Brock, or do you just not like Trump?  I hope it is just the ladder, though for all I know you came from Brock's "war-room" this morning fresh full of easily digestible, yet flawed talking points.  I need to stay off internet forums (I have too many opinions), but I feel like I have a patriotic duty to make your job, just a wee bit harder. 
It was a non political donation duh
I didn't feel good when I typed it because I could give fuck all about fake internet points, but it was worth it because the guy is becoming woke and this perhaps accelerated the process.

Apparently something Sweden related that made it to the front page of r/all.  He contacted me out of the blue because he knows what kinda shit I am in to and wanted me to know he had taken a red-pill with his apple sauce.
Thank you for responding with this... It is a relief.  Yeah he does not have my full trust, but every deliberate MSM propaganda piece that comes out makes me believe him more and more.  I made fun of the guy for most of 2016 (even on election night), but the media red-pilled me on their own.  Obviously we all have our own reality and projecting mine on yours is fighting a losing, useless battle, but I just feel like the last 6 months should have most people on the same page.
Muslims have been immigrating to Sweden in relatively large numbers for more than a decade.  The numbers, and the problems are just becoming large enough for the rest of the world to realize the situation is not sustainable.  Their "social democracy" worked well when there was a high natural resource to population ratio, but breaks down when supporting a massive immigrant population that utilizes the substantial welfare programs available.
He also voted present 130 times.  He was a prop for the shadow government (particularly the Federal Reserve/CIA).
Oh shucks!  Foiled! 
> their economy has skyrocketed in the last decade\n\nBy what metric(s)?  Could it be that until recently the high rate of education, and large natural resource to population ratio has produced a work-force that is productive?  We will have to wait for the full measure of the damage supporting a massive group of unemployed immigrants from a culture unwilling to assimilate is.\n\n> There have been more deadly attacks by Swedish neo nazi groups in the pst five years than there have been of Muslim immigrants.\n\nThis may be true (not sure where this is from either) but no one is going to defend dumb ass neo nazi groups for being hateful, bigoted, shit apples.  That you have to even compare a hate-group, to an immigrant population for the sake of argument is enough to tell me that you are acknowledging that there is a problem trying to take in a massive group of people that believe an ideology that is contradictory to western culture, western democracy, and a functioning economy.

Hey buddy, great straw man, if it only had a brain
###Copypasta from Alt Account\n\nAnecdote about Clooney incoming...\n\nI got to know the actor who witnessed Dominique Dunne's murder at the hands of her boyfriend https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Dunne. He is a great, funny, and genuinely nice guy, and he was just a young kid trying to make it in Hollywood at the time. I am leaving his name out of the story because I know he doesn't like to be associated with the murder.\n\nAfter the murder, Clooney single handedly ruined this guys career (he told my friend he was going to ruin his career) basically blaming my friend publicly and privately for Dunn's murder and calling in favors to blacklist him. He was an innocent bystander there for a script reading. The guy's career was derailed by Clooney just because Clooney decided this guy should be punished for being present (and by present I mean on the property, far removed from where the murder took place in the garden, if memory serves) when the psycho boyfriend decided to take a beautiful young actress' life.\n\nClooney always came off as a smarmy asshole, but hearing this guy recount how Clooney ruined his career after he lost a great friend and cast-mate cemented my feeling that Clooney is a dick.\n
Every time someone misuses a verb (not even sure he explicitly used the word "attended"), let's get upset... You guys are so angry at the only anti-establishment candidate.  If you can't look at the media coverage over the last 6 months and come to that conclusion... well that's what my original post was about.  Keep up the campaign, you are all true patriots.  P.S. I didn't vote for any of these guys, but after seeing the MSM shitting out propaganda everywhere for the last 6 months it is clear who is with and who is against the establishment.  I always make the mistake of assuming there is any hope for paid shills, and indoctrinated pseudo-intellectuals.  Why do I even waste my time here?
If Maury Povich still has a show this bitch should be on it.  Perhaps he would reveal that her great grandfather is actually Chief Stealourmoney, and we'd have to eat crow.

Pizzagate is not, and has never been exclusive to liberals.  In fact, two of the main drivers for people continuing to dig is the Franklin Scandal and Dennis Hastert, which *gasp* don't involve liberals.

The summary says Bernstein exposed hundreds of CIA plant journalists?  \n  \n> Journalists Exposed as Secret CIA Operatives\n  \n> Months after leaving The Washington Post, where he uncovered the Watergate scandal with partner Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein spent six months examining the relationship between the CIA and the media during the Cold War for RS. The groundbreaking piece exposed the fact that more than 400 American journalists,Â­ including reporters for The New York Times, Associated Press and Reuters, doubled as CIA operatives. "Journalists provided a full range of clandestine services — from simple intelligence-gathering to serving as go-betweens with spies in Communist countries," Bernstein wrote.

I pretty much had a pretty blonde handed to me on a silver platter, and instead chose to be quiet.

The real proof that Obama is an alien is the 1961 Hawaiian newspaper that listed his birth. Clearly he went back in time and altered the original birth announcements to add his name.

> Tandy had its own Tandy DOS\n\nYou are probably thinking of much older Tandy 2000:\n\n>  The Tandy 2000 is a personal computer introduced by Radio Shack in September 1983 based on the 8 MHz Intel 80186 microprocessor running MS-DOS.[1] By comparison, the IBM PC XT (introduced in March 1983) used the older 4.77 MHz 8088 processor, and the IBM PC AT (introduced in 1984) would later use the newer 6 MHz Intel 80286. Due to the 16-bit-wide data bus and more efficient instruction decoding of the 80186, the Tandy 2000 ran significantly faster than other PC compatibles, and slightly faster than the PC AT. (Later IBM upgraded the 80286 in new PC AT models to 8 MHz, though with wait states.) The Tandy 2000 was the company's first computer built around an Intel x86 series microprocessor; previous models used the Z80 and 68000 CPUs.\n\nIt was a much better computer than the current IBM PCs. But when you tried to run graphics based MSDOS software  on it the screen would show a double image. Tandy ended up having to put them in Radio Shacks as the original point of sale terminals.

Try going to the state department of labor first. They have a really good reason for them going after the employer. By not paying you, the employer is short changing the state in tax revenues. Smaller amounts mean more to the state than the Feds.\n
Exactly! Since he declared himself  to be a candidate for President, they have tried to paint Donald Trump as an ignorant blowhard who is somehow ill-equipped to become the commander in chief. This in spite of the fact that he has been a successful businessman who has had a hand in  numerous businesses most of which did not have to declare bankruptcy.  Ill equipped to be President? Fair enough. But as to this charge of housing discrimination there is absolutely no proof outside of a few federal civil rights lawsuits for housing discrimination in the 1970s and a settlement agreement. 
You know there is not a little bit of scholarly studies that think otherwise: "Several authors affirmed that wolves are\ncharacterized by a linear dominance hierarchy\n(Fox 1980; Zimen 1982; Savage 1988; McIntyre\n1993). "

Why does everybody seem to ignore the giant elephant  in the GOP room? It is arguable that the only reason Trump was able to squeak out a win was a result of under the radar fake news stories. While you were busy on Reddit they were sharing stories . . .\n\n> The fabricated story posted to a fictional Denver news outlet just before the election “FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE” got more than 500,000 shares on Facebook. “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement” is not remotely true, but one fake-news website reeled in more than 100,000 shares with it. A copycat version of the hoax on Ending the Fed was even more popular, shared more than 900,000 times on Facebook, according to Facebook’s API. [source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/18/this-is-how-the-internets-fake-news-writers-make-money/?utm_term=.f0852ea5e61a)\n\nThe creators of these fake news articles make upwards of $10,000 a month in adsense dollars from Facebook. Don't expect them to stop creating them or Facebook to do anything remotely substantial in blocking them.\n\nThe only solution I can see is to join those right wing mailing lists and when other members say tawdry and loathsome statements  about Democrats you bite your tongue and stay quiet.  But when a story comes up that say claims child abuse and pizza are in this world and not some alternate reality somehow related you have a duty to ridicule the story and the person who forwarded it.

I imagine it was a case of survival of the unfittest. These [ur-dogs](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ur-) were not the so-called alpha wolves of the pack. More likely they were the  omegas who were smaller in size and unable to compete or more likely driven out by the other wolves.  But even though they were rejected by wolves they still had that innate pack mentality. So they went to plan B which was bonding with humans who also showed a pack mentality.  You would expect the humans to just use them as food but enough of them were probably able to show the humans they had skills in finding food that made them more useful to keep alive.  
Howard Zinn's [People's History of the United States](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/zinnapeopleshistory.html)\n\n* “It’s a wonderful, splendid book—a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future.” —Howard Fast, author of Spartacus and The Immigrants\n\n* “[It] should be required reading.” —Eric Foner, New York Times Book Review\n\n* Library Journal calls Howard Zinn’s iconic A People's History of the United States “a brilliant and moving history of the American people from the point of view of those…whose plight has been largely omitted from most histories.” Packed with vivid details and telling quotations, Zinn’s award-winning classic continues to revolutionize the way American history is taught and remembered. Frequent appearances in popular media such as The Sopranos, The Simpsons, Good Will Hunting, and the History Channel documentary The People Speak testify to Zinn’s ability to bridge the generation gap with enduring insights into the birth, development, and destiny of the nation. \n\n
I disagree.  Twenty years ago they would have never considered Bozo for political office.
You can. But you first have to move to either Wyoming or North Dakota.
They also severely overestimate the power of those things too. They were getting distance you might get with a single side band CB radio.  But I just chalked that up to artistic license. 
They actually were the world leader in digital cameras in the 1990s. The Kodak DCS system cameras were far and away better than anything else any other company was producing. But at $10,000 to $40,000 a camera the customer base was severely limited to groups like NASA in the Skylab program. But even with the DCS units Kodak did not use their own cameras and instead retrofitted their image sensing units onto Nikon Professional and semi-Professional SLRs like the F4 and N8008.  Because Kodak cameras, while popular, have almost always been ranged from just adequate to mediocre.  To expect this new camera phone to be anything special is delusional. \n[Kodak DCS 420 Camera: Say Cheese and Forget About Film](https://books.google.com/books?id=PITtFPwTaWwC&pg=PA40&dq=nikon+dcs+420&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCyebO-dXRAhWT2YMKHRCnBMEQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=nikon%20dcs%20420&f=false)\n\nKodak became so big by repeat sales of film. With digital there are of course no repeat sales. The only way they could have made a success of digital would have been through patents. And Kodak did actually take out a patent on digital photography that made them billions. But that patent ran out in 2007. Five years later they went into bankruptcy.
When people refer to the quality of vinyl they are referring to the subjective quality as it sounds to a human ear.  When they speak of the quality of digital they are refering to the sound as it performs when tested by audio engineers using various audio electronic meters and measurements.\n\nClearly the digital version will always be superior. Unless, of course, the listener is hearing a copy of Getz/Gilberto (1963) played on a pretty good Sony turntable through a really, really good McIntosh Amplifier into a decent quality Boston Acoustic speaker in which case you can just leave the oscilloscope in the van Maurice.

Speaking of his own personal sexual history is defending it? The reality being he's on numerous occasion said the same or much worse.

Who cares enough about your weak partisan bullshit to go back through your postings? I'm not defending anyone, just explaining to people like you that milo is the victim of pederasty, not pedophilia.

Homosexuality is part of society now...you are going to have to get used to older men fucking sexually mature children.

I would say it's because the left embraced homosexuality and openness, while the right kept it closeted, historically. Tides are turning and it's amusing seeing the dead media try to fry a gay jew for trying to have an honest dialogue.

He's a victim of pederasty, as he was of a sexually mature age and consented to the sexual encounter with an adult. It's commonplace among the gay community and the experience of nearly every single gay male in the modern world. Embracing homosexuality is embracing pederasty. Like it or not, that's reality.
He's been telling that very same story since day one. Pederasty is commonplace in the homosexual community. How is making the guy more popular considered 'bringing him down?'
Very telling a gay ex-spook democrat hack shit out the "story." That would explain everything.
lol, she lost...let it go.
She lost a long time ago and you are still crying about it? lol, sad.
The gay lifestyle fosters pederasty...*it's an uncomfortable reality.*
He's told that story at least 100 times. Why do people care now? Pederasty is commonplace in the homosexual community. It's sort of humorous that people are bashing a gay guy because he was the victim...*very telling.*
How did they "take out" Milo? Cancellation of a book deal? He doesn't  go to a conservative meeting? lol, all they did is make him more popular. Old media is dead, these little swats from their dying hand makes no difference to anyone.
Pewdiepie added a couple million more subscribers since being "destroyed"...Milo, more popular than ever (He gave a press conference with the entirety of the MSM lapping at his tailcoat,) Inforwars has been a cash cow. Taking away 3 million in ad revenue a year still leaves 7+ million in income(plus the ad void to be filled by hundreds/thousand of competing ad companies)...4Chan, aka reddit's source feed, has been in decline since all the *~~oldfags~~* jumped ship years ago. The dying/drowning MSM are just trying to bring their superior competition down with them...any lifeguard can tell you, the only choice you have is to knock/choke the drowning victim out in order to save them...much ado about nothing...aka, *don't feed Fake News Trolls.*
You'll be okay.
So having a discussion without shitting on someone is defending them? How much more of a partisan hack could you be? The guy is a comic commentator, at best. His whole MO is shock and awe. If you are unfamiliar with the homosexual community, then you might be shocked by pederasty. Hastert fucked little boys as young as 5-8 years old. Hastert is a pedophile.  Nowhere does Milo say he's fucked or plans on fucking children. Wipe that partisan goo from your eyes and try to pretend to be unbiased.
No need to apologize, *even though you are still wrong*. Let me help you out, *hold your hand*...He was past puberty being fucked by an adult male, it's called pederasty. If he had not yet reached puberty it would be called pedophilia. Words have meaning for a reason...mostly to help confused people, not unlike yourself, deal with complicated issues. Now you know...*and that's half the battle.*
Wrong...*and you know it*, which makes it sadder.
Nobody knows or cares about a Richard Spencer prop. There is no white national movement, outside of prison...*where it's mandatory.*

I'm not 'saying' anything, if you are hearing things you might want to consider seeking professional help. Neither did I type anything of the sort. This sub is far from neutral as any opinion differing from that of David Brock's is shit on and dismissed/brigaded.
Bill Cosby drugged and raped multiple women. Milo talked openly about being the victim of a pederast. How he copes with being a victim and his openness about the very active homosexual practice of pederasty doesn't make him a pedophile...no matter how fake news wants to spin it. All publicity is good publicity, *bad publicity is even better.* 
aww, poor little thing you still can't grasp the basics. This is a common spiel of Milo's. I've heard it one thousand times and it's the reality for the mass of the homosexual community. You wanting to hide your head in the sand and make the bad reality go away...is natural, but, little one...it doesn't go away. This is the root of pizzagate. It's what James Alafantis and David Brock have both been accused of, pederasty. Comet pizza is a WELL KNOWN hangout for pederast. The video you presented, almost a whopping 2 minutes long, is about pederasty, not pedophilia. Words have meaning for a reason...mostly to help confused people, not unlike yourself, deal with complicated issues. Don't beat yourself up, it's not your fault you lack education, blame your parents for their failure. 
I highly doubt she's into gay guys...but, maybe she is a pegger?

She admitted to a crime and got away with a crime for lack of evidence. She's still a self professed predatory pedophile.
Nyberg admitted to being a predatory pedophile many times, gave advice on how to turn young girls into lesbians by older women. Just because law enforcement didn't find enough evidence to charge and convict her of her crimes, that doesn't absolve her from her admitted guilt. She is, by her own admission, a pedophile. Milo admitted to being the wanton victim of pederasty. There is a difference. Obviously Nyberg was the victim of sexual abuse, have you seen her? Just because she was the victim of abuse, that doesn't justify her raping children. Milo might jokingly say he was the aggressor and it's okay to fucking young gay boys who are not able to find sexually compatible mates their own age...it doesn't take a trained psychologist to understand he's telling the story jokingly to obfuscate his pain. Remember when Nyberg was all over the news for bragging about raping kids...oh, wait...she's a libtard, they are guilt free when it comes to raping kids...ask [Bryan Singer.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2836062/Bombshell-documentary-Hollywood-pedophile-ring-preying-child-actors-s-linked-X-Men-director-Bryan-Singer-premiers-New-York.html)

Great write-up.

They are illegal aliens and citizens of other countries and one can tell that because they are continually waving the flags of other countries and demanding their rights. For the unschooled, Illegal Aliens have NO Constitutional rights. They have "human rights' which means we can't roll them up in cement and toss them in the ocean, but WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA=citizens. Period. You want open borders? Nice. Please enter into negotiations with both Mexico and Canada on how they need to open their borders.

Once you get caught and deported you cannot come legally :) So best to deport yourself and try legally. That's a better chance than nothing. :D Plus, think of all the family reunions! \n\n

>25 billion supporting illegals \n\nSource?
For non melinated persons you are exactly correct, those are the immigration rules. However those same rules do not apply to persons with brown skin and whose name is Jose or Mohammad...it is what it is. If they applied those rules every person fleeing the US to Canada would have been stopped and taken into custody. Trust me the people fleeing to Canada, are not "our best".\n\nCanada is taking them to make us look bad. Don't care, it's your funeral. We told our government enough and it's over. It's up to Canadians to decide if they want to Sharia or not.
I wish i could kick back, but i worry too much - but I will say, i absolutely do believe that there is a 'Boondock Saints' or 'V for Vendetta' modern-day type organization that does exactly this: realizes there are some people who are too powerful for the courts, so takes matters into their own hands and executes righteous justice upon them.  There HAS to be some good people out there in positions of power/intelligence
corporate tax break are a different arguement  altogether. You can introduce all the it's not fair strawman arguements you'd like, it doesn't change the facts. illegal immigration is illegal , we need to know and regulate who's coming into our country, and we need Voter ID. Like he said , open borders is not reality, the traffic only goes one way.
Thats a good point
I love the truth. It comes from having swallowed too many lies in this life, given too much of my hope away to ideologies that are fantasy.

It's not broken. He's just lazy af.
Did you notice they factored in the 3.7 billion paid in taxes? I didn't find the site to be biased. In fact that number has been spoken of almost everywhere when referring to California's welfare expenditures for illegals.  Are you asking ME to provide YOU with a source that feeds you numbers you can be comfortable with? Perhaps CNN has different numbers.
Was reading the insider on 4chan and he said something akin to people being "removed" in multiple ways. If they release the names looking for links to CF et al would probably help. Not sure because one gets the feeling that there's a LOT of people not even on the radar but who are "part of the problem."\n\nCould be a hit on the good guys or a hit on the bad guys. At this point I'm just kicking back and watching the fight.
You didn't say anything of any note. I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings but "dwarfed by corporate tax breaks" still doesn't decrease the crowded classrooms, clean up crime ridden neighborhoods or perhaps it was the "probably because I've seen reports" LOL. I bet you Nancy Grace. She's always "seen reports Larry". \n\nIf your befuddled, confused and disjointed comment was something I was intended to address, I completely missed your point. Likely because it was lazily communicated or, maybe, I've heard all that tired old crap before and its irrelevant.

Oh lord, you've glossed over pretty much every counterpoint I brought up. I'll bet you really think Trump is your savior, which is outright laughable. Enjoy your con-artist president.
obviously FBI will catch anyone's eye, but Americans flying on a private plane in Australia are likely going to be wealthy types like CEO's or lawyers, not middle class workers 
What people are missing about pedogate and all this stuff is that the real power players wont be caught. Instead, all the links to them will. Thus providing them with immunity from public condemnation. There is a reason the floating eye over the pyramid is their symbol. The are knocking out the bottom pegs so they can float freely above the public.
Sign me up for that job! They always say find something you love to do
You should work on that. Worrying is a useless emotion. It's all so much to think about, worrying about it only makes it worse. 
Do you have a less biased source and does this factor in the taxes that they pay into it? Or the fact that they get less in tax benefits than citizens do?

Greg Reynolds De Haven is the name of the former FBI Agent who died in the crash.\n\nI haven't been able to find any references to him that are not about the crash. I'd say there is a high probability that he was considered a high value target, possibly as a witness. It would be worthwhile to see if anyone can track down any information that would connect him to past FBI trafficking cases.
I don't even. I don't understand how AMERICAN women can cheer Linda Sansour who is an unabashed Sharia law advocate and a BFF to Hamas, and ALLAH AKBAR at the tops of their lungs (then bitch b/c Melania read the Lord's Prayer) and have that monster Donna Hilton, who murdered a man by shoving a metal pipe up his ass and claiming it was justified because he wiggled when it went it therefore he must be gay. And marching about wearing vaginas? WTAF? Oh hey gramma can you tell me about the time you wore a vagina and marched against human and women's rights and cheered a murderer?\n\n\nResonant disconnect...and if you bring it up, they only retort is OMG ur so raciss, bigoted, xenophobic Hilter. \n\nLook, the media surely did whip things up, but I'm sorry, I've never in my life let the media dictate what I do. People are responsible for their own behavior. There's way too little of that. \n\nWhy are you afraid? BECAUSE TRUMP....because what? I wouldn't have voted for him if he were antigay, but I'm damn pleased he's set the bathroom issue straight. Mentally ill persons do not have the right to drive policy. They need help, not encouragement. And no one should ever bully or harm someone who is mentally ill. We've got an entire generation of kids raised in day care by harried workers whose only interest was in creating calm cooperative collective behavior. \n\nI have had enough of the racist shit. 2% of white Americans owned slaves, but 17% of blacks who could, owned slaves. Africans sold their captives into slavery. I'm sick of idiot academics who haven't left their office in 20 years dreaming up asshattery like "it's racist to read to your kids", http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/new-family-values/6437058\n\n it's racist to use good grammar...\n\nhttp://heatst.com/culture-wars/university-of-washington-writing-guru-declares-american-grammar-racist-and-unjust/\n\nStop making excuses for people who fail their kids and who are not intelligent enough or don't care to learn to speak, read and write proper English and know how/when to use it. If it puts them at a disadvantage so be it. \n\nWe pander to stupid trying to make everyone feel good and sideline intelligent people...and we've landed ourselves smack dab in the middle of an Idiocracy. (Watch it if you haven't, it's prophetic.)\n\n\n\n
People die everyday
All of this ^ ! \nI have tried and tried to get people I know IRL to explain why they are afraid. Why they are outraged. I get nothing but the excuse "if you don't get it you are part of the problem". I can't fathom what happened from Nov. 7th to Nov 8th that turned me from a close friend/good neighbor/co-worker to mortal enemy #1 overnight. \n\n\n
they shouldn't get ANY tax benefits, at all , they're not citizens 
Probably because I've seen other reports with much different numbers? \n\nThis doesn't even begin to factor in how this is dwarfed by corporate tax breaks, giveaways, etc. \n\nNah, let's focus on the most disenfranchised group in the country and blame them.
If you worry, you suffer twice.

I just picked a .270 as well and put this $169.00 [vortex](http://www.basspro.com/Vortex-Crossfire-II-Rifle-Scope/product/12050409013629/) scope on it. The other scope I was considering was this $199.00 [leupold](http://www.basspro.com/Leupold-VX1-Rifle-Scope/product/591888257/) scope.\n\nEDIT: Both come with lifetime warranty so that is always a plus. 
Apparently they only price match for TVs now. I tried this yesterday to no avail.
I wish they would bring it to the campus area.  I've got the best internet ATT provides and it isn't really enough. 
Sometimes shit is just beyond hope.  FF at 20.
Better than our attempt to score.

Did you put a brace in the middle also or was that enough to hold them up with water running through?
How did you brace the channels to the windowsill on the right?
The biggest concern here is an accident in construction or a leak that could taint the aquifer.  This pipeline had quite a bit of opposition in certain areas of Arkansas.  There is definitely nothing wrong with being passionate about about your local water source and thinking about the generations to come.   It doesn't help that there were multiple spills in the news recently.  I just don't see how their hearts and brains aren't in the right place.  They peacefully let their voice be heard about an issue they had.  
I definitely thought it was a coffee grinder and 4 piles of ground nugs. 
This [list](http://ilovememphisblog.com/2014/04/the-no-frills-guide-to-brunch-in-midtown-memphis/) is two years old but still relevant. Slider Inn is normally my go to followed by Bayou.

I don't think they can outbid FedEx for them. 
Fear mongering spread by the labor union.
They're great for attracting butterflies and for trellising a patio! 
It has been awesome! This is my first year growing them and I have had Gulf Fritillaries (plural spelling?) everywhere on my front porch.  
Unless bands are playing at bars such as Young Avenue Deli or Lafayette's there won't be a cover.  The only place I ever get cover charged in midtown when there is no show is Celtic. Since you guys enjoy brewery hopping y'all should check out Wiseacre, Memphis Made, & High Cotton. I think Ghost River just opened their taphouse too but I am not for sure on that. 
It isn't just Lux. It seems from Gold down none of these AP "supports" or even actual supports know wtf a sightstone or support item is.  Mostly just the sightstone.  I can't count how many games I have to listen to the little bitches cry at bot lane for me to come gank because they are getting crushed yet their shit support still has no sightstone.
My family has been growing figs my whole life and we have only ever eaten them 3 ways: fresh, dried, or made into fig bread. You could use them in brewing a Belgian Dubbel or added into salads as well. 
Wiseacre is celebrating their 3rd birthday this weekend with a bunch of infused beers and music Thursday-Saturday!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/239459963117068/
Our Sheriff Office Chief Inspector is one ignorant sad sack. He loves spreading misinformation and has no clue what is talking about.
Not sure what vibe or type of place you want but the New Daisy, Hi-tone, Lafayette's, Newby's, Young Avenue Deli, and Minglewood are probably good places to start your search.  These locations range from our Midtown to Downtown areas.
It is just so hard to climb the ladder as a lowly support. Yay bot lane is crushing, but top and mid are feeding. Then the adc can't position when the time comes for the fedness to shine.
Deebs901
If I head up the river to ward blue and you get wrecked for being too far in lane as the jungler comes from the tower, then I don't see how this is my problem.  You were already out of position in a 2v1 scenario. 
I think I paid about $1500 max per tooth and I had both the two top front ones done. That is with insurance though.  
Only if people look at the minimap
I haven't gone the past couple years.  I'm definitely more inclined to go this year than some of the previous ones.
There is probably more than two sides feeding us bull shit.  We already are divided.  Rich/poor, D/R, black/white, etc. The goal is to keep us divided.  Keep pushing news real or fake that makes both sides pissed off at each other instead of all of us coming together and condemning the whole lot of them. 
Meanwhile I check my minimap, since ADC hasn't, and see 2 wards and a pink around dragon, blue, and tribush.... Playing solo as support is so tilting.
This is pretty accurate.  From Memphis Campus to Midtown rent is around $700-$900 for 2 bedrooms and somewhere between $1200-$1300 for 3. 
Sweet! I was looking for this the other day and couldn't find any audio.
They're bright.  You could wrap the light with dark cloth and have it hang down around the Aerogarden or use something reflective to help light hit other areas of your plants and block out light from entering the room.
yes.\n
I am so ready to bbq these champions with a solar flare. Can you say extra crispy!
I know what you are saying. It is still absolutely disgusting that a person is his position willfully and purposely lies to a council that is meant to make decision on a subject that they clearly don't understand either.  This man prices a half ounce at $3000 grand essentially and of course refuses to say how Colorado has had a + 2.4billion dollar economic impact and created 18000 jobs... 
Right? It is like we have an infinite amount in our SS or will always have one before a SS is purchased.
The answer to your first question could be little to none or a lot.  If they are using padded or flat jaw that doesn't have spikes and is the appropriate size then they are probably fine, I'm going to assume this is the case.  The animal has probably been there for less than 24 hours as it is a law to check traps daily.  You'd always prefer a quick kill but not all are.

I bought Passion plants last year to do this with Gulf Fritillaries.  I had soo many of them chrysalizing on my front porch and hatching. it was pretty awesome walking up to my front door and stirring all the butterflies up.  I bought milkweed seeds to start this over the next spring to get Monarchs too.  
Of course. That is the best thing that all of us citizens/plebians can do. 
A buddy and I went out Saturday afternoon around 2 pm and caught about 10 large mouths out of my pond but only 7 were keepable.  We started with some scum frogs but didn't get a lot of action so we switched to some weedless lizards and tore up the banks around the pond.  We pulled out of the pond around sundown and barely made our way back to the barn thru all the mud where we filleted them and fried them up.
I am. Actually getting ready to leave here in the next hour.  I just don't know if I am going straight to Alpharetta Thursday or coming back to Memphis first.  
I thought I heard an Asian Bistro was taking its place. 
The after care is rough.  I had to have one redone and the dental dude said that one of my two are about as long as a golf tee.
Cycling, kayaking, fishing, gardening, gaming, and catching as many Memphis Tigers or Grizzlies games as I can. Local shows are nice too.
I picked up some in Nashville this past weekend so I doubt Memphis is far behind.  
This week has been phenomenal! Barely made it to both shows on time but well worth it. Nashville was super hot and second set last night was FIRE. I was worried in that first set that I might fall asleep and freeze to death. 
I haven't lost a game with Sejuani since this mastery came out. 
He was an officer for only 7 years somewhere in between the 70s and 80s.  After that he worked for Goldman Sachs, dabbled in Hollywood, then became a founder and was chair of Breitbart.  You don't see the issue here? I'm not saying Obama's picks were right either but this is ridiculous.  The man has little experience and has no problem pushing a "misogynist, xenophobic, and racist" narrative.
If that is the case then it is likely a good deal.  I'd still want the serial number to call the shop he got it from and confirm it isn't stolen. Nothing against OP.  
Helmets are ugly though. Pure white would look better
I firmly disagree.  I went to private schools my whole life and there were definitely people who were just as smart if not smarter at some public schools in my area. Some public schools even have optional programs and those students would easily excel a good portion of private school children.  It really comes down to cost and it is often more expensive than public colleges.  Private schools allow for you to essentially pay for your child's grade in some instances because that is the product that is being sold.
Isn't Dyncorp also part of the organ harvesting and pizzagate stuff? If this is the case how does this fit the whole Trump and his team going after pedos/organ harvesters? Genuine questions. No snark.
Hot peanut oil and corn meal and eggs for the batter.  Add hot sauce as needed. Didn't really check the temp or time.
I went 9-1 and won my next game after placements and got Bronze II so don't feel bad.
Can we not lose to Navy this year? Maybe stop the option and get some first downs instead of shitting on the opportunities given. 
If you are going to eat after working out but have fasted prior to the workout is it still worth taking them?
Do you still have the Herbalizer?\n
I'M SCARED TO FINISH MY PLACEMENTS CURRENTLY SITTING AT 8-0 ON THEM. WHAT DO I DO?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
How many were playing Runescape?
As a security consultant who designs then inspects IDF/MDF/Security equipment rooms you make me really happy.  I hate going in atrocious looking rooms.
Heavy investigation from the picture there... The real question is which Quick model is it?  This does two things: gives us a better idea this is indeed not stolen, and let's us know what the price range should be. If this is anything better than a Quick 8 it is a great deal. 
I hope so too. It won't be near as crowded as it was in Chicago.  I remember trying to bar hop after the Phish show this year at Wrigley and that was impossible with the lines to get in the door.
Agreed, many of these already appeared to be in the works for a while.  A lot of them aren't even "Pedo" stings as some are ADULT hookers, johns, and prostitutes.  I'm all down for arresting Pedos, but this seems more like a dog and pony show to provide police more oversight to do what they please.  I think Trump's recent comments about civil asset forfeiture also lead to this conclusion. 
Not saying it is smart but this is for the GoPro of the World contest.
Patton Computers in Collierville is the only thing that comes to mind.  Most people I know just buy their computer parts online or use a Microcenter proxy through Reddit. \n\nEdit: I would also check /r/buildapcsales and pcpartpicker and watch for rebates. 
I never said there wasn't. I just think that is one of the possible negatives.  I do applaud you though in helping your son be socially active during homeschooling as parents are a lot of this process and that is also something that is **seriously lacking** in today's education system.

I'm sure it would taste like gamey dog.

As a Tennessean how is something like [this](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/18/state-lawmaker-threatens-funding-nashville-memphis-over-pot-bills/90522754/) going to play out for us?\n
Should probably add to /r/memphis too\n
I second Fayette County.  It has grown quite a bit since my parents did the same in '94.  Plenty of recently built homes on small-large lots.  All you have is a Kroger and Walmart but it only takes 30-45 minutes to get to downtown or the airport(no traffic).  The only problem I see is schools. Fayette Academy is alright otherwise you pretty much have to go private.
This [site](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid-scholarships/1505285-automatic-out-of-state-tuition-waivers.html) has some schools listed based on GPA/ACT. 
Ya our pond is kind of overrun with bass so I've been trying to get some of them out before they anymore spawn.  
You are right, they aren't the same and it definitely is harder these days as wages seem to have stagnated while the cost of living rises.  Side note, encourage trying to stick to Scouts through Eagle.  It can help with future jobs and college admission plus he might as well enjoy as much of the outdoors as he can(while it lasts).  
When I started my service this was the experience I had and that was definitely less than two years ago.
I take it using a pull up assist machine works similarly to negatives? Getting out of shape is no fun. 
[Does he?](http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/sen-corker-backs-betsy-devos-education-secretary/97405118/) It doesn't seem so but I could be wrong.  
It is funny Janis Fullilove doesn't support this or having it in your car even though she has 2 DUI's and multiple driving on a suspended license charges.  
Deebs901:356:hunter
Interesting.  These fritillaries would just eat their heart out then climb all over everything to chrysalize. They were on my mailbox, door, porch ceiling, and metalwork. My passion plants have been left quite bear.  I'm hoping they make it back over the winter.
My little brother had his out of state waived to go to Miss State. I think it is based on ACT and GPA.  
It's unfortunate that, like a car, you lose such a high percentage of the value out of the store seeing as how that is a $650 bike from their site.
Superlo, Cashsaver, & The Beer Garden all have pretty good beer selections.

I would say all of those work pretty well then except maybe Lafayettes. I don't know anything about trying to book a band at these places though.  
Obviously should say 3 grand or 3000. You get the idea. Obviously he wouldn't because he doesn't want it to be decriminalized. He should say it because it is the truth instead of his pandering nonsense.
I think you meant to say Wiseacre. \n\nedit: what a B-E-A-utiful edit!
So rows and lat pulldowns until you can do pull ups?\n
Isn't all this push back from the labor union. I thought that was the name I saw on the funding for all the fliers that just added to the trash that floats around the city.  
I have had good experiences with [Ubiquiti](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=UBIQUITI+CAMERAS) cameras.  They're interface isn't that difficult either.  We have set them up in our office, my boss's apartment, and my buddy's house and have had zero issues.  
We aren't supposed to. I would just not like to lose again this year. I feel like we shit the bed after haha. 
Driving from Memphis tomorrow after work.  Going to be cutting close but I am stoked to catch Nashville and Alpharetta!
Leonard's lunch buffet has got to be the best deal.  Central ribs are still far better than Corky's.  The only thing Corky's has going for it is a drive-thru window. 
Thats cuz the general public is soft and lives in a dream world
This^
Sure i can agree with the double standard
I really don't care about the privacy of rich powerful people - they buy and sell our private information - they tap our phones and computers - i think its a nice compromise that if they decide to fuck the public through legislation or through scandal, it is fitting that we have their home address and phone #s - seems fair to me
The ambassador dying
I was wondering this myself - look up r/fbi2 ; I think there has legitimately been an influx of justice being served -ninjakick666 archives all of the happenings
Illegal - but a bad ass mother fucker
Did anybody else notice that AJ kept saying to Rogan throughout their conversation stuff like "you already know all of this" with a shit eating grin on his face.\n\nI kind of shrugged it off the first time because i figured AJ was just high and drunk - but i was thinking about it and I almost wonder if he was legitimately insinuating some shit like JR knows way more than he is letting on
I think the press knows what they are allowed to 'go after', regardless of whose cabinet it is; whether it is trump himself or his staff, press would be stopped because its such a can of worms
Cant say i agree - this line of thinking that an 'older man can guide a young teenage boy who "gives consent"' is toxic - truth is in the eye of the beholder, and there are loads of sick fuck pedos who justify their actions by thinking they are helping a confused underage kid.\n\nFuck that man, thats pizzagate right there - i dont care if the age on consent is variable ; if it was my 13 year old being hunted by a 40 year old, i would fucking kill the older man
Lol it sounds fake as shit
The law should be looked at like a fail safe measure - ideally, you are correct.  But in the real world, not all parents are created equal.  Some kids have only one parent that works 2 jobs.  Some kids have no parents.\n\nIts not as simple as 'raise them better' - you need a law that says "leave these kids the fuck alone until they have at least had a fighting chance to mature and develop a reasonable sense of consequence."\n\nMost 16 year olds understand what sex is and how sex works - but what they dont understand are the psychological ramifications of having sex with a predatory partner, or even the physical ramifications like impregnation or disease.  This is a very complicated topic, and a "hands off until they are 18" is just the safest/best way to deal with the matter
Centuries - since the dawn of man, i reckon.   I think life is cyclical - these bad people infiltrate everything overtime, and it eventually brings the whole system crashing down - then a resistance of good people rise up, kill most of the bad people, and rebuild a new kingdom; and then once again, bad people slowly infiltrate over a long time period and it comes crashing down again - this is the story of the Bible, in my opinion; it has nothing to do with Creation, in the sense that we think or imagine it
"He was askin' for ittttt"
I agree with this - point out the double standard, but dont try to get maher fired over it
Lol based on what?  Where is this survey?  I love America, but i dont blindly trust memes without sourcing
Man- people have busy crazy lives, and some people have never stopped to really think deeply about life from a totally different perspective.  I can totally see how this podcast could change some peoples' lives.  Joe Rogan is a very relatable guy, and its easier to allow yourself to have your imagination taken for a ride by somebody like joe, whereas somebody like david icke is just too much for most people
Oh lordy - i didnt see this one.  I saw the joe rogan one.  I can sort of defend the joe rogan clip - but i uh, i cant defend this one.  This is a big problem
Sorry, I didn't see the correct video - I just watched it and shared it here.  I don't know why its not on HOT right now - shits ridic
Good point!  Now its antifa vs us.  But hey, hopefully things are safer for our boys in blue - we're gonna be needing them soon
The point here isnt Milo - its BILL.  STAY FOCUSED
The point is Bill here - not Milo
Trump gets dismissed way too often as being an idiot or 'insane' - if you buy that angle, you literally fell into net #1 that was set out for you by MSM and alt media - love him or hate him, he is far from being stupid - he is literally several steps ahead whether you like it or not
This is a conspiracy sub - why has nobody said that a psych eval doesn't even matter?  If the regime wants him, they will keep him; if they don't, they will get rid of him - stop trying to fool yourself into thinking that a psych eval is the way to get him out of office to please yourself because you personally don't like him - its meaningless to the people running the show
I just read it - its a good post.  But the issue with his video clips is that they basically embolden the swaths of actual pedophiles who believe in their heads that they are 'guiding' young gay boys and helping them - its a diseased mind set, and it absolutely exists in droves, not just for older men chasing boys, but also older men chasing illegal teen girls
Definitely - but fuck it, who cares.  So tired of this degeneration of society
That poor fucking guy - i was just scrolling through his twitter
Being downvoted af - here comes crises control
I agree with this sentiment- but if u watch the video, he wasnt making a joke.  He literally believes an older woman should be able to rape a young teen boy
If its used on the correct guilty people, sure, that would be great
I personally think Milo is a product of the CIA lol (in a good way) - he sort of closes the gap between being gay/trans whatever and having conservative values - his message is pretty brilliant and simple: you can be 'different' and still support and benefit from the values of the American foundation that made us so great to begin with
That was my initial impression; but when i watched again, it seemed a little peculiar when and how AJ would say it with this big smirk on his face, saying joe knows more than he does and shit - i think there was more to it than that literal impression
Is this the Joe Rogan clip?  He straight up said that hollywood elite were fucking around with extremely young boys / twinks - how fucked up is that
I think i underatood what Milo was saying in that clip; it was sort of the gay-man version of how I felt when I was 14 and i was checking out female teachers double my age who i wanted to bone.\n\nIrregardless, under no circumstance is it acceptable for the adult to act on that, regardless of if the youth thinks they want it or not - hopefully joe rogan defends milo on this one ; seems to me that his words were being twisted, but idk
Trump declined Feinberg publically in his conference last week - the media reported it like it was happening
In my opinion, if people stopped battling Trump over stupid shit that either doesn't matter or isn't there, and everybody just focused on making sure he does what he said he would do (which is essentially a blueprint for an America that was intended and a strengthening of the middle class); then everything would be just fine.  I don't mean to sound like a Trump whore, but the core of his message is pro-America and anti-globalism ; why bother trying to reverse engineer and backtrack all of the time?  We should just be applying pressure to ensure he sticks to his platform
When he was a young teenage boy he had sex with a priest that was like twice his age - according to Milo, it wasn't rape because Milo pursued it / instigated it, and he said that it was helpful to him as developing as a homosexual - its ambiguous if he really means/thinks that, or if it is just a coping mechanism.\n\nThis is a complicated situation- he was irrefutably raped (by law).  Him 'justifying it' may just be a coping mechanism, but its dangerous rhetoric, because that is the justification that actual child molesters/rapists use to defend themselves when they do this shit.\n\nPersonally, I don't know what the solution here is - I don't like the fact that he was sort of encouraging young teen gay boys to have sex with older men, because it was 'helpful to him when he was a teen'.  But that doesn't necessarily make Milo a pedophile - this is very complicated and i dont think people who are so sure about one side or another are really thinking it through thoroughly and just acting emotionally, in his defense or against him
I can defend his joe rogan clip; but i just saw this one, and i cant defend this shiat\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/833405993006616576/video/1\n\nThis is part of the problem
Take a sample and send it to a lab if you think its chemtrails
Gaddamnit, it never ends, does it
On one hand - I kind of understood what he was saying ; like, when I was 14 or 15, i was definitely eyeing female teachers of mine that I would totally bone that were double my age.  So, I think thats basically the mindset that Milo had when he was a teen towards older men.\n\nThat being said - its still fucking illegal as shit and it should be enforced, whether the teen 'gives consent' or not.  Its up to the adult to recognize that it is their responsibility to preserve the innocence of youths until they are fully developed legal adults - your mindset changes dramatically through your teens and 20s; you could think you want something and not realize what youre getting into.\n\nI wish Milo would call these people out by name
Go watch George Webbs series - he explains how the blackmail Brownstone operations work.\n\nAlso, it only takes one pedophile to infiltrate the gov and get to a position of power - when they happens, they can insert other people that they know are pedophiles into lower seats of power because they can be easily controlled thru blackmail - they may be incompetent, be they will do whatever you tell them to do or else they get thrown under the bus
Thank you for your service
Dis shits being downvoted - Milo has some important answers / information for us
Sure, but its suspicious as fuck based on whats going on.  Did u forget that youre in a conspiracy forum or something?
How does the public ensure that something is actually done about all this stuff - the articles are great awareness; but how do you verify that something is actually done about it?
Haha thats hilarious
Nice brand new account you got there, chum
If it is, its not working too well - people are chomping at the bit just to find one piece of smoking gun evidence so they can hit the streets and start cracking skulls
I have to agree - i only saw the joe rogan one at first, and i thought it was defensible.  This shit isnt defensible though.  This mindset that older gay men may have that they can 'guide' young gay boys is delusional predatory thinking, and its a fucking problem.\n\nHopefully milo will spill the beans on the other freaks in hollywood who think this shit is okay ; aside from that though, this isnt really redeemable.\n\nAnd i was a full on Milo supporter too, which sucks.  But this is disgraceful thinking.  Welcome to pizzagate folks
Yea, that would be nice
Fuck man
Thats not true at all - he has intelligence backing him, and so far it has been extremely methodical - the blowback from the media and liberal politicians is literally resistance from their exposure as frauds
Hopefully somebody saved this
Anybody who receives this much hate and controversy must be good - I bet when Jesus Christ was walking around waking people up, there were shills hanging around going "THIS MOTHERFUCKER KNOWS HOW TO MAKE 4-TIER SHELVING - IF THATS NOT ESTABLISHMENT THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS"
Ugh the SJWs will love this guy - if he became president, US would truly be fucked
Dude, don't defend this shit.  This is part of the problem - this mindset that adult men are guiding young teenage boys is sick.  Look at this shit: https://mobile.twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/833405993006616576/video/1\n\nThe only hope for Milo is that he sells out some of the freaks engaging in this shit
Lol i think thats a rally for moar Trump doom porn
Thanks!  I didnt see that!
This - in fact, i think down to the core, both the left and right agree 100% with what you said - but everybody is being polarized by a completely irresponsible media and criminal politicians - we are all way more similar as human beings than what we are given credit for.  We generally all enjoy peace, prosperity and happiness; period
What were the scores before?  Because trump is losing in that screenshot
You missed the point - Milo was basically hinting at what we regard as 'Pizzagate' to be a real thing going on
Lol, well not everybody realizes that, and if they did, it would be a major problem for the ring.  Thats why pizzagate exists
Mother fucker man - this is clearly coordinated
Tf are u talking about?  I want to see him get his due for making ridiculous comments just like anybody else does.  Maybe i always see his stuff getting advertised because i live in a blue state
What evidence do you think he has besides his word?  I think they would have been suspicious if he was walking around recording a hollywood sex party with his iphone - i'm not trying to defend milo, at least be a little realistic and logical in regards to that kind of a statement - honestly, even if he did have evidence, he would probably just be murdered
Well, he is a dangerous faggot, so maybe he has some tricks up his sleeve
Hopefully milo will at least expose a few of the freaks who he knows have been engaging in this shit
I don't think just dropping names would work in his favor - he would need actual evidence to support that, or else it would just blow up in his face
No - its people defending their right to have news accurately conveyed to them.  The article is misleading.  Whether you like trump or not, this type of shit is a major issue
This deserves a sticky - this is absolutely ridiculous.  The jacked tatted guy wants to fucking knock him out, too lol
I think you highly overestimate the amount of casual gymrats who use gear. \n\nMost people here aren't competitors and most people here are natty. 
This warg is a symbol of pure hatred.
Interesting theory - Milo was a 'finder' - not bad; makes sense on some level.  He is basically a walking billboard for his own sexuality - i'm not homosexual, but im not afraid to admit that Milo is a very good looking gentleman ; he would be perfect at finding young gay people to come join his brigade, whilst doing his tours at colleges/universities (although, these would be legal age gay pupils at universities; they wouldn't be illegal).  It would be exploitative in a way (not illegal), but no more so than a musician sleeping with fans.\n\nI don't mind your theory; definitely an interesting one.   There isn't any real hard evidence; and you have to remember that Milo WAS raped as a teenager.  Everybody is killing him over things that he SAID, but totally glossing over the fact that he was raped lol.  I don't agree with what his perspective was, but i understand his perceptions on what happened to him are going to be warped as such
And the reality is, the public will probably suffer more than anybody if there is a retaliation
Thats the key - the fact that nobody knows what he is planning on doing is his greatest asset - the fact that shills come online and try to make assumptions like "they are friends, he wont prosecute, blah blah blah" only really increases the smokescreen.\n\nI'm not claiming to know what his intent is - but he has the ability to do serious damage if he wants because the entire country is disoriented.  But I will say this - I believe that they were all 'chummy' with one another; but I strongly believe that this presidency is a classic case of 'business, not personal', and hard-hitting high level establishment people are going to get fucked by this administration (which is good for the public)
Ugh - it makes for a great story, but there is absolutely zero evidence
The problem isn't that the 'right' is just blindly blaming or hating immigrants for everything.  The problem is that they are being portrayed that way - if you actually talk to these people in person, all that they want is reassurance that immigrants aren't pouring in enmasse, un-vetted, and then not assimilating and not being promptly situated as part of the work force - it is all too common that people are just being brought in, and then are living on government assistance, and then voting blue because they don't realize the spiral of dependency that they are trapped in because of a dysfunctional misappropriated system - the right understands immigrants aren't inherently bad; they just want the process done correctly
Personally, I don't think its reasonable to arbitrarily just automatically assume that he is a puppet of the system.  Most of the people I see making that assertion only back it up by saying 'well, he's friends with the Clintons; or he made a statement about Jeff Epstein; or Mercer (or whatever the fuck his name is), or some of his cabinet members are questionable, ect.  There hasn't really been a concrete or conclusive argument or pattern.\n\nIf you are going to say that he is just a puppet, then that implies that the whole media / political and celebrity war against the Trump administration is essentially a big play/make pretend.  I know there are a lot of people here who believe that, and I think you give the 'system' way too much credit.  These people, regardless of much money they have, are still a bunch of incompetent idiots at times who make mistakes like any other human-being - they aren't gods (like they want you to think they are).  It takes years of effort and huge amounts of money, and major risk just to compromise all these people in the first place; let alone have it all just be make pretend.\n\nI don't doubt that a bi-product that they enjoy for all the collusion and warring is the public turning on each other and keeping themselves busy fighting - but it seems pretty obvious to me that that is only a side effect, and the real big picture is that there is a new big guy on the block, and whatever webs they spun is in danger.\n\nThe friendships and alliances that may have existed with trump in the past don't really matter - trump's admin seems to have their own new agenda compared to the globalist one that we are used to; and this presidency is business, not personal; so people will undoubtably be betrayed.\n\nAll of that being said, I will offer some things I wish Trump would do better - I wish he would do a better job uniting the 'left' and 'right' public - some people will always refuse to like him, and thats fine - but I wish he would change some of his rhetoric, and maybe be more vocal and receptive to some of the environmental concerns many people are having with him.  I think he has already made it clear that he isn't anti-lgbt and he isn't anti-muslim, even though people refuse to let it go.  So, idk
You clearly didn't read what I wrote
Petraus has a shady af background.  Go watch George Webbs series on youtube
Is this gonna go anywhere? Some pretty disgusting statements on Bill's part; but i doubt this will have the legs that the Milo tape did - all of social media and msm push / plug Bill hardcore all the time ; theres no way they will let this go viral
You don't need to know who the shadow government is to realize that there is something very wrong with the way things are right now - sometimes, some standard respect / humility and common sense can go a long way
This guy is a covert villain, i guarantee it.  In fact, Steve Pieczenik denounced him in a video on youtube years ago - should have listened to Steve then
Prosecute the MOLE!
Isnt a swastika supposed to be angled 45 degrees anyways - doesnt it mean something different if it is orthogonal like that? Or am i just retarded
He didnt go around telling people to shut up and deal with it ; thats a big misconception that so many people are having.  The reality is, he was raped - yet, in his twisted mind, he claims that it wasn't rape and that he pursued it.  Hard to know how he really truly feels about it.  But i think its dangerous to throw out the idea that young boys can count on older men to help guide them - thats the sort of shit logic that older predators want to use to justify themselves
I'm always happy to see happy relationships and people staying together. I'm just cynical about the government institution of marriage and the state of modern social/gender dynamics. \n\nMy logical mind tells me that getting married is fucking stupid. \n\nNot to mention I'm 26 and never been in a real relationship despite sleeping with 30+ women.  
I mean, thats fair - but i still watched the clips and thought some of what he said was a bit fucked up.  Like, i understand the bit about being a teenager and wanting to bang an older person - i had female teachers i wanted to bang.  But to phrase it like its something special and magical for an older person to guide a young teenage gay person is really just the type of justification that these freaks want to hear so they can continue to pursue young teens in a predatory way - no sir ; that ain't kosher.  Honestly, im a tolerant person, but homosexuality is still something i dont like to see displayed in public or something i want to think about - but you throw a teen boy in there, and im about ready to grab a torch and pitch fork
Agree w styx - can't talk positively and promote in good conscience about an adult man having sex with young teenage boys - when in doubt about how you should feel, just imagine it is your 14 yo kid who gets preyed on by a 40 yo - that pretty much without question clears it up for me
Eh thats literally just a joke though - i grew up listening to opie and anthony, and that is honestly nothing.  Havent you heard 'Uncle Paul' speak on the radio.  Good heavens\n\nEdit: i changed my mind - i missed the part about bill saying 'how can a woman rape a kid'. He's a fucking idiot
Ugh i just saw this one.  I didnt know this one existed too.  I cant defend this shit:\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/833405993006616576/video/1\n\nMilo is disgraced now, which is unfortunate because i was just starting to like him a lot
I agree now - i didnt watch the right video initially.  His statement was straight up encouraging teen rape if its a woman
Sweet jesus thats a loaded title there - idk if i can dig into that article
Cia heart attack gun- google it
Holy shit i didnt notice that - he wants to punch his throat
Theyre the same damn thing
So, i guess this means that when Milo was going to do his live exposé on Pizzagate, he wasn't bullshitting - he was really gonna spill some shit, or at least address the situation
Well, that basically confirms pizzagate lol
Lol ugh its gonna be underwhelming, i already know - the real world isnt as sexy and exciting as my imagination
> The sooner you escalate, the sooner you know if she's actually attracted to you.\n\nGoodlookingloser taught me that. \n\nDuring nightgame it's best to escalate hard and fast to force the woman's hand. If she's good, continue to escalate. If she isn't interested, find a girl who is.\n
Fucking nailed it.\n\nPatrice O'Neal predicted this over a decade ago.\n\n"Here's what society is doing. They're making it wrong to be a man. They're taking everything about being a man and making it a bad thing"
Lol military drug tests don't test for gear bro. There's current IFBB pros in the services right now. I know one of the main guys for classic physique is in the Air Force.\n\nA piss test cannot detect steroid use.\n\nA commander would have to specially order a testosterone test for a specific soldier he suspected and most won't even if they know because they like the publicity and image of having jacked muscular soldiers.

> he wanted a true blue pill Disney type love but got a good case of AWALT.\n\nHence why the redpill exists.\n\nWomen themselves create 1000x more redpillers than this sub ever could.

Well I was thinking if I was with a doctor I would be guaranteed pharma grade. I'm not sure how insurance works out for TRT if it would help or hurt to do it legally or blackmarket.\n\nI simply figured if I ever wanted to blast I would just buy the "extras" on my own but I didn't even think about the doctor controlling my levels and insurance being a hurt than a hindrance.\n\nGuess I've gotta bit more research to do on ancillaries and what I need "just in case" for a cycle. \n\nExcellent points. Thanks.
Yeah I've been here for years just figured I'd wait til I graduated before I started using. Just didn't expect my dick would randomly stop working properly.\n\nGonna get a blood test by this weekend then set up my cycle from there it looks like. \n\nThanks for the help brother.
What's wrong with a suicide cut if muscle is preserved?\n\nIs the metabolic damage that severe? How is it quantified?
Hmmm. Well color me wrong then. \n\nApologies gentlemen
Well yeah u/0kool74 that's why the redpill exists. Guys with high SMV don't need much game awareness because the game is already in their favor.\n\nEspecially when it comes to strictly sex.\n\nYeah a few top 10% guys might get screwed over in relationships but it's not as drastic as this subreddit would have you believe. Every good looking guy is not some clueless moron who will lose his job, house, kids, and money to any woman that fucks him. \n\nNatural alphas actually don't get taken that easily because they truly have abundance mindset and options. They also have experience dealing with attractive women from a young age. They cheat, they dump girls, they leave, they walk away. \n\nThe idea that good looking guys can't keep women or get exploited by women is nothing but a masturbatory fantasy redpill guys tell themselves to feel better about the fact that the same woman that approaches an alpha and throws her pussy at him, he will have to go through 50 shades of game to even get a blowjob.
How much would it cost to airdrop pamphlets from the sky WW2 style, with 10 clear points on why marriage sucks for men?? \n\nIt's 2017. We have the internet. Why are guys in the western world STILL trying to get married??!?!!

Wtf you're 16 you young punk.\n\nJust eat properly and get 8 hours of sleep a night for the next 10 years. You'll probably end up at least 5'11"
> success came to him the way it would if anyone lived their lives with such disregard of societal boundaries.\n\nLOL are you kidding me?! \n\nWhat about the other millions of men in prison or on the streets or dead because they "lived life the way they wanted"? Are you fucking joking me?\n\nJeremy Meeks criminal history is a part of his rise to fame. A rise to fame that NEVER would have happened if he wasn't a mixed guy with blue eyes, 6 ft tall, and godlike facial aesthetics and teardrop tattoos. \n\nI mean are you fucking kidding me?! His genetics are the REASON for his rise. When his mugshot was all over the news and internet a year or two ago it was because women were literally getting wet by just looking at him.\n
> That's like setting your toddler free into the street without any sort of number or ID.\n\nI usually keep mine on a leash
That's because the red pill is about SELF-prioritization and putting your own happiness first.\n\nWomen are more redpilled than men because they're naturally more selfish. They act on what best benefits THEM. \n\nBlue pill men will suffer and go through trials because he thinks being selfless is a virtue. 
Been researching roids for years and I've decided to hop on. My dad's been having a lot of health issues lately and he's a Muslim who never drinks, never did drugs, eats healthy, and usually works out twice a week doing light cardio. \n\nDespite living a straight edge lifestyle he still ended up with liver issues and a couple other health issues.\n\nI'm not going to live my life in fear of what is basically a roll of the dice. I plan to use as smartly as possible but I'm not going to be crippled by "what if". Millions of people each year get sick or get killed because of simple bad luck. \n\nOrdered my bloods already and after I get my bloodwork back will probably start researching sources and slowly collecting my testosterone and ancillaries to have until I'm ready to actually do my first pin which will probably be months from now. \n\nWish me luck boy-o's. The natty card will be turned in by year's end.

Lol I've been slowly "permabulking" for 2 years now. Also working full time while completing my degree.\n\nNothing wrong with it if you know how to bulk properly and can eat in a surplus without turning into a lardass. I look smaller in my arms and delts right now despite having put on 20 lbs in the last 2 years. Must be the fluffiness. But I've never once gone over 16% bodyfat so I'm not worried or feeling fat.\n\nI'm going to do my first cut in 2 years in a month or two. \n\nWe're all gonna make it bro.\n\nAlso you shouldn't be feeling lonely make at least some time for friends/family every week.
Already served. Have fun guys
Yeah like the selfless men who die in wars for banks and oil companies and politicians and generals.\n\nThe selfless employees who work their ass off to meet deadlines and don't get a bonus at the end of the year\n\nThe selfless student who works hard on a group project while others coast by\n\nBeing selfless is not a virtue and is a lie told to young men so they will gladly go die in a war of aggression, or be a slave to his job, or do whatever it is that society needs that beta male to do so the alphas can enjoy their superiority and keep the machine spinning. \n\nDon't ever doubt it and don't ever forget it.
Marriage honestly sounds like a bloody nightmare to me at age 26. \n\nI can't imagine why any man would willingly sign up for it in today's day and age. Like I mentioned if the guy had kids it's one thing, but since he doesn't he needs to cut his losses.
> Single mom that has a son at the school I work at offered to hook up with me a few times a week. \n\nLOL wtf? Maybe you have a weird writing style but do people actually do this/talk like this? Why does this sound like a business transaction or a free offer?\n\nDid she send you a coupon for sex 2-3x a week? Did she send you a marketing email? \n\nDid she formally request you to dick her down lol Idk why the way you phrased it sounds so weird. \n\nedit: this story sounds weird cuz she just offered sex and OP offered no backstory of flirting or vibing beforehand. like she simply saw him and asked "can we hook up 3x a week?". What's the story here OP?\n
lol I don't look like shit I look great and know how to lift and have done it consistently for half a decade\n\nnice try insecure weak faggot
That's what happens when the entire economy is based off oil and gas. Funny thing is I remember someone online on city-data.com saying Houston stands up to recessions easier because of the oil industry and had to shake my head.... Clearly they lacked a fundamental understanding of economics.\n\nThat being said I'm an LA native who is looking to move/invest in either Houston or Atlanta in the next year or so. If the jobs tank and people flee the area, real estate should be ripe for the picking in a downturn. \n\nNot to be insensitive but definitely good for real estate investment if property prices drop. As long as they eventually bounce back up...
I'm about to turn 26. I'll be on before years end. \n\nThough everyone's different do it when you feel ready.

Simple. Thanks.
lmfao this is horrible advice and just total bullshit.\n\nwomen are the enemy when they're getting in the way of your happiness and peace of mind.\n\nalso women do not want sex as much as men that's stupid as fuck. this can be medically and psychologically documented. Not only do women 30-70 have higher cases of low libido, their low libido cannot be cured with Viagra or testosterone and is not a simple result of erectile dysfunction or low test like it is with men. Also, women are more content not having sex than men are. Again this is basic scientific fact.\n\nthe problem is when a woman can't be bothered to have sex with you, she doesn't give a fuck about your happiness or wellbeing. that's bullshit and a man shouldn't suffer for it, especially when the woman can't be assed out enough to address it. \n\nmore men need "TRP bullshit" to avoid situations like these where they're in sexless relationships and unsatisfying marriages.

Look at their beginning pics. Most of em are DYEL chubsters in their first pics. They probably suck at training tbh.\n\nTestosterone clearly works if you know how to train and if you look like shit already it can only help so much.\n\nI don't know about y'all but when I turn in my natty card I will be checking in some serious fucking gains in that first year of blast and cruise.

> Too many men living without options, without abundance, without having had a wide array of sexual experiences with different women which would open their eyes as to what is possible before settling down.\n\nThat's not the only problem but it is a major one. The problem is most women are simply not marriage material. A woman who is a whore is not marriage material. Period, point blank. A woman who has been fucked by tens of guys is not marriage material. A woman who is not submissive is not marriage material. A woman who prioritizes career over family is not marriage material. A woman who isn't excited about raising kids is not marriage material.\n\nThat just excluded like 80% of American women. Women these days don't want a marriage they want a wedding. They want a big celebration of themselves and to be recognized and validated but they don't want any of the aspects of marriage that come after the wedding. They don't want to listen to a man, they don't want to immerse themselves in motherhood, and they don't want to be tied down. \n\nThe sexual compatibility comes with the fact that when women want a guy for a relationship/providing, they change the price of their pussy. So for the guy they met at the club a drink and a 5 minute uber ride to his apartment to get banged out porno style is all she needs. If she thinks a man is boyfriend/husband material since she doesn't want to appear like a whore, she will change her behavior and demand dates, wining, dining, and not put out for weeks. When the beta male finally gets pussy it's 10 minutes of missionary with no blowjob or anal. \n\nShe does this because deep down women KNOW that whores are not relationship/wife material. She's playing the role of a good woman to rope him in and he won't have the experience/"game" to see through it. She can't let him know she's truly a whore so she treats him like a faggot.\n\nThen they get married cuz the beta male doesn't have abundance like you said, and they have a dead bedroom. The beta male is wondering why he can't get his wife to fuck him, and the wife is fantasizing about the alphas she used to bang at the clubs and the frat houses but her pussy stays dryer than the Sahara for her own husband who might as well be a walking paycheck.\n\nShe doesn't submit fully to her husband, the husband is never satisfied or happy, and you have the 50% divorce rate and the unhappy marriages we see today.\n\nThe whole system is fucked.\n

Excellent point. There's a balance and of course there's levels to this shit. \n\nBut overall I agree with you. \n\nSelf-deprecation should never be relied on but it also shouldn't be feared.
I don't get it...? Why does your girlfriend want to watch a stupid children's movie?
Yeah the "on screen" persona is based on "on page" persona. Not Elon Musk. \n\nMusk is hardly a witty, arrogant, extravagant playboy. He's just tech billionaire. Similarities end there.\n\nThe "on screen persona" is not based on Elon Musk. It's based on other interpretations of Stark.

Godfuckingdammit. This weekend I wanted to get a few things done including bloodtest from a lab and filing my taxes online.\n\nWas going to call the lab to see if I could come in since I already had my bloodtest paperwork ordered and paid for but they closed at 11:30 am and I saw this at 11:00am. I thought I'd have all afternoon.\n\nThen I try to file my taxes and I'm missing some of my proof of health insurance I thought I'd filed away. I had to make sure I had 5 different W-2's (I had 5 jobs last year) which was annoying, then it looks like my roommate has cleaned out where my health insurance info was. I tried to go online and the website for a major health insurance carrier is down. WHAT THE FUCK?! I call customer service and she says they can't help me til Monday when the system comes back up. So now I have to fucking wait after gathering all the bullshit documents I needed.\n\nSo yeah I'm kinda frustrated gonna hit the gym in an hour and do a back workout.
Bro. It's a scientific and psychological FACT that women don't want sex as much as men. You can clearly observe this by looking at gender dynamics.\n\nWomen only want sex as much as men when it's with the right man. Men are pretty much always horny and will bang below average women just as soon as they'll bang a hottie.\n\nWomen don't even get wet for most guys and will stop having sex in their own relationships while men will be begging their girlfriends and wives for sex and be willing to pay prostitues.\n\nYou're seriously fucking delusional if you think women want sex as much as men. They don't. This is a FACT. Not an opinion.\n\nI understand what you're saying obviously women wanna fuck but to say it's equal to men is fucking stupid. Sex is cheap to women. It's not something women think about "getting" because it's easy as breathing for them to get fucked by a man. \n\nIn addition, women often feel like they want to get something out of sex. Commitment, money, status, whatever. Most women don't like to have casual sex which is why you have women who feel like sluts if they get pumped n dumped. Because deep down their vagina is something transactional. \n\nThat's also why when women talk about sex they talk about how their vagina is "worth it" as if it has a price tag for a man's time, money and energy.\n\nIf women wanted sex as much as men, society would fucking crumble as we would all be having sex all over the place all the time. I mean think about what you're saying. You're a fucking man so you should know how men are. Imagine if women would EQUALLY reciprocate the same horniness.\n\nI mean I know the hip and cool thing to say for guys is that women want sex equally and that guys who don't think that are sexless losers but think about the claim you're making. It's absolutely nonsensical.
She sounds ungrateful, lazy, entitled, bitchy, unpleasant, and disrespectful.\n\nDump that bitch.
Keep in mind that low cost of living usually means lower wages. So $150,000 could be more than you can afford in that region. 
> Things are generally good with the wife, we still go out and do stuff etc. but nothing sexual ever happens. \n\nThings are not good then! I repeat, **things are NOT fucking good**.\n\nIf you're in a relationship without sex, that's not a marriage. That's a friendship.\n\nIf you have no kids cut your losses and just leave. \n\nMarriage sucks for men in the western world. Women have no obligation to give the one thing that men need in a relationship, sex. I'm not even talking about being nurturing, kind, supportive, gentle, cooking, cleaning. I'm talking about just lying down an opening their legs. \n\n90% of marriage problems could be solved by the woman simply giving two blowjobs a week and having sex a couple times a week.\n\nWe seriously need to airdrop pamphlets from the sky on how marriage is a scam. Unless you're HELL BENT on starting a family just don't get married. Even then, there's loopholes and ways around that.\n\nI truly do not understand how in 2017, with the internet available, men in the western world don't understand how shitty a deal marriage has become.\n
r/marriedredpill
I believe it's part of their ritual/belief system. The elites believe they have to reveal their plans/agenda to us. Some speculate that it's a way for the elite to gain our "consent" to be ruled over though I don't buy that.\n\nThey're programming us. Hollywood is a magic spell to control the planet. It's literally mind control on a PLANETARY scale. Even little kids in Africa are watching these movies. \n\nThere's a conspiracy that the Zionists created Hollywood to control the minds of the world. The city is called "Hollywood" because holly is a tree with magical properties and connotation. Holly is also known as the tree of sacrifice.\n\nAnyways that's a whole other tangent but I truly believe Hollywood is an evil dark place full of pedophilia, homosexuality, and that it's the base for mind control and psychological conditioning on a planetary scale.
90% of "Christians" don't actually follow the religion in the first place. The kickback we're seeing is from the 10% that still do.

How do I go about setting an appointment to get checked out by a doc and possibly getting on TRT?\n\nI'm about to turn 26 and out of nowhere a month ago my libido went to absolute shit. I could barely keep an erection with a fine girl in my bed begging for it (no condom) and now for the past few weeks, I no longer get random erections at all. My libido has gone to shit. No random erections, no morning wood, can't perform when I have a girl, threw some porn on last week to force myself to get a boner and didn't even wanna jerk off. I feel like I'm trying to force or trick my dick into staying hard. Usually I'm pretty damn horny.\n\nI'm a natural lifter, been lifting for over 5 years. 5'7" (5'9 on Tinder), 182 lbs, 14-16% bodyfat.\n\nMy physique is well developed and my diet and training are pretty consistent. I definitely look like I lift and I should be getting enough sleep and enough dietary nutrition to have normal libido. I have well balanced diet heavy on protein with lots of fats from meat, eggs, cashews/almonds every morning, and even fish.\n\nI've been forcing myself to get at least 6 hours a night though aiming for 8. \n\nAlso I'm bald and have been bald since highschool. Started receding at 16, by 19 it was so bad I just started shaving it completely. Not sure if that means anything about T.\n\nI have health insurance through my job and I wanna set an appointment ASAP to either get some damn Cialis so I can fuck or get on TRT.\n\nHow do I go about seeing a doctor to get checked for this stuff? Is there a certain type of doctor or clinic I need to go to? I don't have a regular doctor and have never used my health insurance before (fairly new job).\n\nAlso what should I do before a blood test to drop my levels lower? I don't want to get denied for being on the cusp of a barely functioning man. I'm a 26 year old who lifts and diets properly I don't want to be walking around in the "acceptable range" with the same amount of test as a 60 or 70 year old man. Fuck that. \n\nAdvice?\n\n
Life gains. Fucking nice.
12-16 week cycle is the standard bruh\n
Nice.\n\nI saw my gym crush on Saturday and absolutely pussed out even when she smiled/waved at me. Fuck it's annoying I can usually approach random women but the ones I actually like I get crippling anxiety\n\nThis chick could be my next ex-wife
He said kg. Not sure what that translates to in freedom units though so he could still be weak
Does Roelly have the best arms in the game right now?
> Natty going on roids for the first time.\n\nIs it also your first time lifting? You need to cut before you start your cycle your bodyfat is fucking high.
Upvoted for visibility.\n\nIf it's banned it's clearly dangerous and probably has lots of truth
> sometimes after the kids leave the nest the sex returns full force\n\nAhhh just what I've always dreamed of. Finally being able to have a great sex life again in my 50s with my 50 year old wife after years of a dead bedroom \n\n> it is nice to have that someone that you can depend upon always there for you\n\nI'm sure my father and many other men had that exact thought before their wives divorced them and took them for everything they were worth\n\n> It is not all bad. \n\nIt probably isn't. Until it is all bad. Now I don't mean to be negative or cynic but I just can't trick myself into thinking marriage is a good choice. \n\n> Fun fact: Just received my order of cialis and am looking forward to the weekend.\n\nEnjoy it killer
> Don't think he's a "cuck" because he has morals\n\nWTF? How is not sleeping with a woman "moral"? How is it immoral to bang women?\n\nLmfao. \n\nUnless you're basing your "morals" on the Bible I don't see how that can even be justified.

Because your trying to keep up with everyone else. It's like being 16 and hammering some whiskey. You ain't ready yet son. A couple hits and let it ride man

Looks like an old shallow well pipe. Probably 1 1/4" driven well with a pointy screen tip on it. It's likely the foot valve is bad or the pipe has holes so it loses prime every time. It never hurts to try a hand pump on it though.\nSource: Well driller for years
Lol. Ok
You're going to learn alot about mama
Ok I'll just list some off the top of my head\n\n1. Your marriage is likely to fail. With 50% of marriages ending in divorce and 70% of divorces initiated by women, chances are highly probably your wife will divorce you.\n\n2. You will get taken for most of your shit in a divorce. Family courts almost always heavily favor women. She'll take everything you've spent years working for and she'll take your dignity with it. Depending on how long you stay married you could end up not only losing your house, car, business, etc but you could end up paying alimony til the day you DIE. \n\n3. Your wife was not a virgin before you married her. studies show that the more partners a woman has, the less ability she has to successfully pairbond with a new mate. This is drastic from 0-1, and 1-2 partners and gets worse from there. \n\n4. Women get fat in marriages. The hottie you married today will be a whale in a few years\n\n5. Married women stop having sex with their husbands. Whether its the kids, stress from work, or other reasons, your sex life will diminish. Many guys get married and think "awesome I get to have sex with my wife everyday!" WRONG. Many married men have less sex than other demographics\n\n6. Lack of spending freedom. You're married now and have to ask permission before you can spend your own hard earned money. \n\n7. Lack of sexual freedom. You're married now and all the other women are off limits even if your own wife won't fuck you.\n\n8. With feminism, many women expected to be treated like equals even when they clearly aren't. Many women feel things like housework, cooking, cleaning, taking care of kids, etc is SLAVERY. No more gender roles! \n\n9. You no longer have solitude and peace. You have a wife. She will constantly be there when you get home. She'll come with you on vacations. You'll go out and do battle with society to make money and put bread on the table, then you'll come home and fight another battle on the home front. She's bored. She's not happy. She's unappreciated. She wants attention. Etc. \n\n10. Marriage is being a man on hardmode. Everything dealt with in a regular relationship is amplified. You can never rest. It takes a toll on some men.\n\nNow if the above don't apply to you, enjoy your marriage. You're a statistical outlier. \n\nThat's my opinion and I'm sure other men could say it better but I don't think any western man should get married in today's current social and economic climate. I'm not really sure what a man GAINS from getting married anymore. 
I've always hated Sadik's midsection.

> Houston historically may not have the largest index, but it doesn't change much despite economic ups and downs.\n\nIt does when the O&G industry fluctuates. That's my point. It was good in the recession when oil was strong. Now that oil isn't as strong the whole city is feeling it. \n\nIt's a double edged sword. \n\nAnd what happens if another recession or depression hits AND oil is weak? 
> I mean Elon Musk was like the literal influence for Marvel's on screen 'Tony Stark'.\n\nUhhh Tony Stark's persona has existed since before Elon was born. Saying Musk was the influence for it because he's a tech billionaire is a stretch.
No such thing as an ex-Marine\n\nThough I agree I wouldn't necessarily brag about or even mention my service if I was kicked out for fighting a superior.
Went great. Crushed back, hit a few bicep exercises and looked great in the mirror (I was wearing a Gold's stringer hehe). Made sure to get a good stretch on my rhomboids/traps with the seated cable row and did some weighted pullups with a 25 lb plate attached. Was kinda disappointed in my stamina/endurance for the weighted pullups but my pullups have been extremely difficult the last few months as I've gained more weight. Hovering between 179-183 lbs I'm the heaviest I've ever been in my life (5'7") but I'm still fairly lean. I'd say 14-16% bodyfat.\n\nI'm fucking kicking myself though I saw my gym crush and failed to act on it AGAIN. FUCK I'm such a damn doofus. I was in the middle of my workout doing hyperextensions and I see her squatting on the smith machine. I strategically go to the water fountain by the smith machine and she waves hi to me but I didn't approach her and I waved back. I should have fucking just tried to talk to her.\n\nFuck I can approach women all day at clubs, bars, and coffee shops but I can't do it at the gym... The mix of people being on machines and having headphones in makes it awkward. \n\nThis chick is a goddess I would NOT pull out if I was fucking her. Annoying thing is she always comes with her sister usually and that's my excuse not to approach but today she was by herself. \n\nI fucking kick myself for not talking to her everytime I'm so disappointed in myself I have to get over this and talk to her. We give each other the acquaintance wave/hello everytime we see each other and I NEVER act on it.
> "blackmamba329, my goal is to have your body."\n\nWell.. Did you give it to him?
I've been there as well. It sucks. \n\nThe world needs betas to operate smoothly so the rest of society can enjoy quality of life. \n\nBut in any society on the planet you have the people at the top who exploit others and the people on the bottom who get exploited and taken.\n\nThis is as true in the United States as it is in Nigeria.\n\nThe difference is the western world has created such prosperity and infrastructure even the lower class here live better than the middle class of most other places.
Thanks. 
That's how I look at a date.
> My gf kiss/sucks my dick goodmorning every day. \n\nShe no longer has to do that once she has a ring on her finger, your last name, and half your assets.
> women are NOT men and shouldn't be judged as such\n\nTell that to the rest of western society\n\n
> I will keep my test levels between 1k and 2k whether blasting or cutting \n\nI sincerely hope you meant to say whether bulking or cutting and you don't mean whether blasting or cruising. 
Palmer has a game like this every once in awhile. The thing is, he usually has a couple TDs as well. He reminds me of Curt Warner in that aspect. I owned him in his Cardinals days too

I've found water lines with this method using 10 gauge copper wire. Idk if it works on something deeper. It didn't work for me until I held them right. Don't grip the wires. Let the weight of the long ends create a wedge effect on the wire in your hands. I learned it from my friend who's grandpa did excavation all his life. 
The article I saw was from The Sun which is a sketchy source to start and The Sun was reporting on an article from a Russian tabloid. So basically one tabloid quoting another.  Maybe a Russian here could help sort this out.
It's a slippery road that your on. If reddit teaches you too much it's going to be a wild ride!
Agreed. Listen to how the networks are spinning it right now. Polls could be wrong? Minorities are scared?  I'm still on the fence. Feels wrong.

That's not how they plan. I don't think Trump was plan A but there was definitely a plan with him winning. These people plan for every situation and they can change those plans mid-election.

I'm talking about the people who say holistic medicine is fraudulent. I agree with you on the election bullshit. We have had an influx of new folks lately because of politics though. I think this is good that we have a chance to open their minds even more. So I'll take the bad with the good for now.

Who do the farmers use in your area? Almost always the best deal. We don't own our 500 gallon tank and yes, we have to use them to refill it. There's no rental fee and no delivery costs or other bs. Every time I refill, they are the cheapest too. If not I'd  just call and tell them to come get it cuz I was switching companies. There's 4 in my area. It's that simple if there's no contract involved. Maybe your area is different though.

My only advice is if you get a job now, save all of your money while living with your parents for a couple more years. Then, go buy a house or a piece of land out in the country. You'll find out who you are then...and you'll know what you have to do. I never want to work anywhere again, except on my land. It's the best feeling in the world for me.

I feel like so many people that are going against the idea of pedogate simply haven't read enough on it. I'm saying nothing concrete, but one does have to do some dot connecting. Than again, if you don't believe, you don't. Simple as that.
Yeah, cmon man you were gonna get rid of those and anyways. Just saved you some time.
I agree with you., although if the cave in happens with a constructed/thin rock roof the outside will be exposed. I'm pretty certain all the cells in OP's cave are overhead mountains though. OP even contradicts himself in a way with the imgur album descriptions. Asserting first that the temp will stabilize too low, but then proceeding to do just that.
Srsly, seeing these responses makes me sad. The whole ordeal was just drama, blown entirely out of proportion. I think Tynan handled it fine. It's a little unreasonable to expect perfect simulation of sexuality in a damned video game, on top of how volatile a topic that is in today's world already. Also it was freakin' RockPaperShitgun reporting it.

This is just a little gripe I've had with this song, but in Drake's verse he says,  \n  \n"She was sitting down on that big butt  \nBut I was still staring at the titties though"  \n  \nWouldn't it make more lyrical sense to say "sitting there" instead of sitting down since 'there' and 'stare' have a rhyme to them? I'm not saying I'm right, just something that stood out to me in the song.
Go on! Get outta here ya stupid animal!
When I stopped watching wrestling, I was like 14 in 2007, John Cena had held whatever title RAW had for, like, forever.

No srsly, OP got a nice shot off for sure. But, if his enemy hadn't just flat out missed it would be an entirely different story. I get OP's title referencing how all widows seem to go for the hookshot shot, and he had good forethought to setup for it, but even though he did all that matters is that the first guy missed.

Thank you! For anyone else having this issue this is the answer. +1 m8. I must have tried to open that incognito window a little too early haha.
+1 for recommending going into modding. Definitely do it to some extent. JeSuisOmbre here is right, a lot of them are simply exta QoL features that wouldn't effect the game at all. It's usually just the work of reading through them all since there's lots, but the steam workshop has made it a lot more accessible.

You can only heat/cool enclosed spaces so I think that wouldn't work. It probably checks outside temps which you can't control.

Ill bet if you made a (semi)big post about it with some work done people would get into it. This sub is still kinda small so I feel like you'd have to do a lot of the work.

Despite the conclusiveness of this post's findings, there will always be this: https://i.redd.it/xvnlon3jhnby.png
It's also important to remember that he is a victim of pedophilia not a pedophile. I do not agree with what he said. It's horrible. But he's not even being accused of a crime. He's also made numerous statements condemning it today... and as he's said he's actually exposed 3 pedos already.
True 'satan' is a red herring... The word satan is actually a title meaning 'to stand against'. Its only a tool in the false religion control system... The so-called gods of Abrahamic-Mesopotamian religion/mythology (including the Old Testament) were extraterrestrial. And although many of these contributed to our current genetic physical makeup, they are not to be worshipped.\n\nThe God that Jesus and other ascended maters speak of is the Source of All... the Universe, the greater field of consciousness and everything in it, which Jesus embodied as 'oneness' or absolute love. The negative groups co-opted these divine truths to make a system of fear, separation and moral contradiction.\n\nAll satanism and luciferianism relates to manipulation by demons/archons (or negative ETs) and a larger system that has been coordinated by a plasma-based being called 'Lucifer' (Yaldaboath in Gnostic teachings). The Cabal-Illuminati groups recognize various individual demons by name, and a few negative ET groups as well. \n\n
Not familiar with her... just looked and found some interesting stuff. Will check it out, thanks!
This guy is fast asleep.
Something definitely happened to him after speaking out. I think the UCLA / reprogramming story makes a lot of sense given all that we now know about this now. The Kardashians are probably also used as tools in a celebrity psi-op program, which would explain the non-stop media saturation with them.\n\nI also think there is a possibility that the most famous and most influential people could be subjects of human cloning... \n\njust look at the events of 9/11/16, where Hillary collapse at the 911 Memorial - her death was reported on the news - Then she reappears later in the day with a completely different body type and face. https://youtu.be/lD7-naYIDyA
Interesting theory... INR is State Dept, giving intelligence support to U.S. Diplomats... If true, it could also be directly related to Tillerson purging the State Dept. / 7th Floor group.\n\nEdit: Tillerson not Mattis. Thanks r13r!
I remember this to be the case as well, however it's possible these people were part of a pedo-satanist group. A 'family'.
But it's not made up... the Swedish government is really hiding the numbers. PC left are just as scared talk about crime statistics in America.
Like everything they do lately, it will backfire and just put more attention on the pedo crisis. 
I don't know whose quote that is but that is not even a remote possibility. People should know better in this sub... all major conflicts are manufactured. Allies are better than enemies. \n\nThe Cold War was a lie, as is this attempt at another.\n\n

What makes you say that? fellow of whom?
I think once the unawakened masses finally understand how bad the situation is, and what these people have done, there will be a demand for their execution. I am a pacifist but also realize the worst of them are irredeemable. They are the cause of so much suffering in this world. At the very least they should be locked away forever. But if they are executed I believe it should be lawful and with the support of the citizens. We make our stand now by continuing to make noise until other people see.
I think Milo said a disgusting thing. He is also a victim of pedophilia, who no doubt has tried to rationalize it alongside his flamboyant persona... it's messed up. I've only ever supported Milo on the issue of free speech. I think some of his opinions are harsh.\n\nI think Pizzagaters are angry that the MSM knows he's not a pedophile, yet has used his comments to distract from what the world should actually be looking at.... the stuff with Maher and Takei is just showing the hypocrisy behind the Milo attack... Pizzagaters are, and should be, only concerned with the real monsters.
You don't have to believe it to understand that they do.
Priebus likely, and other neo-con republicans I'd suspect... nothing to the extent of Hillary's group.

I do but I haven't seen any specific details... I think this is personal for Assange. I'm familiar with other former victims of these kinds of things who have become determined to expose it after breaking free.
YES!
I think using many sources is best. Everybody has a piece of the truth. For a general understanding of Satanism, I'd look at Mark Passio's work. Or Michael Tsarion... Ancient History: Graham Hancock... Scientific/spiritualism: Nassim Haramein, Greg Bradden... greater cosmic issues: The Law of One... and by extension the recent work of David Wilcock and Corey Goode.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDSOyuuSi4\n\nWill liberals show they are not hypocrites by going after George Takei next?
What's proof? Accepted scientific ideas are overturned almost daily. We can claim to understand very little of what we call reality... Rigid thinking hold you back from understanding that truth is not confined to our limited senses.
It also has to be noted that some of these names have been reused multiple times by this 'entity' or others. There were more than one 'RAs' for example... the archetype of Satan was most likely based on the Sirian Set (egypt)/Hadad (sumeria) before later being co-opted by Yaldaboath.\n\nYou're right about all the major religions worshipping this being, as it's the one one left, playing all the parts. It took over as Yahweh after those groups left the planet... This is actually what we're referring to as Yaldaboath - http://www.sciencealert.com/australian-student-confirms-that-giant-plasma-tubes-are-floating-above-earth\n\n\nIn my understanding, one (or the first) of the Yahwehs was Enlil of the Anunnaki (7th density Sirian-Orions)... Enlil was also Zeus. And it was in their lineage, the house of Anu, that we have most of the Mesopotamian gods, a few Egyptian ones but not all... There were ETs that allowed themselves to be seen as gods, and the ones to whom it happened reluctantly (like the positive oriented Sirian or Pleiadians).\n\nSo I think we're in agreement, except for the labels. For what it's worth, my knowledge comes from a Pleiadian perspective. I am Pleiadian starseed myself.\n\n\n
SHAREBLUE has written the source article, posted the article to reddit, and given themselves gold already. 
Yeah, satanic just refers to the greater system used to connect with demonic entities like Baal. It is the ritual... satan is a construct, but these world leaders actively serve Archons/demons and Lucifer through systems that could be called satanic or luciferian, depending on the group.

*The Human Fund*\n\n\n "money for people"  
I've already stated on this thread that it doesn't matter the political label... the Bushes are pedos as were many in their circle... just as the Clintons are... neo-libs and neo-cons are exactly the same.\n\nYou want to talk specifics about sex scandals, get specific. I don't care about any of them. They are all connected.
Yes it is real. They are not just bored.\n\nThis is a cosmic situation. Light and dark. You don't need to be religious to understand it but you do need to be spiritually minded. We are talking about dimensional realities beyond our common 'senses'.... ET's and Inter-dimensional beings, both positive and negative. We have been manipulated by negative forces for thousands of years and this is allowed to happen because of free will... because we allow this to happen.\n\nThese satanists are slaves to parasitic entities. The act of blood ritual and traumatic abuse is an energetic exchange for them. Most of these people are driven by uncontrollable urge, but the higher ups understand the larger context of hidden history.\n\nWe are expanding our consciousness to better understand all of this. The first step is letting go of some words and definitions as we know them... Quantum Physics is the science of Spirituality. ETs and IDs are angels and demons... Keep digging and more will be revealed as your consciousness is ready for it.\n\n
Insane... more satanic normalization. They did stumble into one insight without fully understanding it:\n\n**Christians might be offended by your assertion that the Eucharist is, effectively, cannibalism.**  Nowadays, the idea that this is the actual flesh and blood of Jesus Christ is not taken literally. But in the Middle Ages, that was not the case. Transubstantiation was believed to have taken place: The host and the wine literally became the flesh and blood of Christ. Therefore, in some sense, it was an act of cannibalism.\n\nThe eucharist is absolutely a satanic ritual and the Vatican via Roman Catholic Church is a satanic organization. Jesus is Light, but the Church is Darkness.
This is a little misunderstood in my opinion... \n\n'Christ' is a level of consciousness that Jesus obtained, reflecting absolute love. The Christ consciousness. It is non-polarization.\n\nAnti-christ is the opposite of this. It is a polarized consciousness, reflecting pain, fear, trauma etc... This is what the Cabal stands for... satanists and luciferians. Both the 'christ' and 'anti-consciousness' are choices for humanity. We must strive to be Love and to understand that we are all ONE - this was the true message of Jesus.

Now your just making things up... your accusing him of being a pedophile? \n\nI don't even support Milo, but I can see how transparent this is.
I will not call any theory ridiculous at face value. Always look deeper and learn as much as possible. There is more actual truth being discussed here any anywhere on the internet, and most of us already know that.\n\nThat said, flat earth is definitely the most damaging theory, because it was engineered to divide and confuse people. And because it doesn't seem to be going away.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who believes in inner-earth breakaway civilizations, Secret Space Program, ET interaction throughout history, etc. I've researched all of it extensively and have come to the conclusion that flat earth is just wrong.
Yes it's true... evolution of consciousness. 
More proof that high knowledge has been passed secretly from ancient times through the mystery schools of different cultures. Masonic - Greek - Egyptian - Atlantean. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/L777RhL_Fz4 Secrets in Plain Sight documentary. Geometric knowledge is also scientific and magical knowledge. There were more than a few initiates of the occult in Elizabethan England.
Very soft and very controlled... they're going to dribble these things out leading up to Antarctica... and it is ALL going to be timed to distract from Pedogate/Pizzagate revelations.
Truth. The Cabal has a co-dependent relationship with parasitic archons. That is what all the pedophilia and cannibalism is about... it's what all violence and trauma is about. This is not the true nature of man. We have been manipulated by these inter-dimensional beings for thousands of years.\n\nTake a deep dive into the subject of Archons from David Icke. There are many teachers with good information, but this subject has been around long before any of the word's major religions. This is ancient Gnostic knowledge. 
Yes. But the key is that the party lines are meaningless. They are on both sides. The two party system is a fabrication to protect the actual ruling party that never leaves.\n\nAgree about Rand Paul.
Milo on all this... pretty sure he's clear he does not support pedophilia - https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/851263248344905
It depends on the government in power... Bushes and their circle had tons of pedos... Clintons and their circles had tons of pedos. Same team, different hats.
Bushes, Clintons and Obama are major players for this agenda. Any opposition of them to anything truly dangerous to humanity is only for show - including opposition to each other.\n\nYou'll know when someone is truly a threat to the NWO when the Corporate Media aligns against them.

Even his opponents will give him credit for being smarter than that.\n\nEither he didn't know the whole truth about Epstein or he was trolling like he did with Hillary and others during the campaign... 'jokes' about Haitian villages at the Al Smith dinner for example.

Even if there was some nefarious connection to Russia - which we have not been shown... it shouldn't be a scandal. It's complete brainwashing to make people think Putin or Russians are the 'enemy'.\nNeo-libs have become Neo-cons...

Telling us to trust the CIA/NSA is absurd when you take into account what they have done. And yes, they are assassinating Russian diplomats to provoke Putin - Just like they murdered anyone who could tell the truth about the joke of scandal they tried to push against Trump. They murder anyone and everyone who gets in the way of Establishment. \n\nPeople who won't let this go are starting to look transparently dishonest if not mentally ill. You do not pick a fight with a superpower that wants to be allies because your candidate did not win the election. \n\nThe US has meddled in affairs of every country in the world.

It was a plot to fund an arms race because $$$.\n\nThe only think I'm worried about right now is that these people who can't accept a democratically elected president would sooner have another civil war then behave rationally.

I do think the globalists (especially intelligence like CIA) use radical Islam and other extremist ideas as tools to divide and conquer, not necessarily based on the merits of the ideologies. The best way to overcome these things is to expose the hidden hand that pushes these conflicts.

Yeah, absolutely. How the hell can regular people even combat that kind of influence? Could organizations like CTR be banned from the Internet without us losing some major privacy freedoms overall? Because it's not just bots, there are actual people they hire to spread public opinion. I can't exactly recommend that we as a group try to ever do something of similar magnitude and go out onto the Internet representing the opposite values, either. They either need to be put to an end by legal means or else the Internet will just turn into a wasteland of bought out opinion from both sides. 
Back in line, citizen!
No, it is not as bad as I imagined. I always welcome a calm and civil conversation about values. However, I try to research all facets of a subject, because I understand that throughout history, the unpopular opinions - whether they turned out to be true or false - are the ones that are suppressed by the forum of public opinion. One may think of the term "ugly truth." In turn, that informs my tendency to follow my intuition when it comes to researching a particular subject, and dig down under the web of popular opinion to find out what voices have been silenced.
some things are like *this* and other things are like **this**

Caspere was likely hung from the sex swing before/during his death, the coroner told the detectives that he had been hung upside down. So I'm guessing the camera was catching all of that.
You guys are awesome! I saw the "What the FUCK" as it is very stylized Lynch handwriting, but I was doubting myself with the "bowling" part. Sounds like you're spot on. Great work guys.
People don't read past the headlines anymore and their bullshit meters are way out of whack. Hence the whole fake news debacle currently.
Pretty sure he quotes the same passage from Upanishads in Catching the Big Fish.
I know right? Reminds me of Inland Empire greatly.
The only thing I can connect to this "scene" is that David Lynch did wrap up Season 3 filming with Kyle MacLachlan in Paris, shrouded in secrecy. Perhaps it was this scene, with Cole and Coop and Monica Bellucci's character. I love it.
Updating the top to reflect a new analysis of Lynch's handwriting - I am almost positive he is using Cole (not Cale) and I've deciphered "side walk cafe" based on the creperie in Paris he was photographed outside of with a film crew. Not 100% sure on if it is "He says" or "She says" at the end but judging on Lynch's style there's an arrow and then "he" in lowercase, not an un-cursived "s," and it makes more sense for Cole to respond at that time.\n\nAlso there's the matter of "(...) what the FUCK. (...) leave bowling (...) - cram to a bar." It really looks like two names - BLANK sees BLANK leaving the bowling (alley I assume is the next word) and there seems to be a "G" at the front of the line. I would imagine "Gordon" sees "Sarah" leave the bowling alley - which works if you look at it again. Although, not too sure about "cram to a bar."
Hey we're all fishing for anything to keep us alive until May :)
Hey, I agree with a lot of what you're saying. It's interesting to talk about all of this. I'm just naturally skeptical about putting an air of finality on the diagnosis of this disorder when it's based on the scientific consensus of a contentious subject that has only been researched for less than 50 years. That being said I wouldn't mind reading some sources on therapy not being successful and attempts to do so "fucking the patients up."\n\n  But anyway, as you say, seeing transgendered people compels [feelings of disgust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_repugnance) in others, sometimes masked in empathetic concern. This is relatively normal. Socially, the move toward acceptance is ultimately the right one. There's no room for discrimination against trans people. However, the innate biological feeling of disgust isn't inherently evil or *bad*. I think it's almost linked exclusively with the empathetic response. If I ever watch those exploitative plastic surgery reality shows, when I see someone with extreme body modification, like a ["cat lady,"](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YKYinnCIcVw/S-pdjqpBcyI/AAAAAAAAFOA/ZERZZkzUu4c/s1600/CelebrityPlasticSurgeryGoneWrong.jpg) I feel this deep weirdness.. It's the idea of looking in the mirror and seeing someone that's not *you*. It's one of the classic ideas in horror. No matter how much you tell yourself *it's you,* it's not you. It's one of my greatest fears. I think that spot is where a lot of the squickiness in people comes from, it's something they can't understand. \n\n  However, someone suffering from body dysmorphia (provided you think the disorder truly causes the sufferer to hallucinate bodily features inconsistent with reality) coupled with gender dysphoria could very well lead them to that exact moment, when the person in the mirror isn't who they *are*. The reaction to that could very well drive a person to body modification, to reach *who* they are. In that sense, I fully understand it. However, body dysmorphia is something that can generally be cured with cognitive behavioral therapy and some antidepressants, along with attempting to maintain a happy, healthy stable life. If fixing what's in the mirror *mentally* helps stave off the need to change what's in the mirror *physically,* than I don't see why the first steps of "transitioning" wouldn't be cognitive based. \n\n  For instance, let's say we found one-time surgery to keep anorexics around their ideal "mirror" weight, without any negative physical side effects. Would it be *right* to compel them to undergo it? To not only criticize and demonize people that question the surgery/recommend cognitive therapy to them, but to normalize and promote the idea of the surgery as the only "real" option?
This is from the Potemkine Films Twitter. What I can decipher is as follows:\n\n"(...) is on tube TV in livingroom. (...) now we enter the film and it becomes the reality. Cole has a dream of speaking with Monica Bellucci in a side walk cafe in Paris - they are discussing "We are like the dreamer who dreams - then lives inside the dream." and then Monica asks Cole "Who is the dreamer? Whose dream are we living in?" He says "Cooper was there with me but I couldn't see his face." (We see only the back of Cooper's (...) wearing his black suit.)
That's true man, I was being facetious because of the overwhelming contradictions in the public forum that I see daily on reddit. I disagree with you on the "monolithic opinion" thing because unpopular opinions are brigaded into oblivion and not really promoted within the reddit hivemind thing that happens when downvoted comments aren't wholly visible, not to mention outright deleted/censored/locked from discussion. But you're right on about the not American thing, I wasn't considering that. 
Kinda switching goalposts here. It's more akin to scarification and body modification enthusiasts. Which I even think they themselves would be like "yeah I'm pretty mental" if you asked them. But that's just because most "normies" view mental disorders as abnormal and that's kinda the crux of their entire being as circus freak types that like to show off their body mods.
Haha, thank god you performed a "psychological undressing" because your co-worker stated their opinions. Get off your fucking high horse. I would love to see the smug Facebook status that you posted after your flawlessly executed psychological undressing. For all your open-mindedness, you sure seem to hate people stating contrary opinions to yours.

I'd recommend the [Skeptic's DIctionary entry on MPD](http://skepdic.com/mpd.html) just for a quick overview of the skeptics and defenders of the disorder. Sources at the bottom of the page. It's all very interesting at the least.\n\n Regarding your second point,  there are a lot of people that are in that same camp of not giving a fuck about "what is a mental illness and what isn't" but science can't really just go by that. You can still call it a mental illness while being supportive of the sufferer to do everything they can to make themselves happy/better. I just would think that, like with most mental illnesses, the first step would be therapy and medication before physical intervention.\n\n  Take the case of the schizophrenic. We do not encourage the schizophrenic to descend into a world of intrusive, possibly malicious, thoughts in which they can hardly find themselves. Nor do we lobotomize or trepan them. We give them therapy and medication. Lobotomization would no doubt allow in the schizophrenic sufferer to, in a way, *be happy.* But most, if not all, would only resort to lobotomization as a final step - or in today's world, never even broach the subject. Mental issues must be taken care of first, long before physical alterations are introduced.

Seriously, holy shit I'm astonished at this comment chain. Reminds me of *crimestop* from Orwell's 1984.\n\n> The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself.

> "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. [...] They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."\n\nHe thinks that within the population of illegal Mexicans in America, "some" are good people, but the majority of the people Mexico would "send" would be there to commit crime. I don't understand the implication of a country "sending" illegal immigrants, it probably happens to a certain degree but I would assume that Mexico itself doesn't govern over a lot of the illegal immigration. Legal immigration, sure.  Somebody that breaks the law (illegally entering the country) has successfully exhibited little regard for law. There are legal pathways to come to America. But anyway I don't think that he means that the entire population of Mexicans in the world breaks down to that same 60/40 split of rapists and good people. I think he just means illegals stay illegalin'

Well, I for one hate republicans because of their skin color. Go on, you can admit it too.
Morocco doesn't have mandatory hijab, but it's a ~99% Islamic culture - do you not think cultural pressures are a thing in regards to the level of conservatism in women's clothing? Or is there something else you'd like to educate me about?
They're not legally mandated to dress like that, they're just under extreme societal and familial pressures to maintain an image of devout chastity that the males aren't held to. My bad!
I feel like people had already figured that out before Darwin..
American's aren't killers? Could you remind me, who was it that drove out the Native Americans? Can't have your "Columbus was a white genocider" cake and eat it too.
From what I understand, the dominant religion of Zanzibar, where this photo was taken (not that it matters because Zanzibar is 98.9% Muslim according to the 2002 Census, matching Morocco's 98.9% Muslim population in 2010) designates head coverings as a conservative dress. This constitutes a "cultural law" so to speak.\n\nJust as in America, 70% Christian, you can easily imagine the picture of their "good Christian boys and girls" - but around their teenage years the men are generally less pressured by society to keep up appearances in regards to their purity and sexuality than the women are. \n\nHowever, the "culture" of the United States is a little less dominantly coded as Christian compared to Morocco or Zanzibar in regards to Islam. 20% of the population in America being irreligious is simply non-existent in a place like Zanzibar, and around 7% in Morocco. On top of that, Christianity does not designate head coverings as a conservative clothing with the exception of clergy members. \n\nSo, you get one society that has the baseline of: ~99% of young women are under pressure to cover their hair, as well as arms, legs and cleavage. The other society has the baseline of: ~70% of young women are under pressure to cover just their arms, legs and cleavage. From the baseline, the first society's young women that stray from conservative clothing reach the point of exposing their hair, arms and legs, and some point along the line they become "non-conservative" and therefore lose the illusion of purity and dignity that is prized among the conservatives that dominate the culture. With the other society, the young women that stray from conservative clothing reach the point of exposing their arms, legs and cleavage, at which point they also become "non-conservative" and lose the illusion of purity and dignity that is prized among the conservatives that dominate the culture. The key difference is the level of Religious dominance in the culture.\n\nI would argue the 70% Christian group, taking into account of exposure to alternate ideas living in a society of 20% irreligious people, would be quicker to stray from conservative principles, and in turn be greeted by a society that didn't outright shun them. However, with a ~99% Christian culture, you might see something a little like Puritanical shaming happening to women all over again.\n\nWhen you say "they don't have to though...." it's ignoring thousands of years of cultural and familial pressures that are weighing on these women, and the men in their culture are basically exempt of these pressures.
Fuck off, creep. Deal with the fact that the Protocols are falsified documents and come back with something else
Lol, you thought the boss was a dude.

I guess if you're giving me two options for how I "feel" (which no doubt reflects your view of an individual's worth being defined by **one** thing) I would say hate. I read something that was irritating to me. I read the words "I had to do a psychological undressing."  It just so happens that I *hate* it when people put themselves on a pedestal just because they see or feel that somebody else is misinformed. It's not your calling in life to teach people morals. Worry about yourself. What feeling were *you* feeling when you posted? Because I can hardly label the level of braggadocio I would have to experiencing to even consider the action of performing a "psychological undressing" of a co-worker, not to mention brag on Reddit about it afterwards. The average person in America is misinformed about something or other, and that's their ignorant-ass right. They don't need you running around harassing them for thinking some backwards notion. \n\n  And please, everybody, don't forget to only point out how I'm doing the same thing that I'm ranting about in this post, don't provide a valid retort.

First we get a clue from MIKE about meetings of supernatural beings that take place above a convenience store:\n\n"We lived among the people.\nI think you say, convenience store.\nWe lived above it.\nI mean it like it is... like it sounds."\n\nThen in Fire Walk With Me, - Philip Jeffries (David Bowie), who has been missing for the past 2 years, says "I've been to one of their meetings.  It was above a convenience store." in a scene that is interspersed with terrifying visions of the meetings, above the convenience store. In the script, Lynch [refers to the scene as "ROOM ABOVE THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY"](http://www.lynchnet.com/fwwm/fwwmscript.html). \n\nI agree with /u/CarnageV1, the full version of the meeting is fucking bone-chilling. Definitely some of the scariest bad trip imagery to ever be put to film.
What is the significance of 42? And did your grandfather have information or knowledge of Operation Paperclip?

UBI would reduce a lot of crime but not all of it. Thats an important distinction to make. Another thing to keep in mind is it does not matter how much money you have, but rather how much you can buy with it. 100$ aint shit if you are paying 10$ for bread. The problem that's always over looked with min wage and what not is the attributed value of things. What if we made a law were products were mandatorily 5% cheeper than current market price and put in barriers to stop companies from over charging to compensate?
No I remember them giving obama shit when an American kid was killed in an assassination. I think the reason they are concerned now with trump is because he's legitimately unqualified and should not be authorizing these things. Its actually fucking terrifing. Obama at least had a professional qualified additude about his indiscriminate bombing. I never felt like WWIII was gonna break out at any moment when Obama was pers. Doesn't mean I like the guy but he was better at his job. 
And this folks in the pinicle difference between a Democratic Republic and a Nationalist Dictatorship.

https://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com\n\nPeople should research and debunk the information themselves before lynching r/the_donald. As with all things, there is some truth and some falsehood. A well informed individual will entertain both sides of the argument to utter exhaustion, then decide for themselves what the truth is. Not immediately discrediting something because those that promote the idea are the opposition to your personal ideology.
As much as Id like to believe its a restaurant decoration or just some obscure over-sized load, I don't find that reasonable. I have never once seen a truck with and escort of a dozen police vehicles, and nobody in this thread has provided an explanation to what that shape is. Some might say that the government wouldnt risk having a UFO be seen in public but people see real UFO's all the time and doubt their own eyes. WE are trained by the media to not acknowledge what our own senses tell us. I'm not saying that this is an alien space craft but it is overly suspicious whatever it is.
Just like the gestapo. 
Pretty cool.
That hardly debunks anything. He just cherry picked info relevant to his point of view and then gave an opinion about it. I would consider this video to be just as useless as the numerous YT videos trying to support Pizzagate.\n
That not what I's saying. What I want is the truth, just like you. But to immediately label something a Hoax because its sounds out of this world is not how you find the truth. I don't know what going on, nor have I claimed to. But anyone with an unbiased view of the matter can see something really dubious is at work here. If you know any pedophilia terminology or symbols its obvious. There is evidence, but you may need to have an understanding of RSA to see it. i can supply information relevant to this statement if you wish. We can all agree that pedophilia is rampant in the highest levels of entertainment and religion. Thats a solid fact with years and years of witness testimony and trial to prove it. Just look at Jimmy Seville. He abused people for years and was buddies with all the most important people in Europe. Why would politics be any different?
Someone needs to mirror every video on his channel right now. I've got a really bad feeling about this.
Everybody knows The Beastie Boys invented punk rap. This is just cultural appropriation.

I never understood his angle until I read two of his books. He's actually a very intelligent man and his theories are not actually of his own imagination but rather accounts and stories from other people and cultures that hes mearly tied together. Although he claims he was given information of such things with the aid of a supernatural force. Personally I believe him to be attached tobwhat Terrence McKenna calls the Gaian Mind.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiEMcjSQOzg\n\nIt is true.
Ill help you out. We are one concsoiusness experiencing itself subjectivly. But in order for that to happen. The one must split into two. This is the reason for binary and dualism features in our reality. Between these two poles, is a vibration. Its what mystics call the great snake. All life and matter is an expression of this. That being said. We as humans occupy one side, and our balancing opposite occuys the other. The tension between these two is what has got us to where we are now. Man only grows in turmoil. But what is our opposite?\n\nWe inhabit the material, naturally our opposition must then inhabit the immaterial. What is the immaterial? Well, it can only be understood by what its not. That being everything not material. So the being(s) that balance us is non-physical. Think left brain vs right brain since that the embodiment of inner duality.\n\nNow, we are mammals correct? Whats a mammals biggest predator? Ill let you dwell on it. \n\nSo, what our brains do, amongst many other things, is take in and filter information. This information is then synthesized into a holographic illusion. Giving you the perception of reality. When ones synthetic hologram is reading and decoding different data from others, we call that schizophrenia. Its also why certain drugs make you hallucinate and why people can share hallucinations. What you see is real, your brains usually just filter the information out do to social conditioning of what is necessary to perceive in your current state of reality.\n\nLets say our opposition was able to make themselves material. They would have to appear in this hologram somehow? There are two ways. One is by inhabiting the body of someone receptive of their influence. The myths of exorcisms can be attributed to this. There are many ways to make ones body receptive of the signal so to speak. Some people have genetic traits that allow this to happen more easily, others are made vessels by ritualism.\n\nThe second way they could appear is by directly inserting themselves into your brains data stream. As your brain deciphers the raw information into an experience, it would read this information about an immaterial being and have to make a judgement as to what it could be. We are naturally peaceful and loving creatures so lets run through the criteria of what our opposition would naturally have.\n\nIts not friendly.\nIts predatory in some way (ill explain why it would have to be soon).\nIt means us harm.\n\nNow, your brain relies on instinct to render the hologram, so if this being was to make itself known, it would look like something thats naturally our biggest predator. Did you guess what it is yet? What do you feed rats to?\n\nBingo. They make a little sense now right?\n\nSo how can they be alive if they exist only in the immaterial. Well they need what you and me need. Energy. We get ours from food, vitamins, sex, dopamine, art, music, all material things or things that require materials to express. We have many ways to rejuvenate our minds and body. But if you dont have a physical presence, how do you gain sustenance? Through other living things of course. Vamprism. Well, what are your methods.\n\nIf we look at the heart as a battery, since it produces and ships the vital essence of our body, all batteries have a possitive and negative charge. This charge creates a magnetic field. Now to oversimplify this for the sake of understanding, If you live in a state of love(I hate that word but its the only one that works) your energy is being projected internally, to your spirit. If you live in fear (again, terrible word for it but it makes sense this way) your energy is projected outwards. Thats why we feel exhausted from worry and stress. What these beings do, is consume the energy that is emitted from fear. Its why ritual torture is needed when summoning demons.\nThey use our fears and insecurities against us to always keep up in a state thats capable of being syphoned from. Its why war and politics are a thing. Its why civilization appeared out of the blue. Its why religion is so oppressive. One must be maintained in that state to be consumed. Now what if you got a whole nation like this, or a whole planet or galaxy even. You could essentially parasite off the living to live forever in an untouchable state of being.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceburg and if you want to really understand this, it's imperative that you read david ickes work. Don't watch his videos. Read his books. They contain better information. You can get them at your library.  \n\nAlso a good read is The Illuminatus by Robert Anton Wilson. Its satire mainly but brings forth a lot of good ideas and tricks to reclaim your reality.
I must thank trump for exposing that sham that is the us government. I don't like the guy but he has made it so the game is obvious now. All these secrets are coming out and David Icke predicted this would happen around 2016 a long time ago. I think its time we all go back and look at what hes been saying. Reptilians are a hard thing to get past but he at the very least provides a good amount of evidence for their existence. Things are beginning to get really strange right now.

Maybe what your missing is that the planet has shaped and molded us humans to be its space faring spermies and has set in motion the ecological and biological events that have shaped us to be what we are now.

You misunderstand. What he's saying is in a capitalist society, where the main function of the society is the exchange currency for goods, you need a central bank or the society will crumble due to hording of capital. Thats true wether you like it or not. Thats why capitalism is prone to corruption no matter what and why the only type of socity that values people over profit is Socialism. But that has its downfall too if there is not enough capital to be distributed evenly amongst the people to the point of sustaining the economy without poverty.

I think you may be onto something but it doesn't involve the clintons. I believe this is a military trade secret and that assange is threatening to release proof of it if the 7th FBI file on clinton is not released. Same goes with the Nazi gold picture. Hes threatening to release info associating somebody serious with nazi ties. Assange is smart as fuck. I believe he started the whole #ProofofLife thing because he feared for his life after Trump won and knew we would be paranoid enough to always keep an eye out for anything suspicious. I think the police raid on the embassy was hinderrd in some way and he began to hide until trump was in power. Thats why he never stepped to the window to show us. Could have been shot by a special ops sniper sent by Obama.

The universe is built on pervious level of complexity. We are giving birth to the next species of being. Soon, humans will be obsolete. I say good riddance. People fucking suck. We are broken little creatures who should not exist on this planet any longer. For the sake of the rest of being.

No dude. You'd be surprised how many people are Nazis. Especially poor white people who believe that minority's are taking their positions in the work place.

Has anyone here actually researched the "evidence" and debunked it for Pizzagate? I see a lot of post claiming its fake but yet nobody actually challenges the evidence. They only go after r/the_donald. I get that your salty about the election but why not look at the proposed evidence. For example, one day before this happened, the traffic camera overlooking comet was moved to a position where its veiw was obstructed. Not to mention the owners twitter account is insanely suspicious. Is it not possible they are on to something? I think this sub has a bit of a bias towards this subject.
https://dcpizzagate.wordpress.com/\nIf you really want to prove your point, go through this and systematically debunk every claim made for me by using concrete evidence and avoid whatever opinioated bais you, or the writer of the atticle has on this subject.
Trump is declared savior of the human race and given unholy power to turn earth into a sadistic mega corporation that will perpetuate itself throughout the galaxy fuled by liberal tears and the cheers of thousands of little molested boys and girls. 
Can we blacklist /pol/. That board is fucking cancer.

holy shit. could you imagine if this is a tactic for pedogate?
Could be baby snatching, could be extortion ("we found traces of cocaine! Give us money! "). \n\nVery strange either way. 
So, I want to suggest something that people may be missing.\n\nA lot of hospitals automatically test for drugs. If those tests come back positive CPS has to be called due to laws and such. So no matter what is being said the mother was going to be tested for drugs anyway. Although I do believe that marijuana is not on the list to contact CPS over.\n\nBut nothing that's being said by the supposed impostor is incorrect. Nothing they are saying is indicating that the agent would be able to take the child themselves since it would be the HOSPITAL that would start the process. Unless a fake agent had a relationship with the hospital they wouldn't be able to snatch anything.\n\nIf mom is not going to test positive for drugs at the hospital there's nothing to worry about.
It sounds like you're defending the liar and probable baby-snatcher here. That's really weird. 
Wait, how is this even possible to snatch the baby? Hospital security is pretty tight. \n\nUnless she was going to attempt to take the baby out of the womb, which does happen, but not often enough for human trafficking. Last case I heard of, the mom died and the murderer/kidnapper was caught.

Crazy! Did not know.  Since it is self reported I wonder the percent of people that are truthfully answering the questions? Seems like something they could use against you if they are charging you with multiple crimes, but not something on its own that they would be able to enforce since they don't require testing.  
Once marijuana is legal, the big corporations will market it to us and keep us sedated and consuming.
Sure.. but never underestimate the laziness of people.  One could brew their own beer (I have) but the overwhelming majority get their beer at the store. 
They're relaxing the rules on weed here in Houston. It will be essentially decriminalized. The interesting part is that most people here either shrugged or went "it's about time". I haven't met anyone against it yet but I'm not active in a church or anything like that. I've heard the only people opposing it are religious fundys and the older and more extreme law & order types, but those will die out soon. In 20 years, what will be left will be the religious fundys and unfortunately, they control Texas.\n\nMost of the state wants it legal. Our government has long gone from being our representatives to being our lords. This is the problem with leaving it to the states. Why should millions of people suffer under shitty local and state governments that don't listen to the will of the people? \n\nThe war on drugs needs to end. It's the worst human rights disaster of our time, and will someday be seen as one of our most shameful mistakes.

Who is to say they won't replace the report they removed with an even more bullshit one?
To me that just sounds like "get your ducks in a row and your hand in the pie".
The question will be is he for corrupt government OR is he for good medicine? \n\nHe can not be in favor of both of them. The science is on the side of legalizing pot, to be against it is to be anti-science. 
That does NOT mean you will not get prosecuted by the feds, which still happens. I could grow pot here and the feds could take away all of my assets and put me in jail for it. It is not worth it. I will never grow until it is FEDERALLY legalized, it is not safe. \n\nThe Fed's behavior reminds me of the way the Israelis treat the people in Gaza when they talk about periodically "mowing the grass." It is the same nasty attitude. 
Erm, you can't really buy it legally as a resident in Spain. Source, live there.   There are strange smoking clubs that you have to join In a couple of cities but it's very grey area in the law.\n\nYou can grow your own legally as long as no one can see it.  You can't sell it or buy it.   If you throw a seed anywhere from may to December, water it, it will grow. It's hard to stop people growing it.  The police don't really give a shit if you just grow it  out of site for yourself.    
It's basically a weed that grows anywhere with lots of light in comparison to tobacco. \n\nHow can they sell us it when we are bound to grow it in our houses? Share seeds? People would become more social and that's the real reason it's been demonized for so many centuries and hard to get hold of... They'll never let it get popular for the masses, EVER. \n\nEven in Spain, where you can buy it legally as a resident, the police constantly wait for small time buyers to bust when they leave, and it's still not really socially acceptable. \n\nImagine when even your granny is on it, or the vicar. And it was perfectly acceptable to get high anywhere. People would begin to break down the social barriers that stress, ignorance and fear put up.\n\nIt would be a brave new world.
Sorry but by the time it becomes legal, Big Tobacco will control the market
They won't. The people that actually smoke it have more sense than to buy the bull. 
But meth is okay. God bless America. 
That's good. I thought Sessions was thoroughly against the wacky weed.

What state is this in? In Oregon people are solely smoking weed out of gun barrels. 
There are only two reasons why pot is illegal, in order to support a very corrupt government and because of religious prejudices. \n
He could be, but the DEA hasn't been chasing down drug offenders because of cues given by the DOJ. This seems like a continuation of the same policy.\n\nI guess we'll see.

The impending legalization of cannabis - which I believe will occur nationwide within the next 20 years - will present some serious investment opportunities. I suspect that those who move early in states that legalize it will have a leg-up on late comers, barring real heavy-handed federal interference later. There'll be legal weed billionaires soon enough, brand names to rival Budweiser and Marlboro. Given the banking restrictions, interstate trade restrictions, and legal uncertainty before the law is changed federally, it's unlikely that any large corporations will be getting involved early, so it's a good chance they'll be new money, too.\n\nI wonder if I can start a cannabis company ETF of some sort.
I always see these super uplifting replies in regards to why weed should be legal. \n\nPeople will be more social, happy, etc.\nHonestly I don't think it would change a whole lot. If people want to smoke, they are gonna smoke, legal or not. I doubt it's gonna bloom a batch of new smokers just because it's legal. (Though I know some that is the case for)\n\nI just don't see the big deal. I get why people want it to be legal, because the only reasons it's illegal could be seen as oppressive. \n\nI could care less. I used to smoke a few times a day. Now it makes me paranoid and uncomfortable, and I get in my thoughts and I don't plan on smoking ever again. 
So what does that mean when me and my buddy get high and go to a shooting range? How many felonies are we commiting when pot is legal in my state?
Why not get fingers in the pie? It's better than the money funding smugglers who also deal in more insidious shit.
Want to hear something funny that I learned yesterday? \n\nI'm a chronic pot smoker. I have been using it medically since late 2005. Monday I was going to go buy pot because I was out and I realized I had to renew my medical card first. So I drove over to the office to see if I could get it updated and was thrilled to see no one waiting. The nasty weather seemed to be keeping everyone at home. \n\nThey took my blood pressure and I was shocked to learn it was sky high. I was a bit annoyed with the pot doctor for aggravating my high blood pressure by asking me difficult and triggering questions about my activism instead of discussing my sky high blood pressure. \n\nYesterday I went on line and found out where I could buy a blood pressure machine. I also researched high blood pressure to see what I needed to do about it. I was worried that the pot had aggravated it so I looked that up. It turns out pot TREATS high blood pressure and chronic pot smokers like me have a rebound effect when we quit. Oh gee, the EXACT SAME THING that happens to people on high blood pressure meds who go off of them. In fact, it can cause a medical emergency. \n\nHigh blood pressure is normal at my age, I had NO IDEA I was treating it SUCCESSFULLY with pot until yesterday. If I am correct in the very wild conspiracy theory that the feds are watching my online browsing since I am such a suspicious activist, then they too may have just learned that pot successfully treats hypertension.\n\nOnce that news gets out, how will they possibly be able to argue to keep it illegal? They know what a big blabber mouth I am. They already know that I will tell everyone about it. 
They already have their fingers in that pie, might as well make it easier to see publicly

To sell/grow marijuana, you will need proper permits.  Do you understand what the going rate for such a license is?
What's the conspiracy?  This is a good thing.
Won SB50 I ain't mad  \n\nEdit: severely downvoted, still ain't mad lol.
It's not too much of a stretch to think that there'd be strict 'regulations' put in place to keep people from growing it themselves. After all, you have to make sure you're not funding the cartels and ANYONE can be a member of the cartels. Buy government/corporate-chooch and support your community!\n\n(I swear if I see this used as an argument in the future I'm going to flip my shit more than it's already been flupped)
No one admitted anything.  They should though.  I wouldn't hold my breath.  
Nope. I mean, technically you could still start a tobacco field and get in on it.\n\nBut hooks shops, head shops, and shit like that. It's gonna be big buddy m. Get a coffee shop.
If you're into fiction, it was an ok read at best.
Shot in the dark. The NRA isn't all over it because they have nothing to gain. The NRA isn't some Constitutional rights organization. They are the main arm of the gun manufacturing lobby. They really don't give two shits about the Constitution only that they can use it as a cudgel. \n\nIf they pushed the issue they alienate a lot of their supporters because I'm going out on a limb here, a lot of their most vocal supporters are also conservative. Many of whom are against legalization as well. Even if that isn't the case what would they gain? Nothing.

What you do is a PR campaign to make it disgusting to grow it yourself. If you make a brand that appears clean and sexy, you could dominate it. The real reason that Marijuana is not legal is that the DEA would lose a lot of jobs. They should not be making that decision on what drugs have no benefit. FDA should dictate this. DEA can provide reports. \n\nAn example of a possible effective PR campaign is possibly bottled water companies are trying to use political influence to manipulate local governments like Flint, possibly standing Rock's water, to make the public not want to drink from the tap so they can sell bottled water in mass.
Get in on it while it's small. You can become a big corporation if you do it when it first becomes legal in your state.
The fact that it's still illegal in most places perfectly showcases how hopelessly retarded our world is.\n\nSometimes it feels like living in south park.
I remember reading that he told Congress that if the American people want it legal they should work on drafting legislation. I can't remember where though.
I'll be sad if they do?

The fact that you think wishing violence on others is morally superior to 'racism' is deeply disturbing.  Also stop calling people racist you fucking moron.

At this point what difference does it make? Those on the left need to wait for a legitimate reason to call for impeachment, after inauguration. Trump wasn't my candidate either but you people look more ridiculous every day, now CNN is running with 4chan memes...

These are the same type of people that are critical of the U.S. under FDR rejecting Jewish refugees from Europe immediately before and during WWII. The type of persecution should be factored in to where the refugees go. Refugees from the syrian conflict can comfortably live in neighboring countries, and will easily be able to return to their homes once the war against ISIS has been won. But some of the refugees because of their religious status are persecuted in neighboring states and are under threat of being victim to genocidal actions within their home country. These refugees should have the sort of priority status because their entire legacy as a people is threatened. And because this culture is threatened, it is better for some to survive displaced than to be totally destroyed. To say it is wrong to deny accepting refugees that are from the main population would be to say that it would be wrong to deny ethnic german refugees from civilian populations during the war. This type of open door policy is far too vulnerable to both spying as well as lone actors who are willing to dispose of their lives fighting deep within enemy territory for their cause.

Well, it comes down to practice more or less, and the understanding that when the time comes for it, you can immediately hit the brakes when needing to stop, and that severe enough braking that turning would result in the inability to hold the upper body would be producing the kind of forces on the vehicle that would upset its handling characteristics resulting in an uncontrolled vehicle(particularly in automobiles that don't have traction control and ABS) in the situation.
So then the proper way to handle such situations is to require that states recognize marriages from other states, even if state law wouldn't allow the marriage to be started there.

Well considering he has Musk as an advisor, and Rick Perry did implement renewable energy infrastructure, I feel that Trump is going to have the equivalent of "Only Nixon could go to China" in terms of getting America to adopt renewables, and if you want people on the right to adopt renewable energy along with nuclear(which in my opinion is a vastly underutilized resource in nations that already have nuclear power) then the best way to justify it is through increased economic growth and energy independence for the country.
Chaos is what results in change, order exists only to reaffirm what is currently accepted.
In this case, it was illegal to burn the flag, just as much as any open burning of any item is illegal. It isn't censorship because it doesn't ban the expression of destroying a flag, only by using the means of burning to do so as such means could lead to fires that damage other people's property, the very reason that the ordinance was enacted.
Well, communism is based upon the ideal of revolution, most often instituted by export or by civil war, which leads to the genocide of the rich and anyone deemed persona non grata by the state for wrong-think. Both are forms of socialism, and where National Socialism and International Socialism primarily differ is how the oppressed class is defined. In National Socialism, the strong ethnic classes were oppressed by the weaker classes by the inhibition of their leaders, in International Socialism(Communism as defined) the strong poor class is oppressed by rich by the inhibition of the impoverished to revolt. Both are fans of mass murder, both love indoctrination, and both love the idea of conflict to redistribute the resources of the world to those that "rightfully" deserve it, while being spearheaded(or in Nazi Germany's case, speerheaded) by a wealthy authoritarian leader who stands to benefit the most from the leaders decisions.
That's the opportunity for the *finishing blow*
No no no you see it's different because Trump included exceptions for religious minorities to still get through!

Obviously the idea that from benghazi to capetown there were no traces of a civilized culture is obtuse.

Still, definition of the word "can" is pretty important.
Just like we invaded Iraq because we were ideologically opposed to Baathism, because we tried to do the same thing as de-nazification, but instead of allowing all but the highest member to escape punishment beyond losing their current job title, all members of the Baath regime were completely removed from power, and not allowed to return in any capacity, which resulted in the creating of ISIS. In fact, de-nazification promptly stopped after the U.S. realized that it was ineffective and let those who were part of the regime, but not tried for their actions, resume work for the West German government:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification#End

Yeah that's the bit that's scaring me. The very idea of using violence to censor beliefs, no matter how offensive, is contrary to the very reason you should fight against fascists.

Shh, its racist to even try and implement voter I.D., despite the fact that you could do so while increasing availability of access to citizens as a way to reach a compromise on the issue that would help work for both sides. If there is an inability of the impoverished to access I.D., then there are those in poverty that aren't taken care of because of lack of access to services that require proving identification as well as opportunities for gainful employment.
The idea that those tragedies you named and your ability to criticize or opine on them bases the idea that these were tragedies because they affected someone because of their race, and not the fact that they were individual humans that should've been given the individual right to exist as is inherent for individuals. And acting in such a manner that the tragedy is somehow worse because of their skin color is a line of reasoning that leads to further justification of tragic actions.

I mean, it's more down to a combination of greater angle of view for the night sky, as well as less light pollution and clearer skies when it comes to weather. Having lived in Arizona, most of the year had clear skies day and night, and the low density of people emitting light at night made viewing that much more spectacular, and is why I have interests in astronomy. Living in Arkansas now, the weather is much cloudier, the local populations live much more densely, and being surrounded by trees or buildings most of the time it is hard to get a full view of the night sky.

Not nearly, as saturn did not just come together all at once(and that is assuming the solar system started out as a uniform mass of gas wherein everything formed at the exact same time), but was an accumulation of material over time starting with a rocky body. Oxygen and other elements were more concentrated towards the center of the solar system. And any free oxygen left in saturn would quickly be formed into water by reacting with the free hydrogen in the atmosphere. It would be like trying to start a car with the cylinders filled 99% with liquid fuel. Sure when it ignites it'll burn all the oxygen and release that energy, but it is quickly absorbed by the rest of the fuel without any oxygen to act as a catalyst to result in combustion.
That was a check on state power, not federal.

Well:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk \n\nIt would appear that this is a county in England, and this page: http://www.withamgroup.co.uk/qualube/motorsport/ lead me to believe that Motul through Witham is most likely sponsoring this car in amateur rallycross, or simple rally, as the cars livery and general color scheme seems to match those shown in the pictures on their motorsport section of their website.\n\nPlus, it is very functional, and the color choice, while brash as a commuter car, accentuates the sporting nature of the overall vehicle. \n\n\nAlso, those that question the need for a spoiler on the rear of a FWD car don't understand the true purpose of aero on a car. The point is to assist the rear wheels with maintaining traction through maneuvers. This need is more apparent in RWD vehicles, but is important on any vehicle that is capable of inducing oversteer while in a turn, whether it be overloading the tires with power and traction, or through low contact pressure and a low traction surface. Rally benefits from FWD because weight is placed on driven wheels which do not suffer from oversteer by being at the front of the vehicle, but the rear wheels still need to be able to grip the road surface to ensure that simply overloading the tires through turning too hard for the amount of traction each tire has, which a spoiler, by adding weight as speed increases, does through sheer downward force.
Well it could be argued that his war, and the innovation in technology and increase in research infrastructure across the world, may ultimately save more lives than it has killed, by bringing this technology decades ahead.\n\nI mean, the innovation in nuclear science resulted in the birth of nuclear power as an energy source, and arguably those plants that would have otherwise been multiple coal plants built have reduced pollution in a manner that would've delayed climate change until we had a better understanding of environmental science to where we'll be able to mitigate it better.\n\n\nNote: I don't believe that doing such actions(taking lives to prevent future tragedy) is morally justified in any way, as it violates my individualist belief that one should not be expected to sacrifice for another person without their consent.

You make a fail safe bear trap. It can only be activated by the remote as the pressure is applied, not waiting to be released, instead using hydraulic or electric motors. That way if your remote fails the ability for the trap to remain an active threat is gone and thus it isn't a trap, but rather a stationary melee drone.

Even in the Southern European countries such as Italy and Spain which I have had the fortune of living in, it seems most people follow it from tradition rather than some devout desire to.\n\nThe UN report describing population replenishment due to underpopulation (though I thought overpopulation was the problem), seems more likely. Basically, it seems easier to control a population already under the fist of another tyrannical force (Islam), so why not minimise the population of "rebels" and introduce easier to work with slaves? 
Journey to the West by Wu Cheng en. It was bloody long, so developed patience reading it, was about a group of adventurers, so gained the desire to become independent and have my own adventures. It is just so epic and beautiful that it inspired the young me.
There's no global awakening. Just bad moves made by our establishments . People are still ignorant about 9 11 yet you think there's a wake up?
This is just a blatant sub-attack on Reddit to coincide nicely with the Milo scandal spat out by the MSM.\n\nFrankly, his words were twisted and regurgitated by the MSM to discredit him, the threat that he posed as a potential bridge between liberals and alt-righters.\n\nThere was no fucking way that the masters of our planet would let that bridge be built. His image will be soiled and we will lose another opportunity to actually listen to each other. Divide and conquer. \n\nGood luck all.
How can such a man say such things? Rogan is disgusting.\n\nMilo, however, just compared taking semen in the ass with homosexuality, which a part of it can be depending on your gender and if you fuck bareback, for example. \n\nRogan sounds like the creep here. \n\nThe propoganda in this forum is mind blowing today. They REALLY want to take Milo down. Just think for a moment. Pizzagate hardly gets a mention, but this Milo shit? \n\nHe could've been a great bridge between the left vs right masses.
Was really stupid to cut his feed. They just drew attention to what he said. Perhaps deliberately to confuse us? Or they are just fucking stupid.
Time to activate the iDrones who buy their shit and fight for their freedom to selfie!
There's no conspiracy here except something said really stupidly. It's obvious she's reflecting what was said about other races centuries ago out of spite and anger.\n\nYes, she's stupid, but this doesn't belong here. It belongs in /uncensorednews. \n\nHere is where you come to be enlightened, not angered by something so petty and dumb.
It does have a basement. Do your research better. You'd find an article where Ale.fantis specifically refers to his basement in that parlour.
Zoom in on the face. It looks like a photo composite of separate face parts. Do these people even fucking exist ?
It would be a suicidal diversionary tactic and they cannot be that stupid.
Just always be skeptical of everything and never believe anything without firm evidence. Make sure you're sure before commiting to anything. Peace
That's pretty sad.
At least it's slightly cute that way.
Thanks... I'm from the UK too though thankfully not living there. It is interesting how they do use these childish techniques and and they do work.\n\nMaybe my comment was misconstrued. I'm not saying that only a child would vote for Trump. But rather the way in which they speak to the audience affects many on an emotional level. When they're presented with this rather childish display of hate, name calling and insults, many reflect these attributes in themselves as some theorise it stimulates the memories of your youth and the usually dormant childish behaviour we all have. Not an insult for Trump voters, but apart from his claim to drain the swamp, what else did he have going for him?
Just YouTube pyramids and Tesla 
Just avoid anything that looks too good to be true, or that with an obvious bias both left or right, and you'll be fine. Surely others who share your concern would do the same, hence you'd avoid the trash and exchange ideas in articles with other people who can sift through the trash. Otherwise you're just arguing with those who wish to confirm their own beliefs rather than challenge them. And they're obvious to spot.
It seems so alien for somebody to even think of writing such a thing. Like it's almost unreal. It's like hearing the last sentence of a conversation and you're certain somebody is about to sodomise a kitten, but you realise they were talking about Dick the doll and Uranus the planet. Can a person be so sick? Or was he just stressed because children are fucking annoying as hell, especially on planes? What does wired usually mean anyway?
Please stop posting here Mr. President. We will never stop being suspicious of you.
Perhaps there is a conspiracy that Trump is his lover. But Milo could do better.
Wow that's a lot of removed comments. Can only imagine the truths they told.
I have seen it too. It just strikes me as odd that they wouldn't just stick to a missile. What purpose could it have possibly had? A soul taker?
Well he is walking proof that the elites are not using children corpses to harvest organs/drink blood/conduct Satanic rituals to retain their youth, because he is UAF.
He is probably involved himself just by the overwhelming circumstancial evidence such as his connections and the whole context of the scenario. He ain't gonna be president without some dark shit hanging over his head. There are probably videos of him with corpses somewhere.
Oh yes, of course. I hadn't even considered the financial issues. They now probably own all of Kanyes assets too. Wasn't his wife robbed a while back? Could be related.
Just watch September Clues on YouTube. They analyse in depth the original live footage provided by the news companies themselves, and also the "amateur videos" of that day. The cymbals are mentioned somewhere near the middle in the sound section, but it's best to watch it all.
Does this mean I can't drink alcohol? This make my more stupider?
You mean, the reality that he favours Sachs in some way? That he is just a tool and in reality people felt compelled to vote for Trump as the media basically established him as anti establishment in an utterly anti establishment environment?\n\nWhich reality are you referring to?
Voat became a huge traffic area when Liz z a Mate got shut down in Reddit. It was so exciting, like something explosive was gonna happen, but then nothing ever DID.\n\nNot surprising something went on over at voat at that time. Perhaps installation of IP capture programming to locate contributors to kizzafate
Just like they did by mixing cymbal sounds in with the impact of the planes hitting the WTC, they are mocking us.\n\nPamela Anderson was famously known for being a lifeguard. That is what anybody would immediately think, of Baywatch and her running in slow motion in a skimpy bikini with her ... Ahem... bouncing hypnotically (for those who are into that kind of thing). A lifeguard running to save Assange, only, just like everything else, it is not real. She ain't no lifeguard.
Not sure Russia would be so stupid as to kill two different people secretly using the same method (virtually). If they did it the first time, they made a big mistake, as other governments can just cause the same death effect on a prominent Russian citizen and all eyes will be looking at the large, drunken bear.
Is this fair? How is it not different from censorship ? And who is going to use it without being compelled to do so? \n\nJust seems like a cheap way of complying with your puppet masters. No one will really give a damn if you just completely shut down the subreddits that are threatening your credibility anyway, I mean they accepted u/spez making Reddit completely liable for all comments on reddit when he modified a few posts a couple months back. What's stopping you now?
Perhaps this is genuine disinformation , crafted by Killary herself, putting out the idea on the fringes of the internet that Trump has liver cancer, so when she OFFS ThE bastRAd for STealINg my CrowN!!!!!!! Conspiracy theorists can say I told you so and not even bother to investigate the details of his death. \n\nBut she forgets how curious we cats are... Meooowoowowowoww
Though I'm not convinced by astral projection yet, it really does seem that we can do something vibrational with our bodies in a meditative state. Have no idea what it is, but it feels nice, is there a scientific explanation for it? 
She's known as a sexy lifeguard in a fictitious TV series. She's only there to keep up the pretense that Assange is well inside the embassy, when in fact she and those who put her there are all out there laughing at us. It's like an inside joke,...
Seriously? This is the best the MSM could do? Attacks on his moral standings didn't work, so resort to petty playground insults and insinuations? All the evidence points to him being able to read (Twitter, expensive education, possible paranoid news binges as we all have from time to time). This is just pathetic. Just catch him masturbating with a cross and you're good to go.
This is why there are wars and conflict over that region. The US wants in on this ancient shit and wants it NOW. Though can you blame them? What if some technologically bloody marvelous ancient weapon resurfaced in Iran? Not sure they'd be so hesitant to use it.
If you're implying that the US would try and get its grubby fingers on Venezuela it's hard to see how they could possibly play it out justifiable to the public. Need some kind of big, UFO shaped justification.
How the fuck does this get so many upvotes? Seems like the bots are trying to make this subreddit another "alt right" fake news source.
Our origins really just could be a tripped out monkey developing the conscious ability to mentally envision unreal things (thoughts), and apply it to the passing of time and necessity.\n\nOr we could be manufactured literal slaves by lizards native to our planet or another. \n\nEither way it's interesting.
Now, now, there's no need to sling words about like homophobe. Wouldn't be so surprising if Obama was gay. He was chosen for being charismatic and for being a good talker, just a puppet. He was set up with a beautiful wife and kids to play the charade. Just watch the video of Michelle Obama accidentally saying she's a single mother. \n\nWhy do people focus on the Presidents anyway? They are fucking PUPPETS. Who gives a shit about them? 
Just check out both sides of the coin. They're really no different in their atrocities.
If this is a video from Anonymous then they must be infiltrated and hosting crazy theories to discredit the entire thing.\n\nNot that I disagree completely with the theories, but sheeple associate this with crazy conspiracies and are more likely to be turned off to investigating other things such as pizzagate etc
People too lazy for civil war. They tried with women's rallies and paid protestors to convince us that people cared, but that probably just kept more people at home as somebody was doing it anyway.\n\nThere will be no civil war. They just want to eliminate foreign nuclear threats, control foreign countries, round us all up when there is nowhere left to run, no more nukes to threaten them,  and kill us all. Why create such an expensive war? The only reason I could think of is to make money out of mass murder, televise it, make it some kind of sick reality show. Anything is possible. But they would force this war upon us.
Please don't use "Soros" and "fingered" in the same sentence again.
Some days I find myself inclining to the doctrine of the psychopaths in control of the US. The philosophy that a majority of us are just savage animals in cloths, knowingly destroying our planet and ourselves by refusing to accept reality, refusing to think. \n\nSupposedly they justify this with Darwin's "survival of the fittest". If the masses continue to not care about the consequences of their actions, and I mean driving cars, buying plastics and other useless rubbish from factories that spurn out pollution etc, including such seemingly simple things such as water and electricity usage, they threaten the survival of the elites, who perhaps do believe that they are intelligent, but are also just coked out rich savage animals in clothes. We buy instead of knit, consume instead of create, indulge in our desires instead of our needs to truly survive without any of the things we use in our daily lives. So it is not hard to see why the elites hate us, as we are tacky, poor animals aiding in the destruction of our habitats. \n\nThough the elites really are worse in every way, don't get me wrong.\n\nLies are spread about free energy and high technology that they hide to keep us miserable and poor, but they are just that. Lies to give the skeptics in us some hope that maybe it will turn out good.\n\nBut then other days I think that we could live, all 7 billion and more, in harmony, if education and health were better. I'm convinced that people can live in peace together but we have suffered for thousands of years under the control of religion/bad governments. \n\nIf you want something less profound, the only reasonable way of life seems to be some sort of capitalism, where education/health/creativity are the most highly esteemed values, as are the rights of the individual to do as he or she pleases as long as they don't force another to stop doing what he pleases. \n\nThis opinion is subject to change. 
Because a person who has their country's culture deeply embedded in them enough (shared cultural values/relations/similar opinions/views, shared race (to some extent)),  are less likely to shoot a fellow citizen of their country dead on order.
These are obviously all disturbed people, working independently in their craziness. Terrorist groups on the other hand...\n\nJust seems like an article to inflame tensions, ignore it or respond to it, do as you feel best.
That's not true, we can suppress our urge to rip out the eyes of an old lady blocking our way onn the pavement with rational thought that it's immoral and wrong. A stupid psychopath is much worse.
I don't believe this for a second. Milo is being silenced because he is an anomaly gaining traction, a potentially dangerous one. He is a gay guy calling out "liberals" for their hypocritical actions, and could inspire a lot of people to see behind the curtain, not to mention the potential of uniting people *gasp*.
You have no idea what lens flare is, do you? It's not even a fleet of UFOs, it's one "UFO" that uses orbs that fly around it to create complex geometric shapes to easily conduct dark energy and move/warp. Wouldn't be surprised if it was just a government ship. Why would aliens bother to visit the shithole that is Earth, full of shit ignorant people?
I don't mean to say he is innocent, but rather he was given up to the public along with Clinton as a kind of sacrifice.
That last line is just so striking to me as cocaine. Living with several people who have offered me lines, this seems to me as something that very person would say. Not trying to discredit pizzagate or anything, this is just one instance where it could be something different. 
There are loads of old people that look way better than these junkies. If there was some secret for immortality you'd think they'd use it to make themselves look younger rather than psychotic monsters. And don't say they can change their energy frequency .
The torture finally got to him.
Don't forget that toothpaste contains fluoride! Happy brushing!
Could you elaborate a moment on one premise, that the election was a failure of the global cabal? Is this why they will be holding a cosmic false flag?\n\nIf Clinton had won, then this would not occur?
Amazing the mental loopholes people will use to avoid the shame of accepting the Trump lie. They've certainly been well and truly Tr*mped.
Yeah, that probably came off as a bit crazy. But your intention was very sweet. 
They are threatening YOU. She or whoever writes for her KNEW you would be all over it and post it in a place like this, to flaunt how they are getting away with it and threaten you with what goes around comes around. If you delve too deep into pizzagate and start downloading stuff from WikiLeaks etc so easily, it might be dangerous. Be fucking careful. Do you want to make Killary happy????\n\nAs in plural you , those who like conspiracies like myself
Our origins.
I think it's been popularised in a video game or cartoon as, at least here in Southern Europe, "illuminati" is really popular all of a sudden with youngsters. \n\nThe Illuminati is really old, it probably has morphed into something completely different now that is incompatible with the old model anyway. 
So it's OK to say that fat ugly smelly person sitting over there? Where do you draw a line to what is OK and what's not? When is it OK to label somebody with something they're not comfortable with? It's can't be OK for one thing and not OK for another. 
It's just shitty, "edgey" "modern" performance. Satan isn't real. Can't believe people still believe that. It's just a great cover to make you look like a wacko when you post things like this. \n\nOh and governments like wasting tax money because, you guessed it, the majority are useless, incompetent, and just as stupid as the average person, just with money and influence.
Seriously? Satanic Rituals don't play out like this. This is just pretentious shite. If people can't understand it they are going to assume it's something profound, but it's just crappy choreography.
Please at least watch the footage again and pay attention to all of the collapses. It's hard to argue with someone who claims the sky is green. Objectively they shouldn't have fallen at all, and even the newsreaders that day were confused.
OK, that sounds pretty bad. Do you really want the daughter of a man like this running your country, France? Really? Fuck the governments, who made these people seem like the only same choice in an insane world. They WANT to lead us down this path of division and hate, backed up by one hell of a control system that will finally lead to eternal sclavitude. 
Oh, God, please don't let "truf" catch on. 
You're absolutely right.\nPeople don't care about anything unless it affects them, as much as they would like to believe that they are outraged enough to spur action.\n\nBut truly , how many people here who would disagree with you, would be willing to right now partake in the "get rid of them"? And raising awareness doesn't count, as deep down you know from experience that it don't matter how many people know, it just matters who did it. 
Conspiracy please or gtfo.
Your observation is absolutely correct. I hope we don't succumb to it. This subreddit is certainly under close scrutiny by the governments for the nature of its subjects and potential reach (Reddit). Can we avoid this calamity? Just point it out wherever you can and keep reminding people to love thy fellow Reddit user and cast the shills down to one of the seven hells.
We would know because people like you would post intentionally false claims to undermine credibility in our subreddit. Good try, though.
The truth has already come out and nothing happened. In Europe after 9/11, just days later, there were reports and videos showing all the discrepancies and confusions of the attack from the footage seen that day. There was no need to state the plain truth for even a photo says a thousand words. 16 years have passed. Has justice prevailed?\n\nIf we are not complete slaves in another 16 years, or dead or whatever, will we continue to look back on Pizzagate and wonder when people will start caring?
This is the best conspiracy of them all in my eyes: our origins. The others are usually just about crimes and other horrible things. They capture us through their ability to enrage us and demand justice.\n\nBut here we are seeking to understand the beauty displayed within these cultures, and to learn more about ourselves. It would be the most inhumane thing to deny us this right.\n\nI've read somewhere that the origin ancient culture separated around the globe and constructed these huge pyramids to harness/boost/communicate with etc.. the life force or energy of our planet, which is supposedly a conscious, living being. This is mixed in with Atlantis and other crazy stuff, but perhaps there are some half truths there.\n\nHad these cultures shared the same land mass before and shared customs/traditions/knowledge? Did they, using their knowledge, deliberately set out to far away, specific points on the globe to produce such beauty as to benefit the "soul" of a planet? If we are the children of the planet, our mother Earth would certainly want us to flourish for both our benefit.\n\nThere is much to be skeptical on, but at least there's beauty to see when investigating. Hillary Clinton / Podesta / Trump et al are just ugly.
Automation will render the whole point moot when humans become too costly to keep servicing. Not sure who they are going to sell to, though. Interplanetary traders?
His tweet proves it is not him writing.\n\nHe would never criticise the very people who frequent WikiLeaks and disperse the information efficiently by claiming they exaggerate. \n\nHe would never label their theories as "curious plots". \n\nThis certifies his death or his breaking under torture. Although if he was dead they wouldn't have gotten authenticity.
Just the fact that they all fell should have been enough to tell us that something wasn't right. Nothing is going to happen about this. 
Even if we don't protest, they can stage protests and use it to justify our slaughter. 
Wouldn't it just look like Putin got down on his knees for the USA and gave Trump a blowjob in the White House? Can't see them getting over that hurdle of pride yet.
Hipster is just another manufactured term to give those who feel a little self conscious with their image a way to project their own negative feelings onto somebody to make themselves feel better.\n\nThe concept was invented through this word, which is actually completely subjective, that is, the meaning and identification of a hipster can change from person to person. For me, it's somebody who wears fake glasses, has a selfie stick , and an Instagram account. But surely there are others who feel differently.\n\nAs a negative term it should be avoided: these "offensive" words are basically crowbars to widen gaps in social cohesion. They can be turned around and used to even strengthen minority identification, which is not really good in my eyes. We should recognise that we are all individuals, not groups. Groups don't even fucking exist, we are all shades in-between. \n\nOnce we realise that on a global level, if we ever can, then can we live free and happy.
You're right, universal basic income is probably the worst of the worst, and even fucking worse is that the average person views it as a good idea . Jokes that they would stop working. \n\nWe would become slaves.\n\nBut don't let that worry you. Just live life the most you can now before you're either dead or a slave. You at least have now to do something. If you wallow in depression you've just let your "enemy" win. Learn to paint/draw/sketch/play piano/violin/guitar etc, learn foreign languages, do whatever you can to extend your own knowledge before you can't .
I suppose it could make sense. There was no other animal that could really smoke a blunt for example (I.e. develop tools to ignite leaves to smoke habitually/ritually), and I have no idea if other animals eat mushrooms or not as a lot are poisonous. It would certainly help me justify my penchant for psychedelics.
Don't forget these people are psychotic, controlled, blackmailed into their jobs. They do not partake in family bead making. These are obviously some way of communicating something, or perhaps to gain entry somewhere. The idea that their kids, who probably have lots of PlayStations cars etc, with dickheads for parents, would bother "putting something together like a peasant girl" when they are used to luxury jewelry, is absurd.\n\nAnd it's a fucking slice of pizza.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't be surprised if they were forced to wear them to remind them everyday what they are and keep them 100 percent obedient. Always.
It absolutely is. No pie should dare be soiled with pepperoni. Cherry pie....
Maybe he will get a bunch of Mexican Muslim Gay Lesbians who have had Abortions and are gay married to BLM members, ordained by Killary, to destroy the Statue of Liberty with a truck laden with explosives and draped in the Confederate flag, all planned by Podesta who was sellotaped nude to the roof of the truck, which incidentally was a pizza truck .\n\nOh, and it will happen during the night on 2/22 just because the numbers look like 666 upside down, kinda like how 911 seen in a mirror looks like "lie" if you factor in the gash on the first tower left by the plane.
This will be for people who just want to see cat gifs. As an attempt to censor us it's pretty useless, so don't be surprised if this is a distraction for something deeper going on. I'm sure Trump mentioned something about fixing the internet, and he wouldn't have said that without being debriefed by his master's first, and simply translated it "fixing the internet" so the masses could understand.\n\nBe scared when they just block the address from your countries IP, and block every possible proxy, then just shut the damn internet mathingy thing off. How will you coordinate then? People should all learn sign language in the US for when it's them against the others. It provides benefits that Reddit just cannot in the heat of battle.
Wow, completely missed the sarcasm. ...Isn't /s legally required yet?
I agree.\n\nThe question should not be why haven't they visited us, but rather "why leave their host planet"?\n\nAs sapient creatures we have developed the ability to connect ourselves consciously to our universe and be amongst others with whom we share the universe.\n\n We may never meet in our physical bodies, due to vast differences in distance which throw drastic difficulties such as time dilation into the equation. But then again our bodies were made for this planet alone , and we get sick when we are off the planet, pretty badly too.\n\nAny advanced culture is simply that which has realised that the physical (UFOs) mean nothing to the extraterrestrial travelers, and that by achieving synchronicity with their universal frequency or whatever through deep meditation/yoga/chakra work or whatever you want to call it, one can achieve connectedness with the one and explore aspects of the universe that your Own. Individual. Mind (independent on whether you are human or alien) is ready for at that particular time and space. \n\nThat's why aliens haven't visited us. UFOs could be all government test planes. Roswell could have been. Complete False Flag to make every following UFO a crazy sighting of a conspiracist. Human abductees real people, but simply a shock vibration test performed on the public to see how the average person would react to a UFO false flag.\n\nThe US government could know this (aliens aren't coming and we are going nowhere) and have been driven mad by the thought that technology was useless for their own salvation, advanced alien technology was not going to fall into their hands, that they were physically alone in the universe, they would see NOTHING new apart from the cultures they had grown to resent and detest on this planet, the very same planet that they had to share with US (pronoun we, not USA), the masses. Perhaps they are too fucked by karma by murder/drugs/genocide/pizza etc, to connect to the universe, and they NEED us to feel guilt (*cough* religion*cough*), to stop us from connecting to it out of pure, evil, disgusting spite.\n\nDon't believe anything. Just breath deep. Close your eyes. Sit in a dark room. Count to 50 on each deep breath, keep every single thought out and say "thank you" to yourself when you realise you are thinking , and see how you feel from there. \n\n
I agree with that you're saying and the perspective you are coming from. Houston *does* have a diverse hiphop audience. People of all races and ages have a pride for the famous southern rap scene we used to have. I've met enough people in the service industry to know that there is a very strong racial stereotype about black people with regards to things like tipping. It's hard for me to see her comments as not being racist, but I am willing to accept that possibility.\n\n>you can't demonstrate contempt for your customers and expect to keep the doors open\n\nAgree 100%
This just shows how foolish we were to allow burqas  or whatever that garment is called to be banned in many Western countries. They try to justify a reason for not covering ones face (terrorists) and slowly widen the law to extend to others. It would never have been approved at face value (banning covering your face in public), so they created a justifiable reason.\n\nIt shows how foolish we can be to erode the freedom of any individual, whatever "minority" label they may have burdened upon them. It reminds me of that saying, Nobody did anything when they came for C, or B, who saved A? Or something to that extent.
It's not gonna explode. It's these types of posts that subliminally demoralise people to investigate because they believe it's nearly wrapped up.
Treat your audience like a child and they'll react like a child, and vote Trump. 
Mark Jones. I love tech house, and this guy is pretty good. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/hulk1516/videos
gerrymandering is really bad, evil even, but it won't stop the Cruzes, the Cornyns, the Patricks, or the Abbots. 
Get to the
Has anyone told them to lower their prices and easily take credit cards?
I like it. 
Have you been to the woodlands? They got out, I don't blame them for not wanting to come back. 
They don't have an argument. Women aren't baby factories and adults are worth more than fetuses. There is no shame in having an abortion and women shouldn't have to come up with any reason at all to justify their want for one any more than I should need to justify why I want to remove a growth from my nutsack. \n\nEDIT: The mistake being made is pro-choice people trying to adjust the conversation away from convenience abortions. Of course it's important for rape victims and victims of incest to be able to abort, or to be able to abort horribly deformed fetuses. That shouldn't be the only "moral" abortions. Every abortion should be spoken of as a moral abortion. Millions of women have abortions simply because they weren't ready for kids, and this is a good thing. There is no shame in this. Refusing to talk about it when talking about abortion rights does nobody any good. It gives ground to anti-choice wackos. They will come protest abortion clinics and harass women. Pro-choice advocates shouldn't be afraid to speak up and defend ALL women (and the men that support their decision) that choose to have an abortion no matter what the reason. 
Yeah well... fuck those guys. 
Wait... what do other people call them?
Culberson. It's not the City's fault. It's that asshole in Washington that took it personally that we wanted rail. 
Except the rent on the nutshell is way too high and all the culture was forced to move elsewhere. 
Lol. There was no Reagan after he left office. There wasn't a Reagan by the end of his last term.
Praia Urbana is great whenever they do it at LCC. Look out for Cirque Noir events also if you like deep house. 
I miss it already. Salt grass is too expensive and has no bloomin onion. 
This is the 2nd time I've heard about this. Knowing that place, drugs were definitely involved, so it's more understandable. 
She only took over the venue recently. Maybe a 70 year old might not be the best option to run a cool venue that book acts young people want to see. Fitz is done if they can't get millennials in the door.   
Night Drive is local? 
I'm curious. What is a good response when *some* feminists (not all, of course) make the claim of "what about the mens" when trying to discuss genuine men's issues such as prison rape and suicide, or even the vastly higher incarceration rate for the same crimes?
is it at least online?
Milo shills for a political ideology shared by people that wants to exterminate people like him. You have apparently never had an alt-right nutcase write up a manifesto as a reply to you about how gays are all pedophiles and genetically defective and should be taken out of the gene pool.\n\nEDIT: If I find it, I'll post it
A lot of the camping has shower access, FYI
And there isn't a law that says you have to do it. The average person doesn't have a fuck ton of LLCs and shell corps to choose where and how to carry a loss. He lost 900million on a bad deal done through one of his businesses. He chose to report that loss, that year, on his personal taxes, although it wasn't a loss he was personally on the hook for. 
I swang and I swang and I swang to the left. 
That is awesome. I mean it sucks, but I am really warming up to this. It makes it a 150 dollar "ticket" that won't go on your record. Pot really is decriminalized in Houston. 
>In the end, if the market didn't demand these prices and these structures then they wouldn't exist.\n\nThat doesn't make it right. And yes, developers and investors. That nice low cost apartment complex torn down to build another "luxury" complex isn't being done by the residents and for the residents. That shitty renovation in 2nd ward being sold for 750k is not being done by a resident. It's an investor that bought a house in a neighborhood they never intended to live in. Hell, there is a good chance they don't live in Houston, or even the USA. \n\n>How else do you suppose someone build equity?\n\nWhy should they? Someone buys a house and a lot, they own own a house and a lot after 30 years. They should be glad if they can break even, but everyone expects a profit. I take better care of my car than some people do on their houses, but I have to sell my car for a loss. Expecting first and only houses to be investments is a bad idea and it hasn't helped our country. It has caused the cost of housing to spike and it has allowed investors to come in and make a ton of money and shut others out. It has increased income inequality. Lots of things caused the housing bubble, but this was a major factor. \n\nIt's time more people accepted that capitalism is not sustainable. 
If you're lucky, they will do another Houston Open Air. 
Yeah, but I think it's more than that. Like, depression is much more than low serotonin, ADHD is much more than low dopamine. Adderall definitely feels really effing good, but it doesn't cure my ADHD. It takes effort to focus on a task. I've noticed that drugs like Adderall help do that by giving me more energy to push through, but the effort is the same whether I take anything or not. I'm normally unmedicated, and with effort, I can focus and get things done, but it takes a lot of energy I don't always have.
Silo gets shut down? When that happen?\n\nAnyway, yeah shows are still happening, but they're not like the bangers from back in the day. I'm into house, techno, and UK dubstep mostly, and there is still a small but dedicated scene for that stuff that uses whatever club or odd venue available. Some events are semi-regular, some are one-off. Sometimes it's club hours, sometimes they go well into the next day. I've seen other cool events also like the one linked at the top that bring talent from other neglected genres.\n\nI mean, I would love a good and proper rave. I haven't been to one of those in more than 15 years. Festivals are cool, but the heat of the daytime, the sometimes corporate vibe, and ending at 11pm sucks. I don't think we will see one inside Houston proper. There is a critical mass of attention that will bring out all the opposition from the residents and the city. We are lucky to have something like Day 4 Night happen and go off as well as it did. That wasn't a rave, but it had the vibe at times and I was worried it would be ruined by something.
I agree, but it's not exactly fair to people that moved into a neighborhood that was not in a flood plain, only to have their neighborhood made a flood plain by politics. Brays need widening, and they are working on it, but it is not being widened nearly enough. \n\nTBH, the neighborhood does have some responsibility. NIMBY fucks in that area have been against widening and have shut down attempts at it for 30 years. \n\nLuckily, people are now building with raised foundations. 
Milo is an uncle tom
I wasn't too into the punk scene, but saw a few shows there. The 30footfall show was probably the best out of the lot. I had a lot of fun. Just watch the hole in the floor and holy shit was it loud.

Don't be obtuse. We all know exactly what she was inferring. That's the problem with stereotypes. 
There will always be a 100 year storm or 1000 year storm. Little can prevent flooding under a tropical storm Allison. This isn't about that. Right now, even a normal rain band causes flooding. Houses in Meyerland have flooded 3 times in 2 years. The bayou system has not been improved at the same rate as all the new development that depends on it. That's a fact (jack).\n\nAll these new suburbs have been allowed to use the bayou system pretty much for free. They should have been required to offset their dependence on that system in some way, either by paying for it, or coming up with some other way to drain that runoff.  
Well there you go.\n\n>such as food stamps and medicaid.\n\nLet's dispel the notion that our state leadership doesn't know what it's doing, it knows exactly what it's doing. \n\nTexas certainly doesn't want to help poor folks, so the burden is on the federal government. To be honest, our state leadership probably don't consider this as counting against them. They, and the people that voted for them probably see this as a wonderful thing for the state, and a black mark for the federal government. 
It's not possible at some places. The secret group is a small venue. The place itself is very nice, but they don't own the street.
They started selling a smaller serving of onion petals. It was maybe half as much. 
Hell yes. I saw them there once.
This has nothing to do with feminism. In her original rant, she complained that black people don't tip and all they want to do is smoke weed. Unfortunately, tipping culture does vary by race. If she is worried about tipping, the real question should be why the fuck she doesn't pay her bartenders enough? As far as weed, well it's pretty harmless. Nobody is getting high and starting shit. They just want to see a show. She is a racist that doesn't feel comfortable with black culture being associated with her venue. She should be made aware that hiphop is the new punk rock. 
We haven't seen 2017 D4N yet ;)
That is an insightful comment. 
Some people forget that the civil rights movement in the 60s, or the labor movement in the 30s, would have never worked if they stuck to purely peaceful protest. The nation was a powder keg at that time. It's important for our leaders to fear what might happen if they don't do what is right. That is something they haven't had to worry about in a long time. 
Without free speech zones and jack booted police keeping protesters off the streets, they might accidently catch a glimpse, or worse, the elected leaders might. 
Stereo live is way too crowded and it closes early. It's awesome, but just so popular and because of that, it must follow all the rules. 
Damn. I go to shows there sometimes and park on the street. I feel like I'm taking a risk every time. I get why crime happens and I'm not blaming the venue. Sometimes I wish the law said we could be strapped when we go to bars, though. 
Trump had a 900 mil. loss in business. Somehow gets to claim this on personal taxes and so carry over that loss year after year and avoid paying taxes for a very long time. That's not OK. 
My assumption is that it's only a certain area of the brain that would be the problem. I have ADHD, and during moments of clarity and focus, I can be pretty smart, other times, it's hard to follow simple things. I suspect it's some part of the brain involved in regulating the flow of information. Making the entire brain "grow" would be a bad idea. The size of the brain is not what equals intelligence. A Dolphin's brain is larger than ours. They're smart, but not as smart as us. 
lol, if you're not being sarcastic, the police are employed to protect the state and the rich. ACAB. Even the "good ones" willingly enforce laws designed to fuck us. People forget that the supreme court ruled that a cop's duty is NOT to protect us. Protecting us and not the state is about the only thing that can get a cop fired.
That's actually a good point.
We end the war on drugs, stop stigmatizing recreational drug use, and we prioritize treatment and mental health care.\n\nAlso, we need to accept that drug use is often a symptom of something much greater, such as the coping with the lack of opportunity or the lack of meaning in our lives under capitalism. \n\nMen often don't feel like they have a place in this modern world, and with little access to opportunity, drugs are a great way to escape that.
Ehh... Also male here, and plenty of women have them because they just don't want kids and their BC failed or whatever. They aren't emotionally wrecked by it and they might have another one if it happens again. This is OK. This shouldn't be shamed. The more that people expect all women to be emotionally wrecked by an abortion, the more women will feel like there is something wrong with them when they aren't. Abortions should be free, and they should be easily accessible. \n\nHaving children in this country is so fucked up. It shouldn't be a struggle to have kids and it shouldn't be a struggle if you don't want kids ever, or if you don't want kids right now.  
Flooding is an issue we have to deal with, but it is the fault of development towards the west on the edge of, and outside of Houston. In the past, rain would drain into the ground. Now it hits a street that wasn't there before, drains into a gutter, and into a bayou. Houston was designed to use the bayou system for drainage. All that new development also uses it, but doesn't do much for Houston in return. That needs to change. \n\nCrime is comparatively low for a major city. It is also a socioeconomic issue. Crime goes down as opportunity goes up. Texas, in general, isn't a good place for people trapped in poverty. Change that, and people don't need to steal to get by. Same with the homeless. We have a pretty good system for helping them when compared to other Texas cities, but it is not as good as it could be. Some homeless don't want to jump through all the hoops it takes to get that help. A universal basic income, if done right, could eliminate a large amount of crime and homelessness in the USA practically overnight. 
We are the same age and same situation minus one. My current GF did not bristle at finding out I've experimented with men in the past. It was a huge relief, so I get it. I haven't messed around with a dude in forever, and since I'm mostly attracted to women, it hasn't really bothered me, but, it sure is nice not to have to hide it. That means not having to worry about any of the bullshit that goes with homophobia. I can think drag queens are awesome. I can care about how I look when we go out. I can respect a man's physique. I can love house music. I can be unmarried, 35, no kids. I can hang out at the artsy part of town. I can stimulate the ol prostate. I never have to say "no homo". \n\nSociety is just warming up to how badly bisexual people are treated at a time when some people are wanting to end the idea of binary genders entirely. So, bisexual people are going through erasure, and then will face more erasure. \n\nIn the meantime, a good judge of character is how people treat LGBT folks. Good people won't look down on you for being bisexual. even a little bit bisexual. \n\nOh, and take it from experience: You can go to gay clubs. Just be prepared to be hit on constantly if people get a whiff you might be more straight than gay. Attractive women complain about men competing for their affection. I kind of get it. 
Trump only hates the intelligence community when they dig up dirt on him. Trump will make the police, FBI, CIA, NSA, and armed forces more powerful in the next 4 years, fact. 
That's a fair point. Stereo live is the largest EDM club in Texas. We are lucky to have it. I'm seeing Digweed there this Friday :) Been wanting to see him since I was younger.  
Don't forget capitalism doing a great job of raising the price. Like, drugs should be cheaper today than ever before.
Communist memes are only okay if everybody *gets* them
Liberals are not socialists. Liberals like Obama, Clinton, Pelosi, they all are hyper-capitalists that support big business, wall St.\n\nThink about the most liberal bastion of the USA, silicon valley. It is also the most obsessed with capitalism. \n\nBernie Sanders wasn't even a socialist, although he supported some socialist policies like national healthcare. 
The point I wanted to make was not glorifying it, but that it does seem to be working. It is throwing them off, disrupting their gatherings, and forcing a lot of people on the right to come out in public support of literal nazis. I also wanted to give some vocal support to a group that seems to be taking an anonymous risk for our benefit.
:P I knew that much. Basically, I went to go check out T_D for lulz, and good lord do they hate Antifa for shutting down their shit every time they try to gather at university. They were so angry that someone punched that one nazi guy that they were willing to pay a ton of money as a bounty to find out who the guy was that threw the punch. I thought it was great. I mean, these people were literally defending a nazi. There is no more clear proof of what kind of scum is behind the alt-right.
Gentrification is bad. There is a huge difference between making an area vibrant, clean, safe, and gentrification. An area doesn't need to cost a fortune to be vibrant clean and safe.\n\nThe developers that buy up places like heights, midtown, Montrose, 2nd ward, and so forth and charge huge premiums for shitty renos should be ran out of town. Also, a house is not supposed to be an investment. You are not owed a profit on your house. A house should a place where you live and put down roots. Breaking even on a house should be the norm. This is part of what caused the housing bubble and it leads to gentrification because everyone expects property values to rise and so they do. Only wealthier people can afford it after they do. Repeat. A 2nd house somewhere might be an investment if you plan to rent it, but all these investors from elsewhere fucking up our neighborhoods need to GTFO. Developers are tearing down good lower cost apartments and building expensive places. Developers are choosing to charge a premium for things they don't need to charge a premium for simply because they can. I don't blame the people that move in for gentrification, I blame developers and investors.
I guess it depends on what you want. It is paradise to the people seeking expensive planned community with little diversity. It is hell to anyone else. 
>takes away from *real racism* when it does occur.\n\nI didn't realize I was speaking to the world's foremost expert on racism. \n\nHer rant was hostile, aggressive, and targeted stereotypical things associated with one race in particular. I'm not the only one that can see that for what it is. 
He shouldn't exempt from a god damn thing. 
lol. the police exist to protect the elite and to gather evidence against you for the state. They are the enemy as far as I am concerned. \n\nThe fact that you would round about defend that nazi scum in the link says all I need to know about you. 
"control free speech". I've heard this argument before. I used to believe it years ago. The more I read about anarchism, socialism, and the more I thought about the rights of people, the less and less this made any sense. Antifa are protecting the speech of the oppressed by fighting oppressors. Free speech is about more than just words. Someone more wise than myself said something like this: The spirit of free speech, is so that everyone has freedom of expression. That means everyone, including women, LGBT, racial minorities, handicapped, and everyone else can safely express themselves and be themselves without oppression. Do you understand? This cannot happen and will never happen under a fascist system of leadership.
I mean, yeah there is room back by that staircase that goes into the wall and some by the bar, but it's still a little bit annoying that it gets so many people deep like it's a music festival every Saturday night. It bothers me more that it's a short party. 10pm to 2am goes by super fast. I'm not doing mdma or anything, but even so, the place feels like it's designed to be open longer. 
I'm not resistant to change. I'm resistant to stupid. 
High five. I am not the biggest EDM fan (I like more tech house and uk dubstep), but I went all in with middlelands this year. I plan to have a blast. VIP tickets, preferred camping. I pray for no flooding and cops that aren't trying to bust up everyone's good time. Honestly, this last something wicked was perfect as far as all that went so hope for that same vibe or better. I wasn't the only older guy there so that was also nice. I've never been to a camping festival. I'm excited. 
>four-hour drug education class\n\nI knew there would be something stupid like this. I guess this is as good as we can get until Texas gets its head out of its ass, but I'd honestly rather it be more like a traffic citation until we get to legalization. I'm sure the 4 hour class will be both inconvenient and not free. Weed is safe and unless the class is about how not to get caught with it, what is the purpose?\n\nEDIT: I don't want to sound ungrateful. Kim Ogg is really doing a good thing here and I'm sure trying her best to make it palatable to the fundamentalists. 
> It's like a Communist state dream come true.\n\nWrong political system. It's fascism plain and simple. \n
Yeah, they were great at SW, but the EDM lovers will be at middlelands this year. Maybe that is why no huge EDM closer at FPSF.

Sportsmonkey. I've done a few seasons. It's always been fun. Some teams are really good (Alcoballics, I'm looking at you). We never were, but we had some cool jerseys and a case of beer, so that was nice. 
Lots of electronic music stuff going on if you like that kind of thing.
It gets way too crowded on weekends. I wish they had 18+ only hours as well. 
Not everyone gets more conservative as they get older.
If you edge for a really long time, it is likely to happen. When I'm fucking for hours, edging, getting close then taking a break, and going again, when I finally cum, it often ends up being 2 back to back. \n\nStill jealous of women. My girl will cum dozens of times, just over and over, and so 2 orgasms is nothing.

Cultivare in the heights. Make sure you order an Ava Crowder. Best drink ever. For classy night spots, try a piano bar. My dad does maggianos and a piano bar with his girls. I had better luck with cultivare and a dive bar.

I've lived and worked around conservatives all my life. I have a good job. I support the far left because from a human rights perspective, there is no other option. Capitalism has ruined the earth and has failed as a system that lifts people out of poverty.

If anything else stopped working 99% of the time or greater, wouldn't you say that thing was dying? Hell, Most people would correctly say that it's already dead. But no. Capitalism works great for 1% of the population, and so it's thriving says the liberals and the right wing. \n\nIt's dead, Jim. 
2015 had mastodon and the sword. Both were awesome. 
Not only non-existent problem, but they only focused on protecting women and girls, and as usual, didn't give a flying fuck about men and boys. Trans woman goes into woman's bathroom = horrible danger to girls, society. Trans man goes into men's bathroom? Crickets. The Texas taliban strikes again.
Watson got too close to the truth.
>she couldn't find a suitable tenant\n\nThat's for sure. I think some group had it for a short time and then trashed the place. \n\nBut yeah, I remember when I was in highschool. Lots of debauchery at Fitz. Plenty of trashy punk bands, and trashy punkers, plenty of weed smoking. I mean, that is why I don't see what leg she has to stand on when she complains about lyrics today. There were bands back then that were trying hard to be offensive. I liked it, the few times I went. I've gone there more recently and the vibe is totally different. It's not the same kind of place, that's for sure. It sucks, because it's a pretty good venue and could really bring in some fun shows if they did it right. They need to be more than just open to hiphop and to electronic music. They need to be seeking it out. Not just rock, jazz, and blues. Take a look at WOMH. Regardless of the drama over the outdoor stage, they are bringing in a cool mix of music.

lol. OK buddy, it's not racism if you never outright say the words "black people". Right. 
Cheerleaders for the free market never see the irony in believing they have a right to profit. \n\nAnyway, by breaking even on a house, I meant buy at 100k, and sell some day for 100k plus inflation. I don't mean living there for free. People should feel lucky they can do that, but no, everyone expects their house to be worth much more than they bought it for. Well, if everyone believes something, then it usually becomes what is, and so it is. Housing prices go up because people think it's worth more than it used to be. If I owned a house, I would hope it never went up in value, or even lost value, in order to limit my tax burden, but then I wouldn't buy a house unless I planned to live there for a long time. My goal, as should be the goal of every homeowner, would be to own the house and be able to afford living there on almost no income, if necessary. Renting was supposed to be for short term, but owning a house became a status symbol and so... \n\nAs for a car being an investment. No. Again, just no. Don't have people fucking up car prices like they have the cost of housing by everyone in america expecting their cars to go up in value for every year they have owned it.  \n\nChrist, the last recession, the one we never really dug out of, was defined by people being "underwater" on their houses. That is how fucked up this is. People expect so much to make a profit on their houses, that it helped define an era when some people couldn't do that. \n\n> if you hate the free market so much, why don't you try moving elsewhere? There's plenty of places for that... \n\nI don't like the winters in Norway. Winter here is great. 
That surprises me. When I smoke, which is admittedly not very often, I get very thirsty. A cold beer tastes great on top of smoking a little weed. It might have more to do with the socioeconomics of the audience. Like, beer at fitz isn't cheap. Drinks are even more. Their bar is not a good deal, at least when I went for a show in 2015. 
I've never been to Barbarella. I love electronic music tho and will seek out a DJ if they're good.

Applying labels to yourself and others only marginalizes what we have to say. There's too much name calling in the world of debate and people don't even realize it.

You can look at demographic groupings all you want, but on a micro level, racialism doesn't make sense to me, and I hope you can clear up a few things:\n\n**If all non-europeans have significantly lower IQ's, why is it even possible for non-europeans to have high IQ's?**\n\nRace realists brush them off as outliers, but if IQ *really is genetic* as you are asserting, **why shouldn't high IQ Europeans procreate with high IQ non-Europeans?**\n
I'm glad you opened the portal, I'm transcending mindgrapes right now, brother.
Where's the Freikorps when you need them?
Choosing to live in the public eye is an expression of vanity.
Aside from government intervention, why would any business *want* to hire someone who's mentally disabled? 
That's a silly idea, but sure why not?
This parody deserves a parody of its own.

What's with the ad hominem? I asked an honest question
Race is a social construct, no one can be racist. :)
I saw Hillary Rodham Clinton at a grocery store in Washington D.C yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything.\nShe said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and then her secret service guy came up behind me and covered my mouth with a chloroform soaked rag.

tfw people downvote because your post conflicts with their opinions but they don't comment or make a productive discourse.
I visited r/altright occasionally. I didn't agree with everything they stood for, but I'm sad to see it go. \n\nSilver lining: I'm looking forward to Murdoch Murdoch's take on this.

Thank you. This is really what I need to hear. I can't really talk to friends that much because none of them have been through this. They kind of don't know what to say and just try to drag her through the mud which just makes me feel worse.
Except if they can be replaced with robots they will be regardless of wage.
This post was made most certainly due to the top post yesterday in TIL that DnD is popular in prisons but since dice can't be used they use cards instead. Problem has already been solved.
Ah yes this bullshit. Stbxw said those exact words. She wanted me to "fight for her" from another guy. Crazy talk. I shouldn't have to look over my shoulder and fight for the person who said I do. 
Go back. Craft a 99 thunder and 4-6 scorpion barbs. Hit him with the venomcast thunder about 4 times and down he goes as long as you wait out for the poisons full damage. I've got my clip saved if you want to see it.
This keeps me going right now. My daughter is only 9mo so she won't remember any of this. She will know when she's older at some point and I just hope I can raise her well enough to know what her mother did and is doing is not okay and unhealthy.
Note to those who may not know. You can change the camera distance in battle in settings. 
Woo! Awesome bro! I do not have a belt at the moment so I stole one of my older sisters. She's 31 and has two kids. She isn't huge but the look on her face when I put on her belt because my old one was out of notches was priceless.
This is why abortion debates will never be settled. Most people say it's fine in some circumstances, even the Catholic Church does. However, the person argument is a valid one. I am pro choice but I understand where anti-choice stance comes from. Even I believe there should be a cut off point to allow one but where that  point falls is tricky. At what point does the fetus rights override the woman's? Sex is our base instinct after food and sleep, which is why I support free contraceptives for all. Allow people to be human and have sex while reducing unwanted pregnancies. To be against that, to me, is then trying to control what someone can and can't do in their own bedroom, car or wherever you like to fuck.
No but it has confirmed dlc. Which I can only assume is going to follow the ME3 and DAI route of being a huge part of the main story and not a side part. Even sans season pass I will no longer be paying full price for the game and dlc.
Bought new better fitting clothes recently. Now everyone at work thinks I'm some guru. 
Fine, hundreds.
Never used Kik. Downloading now just for this
Yeah. I recently just bought new clothes since it was time. Down from 280 to 210 and I had too. People at work finally noticed my weight loss due to now having baggy clothes. They think I'm some guru now and can't fathom what I'm doing. The number of people who keep saying I must be starving and giving me advice on low fat is astounding. I get "what no pasta or bread how do you live!" Is crazy. Even people who are bigger than I was tell me they couldn't do it. Even after seeing me at 70 down in 8 months. 
Why are you nodding at people's dicks? A little personal, no?\n\nUS nob also means dick.
To me the sexual assaults is an issue but not the adultery. What happens in a marriage is that couples business not anyone elses. Same goes for Bill Clinton. If it was consensual then it's no one else's business. This is coming from someone who's marriage was ruined do to my ex cheating. That shouldn't affect their professional life.
Woah that just put that whole Muslim thing into a much clearer perspective for me.
I just dropped out of obese. Still 30 pounds to normal. GREAT JOB! looking to joining you soon.
Basically I cheat sometimes and I don't follow a strict regiment. I take vitamins and I just make sure to stay away from carbs. Some people do a strict diet with weights and macro counts. I don't but it's still working. Until I plateau for a week or more I'll just stick to what I'm doing.
I'm on the fence. At this point I absolutely want something to fill the gaps and flesh out the choppy at best story. On the other hand if we get that I'm going to bitch because now i have to pay them more to fill in the story.\n\nAlternatively if it's a side story I can't complain because they gave me their full story I don't have to pay extra for the whole thing. I can bitch because their full story was choppy and I want them to fill in the gaps. \n\nI'm bitching no matter what. 
Biggest advice I've ever received for any cl buy. Don't do it at home. Buyer or seller. Pick a public place for the exchange. I always suggest a police station parking lot. In fact the station near me has an area with lights and a camera at all times specifically for this. Also don't show up if you aren't serious, wastes both of your time.
Tattoo question. I started at 280 and am down to 210. I do not currently have tattoos but I really want to. It doesn't look like it to me but I want to ask if your weight loss has distorted them at all and if so how much? I'm scared to get one if it's going to look weird in a few months 
They all would. Just like Trump and the people in his administration do or will while in office. Something something different sins but still sinners.

That is kind of the point. The big guys pushing this stuff are trying to stop competition to where they don't have competition unless they okay that competition.
I'm in your boat. I've heard from everyone it's not if you drop but when.
Two months in. Legally separated and both in with family. These are the questions I want answer to as well. Like others have said there are no good answers. Not a single thing she says can be trusted and even if it could whatever the real answer is will not make you feel better, no matter what that answer is. I only just stopped asking these questions recently after I realized that.

Part of the affair fog. Both the cheater and the OW/Om get it.
Yet another point for proponents of single payer healthcare right there. Uncouple business from healthcare and it can no longer be used as a bargaining chip.
Kudos bro. This is one of those things I look for when I'm somewhere new on the way in. My dad always taught me to know your way out of whatever building or area you were in before something happens. Thank you for helping me do that.
Just hit 38. Feels great. Thought I was good but I'm still going. You will too!
Idk I still like the narrative that podesta was the victim of a phishing scam like he is my fucking grandpa being scammed from a Nigerian prince.\n\nSide note, both my grandpa's are dead and even in their 80s weren't that technologically inept.
I am hovering at 201-202 and it's killing me. 
Yeah. It's okay to be critical of this game guys. It doesn't mean you hate it and square should burn. In fact imo if you gloss over the rushed second half and give them a pass it makes it even more acceptable in the future.
well fuck.
I wouldn't call anything in TW3 a dungeon though. Just a cave or castle you've seen before. The story is absolutely 12/10 which makes up for that shortfall. TW3 holds the top spot for my all time single game RPG experience. Imo it was so far over the bar it's unfair to other games that the bar to be set to that standard and say if it's not as good then its a bad game ( I know you did not say that). Now if CDPR does it again with their next game (don't remember the name atm) then it's time to raise that bar.
Kinda made me mad regardless
Good, more bootstrap lifting! We need to make it even harder to impossibly lift yourself up by the bootstraps. Otherwise we are just lazy and want handouts. Come on bros do we even lift?
When given the choice of a Republican-light and a Republican, Republicans choose a Republican everytime. Hillary was garbage and knew she couldn't win progressives she just hoped we would be scared of big bad Trump.
Get ready to switch again. Rumor has it LG is going to switch to non removable batteries.
As the person on the other side of this. DO NOT BLAME HIM FOR YOU CHEATING.Do not justify it. There is absolutely no justification for it and trying to make him think it is his fault is the worst thing you can do. You did that not him and it was for entirely selfish reasons.\n\nHe can try to work on whatever issues you say he has but blaming him is going to make him resent you even if he tries to and says he forgives you.
I rarely see the Democrats as a whole supporting strengthening these programs. They may start with an idea then they lose ground in compromising, which is fine it's supposed to work that way. However then Republicans attack the compromise to get more of what they want and spineless Dems roll over and give it to them saying something is better than nothing. They never fight back to go in the other direction. They are spineless cowards. Hell look at Warren the "champion of the little guy" she didn't even make a statement about DAPL until AFTER the decision. Wtf where the fuck was she for the last year while Jill was getting arrested and Bernie made an appearance. She was hiding in a closet like a coward waiting to follow whichever way the wind blew, same with her god damned endorsement. 
Thank you. I rarely use the search with how broken it is most of the time. I'll read through that now.
I'm clinically depressed. Makes not getting worked up pretty easy :/
took an abrupt nosedive*\n\ngot you bro
I'm going through a divorce right now. Thank you for this.
Do yourself a huge favor, water only. It's tough for a week or so but know I don't even think about drinking anything else.
Divorce and custody battle, come on lucky 7s
Best. You meant best.
The best
TW3 had side stories. They are made possible by a massive lore background. Same thing with Mass Effect. It's hard to build that background lore when you start from scratch every game. I am hoping for the next FF, now that they have a group who have experience with more open worlds, they can move some of the resources they needed for the learning curve on this one to lore and story building instead.
I have a long time friend of 10 years who is also a single parent of a little girl just a year older than my daughter. We made plans to have singles dinner at her house to let the girls play. No funny business not that kind of friendship but it will be nice to be in the company of a woman who doesn't find me repulsive.
I am not far from onederland and I fit in 38s. I went from wearing 44s until they were way to baggy before buying. Weight is coming off slower so I was going to buy a couple pants at each size but I guess it's better to wait then? I'll just skip the 36s thanks for the info.
Well it's semantics I think. Some of kh3 team helped on 15. So technically part of the team who worked on 15 are working on kh3.
7 years together. 2 married. 10mo daughter. 2 months separated. It's hard. Part of me wishes we hadn't had our daughter because I wouldn't have to speak to her. I love my daughter more than anything and don't regret her because I wanted a child so bad. Be the best father you can, even when it's hard. I find myself missing my stbxw sometimes because I remember us playing together with our daughter ,bathing her and things like that. Make sure whatever happens between you two that you never bring your child into it. Your child did nothing wrong and should never be used as a bargaining chip. You two will be linked forever and just try to be the best coparents you can. Even though my stbxw cheated on me since before we were married I have to be strong and make sure our daughter is safe and stable, that includes never being able to go off on my stbxw for the time being until things are final. I would never take our child from her but there are things I want to say that I have to keep hidden until custody is final so she doesn't try to fight our agreement. Stay strong brother. I can't say it gets better because right now for me it's not, but I hear it does.
The Mass Effect franchise is my all time favorite franchise hands down. However, I am not buying Andromeda exactly for this reason. I'll wait for a cheap game of the year edition and deal with it. I'm done with paying $100 dollars after dlc and season passes.
Same. We hit every point. Oh and her affair because of it. Fuck man I wish I could go back.
Samsung is on record wanting to drop Android. They already did so with their smart watches. They made imo the best hardware in the smartwatch then gimped it by using tizen. It has no support and shit apps. They think moving away from Android is a good move.
nah. i used 99 thunder and mixed it with 4 scorpion barbs. Made a 110 potency with level 99 poison on it. made 4 casts of it. just stay up top and hit him with it. then just stay up there and who cares if your team dies. hit him again every time the poison wears off. after 4 casts i finished him off with gladiolus whirlwind thing. very little interaction but it got the job done at lvl 5. i have a clip of it. i died once i think and used a mega phoenix.\n
Echoing everyone. Get out. My stbxw cheated on me. Admitted it. Said we could work on it. Then she continued. A lot of times the admition is them reliving themselves of guilt and nothing more. More than one chance is allowing it to continue because it shows you won't leave. Get out. You deserve better the same way I do.
Lmao this was great thank you. I've already been trying to get healthier. I'm down from 270 to 225 in 6 months and will keep pushing. I keep having this vision in my head of me losing all this weight, working out and making her super jealous. 
Well since season 2 will be the "Critical Failure" I hope it goes into the critical failure that happened 30 years ago that William stopped. That was never addressed which leaves a huge area of exploration while seeing the unfolding critical failure in the "present" era.
If there's one thing about Trump I know it's that I don't know what the fuck he's going to do. That may be good, may be bad if not at least a little scary.
10 years an uncle of 2. 9months a father of 1. I relish in my uncle time while my sister and I swap kids.
Idk first part was funny, second part made me dislike Thor a little. He just came off as a super asshole to me.
It scares me a little. I mean is it really a one time thing? Or will they release it as a permanent fixture later? Only in January so I have to change dates on my system if it's not January? This is really confusing.
Thank you. I've kind of been off grid for a couple days. She left to stay at her mom's a bit to clear her head as she put it. I don't want to leave but I also don't want to take our daughter from her. If I made her leave it would be for her mother's house which is barely a safe place for an adult much less a baby. I'm just stuck. I really appreciate the kind words. This is really what I needed.
I'm down from 280 to 210 right now. Been at it for about 6 months. I do lazy keto as far as macros go but I know my carb intake is def under 10 a day. I made the mistake this morning of eating a kolache* that someone brought a box to work. I hate half of one. About the size of a Hawaiian roll. My stomach feels like I have an iron bell in it. I feel so heavy now. Instant regret.
Did you at least recently do sheets?
She was one of my employees at an old job at a mall when I was about 19. She had put her two weeks in since she was moving away. She asked me her last night in town to come help her finish packing. Sure no problem so I headed over after we closed the store. Got to her house and there was nothing left to pack. She said since it was so late I could just sleep over and since there was stuff on the couch in boxes I could just sleep in her bed. Okay. So I changed hopped in she kept scooting closer to me. Closer.closer. Until she was right on me and we were spooning. Okay she must be cold. Had my arm around her. Then fell asleep. \n\nFuck at 19 I was stupid.
Must be nice to have all that democracy where you can make a new party and lead.
Thank you so much for the advice! Will start this tomorrow morning.
For the love of God please let 16 have a well told story. 15 has a ton of positives but damnit if I haven't seen a mess of a story that big in a long time.\n\nIf speeding up makes the story out to be told by a 5 year old the way 15 is, please take more time 
Thanks for clarifying, I was confused with being h happy at 100lbs lol
All depends on state. Louisiana for instance has an at fault which denied my stbxw any alimony. No other ramifications and if kids are involved has nothing to do with them. Divorce and custody are separate issues and should not be mixed, the judge if it comes to it will do what's in the best interest of the child and one parent being a cheater does not make them a bad parent.
Right there with you. I'm on a g5 right now. In a year and half when I'm looking for a swap I'll be eyeing a Sony most likely. Samsung has dropped off for me and lg is looking to follow. I have never had an HTC I liked and didn't swap within a week.
You will fall in and out of friendships. That's okay. Forever friends are nice but sometimes right now friends are exactly what you need. People who are experiencing exactly what you are and not on a different path. People who can change your life then never see again. Just remember you are the same thing to them.
I don't know what those words mean and I want to. What is stretch and foam roll?
http://pastebin.com/KYJNWGug\n\nThat's what you are referring to? It's pretty much the same exact ending except Javik is the catalyst. \n\nUnless you are talking about Karpyshyns interview about some of the other ideas about dark matter and big crunch possibilities. In which case just like he says in the interview, they were only ideas and are vapourware at this point and were never fully fleshed out. Meaning those ideas always seem perfect if they don't exist.
Didn't stop the guys over at Segway.
Same. When I hit my first goal I got a little too excited and slacked. Stalled for 3 weeks completely. I don't really let anyone know my goals even when I reached the first 2 because I didn't want to get the satisfaction before I hit my final. I feel you on that.
The Darth Vader comics from marvel do a wonderful job of showing how calculating, ruthless and powerful Vader is. I recommend everyone read them for even more of what you saw from R1.
That's my biggest real gripe with the game (other being lack of outfits). TW3 didn't have side quests, it had side stories. TW3 is too new of a game for devs who took notice to have put into games. I'm hoping in a year or two games will have similar side stories instead of quests.
Truthiness is a word now. And it fits perfectly.\n\n"the quality of seeming or being felt to be true, even if not necessarily true."\n\nBut hey the Clintons coordinated with Colbert so now that word is invalid.
I don't agree with most of trumps policy promises with the exception of TPP and increased border security and deportation of illegals when they are caught (sans wall and door to door deportation force). But damnit if I'm not surprised and kind of jealous he is at least starting his promises after all the other asshats who just lie to us then do what they want. Disclosure I hate Trump and voted for Sanders.
I'm pretty positive those events were supposed to be part of the game. At least a large variation. I have a feeling a crunch for time meant they needed to outsource a version of what was supposed to be in game to save time.
#curiosity and awe\n\nThat's how everyone looks first time they see a pussy!
I mean, technically vintage is within the considered range of 25-50 years.. \n\nSo it's still got some time left!\n\nIn 2 years (20) it will be considered *Classic* though!
As far as I know the kiddos over at /r/cosplay only care about the breasts.
Is it tiny though? It looks normal.\nThe left hand looks like a power gauntlet of some kind so of course it's larger, right?
I'll say this about counseling. I went to 4 sessions. 2 with different councilors. They both came to the conclusion that while they were more than willing to see me if I felt I needed it, they said they didn't think I did. After her affair and me trying to work through it then the next one I had a long time to come to terms before finally coming to terms that divorce was the right option. I admit my faults because while the affair was her choice and her path, which was not my fault, there are things I could have been and done better. I am working on these flaws with friends and family so one day I can love again and do it right. So my daughter will have a positive woman in her life and know what a healthy positive relationship looks like. Don't blame yourself for the affair, but acknowledge your faults so someone else can love you the way you deserve, this doesn't necessarily mean counseling.

It is. I'm on mobile and don't feel like finding the source article, but the head of Lucas basically said buckle up because you will probably never see the last Star Wars movie. They have them going forward essentially forever.
Not a Trump supporters but I will support him for things I agree with including his stance on tpp. The script flip yesterday here threw me for a fucking loop. Wtf reddit.
You can hit triangle to share. Once the option for what to share it on pops up you can back out. At that point the shit is saved to your ps4 gallery. Copy it to a USB. Though that's the hard way. Sharing to FB or Twitter then saving and posting is way easier.
Learned not genetic, I think. I have issues expressing my emotions. All of them. Ruined my marriage and many relationships before it. My dad never showed affection to my mom in public same as my grandfather. I saw that and it carried over into private and public. I just hold everything in. It sucks yo.
Also why isn't the other 5 million good enough?
Not judging, but you were on match you did have intentions lol
So where do babies in king cakes come in?

I feel like her torso isn't the problem.\nShe's got booty cheek dimples or something. \n\nThere's literally a concave look to them, if only somehow the flutes could fill out that small gap on each side it would be glorious.\n\nBut, alas, something's aren't meant to be.
While I'm inclined to agree.\nThe internet is not a safe space. Especially not Reddit, or most forums.\n\nPeople blurt out whatever comes to mind, and if you post something, it's going to be criticized like no tomorrow lol. \n\nEdit: the 4 comments that are "negative" are like, super super tame. 
If it's any consolation, every time I meet a girl at a rave I have to be that guy asking to see an ID before I get too carried away... \n\nGirls get touchy and I don't think fake IDs would defend me in court. \n\nRave girls are deceptive. 
I got Michelle Obama holding a picture with TMZ on it \n\nThen I got a gif of a black girls ass twerking.\n\nIs this a sign? Is former misses of the White House asking to have her twerk video sent to TMZ!? \n\nWhy was I given this burden!
I completely understand that this portion of the game may have taken precedence over some more crucial aspects, however, I actually enjoyed building.\n\nEspecially on PC, i spent many hours just making ridiculously detailed settlements with stories I made up, for no *real* reason, other than my own enjoyment lol. Remind d me of GMOD.\n\n"I don't know why I'm doing this but I enjoy it!".\n\nThough I still entertain that it maybe should have played a way smaller roll. Either that it played a smaller roll or that it played a bigger one, it just feels kind of "thrown in" just because.
My totally uneducated guess is that physics plays a big roll in that difference. 
You paused and manually clicked quick save instead of just pressing F5?
You think some pink triangles is too early? /s
I haven't and won't be able to play it for a while, but it looks like RYSE style gameplay, is that at all accurate? \n\nAt first I thought it was similar to Dark Souls PvP but after seeing some gameplay it doesn't seem *that* complicated..\n\nAnxious to play the damn thing, no doubt it at least looks fun.
I can only imagine the feeling. I'm sure it's quite weird, like a mental swirl (idk the word) feeling. \nThe imagination must go wild laying in a spot like that, pretty wild.\n\nRefrigerating dead bodies is a crazy concept in itself, even though it makes 100% scientific sense. It's weird. \nAlways wanted to do something like that! The most I ever did was visit Alcatraz at night and do some off the rails exploring. Closed one of the cell doors in the block and laid there for a little. 
It's probably not *trashy* per say, but I fucking hate seeing people with their feet on the dash. I just hate feet. \n\nI especially hate I'm  in my car and someone thinks it's ok to put their fucking foot up, keep your fucking shoes on or get out of my car.
I was recently at a rave in San Fran, and was talking to an older woman (like grandma old) and she said she started raving in the early 70's. \n\nLike In the acid pioneering missile solo raves.\n\nShe was fucking awesome and I like to think these dorky ass 90's ravers are still kicking it from time to time.\n\nEverybody is this gif looks like ecstasy just came to market and they are new to rolling.
Suddenly it got weird. 
Am I missing something? What's wrong with sky rim dialogue? It doesn't have a short story for every quest? I get that.\n\nBut I've never gotten (or don't remember) a quest where the sole info was "Hey dragon born, kill 5 bears." It's usually got *some* kind of short story. \n\nHey these farmers are reporting some kind of animal attacking the sheep and eating the crops, go see if you can help them out!\n\nIt's simple as fuck, and written like every radiant quest. But that's old news. Isn't skyrim like 6 years old now?
As someone who has no clue about football, what do these words mean? \n\nHooligan / ultras. \n\nI'm guessing it's some tier of fan-ship. But I'm surimi's as to why someone would *want* to portray that as a lifestyle? Is it like die hard fans or something? \n\nAnd I'm guessing Arsenal is a team.
Or big globe master planes. I've seen them rolled out of the big ass KC whatever's.

The thing I don't like is, it could just say "I must find my killer" or something.\n\nJust as every other picture could say "who stole the water chip!?" Or whatever. \n\nIt just seems lazy.
I really enjoyed the division. It was the first game in a while I was able to play at launch because I happened to have some free time.\n\nI was pumped.\n\nI actually had a blast playing it, I liked the mechanics, I was finding good loot and upgrades. I was doing well for myself, which was cool. But, like your friends, I lasted about 2-4 weeks. I ran out of solo content, at least fun things to keep me coming back. The Dark Zone was a joke, I played solo so I didn't stand a chance. And when I did, some hacker would snipe me from across the city through walls.\n\nStill, I trudged along, hoping it would get better.\nWell? It didn't. And I haven't played the game since:(

I know some adults that don't agree with modern currency. Not like they have a choice but the whole "implied" value thing upsets them lol. \n\nMaybe that's why it's not on the list? I dunno.
Fucking nailed it OP.\nLooks awesome lol.\n\nHow's the weight? \n\nIf you've held an actual M4, how's the size compare?\n\nI really dig the clips curve and bullets, that's pretty creative.
I don't think the post was that serious.\nIt seemed kind of lighthearted.\n\nWhatever you've been through I'm sorry for it and hope you recover well.\n\nBut it's not the same for everyone, I think it's rather subjective. \n\nBut I'll accept maybe I'm an asshole I just don't care all that much, it's just a game.

Nailed the outfit, but I gotta recommend a change of scenery, it comes off a little sexual. \n\nStill a solid outfit!
Staring into the sun might do it.\n\nShe accidentally stared into the sun for a few hours.
The picture may not be too creepy, but this dudes Wiki is pretty fucking wicked.
Just play dark souls. \nThat's my current obsession, and you really *cant* save, or even pause until you get to a bonfire or get somewhere safe, respectively . So.. 
I'm sure I'll get down voted as this seems to be an unpopular decision, but oh well.\n\nLEGO movie references and nostalgia aside, I know Lego had *very* humble beginnings. And I understand this is a classic set, and I respect it for that, it's pretty neat really, it's so simple.\n\nBut god damn, this looks like something a 7 year old puts on Lego ideas. People have built cooler things from extra set parts. I'm not trying to dog it, I just can't help. It notice just *how* little it actually is, even considering the playability. And at the time, (like video games) I'm sure it was the shit. I just can't get over it, the UCS Hoth set is this x5, and was shit on by a lot of people. This set trying to appear (I know it's not) in today's market wouldn't even make it off the builders desk.\n\n\nTL;DR Not all Lego sets hold up with age. I respect it for what it is, classic, and for the nostalgic reasons. I'm just in awe of how "bare-bones" it is.
I don't mind as long as it's not near houses, I could care less on most roads.\nI have a loud exhaust myself but it's not irrationally loud or anything.\n\nI only really mind when it's a lifted truck with the exhaust pipes to the sides, and when it pulls up next to me it's blowing it's fucking exhaust directly into my face, and I'm deafened when this chimney truck takes off in a cloud of black smoke.\n\nI'd rather hear rices out hondas fart down the road that's these fucking steam engines.
If you aren't using bartender with 4-5 rows stacked lower center screen, you're probably clicking.
That dude just sounds so defeated lol.\nHe's like "daw no even your butt ain't poppin."\n\nHe tried lol.
When my mom brought around the dude she had been seeing for the first time, I made sure to bring out my all. \n\nMade sure to spike up my hair (was a 16inch Mohawk, bright orange.) put on my most edgy clothing (blue and plaid "bondage" pants, still have them) and turned on the circle jerks real loud. \n\nThis fuckin guy walks into my room, which is covered wall to wall in posters and what not, and shakes my hand and just says "Nice hair dude" with the biggest most cheesy smile. And walks in my room and just starts talking. \n\nMy "wall" totally failed, long story short the dude is an awesome and married my mom.\nShout out to Mitch for holding it down!
Odin thinks differently!
Did you post it? Now I'm curious.
I'd like to say they are still the same:)\nThat's not necessarily the *motive* for most people. \nBut sex and drugs are there. \n\nUsually one gets you the other, if that's the goal. \nAlmost clubs have a bar but it's more MDMA or Coke that's common around here.
I've got a vegan friend that's never had a hamburger.\nBut he admits they *look* objectively tasty.\n\n\nBut he also likes manburger so I think it's invalid.
Then her stop better be soon because I mm willing to bet, that she's gonna have to use the bathroom soon. \n\nAlways makes me have to shit, so I cut a line on the counter (home) while I deuce lol.
Right?? \n83 *STONE* !?\n\nThose smug British bastards and their geological measurement system. The fuck is a stone. Stones have different weights. 
Made me think of mudvayne lol.
I think the cringe is that the entire "protest" has just totally invalidated itself by hypocrisy.\n\nThough it was stupid from the jump. Now it's brain dead.
If the burden of autistic truth is enough to make you unsub from any sub. Then perhaps Reddit is not the place for you.\n\nAutism lurks in every corner. Manifested in bodies we know as "mods".

I don't know you so forgive me if this next part is ignorant.\n\nBut I'm *guessing* you guys did well financially (or she did, obviously) to not notice 10k a month vanishing into her nose.\n\nThat's insane. That's *SO* much fucking Coke.\nWith 10 grand you could potentially buy a bar, which might be 2pounds of cocaine.\n\nTWO POUNDS OF COKE a month!! That's insane lol, she had to be *on* 24/7 to avoid that comedown.\n\nThat's insane. \nI'm glad (assuming) you are away from that. At that level she is invested in people that you do not want to be affiliated with.
My girl always gets mad when we argue or something. And she's like "I can tell you have things to say in your head just *say* them." \n\nAnd I literally don't have shit in my head, maybe a song or something but nothing that contributes lol.
Mm. I gotta disagree. \nI know plenty of raver girls who dress like this.\nI'll happily post pictures. \n\nThey aren't 16 year old kids they are like *seasoned* ravers lmao. The first rave I went to in Cali, my roll made me fall in love with this chick dressed like this but as a unicorn. 
Just bought my first every PlayStation (4) yesterday to use while I'm home visiting, I only got that instead of an Xbox because I've always wanted to play Bloodborn.m, and Nioh looks badass too.\n\nGameStop had BB for $17 as well!\nAnd I'm already completely fucking lost. Wandering around the town, got smashed by some big boss already. Good times.
I know there are stronger pills, but I'd like to it's a norco, because I used to enjoy them. Second favorite pill "taste".
You are correct, however, on Reddit and many other places. If the nudity is not traditionally attractive or directed towards OP, it's trashy. 
Seriously?...\n\nThese people should be clipped and spayed then. Sure, get married. But don't reproduce your filth.
My life has definitely changed drastically since my "punk/alternative" phase. \n\nBut, fuck man. I still love me some Job For A Cowboy and The Casualties.\n\nSomething's don't get old and I don't want them too lol. 
I'm at work right now, so forgive me if this comment sounds a bit uneducated and naive, because it probably is.\n\nI was just taking to a coworker about how I want to play a new MMO as I'm bored or lost interest in the pens I've played (specifically WoW). \n\nI played the beta of ESO, and I loved it, I had a blast exploring and learning with all the new potential players. So when thinking and looking for a new MMO, and recently been on a Skyrim kick again, I figured I'd check on ESO and see how it's doing.\n\nSeems to be doing great! \nI wanted to ask, how is the community? The sub seems great but that's only a small part (I'd imagine).\n\nI remember the game being kind of slow and the grind being kind of boring. Has anything happened to change that? Or is it more or a personal feeling.\n\nI've seen already that the content is in *no* shortage so that's awesome. I'm just hesitant about joining the game this late, and struggling to keep up. Is there any resources (this sub? I will research and browse more after work) to give me some ideas of what to do? \n\nI don't want to pretend it's TES6, because it's not meant to be. I look at the game now and it *looks* good, I'm anxious to start playing again, I think it deserves another shot.
Sounds like a certain SO should chill out, it's not that serious.
Can cellulite be reduced with a certain workout/s?\nIs it a diet workout combo? I've always assumed it could be.\n\nIf she keeps up she'd be looking way fine soon, not hat I'd complain as it is. But since I'm judging on the internet, I will. \n\nAlso don't be fooled by the side profile shots! Hides the actual size of things...

Did he edit his comment? It doesn't seem angry at all, certainly not a perplexing level.
Is it really? I remember years ago, why I stopped drinking Coke.\n\nI was like 12 and was drinking a can, and like an hour or so later that shit was like flakes, I just thought it might have been a nasty can lol.
Sometimes I'll have like a few videos tabbed.\nAnd I'm thinking to myself "fuck yea I'm gonna go again after cuz these videos are ballin".\n\nThen Literally immediately after I close all the tabs and have never felt so unhorny.
Not really *creepy*. It's more like the doodles edgy kids in high school scratched during class, secretly hoping people notice and spread rumors about how "CRAZY " and edgy the dude is. I dunno. 
I mean, I've seen excision play at a club that closed at 2. That was a rave. Hula hoops and all.\n\nThe big cool ass renegade rave/parties that went all night into the morning aren't as common as they used to be:( 
Why are you being downvoted..
Just a little booga sugar baby.
Sounds like the military.\nWe have this shitty half ply paper that your tends to *give way*.\n\nBut we are paid 24/7 working or not, so some of us make use of free time by spending some time in the latrine.\n\nI'd love to go home to drop off Seal Team Shits but coming in and out the gate is miserable.
Surprisingly enough the picture isn't edited, according to OP. (Just the name)
Nice!\nDid you make it??
Yea I never really got the skinny cokehead referance.\n\nIt's usually because of *crack* cocaine paired with it and whatever else.\n\nI used pretty heavily and I was actually mad about it because I didn't lose any weight lol. At the time, obviously, my peiorities were a little out of whack, being upset that my Coke habit didn't help my physical fitness...
I don't like that I see a PC tower, I'd imagine hooked up to that large TV. There's no chair. \n\nSo does this person squat to play PC games? I don't even see room for a mouse. Maybe a controller user?\n\nLooks like a keyboard on the side of the bed, if this dude sits in "bed" all fucking day it's got to be terribly uncomfortable and I'm sure the slump game is strong. Doesn't seem comfortable for much besides sleeping in a tent for the weekend.
Well I'd say you nailed that!
I doubt this is the same dude, but the guy on the right looks exactly like s guy I went to high school with, he was a skin then too. And he *always* had chicks, and good looking ones, I never understood how. \nHe even brought girls to his cousins party to hook us up with.  Dude was a legend, despite all his racism.\n\nOn another note, in my teens I hung out in a place like this, kind of a strange feeling I haven't thought of in years. (Minus the racism aspect, just poor "punk" kids)
Kind of looks like it might be an arm in the middle, with the elbow resting on the elephant hips and her arms bent, with the forearms resting upon the breaths.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE hibiscus, orchids, and plumerias.
Technically bacteria is a living thing right?\nSo wouldn't it be against veganism to eradicate them by purifying the top? \n\n
I'm sure someone else's touched on this but, with the walls being round, wouldn't that make for some off placement of utilities or the inability to hang pictures from the surrounding walls?
If you aren't aware, that literally is the function lol.\nIt blows off the top two engines. \n\nSomeone posted a video a few posts below this one (at the time, it's on YouTube) and it's hilariously wonderful. They just get kicked right off.
Are you really? That's dope.\n\nSomeone with no credentials identifying body language here, they looks nervous and caught off guard. Especially when she decided to take her clothes off and damn near stripped her nude. \n\nI mean right off the bat the dialogue was hard to experience.
Is Warhammer 40K a grown up hobby?\nBecause that shit is ridiculously expensive, and you are paying for a product you have to (*get* to) build and color!\n\nWhen I first started I spent like $300 on starter stuff.\n\nThen I decided I loved cars. Now I am poor.
And I'm told they are a pain in the dick to work on, and I can tell you they are an experience to fly in, I don't think I liked it haha.
What makes you think he's jacked?
They have the right look, there's an aura that being on Coke gives, and they've got it.\nHowever, the energy and gitteryness isn't there. \n\nSo I'd rule out the booger sugar. \nI think they are just nervous as fuck and terrible actors. 
I mean I'd be pretty upset lol.\nBut I also wouldn't have drove 1.5 hours to meet some chick that hasn't sent me pictures...\n\nNever let thirst cloud judgement.
Like everyone else, picture number 1 made me do a complete 180.\n\nBut then 4 is like, kind of ok.\n\nShe's a tricky one! Angles and editing. \nStill a strong no, the heroin scans were a deciding factor.
No homo, you are a good lookin dude man. 
I understand how it could be "look what we're doing and how separate we are, this is what we *dont* want!"\n\nI just think it's going about it wrong somehow, I also think it's a bit much. People can stand there all day for 4 years and chant whatever they want, TPTB won't give two shits. It's a stepping stone, but it needs some real goals.
How? She was having a blast and was hella nice.\nIf you are judging how people dress at a rave you are going about the whole thing wrong :o
Been a shit day, this is nice, thanks lol.
We all bleed the same red blood of patriots.

Mr. President Fuckin Trump
I thought the actual proper term is Mr. President? \n\nEdit- that's what Washington told everyone to call him when they were close to calling him king or something.
She's an elitist fucking dickbag.

I took my mom with me when I went. We were both in and out of the sheriff's office in the courthouse in under 20 min.

America is fixed in one year. Trump just shitposts for the next 3.
Like back before I took a break there was an emperor box thing with opens and CC ones. But now all the rogue one stuff is expensive and open edition. Why are they so expensive if there isn't any limit to the card count? And is base 4 equal to expansion base? Because I see base 4 has no count from what I see.
It looks like a raging flood roared through a street art festival, and that was the remains.

Ugh I don't even wanna think about living in anti2nd law states. All it took was going to the courthouse, me not being a felon and some money and I was given my CCW permit. feelsgoodman.jpg

I got my ps4 for Xmas and bought unravel on whatever sale they had going on then.
No they came from loving pallet families, and after serving their duty they were put on a truck that took them to a nice big open warehouse for them to pallet around in.
Same here.

Ok I'll just watch in regular series order then. 
Didn't Obama refuse to give up his blackberry his first term so they made him some sort of special super encrypted blackberry something or other?
Yeah we never put pallets in the compactor. All pallets got reused or sent back to where they came from.

Popular reasons are it's hard for inner city people to use the internet or get to/find the DMV. They're actually implying with that that black people aren't smart enough to use the internet or find the DMV. They're the actual racists without even realizing it.
I'd be more worried about the antifascist crazies than the republicans.  \n\nEdit- boy this comment sure is going well. \n\nAnother one- Obama was a terrible president.

Small churches in rural communities would be shit out of luck. Nothing is as simple as you just made it seem.
Everyone that doesn't agree with them is a Nazi. \n\nEdit- hell I got called a Nazi by a bunch of people on twatter for saying that only cowards sucker punch. And that you should combat words with words and fists with fists.
I didn't think to look there. I looked in the candy, cookie aisles, and up at the register. I should have just asked. They might have been somewhere weird.

If you can't respect someone just because they don't 100% agree with you on everything there's something wrong.

That's bullshit. Be a man and tell people you were supposed to meet. I absolutely hated being stood up, and then days later you get "sorry bro I ran out but now I got more." Like motherfucker just fuckin tell me that you ran out.
I just got back on yesterday after months of being active daily on it. What's up with all the open editions? And do base 4 not have cc?
Yeah those blue pallets were tough. When I first started I asked about taking one home not knowing they weren't Walmart's.

What about Amazon trail? I got it in a box of cereal. And some Captain crunch game.
I didn't agree 100% with Jon Stewart, but I sure did love his show. He called out Obama on his bullshit as well as the Republicans. Some of his interviews and stuff were kinda shitty towards the guests, but overall I liked it 1000000x more than the current pile of garbage they call the daily show.
I meant the ultimate order one or whatever. Like which one is better for first watchers? 
Wait, we're having a lieau? Why wasn't I invited?
These schnozberries taste like schnozberries.
Open edition just means they're unlimited basically. No card count shown. So no way of really knowing how many are out there of the diff variations.

For some reason 85% of the Johnston and Murphy shoes I find are always in excellent condition. And even if the leather and everything is good but the sole needs work it isn't very expensive to get a new vibram one or something put on.
How am I supposed to know "No Agenda" is a show?  But thanks for the direction.
Why'd you get banned?
I think fewer people today than in the 50's and 60's think something is being hidden.\n\nWhat evidence do you have to the contrary?
No news is bad news.\n\nI don't think this was rigged in Trumps favor at all.  I'm not a cynic. I believe in this country.  \n\nIf you don't think he's part of TPTB though, I think that's where your blinders are.  How could someone get so much (apparent) power if they weren't?  They only allow those they trust into that area.
As water is a finite and vulnerable resource, you should always try to conserve it.

Why do you constantly just post political bulllshit that has nothing to do with conspiracies whatsoever?
Clones would be born as babies and take just as long to age as the original.\n\nDon't know what kind of point you're trying to make though.
I would agree with you, but also posit that people don't have as much time as others to deep dive into details.  Families, work, school, church, community.  It does make us all lazier that things are packaged as they are, but it also is the only way some can consume it.

Specifically who?  You said they were against him, so what did you see that showed that?  The media constantly reporting on him, giving him free press?  Top members of the FBI dropping some Shillary email shit the week before the election?  What exactly?  For the third time, I hope I'm proven wrong and everything he said in his speech today comes to fruition.  I'd love to MAGA.  I just want to know why you think he's not part of TPTB.
It's not going to have any of the books in it, per se.\nIt's a sequel to the books.

The thread title is literally "woman arrested...".  She's caught, yo.
Thanks, I've deleted my post.  I'll keep a better eye out next time.
Again, I hope I'm wrong.  But he hasn't done anything yet.  Except walk-back some of his campaign promises.

It's a video game.

And I heard they're coming for our precious bodily fluids.
Currently, 36% of Americans believe in UFOs (http://www.livescience.com/21216-americans-ufo-belief.html), in the 1950's & 1960's many people in the US thought other planets could have life on it in our solar system (In the 1950s, cults grew up around various people who claimed to have had contact with aliens, usually Venusians or Saturnians, although some turned up from Clarion, the twin of Earth that was hidden by the moon).  A lot of people were less educated than they are today (In 1959, only ~9% of the population had a college degree, that number is now higher than 30%).  Also, in 1966, 96 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll had heard of UFOs and 46 percent of them believed UFOs were real. (http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/d/dean-aliens.html) So there are about 10% fewer people today who believe in UFO's than did in the 50's, 60's.

But the problem is the movie never existed, so you didn't put it right next to Shaq's movie.\n
any idea where the subject mentioned is talked about?
I think there are a lot of children that need to be protected from their parents, but homeschooling is definitely not a reason.  \n\nBut from the article posted, it reads:\n> The Buffalo Public School system said it cannot comment on the case, but said that in order to homeschool, a parent has to have full custody of their children – but Harris said she has always had full custody.\n\nBut the original article reads:\n> The Buffalo Public School District says it cannot comment on this case due to Federal Laws but says in order for a parent to file for homeschooling, they must have full custody of the children.\n \n>Harris says she's a single parent and has always had full custody until her kids were taken away.\n\nSounds like the mother may not have full custody of the children and thus, cannot legally file for homeschooling.\n\nI'd actually like to hear the follow-up on this when the Buffalo Common Council makes its ruling.
Yep, missiletest.  http://www.ktvu.com/news/235677767-story
WTF are you talking about?  The GOP was obstructionist from the moment Obama entered the office.
The media saying it does not make it true
All of them submitted their resignations, per normal, at the end of Obama's presidency.  Trump's admin decided not to renew them.  So they resigned AND were fired.

It happens all the time to me as well.  It's how's been for years, actually.
The meaning of 'Care' in this context: At the time the script was developed, the primary meaning of the word 'care' (< O.E. cearu, "anxiety, anguish") was synonymous with 'worry', having more negative connotations than in modern times when it tends to be associated more positively with compassion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's motto is "Care.

Should probably add a /s to that
Is that why he named a bunch of them to his cabinet?
This sub is normally against TPTB...well, Trump is one of those now.  That's what some people aren't understanding.  If you're against TPTB, how can you be for Trump?  The argument that "he's going to change things" is naive and I'm not sure why anyone thinks this prez will be any different than previous, regardless of what he's said.\n\nI'd like to be proven wrong though.
Sorry, didn't even see it.
> An assistant to the secretary of state straight up saying they're setting up trump right now to be assassinated\n\nSo, this quote from OP is a lie?
What's the conspiracy?  There are tons of pre-loaded obits in press releases that have been accidentally released.\n\nIf the Queen is dead they'd say so.

That's fine if that's what you're doing.  but, /u/Tclatch's post was not just opinion.  He posted articles and evidence in the body of the thread.  The reason you gave for deletion, rule 11 (Misleading, fabricated or sensationalist headlines are subject to removal.) seems to be used only when someone doesn't like what they see.  I can find 5 other posts that break rule 11 in the first 30 posts on this subs HOT page yet nothing is done about them.

>One intriguing prospect would seem to be Dark Horse taking either old, public domain comics or maybe their own titles and applying the Mystery Science Theater 3000 approach -- the subject and his bots silhouetted at the bottom, making comments -- to a comic book itself.

Since when did Ron Paul want to build up the military to levels we haven't seen in years?
The left will continue to fail until they put up someone who's an actual leftist. 
I actually liked ['Men Who Stare At Goats'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats), which I guess is loosely based on Stubblebine as head of the project to walk through walls.

Fuck yeah do it back.  Fuck the GOP and everything they stand for.
Probably because as a regulator he voted against the move to establish net neutrality rules.
They resigned, per normal, at the end of the previous administration.  Trump's team decided to accept those resignations.

I'm fearful they will attack legalized cannabis businesses around the states with this order.
Just an interesting correlation: liver disease has been on the rise in the US for decades.  Researchers like to blame alcohol but I wonder if it's not compounded by the added toxicity of compounds like those found in Roundup.
There was a contest to do that very thing on a small scale going on that got posted here recently.
To my mind, that means entities like the CIA can override state and local laws to enforce their authority and bring charges on a federal level.  What is a 'transnational' organization in this case?

So then we have a problem in scientific fields where the public relies on legitimate scientific rigor.  This means we don't actually have science.  We have corporate-driven 'alternative facts'.

No clue as to what is being discussed, but the way it's written sure gives the perception that something '*significant*' is happening with their investigation.\n\nIf there was something criminal, or significant, wouldn't the FBI or CIA leak or release the intel? \n\nI am still seeing it as a disinformation campaign.
Collective unconscious.\n\nInnate patterns of the human psyche, i.e. memes  \n\nOr he actually had learned, heard, and known those names and images but forgot or learned them in the periphery of his cognitive processes.
I don't trust that they see that as a problem.  Having more 'crime' and more 'cartels' gives them more justification to grab more power and money.  For all we know, this EO is influenced by the CIA and DEA to maintain their black market allies and keep the flow of dark cash and funding flowing.
Conveniently ignored.

THANK YOU.
I was joking... Sort of.  My point is that no one knows what Greenwald's true personal opinion on 911 is and he should keep it that way.
My pointing out that he is gay and hated by gays is irony.  I don't disagree with you and can't understand why I am being downvoted for simply pointing out the fact that his situation is ironic.
What temp schedule are you going to ferment with? 
Yeh. The US is fucked.
Lots of fat.
It will stress them out and stop fermentation, but likely won't kill all of them.

It'd be so easy to blackmail corrupt cops, with the NSA's and FBI's parallel access to snooped and scooped data.  I'm sure they build dossiers on cops to have leverage on them when needed.

I'd rather just use caffeine in tea.  Ephedrine is tough on the cardiovascular system, especially the heart itself - hence why they banned ephedrine in the US.  But if you limit usage, and avoid dependency, it can safely be used for a short period.
As someone who sources news from independent sources and doesn't watch TV news,  I'd say:\n\nHe is objectively an arrogant, authoritarian, bigot that makes contradictory and false statements. 
True. Your experience is your own.  I respect that none of us can or should even try to explain.

That's what I was hoping.  I want to drive fermentation - start gentle and ramp up.
I still know people that literally think it's fact that Russia manipulated the elections and affected the voting directly... like hacked the voting machines or something.  Apparently smart people too... It's mind boggling that they swallowed this disinfo. 
That year was my biggest red pill.
Thank you for the input.
Presidents.
Sediment is fine.  Don't worry about it for now.  There is some evidence it might actually help the yeast.  Just let it drop out and try to avoid transferring it when you bottle/package.
It's a goddamn cruel joke.
And never had any of these petitions led to anything but a bullshit response, perfectly crafted by a team of lawyers.
I am not suggesting that.
I like that... But I have a feeling/knowing that regardless, wu-wei is the only 'effect' in effect.      
By the sheer number of people consuming bullshit... I'd say he is right.
It's helpful to have the large capacity if and when you need it.
Great response. Very helpful.
Have you tried whole leaf, high quality matcha powder?  It is much higher in l-theanine, GABA, etc which increased some of the benefits often attributed to tea.
Are you made fearful and feeling of slime by the word Lucifer? 
It's not wrong. They are the faces of liars and shills.  We won't learn to distrust their corrupt political games if we trust their avatars/charicatures.
I mean, there is no FBI investigation that I am aware of...
What specifically are your digestive problems?
I'd disagree with the comparison. Looks is a pretty clean style and can be reasonably achieved with clean ale yeasts at lower ranges of ferment temp.  Saison yeasts throw wildly different aroma and flavor compounds compared to clean ale yeasts.  I don't think it's the same...  
60% is not "full"
This is the tool you are looking for: http://www.meadmakr.com/batch-buildr/ \n\nFigure out how strong you will make a batch of 3 gal with what you have.  Then pitch the right amount of yeast and nutrient.
Very cool
Higher alcohol can mutate and stress yeast, making it less viable to re use.

Curious to hear how it goes... Interesting yeast
That shit is so shady.
I think it depends on where you are in relationship to the newest lines.
I don't want to risk contamination even with my strict sanitation.  Pouring samples back in is asking for trouble, IMO.
I hope so.  \n\nBut from my lowly civilian position, that's a huge assumption of motive and intention.  We don't know what Trump or Sessions' real goals are.\n\nI'll keep watching out and hope things are how you say.
Watery shits are not great... Typically a sign of weakened stomach/small intestine function, poor absorption in GI, and/or gut irritation. \n\nDo you have a health professional that can advise you?
Definitely.  My beer improved exponentially when I started using RO and playing with the brewing salts.  I use Brün Water spreadsheet.
What is a 'transnational' organization?  the CIA?  the DEA?  
Be careful berberine doesn't interfere with digestion.  It can cause irritation in the stomach and small intestine, leading to what essentially amounts to a weakened digestive efficiency.  It will primarily manifest as diarrhea or cramping pain.\n\nWatch your dosage and watch your body's response to it.
We should take away Medicare, social security, and build more walls.  That's how we will improve our society.  Oh and let the billionaires run the government.  It'll be amazing.\n\n\n/s

Concern trolling is the new thing. Still trying to wrap my head around it too... From Urban Dictionary: \n\nA person who posts on a blog thread, in the guise of "concern," to disrupt dialogue or undermine morale by pointing out that posters and/or the site may be getting themselves in trouble, usually with an authority or power. They point out problems that don't really exist. The intent is to derail, stifle, control, the dialogue. It is viewed as insincere and condescending.\n\nA concern troll on a progressive blog might write, "I don't think it's wise to say things like that because you might get in trouble with the government." Or, "This controversy is making your side look disorganized." 
But the problem is that almost all the people outside this forum are indeed being fooled. 
i think that has been debunked now, check the thread, it might be deleted. it was based on one tourist's comment or something.
Same old. Tow the party line Ben or else! 
This makes me want to throw up, just like when I see a slaughterhouse truck in real life. 
the customs criminal took my phone and was gone for about an hour while i waited in the waiting area. he said he was investigating the pellet gun i had declared and that's where he was. but he had my phone for an hour. i have wanted to smash it with a hammer ever since but haven't because iphone 6+'s are expensive haha. after so much time on Reddit, i might just go back to a flip phone for privacy :)
I like to remain optimistic and think, look, more people are waking up! I know, I know, but what if it was a 50/50 split :)

I meant Trump is a big distraction right now. It's keeping the Liberals very busy raging against him instead of more worthy pursuits. Governments come and go, water is kind of forever. 
Yes.
This part is definitely going to make it into my future conversations with carnists:  \n\n"I also find it interesting how some people who eat meat like to describe themselves as meat-eaters. Some even say they are carnivores. A real carnivore would have a laugh over this self-aggrandizing description. Human beings are not meat-eaters. Carnivores hunt down, pounce upon, and rip the flesh from the living body of their prey, veins in their teeth, blood on their face and the stench of slaughter in their nostrils.\n\n...In fact, the average non-vegetarian human is a carrion eater. They eat dead flesh. The correct term is necrovore.\n\nSometimes the flesh they eat has been dead for weeks or even years...\n\nHumans are closer to vultures, hyenas, and jackals than to the noble lions, tigers, and wolves they try to emulate."

Thanks SuperScoop. Here's the gist, sounds GREAT: "So we’ve done a version of stuffed shells which is three large pasta shells and each one is stuff ed with a different flavored vegan ricotta. One is stuffed with a kalamata-basil ricotta, another is stuffed with a lemon-thyme ricotta, and the third one I think is stuffed with like a garlic and shallot ricotta. And each one has a different sauce, like one has a very sort of traditional marinara sauce, one has a sort of like white wine reduction lemon sauce. And I forget the third one but it’s just this weird idea I had based on one of my favorite foods growing up. "
Sweet Gebus, it's like they just Buzz Feed-ified everything!
Oh man, I drove through Rohnert Park not long ago (it was about 20 miles out of my way)just to try Amy's. The pizza was outstanding. Also got a burger, fries and shake. All vegan. Definitely gonna try the vegan mac and cheese next time. Please bring more Amys to the world!

"I am unsure why this sub works, but it does." Agreed, it has definitely been a sanity saver for me the last few months. 
I wonder if that's writer error or a vegan version of "spinach and ricotta-stuffed shell with marinara." Can't wait to check it out, thanks!\n
Been there, done that. But nobody starts a Reddit thread about it, thankfully. 
Weighing in, see user name. I would be delighted if Pam delivered me food like this. 
Orthorexia is not real. Opting out of eating the poison is not a sickness, but big food and big pharma and Monsanto would like you to believe it is. As always, follow the money... Corporations lose money when you make healthy choices.
Carnism is the dominant hegemony, but no, I don't give a whit what the meatheads think. Keep on keeping on DinoAlien. 
that's great, now we don't have to worry about animals on the brink or animals we've already rendered extinct. Harvard can just replace them in a lab! 
My motive was part rant and part in the hope of people bringing more mindfulness to the table when consuming information here and elsewhere. I understand we all come from different places in this sub, but for me, it's alarming how little anyone reads or investigates. Memes have exploded as informational tools for a reason. Fast and easy to consume. We need to be smarter and more aware than MSM. 
Much of the New Age-y stuff is just more mind control shit. Look at Tavistock's ties to places like Esalen, etc.

Been wondering myself if deleting the FB app is enough to get my phone to stop listening to me and (running down the battery.) Obviously not... 
Why waste such brains and talent on politics?\n
yes, that is highly likely. and horrible. 
Absolutely. See example 2... when speculating, it's good to build on as much fact as we have available. Like Seaman's HuffPo creds. 
I remain unconvinced too. 
This movement had some real momentum before the election. Now everyone is too busy hating Trump to care or share anymore. Very frustrating because this a real and worthy fight. 
Exactly, it feels like a mix, especially the secret space program stuff. 
I watched Gaia for about a month or so last year, some interesting stuff but ultimately Wilcox and Corey Goode (from the 'secret space program') didn't resonate with me. Don't they have a free month offer? See what appeals and use your discernment, as always. 
True. Even the food styling is good. So many levels of what the hell is going on here. 
Anyone exhibiting severe anxiety or obsessive compulsive behaviors toward any food should have their anxiety and OCD addressed by all means. Usually both arise from trauma of some sort, be it childhood or otherwise. But make no mistake, Big Pharma - the cancer, diabetes, and statin business - is very invested in making sure you stay sick. This mental health assault on health-conscious consumers is part of that agenda. It's an effort to marginalize healthy eaters by declaring them to be mentally unwell.\n
Panago has vegan pizza in Canada, made with Daiya cheese. I presume Panago delivers the same in the US. 
He is a hustler.

Pretty standard intelligence operation.
India's dies not have the infrastructure in place to handle the level of manufacturing that China does. Beyond that you can't simply swap out on country for another in that way, the situation is far to complicated. 
If that were true his immigration order would have stood up in court, Goldman Sachs would not be in his cabinet and his team would at least spell check what they are sending out.
So why land in a densely populated area if they one of them had landing gear trouble? Edwards I just a few minutes away for them, which would have more emergency equipment.
If it was an unknown emergency sure, but landing gear? Also why both jets?
I have nothing to add other than thank you for your work. My practice has benefited greatly from your books and interviews.
It is not strange at all. Take a look at the direction of this sub for the past few months. It has been compromised. 
Really surprised someone has not come along and created a database of people who have said racist/sexist things online. I imagine a time in the future where a lot of those comments will come back to hurt people.
An industry shill would have mention that coke is a healthy part of any breakfast and how can corn syrup be bad for you, it has corn in the name.
The flat earth thing seemed to just really come on strong all of the sudden and not based on any current event. For example the pizza business took off based on the election and leak of info, but other  theories that are not based on events seem to take a bit longer to really surface in a big way. For example the electric universe theory or the work of Graham Hancock. As someone who does user research it just looked like a test to judge how fast a fringe idea can spread if pushed in the right way.\n\nJust my 2 cents.
Both planes? 
I think that really depends on your overhead. I have seen some pretty steep prices for workshops so I think there is an opening there to make some money. I think a lot of people would benefit from seeing what it would take to build one and the process of setting up land, power, water and waste. You could help people save some money before they get started. In addition plans along with instructions for laymen would be a nice thing to have.
I have seen the medical field start to change through the eyes of a good friend. She is a nurse and has seen the hospital bring robots in the OR. At the same time older doctors are phased out and much younger, cheaper doctors are brought in. She was talking to one of the reps and their goal within a decade is to have most procedures done robotically with a doctor or PA babysitting the process.
One of theses protests will catch him before he leaves or the wrong person will see hm walking down the street. He should be thinking about hiring some security.

I am an art director with about 10 years experience in design. A formal education is not necessary at all. I dropped out of art school and started working because I need the money and I have zero regrets. \n\nThe problem with a lot of schools is they are out of touch.

That is some truth right there.
Little embarrassed to admit it, but it took me over a year to get through it.
Do we want to be a society that motivates people to act on punishment or educated reason. Sure there will be people that reason may not work, in that case manipulation will work just fine. Threatening these people will push them farther away, indoctrination will work much better. Let's face it, these people are not very bright, which is an even easier group to manipulate.
Exactly

Not sure if you are familiar with Richard Dolan. He did a pretty decent take down of project blue beam, tracing back to a mega church in the 90s that said it would be used to trick them about the second coming. It doesn't rule out the tech that could be out there but it was interesting.
Am I the only one who doesn't want disclosure. This world is so chaotic I think most people would loose their shit unless it was slowly done over a generation or two.
I would argue that he did not win, Hilary lost and that is how he became POTUS.
Maybe that is goal. There seems to a strong desire to create chaos within his actions. 
So where does that stop? Mandatory flu shots because a person may come in contact with someone who is susceptible to death because of the flu? Vaccines are an essential part of a modern and concentrated society. There are better methods to achieve a higher adoption rate without incarceration.\n\nAlso proving that a person was directly responsible seems almost an impossible task in most cases. Think of the Disneyland breakout. In addition looking at my son's immunization record. Education is they key. I would start with religious leaders.
Yet, the goals f the document are being achieved.
I could kind of go along with this but his ego or need to feed his ego is fundamental to everything he does. Who gives a fuck if o e person showed up to the inauguration, it only mater who the president is right now. If he was truly brilliant it wouldn't even bother him. I just don't get it.\n\nAlso the Goldman Sachs ties killed it also. He seems to have drained the swamp so he could hire them. I was never really a fan, but I understand the want and desperate need for change. I hope you are right, but everything so far just looks like business as usual.  
It is a method of manipulation. 
I would also like to know what else the intel community is sitting on. Another good question is what does the CIA do if they know Trump is compromised but do t think a viable option is leaking the info to the press, because it may not change the situation.
No matter how bad you want to believe, that was not faked
He knows this. He also knows his base would defer their reality to him.
I doubt this will really hurt uber or the way you make money. Also I dint realize us assholes were responsible for your life choices that brought you to provide for them by working for uber.

Sure
What the fuck is wrong with you? Maybe try educating a little more aggressively, requiring vaccinations when attending any schooling or daycare, before we start locking people up. 
If you haven't listen to anything with Randal Carlson on his show, I highly recommend it.
I disagree. If you set up a series of workshops in larger cities teaching people the basics and selling plans, you would make money. On top of that you could partner with retailers so people can buy tools and other items they would need for a small percentage of the sales. In addition you film all of it and put it on YouTube with ads as a secondary passive stream of income. There is money to be made. \n\nWithin the workshops you would probably even come across one or two people who are the types who just want to pay someone 80k to make them a house and put it somewhere.
A few are turning around. My dad already has buyers remorse. Unfortunately some will just strap themselves to that sinking ship.

To be honest that sub has taken a weird and anti anything that is not pizza and pro Trump sense the election.
My completion had at least 3 points where I gave up. 
My point is, we did not expect it. Why would any country attack us in a convention way knowing our dominance. We would probably not know if China declared war on us until a week or two later.\n\nMy guess would be large scale hacking that would cause financial and infrastructure damage followed by destruction of a gps satellite or two. \n\nThe point is China is not stupid. Do not under estimate your enemy. Study history.   
The answer is C. None f the above.
I don't see how it does not end in a class war.

More than anything he needs to feel loved and admired. This can be seen in his weekly trips back to his country club, where this need is satisfied. If you think he is dangerous now, wait until the reality that the majority does not approve or like him is to large to be ignored with his alternative reality.
If he is smart he would keep a Great Wall between him and Trump, to maintain plausible deniability. Trump was not very smart in picking a VP that the GOP would be happy with as POTUS. This opens up a wi Dow for a GOP impeachment, a very small window,  but still a window.
The book is pretty dense and there is a lot in there. I find myself digging into certain parts over and over. For me I see it as a book I will be going back to for awhile. \n\nI haven't read the other title you mentioned, but if you have Spotify, you will find hours of his lectures there. It is really unbelievable the amount of material this one person created. 
Seems more like your arrogance. Anyone who doesn't like Trump or thinks he is just as shady as the rest is a liberal? The world is not that black and white. It is pretty easy to see his manipulations and motivations. \n\nThink for your fucking self.
No, you are the smart guy.

YES! Not me but my my wife.  Her Nmom is frequently "traveling" when she sleeps to other planes of existence and loves to tell my wife and her sister about how they will be safe when the world ends. \nFor years she told them that they were Indigo children and even told my sister in law that she is a "double Indigo." (Initially I thought this had to do with the Indigo Girls, but then I started making jokes about having webbed feet).  \nHaven't heard the Indigo thing for a few years, but we will all be together for the holidays and Nmom just attended a psychic fair so who knows. \nHad a great week so far hahah...sister in law was flying into town during snow storm and arriving very late, Nmom nervous starts drinking, my wife is at home napping and not responding to phone calls or texts (asleep), Nmom starts pounding shots because she thinks my wife has killed herself, Nmom falls down and almost breaks her shoulder (might have dislocated and popped back in honestly but she was to drunk to know for sure), and then says it was all because she was so worried about my wife hurting herself.  \nHolidays are gonna be lit.
Me too thanks.

Best shoes I have ever owned were Salomons. Put probably 1000 miles on them (not on the PCT, but on many trails).  Durable, comfortable for my wide hobbit feet, and those skinny slippy wire laces with the pull thingy made the shoe uniformly tight. Also pretty chic looking, not that it will matter in the desert.

Day of my wedding I was having brunch with the groomsmen and my dad, trying to energetically mix a Bloody Mary with the provided straw, clipped the edge of the glass and sent the whole drink into my lap and in between my legs so it soaked into my butt crack. If we had not been at a restaurant across the street from my apartment I would have walked out that door and never looked back. Rumor has it, I might still be walking.

they're evolving 
ive got a buddy whos a lift mechanic at vail. seems to enjoy it pretty well. everytime weve gone out there hes been able to meet up with us for an hour or so and do a few runs, thought that was pretty cool. 
same thing happened with violent crimes. rates have been on the decline, but reporting on it has gone up so the public view on it sees violent crime rates as going up. 
Also IIRC one of the girls used on epstiens island worked at Mar-a-Lago
im curious how you verified them being a shill?
yup, when they changed the algorithm a month or so back they made it so smaller subs can hit the front page easier. 
cool, thanks for the response. I havent watched SPR in a few years, gonna have to rewatch it soon and compare. 
check out the boot mechanic over by colorado mills mall. guys there were great, and they stood by their work. 
pretty sure this is how I would look if I tried to x-country 
fox news and breitbart for starters. 
one of my ex's showed me this before. can make some small boobs look pretty big and amazing. not saying small boobs look bad, but youd assume wearing 3-4 bras would look goofy as fuck. it doesnt, it looks great. 
A little different, but when we were young my brother and a few buddies had a get together. brother accidentally shot on of our buddies in the head wiht a pellet gun, so we called 911. The police/sheriffs showed up first and cleared the scene before the EMS would even come on the property. It was different because it had to do with with a gun being there, but it makes sense police would show up as well in emergency situations. 
montezuma bowl, pretty much most the backside
it was the same shit when he confirmed the flynn leaks in his tweet. people still tried to spin it as "fake".
guy i used to sell cars with is the same. Hes had his stache since at least Nam, hasnt shaved it once since. Hes joked about doing it a few times, we even brought a razor to work one day but he backed out. \n\nHe was also a fireman, so the stache is on point. 
yeah ive been to breck a few times since the accident happened and never had a liftie say anything. 
small town, police already knew we got in to trouble. police found pieces of plastic from his car at the crash site, it was the bright blue color, and pretty much knew which car it was right off the paint color. so they drove by and saw it all fucked up covered with a bed sheet in the driveway. 
uh, not sure why you say its relatively unknown in the states. Its widely used in the addiction community. 
huh, little late for them to speak up. 
oh for sure. I would wager CP arrests should be able to be looked up as well. 
for me, I want to ski back east. my dad grew up on wildcat and eventually taught freestyle and was on patrol, so ive always wanted to go back there and ski some of the same stuff he did. 
I took my top one out of my Sx120s for the first two weeks or so while I broke them in. Shouldnt have any issues taking just one out that i know of. 
god damn it. shut up
not sure if it has been used on opiates, but I remember years ago seeing a small documentary on something like this. Pretty much the Dr puts you to sleep, and induces withdrawals somehow, in a way that amplifies them and speeds up the process. So pretty much when you wake up the worst of the withdrawals are over with. Not sure how it worked or much else about it, but it seemed similar to what you were mentioning. 
thats where my buddy is kind of at now, hes been boarding out here in CO for a few years, but I moved out and started skiing with him. any sort of bumpy stuff or catwalk, traverse and such he doesnt enjoy so hes talked about getting in to skiing so he can keep up. \n\nside question, do you think being proficient in boarding helped getting in to skiing, with understand edges and carving and such?
haha A-basin has a vintage pair of these that look like theyre made out of wood boards in their rental office. 
here ya go\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_California,_2016
seemed to be that way. I skiied from about 4 til 14 or so, then got back in to skiing last season at 28. After a run or two on the bunny hill to feel things out it came back very quick. Honestly I was more nervous than I should have been. 
also can pull your stats on the epic pass app on mobile phones. I like the app a little better than the website. \n\nalso shows where you are on the mountain in the trail maps section as you move, which is cool for exploring. 
yeah but a Hellcat the engine is one of the main focus points, so it would be worth making it look nice and sexy like this. hiding and sort of wires they can. 
they are pretty great boots, loving mine so far. best of luck on the slopes. 
werent they speeding through a small road though, with incredibly old tires on the porsche?

I recently watched Hacksaw Ridge and was curious how the combat scenes compared in terms of realness. 
my old roommate and I got a cheap couch form a thrift store our first year in college. we had two cats who were sisters. a few weeks in to having the couch, we went out to run some errands. came back to two piles of shit on the couch, both cats had separately shit on the couch. so we decided to toss it cause it seemed like they didnt like the couch. 
yup, we did the state bid for ohio a few years back for the police chargers at our store. it really just came down to price. although they did get the hemi chargers crazy cheap. they were around 22,500 for a hemi, cant remember the price point for the v6's

awesome, yeah ill be there with him to help along the way as much as possible. thanks for the info. 
I remember an old screencap of some anime bulge someone ID'd. 
that would be correct. also vehicles as well. 
trump also stated himself how epstein enjoys his girls young as well. 
subs are horrible. as well as most the clinics that give them out. first one I went to they dont even ask what or how much you used, just take your cash and give everyone the same script for the month and send you on your way with no other help really. \n\nI was taking my prescirbed dose and lost 40 lbs in 3 months on them, couldnt eat or shit. Ended up checking in to a 30 day rehab and luckily ive been clean since. almost one 2 years now. \n\nIf you can get around using subs or methadone, please try. They just form another addiction. 
cant blame ya there then.
yup, brother had about 5k of work put in to his. stage 2 upgrades with the turbo toys and all that. next thing was a bigger turbo. he jumped over a two lane road, hit a tree and went through a fence and totaled his drunk though. \n\nhe drove it home and tried to cover it with a sheet and went to sleep. cops showed up a few hours later and arrested him.
haha I really want to learn this stuff, my dad used to be a freestyle coach out east during the 60s and 70s, he'd be so proud. 
it hasnt been too bad honestly. id def check it out, has loads of features in there. has snow conditions, lift wait times, a trail guide to plan out runs stuff like that. just the maps on there are great so you dont have to carry paper ones around at any of the mountains. 
outside of pricey food and lift tickets and such, theyve seemed pretty great so far honestly. havent had a bad issue on any of the mountains yet.

wouldnt really make sense for an rfid reader to have a light beam like that though. \n\njust looks like the bottom side of the scanners they put in random aisles so you can price check items. \n\nyou can see the roof above, so this light/scanner is facing down to the floor.

I don't care either way.  Defunding Planned Parenthood is bad though because it breaks the separation of church and state on a lot of levels.  It is imposing that belief on others who do not share when they believe life starts to have a right to live.  Is it conception? Or is it when they develop consciousness?  If I ejaculate, does that mean that I aborted my sperm by not placing it in a woman's vagina?  There is a big thick grey line from conception to birth as to when does the baby have the right to life.

(NSFW) Okay, so a few nights ago I have this weird dream where I was on a spaceship with this beautiful woman talking to me partially naked.  She shows me a group of men and women all masturbating like women including the guys.  I tell the lady that this does not make sense as men don't masturbate like that and that people don't dress like that.  She tells me this is my team.  It was weird too because there was a little girl doing kick flips in another room.  I try to get a little frisky and tell her that in our culture we get naked and make out at the end of every meeting.  I woke up right before.  Needless to say it was weird as hell and very lucid.  Normally my dreams are not that vivid or weird.  I may have been charged with some kind of purpose with aliens who do not know anything in depth about humans.

If Ukraine joined the EU with Crimea, there would be 3/5 countries controlling the trade which I think Russia seas as a threat.\n\nThere needs to be a trade deal that creates stability in the Black Sea to balance out the fear of losing trade influence in the Black Sea with Russia, Turkey, EU, Ukraine that allows the trade there to be balanced.  EU has a lot more leverage than Russia does with Turkey.  Likely, Russia fears this, too.  There needs to be trade agreements with EU and Russia to curb this civil war and returning Crimea to Ukraine.

Type something in a search engine or posted something on reddit and then deleted it or forgot about it.  I don't recommend typing an email or text though to a person as I have seen a dude actually send it.
That Nintendo brought out the Nintendo Classic and made it rare to spark interest in the Switch so people buy it.
Time.    It hurts more than anything. If they do not respect you enough to return your texts, then they are not worth your time and energy.  I have had this happen a lot with women that I was friends with.  They get a boyfriend and then they ghost me.  It sucks.  I have had to delete numbers from my phone because I wanted to contact them so bad.

Commercialization of Private Prisons.  The crime rates peaked right as private prisons gained dominance.  They pushed laws that prevented crime of future criminals.  
You are asking reddit.  Most will be lucky to even gat an online message back.
Time is a constant unit of measuring change.  It is manmade.  It's existence is like numbers, letters, grams, etc.  To go back in time is to reverse change in everything in the universe while you stay constant.
I grew up with two older sisters and my dad was disabled. I used to have feminine mannerisms due to this and was picked on because of it.
I spent 300 hours studying for a test and passing but no one would even give me a second look.  I left that career.  Looking back, I call it a waste as there is little application to what I learned.  I think it helped me connect a lot of dots though and point out corruption pretty easily.

Protect the decent livings of the people.  Most Skilled labor will likely be replaced by contracts from automated industries.  Things such as heart surgery, movie screenplays, TV shows, etc.  Hollywood could even have a fake celebrity that does not exist who is just CGI.  There was a script written by an AI that was bad and was produced a year or so ago.  C-level positions will exist but they will be about how connected you are or where you go to college.  What has happened to the meat industry where they simplified the workforce to the extent that workers have very little rights or say will likely be the future of the workforce due to replaceable labor.  People would be dependent on a handful of corporations for living.  This provides them less accountability to the public as well as more influence on government.
I don't. If they're brown, I go down. If they're black, go bareback.
One time in college I had a guy in my class that was pretty cool.  I invited him over to seriously play battletoads and other NES games on an original nintendo.  He was thinking he was going to get a little PM_ME in him.  I lost to some stupid AI and called it "GAY!" He was not pleased but left.  I regret that statement as it stemmed from my religious upbringing.\n\nI am cool with getting hit on.  It is a confidence boost as women have tons of dudes constantly approaching them so they rarely approach you.  I have had a few gay friends over the years and they are legit, really kind, and respect boundaries.

It didn't me.  He looked serious and pissed and it was more of a disapproval of either saying that or the fact that some people complained about it.  He did a bang up job with Force Awakens as I cannot imagine the amount of stress involved with headlining a rival franchise like star wars.  He was juggling Hasbro, Disney, Lucasfilm, star wars critics who will pick apart every detail (the most intense critics in existence).  The way he delivered that comment scared me shitless.

There is a % daily value of sugar that is not on any labels. I want to say it is about 50-60 grams per day. After that, the amount becomes toxic. Higher sugar makes your body store a larger % of what you consume. It ends up making it difficult to maintain a high sugar diet while counting calories as you body thinks it is eating less. 
Fake News creates the bias and allows someone to immediately discredit information.  A lot of it is biased because there are paid interest groups that support the news.  If people want news for the people, they need to crowd fund it.  It is important to do a side by side of opposing perspectives on a key viewpoint.  For example, claims that Trump not being able to read is a big stretch to even be news at all.  Media did not pick it up I think but it went the Facebook rounds.  That just makes democrats and anyone spreading that look bad.

Orgasmo is a great movie by Trey Parker.  It is about a Mormon Missionary that ends up in porn as the superhero Orgasmo.  There is no female nudity in a movie about porn.

Get as many women pregnant as possible.
There were a lot of minors and trafficing victims involved that time too, but yeah that is an important distinction.
If you look at previous years you will see it's common during superbowl. They arrested like 60 pimps the superbowl before this one too.
There are some elites in attendance?
What the hell is up with all of these trafficking busts centered around huge sporting events?? 
big sporting events have always been a magnet for the sex industry. Always a lot of drunk single  men willing to take risks . 
Define 'pimps'. Are we talking regular street pimps operating a stable of women who choose to be in the game? Or, are we talking about enslaved women/men owned and operated for prostitution via a handler or handlers? \n\nThere is a gigantic difference. These trafficking arrests, as far as I can tell via the reported events so far, are of the cookie cutter vanilla pimp/prostitute variety, where mainly just johns' are getting arrested. Those types of arrests don't even scratch the surface level of the depth of human trafficking we are discussing in this very subreddit.
It confuses me that they have a show about swimming pools. I've watched like 6 episodes, there was one koi pond with fish, other than that no animals. That being said that guy makes some cool ass swimming pools.
The whole movie appears to be on youtube lol. It's an odd movie. I remember seeing it when I was younger at the rental place and assuming it was some joe dirt ripoff. It's one of those movies that I rarely hear people say they have seen it if I ask, but I've never heard anyone who had seen it say they disliked it. 
I mean if it's because of his personal investments why did the previous presidents do the same thing? For example Obama helped the Saudis and bombed Somalia. I don't disagree that we will most likely continue or increase similar actions under Trump, but that reasoning confuses me.
So... Down to the brass tax Mr. President. Exactly how many goblins have you slain thus far?
I mean he isn't technically wrong? He said he was a black American not a Saudi middle Easterner. He didn't say he doesn't accept funding from them, or that he's not a muslim. I don't like supporting people who take money from Saudi Arabia though, and sourced rebuttals are very refreshing. I agree.
I believe the breaks are a set schedule. If you check the dates from last year I'm sure it's similar.
Until the next election in 2020. I don't like Trump at all but fuck. President Pence sounds far worse IMO. Fuck Pence.
This one goes pretty deep. Basically the main reason is the whole apocalypse.  A lot of these people actually want the apocalypse to happen. Israel has no where near the support from Jewish Americans as they do the Christians. Look into the neo-conservatives. Basically When George W Bush ran for the first time they were able to use pro-life, anti-gay marriage and things of that nature to appeal to Christians. The big thing though was "We gotta protect Israel, They're God's people!" Supposedly Dubya even told a French PM that he needed to go fight Gog and Magog (sp?) which he said was Russia and Iran. He was literally saying they were two countries from an obscure prophetic bible verse, not in Revalation. Pretty wild stuff really. 
Damn. Even CNN apologized for making this claim lol
I was expecting this for some reason. His is way better. https://youtu.be/r7ANZ8Osnz4
Why'd you ask the question if you knew the answer dick?! Haha no this is a conversation people never have that I feel is important. I was 12 during that first election. I was a Christian, baptized and all that. That election was terrifying. It was generally accepted that politics weren't sonething we got into in my rural baptist church. All of the sudden my preacher told the congregation to vote for Bush, and a deacon that I respected actually said in the closing prayer "Please touch people's hearts in America to vote for the right guy so he can bring us back to being a nation under god." My parents got mad at me for bringing up how inappropriate and disgusting that display was. I was against abortion, gay marriage, and the pot at the time for reference.  Indoctrination is real.

I see it now. Stuck on several sides.

It did tank the British Pound pretty hard, "Revotes" always seem fishy and hard to trust though, especially when the "Fuck You" vote is the one that won.
Everyone knows the robot mafia runs their unions. Common knowledge lol.
Now he's in prison for trying to steal his own shit back with a gun right? I never looked into it much but that was odd. I wonder what the whole story with that is.
Not just that. Obama irresponsibly moved 3,000 troops to the Russian border. Rachel Maddow went on tv saying it was good because if Trump removed them we would know he is being controlled by Putin lol. 
Probably. There was a post yesterday about him being a Russian spy.
Except that he regularly calls the DNC the other republicans, says he wishes the party was fixable but probably isn't,  and says we need a viable 3rd party.

God could you imagine the collective circle jerk CNN would have if he went to Russia. "See he worked for them the whole time! The stole Clinton's election!" I hate to say it, but him accepting asylum from Russia would have huge ramifications here stateside as well.

Lol not a fan of his but I want him at everything. "Mr. President, when are you going to expose the shapeshifting reptiles?" 
People talk about Epstein a lot. Trump supposedly raped a minor on his plane.
Ok. Apparently due to the fact he isn't a US citizen they would basically have to prove that he solicited/orchestrated the leaks IIRC. He would have had to approached someone, offered them money to obtain classified docs etc. If someone obtained leaks and then sold them to WL that's not a crime. Something like that. When he first made the offer they responded saying he wasn't technically charged with anything. Seems like they know there is no real case. An Australian can't commit treason against america.

One thing would be pointing out that even the US government doesn't blame the taliban. They blamed Bin Laden who isn't part of the Taliban.

Here is something interesting. Shows terror attack breakdowns in the US. Doesn't specify christianity but the KKK consider themselves to a Christian organization, and most recently you had Dylan Roof.

I like a lot of the ones already mentioned, but I felt like Guy Ritchie needed some love on this post. Lock stock, and snatch are fantastic. The sherlock holmes movies with Tony Stark were well-done.

I wasn't responding to op. I was responding to the guy I responded to. I fucked that up, my bad.  But here is a good one. I brought this up to my mom and she said "god must have known those kids were going to grow up to be bad people"  And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.\n

How were you not aware of this situation before putting it in the oven?
Ty. That beef is all still edible. 
Honestly, and you can tell your teacher that Pologrounds said this....how can a regular person on the freaking internet prove international human trafficking and organ harvesting by doing old fashioned journalism (going to interview people and sleuth for clues and pieces physically) beyond a reasonable doubt? Everything found online is going to be circumstantial evidence to your teacher. Have your teacher create a reddit account and engage us. I mean, this seemingly connects thousands of years of "elitist" mindsets and views on the very nature of power.\n\nHonestly, all of us critical thinkers are still in the stage your teacher describes, of carefully analyzing the supporting claims. Some of us are more vocal than others, just as some are more diligent than others. \n\nDoesn't George Webb list his source material in the description of his videos? 
Congrats on kicking opiates. All the best to you.
And those trillionaires aren't even the top level. For some reason, many people won't (or can't, whether told not to or just psychologically cannot handle going deeper) go beyond them in research.
You gotta really think about the Federal Reserve as just a bank that answers to the Bank For International Settlements. They want all of this turmoil between the Fed and the People so that the Fed can be purposefully sacrificed (like Lehman Brothers was in 2008) in favor of an IMF controlled nation. That's the big picture. What will replace the Fed? Whatever the globalists want, so long as people are still bound to the monetary system in existence.
Organized religion (specifically, the Vatican and Vatican Bank). And they have handlers as well. My guess is that their handlers delve into the inter-dimensional/metaphysical realm.
Anybody else find it odd that we have all of this talk about a wall being put up to separate Mexico from the U.S., yet the figurehead of the most powerful surface-level bank in the world is Mexican? Should that not raise an eyebrow or two?
No. But in a a connection of underground child trafficking, this could conceptually link the Penn State pedo ring to the US government via another guy who helped loot Haiti that just so happens to be the former first lady and Secretary of State's brother.
All the signs are there that he is (from his past....funded by Wilbur Ross and Rothschild Inc as a part of the Resorts International casino deals, and also having Soros invest in his Chicago building in 2004). His money is all over cabal interests. And with his cabinet picks, it just seems that he is definitely playing along with them (proposed travel ban on most of Wesley Clarke's '7 Nations in 5 Years' list, the proposed gutting of Dodd Frank regulations, etc.). Makes a person really wonder sometimes if there will ever be an uncorrupted leader.\n\nThere is no way of reform within this current monetary/economic governmental system. The only thing that will save us is for the disclosure thing to be real and truthful, an outright total governmental overthrow, or a mass awakening to a hogher consciousness.
Is there an active coup going on right now? Clinton/Obama, Paul Ryan & Co or the C I A / N S A / F B I?
All are solid questions. I'm interested in the answers to them as well.
Yes, it does look that way too.
This series is a geopolitical opus. Think the child trafficking through Malta has anything to do with the Pope's current strife with the Knights of Malta? Could be covering his (Bergoglio's) tracks.

My thought is that the US lost the battle to have the Qatar pipeline option to go through Syria, so this is now plan B or C (next to the Keystone/Dakota pipelines/Canadian Tar Sands redux)? Somalia offers decent explorative oil locations too, I believe. Maybe you take the oil from Sudan, transport it through Libya to shipping tanks in the Mediterranean? To me, everything else stems from oil interests and transport of goods. \n\nUltimately, if you destabilize Iran, then you mess up Russia's pipeline interests from Azerbaijan. It's been about oil control for around 150 years. You'd think people would get wise to the info out there after all these years.\n\n
It was a joke.
Yeah, I think you are probably right (about is being able to see its rotating planets before Nibiru itself).
Good news, yet still tiny in scope. \n\nAgain, more johns'. Low hanging fruit (if even hanging at all). What about who owns and operates the websites? What about who supplies the under age qids? 
Yeah, in that Joe Rogan/Alex Jones podcast, Jones touched a tiny bit on it. Definitely not enough though. \n\nThis is why secret societies/mystery schools exist and have levels/degrees. As you gain a higher degree, you have more access to the mysteries (which could be from Atlantean origin or even beyond that).\n
I was just looking to purchase his books today on Amazon. Good stuff.
Same on the East side. I live on South Street, which was the East River when Wall Street was a slave port. It was all water until you reached this place called Bridge Cafe, which was a brothel I think in the 1800's.
Haha yeah. That is the part where people say the Joe Rogan interview went "off the rails", but I thought he didn't delve into that stuff enough.
"B of A is not accused of any wrongdoing." \n\nThat right there sums up the state of our world right now.
Pretty much. I'm no fan of this garbage, but this is seeing the forest, not the trees. All of these moves are either for oil, or to stop other countries from making oil profits.

If you don't mind me asking, do you astrally project on the regular? I never have, and find it frustrating that I haven't and am stuck in this realm to just continue to ponder and doubt. Is the Aboriginal Australian and South American shamanic view of the 'dreamtime' just them travelling to the astral realm, outside of the simulation?\n\nI read a lot about the subject, but I also don't want to waste time while being led astray. Have any trustworthy works or accounts about this subject?
Hahaha, such a great comment. 
I've never heard that Jesuit 100 year prophecy to clean up their act sort-of thing to raise our consciousness. I've only heard of the Magnum Opus for the world, and to me it seems like we are still in the throws of the Kali Yuga.

I think he just has a Google docs link to his slides. You'd have to piece together the source info yourself on the specific points. But really, to just convince your one teacher, who seems to conduct himself in a Socratic dialogue type of way, it's probably not worth it. There are bigger things to research going forward than proofing and proving what's been uncovered already (in this subreddit alone the documented online evidence is pretty convincing) for a closed mind to see. Your teacher's idea of the justice system is idealistic and not realistic. Justice means 'Just Us', with 'Us' meaning the connected people, and not the layman.\nA peer-reviewed sourcing of things is a conceptual product of the system. Who's going to peer-review sociological and anthropological studies specific to organized pedophilia rings and human sacrifice in the modern age? It's a dangerous endeavor for certain, to where you have to provide proof-of-life videos daily if you even release your findings to the public (i.e. George Webb). \n\nHe's right on one thing though...."if you can't to some degree trust the scrutiny the topic has been given by law enforcement, judges, juries, trained journalists, aides, politicians, citizens, etc. who have been involved in the "pizzagate," then it's pretty hard to trust anyone in the world."\n\nThat is where a great majority of us are at. We cannot trust the scrutiny that many, if not all, topics are given by the conventional parties of authority.

Can we get a protest going for things like that in Washington, D.C.?! THOSE are the important issues. Imagine if all of the people in that womens' march had marched for free energy instead. Wouldn't that be something.
Absolutely.
I hate the use of that word, transparent, in the context of committees. More transparency so that the laundered money flows right into your coffers, huh Perez?
So Donald trump resigned? Gotta see it to believe it.
Private corporation conducts business as a DoD contractor, using taxpayer generated funds. Ain't life grand.
What kind of psy op? From the videos that I have seen (about 15 so far), the thought process is very logical and Webb seems genuine. He's pretty much just displaying open-sourced findings in a matter-of-fact way. Pretty much what I would do if I had any real technical slide creation skill.
Facts are strange things, huh?!
I'd argue that by the time I reach 59.5, there won't be anything left in my 401k. And, that is not from me spending it.
I watched a Super Bowl one year (think the Steelers vs. the Seahawks in 2006) at a Freemasonic lodge. I was invited by a friend of mine (middle-aged guy from my gym at the time), and I had brought a friend along as well. They tried to get me and my friend to commit to attending a meeting, but me and my friend respectfully declined. That was pretty much it. No real pressure, just a "hey, would you guys be interested?" sort of thing. Like anything, you either have a friend that could refer you or says you should join, or you can probably actively go to a place to inquire about membership.
So this is basically the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA) supercomputer from Eagle Eye? 
Good points.
Full moon on Saturday night, too. I distinctly noticed the moon last night as being very bright. I said to myself that it was "crisp out" in my region (New York).
All part of the illusion I guess.
My guess in this context is 'alien' meaning unknown, foreign.\n\nI think that you are right, about NATO/UN intervention. Also cannot rule out US opposition via the Arctic Council.
I don't know why George Webb would meet with Oliver Stone's people for a film project on this. So that Stone can whitewash it for the C I A?
I think that the pre-conditioning may have something to do with our understanding of time and space. The circle of time, as stated in The Hermetica. I think Interstellar delved into space-time being physically represented as a construct, and Arrival touched upon the access to past, present and future information without a linear time limitation.
Does anybody else see the geopolitical realism behind this move? Thwart Iran from building more oil pipelines to connect with Iraq->Syria->Turkey. Along the way, hinder Russia as well because they are aligned with Iran. \n\nMore people need to read Brzezinski....and I don't mean Mika.
Exactamundo
Most likely the latter. ET evidence (communicated via governments/mainstream media) would blow the lid off of the Abrahamic religions and leave those followers aimless. Right now I think those in government/religious power are still trying to find a way to communicate this info and not have chaos.
Yeah. I was just going off of the title of the thread. Didn't read the article. Nicely done.
Which star is that? HD 162826?
Ha that's what I thought too.
You hit the nail on the head there. We know about a lot of stuff, but do we really want to KILL another human being? No. That would actually damage us in our overall quest for truth in this life. You'd stoop to their level of psychopathy with that lone act.
I would venture a guess that it all went down after he met with Oliver Stone's people about a film adaptation of his research. 
Is your name actually Dan Bilzerian?
They are bankers for the Vatican/Holy Roman Empire. You are right though, their power and influence have ultimately waned over the past 300-500 years.
This is the smallest of potatoes.....trafficking of female prostitutes? Happens in every city and is the oldest profession in the world as we know it. What about the trafficking of children to elite ritual ceremonies for child sacrifice and child r a p e? That is the real crackdown, not this bread and circus massage parlor and backpage breakups.
That's why I'm so interested in the comic book character Magneto from X-Men.
And the Dallas shooting.....and the Orlando shooting....and the San Bernardino shooting....and the Oregon shooting.....
Is anybody actually feeling anything though? As in, physical or mental sensations they haven't felt before? I've felt nothing along the lines of a shift into another dimensional reality. I know a lot of the info, been researching for 5 years, but I've also been warned of the New Age farce during this period of awakening. That being kept in mind, I contemplate a lot, but don't feel a lot of effects.
It's Kevin Annett. While I believe he does good work in uncovering the trafficking going on in the US, Canada and Europe, I don't believe anyone will be put to trial. Especially by his tribunal. \nAnd the GCR is not for our benefit. It's a long control play by the "the cabal".
Obvious shill is obvious.
This sounds great. And with John Anthony West having cancer, this is a real gift to the public.
Banks are using blockchain technology too. They have planned a lot of this, so they are very hip to the tech (on some levels). 
Creepily poetic, isn't it?
I'm not sure. I have heard quite a bit of elites have property in New Zealand over the past few years. It just strikes me as Elysium for them. The US, with what I've read, will be a natural disasters zone in most of the country.
Definitely. It's weird. We want the truth to get out, but just want the raw truth. No manipulation.
Just because someone turns up doesn't mean they were never MIA. It actually lends credence to the assumption that he may be an asset of someone or some group.
This is a huge 'f- you' to the lower income and middle class workers of NYC. People have said it before, but this city is nickel and diming its patrons to death. How will this be implemented by cashiers at grocery stores? These policymakers need to come down from their penthouses and live like a common person for a week and see how their cash grabs affect people. Pretty soon we'll be paying for napkins at take-out places.\n\nAnd these canvas tote bag options.......give me a break. Do you think people (men especially) are going to carry around tote bags for groceries???? Whoever thought this policy up should be ashamed.....but they dgaf in all reality what we think.
Me too.
Thanks. That was a good book. Read it a couple of years ago.
For the Federal Reserve Bank of New York....I was walking around there last week. It's a fortress. And the streets in that part of Lower Manhattan (the old Dutch New Amsterdam) are incredibly narrow. Not much effective protesting would take place without a lot of police interference. Plus it is right across the street from Chase's lower Manhattan headquarters, so Mr. Rockefeller will prob have his Pinkertons' at-the-ready to quell anything.\n\nWhat will protesting the Fed really get you? An interest rate change? No. Either nothing will happen, or bad things will happen to people (on both sides).
The color, highlighting and font on that site make it awful to read and blatantly obvious to others what you are reading on a computer.
Yeah. I don't know who/what the Brotherhood is though, for sure. Could be extra-terrestrial, inter-dimensional, ancient hominid, breakaway civilization. So many possibilities.
Awesome, thanks. I personally own all except for Altered States and I Am More Than My Physical Body. \n\nHave only read Journeys Out of the Body so far. Have been reading a few books by the Dalai Lama of late, focusing on karma, samsara and reincarnation, oddly enough.
Define 'raise hell'? Destruction of property? You'll be dealing with the cops or the National Guard. We've already had a non violent protest movement in that area, with Occupy Wall Street, that hardly put a dent in life for the elite. I can't see a way that would truly hurt them, other than non-participation in the monetary system (which is incredibly difficult).
Wow. That is a real plot twist. Small freakin world for these sickos.
A lot will escape to New Zealand and elsewhere.
That was a good book. I'd have to read it again to grasp more of it. But basically, know thyself.
Thanks for the info.
Good to know. Maybe the stories in the past have been disinfo. Let's hope so.
Nobody knows anything about most of these appointments. It's just such a ish-show at this point.\n\nThey could take a CIA Operative fresh off the M K U ltra/Man churian Can di date assembly line and put on a military uniform and appoint him to a position and 98% of the country would not bat an eyelash.
It's got to be up to the individual to decipher truth from fear-mongering noise. I've swam deep into the conspiracy waters, and the reality is that you need to intuitively decide what you believe for yourself as the truth. A person that lets something like the karmic soul-trap/archon talk influence their decisions in terms of the quest to astrally project, needs to take responsibility for what they let into their focus. 
The thing is, they've created this reality that they are seemingly adapting to. You are probably right about where the future lies in finance.....more automation, leaning towards total automation (elimination of a physical need for monies). That puts the control of automated currency flow into the hands of a select few within a highly structured world (operationally, in the hands of Blankfein and Dimon).
Good, honest information. Thanks. I don't invest in anything other than my retirement plan, but I'm sure they bang me with the fees there as well. I too have gotten disgusted with the evolving practices throughout this century. 
Good stuff, thanks. Yeah, I believe I had read an earlier entry that looked like that a week or 2 ago. Would like to read out in public, but the visuals are too much to do it covertly.
They build you up, then they tear you down. The only question is when.
He had better not be one of the 19 that got an immunity deal, he needs to spend the rest of his life in jail. 
Thanks! But in all seriousness the reason why it looks that good is because of the chassis. Maxnet is the maker of the chassis and are designed for the cables to look like this. The only difficult part is cutting the mini coax to length for the bottom two ports on the 8 way splitters
I'm fairly sure wow or whoever owns the lawrence cable plant will not have 4k for quite a while. U-verse does not have 4k and will not, their best resolution is 1080i.

Would you want to go against your party and president 4 weeks into his presidency. Rubio may be spineless, but I believe he's just playing ball for the time being. Also, didnt President Trump temporarily stop all lobbying?
I don't see how 28 ghz, 37 ghz,  and 39 ghz can cause any cancer. It's not even remotely close to the microwave spectrum.

Id call in and register some kind of complaint about him. I'm sure the USPS vans have some sort of GPS tracking that they can pull to verify what had happened. Sounds like the person driving is completely unsafe.\n\nI'm assuming he was heading over to the USPS over off of vermont. Their number is (785) 843-1681 and give them the van number that is in the picture and tell them what had happened.\n\nBest of luck!
Your title suggests that they are going to indict him, but the article clearly states they they do not know if they are or not. Which makes me wonder if you just submitted the link without even reading the article or you just want to submit click bait garbage. 
Bought the butcher, still contemplating whether or not to get the Medford 
I'm so sick of people reading a title of an article which is obviously misleading and taking it for fact OR reading an image with white text on it and believing it like it was fact. People do not critically think anymore, they let anyone else tell them how they should think or feel about a certain thing. It's the hive mentality but the hive is mislead into thinking something wrong.

I'm confused what we're arguing about. Did you post this article with the title "Former Congressman Anthony Weiner to be Indicted for Child Porn"? 
I don't think so. He mentioned that his phone went from. 97% battery to dead. So he was recording on his phone and then would upload it. I hope he's alright. 
Maybe we can get a really tall water slide too
Yup and is in charge of Eric and Wendy Schmidt Foundation.  Since Clinton will not run for office anymore, no one is going to pay to play so they are moving from the east coast to the west. \n\nOne thing I don't understand is why did braverman say "follow the money"  and then disappear only to come back in charge of a different corrupt foundation.

I'm not sure how exactly it works, but I don't think it works as a blank get out of jail free card. The pardon only works against a specific conviction. So, I'm sure the pre-pardon would have to pardon her for a specific crime.

What a load of horseshit 
Like all those polls that said Hillary would win?
The Midwest is decimated by globalization. That's why Trump won. Keep calling cries for racism but every trump supporter I know voted to oust the establishment and being from Ohio many want the manufacturing sector to come back. Automation or not a factory just sitting on US soil pumps in huge amounts of tax revenue into the local economy. Many towns that lost factories are seriously hurting. Especially those in Ohio Michigan and Wisconsin.
States issue
Bush 41 was elected. Only ford has ever been appointed.
I would bet Nike overlords who love child labor demanded Lebron try to make Ohio go blue ( he campaigned here with Hillary the day before the election). 
Student here, not a shooter, used a car and machete. We must stop radical Islamic terrorism.
She visited Wisconsin literally 0 times.
Which is incredibly skewed because of the populations of New York California and Illinois. Democrats pretty much need to win the popular vote by 3% to win the general.
And the democrat campaign is built upon money from countries who stone women who are raped.
The election in general probably provided the most amount of red pills in history. And fake news just threw even more fuel in the fire.
This is the holier than thou attitude that drove voters to the polls in the first place. There are real reasons the working class rose up for Trump throughout the midwest and no it isn't because the midwest is just more racist than everybody else. 
Fire alarm pulled to draw out students. Car runs over crowd and get out and start hacking people. One professor got his leg sliced. Cop kills suspect within 1 minute. Other suspect currently contained in a parking garage. \n
Hmm, America must have just accidentally became the strongest nation ever to exist in the world...
Incumbents have an incredibly easier time getting elected.
The Eisenhower executive office building. It's holds the offices of the executive branch.
So was pretty much everyone with money. Nobody of the upper class fought in wars after world war 1. GWB had his daddy's connections put him in the air national guard with all the other rich kids. This isn't something that should surprise people.
Forget Columbus, any civilization that ever set sail knew the earth wasn't flat. It's very easy to observe the curvature of the earth on water.
Call it the Midwest Renaissance 
This is the thinking that put Trump in office. The rust belt put Trump in office alone, the 200 of the 700 counties voting Obama TWICE switched to Trump. It was an Economic decision
Congressional term limits
Because [four states shouldn't decide the election](http://michaelpramirez.com/uploads/3/4/9/8/34985326/mrz111916-color_orig.jpg).
Some reports a Somali refugee. Not surprised though Columbus has one of the highest populations of Somalis. 
No build the trains in the US.
Keep assuming 60 million people with real problems neglected by the Democratic Party are morons. The elitist attitude fuels every single Trump voter to vote Trump harder. 
Consumerism is good for the economy.
The places that used to have jobs and a manufacturing sector.
Somebody pulled a fire alarm to get a crowd of people outside the building.
Fuck the mainstream media and their collusion with the establishment politicians and shoving their narrative down American's throats while demonizing any other viewpoint.
SILENT MAJORITY RISES
You must suck at gambling 
The RNC fucking hated trump and wanted literally anyone else. Anything that came up would have been the same dirty tricks as the DNC, but thrown at trump and not sanders. 
Or the lefts blatant collusion and corruption.  
Kasich and Cruz publicly teamed up and told voters to vote certain ways in specific states to make sure trump wouldn't get nominated. If they did that in the open who knows that they were pulling behind the scenes.
Dude you're in the biggest metropolitan area along the border. No shit San Diego is going to have a better border than somewhere in the middle of Arizona. 
[of the 700 counties voting Obama twice, over 200 flipped to Trump. Of the 2200 counties that never supported Obama, 6 went to Clinton.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/obama-trump-counties/) 
Seems like everyone forgot when libtards were foaming at the mouth at the Iraq war cables from wikileaks
He literally gave a quarter billion to Palestine as he left office. 
An economy dependent on selling cheap shit to western countries is never going to economically lead the world. This is ridiculous 
Regardless, a factory sitting on US soil provides much more to the local community beyond number of jobs provided. The massive Chrysler plant shut down in my small town during the recession decreased total city tax revenue by more than 15%. 
So over 200 of the 700 counties that went obama twice then switched to trump are all racists?
This happened at Ohio university, not ohio state university.
The term was hijacked by the right after the pizzagate fiasco made the media blow their load
Most of the fighting was 63-75 when LBJ escalated the war. 
Sessions is being painted as the boogieman by democrats because he wants to prosecute pizzagate when he gets officially sworn in. 
Almost every race after the Iowa caucus was only 3 or 4 candidates. It was Cruz and Kasich for most of the race.
So did Obama in February of 09. It's pretty common so take your narrative elsewhere.
Not being Cuba
lol I voted for him because he was a better candidate than Clinton.
Do you realize there were many many MANY counties that voted Obama twice and switched to Trump? 
Only in certain areas where it doesn't make sense or it isn't logistically possible to have a wall. 
A factory on US soil goes a lot farther than number of jobs. Ever hear of tax revenue? A Chrysler plant that shut down during the recession cut my small towns tax revenue by more than 15%. Automation or not the tax dollars pumped into the local economy is still very important.
TIL republicans want to suspend the rights of women.
Trump knows
Then why are economists referring to the post recession period as "The Great Crawl"? unemployment is a terrible metric because it doesn't count those discouraged from even looking for a job. The jobs being added are part time and the median income has been steadily falling for decades.
I'd rather try and flip the current establishment on its head and try something new than have had Hillary sell out every piece of American she could to foreign donors to her foundation. 
Because then those states would have too much sway in the election whereas the government is suppose to be equally representative of every state. 
Rigged the primary by 4 million votes. 
I voted for him in the primary lol but you can rationalize my support for him anyway you'd like.
I'd bet many middle easterners wouldn't dare to even admit that if they were. Being Christian is bad enough
The US spends more per capita on healthcare than every other country in the world.
DEUS VULT
There is no way to do that unless the 50 states are divided. So Long as 330 million people are buying a ton of shit they don't need the economy will continue to roll. 
Somali born refugee. You tell me
Right because South Chicago, Oakland, East Cleveland, Baltimore, Detroit, and St. Louis are totally prospering right now.
Lol trump isn't defending against a mongol invasion we want to keep out traffickers 
The deep state is at war with Trump and the MSM is part of that deep state. Any true supporter knows that from the beginning the establishment is out to stop Trump and the election isn't going to change that. When the media starts saying all independent journalists that are not part of their team is "fake news" you can see why so many people have become speculative of the news being manufactured and forced down everybody's throat. 
The thing is because of Trump me a lot of others have begun to see through blue church and are now "awake". Many here don't like Trump which I get but because of him many more people are aware of what's going on.

It's proved in the 100% factual Wikileaks.

Keep it up, if this moral superiority doesn't go away you better believe the Trump crowd will continue to grow.

Or the media is being revealed as the propaganda they are and people are realizing they've been living in 1984. Anybody paying the slightest attention knows full damned well the propaganda machine is turned and pointed at Trump and his supporters.
Ali Muhammad, ding ding ding
This is the best meme. #fakenews
Yeah because California New York and Illinois shouldn't decide the election. Besides, it it WERE a popular vote wouldn't you think there would many many more republicans coming out to vote in these areas as they don't have any incentive to vote in a state that won't turn red?
Eh the US is sitting on a gold mine of natural gas. I expect the Trump administration to fully utilize the potential of shale gas which will absolutely boost the Midwest economy.

Rene Descartes called the pineal gland the seat where the mind meets the soul. Most people's are calcified by processed foods and fluoride but it can be opened up largely through meditation. It's the sixth of the seven chakras and it commonly called the "third eye". An open third eye means a very high sense of self awareness and intuition. Some people can even see human auras and other spiritual things normal eyesight cannot see. The conspiracy is the powers that be have tried everything to shut down the third eye to keep global consciousness down. When people are not aware of the "true" universe the third eye opens them to they are much more susceptible to the brainwashing carried out in our everyday lives.
