, at least not when it seemed like you hadn't read my post.
Thanks for the insight, but the Green Party will never have a chance. I don't care if they get to debate. They are far too extreme, and Stein is just kind of silly. Plus, the idea that she wouldn't become a corporatist is kind of unlikely. She called a recount to make money. 
 But many hillary supporters did the same. I was called sexist for supporting Bernie. 
Nor should they, because you are shit. 
Who's getting things done? The Dems lost big time in 2016. They've lost way more than they've won lately. People want real change. That's valid. And the fact is we need them. The Democratic Party isn't just Hillary Clinton, Joe manchin, and you. 
I see this, but we also have to balance it with genuine haste. People need to know how critical it is. Cutting down on plastic bags is great, but it's not going to do much to actually fix the larger problems. 
Thanks.
Yes, I very much was.
Howard, the oldest HBCU, was created by a white guy. \n\nBlack people didn't have a choice. It was Howard, and then a few other HBCUs. They weren't representations of choice. They were representations of necessity. Hence why people who are actually  informed on the topic or members of the schools took issue. 
Didn't watch the video huh? Typical. Willful ignorance. Just absorb whatever nonsense trump spews like a good little cultist. \n\nHe's a former CIA agent, and a true conservative, who knows more about and has done more for this county than Donald Trump ever has or ever will. 
Oh boy. \n\n1) There are already plenty of walls or other barriers. \n\n2) Many places cannot have a wall on account of it being water or mountain. \n\n3) Texas lawmakers generally don't want a wall because they know it will hurt more than it helps:http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/26/lawmakers-trump-mexico-tax-plan-would-hurt-texas/97120400/\n\n4) It won't actually stop much immigration on account of most immigrants not just running across the border like Trump says. Not to mention tat immigration is down and Obama deported more people than any other president in history\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/20/number-of-illegals-levels-off-fewer-crossing-mexic/\n\n5) You really want a tax increase for an ugly wall that won't actually do what you want it to do?
So then quit acting so high and mighty when you aren't even willing to back up your own points. Can't even provide a link?
Only 12 democrats chose to not vote, or vote for Stein?
He answered it on a false premise. I never said I wouldn't disagree with answers. That's what a discussion is for. \n\nAlso: I NEVER NAMECALLED.
Fuck em. Hope they go out of business: 
A doctorate in sociology isn't an easy degree that anyone can obtain. You picked it to fit your narrative. \n\nThe better thing to do is look at the average of all graduates, and the evidence is clear. You make more money the more education you have.\n\nPlus, your implication that poor people can't get anything but a sociology degree is fucking nonsensical and shows how out of touch you really are with this stuff. Just stop.
No. 
Yes, because GOP politicians have done a great job of attracting the votes of poor African Americans! Cutting welfare, cutting education funding, saying HBCU's are examples of school choice when it was really necessity because they weren't allowed to go to other colleges, Trump saying "what have you got to lose" and talking about how everyone gets shot as soon as they walk outside in Chicago.\n\nYou have no evidence of Democrats ruining the city. Cities only have so much control over their problems. If everyone listened to those socialist professors and activists, we could actually make a dent in poverty and racism.
Reagan increased it by over 100%. You feel the same about him?
No it doesn't. It shows that 46 out of 3.3 million were threats. \n\nI already showed you the white christians and you ignored it. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kansas-bar-shooter-adam-purinton-killed-two-iranians-indian-olathe-henry-county-911-court-a7603751.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylann_Roof\n\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/11/planned-parenthood-shooter-happy-his-attack/32579921/\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/30/at-least-five-killed-in-shooting-at-quebec-city-mosque.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html?_r=0
She was investigated over and over for years, by Republicans. Nothing. \n\nWe just want there to be an actual investigation into this.
So in other words you don't want unification, and don't actually care about 2018? 
Didn't you just say it was economic not safety? But then you invoke safe South American or African countries? Those places are 1) not as economically sound and 2) not as big. That shouldn't answer your question. 
Why is this even a thing?
Is this supposed to insinuate Strange was overrated? I haven't seen it. 
I think there are some nice ideas to play with, but what stuck out unfortunately were some of the issues. For one, there are some typos and grammar errors that can take a reader out of it very easily. Be careful of those. There are also some parts that feel a bit wordy (scene description) or unnatural (dialogue). Remember that you aren't looking to be poetic in your scene description. You just want it to be very clear. 
I think seeing him in 30-90 second segments spread out over a 2 hour film did him a disservice. That combined with bad writing makes it almost impossible to judge him. 
Yeah, that's stupid. 
Nah, I'll ask the person who made the claim.
That's the starting salary. You can't just look at that and ignore the average. \n\nPlus, you randomly chose a doctorate in sociology, which is not what most people would get. It's just the only way you have any argument, find the most extreme example and ignore the rest: http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/09/08/college_graduate_vs_high_school_graduate_salaries.html\n\nYou make way more money on average with a degree than without. And the more education you get, the more money you make. \n\nI didn't say education could solve poverty by itself. But it would help. You are flat wrong on this. Sorry.
Correlation doesn't equal causation. We know spring training record is meaningless. 
This is a great point.

You are just making shit up over and over. How the hell would you know? 
A wall won't help. \n\nhttp://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/01/trumps-border-wall-attacks-the-wrong-immigration-crisis-000286\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/us/donald-trump-wall-immigration-ranchers.html\n\nNot to mention immigration is actually down, especially in terms of people just crossing the border.\n\nWalls have never worked. The Great Wall was a failure. China was still invaded. Conservative God-King Ronald Reagan is best known for tearing down a wall, not building one. \n\nWe can't afford to fucking feed people in poverty but we can spend $20 billion on a slab of concrete that won't even solve the problem. 
Not how it works. 
No. The commander in chief is a civilian. 
They are losing at every level. House, Senate, Governor, local, and of course President. They may have picked a few up, but not nearly enough.\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/27/democrats-lost-over-1000-seats-under-obama.html\n\n(I know, Fox News, but it's accurate).\n\nAlso, insults and division? You are the one doing that kind of stuff. I'm trying to have a discussion. You are saying we should just ignore a large chunk of the party. That's not a viable strategy. 
I don't know how I feel about us having so many players in the WBC.
Thanks, I'll check it out when I can. Appreciate it.
Gambino is so damn good. This thread could just be his lyrics exclusively. 
Is context allowed? Like can the Flynn situation be brought up to show that "hey, this is kind of fishy, maybe its not just an isolated incident"? \n
Self gerrymandered? You mean the right purposefully did it and continue to get away with it?
How long is it?
This is all we have? What? There's a new scandal every day. Trump's approval ratings are the worst of any new president in modern history. He already lost the popular vote. There are protests constantly. \n\nBut yeah, Pence's emails are all we have. Lol. You are scared, it's obvious. 
On Ellen he said it's important that the government and the press have a "symbiotic relationship" and basically everyone laughed because Bush isn't known for his vocabulary. He then replied "don't ask me to spell that." 
Some would say 'kekistocracy'.
Is it bad that I knew what "Kakistocracy" meant because I watched "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"?  Kakistos, the vampire so old that his hands and feet are cloven, whose name means "the worst of the worst."
>So you're too illiterate to understand what I said and too stupid to understand what odds are?\n\nProbably both of I'm being honest.\n\n>The fact that she didn't win doesn't change the fact that she had a better chance of winning than Bernie Sanders. \n\nBut odds are only one piece of the puzzle. Bernie was far and away the better candidate. Looking back, I'd wish we'd gone with the long shot who actually matches my values than the "sure-fire" candidate who I'd have to fight against half of her agenda. \n\nAnd that's if I even accept the "she had a better chance of winning" narrative. Almost all polls had Sanders performing better than Clinton against Trump 
Should that be Kakastocracy? Government by shitty people. 
are you being serious? 
for all her victories, progress sure has some astounding defeats.
> When I heard Bannon say that every single member of the cabinet, with the exception maybe of Mattis and Shulkin, was chosen because that was what they wanted to do.\n\nI would love to get a source on this.  I've had my suspicions, but if he just came right out and said it, then this is terrible!
> I feel the same, but more of my anger is directed towards those that supported Hillary during the primaries because I feel like they at least had SOME of the tools required to make the right decision.\n\nAnd we did: we supported Hillary.  The only *true* progressive in the Democratic primary, and the only *true* progressive with a non-zero chance of winning in November.
I feel the same, but more of my anger is directed towards those that supported Hillary during the primaries because I feel like they at least had SOME of the tools required to make the right decision. Yes, half of the population is at least two of the following: stupid, irrational and  uniformed, but even more scary, another 25% are at least one of those things too.\n\nLiberals have just as much of a hand in this as conservatives as they consistently support centrist capitalists that do little to help (only when contrasted with neocons do they look decent) and then liberals wonder why conservatives hate them so.\n\nUntil they start putting up true progressives, they're going to suffer right along with conservatives.
So you're too illiterate to understand what I said and too stupid to understand what odds are?\n\nThe fact that she didn't win doesn't change the fact that she had a better chance of winning than Bernie Sanders.
>And we did: we supported Hillary.\n\nSMH... this is why we can't have nice things...\n\nShe's a neo-liberal centrist that supports global trade deals, doesn't support a carbon tax and free access to healthcare or public college.\n\n>and the only true progressive with a non-zero chance of winning in November.\n\nVirtually every poll showed Bernie performing better against every candidate and beating Trump by large margins (at one point, she was actually losing to Marco Rubio).\n\nMoreover, this is the problem right here. Within your own rhetoric, you're betraying the fact that you've settled. It's not that she was the better progressive, it was that you thought she was the safer bet (how did that work out for you btw?). We need to put up candidates people are excited for, not shoot ourselves in the foot before we even get to the real fight by keeping our best players on the bench in the name of playing it safe.
"I like how that lying, xenophobic, authoritarian sociopath seems to take charge. That's president material."\n\nYou know, after the election [I tried really hard to understand the Trump voter's point of view.](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/) I tried to empathize with the frustrations many in this country feel. Rather than work for solutions or understand the problems or do any research whatsoever, they elected the worst scum that's ever occupied the oval office. And to this day they defend his fascist, juvenile, and bigoted ways. They regurgitate propaganda talking points and remain uninformed yet cocksure. His supporters whom I have encountered tend to be walking, talking [dunning-krueger effects.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)\n\nI'm done trying to understand and reason with those who don't care to understand anything beyond what their cognitive dissonance allows. They represent the lowest common denominator of our country and they will be the ones who shall suffer the worst when the social safety nets are removed.\n\nWhere I'm at now, if so many want to burn the house we live in to the ground, I'll bring marshmallows and gleefully await the comeuppance that follows hubris. Tomorrow we shall all be the subjects of schadenfreude.
Haha
It was when he was at CPAC a couple days ago. He was very confrontational and confident. He was out front saying that he wanted to tear down our current system of govenment. Basically he was saying that they are going to keep escalating and expect to be constantly at war with the media. More and more this guy sounds like he just wants to watch the world burn. Scary dude. \n\nI'm trying to remember the source. I get a bunch of feeds so I'll go looking. 
Agreed. Also, I think this is the first time in the history of the Republic that the people who have been appointed to direct the country have joyously admitted to having their sole purpose in dismantling the government. When I heard Bannon say that every single member of the cabinet, with the exception maybe of Mattis and Shulkin, was chosen because that was what they wanted to do. My heart sank, my jaw dropped, and I just sat there like I was watching a massive disaster that I could do nothing to change unfold.                                                                              \n\nThat's is beyond appalling. I think I'm still in shock. I'm not sure I've ever felt so helpless since I watched 9/11 happen. \n\nI kind of agree with you that we should maybe sit back, not that we have a lot of choice, and watch them get their comeuppance, but the potential damage might be enough to turn a world power into a banana republic. The problem is we're all stuck with the results of their utterly misguided experiment in how not to run a government.  
This will be a kakistocatastrophe, regardless of what the spell-checker says.
>the only *true* progressive with a non-zero chance of winning in November. \n\nI don't want to relitigate the election, but you can't keep using "we picked her because she'll win" argument when you didn't fucking win. 
I'm confused by the allegation that Bernie wasn't progressive. \n\nI won't comment on chances to win the general but c'mon. 
[This is it, I think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/23/bannon-trump-administration-is-in-unending-battle-for-deconstruction-of-the-administrative-state/?utm_term=.3c564cc6fde5&wpisrc=nl_evening&wpmm=1)
> Bernie was far and away the better candidate.\n\nExcept in the real world, where he was the exact opposite.  He was a complete bumbling fool who had no clue how to actually get anything of substance done.  He was able to get elected as a Senator from lily-white, moderately-rural Vermont because getting elected in a state like Vermont doesn't require building coalitions among diverse groups of people with often orthogonal interests.  All he had was a stump speech full of grand ideas but with no specifics on how to get them done, and a complete insensitivity to the concerns of anyone who wasn't a straight upper-middle-class white person.\n\n> Looking back, I'd wish we'd gone with the long shot who actually matches my values than the "sure-fire" candidate who I'd have to fight against half of her agenda. \n\nIf you were a sensible person with a reality-based approach to making things happen, you'd prefer a decent shot of getting some of what you want to a guarantee that you won't get anything. \n\nThis is the real world, where not everyone agrees with you on everything.  So if you demand everything you want right now, you're guaranteed to get jack shit.  But if you're willing to settle for some now, you might be able to build a coalition to get that, and then you can keep up the fight for more later on.  All you're compromising there is the time frame, not the values.\n\n> Almost all polls had Sanders performing better than Clinton against Trump \n\nThere's a reason no one with a functioning brain takes those polls seriously: because the GOP hate machine hadn't yet been turned against Bernie Sanders, whereas it had been against Clinton for a quarter century.  But if he were the nominee?  You can bet they'd pull out all the stops against someone who (incorrectly) refers to himself as a "socialist."\n\nI mean, for fuck's sake: if he's too left-wing to win among just Democrats, he's sure as shit too left-wing to win across the entire country.  I say that as someone who's way to the left of him, probably way to the left of you too--I simply have no illusions about how far out of the mainstream I am, or of what is and is not politically feasible at the present time.
On the other hand, he also granted waivers to banks like Credit Suisse after they pled guilty to violating US law, and allowed them to keep collecting fees on workers pensions. He also vehemently supported the TPP even after Clinton and various unions came out against it.\n\nLet's not forget that the fact that the DNC voted not to reinstate Obama's lobbyist ban.\n\nSure, Perez is as economically progressive as he can be without getting the corporate donors angry.
Hawkeye. He's more paramilitary in training than enthusiast. Not to mention, in some continuities, his accuracy is literally displayed as a superpower.

I always hated Wolverine's mask. My favorite is Ultimate II, definitely. It pays homage to the previous designs, looks like a uniform, is practical, and ditches that mask.

Dude, I, and other people like me, are concerned about the direction of the party. But if you're just going to $#¡† on our concern, then there's no point in talking. I'm upset about what looks like the party shitting on a whole wing again. It may look different from your perspective. But if the party is split we won't win in 2018 and 2020. It's important for the winners to try to bring the losers in.  But accusing the losers of being babies and throwing a tantrum doesn't help anyone. I'm sorry there's so much hate in you. Just know that I don't think less of you.
I'm going to watch the ƒυ¢₭ out of this.
Swerving left to make a right. Unless you're driving a semi-truck, a trailer, or there is an impossibly right curve, swerving in one direction to turn another is a horrible habit and makes me think you're a terrible driver.

Thank you!
Okay, first of all, I'm trying to have a polite discourse with you. Let's try to be civil here, okay?  I'm not insulting people I disagree with.\n\n>Yes, and that is stupid.\n\nWe're not getting anywhere calling people stupid.  How about instead of saying "look at Clinton's career and see she's for everything you want," ask "what about Clinton makes you think she's not in favor of what you want?"  Beating people over the head with "you're wrong," fixes nothing.\n\nIf a Sanders fan says "I see other positions of hers line up with the interests of her donors; so I think that she'll do whatever her donors want, and I don't think her donors want an increase in the minimum wage." Your response shouldn't be "your stupid for thinking that."  It should be "okay, how can we fix that problem; what can she do to prove to you she is on your side on this issue."\n\nLet's work together.\n\nBut this goes both ways too. Sanders fans need to look to Clinton supporters and say "maybe we are moving too fast. What's a pace you're more comfortable with, and how can we meet in the middle."
How are we unifying?  This was a spit in the face to Half the party. Keith winning would've been a symbolic victory to half the party that's currently feeling marginalized. The DNC pretty much just said ƒυ¢₭ you to the progressive wing.
Can you give me a source?  Maybe I have it wrong.
How about someone who is progressive economically?  Not pro-TPP, and pro-big bank?  
That's true. But that doesn't mean the Democrats don't have to work to win back Sanders voters. Trying to win on "the Republicans are worse" didn't work in 2016.
See [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/5vyb3b/comment/de6qowr?st=IZKQBUJ6&sh=cf7ba3b3).
I respect your decision to bow out. This thread isn't entirely what I intended. There seem to be a lot of people here more focused on attacking and less focused on working together.  That being said, if you find the time, I'd appreciate a reply to my previous [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/5vyb3b/comment/de64wh5?st=IZKCQGQV&sh=4a67fb85). I am interested in bringing this party together, and I really would like your advice.
While I agree in principle, not everyone can get behind the "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" mentality. We need to at least address some ideological differences amongst the left, or there won't be enough of us to stand together to fight the fascists.  Can we solve all of our problems? No. Can we address some of them an start working toward fixing them? Yes. Maybe just addressing them will help unify the party. But, just saying we have to unify to stop Trump won't do it.
A group of twinks should be called a "cha-cha."
Honestly, no.  But, compared to Trump even Ted Cruz is sane.  The problem is, if you use the logic that no Republican is ever sane, then Democrats can keep using the argument "vote for us or else," forever.  Meaning, they can move as far right-wing as they want, as long as they stay every-so-slightly left of the Republicans.
Those are the major policy points of the Bernie wing of the party. We are for economic justice. We want to see the gap between the rich and the poor close. We want to see big banks who use unfair labor practices receive punishment. We see how many Scandinavian countries bounced back more quickly after the recession than the rest of the world in part because they treated the CEOs of banks like the criminals they were and jailed them.\n\nYet, at the same time, we see politicians taking money from big industry lobbies and then "coincidentally" siding with those industries in important votes. We see the DNC, just yesterday, refusing to reinstate the ban on lobbying donations put in place by Obama.\n\nAll sides of the party agree on social issues, but there is a divide on economic issues, clearly. When these economic policies are so important to me and other people in my wing, why should we be happy about the direction the party is going?  Why should we support the party who doesn't support what we're pushing for?
Most of my books for this semester are at school. And my school is one of the few that does Constitutional Law in the 1st Semester of 2L year (for some reason I don't understand).
Please, if anything it's becoming a three-party system. The Democrats have clearly split into two camps. Meanwhile the Republicans will stand behind one another no matter what.
I'd like to be more active.  However, as a law student who spends all his time either in class, interning, or studying, I find it insanely difficult. (However, I will be working for a heavily Democratic firm over the summer, so that may afford me some opportunity.)\n\nPerez is not as progressive as I'd like on economic issues, though. He supported the TPP, he let banks get away with mistreating workers, and he's not exactly opposed to corporate money infecting the party. And we have yet to see that Ellison's position is anything other than a powerless title.
Why doesn't the Bernie wing create their own truthful version of CTR?  We need that. Unfortunately, CTR is just too loud.
Time will tell.  I'm not giving the DNC the benefit of the doubt.
That's true. That's very true. I am in agreement. But that doesn't counteract the fact that some "Progressives" (read: the JusticeDemocrats subreddit) are vehemently anti-feminist and think that BLM is "racist."
While your at it, investigate whether the democratic primary was rigged.
People who can't say everything in one text.  I'm doing $#¡† on my phone.

Don't listen to that guy. Look at his comment history. He literally believes that Sanders and his supporters are misogynists. He's the worst of the CTR crowd.
I'm really getting tired of this "Perez is very progressive" argument. That doesn't pacify me. Someone can be socially progressive without being economically progressive. If an article said "Perez is very *economically* progressive," maybe I'd be a little happier. Right now it just seems like they're trying to artfully lie to us about Perez's populist bonafides.
People who say, "we need to talk later."\n\nWow!  That doesn't get my anxiety going! /s\n\nJust tell me what you want. Don't make me needlessly worry that grandma died for hours only to discover that the "talk" you were speaking of involved asking me if I wanted chicken or fish at the party. L
What would the Democratic Party care about the internal politics of the RNC?  Democrats are legitimately concerned that their primary was rigged.  American people are legitimately concerned that their election was rigged.  Hence the Democrats need to investigate their own primary as much as the American people need to investigate their own election.  Do you not agree?
I never said that. Is that CTR's new tactic?  Making up quotes. \n\nEDIT: When did I even imply that?  Seriously?  I said that if Perez wants to look into whether or not the general election is rigged then he shouldn't be hypocritical and look into whether his own party's primary was rigged too.

But I call him out on it and say we need to work together, and that gets downvoted?  This is why there's a split in the party!  People don't respect one another.  I may disagree with the other side, but I respect them.  But, if I can't get respect in return, I don't know why I even bother trying.
Wow!  There are so many downvotes to comments in this thread. But no real negative comments. It makes me think that simply saying anything along the lines of "I feel disillusioned," or "I'm not happy with this turn of events," or "I don't agree that we're all united," really pisses people off. Note to the downvoters: you're pushing people away from the party by dismissing their opinions instead of listening to them. If you want to come together, you have to actually try to understand the other side.
The worst are the people on r/BlueMidterm2018 . Just try to mention how our side of the isle is being fucked over, and they say "[bye Felicia](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/5w60yf/comment/de7q84u?st=IZMX9ETG&sh=e31cbfbf)."
I'm sorry, the "Sunnydale Slayers"?  It's the Sunnydale Razorbacks. And it will always be the Sunnydale Razorbacks!
That's quite a stretch, but okay. I'm guessing the album has more to do with misinformation, truth and epistemology in general.
I was maybe about 16 or so, and buying a new pair of pants at a department store. I went to go get changed in the changing area and (as a boy) was shocked to see a woman in there. The woman was sitting on a bench in a changing stall next to her daughter - who looked to be about 12 - across from her son, who was standing, and about 8-years old.\n\nThe mother was telling her son to get changed and try on his new pants. But the boy is resisting. He doesn't want his mother or sister watching him get changed.\n\nHis mother kept on saying, in a happy almost mocking tone that "no one cares."\n\nThe boy was bargaining with his mother, saying that his sister should leave, at least. Or, at the very least that she shouldn't look at him while he changed.\n\nThe mother though said it was no big deal.\n\nThe boy was on the verge of tears in embarrassment. His sister watched him change with a smile on her face. The mother laughed. And they did this all with the ƒυ¢₭¡И₲ stall door open!\n\nI only caught glimpses of what was happening as I walked by on my way in and way out of the changing area. And I could clearly hear their conversation while I changed.\n\nI wish I had done something, but as a kid myself, I didn't know what to do.
This is a tough one. On one hand (despite one of his powers literally being the "Wisdom of Solomon") Captain Marvel is often portrayed as having the intelligence of a child. This puts him at a clear disadvantage.\n\nOn the other hand, his power is legitimately mystical, which gives him a slight edge.\n\nNow, on the other hand, Wonder Man has invulnerability as a power, and has some other extreme abilities (including an ionic form).  That would normally give him an edge. \n\nHowever, Wonder Man (quite famously) died. Captain Marvel (to the best of my knowledge) has not died.\n\nThis is a close one, but I'm giving it to Billy Batson…but just barely. Mainly because he hasn't died (yet) and because who's to say that sciencey-powers will even affect his mystical abilities.
Unfortunately, the DNC apparently doesn't feel the same way.  If they were going full out to defeat the Republicans, they'd be bending over backwards to win back the Bernie-supporters.  Clearly, though, they're doing as little as possible and hoping that the Sanders-wing will fall in line because the Republicans are worse.  And that strategy may work short term, but in the long run, that will only anger the Sanders-wing.  Sure, that may win the election for them in 2020, but the second a sane Republican is running, the DNC will be out of luck again unless they make some substantive policy changes regarding money in politics.
We're holding out to see how the vote goes. Sure, maybe a few of the Democrats who voted "no" before will vote "yes" now. But if it's orchestrated so it still doesn't pass, then we'll likely assume that this was all just a show so a few Democrats could look good without actually passing a bill that doesn't benefit corporations.
The thing is, Justice Democrats was heavily supported by this YouTube anti-feminist called Sargon of Akkad. So many of his followed frequent the sub. Hence the strong anti-feminist vibes it gives off.
>The Clinton side just didn't think it should happen that fast or it may fail altogether. See, it's practical, not pie in the sky.\n\nTo respond to that, the Bernie side didn't expect $15 minimum wage if Bernie won. That's a myth that needs to be dispelled.\n\nThe Bernie side just wanted a politician that would try.\n\nMaybe, had Bernie won, he would've fought for $15 and compromised on $12.\n\nMaybe Clinton would've fought for $12, and compromised on $9.\n\nBut many Sanders supporters didn't trust that Clinton would even fight for that. They saw her speech transcripts, her former support of the TPP, her changing opinion on gay marriage, her support of fracking, and thought that she didn't have their interests at heart. There may have been no way to win then over.\n\nTo use a current example. Corey Booker voted against Sanders' drug importation amendment. He set down some valid reasons. People don't trust him though, because he received so much money from pharmaceutical lobbyists. They wonder, does he actually believe his reasons, or are they just excuses so he could vote in a way that benefitted his donors?\n\nThe same thing happened for Clinton with fracking. Did she really think it was a method of weaning our country off oil?  Or was her opinion formed because of her donations?\n\nI'm not looking for you to answer these questions. I'm looking for you to recognize how people can have those concerns. And how these are fair concerns.\n\nIf we address these concerns we can bring the party together. If we say "you want to much," we're effectively telling half the party that their concerns don't matter. 
As a "skeptical progressive" that feels "frozen out," numbers 3 and 4 are important to me. I don't know if Perez can really win back a lot of the Sanders-wing. For the record, I registered as a Democrat when I was 18, voted in every election (including midterms) down-the-line D . . . but, I'm not pleased with the direction the party is going. I am very economically progressive, and I vote on those economic issues primarily. As much as I love the social direction of the Democratic Party, I don't know if I can sacrifice my vote to a party that (in my opinion) is doing everything they can to avoid substantive economic reform. 
I'm a Bernie-fan myself. But we need to stop throwing blame. Let's work on healing the divide. Everyone wishes things had turned out differently. The question is now, how do we fix it?
Right now part of the division comes from a distrust of the "establishment." Ask yourself why people like Tulsi Gabbard (who is arguably not very left on many issues) is more popular with the far-left than someone who is, arguably, more left-wing than Tulsi?  It's not just about $3.\n\nBut, if you legitimately think that the Clinton wing is perfect and all the problems lie with the Sanders wing, then there's no point in discussing anything. Because we can never move forward if only one side is accused of being wrong, and the other side is immaculate.
>Is this just a thing that happens in comics?\n\nFrom time to time. It's especially more common when they're trying to tie in a bunch of different titles into one crossover story.\n\nI'm probably going to be a bit lost myself because though I liked the Deadpool film, the humor falls short in the comics for me so I don't read them and I REALLY don't like The Inhumans or how Marvel is trying to push them on us because they don't have the film rights for mutants.
I completely understand what you are saying.  I don't fully agree, but I understand your points.  I understand the point of money in politics, but I think that the DNC needs to take some legitimate and strong steps to curb the *influence* of money in politics.  If they don't, there are many progressives they won't win back.\n\n> Moderates are feeling alienated and politics is getting too partisan and too chaotic.\n\nThe problem is, many Progressive Democrats are feeling alienated too.  It feels like our ideas are overlooked, and (at best) given lip-service.  Ellison is in a position that, until proven otherwise, appears to be powerless.  All of positions *elected* by the DNC earlier this week went to establishment candidates.  And, to top it off, there are many moderates who make fun of us - who tell us we're being babies and throwing tantrums because we didn't get everything we wanted.  To be honest, it's less about not getting what we want, it's more about the other side getting most if not all of what they want (maybe making a few concessions that didn't really matter that much), and then telling us to "unify."  It's kind of insulting.  And then to be *actually* insulted on top of that, it makes us feel left out.\n\nTake a look at this sub and (for a slightly more extreme example) r/BlueMidterm2018 .  If you try to post anything remotely critical of the way the party is being run, you're downvoted.  You're told "bye Felicia."  You're called "stupid" or "baby."  It's said that you only vote how Bernie tells you and that you can't think for yourself.  Now, I'm not saying that Bernie-supporters are angels - many of them are just as bad.  But they're not "sore winners" either.\n\nBut, it's the same people making fun of the Progressives that are calling for unity.  Or, more accurately, telling us to "get in line."  Regardless of what the DNC is doing, I want to be united with other Democrats.  Maybe I'm angry with the way the DNC is handling things, but I want to work with my colleagues.  However, I feel like I can't even do that anymore.\n\nThank you for trying to work with the other side.  I want to work with moderates.  I want to compromise.  But we can't do that unless we [talk with one another](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/5vyb3b/coming_together/).\n\nEDIT: Seriously, look at the [comments on this same article](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/5x02mb/the_dnc_got_it_right/) posted in r/hillaryclinton .  Apparently, everyone who's upset with this decision is "alt-left," a "Russian Internet Troll," "angry," and "bitter."  Yet their tagline is "Stronger Together."
Go on r/JusticeDemocrats and search for any thread about identity politics. They are so against identity politics that it borders on racism. I'm an avid Bernie supporter, and that subreddit scares me.
They wouldn't. But that doesn't mean the DNC shouldn't have its own independent investigation into how its 2016 primary was conducted.
No reason for Ellison supporters to complain?  This whole election was symbolic. There was a chance to win disaffected Sanders-supported back. Instead the party said "ƒυ¢₭ you, we're choosing someone that supported the TPP, refuses to do anything about big banks when given the chance, and doesn't see a problem with corporate lobbying."  I am ∂@₥И insulted.

And we are all connected with each other 
I am legitimately in the school library right now writing a brief, occasionally taking a 20-second break to check Reddit.  I'm sorry, but knocking on doors isn't more important than maintaining my GPA at this point.\n\nAnd second of all, Ellison and Perez showing their faces together doesn't mean that Ellison has any power, other than a face to get the Bernie-wing out voting.  And, furthermore, attending the Latino Political Power Summit isn't an action that furthers economic progress.
The whole party is with him on social issues. Where is he on economic issues?  Anti-TPP?  Pro breaking up banks?  Against corporate donations? Pro-Single payer?  Because you can't call yourself progressive if you're only progressive on social issues.
I'm curious now how many PUMAs from 2008 are part of the avid anti-Bernie crowd?

They need to first heal the divisions between the Sanders-wing and the Clinton-wing.\n\nThe Sanders-wing feels completely rejected: like none of their ideas or preferred policies are being used and they're still expected to vote for a party that doesn't represent their interests. And the Clinton-wing feels like the Sanders-wing is demanding and throwing tantrums.\n\nThe Sanders-wing is very economically progressive. The Clinton-wing, not necessarily.\n\nAt this point, the Democratic Party needs to heal this divide, or they'll never unify their message.
What concessions?  We wanted money out of politics. That wasn't in the platform. The platform committee had mostly Clinton people on it. It didn't move on fracking or the TPP.  The platform was non-binding. And essentially all we got was lip-service. The majority of Bernie supporters voted Clinton, and those that didn't weren't enough to sway the election. Ellison was supported by a lot of establishment Democrats. \nWe're not even asking for concessions. We're asking for proof that we're not being rejected. But, apparently that's too much.\n\nI have been more than nice to Clinton supporters. Why is it crazy to ask for respect in return?  There's a difference between being pro-Clinton and being anti-Sanders.
I'm afraid of starting a relationship. The thought of taking that first step and the possibility of being rejected terrifies me so much that I've accepted the fact that I'll probably never find love. I really want to be in a relationship…but I don't think it will ever happen. One day I'd like to have kids, but, as a probably permanently single man, it's likely that that's off the table for me. I'm resigned myself to the fact that I'll probably be alone for life. And that thought really depresses me.
The TPP also supported an ISDS which would've given corporations a ton of more power. But that's beside the point. I'm not here to debate the merits of free trade. I asked a question.\n\nWhy should I, or anyone else that is economically progressive, should support the DNC or be happy with the new chair?  You can disagree with our policies all you want, but, if we have them, why should we support a party that doesn't share them?
I'm freaking out because this was an insult to a whole wing of the party and because—let's be honest—on economic policy, Perez is just more of the same.
Your wing of the party is already in power and has been in power. The Bernie wing feels dejected and hopeless. Hillary wouldn't throw a bone to us an dominate an economic progressive for VP. Sanders was given an in-name only position. Every time the Sanders wing pushes for a more economically progressive policy, we're told "no" and told to "get in line."  Ellison was supposed to be a compromise. He was supposed to be a politician that both wings of the party could get behind — heck he was supported by a lot of the corporate wing of the party. Policy-wise (except on economic issues) Ellison and Perez were very close. And, if the chairman had nothing to do with economic policy, as you suggested, then there was no reason not to elect Ellison, except as a "ƒυ¢₭ you" to a wing of the party that already feels rejected and left out. That being said, the DNC also voted today to not reinstate the lobbyist ban that Obama had put in place…so, yeah.\n\nThis was a very depressing day for a whole wing of the party. We're trying to keep it together. As the winning wing, it's your job to try to help bring us in and let us know that our voices and concerns are heard. Not to insult us and bring us down for feeling bad. We need to work together as a party. But insulting half of the party is just going to further splinter it.
The doorstop thing (that keeps the doorknob from hitting the wall) fell off. Everything you said is correct. That being said, I barely play video games even casually anymore thanks to law school.
Y'know, it's perfectly fine for you to be ideologically opposed to Sanders. But I've never witnessed Sanders-supporters trolling Clinton-forums making fun of Clinton. Sure, they'll express their disagreements, but they don't make fun of Clinton and her supporters the way you make fun of Sanders supporters. I've seen your comment history. I feel sad for you that you feel compelled to do this. Someone must've really hurt you.
My theory:\n\nThe closer a vampire is descended from Maloker, the more powerful he or she is.\n\nMaloker is the sire of the first vampires. Those vampires that he directly sired were the most powerful as they were the most closely "related" to Maloker. Vampires also, canonically, take on a more demonic visage when they reach a certain age (e.g., The Master, the Prince of Lies, Russel Winters, Kokistos, etc.). If one of Maloker's direct "descendants" were to reach a certain age, he'd be essentially indistinguishable from a demon. He'd be supremely powerful, he'd look demonic.  That was how Archaeus came to be.\n\nThis also explains why Darla, Angel, Drusilla, and Spike are more powerful than most vampires: they are more closely "related" to Maloker, Spike being only 5 generations from him (you'd have to assume the average vampire is thousands of generations from Maloker).\n\nLikely, most other vampires directly sired by Maloker didn't live long enough to earn a name for themselves like Archaeus did.\n\nWhen a human is made into a vampire, it keeps its memories. It's soul moves on. And it's body is inhabited by a newly created demon: that demon becoming slightly more diluted with each successive "generation."\n\nIn the case of zompires, they have the memories. They are undead. But they don't get the demon. Essentially, they lack the hire brain function the demon provides.\n\nThat's my take anyway.
10th grade. Our Latin teacher had (according to rumor) at one point ran over a cow in his car. Or something like that. For whatever the reason, he was deathly afraid of cows. (Apparently, at a previous school he worked at, he broke down crying, locking himself in a closet because the class wouldn't stop "mooing.")\n\nThis teacher was also supremely creepy. He would often make too-personal comments toward one of the students in class. Occasionally they bordered on sexual. I should mention this was an all-boys school.\n\nAnyway, one day this teacher goes on a tangent about life in Ancient Rome. So, one student in class asks a question about Roman diet.  The teacher gave a brief explanation of what the Roman's ate. But the student followed-up asking if the Roman's ate beef, or drank cow's milk.\n\nI, honestly, don't remember the teacher's answer other than he specifically refused to say "beef" or "cow."  Instead he said "meat from that animal."  So, the rest of the class started asking him more questions relating to cows in Ancient Rome. If I remember correctly, occasionally a student would quietly make a mooing noise and we would all pretend we heard nothing.\n\nFYI, the teacher later resigned (years after I graduated) when he was reported for asking a student why he took so long in the bathroom, specifically "why did it take you so long?  Were you molested in there?"
They already voted to not reinstate the ban.\n\nAnd the best option depends on who you ask.
Oh, they do. And they're jerks for it. But that doesn't make you less of one. I have my disagreements with Clinton, but I look to try to find common ground where possible. Yes, I express my frustration, but I never troll. And I certainly have never been a sore winner.\n\nLet's try [coming together](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/5vyb3b/coming_together/?st=IZPQ4MRW&sh=269f5dba).
Very true.  Which is why I'm unhappy.\n\nBe careful, though: You're admitting something that could be perceived as negative about a member of the Democratic Party—you might get downvoted!
She's already shirtless, just wearing a vest.  Tom is halfway there.
I want to quit the party. I don't care how progressive Perez is. This is a slap in the face to half the party. This is picking someone who doesn't care to change the economic policies of the DNC. This is saying "no change, get in line."  I am trying so hard to come back to the party!  I voted down the line Democrat in every election (even midterms) since I could vote. Obviously the party wants my vote, but doesn't want to make any change that's actually economic in nature. I feel so defeated and alone. This is just step 1 to losing again in 2018 and 2020. The people who voted third-party won't be won back. I'm just sad.
Fine. But don't claim that someone holding those positions are just as "progressive" as Ellison. And also, if you don't mind, please explain to me, if my main objective is to get money out of politics, break up big banks, and stop deals like the TPP, I should be happy about Perez?  Explain to me why I should support a party that doesn't align with me on these issues. These are make-or-break issues for me.
Your comment needs to be a top comment. Thank you!\n\nI feel much the same way, except from the other side. I pushed hard for Bernie in the primaries, but was ready to vote for Clinton in the general (I knew Bernie had no chance of winning the nomination).  But I grew disheartened as the primaries continued. I saw articles on the Huffington Post saying that the only reason to vote Sanders was if you were sexist. I saw people insisting that, because Bernie wasn't a real Democrat, he shouldn't be allowed in the campaign.\n\nI was turned off by Clinton's lack of a strong economic message. And I'm still turned off by Democratic politicians who appear to be voting for their donors (alas, I cannot prove that is what they're doing, but when you receive a ton of donations from a lobby then vote against a popular bill that lobby opposes, it raises eyebrows).  And whenever I talked about my concerns regarding Clinton, I was brushed aside. Or worse, I was lectured and told how all of my fears and concerns about Clinton's financial interests were wrong. If I doubted Clinton, they said I was in essence supporting Trump. It pushed me away.\n\nBut, as bad as the vocal minority of anti-Bernie Clinton supporters are, the extreme Bernie-supporters also exist. I had to leave the group JusticeDemocrats because (among other reasons), they are so against "Identity Politics" that they come across as racist and sexist. There are Berners today who are so interested in pushing the party to the left that they can't see how only moderate Democrats have a hope in certain Red States.\n\nI want to embrace the Clinton folks if they'll embrace me back. We won't agree on everything. But if we can see each other's perspective that we can work toward a middle ground.\n\nThank you!
I just hope they let us change the rules.  It looks like they're resisting every attempt we make to try to change them.  And, even when the Democrats get back into power, I don't trust that they'll want to change the rules - many politicians are making too much money from corporate lobbyists.
I'm new to reddit, so I don't know how to give gold. But pretend I just gave you gold. We need more people like you to help bridge this gap. The time for fighting is over. Let's start talking about what each side is FOR (not against) and start figuring out how we can work for those goals in a way that doesn't offend the other side. And, most importantly, let's start talking about what goals we SHARE, to really bridge that divide.
I, legit, convinced myself that I could "read auras" when I was in middle school and high school. I wanted so badly to be psychic (in a superpower sense) that it was embarrassing. 
Buffy the Vampire Slayer:\n\nWarren Mears dressed up as a mad scientist for Halloween 1997.
The question I have then is (A) do people getting involved magically get over the divide or (B) is getting over the divide a prerequisite to getting involved?  Because I'd like to see more people come together, and I'd like to know how to convince them to do that. How did you get over the divide?
That only works if you (A) have a platform people can get behind and (B) the politicians are actually following the platform.\n\nCertain groups won't get behind a candidate *just* because he's a Democrat. Even if he's charismatic, some people won't vote for someone unless he espouses their beliefs.\n\nSo, yes, I agree. Let's fix the platform. Let's find a charismatic candidate. But let's find a candidate that actually represents that fixed platform.
You may be right. But people are still upset.\n\nShe was for the TPP and now she's against it. She is pro-fracking, and gets money from industries that are also pro-fracking. That is her record. That makes people suspicious.\n\nNow maybe the rest of her record is on the straight and narrow. And there are only those few missteps. Maybe those aren't even missteps: there's a very good chance that she had legitimate reasons for changing her position on the TPP and maybe she would've supported fracking even without donations.\n\nBut pointing to her record won't necessarily convince people. Healing division is not about lecturing, it's about asking people what's wrong and moving toward fixing the problem.\n\nI'm guilty of this too! I've argued with people who insisted that Sanders was a sexist and that he's in the pocket of the NRA. His whole record contradicts that. But I convinced no one by explaining that to them. What I needed to do was ask them how I can show them otherwise, and how Bernie could change to prove to them that he was on their side.\n\nI'm trying to be fair and even handed here. I'm explaining faults with both sides of the party. You seem to be only concerned with what's wrong with the Sanders fans. I hope that's just a product of this conversation. Because if you can't see the faults on both sides, then we'll never move forward.
Dude, I'm trying to help here. I'm trying to explain why I believe there is a division in the party. Let's work on healing the divide instead of arguing that everyone who doesn't get in line is a problem.\n\nWhy did some people not vote for Clinton?  Was the 5% the most important part of the platform to them?  Maybe they didn't trust Clinton to actually follow the platform? The TPP was a big thing, and there was no language in the platform opposing it; did that bother people?  If 100% of the platform was changed, would people then have supported Clinton?  Maybe something else.\n\nLet's work on discovering the problem. But calling people stupid because they have an objection to a candidate doesn't solve the problem. Saying "you're wrong for feeling that way," doesn't fix anything. Asking "what can we do to help you feel better," does.\n\nSanders fans need to recognize that they won't get everything they want. But Clinton fans need to recognize that saying "we gave you X, you're stupid for not being happy," isn't going to unify the party.\n\nLet's work together.
The problem is that Darla is immediately a more powerful vampire after being re-sired by Drusilla.  How does she become so powerful right away?  If it had to do with her own age as a vampire, she'd be relatively weak.  But if it had to do with her sire's power or age, then it would make more sense.\n\nIf we assume Archaeus is extremely old powerful and therefore produces more powerful offspring, then it makes sense that the Master would also be powerful.\n\nIf the Master is powerful and old (as evident from his permanent physical changes), then it makes sense that Darla (1st siring) would also be very powerful.  We have no record of the Master siring any other vampires, although it's possible he did (Luke, for instance, may have been the Master's offspring, and he was relatively powerful).\n\nDarla only ever sired one person: Angelus, who was very powerful (because Darla was old?)\n\nAngelus only canonically sired a handful of people: Drusilla, Penn, Lawson, Sarah Holtz, and Theresa.  Drusilla is canonically very powerful (she's not particularly old though).  Penn and Lawson can be assumed to be relatively powerful (considering how much damage they did, albeit we don't see enough of them to be certain).  Neither Sarah Holtz or Theresa survive more than a day as a vampire, so we cannot be reasonably sure of their power levels.\n\nDrusilla, who was very powerful, sired a handful of people: Spike, Sheila, and Darla (2nd time).  Spike and Darla were both exceptionally powerful.  Sheila didn't survive a day, so we cannot be sure (and, admittedly, Drusilla was weakened when siring her…so she was not a powerful sire).\n\nSpike sired three people: his mother, Holden Webster, and Charlotte.  None of these people survived long enough as vampires for us to be sure of their power levels.  Although, it's possible that Spike (as a relatively young vampire who was sired by a relatively young vampire, who was sired by a relatively young vampire), didn't produce particularly powerful offspring.\n\nEvery other vampire we meet during the course of Buffy or Angel is either (A) implied or directly stated to be really old, or (B) not particularly powerful.\n\nSo, logically, in my opinion, a vampire's power level is derived from two sources: his or her age, and the power level of his or her sire.\n\nThere has to be some explanation for the varying power levels of vampires.\n\nNow, if we take as fact that Maloker is the progenitor of all vampires, the question becomes, what is up with Archaeus?  How did Arceus also make vampires?  Other demons that have mixed their blood with humans, but those half-breeds weren't vampires.  So, either (A) Archaeus and Maloker have something in common allowing them to both sire vampires as opposed to siring other demons; or (B) Archaeus was somehow made by Maloker.\n\nOption (A) would be entirely too coincidental for me.  So, let's assume (for the time-being) that Option (B) is the case.  If (B) is the case, we need to decide how Maloker made Archaeus.  Either (1) Maloker made a demon or (2) Archaeus is a vampire of some sort.\n\nIf we assume option (1), it begs the question, why did Maloker even bother making vampires if he could literally make demons?  If we assume option (2), then we know that Archaeus was both sired by a very powerful creature, and was very, very old by the time he sired the Master.  So, if Archaeus was literally a vampire at some point, his age would've made him look demonic by the time he was old enough to sire the Master.  And he would've been sired as already extremely powerful because of who his sire was.  It fits in perfectly with what we can already assume: that a vampire's power is determined by the power of his or her age and the power of his or her sire.
I'm looking for the posts from the CTR crowd telling Bernie supporters that we're "stupid," "throwing tantrums," and "cost Hillary the election."  Oh, and let's not forget how "Bernie isn't even really a Democrat," and "you're ignorant for siding with him," and "you'll just like anything that Bernie supports because you have no mind of your own."  And, of course, they'll finish their posts by calling for "unity."
Do you have an alternate theory?
In reality, there is very little. In practice, there is a whole lot.\n\nThere are some (fringe) Christians who think that because God created the world for humans to use, using it must be good. Therefore, humans using the world can't possibly be harming it. Therefore, manmade global climate change is a myth.\n\nBut most Christians who don't believe in global climate change formed their opinions another way.  They were (for religious reasons) anti-abortion, or anti-gay marriage, or [insert social issue here].  The Republican Party (especially during the George W. Bush-era) very much aligned with those conservative Christians on social issues. Because of today's political polarity, if you like a politician on one or two points that you're very passionate about, it's easy to align with them on issues you're not as passionate about. So, Christians often aligned with the socially conservative Republican politicians, then started to adopt their beliefs regarding economic issues, foreign policy, and (yes) climate change.
What other vampires in the Aurelius bloodline aren't shown to be more powerful than other vampires?
Thank you!  Although I remain disenchanted with Clinton, I appreciate your willingness to work together to move forward instead of resorting to name-calling. (Unfortunately, there are many Clinton supporters — and Sanders supports too — who are too busy fighting each other to try to find common ground).  All of this fighting just polarizes the party more.\n\nWhenever a Sanders supporter calls Clinton "corrupt," and whenever a Clinton supporter insists that Clinton was immaculate and there was no reason to vote against her, we widen the divide between the sides. The truth is usually somewhere in between.\n\nI left u/JusticeDemocrats because of all the vitriol for Clinton (among other reasons).  I, in part, started this thread because I don't want to see this sub fall into the same trap but from the other side (there is undeniably a lot of hate for Sanders-supporters here).\n\nLook, we all have different opinions on what the goal of the party should be, how progressive or moderate it should be, how fast we should move, how we should handle donations, etc.  But if we fight about those differences we'll go nowhere. Instead we need to talk about them.\n\nA lot of Sanders supporters felt pushed aside during the election cycle, not because they didn't get what they wanted, but because they felt like everything they were given was lip service, and because they felt like they were being told to "get in line". Clinton supporters are starting to feel upset now because those pushing the party to the left are doing so in a rather unwelcoming way.\n\nWe need to find common ground and starting asking questions, or this divide will only grow.
Ideally that's what I want, but I recognize that's not realistic. In the short term, though, I would like a politician that doesn't make decisions that are in favor of big businesses at the expense of the people. I'm suspicious of any politician that takes significant money from corporations, banks, or other, similar moneyed interests. \n\nLook; I know my preferred policies need to be implemented gradually: I get that. I'm not an idiot. But, when a politician selects to grant waivers to a bank that violates tax law, im suspicious. When a politician gets hundreds of thousands of dollars from a corporate lobby then votes against a popular amendment that would've harmed that corporation but benefitted the average person, I'm unhappy. \n\nIs that unfair?
Sub is set to private, FYI
RIP Herbert, we hardly knew ye.
I completely agree.  We need to focus heavily on social justice.  It's very important.  But *just* focusing on social justice is not acceptable either.  We need to focus on both.  And I'm not convinced that Perez has the economic-justice bonafides I'm voting on.
Exactly!\n\n:-)
There are relatively few vampires of the Aurelian bloodline introduced.  How, though, do you explain the strength of Darla, Angelus, Drusilla, and Spike, who are, canonically, stronger than other vampires?
Ellison declared his candidacy first.\n\nEdit: seriously?  Downvotes for stating an objectively true fact?  Is CTR rewriting history now?
I agree. But I think we need to heal this divide in order to win.
With an attitude like that, no wonder we lost the election. I'm pouring my heart out here, upset. And your response? "Bye Felicia."  Not, "hey, it'll be fine, keep your head up."  You are a contributing factor into why there's such a split in the party.
>The more you speak the more you give element that could justify slavery, colonialism and pretty much any oppression.\n\nWell no, I'm a moral nihilist, my argument is that NOTHING can be morally justified (e.g., slavery), but neither can its opposition. \n\nEverything is just a preference, but since certain preferences tend to be more popular, due to them being evolutionarily beneficial, by default, a quasi-version of utilitarianism wins. This doesn't mean that it's right to follow utilitarianism (or that one version is BETTER than another), it just means that we're all essentially in like a giant film club; if you show a bunch of movies nobody likes, people will leave your club and join another. If you show films that a lot of people like though, your club will thrive. But that fact does NOT mean that these films are GOOD and the other films are BAD, it just means that a lot of people like some films and hate others.\n\n>That's a tu quoque\n\nNo, it'd only be a tu quo que if it sat alone (just like any other ad hominem).\n\n>veganism and ecological transition sound easier anyway.\n\nEasier, but probably less effective.\n\n>Stepping away for the psychopath thought experiment a second, you could also explain him why your preferences make more sens, which is what you do when you defend a political or moral position.\n\nThat's the thing though, you can't if he REALLY loves killing. Imagine if the thing you loved more than anything, even more than freedom outside a prison, was outlawed but you thought you could still get away with it, there's really no convincing argument now is there?\n\nThat's like trying to argue with somebody that they DON'T love pizza or that they DON'T hate the taste of feces.\n\n>which is what you do when you defend a political or moral position.\n\nPolitical positions are usually more about people not understanding what's causing their problem. Most people that favor trickle-down economics for instance, don't support it because they like having a lot of poor, disenfranchised people, they support it because they mistakenly believe it'll help the economy and prevent that. In that case, it's not me trying to enforce my preference, it's me trying to get them to agree on the best way to actualize our shared preference.\n\nOn the other hand, those that support it who know better (i.e., capitalists) are doing it because they're greedy and perhaps psychopathic. But there's not a rational moral argument there to compel them from stopping.\n\nShort of magically getting them to have empathy, the only way you could get people like Trump and the Koch brothers to stop what they're doing is to scare them into believing that the revolution will come for them (and they're already aware of that possibility hence them creating police states to protect themselves, propaganda to distract us and surveillance on us all).\n\nThey're acting in their own self-interest and us attempting to rise up and beat them is us doing them same, the only difference is that there's a lot more of us and they have more capital which allows them to control the law in a more effective way.
>What do you think about the Nintendo Switch & the new Zelda game?\n\nLooks amazing, but I'm going to wait for Mario before I buy the console (I like to buy consoles after the first run to make sure all the bugs are ironed out and they usually have cool promos later on). In the mean time, I'll be playing Zelda on my Wii U.\n\n>I just want to play great games\n\nI mean, Nintendo's first party games are consistently rated very highly, often winning game of the year from publications despite having underpowered hardware.\n\n>I really don't know what to expect from Zelda.\n\nOne of the all-time best series ever if not the best series ever (been playing since the first one came out). It's not something you can really get from watching a trailer unless you've played it before, but the atmosphere, play control and design are are what make it amazing not to mention it probably has the best, most iconic music in gaming. There's a reason [people reacted the way the way they did to the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfOM3yNVCZ8); it's just something you can't understand until you've played one.
>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night\n\nUgh... HATED this film. It's your classic watered-down-art-house-for the-masses film... like watching Eraserhead if you knocked it down 40 IQ points. I don't get the point of these films... they're not as complex/intelligent as real art-house, but they lack the accessibility of pop cinema just trying to be that... it's like the worst of both worlds.
>I don't really understand your position of preferring socialism over capitalism but at the same time not preferring being vegan over omni.\n\nI prefer socialism because it's functional for me, veganism is not.\n\n>You know Singer's a utilitarian, right?\n\nRight, but there are different versions of it. I personally draw the line when it comes to persons capable of participating within that framework. After that, I look at it like a spectrum.\n\n>Also, your post pre-supposes that error theory is true and you'd have to prove that in the first place.\n\nActually, no. Moral nihilism is a skeptical position just like non-supernatural is. If you want to convince me that something like supernatural entities exist or that moral truth conditions exist, the burden of proof is on you as you would be the one violating occam's razor.\n\n>Proving moral realism is trivial.\n\nProving a skeptical position is impossible, but not trivial. There's a big difference between agreeing to play by moral rules and believing they exist in the same way the rules of gravity exists.\n\n>Is killing people for fun wrong?\n\nNo, but if you've got the predilection to do so, be aware that most people prefer you don't and unless you can get away with it, there will be consequences. If killing people for fun is more important to you than your potential loss of freedom/life, it's probably not a good idea. But if it's so important to you that you don't want to live without that option, there's no rational moral argument in the world that supports that you should not.
One of the major reasons art is awesome is because of its power to change you.\n\nAvoiding art because it might enhance your view of the world is like avoiding treasure chests in the Legend of Zelda because you might find a new ability or upgrade.\n\nYou shouldn't be running from it, you should be running right towards it. Eventually, you get to a point where it's harder and harder to find stuff like that and you'll appreciate the stuff that does it for you.
>Constant narration of this sort also breaks the fourth wall. You, as the player, know that the mumbling protagonist is talking to YOU. Actually, it's the game itself talking to YOU. It breaks any kind of suspension of disbelief.\n\nIt's impossible for me to play a game and not be very aware of it so this isn't an issue for me. If we're talking about other mediums though, I actually prefer wall breaking when it's done in a brechtian way to keep the viewer aware (but not in that obnoxious pseudo-clever way you might occasionally see on shows like Community).\n\nMax Payne had some fun with this sorta thing, iirc...
GOT IT!!!
I just read Uncanny X-men #17 and the entire premise of the comic is based on a detail that wasn't at all mentioned in IvX#2 (the latest IvX comic released as far as I know) which means you MIGHT want to wait and follow the checklist... this is probably what you were talking about.\n\nIt's also possible that they just won't mention it in the IvX comics. If it matters, it wasn't like a huge spoiler or anything.
Yeah, the only thing I can compliment it on was the music production (keep in mind, I'm not saying the score was good, just the production/instrumentation... the music itself was forgettable as anything from Stranger Things which also benefits from nice music production against poor music composition/writing).
>With most of it being opinionated it seems like another bullshit religion.\n\nRight, but since at least SOME of it ISN'T simply just an opinion, it's not significantly similar though I will admit that certain political opinions fall into this realm.\n\n>Allegedly it affects my life but I dont see much evidence of it directly effecting my life.\n\nTry moving to Somalia or something and you'll see how much politics affects your life.\n\n>Even if i try to educate myself, i come a cross loads of information that is contradictory to another and I really cant choose a side.\n\nYeah, but the same is true for a lot of things including science. For example, since we currently can't really test things like string theory, it's hard to setup camp there or with competitive ideas, but that doesn't make these pursuits irrational or anything.\n\n>Everyone in that realm is eager to shame and throw shit at each other for no good reason.\n\nNow you're making a blanket statement and you're mind reading. Imagine this scenario: we have 5 paths with which to choose to hit our destination. Everybody has an opinion, some are based on reasoning, some are based on better reasoning, and everybody is arguing about it including the person who has picked the right path for rational reasons. Just because others aren't being as reasonable as he doesn't mean you should automatically throw him in with the rest of the pile.\n\nHell, the same is true for philosophy. Go to /r/philosophy and arrogantly claim that nihilism is the correct view and you'll see a lot of push back too. Does that mean it's stupid to be concerned with ideas like nihilism since there seems to be lots of groups of people that disagree?\n\nWhen you really think of it, politics should just be seen as part of the third branch of ethics (i.e., applied) which is philosophy (just like science was, and still technically can be seen as, a branch of philosophy). \n\n>Politics is just like a religion to me\n\nAgain, there are some similarities, but to say it's JUST like religion is pretty off.
8 from what I've seen... could be a 9. Don't sell yourself short because you're gorgeous.
It looks like as far as the core series is concerned, we're actually LOSING an X book. Right now, we have Extraordinary X-men, Uncanny X-men and the All-New X-men... Gold looks to be replacing Extraordinary and Blue looks to be replacing All-New... soooo, what about Uncanny?\n\nLook... spoiler alert below...\n\n.\n \nI understand that Magneto will go back to being a bad guy, but that doesn't mean we can't have Psylocke lead that team.\n\nMaybe Weapon X can fill that void...\n
>No I'm making fun of OP for posting something he knew would get a negative response in a thread\n\nIt was /r/askreddit, not /r/parenting. I'd say it was a pretty neutral place, but I don't know...
Allegedly JCVD scored a victory with one during his kickboxing career.
Haven't seen it.
>This is a weird misrepresentation of what poly is.\n\nI wasn't suggesting this is what poly is, just supporting the person that said it's a lot easier for good looking people to find partners and demonstrating how astronomically easier it is for somebody like Scarlett.
Worked for me.

Meh. An artist wrote something that made sense and is REALLY making sense now, and others are noticing, so let's make fun of them for pointing it out?\n\nHow anti-intellectual is that?\n\nHe was right and so he has the right to say, "I told you so," just as those supporting him do. Jesus Christ, when Thom Yorke said, "You have not been paying attention" and his fans quoted him, they didn't do this. It hurts me to say this when NIN is my favorite artist, but maybe the Radiohead fans are smarter than the NIN fans (though I love both).\n\nI could see if /r/nin had a lot going on in the mean time, but it doesn't, so it's not like it's muddling up an active subreddit.\n\n"You're going to get what you deserve."
>The got version implies that the celebrity perhaps did something to bring that recognition upon themself. It brings the recognition "inward":\n\nGood point. I think using *got* also works best when one is trying to emphasize some value, good or bad, to the verb. I'm going to use some crass examples, but that's sorta the point...\n\n"Man, you got punked/burned/pwned!" has more power than, "Man, you were punked/burned/pwned!" In this case, it's almost like the word 'got' has a relationship with another of its usages (i.e., "I GOT you!"). In other words, *got* makes it more apparent that one wouldn't want any of those things.\n\nAnd for a positive example...\n\n"Did you hear?!? John got laid at the club!" adds more excitement and a positive value to the verb than simply saying, "Did you hear?!? John was laid at the club!"\n\nSo in regards to the OP's example, I'd say *got* is more appropriate if one is trying to emphasize that being recognized is a bad or good thing whereas *was* is a bit more neutral.
>which the production has enhanced the artist's work to a completely different level\n\nFor this specific criteria, **Lou Reed's Berlin** is the best I can think of. He's had a lot of good stuff, but it was the only album where he went full-blown upscale with the production (courtesy of Bob Ezrin who produced Pink Floyd's The Wall).\n\nTake any stripped down song of his, he has several in his catalog, and then compare it with The Bed... it's next-level stuff.\n\nAs for best production in general, for me, it's gotta be a tie between NIN's **The Downward Spiral** and **The Fragile.** The former took a fuck ton of samples and made them somehow organic whereas the latter took a fuck ton of stringed instruments and made them sound like electronic instruments.\n\n
If you're playing the HD version, make sure to regularly check out an auction section of the game because there's an item in there which will come up that will DRAMATICALLY decrease tedium in the game.

1. Being the most LEFT is something to admire, not liberal.\n\n2. Here's a pundit from the very same network who is MORE left than Rachel, Lawrence O'Donnell, explaining his much better position...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxKd5lpZwLY
IF you've got the money to spare, I like to use [melda's autoalign](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MAutoAlign) for this kinda thing.
It's the least important of the big 5 for me (in order, I like Form, Theme, Style, Character, Plot).
The terms still are influential in law, and even with how we developed terms like APD. At least colloquially, there's a big difference and that difference still has relevance from a sociological perspective (the difference being that psychopaths are seen as mostly products of their biology whereas sociopaths are the mostly the products of their environment like those kids in Africa forced at young ages to join armies who go on to rape, torture and kill but who would probably have grown up normally in any normal environment).
Hmmm, this joke has been done a few times. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMX3i492iFI).
But why wouldn't they send that to all of us?
>Sometimes it is possible that you learn about ideas that may occur to you at hard times in your life out of nowhere and drag you down as well.\n\nAh yes, the Ayn Rand factor.\n\n>I don't know if I would read The Conspiracy Against The Human Race by Ligotti for example.\n\nHaven't read it myself, but from what I know of the author and its description, it just sounds like a nihilistic antinatalist work of non-fiction.... nothing wrong with either of those positions... in fact, I'd say they're both incredibly rational views (of course, I too am a nihilist and an antinatalist).
>So a mentally disabled person in a condition that doesn't allow him to to engage in that kind of relation is outside your moral considerations ? Their systematic abuse and exploitation wouldn't be a question worth addressing ?\n\nThis is a nice catch on your part. I've actually thought about this before and though I'll let this group get a pass, there IS one caveat to it which is that mental retardation, IMO, should be something we properly try to extinguish from the populous (that doesn't mean killing them though, it just means we use science to prevent it from happening). Some people find that view controversial, especially when you move along the autism spectrum since certain manifestations of the latter get WAY more intense than something like asperger's, but I do think it would maximize utility.\n\nOn the other hand though, if I were in a burning a building and could only save a person like you've just described or a healthy person, I'd always go with the latter.\n\n>So I get it orphans with no relatives shouldn't have any right either?\n\nBabies, in general, are considered widely valuable to most of the population. Have you ever looked into how hard it is to adopt?\n\n>Or only the non-viable ones who will never turn into an adult able of reciprocating ?\n\nI have no problem with letting babies with things like harlequin syndrome be euthanized if that's what you're asking.\n\n>That you can't prove a normative claim doesn't mean you shouldn't base your position on relevant concepts, and sentience is the most relevant metric in that case IMO.\n\nI agree, but I don't just settle on sentience, I need a higher level of it. If all sentience were created equal, then me plowing a field and killing some field mice in the process would be seen as immoral and I don't see a society functioning when it's that concerned with those things (again though, if it's not any trouble for me to let non-harmful life live, I'm more than happy to go with an alternative).\n\nLike I told another user, there has to be SOME reciprocation because otherwise, I'm simply having to put too much effort/energy into something without getting a big enough return. As a person with compassion, I obviously would prefer that all living things get to live and do their thing if all it took was me snapping my fingers once.
That actress looks familiar...
Yeah, numbers are a bit off there, but in the process of detailing it out, I did find something pretty interesting...\n\nThe first video games were made in the late 50s, but the first modern games (i.e., where there were levels, graphics, progress and stories) came out by 1980 with *Mystery House* (and arguably sooner if other people want to chime in) so we're talking about a medium that's been modern for at least 37 years.\n\nModern cinema (i.e., feature-length cinema capable of telling a story in the same way a play could) didn't arrive until 1906 with *The Story of the Kelly Gang.*\n\nThe thing is, the most lauded film ever is more likely Citizen Kane than The Godfather (it beat out The Godfather for the #1 spot at AFI and for 50 years, held the sight and sound spot until Vertigo beat it out recently, but it's still number 2 while The Godfather is sitting at 21).\n\nWhat I'm getting at though is that Citizen Kane came out just 35 years after modern cinema had begun and BoTW is coming out 38 years after modern video games have begun.\n\nHYPE ALERT:\n\nEssentially, BoTW is not only poised to be game of the year AND best Zelda game of all time, but it COULD end up being hailed as the best game ever and hold that crown for a decade or two.\n\nOf course, if you want things to be REALLY modern (i.e., full sound), that came out a few years later with video games (not saying sound wasn't there, but there wasn't really a game that could do graphics, sound, progress and story until a bit later), whereas film didn't hit that point until 1927 (i.e., 21 years later) meaning that video games are currently WAY past their due and in terms of video games, we could be hovering around the equivalent of what was going on in 1964 cinema (which makes sense to me, I prefer Bergman over anything that's come out of Hollywood).
Haha, my grandparents let me watch the movie and I loved the game.
Having watching the original trailer and reactions to it dozens of times, I've practically memorized it shot for shot and I'm *really* impressed by how much you matched each shot with the Ocarina equivalent right down to only using the blue outfit. Great work.
Discomfort for a week and it only lasts for 10 years? Wouldn't it just be better to get a vasectomy?
If you plan on recording a full band at once or even micing a full drum kit, pro tools is your best option. If you plan on just recording things one instrument at a time, anything will suffice (I personally use an odd combo of pro tools and renoise which is a tracker... a completely different kind of DAW).
>Oh, shit, does it?\n\nYes.\n\n>The problem here is that plenty of people have subconscious\n\nYou're right. I missed that. I'm willing to admit I was wrong there, but I hope you're willing to admit that I'm still making a good point about the non-plenty people (and to be fair, I opened up my comment by acknowledging that).\n\n(I've also caught you in a straw man already too so we're even).\n\nAnd even though you caught me on that one thing doesn't mean you're right about the other stuff you said.\n\nThe bigger point I'm making is that we're talking into an echo chamber. Most people aren't willing to stick up for people on the outside of that and we're WAY to quick to call out bigots or to say something like, "Oh, you didn't like how they changed Thor into a girl or Spider-man into a hispanic? You bigot!"\n\nThere are definitely good reasons to not like this and though I'm sure a good chunk of people aren't thinking about it as deeply as I am, I don't appreciate the criticisms coming from those that are automatically being thrown into the bad category or at the very least, not even acknowledged. I'm the only one in this thread that has brought this up.\n\nI still maintain that it's OFTEN lazy characterization that is not only misrepresentative of the culture, but also a misrepresentation of the cultures themselves.\n\nLike I said, as a latino, I feel like when they just throw in a latino, it just becomes stupid, they're character becomes less interesting, it does a disservice to the latino community and I feel patronized/condescended-to as though I'm supposed to like this character just because of that.
Will they send it to our email account? I'm refreshing like crazy
What is wrong with you. There's nothing liike that track!
>And when they throw in a random normal guy it doesn't distract you\n\nWhy would it?\n\n>I don't know why a black guy would be random\n\nBecause as I said, black people in the US make up about 14% of the population. Not normal if you go much higher than that. Totally okay with using black guys/girls, or any minority for that, but there's a difference between writing for that group and just hitting a quota. When you watch a sitcom and one out of six people are black, that's quota reaching. Again, look at my link. People literally have huge misconceptions about race diversity and a lot of it has to do with this.\n\n>but a white guy would be normal\n\nLiterally, the word normal means common as in "higher percentage." Again, I'm a latino guy, same percentage as a black people, but when they throw in random groups, especially when other people don't and they don't and get criticized for it (like say, a film set in washington filled with white people), it's obvious they're playing the diversity game.\n\nI don't have a problem with diversity. I have a problem when they're obviously just filling in quotas especially when it doesn't make sense. It's not only stupid, but it doesn't do anything for the minority and doesn't speak to their group. When I watch a white show that throws in a Latino guy that's way out of sync, that doesn't make me relate to that guy as a latino, that just makes it obvious that they're trying check off a box.\n\n>different people are weird\n\nThe word different is literally a synonym for weird... not a gut feeling.\n\n>I guess I'm just a bigot, how interesting.\n\nNobody called/suggested you were a bigot, but your straw man is.\n\n
It also seems to be the case that touch screen features are removed from both.\n\nAnother user on reddit recently did an IAMA and mentioned draw distance though he did say you can see everything on the Wii U, it's just not as clear.\n\n[Here's a good video that compares the final versions of both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WKedAjitl0&feature=youtu.be)\n\nIt does seem to be the case that it's just a difference of 720p vs 900p which oddly, doesn't really affect the draw distance so much as it does the closer textures. A good example is at 1:21 in the video... look at the circular shape on the ground... the Wii U version is softer, but not to a degree that it matters much.\n\n
True. I guess it's good then that this guy didn't have a giant robot that could either fly-then-crush or roll-then-uppercut.
Lots of young impressionable people (usually boys) whose prefrontal cortexes have yet to develop (this is the area of the brain primarily responsible for compassion and logical thinking which doesn't mature until the age of 24-26)  and who have a very limited understanding of politics (perhaps they've taken econ 101 though) find her incredibly simple, selfish way of running the world to be viable.\n\nThere's even articles written about the phenomenon like [this one](http://brucelevine.net/how-ayn-rand-seduced-young-men-and-helped-make-the-u-s-into-an-uncaring-nation/) (though the "ayn rand factor" is just something I coined right now so don't bother googling that term... try "ayn rand" and young men/boys/teenagers if you want to find more).

Yeah, Trent's going to lose a lot of money to people that will just download the inevitable torrent.
Nice find. Tried the demo, loved it, so I purchased.
Perhaps, but I think the curve rises/falls exponentially. I'd say I'm a solid a 4-6, but I'm lucky to get laid once a year (though to be fair, I might turn down an opportunity about the same amount of times).\n\nBut being a 10 like Scarlett, and being a girl, doesn't mean she just has a much easier time finding a partner, it means she has an astronomically easier time. If she had the time and will, she could EASILY get laid by multiple partners in a single day every day for years without repeating a single partner: she could even discriminate and only choose attractive guys and it'd still work. I'd be willing to bet she could catch 3 a day in less time than it takes to pull a regular shift at work.
That's what I was thinking.
"I don't want to get into a semantic argument about it, I just want the protein"
Reminds me of [this first bit by Dan Mintz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaotfCeYWws).
Heh, if you think that's complicated, take a look at what more atonal composers do, whether that be those that use traditional instruments like [Penderecki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HilGthRhwP8) or computer stuff like Stockhausen. In fact, if you've got some time to kill, [check out a lecture from the latter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYmMXB0e17E&list=RDlYmMXB0e17E#t=812).
Don't know if it counts since you usually buy more instruments for it, but the vast majority of what I write is done through Kontakt.
Nope, those were the albums right before that employed binaural microphones (overrated technique, IMO). He was the first person to release a commericial album that way though.
I actually feel like you're going from being irrationally pessimistic to irrationally optimistic. It's quite possible that they think you suck and should quit, but it's also possible that they're thinking something less harsh.\n\nAll you can safely assume is that they're saying 'no' ...anything beyond that is simply conjecture.\n\nThe more important question is, even if they DID think you suck and should quit, is that a reason to do so? I can think of a TON of artists that I don't like (in fact, I probably dislike 99% of the art I've experienced), but that doesn't mean somebody else won't like it.\n\nMaybe the person that read your stuff was simply not your audience.\n\nOr maybe you suck and should quit... who knows?\n\nI say, if you've still got it in you, keep writing (if for anything, at least for yourself). If you really do suck, maybe finishing a bad novel or two will help you get better and to a place where people will want to publish your work.\n\nOr quit. I don't care... less competition for me ;)
Great album. Also, it's more industrial than Goth (the latter being a catchall for dark music in general as opposed to being a specific music genre).
Just sounds like a watered down version of classic horror/fantasy/epic music. There are literally points in the track (when the lead comes in the middle) where it'd make more sense as a dark fantasy theme (think Labyrinth or Dark Crystal) and by the end of the theme, it feels more like post-battle music in a superhero theme.\n\nIt uses a few extended notes and chords, but it feels really tonal not to mention it's written in a very non-synchopated 4/4 rhythm (sorry, the best horror themes are rhythmically jarring, often featuring weird time signatures or difficult rhythms within a duplet structure).
Same. I've never purchased ANY app ever until last night.
>"Suddenly Very Appropriate T-Shirt"\n\nIf he'd have just written "Very appropriate T-Shirt," he'd be accurate.
>But utilitarianism considers the utility of both parties involved equally.\n\nI am, it's just that the word "utility" among utilitarians means different things (especially if we're comparing "genuine" versions like yours and a quasi-version like mine). I'm adapting a quasi-version because it arrives by default (i.e., as I explained to another user, if there are no moral truth conditions, then there are only preferences, but if there are only preferences, then the more popular preferences win out which makes a quasi-version of utilitarianism win by default).\n\nIn this case though, it's STILL a preference as to what we include. Since there are no moral truth conditions guiding us, it's perfectly reasonable to draw lines (and btw, you're going to run into the sorites paradox no matter how you play this game moral realist or not). In this case, my line starts where people can and do obey the rules of the game.\n\nIn fact, let me go back to this point...\n\n>You're being biased towards the human species over other species. In other words, by eating animals, you're not maximizing utility since you're causing unnecessary suffering of other species for very little utility gained by you (chicken tastes good).\n\nEven your way of doing things is biased towards humans. We're the most destructive species on the planet. If you REALLY cared about maximizing utility in the way you've used the word, you'd be promoting the extinction of the human race.\n\n>What framework are you referring to which animals don't participate in?\n\nBeing able to play by the rules of utilitarianism (and actually doing so).\n\n>Moore's argument is convincing enough for me.\n\nOkay, let's have a look...\n\n>1. Killing babies for fun is wrong.\n\nJustify this premise, please...\n\n>Eror theory is false.\n\nBTW, error theory is just ONE version of moral nihilism, there's also non-cognitivism (I tend to lean more towards the latter camp).\n\n>This all logically follows\n\nWell, again, good luck justifying that first premise without falling victim to the Münchhausen trilemma and again, you're arguing a straw man by pegging error theory on me.\n\n>and most people would agree with it.\n\nMost people believe in the supernatural and that capitalism is the best economic system; I don't think fallaciously appealing to popularity is going to help you here.\n\n>Consider an incredibly intelligent psychopath like Hannibal. He loves to kill, he's good at it, and will never get caught and therefore there are no consequences to him. In your view, he isn't doing anything morally wrong?\n\nNo, he's just changing the world in such a way that goes against my preferences just as I would be doing the same to him if I caught him.\n\nNow keep in mind I'd probably use violence or LIE to him to get him to stop (i.e., saying that what he's doing is morally wrong in the way you are), but it'd all be bullshit said to propagate my preferences (and in this case, most people would probably share my preference and be fine with me lying or using violence).
[Genesis 1:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A29-30&version=KJV) "And God said, Behold, I have given you **every** herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat." Ah isn't the Bible great? Whichever argument you want to make, there's a verse to justify it.
Hmm...I didn't realize I had one.
It's the orchestration of the human race and its civilizations in one grand conflict
Yeah, I know the phrase, and it's generally down there with "it is what it is" as far intelligent responses go. It assumes that people are doing cheap things to achieve a specific goal when in fact, most people aren't trying to reach that goal at all. The idea that people are "falling in line with what's popular" is a silly thing to critique as it assumes people, by default, are trying to be original every moment of their lives... that or it suggests being in step with other people is inherently bad which it isn't.\n\nYou're essentially making fun of the OP for a submission that fits in well with the views of /r/childfree and using a meme to do so which couldn't possibly be any less brave if that's your thing (seriously, if you're going to critique somebody for conforming or being unoriginal, how about not conforming to popular unoriginal insults/memes?).\n\nThe only thing worse you could do would be to then respond by linking me to /r/iamverysmart\n
I always feel like drugs in video games tend to be used, ineffectively, as a tool for edginess: that or they're simply demonized.\n\nI prefer drugs being used simply for humor. Grog in the Monkey Island series or even beer in Redneck Rampage are good examples of this: the former being the better game, the latter implementing the alcohol into gameplay much better (i.e., you'd use beer as a power-up, but there was a drunk meter that decreased your mobility and accuracy as it filled up).
You mention bravery twice (in this comment and in a reply below).\n\nWhat makes you think the OP, or ANYbody for that matter, by default, is concerned with things like bravery, fear, courage or even karma when it comes to posting on reddit? It sounds like you're projecting. Personally, when I submit anything on reddit, I'm NOT thinking, "Gosh, I'm so scared people won't like this... maybe I should have gone with something safer."\n\nOr let me ask the question another way: if the point of a submission in a subreddit is to contribute something other subscribers will find interesting, what's the problem with submitting something that will OBVIOUSLY be appreciated?\n\nIf I submitted a link to the latest groundbreaking news concerning the upcoming Nintendo system at /r/nintendoswitch, would it be appropriate to respond with, "Wow, you linked us to information that EVERYBODY in the subreddit obviously wants to know... how brave of you"?
Where's the link??? Did you get it?
Yeah, being a beautiful film is always great, but it's not enough. Artists like David Lynch, Werner Herzog and Lars von Trier manage to make beautiful, artistic AND intelligent films. One element simply isn't enough.
It's an okay example, but I think a much better one would be Johnny Got His Gun. The author of the novel also wrote the screenplay and directed the screenplay so you can REALLY see how an artist has to change things to make things work without worrying about it being filtered through another artist (and the change is pretty dramatic).
Well I specifically mentioned that film because it's more art-house than anything and as an art-house film, it utterly fails. I can recommend dark art-house, but as far as horror is concerned, I'm not up to speed, or really interested in the new stuff so I probably couldn't recommend anything you haven't already heard of or have seen before. Whenever new horror comes out that is praised, I tend to watch just so I can keep up with pop culture, but I haven't seen a new horror film that's moved me since I saw Audition in theaters a LONG time ago.
My story is similar in the sense that NIN got me into a LOT of music, but the difference is that NIN is still my favorite band (though I don't listen to anything that could even be considered metal adjacent anymore).
>What about sociopath, psychopath\n\nThey're capable of both, but should they choose to break the rules, we have a little thing called prison for that.\n\n>and delusional psychotics?\n\nSame thing, except they might have the option to go to a mental institution.\n\n>What about young children?\n\nI personally see young children (and babies) as super-high-value property. There are serious consequences to destroying them just like there are for burning somebody's house down, destroying somebody's car, killing somebody's pet or going to an author's house and deleting an 800 page manuscript she's been slaving over for months/years. This is also why I'm okay with abortion, but not okay with somebody inducing an abortion in somebody that doesn't want it.\n\nOn the other hand, my system is also more inclusive in other ways. Should an animal (including aliens) or machine show that they're persons capable of participating, I'm all for their protection and would even value the Einstein of chimps over the life of a human newborn or somebody who's been in a coma for years and who's been shown to be brain dead.\n\n>Every time someone tries to explain what makes someone inside or outside their "moral community" they either do it in a way that can't be used to exclude all animals, exclude some humans too, or have to resort to some irrational essentialism (most adult humans are capable of reciprocating so I just extend this to all humans because why not).\n\nNot every time. I used the word "person" intentionally. There are a lot of of ways to define it, but you should look into it. It's not the DNA that matters, it's the pattern. If I were to slowly transfer my memories over to a driver smoothly over time to a point where I was now all silicon, I'd still consider myself a person even though I'd no longer be a human.\n\n>So are anti-capitalism, feminism, anti-racism and so on then.\n\nYep. Those are all preferences and I prefer all those things, I just don't pretend that it's morally good for me to have those preferences. I COULD perhaps argue that those ideas would lead to a peaceful, longer-lasting society, but even wanting those things is a preference; there could be a guy out there who wants to see it all burn down and that preference isn't any more justified than mine, it's just something I'll fight because again, that's my preference.
Some instruments won't load as libraries (can't remember why). This means you have to manually open them through the file library. Simply click the FILES tab near the top left corner, then search for your instrument which should be an .nki file.\n\nNow, if you're trying to load up an instrument that is encrypted and you did so illegally, there's really not much you can do except pay for it. Some instruments might load in DEMO mode (which will last for like 10-15 minutes before it shuts off) so I suppose you could program everything, load it up, and then export the track as an audio file, but that's a pain.
Switch is coming out soon... they might have him play something on that.
I included racism because it's the same issue... white straight males getting offended by anything different.
"let me in" said Ramirez, but standing next to me was Ramirez aswell.
>So you pick your beliefs based upon what benefits you\n\nNo, my beliefs are based upon logic (in this case, the combination of occam's razor and the is-ought problem lead to moral nihilism). From there, it's only reasonable to default on a quasi version of utilitarianism since it's just a battle of preferences and the preference shared by the most people wins.\n\nMy *preferences* are based upon what benefits me just as they are for EVERYBODY. Who wants to watch a movie they hate? Who wants to live in a world where the people/things they love are destroyed?\n\n>rather than the truth?\n\nYou say "the truth" so casually. I'd LOVE for you to justify moral realism for me and, in fact, x-post it over at /r/philosophy because I'm sure they'd get a kick out of you seemingly doing something nobody else has been able to do.\n\nStart with getting around the is-ought problem...\n\n
Obvious choice, but on the off chance you haven't read it yet, Wolverine: Old Man Logan is a crowd pleaser.

Man, a REAL Clive Barker and David Lynch collaboration would be insane.\n\nLynch adapting something like Barker's Sacrament would be mind-blowing.
>Alternatively, if this play has a strong comedic slant, you could have him or someone else just say outright that there weren't any black actors so he's standing in.\n\nThis is what I was going to suggest. Go balls out. You guys are from Denmark, so you should be familiar with the filmmaker Lars Von Trier who dealt with black stereotypes in a pretty absurd way himself in the film, Epidemic.\n\nYou could do other things like putting a sign around him that explains the situation or for a non-meta-yet-still-absurd way to get around this, write it so he has the disease, vitiligo.
>It's like somebody coming to your house and won't leave and then setting your house on fire and then getting MAD AT YOU when you try to put the fire out.\n\nAnd the reason they're setting your house on fire is because they want to roast marshmallows leaving you with the option of burning alive or moving to a new house.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nEven with the recent Civil War storyline, I took a side that I thought was obvious, but at least the opposing side seemed SOMEWHAT reasonable and at the very least, characters on both sides are interesting.\n\nThe most interesting things about The Inhumans are Medusa's hair (not her, just her hair), a character that can't talk and a giant.fucking.bulldog. Seriously?
I'm going to play devil's advocate here and make a few points that I think have been missing.\n\nI'd like to make two things clear first though: one, I'm absolutely aware that a lot of these responses DO come from bigotry and two, even though I'm being critical myself, I'm not at all what one might call "up in arms" or even upset... I'm mildly irritated at most when this happens to stuff I watch (in this case, I had no idea what Tracer even was until the I read the thread).\n\nHaving said that, I have two problems with this sorta thing:\n\nThe first is that the quota-filling attempts in the media become distracting. In the of gay/bisexual people, they [make up about 2.5% of the population](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/15/what-percentage-of-the-u-s-population-is-gay-lesbian-or-bisexual/?utm_term=.d17a0a5bc6cd) which is about 1 in 40 people but you'd never know that looking at the main cast of modern entertainment where it feels more like 1 out of 6 or 8.\n\nIn regards to race, my favorite show, Twin Peaks, and another big show Friends, both got shit for this, but having a cast of mostly white straight people as friends or mostly white straight people living in a small Washington town made sense because that's how things mostly work out. When they throw in a random black guy or a gay guy, it distracts me more than anything.\n\nMy second problem is that it feels lazy/forced. Making a cast member part of a minority is the cheapest way to make them stand out or gain a fan (I guess because I'm personally latino, I'm supposed to relate to the latino guy? )and incidentally, I often find those characters to be the least interesting because their bio was phoned in by way of doing that. The effect is even more pronounced when they double-up on these kinds of things and make a black lesbian, a transgender asian or something along those lines... it's like they're screaming, "We've got boxes to check off!" This issue for me, unlike the last one which affects me more as a viewer, is more about respecting artistry.\n\nI guess should also mention how some minorities seem to get more attention than others despite the population not looking anything like that (hispanics, middle-easterns and asians come to mind as group that gets represented way less compared to black people or even Indian people). Again, looking at stats, blacks and hispanics respectively make up 14% of the population, but you wouldn't know that watching network tv which explains why [peoples' perception of minorities are way off](http://www.gallup.com/poll/4435/public-overestimates-us-black-hispanic-populations.aspx).
I'm doing the same, but it's not the exact same game. The graphics are slightly better on the switch (specifically, the draw distance), the sound is a bit better and you can use the touch screen elements on the switch whereas they've been removed from the Wii u (hopefully though, the new updates will fix that though you must pay for them).
Thanks for the multiple downvotes despite the fact that they're supposed to be used for people that don't contribute to conversations even though I spent a lot of time and thought doing so taking the time to respond to people point by point (a downvote isn't for when you disagree, btw)... unlike you who only responded to two things in my post (and yet, I still didn't downvote you).\n\nAnyway, they're only alarming in specific contexts. Trying to wipe out a disease (and that's how it's classified) isn't a bad thing. I'm not for eugenics when it comes to race or sex or anything like that. I'm also very much in favor of SERIOUS punishment for killing children/babies.\n\nBut again, if I had to choose between saving a baby or somebody like you, I'd choose you every time.

Yeah, Crystal doesn't exude the masculinity associated with the character. If anything, he'd swap better with a neurotic Woody.
I know I'm late to the game, but I think it's important to realize that though consciousness is a *noun*, it's not a *thing*, rather, it's an *event*.\n\nAsking what happens to human (or any) consciousness after death is like asking, "What happens to a punch after it's thrown?" or "What happened to that song after the artist stopped performing it?"\n\nNothing happens TO these things, they're simply over.\n\n
I'd say the opposite actually in regards to The Shining. The book was just an emotional roller coaster whereas the film was filled to the brim with content placed in there by Kubrick who turned it into something like an art-house film (which is like the literary equivalent of literary fiction).
Care to disagree good sir/lady, but The Beauty of Being Numb IMO, is one of the most interesting pieces of art ever...
As I understand it, many of the "religious freedom" laws were originally passed for specifically this reason, to allow native people to use peyote, ayahuasca, etc. in religious ceremonies without fear from the DEA. Then the right-wingers got the idea of twisting them to mean it's OK to discriminate.
As far as I know, it always goes to the nearest dollar. For example, an amount of $51,688.32 goes to $5,1688.00, but an amount of $51,688.57 goes to $51,689.00.

He definitely has a lefty and very critical take on US history, but it doesn't mean its wrong. I really like how he focused on Wallace throughout the series, what a different world, for better or worse, we would have if he was president.

>Except it's wasn't. It was perfectly tasteful.\n\nI'm talking about the pattern in general. I started off my post by saying I didn't even know what Tracer was.\n\nAlso, being tasteful isn't a counter to being forced. It can be forced and still be tasteful.\n\nIt's also important to mention that saying, "except it wasn't" isn't a counter, it's the equivalent of "nu uh" and calling something tasteful is subjective.\n\n>The problem here is that plenty of people have subconscious anti-gay feelings, which are minor, out of their control, and does not make them bigots. These people are not consciously anti-gay, but they feel threatened when society does not acknowledge their subconscious feelings.\n\nThat's SOME of the problem, but another HUGE problem is people like you throwing other people in that category which only makes it harder for you to make your point.\n\nIt's very much like how all Trump supporters were ALL thrown in the bigotry pile. Sure, a lot, maybe most, were, but not all of them (and I say this as somebody that did not vote for Trump).\n\nBy making blanket statements, you're marginalizing a group with legitimate qualms which is, *really* ironic.\n\n>The idea of it being forced is just the perfectly natural response of these people to rationalize their subconscious anti-gay feelings with their conscious pro-gay thought.\n\nThis isn't a counter. Whether it's natural or not has nothing to do with anything. It might be a natural response for bigots, but it's also a natural response for people with legitimate qualms about how art is being handled in stupid ways.\n\nYour response didn't really counter anything I said. To sum up, it was essentially...\n\n1. Nu uh\n\n2. A subjective view on tastefulness\n\n3. An irrelevant mind-reading of people about their response being natural.
>Size doesn't make you a man. Attitude does.\n\nI think it's genetics actually...
>Debating on Shovel Knight or not since I've never played it.\n\nI feel the exact opposite: I HAVE played it and own it, so why buy it again? If anything, not playing it is the perfect reason to buy it.
I find the title, and the article itself, uses a poor case of mind-reading. It starts off by saying I'm not a number of things, but I never believed in those things in the first place.\n\nLike another person mentioned with Theseus' ship (and like a person mentioned that it's the design), I think of individuals as just a sum of recognizable patterns.\n\nIt's like a song or a play. I don't need to use the exact same instruments, pitch, tempo or arrangement as the original, but I can play Mary Had a Little Lamb and you'd still recognize it as such just like I can make my own production of Romeo and Juliet with different actors, sets and even dialogue from the original production and people would still recognize it as Romeo and Juliet.\n\nIn fact, as a mereological nihilist, I believe this is the case for the vast majority of things.
Great for you. Seriously. Unfortunately, a lot of people never mature past that phase.
>what arguments could be made as to why socialists shouldn't be vegans?\n\nI'm a socialist because I think it's a viable extension of utilitarianism which is a normative ethical principle that I've adapted by default out of convenience/function, but fundamentally, I'm a moral nihilist and am primarily concerned with beings capable of reciprocating within this social contract. There IS no rational argument why socialists shouldn't be vegans, but there's also no rational argument showing why they should be.\n\nI try not to do extra/excessive damage to animals (i.e., if we could synthesize tasty, healthy meat, I'm all on board and I'm for some things as well like bringing down factory farming), but given the moral-realistic implications in this post, I find it rather irrational.\n\nOr to put it more simply, no normative arguments can really be justified (they all fall victim to the is-ought problem), they're just aggrandized descriptions of our preferences... that includes arguments telling us we SHOULD be socialists.
Scott Smith v Pete Sell
Try reading some of my larger replies because I've covered this question already.
>That is a pointless statement. Avant-garde is a thing. Don't be a pedant.\n\nBringing up your irrational defense of forced with tasteful is not pedantry. Two separate things. You can be forced and tasteful.\n\n>Now you're just being so disagreeable that you're ignoring plain language to the contrary.\n\nSo another unsupported nu-uh.\n\nYou don't back up any of your claims. You just say things like, "Except it's not" and amend those claims with unrelated shit.\n\nThen you go on to mind-read entire groups of people... if you're saying you were wrong and that's NOT all people, don't blame me for you misspeaking and then trying to sound like it was just a matter of "plain language" (I'm pretty sure even plain language differentiates between words like some, all, few, none and most).
This is to be expected. The more you like something, the more it caters to your very specific tastes.\n\nThink of it like clothing: if you have friends that are generally your size, you can probably let them them borrow your pants or shirt. But if you try the same thing with a pair of pants or shirt you had specifically fitted for you by a tailor, the amount of people that these will fit is significantly reduced.\n\nThis is why a lot of musicians release singles that have a general mass appeal even though their favorite songs end up at the end of the album or something and don't get as much attention but are beloved by the hardcore fans.
Gotta make sure that none of the Czechs' checks bounce.

Hmm...Maybe if this is a PKD novel we're living in, somewhere I can find some sort of device or drug that allows me to get into a different novel.

> a governmental interest of the highest magnitude that cannot \n> otherwise be achieved without burdening the exercise of religion\n\nAnd that's the slippery part, right there. I suspect it will end up meaning that if a judge likes/agrees with a given violation, it will slide, and if not, you're in trouble. If you don't want to let the homos into your business, that's fine, but if you think smoking the marijuanas is a sacrament, well, you're just one of them dope-smokin' losers and your religious claim isn't "sincere."\n
I would suggest a completely different angle.\n\nChristians speak of having faith, and they speak of their religion as a faith. OK, fine. People have the right to choose faith if that's truly what they want. However, when "proof" starts to sneak into the arguments of Christians, they quite unknowingly put themselves in a bind.\n\nFaith is belief without evidence. I might *feel* that X exists--whether X is God, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, or Elvis--and if I really want to believe that X exists, that's my right (as long as I'm not being an asshole about promoting my belief or killing anyone over it). However, proof is an entirely different animal.\n\nLet's just say for the sake of argument that the Bible really is proof of God's existence. That sounds great on the surface, but proof is all about *evidence*. Once I decide I have proof of something, I can no longer have faith in it, because proof completely does away with the need for faith. I don't need "faith" that I am sitting in a chair in front of a computer typing a message which I will post to Reddit, because I see plenty of evidence. I don't need "faith" that the speed of light in a vacuum is what it is, because countless peer-reviewed tests have shown us, to a reasonable margin of error, what that is. Same thing for the earth being an oblate spheroid, human-made climate change, the freezing point of water, etc., etc.\n\nMost Christians will say "Aha! But you must have faith in the scientists then!," but that's not faith either. The scientific method is a way to find out what operations we can perform that, within a reasonable margin of error, will produce consistent and repeatable results that allow us to make pretty good guesses about the world in which we live. Even aside from the strengths or weaknesses of each, faith and reason are simply not the same thing.\n\nSo, rather than saying one cannot use the Bible as proof of the existence of God, I would recommend explaining that the very fact that they would need proof is an indication that their faith is not as strong as they think it is. If their faith were really unshakeable, it could stand on its own.\n\ntl;dr -- Faith is belief without evidence. If someone needs proof of something, they don't actually have much faith in it.\n
That almost has a Trumpian ring to it.\n\n"I win so much, even when I lose, I still win! It's true!"\n
[...and a nice Chianti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Ptctl5_qQ)
Not a math teacher, but I helped to encourage a friend's six-year-old son to work on his math, reading, etc. His father would often pretty much just scream at him, "Do your work! Do your work!," and this was getting nowhere. The kid loved to go to Six Flags, so I said this to him one day.\n\n"Look, dude. I don't like how you get screamed at, but I do agree you need your math and reading and all that stuff. It's like this. Let's say you want to go to Six Flags one day, just you and your friends. Well, you need your math to figure out how much money you'll need, for gas and tickets and food and all that junk. You'll need your reading so you can read all the road signs. You'll need your geography so you can understand a map and know how to get there. I know right now it seems like school is a way that evil adults can torture kids all day, but all the stuff you're learning now will help you do what you want later."\n\nHe didn't magically start doing better in school after that, but he did quit getting upset when it was time for me to help him with his homework.
It's really quite simple. You haven't given *yourself* permission, and in this society there is still a lot of conditioning that says "non-monogamy = cheating." Even if it's not true, there's still that little voice that says it is.\n\nTo be honest, reasoning with that little voice is futile. It's going to drone on and on about how "bad" you are until you get fundamentally tired of it being there. One thing that may help though is to include more non-mono folks into your social circle (whether or not sex is involved). The more happy non-monogamous people you have around you, the more their happiness, which you'll see right in front of you, will make that little voice seem silly, more than any logical argument ever could.\n

Donald Trump always sounds to me like he's got an insane [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) text generator in his brain, pretty much just like the one used by /r/SubredditSimulator.

I wonder if a division such as this would necessarily follow state lines exactly. For instance, the culture of northern Virginia is a bit different from the rest of the state, and it could even be argued that western Virginia is different from central Virginia.
While I do have a problem with distance vision--My left eye is at about 20/200, and my right eye is at about 20/600 at best--I find that my biggest issue when dealing with traffic is that I have what amounts to tunnel vision. I have to make damned sure I've checked all possible sources of oncoming cars before I step off the curb, and this involves lots of head-swiveling. Imagine trying to cross a street with a barely translucent patch over your right eye and a toilet paper tube attached to your left eye, and that's about what I have to deal with. You can see the cars, but you end up having to double-check everything to be sure you know what's where.\n
Woah! That's freaky!

Sanal Edamaruku really knows how to flush the bullshit.\n\nDuring a debate over the effectiveness of magical powers on daytime TV in India, a "tantrik" claimed to have the power to kill any person within three minutes using only his magical powers, and Edamaruku [challlenged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Tantra_Challenge) him to back up his claim on live TV. The results were pretty hilarious and can be viewed in a two-part video ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmo1a-bimAM), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpwCuv_izn4)).
You might want to check out [The Integral Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Integral_Trees), Larry Niven's novel which is set in a gas torus around a neutron star. It's not exactly a gas giant in the sense you mean, but there might be some good ideas there.
No, don't give a response (pressing Enter, clicking Yes or Next or whatever the positive response is), etc. It will just sit there. Forever. That's really what you wanted, right?
I think the problem you would end up having is that you'd always have in the back of your mind that you're working for someone who's doing things to which you object...by which I mean, you really have a moral problem with his agenda. It's more than just "Well, the higher-up is an asshole, but the job is OK." You could even be opening yourself up to more and more moral compromise as time goes on. Also, I'm not entirely sure he wouldn't fire his entire back-office staff one day just on a whim, because maybe his coffee is cold one morning or he decides someone's nose isn't quite brown enough so everybody's "terrible, just sad."

Definitely, we always extrapolate based on what's available to us at the time. Computers in 1950's sci-fi almost invariably are gargantuan masses of vacuum tubes, because that's what they had.

The intent behind my statement wasn't so much to provide the "best" reasons for anything directly. Certainly the kid wasn't going to live at an amusement park.

For all of those who think this must be a troll, there really are [people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhm7-LEBznk) who have trouble grasping the concept of unit conversion.
First of all, I'm sorry that anyone ever has to go through this. I've come to the conclusion that the "god" that most Christians worship is, quite literally, despair, jealousy, and fear. It doesn't just *cause* these things. It *is* these things.\n\nHer, um, logic (but not really) isn't even internally consistent. If she "prayed every day that [you] felt 'no joy and no happiness'," and yet still claims you're "so happy," then her own faith must not be very strong because clearly, even by her own logic (there's that word again), her prayers aren't being answered. Also, by being so preoccupied with what she sees as your "sin," she too is "embracing" it to the point where she must pray every day that you be punished for it ('cause, you know, God needs our prayers in order to punish people because otherwise he can't do it himself).\n\nI think your mother might actually be jealous of you. How dare you be doing well, moving forward with your life, and living in a stable relationship? You're supposed to be the *sinful* one! You're supposed to be *punished*! How dare her God not smite you down where you stand!? It's gotta happen some time! Right...? **RIGHT!?** Well, maybe if she prays just a *little bit harder*...Anything so she doesn't have to face her own problems.\n\nI hope eventually the denial runs out of steam and she can just see you as the human being you are. Until then, as you said, you don't need the drama and vindictiveness in your life.
It's punctuated and capitalized incorrectly, that's all.\n\n"You! Income will increase!"\n\n"Your will: Be successful in love."\n\nThe problem is that the first statement doesn't indicate *whose* income will increase, and the second one just tells you what you want, not what you'll get.\n
They could've mixed in some Altoids and called it Feel the Bern.
I wonder how this happens.\n\nI'm guessing that **NO? ?? ???????** was supposed to be **NOT IN SERVICE**. Buses are one of my main modes of transportation and I live in the DC area, so I'm pretty used to seeing out-of-service messages, but I wonder how some of the characters transformed into question marks.\n\nMy inner geek thinks maybe some of the characters in the message string got clobbered by something else going on with the bus's embedded system code, but that's a half-assed guess.
All simultaneously? Damn, that *is* some efficient use of energy.
As a corollary to this, the decimal equivalent of a fraction will only terminate if the prime factorization of the denominator of the fraction (in fully reduced form) contains only 2's and/or 5's. For example, 3/4 (= 3/(2 * 2)) and 3/40 (= 3/(2 * 2 * 5 * 5)) will terminate, but 1/6 (= 1/(2 * 3)) and 2/15 (= 2/(3 * 5)) will repeat.
Suppose someone told you they had a chronic pain. It's so chronic, in fact, that quite often the pained person bursts out, "**JESUS MOTHERFUCKING CHRIST, THIS HURTS! OH, FUCK THIS, MAKE IT STOP!!!!**" If you had some evidence that maybe the chronic pain was being caused by some difficulty, i.e., not someone just looking for attention, you wouldn't tell the person to shut up because they're bringing you down. You'd probably suggest that there's some help they need that they're not getting. Maybe all they need is an aspirin, or maybe they need immediate hospitalization, but either way, getting rid of the indicator of a problem doesn't solve the problem.\n\nNow, I tend to notice weird quirks in how things are phrased, so maybe this is nothing, but I noticed you didn't mention wanting people to know how you feel when you're happy. You only mentioned wanting others to know you're *unhappy*. So, please forgive me for asking some possibly dumb questions: Are you ever truly happy? When you have been happy, did you want people to know this too?\n\nI think it's possible that you have some underlying issue causing your unhappiness, and you're better off solving that than trying to "get over" talking about it. Maybe you need more people around you who are interested in your well-being than maintaining a fake positive demeanor.\n\n
Great video...and I guess Kermit will never ask himself, "My God, what have I done!?"
I can see lots of ways for this to happen, though all of them involve some out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n* O Great Lord Trickster, I realize there is a drought, but please bring a nice cool rainstorm that nobody expects, or help us trick the other village so we can steal their stores of grain!\n\n* O Changer of Luck, we are sailing the sea for many months now, and we are nearly out of food! Please, bring us some unexpected boon. Maybe a passing enemy ship we can pirate? For Your Glory of course...\n\n* O Chaos, please increase our enemies' confusion in the fog of war, that we may chew bubblegum and kick ass in Thy Holy Chaotic Name...and by the way, maybe make some bubblegum fall out of the sky while you're at it? 'Cause we're all out.\n\nAnd of course, when the Sly One fails to come through, "Oh well, Trickster moves in mysterious ways..."\n
OK, I can't resist. This is just too weird to pass up.\n\n1. Ask your Jewish friend to elaborate and explain how any of your hair or lack thereof is antisemitic.

Ask Derrick why he believes nipple hair to be poisonous, whether he believes any other body hair to be poisonous, and why most human bodies would grow hair anywhere if it were poisonous.\n\ntl;dr -- To both friends, "Just...why?"\n

The problem is, though, that for people practicing the brand of Christianity that's most responsible for the bill in question, the current sitting governors/rulers, particularly at the federal level, aren't "legitimate" because they don't hate the homos enough, etc. There's *always* wiggle room, even regardless of what the Bible actually says.\n\nThere are also plenty of [passages](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2011/08/the-wall-o-socialist-bible-quotes/) in the Bible that seem downright--*gasp*--socialistic. But none of these matter to someone who believes that Jesus hates the "welfare queens" just as much as their pastor says they should.\n
I guess there's always the possibility of a Catholic driving home after Communion, being pulled over and given a breathalyzer test, and saying "Well, officer, I was practicing my religion, so yeah, this doesn't count, right?"
China Mieville wrote a novella called [The Tain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tain_%28novella%29) that is a bit like this, but in reverse.

I like the rescue mission for Quark's mom. Thought that was hilarious.
awesome! do you draw with a pencil before you paint or just go with it?
So, your question is really more like "What if we could use energy with 100% efficiency?" I'm definitely not a physics expert, but I think the problem we'd need to solve has to do with the [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics). Among other things, this law implies that energy is just going to dissipate over time, because that's just what energy does.\n\nSuppose we have some system, such as your example of a perpetual mobile. We'll call that System A. We want to stop the dissipation of energy from that system, so we create another system (System B) that does this. The problem is, energy in System B tends to dissipate too. No matter how many layers we add, even if each layer is more efficient (C more efficient than B, B more efficient than A, etc.), the laws of thermodynamics can't just be switched off. Just because of how the universe works, we'll never achieve 100% efficiency.\n\nAll that being said, there's a difference between relative and absolute efficiency. Suppose we have a system that is only 15% energy efficient. If we can increase the efficiency to 30%, we've just made the system 100% *more* efficient than it was before, in proportional terms (because 30% is proportionally 100% more than 15%, even if it's only 15% more efficient in absolute terms). The laws of thermodynamics don't prevent huge leaps in efficiency. They just mean that we'll never get all the way to 100% absolute efficiency.\n\nSo, let's say we can use energy so efficiently that, though it's still not 100% efficiency, is high enough that we can, for instance, have some device that we can just always plug into and have *virtually* unlimited--if not *absolutely* unlimited--energy to charge our phones, cars, houses, etc. There are already [atomic batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_battery), generally used to power satellites and space probes, and I see a lot of articles claiming that they may have consumer-level applications but I'm not sure how much of that is practical and how much is hype. I'm also not sure how safe this would be.\n\nIf there actually were a safe, practical, and scalable device that would give us virtually unlimited energy--some kind of ultimate battery that would "never" run down, i.e., maybe not *never ever*, but never within a lifetime, or at least several decades--then the next problem we'd need to solve would be limited raw materials, rather than limited energy. However, it would definitely give our technological progress a boost.\n\ntl;dr -- We won't ever have 100% efficient energy use, but that doesn't mean we can't make big leaps in efficiency.\n
Hey, stop casting aspersions on his [asparagus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE4fCcsw6Fs)!
Wow. Nostalgia time. I used to have stacks of Byte Magazine, including this one. I recognized it immediately, but I don't remember what the featured article in that issue predicted. I remember reading lots of books and magazines about computers in the '70s and '80s. While I don't remember which specific predictions I read where, I have the sense that a lot of them actually underestimated how much the technology would progress.
The Federal Trade Commission's [Complaint Assistant](https://www.ftccompllike taintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1) seems like the right place.
Oh, sure it is. But I was just pondering the fact that the year is the only unit of time we generally *do* make a big deal out of, as a society, simply because it is the unit of time that it is. I could have as easily said "Happy new..." week, month, four point two day period, hour, etc.--and for a lot of people, those periods of time would be an equally valid "big deal." As I understand it, there are people dealing with very difficult life circumstances for whom every day is a big deal, and I'm sure not going to argue with that.

Just a quick note: I went with the title of the article as it appears. However, to be fair, I'd say this bill would technically allow discrimination based on any religious grounds, Christian or otherwise.

As for learning Serum specifically, there's a shit-ton of good tutorial videos on YouTube. I've found it fairly easy, but then I've had some experience with other synths and know the basic idea.\n\nIf you're generally new to synths, I'd recommend starting with getting a handle on the different types of waveforms (saw, square, triangle, sine, etc.), noise "colors" (especially white, pink, and brown), and synthesis methods (additive, subtractive, FM, wavetable, granular, etc.). There are some videos that cover this also. Many of them will be focused on a specific synth, sometimes Serum and sometimes others, but the basic principles are applicable to almost any synth.\n\nIt's like cooking. Once you know the basic principles, cooking in an unfamiliar kitchen is just a matter of learning where the ingredients and tools are kept.\n\nKeep learning. I started learning Live and some VSTs in 2011 and I still feel like a noob sometimes.
I knew I'd see a Fairfax Connector in here one of these days.
I can't speak for others, but I take a middle ground on dream interpretation. I don't buy the idea that certain dream elements must always symbolize the same thing (or anything at all), but I also think our dreams can point to things that may have more personal meaning than we thought.\n\nMaybe you saw someone who reminded you of your college crush, or maybe you had an experience that reminded you of your college days. It could've been anything, maybe something on the periphery of your awareness (e.g., "Hey, that pizza smells just like the one I was eating when I met Sexy Person..."). Maybe it was just a random memory. Or, maybe you miss your crush, or something about your crush.\n

Occasionally though, I've had people inch-inch-inch up and actually bump into me, so when I see a car sort of halfway into the crosswalk, I usually stop for two seconds or so to make sure they're going to stay put before I just go on my merry way. My peripheral vision sucks worse than my forward vision.
Yes. I think Trump is gonna Trump, regardless of who he's up against.\n\nAgainst Hillary, it will be a stream of innuendos about Bill, Hillary's "wherever," and all the garbage for which Trump is infamous, with maybe a "Benghazi!" thrown in for good measure.\n\nAgainst Bernie, it will be references to hammers and sickles, "You know he did go to Russia once--but hey, I love Russia!," chest-pounding about how "great" capitalism is, etc.\n\nIn either case, Trump's entire schtick is mud-slinging. It doesn't matter who the target is.\n
To me, the novel was one of the most plausible stories about encounters with alien technology. None of it came with an owner's manual, or even much of a clue about its purpose. I hope the show lives up to the book.\n

And the "Satanists" are really doing the same thing, from a different direction. I think they're more mocking than whining. They're having a good laugh. Ask most folks who consider themselves "Satanists," and they'll tell you that they don't literally believe in Satan. He's like a cartoon character that they use to prove a point, i.e. that religion is used when it's convenient, and the BS about Christianity not being used by the state is just that--BS. But instead of whining that Christians should "get over" anything, the Satanists do their thing with mockery and a bit of trolling.\n
I live for [euphoria](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=euphoria) in its original sense of "condition of feeling healthy and comfortable."

You might find the [Gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) concept of the [demiurge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#The_demiurge) quite interesting. Briefly, many Gnostic Christians actually *did* consider the god of the Old Testament to be "wicked" (and if I'm not mistaken, there are still some people who are Gnostics, though Gnosticism has mostly fallen out of favor).\n\nSo, basically, if it turned out that there actually is a wicked god who created this universe, I'd probably attempt to find gnosis.\n

This will make America disintegrate again.
I am most definitely not a lawyer, but I would think what happens next would depend highly on two main factors: the outcome of the Congressional elections, and Trump's cabinet picks, particularly for the head of Homeland Security. If there are enough people who support his decision, it really won't matter what the Supreme Court says in the short run (see [Jackson's response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia#Jackson.27s_response) to the outcome of [*Worcester v. Georgia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia). If Trump doesn't have enough people supporting his decision, then as others have said, impeachment would probably ensue, or at least government agencies could refuse his order.
That's true, though I wonder how much longer the LDS Church will last anyway. I keep half an eye on /r/exmormon, as I have friends who are "TBM's" (true-believing Mormons), and...yeah, to make a long story short, there's a lot of internal dissent and it seems a lot of people are either outright leaving the church or going through the motions for the sake of family.
> MAN MADE TOMATO HUMAN MURDER\n\nHe's already ~~loose~~ LOSE, and he's running for President.
My experience is that Religion X--and let's not just pick on Christianity, because this goes for all of them--is whatever the prevailing norm among practitioners of Religion X says it is, even more than it is what the respective scripture says it's supposed to be. The more conflicting or unclear a scripture is on a given topic, the better, because then it's easier for fundamentalists to cherry-pick the parts they like and claim that references to the parts they don't like are "out of context."\n\nUnfortunately, the same holds true for conservatives who claim to "believe in the Constitution." Many of them just love the First Amendment, but they fail to understand that it isn't a free license to do whatever one wants in the name of their interpretation of "God" (who just happens to hate everything and everyone they do).\n
A couple of years ago, I had some ideas about turning some standard dystopian tropes in opposite directions, which I posted in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dystopianbooks/comments/26sqhv/unusualnonstandard_dystopian_scenarios/) comment over on /r/dystopianbooks. In summary, the ideas are:\n\n> * Technology is either forgotten or suppressed under so many taboos that it's made artificially scarce/difficult to use.\n>\n> * Social media is suppressed or abandoned for fear of lack of personal contact, which also causes alienation.\n>\n> * We become so afraid of privacy violations that the mere act of looking at someone is illegal, taboo, or otherwise frowned on.\n>\n> * Sexual desire itself is seen as so dangerous that it's considered dysfunctional.\n\nI would love to see Black Mirror tackle any or all of these.\n
**VIRAL PANIC ERUPTS IN MAJOR U.S. CITIES** *Experts claim "viral panic" is merely a reaction to media hype, blame "self-fulfilling prophecy"*
I think significance is relative.\n\nI have a friend who was in an accident that left him in a coma for a time. There was a little while that none of his friends were sure he'd make it. During that month, every day he remained alive was significant. Hell, the time the hospital determined to be "visiting hours" was significant. Fortunately, he did make a full recovery.\n\nWhat we define as a "year" actually is arbitrary. The Earth takes approximately 365.25 (plus some crazy number of decimal places) days to orbit the sun. In order for our Gregorian calendar to work right, we deem one year to be exactly 365 days, except every four years we tack on an extra day, and there's another rule when the year is divisible by 100. I'm not debating this. It makes sense for our pseudo-year to behave as it does, because it keeps us all relatively in sync. I'm just saying that it actually is a human construct for human purposes--just like the microsecond.\n\nMy point isn't even that every microsecond should be celebrated, or if it is celebrated by someone somewhere, that it should be done with a big ceremony. My point was more like, "Hey, I'm having a nice, chill microsecond right now, and I hope everyone else is too."

ring nebula is always cool, my vision has been going south so i cant make it out anymore :C
they are bff's for life! that last holo scene was really nice but i wish the finale ended with them fighting at the alamo or at least over Britannia in spitfires.

hes got orange hair too cant remember the name
great job! how long did it take you to master the piece?
Really interesting idea, wonder how Mace would look after being electrocuted and falling from a skyscraper. 
was just sitting on my roof looking at the milky way with my telescope in the window, really great stuff havent done that in like 4 years. Saw a beautiful shooting star dirty jers still got some good views left:)
yeah we all fucked
welcome to mars
pretty powerful stuff
welcome to college, you get a degree but you have to market yourself and pretend like you know what you're doing.

in amsterdam a couple of weeks ago my brother and i were walking back from the coffee shops at 1 am and met a guy along the way and as we were walking we asked him if he knew the song that goes,"naaaa Nana nananaaah, nana nananaaah, nana nananaaah, nanuh nana nuh". He did not know the name but sung it with us as we strutted down the avenue in the early hours of the morning. I hope he too found out the name of the song where ever he roams these day.
you have a very aggressive way of thinking 
That was great!
switched to geology today, get out while you still can friend! Unless you actually want to stay then follow your dreams!

doom 3 was great idk why it gets so much hate. That is the perfect containment breach game.
did he run in there with his dong already out of his petticoat
Reagan and Gorbachev could have really ended the Cold War together but he didn't want to lose his star wars program and look weak. His ego got in the way of progress.

yeah not everything has to be minimalist. NASA's work is bold,and does well with a strong flag
Hes an example of what happens when you neglect to compromise with 3rd party voters.  
It's probably Earth. There are amazing places off world, but none compare to our own!
but they werent at all important to the bajorian nor dominion arcs. It would be lazy writing if they shoe horn the greatest threat humanity has faced in for an episode or two with no lasting effects.
aerospace industry wants to make money by designing rockets. How will they ever make a profit if they already have a rocket design that can get us to mars???
Honestly its a  really touching song
sphs is good tho\n
imagine flying one of those babies irl hnng
oh no i mean there's a secret assassin program that would wipe out the top level of the exec board in case things get hairy
IBM doesn't have access to rocket technology, which is the biggest thing that the govt doesn't want falling in the hands of another country. Spacex does mainly govt contracted work so they work with nasa scientists and have access to that kind of restricted data.
i don't understand what you mean. Crime is the lowest its ever been, and radio waves are proven to not have an effect on the human body. There are more pressing things to worry about than that.
oh sorry i meant night vision just because of some meds, idk what id do if i couldnt see
got an A, basically did all the required posts i went all out for half of them and gave a sentence for the rest. Did well on all essays and quizzes except one i missed. Make sure you do everything on time, also the page tracks how long you've spent reading the articles so i left the window open for 5 min on every article posted, idk if that was factored into the grade but you can see that progress in the statistics bar. Overall made me truly appreciate art more since i had to search for paintings for the posts and i liked reading into them.
theres a problem of having sensitive govt data, like rocket blueprints coming into the hands of foreign governments. China and other countries like Isreal have done this in the past. That's why the US doesn't allow that. It makes sense imo
fuck u its sphs\nbuy now @ 4$ b4 aug 26 \ni got in at .90

No nigga you can find really nice stuff there affordably. when the OCBD's on clearance its fantastic.
there was a runescape quest where u had to fight a guy and you had to get a sexchange to defeat him in order to get the white knight armor. hmm
Yup dont get attached to your shares is the moral of the story
my first run as a 9 year old i guess i skipped through atris's dialogue and wound up a lightside sith and only figured it out when i took the temple of onderon. I don't think i killed the masters though.
wonder what would have happened if you went in?
trudge through the pain now and reach the stars tomorrow friend
thats very nice
Does make me a little nervous, but I'm gonna be hopeful on this one.
I don't think we're talking about those countries now are we? Picard is talking about the veil of justice that those power hungry demagogues use to cover their true intentions.
secksy.
Maybe some pictures would help?
To reiterate what others have said... \n\n$60k? \n\nNope!
IMHO the FW4 has the MFLB beat on stealth and versatility. I will grant you the warranty, but the year long warranty on the FW4 should be sufficient if any major defects were to manifest.\n\nI'm no MFLB hater, I've purchased a handful of accessories for it, trying to get the best hit out of it possible. I've used the techniques on r/mflbguide and I'm subscribed to r/mflb. And I do still use it, it definitely has its place.\n\nI'll stick to what I said though, when I first got the MFLB I was really looking for a FW4 experience.
Not a fan of Wheeler's vote here. He's starting to strike me as a little too pro-militarization of the police.
just get a 40oz and a freschetta...\n\nthen netflix and chill bro
love my Oregon homegrown. always looks 'alive' somehow. 
spam and popups all over this site on mobile
J. Taylor for starters.\n\nMaybe Powell when he was slumping.\n\nMaybe LB when we were struggling filling that slot?\n\nI thought he had good positioning though not incredibly fast, also thought he held his own well as a CB... not getting pushed around too much.\n\nWhen our backline was in disarray last season (all season?) I always wondered why we never saw him, assumed maybe practice wasn't going well or something...
Yeah, Millenials shouldn't be blaming GenX... good grief.
Good lord.\n\nno.
Take your politics out of here.
First thought is graphics card. What's your situation on that front?
Glad to hear you're still around and things are OK with Haze, and yourself!
yup!
I think you probably need to adjust your diet,  otherwise try a gas reducer. 
Madness.
yay! kites! 
Cool product, a bit much at $70. I think we need to see the cartridge market mature some before this gets a lot of uptake.\n\nI'm sure (and hope) that O2's carts work well with this, but I've yet to use a cart that I wasn't concerned about leaking.\n\nWe also need to have access to oil that we can use to refill the cart with... that doesn't need to be prepped into ejuice. This is coming form someone in a legal state and has yet to see oil that I could put directly into a cart.
dat carbon fiber hood tho /s
Starting to get excited to see how the new squad and formation rolls. \n\nDefinitely looking forward to seeing Chara getting more freedom to roam about!\n\nOnward!
A warranty would definitely make me feel better, the longer the better, but a year is reasonable. 
Finish a capsule?!?! hehheh... I get 3ish sessions out of a capsule (3-4 hits each time), on 2nd level heating.\n\nDifferent tokes for different folks I guess :)\n\nThat said, I could see knocking out a capsule if I wanted to get to a 10 post-haste.
How soon before it becomes 'Political Officer'?
fully agree
The FW4 is what I wish the MFLB was when I first got it.\n\nI just checked my FW4 delivery box, the only thing that indicates what's inside the box is the word "Firewood" in the return address field, other than that, it's a plain old box.\n\nI had it delivered to my work, no problem.\n\nYou'll be happy with a MFLB, but you'll be stoked with a FW4.
Maybe Rhythm Traders?
It's great.\n\nSmall learning curve.\n\nGet the 3 extra mouthpieces/capsules/holder thing.\n\nGet the cooling unit.\n\nGet high.
Ordain. Clarke was rocking 47.
been using this guy for 15 years -  http://www.bryanlaughlintax.com/ - and bryan helped us out of tough spot many years ago.\n\nhis rates are very reasonable. i know it's not in the city, but may be worth looking into.
I'm already a fan!
I was leaning towards him, just because I thought he was a bit of a card... also hoped maybe there was some chemistry between him and Liam.
I'm sure I'll be fucked either way.
I was a bit sketched the first time I saw him play, but he has definitely shown well since.
Yup, even if SS is saved, it probably won't be viable until near the end of the millennial generation collecting or after... IF!
Makers... nice :)
ah, so it does... thanks.

Yes! \n\nI've had mine for a few months now, and I just started packing it the way it says in the instructions, using the capsule like a straw... much better way to pack than the various shovel methods I was using.\n\nI use the second power level and get decent hits, though I'm not chasing clouds. I find that the straw starts to get a bit hot on level 3, and only turn it up to 3 at the end of a capsule.\n\nI'd say the cooling using is definitely worth it, as is the 3 capsule pack/holder.\n\nDon't try to take big rips at first, if you've ever pulled off of MFLB I'd say it's similar to that except you don't have to sip... just a nice long slow draw. Also, when you get that fist buzz, pause a beat or two for the capsule to heat up. The FW4 continues to buzz occasionally while on, and I've yet to determine what the buzzes mean definitively, but I usually pause a little after each buzz and let the capsule heat up again. Whether there's a rhyme or reason to that, I don't know, but it seems to be working.\n\nGet an extra battery too.\n\nIt's a great vape, enjoy!
fanning the flames now :)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChrisRifer/status/822530280846192640
Glad we kept at it.
I follow MLS... PTFC!\n\n:)
RE: Using with glass. If you remove the cooling unit, the rubber capsule top will fit a 14mm connector.\n
Thanks!
Dude, there are some haters here. It's a decent convection vape at that price, it's just an older style. Probably a knock off Vapor Brothers.\n\nJust grind up your herbs, draw them up in the whip, take a hit, and you'll be fine.
seriously. our midfield is looking stellar. glad to have blanco here, and guzman as well.
oh man. take your upvote.
They do compliment each other well. I think of the FW4 as a more discrete vape, that I can take a quick hit off of and get on with whatever. I usually use the Lotus with my bong, and it's capable of very big rips, which I'm not confident I could pull off with my FW4.\n\nIn essence, the FW4 has become my 'everyday driver', and I'll use the Lotus on weekends and whatnot. They both are really great vapes, and I'm glad I have both.\n\nheh. just noticed it's cake day. yay! :P
So... I'm gonna ask it.\n\nHindsight being what it is, should we have kept either of the Taylors?\n\nGiven the two... well I just don't know which I would have preferred :/
do you have a lotus to throw against these as well? curious how it stands up against the new breed of butane vapes.
Good luck Peay, thought you deserved more of a shot here than you got...
I don't think I saw Olum have a successful pass last night, it either rolled off into nowhere or ended up at the feet of RSL.\n\nOrdain was much better in the RB slot.
and the only non MLS player???
Try to get your health sorted for a few weeks, and if you're still having trouble, then yes, go see a GI doc.
I'm tired of coming home from work to everybody arguing.

Super awesome! Glad to see this community rock some positive vibes :)\n\nAs others have mentioned this sub is one of the few that keep me on reddit.\n\nGood work boys and girls! 
Initially the colored ones were $199, but yeah $100 for this vape was very reasonable... $130 isn't bad, but...
ZOMGZOMGZOMGZOMGZOMGZOMGZOMG!!!!!!CAPSLOCKELEVE!!1!1!1111
Lovely... what kind of tuning does it have, or can it have?
Yeah, that's what I'd thought too. So who knows?
2 senators per state, not 4. but yeah, it is a problem. 
Would love to see this.
Seriously, I had a nurse let me 'ride' for a bit before putting me under.\n\nMuch, much, much better than having to prep for a colonoscopy... :/
I think a system of levers and pulleys would be best to cross the Columbia... or maybe a catapult. 
Looks a lot like Googe Play Music, but with different colors.
1. we bring back melano, after selling adi in the summer\n2. guzman takes over free kick duties ( i want to say barmby but he's not a starter... yet?)\n3. valeri gets the armband
imzy doesn't seem that way
Not that brand, but yes, I've used carts many times. Expensive, but the most discreet method for vaping I've come across.\n\n100% solvent free though? Would like more info on that...
I think I'd rather have Valentin that Ordain...\n\nNot sure what's going on with Zemanski, though he did better in his last outing.
Huh.... will be interesting see Mattocks on the point.
It seems like they are back - http://alfavaporizers.com/shop/ - for awhile the black one was only $99, and I was very tempted, but I'd just ordered the FW4 and prefer on demand so didn't pick it up.\n\nIMHO the price is still very reasonable, and if I did pick up a session vape, I'd be giving this one another look.
Setting some reasonable expectations there.
THCF (or whatever they are called now) used my records for 3 years, but it's possible the rules have changed.
Yup!
Good lord thanks! I just got TA tickets today and won't make it home to ditch it... leave it at work it shall be!
wow, that sounds really sketch. 
Can he play CB? Didn't he use to play LB? Just kinda spitballin' here...\n\nI got some feels for ya RodWall. Good luck.
Definitely looks boxier.
Honestly... kinda bummed on this one.
Honestly sounds like some weak herb.
This is true, every time I've come back to it, and gotten my technique re-sorted... it can get me up there. It's very sneaky too. I usually just sip off of it, and those sips can be a bit disingenuous in what they are delivering :) 
I get the chewable tablets. I do try to take them before I eat and they are more helpful when you do, but I do find them helpful after eating as well. In a Tums, but not Tums, sort of way.
you may want to have a look over at r/concentrates
I want Drunk Uncle's take on Trump!
well it's probably not the best time of year to sell a bike... but you could always consign it at sellwood cyclery 
I finished a grind I used for my MFLB in the FW4 and it was definitely too dense, so don't use the Finishing Grinder. \nNo idea how the Space Case grinds, I used to flip my 4 piece grinder for my MFLB, but don't do that anymore for the FW4. I imagine the Space Case by itself will be fine.\n\nThe draw speed is similar to the MFLB, maybe a tad bit stronger, but you don't have to sip. I'd start with a MFLB draw (no sipping!) and go from there.\n\nIt also only smells a little bit more than the MFLB.\n\nThe FW4 is a great vape, it's everything I wished the MFLB was. No idea how long it'll take to get to r/straya, but you'll love it when it does.
sigh.
yeah, that lotus dropdown is nice. i got a drop down for mine when i started using it w/ my bong. almost a must have, got to keep that heat away from the face.
so.... /s ?
They look like fun.
Great read... does well to note Nagbe's contributions.\n\nSome nice clips too!
nope. depth tho...
We really should retire this fucker
Just the sheer arrogance might have done him irreparable harm here....
Disappointing that the voters didn't know how to deal with his distraction tactic. Bernie Sanders is not relevant when the topic is "why won't Joe manchin do a town hall?" But they let him steer the conversation and now that's the quote. Something off topic and intended to distract West Virginians from the fact that they have two republican senators.  
Thanks Obama
You did not accurately portray the conditions and segments of the economic class system.\n\nMaybe you can provide a source to show the numbers you mentioned are even accurate.
Gonna miss him
I'm sure for heterosexual females they would be better.
We've seen a village in Dolores/Maeve flashback and a burried church in the present.\n\nIsn't the village buried while she is with William?\n\nPerhaps I have not been paying close enough attention to the detail there and I could go back and look. 
I'm speculating because I sort of think the explanation fell on the cutting room floor.\n\nBut I think Mom showing Dad the letter drove a deep wedge between them. Meanwhile OA had told her parents the story. Ordinarly Mom would have been freaked by this and Dad would have had Mom's back. \n\nBut I suspect that Mom has left the household. We don't see her after the waffle thing.\n\nDad is free to be more sympathetic and open to OA's arguments. In the moment he senses that something is "true" about her urgent needs and he's been softened up due to the Mom stuff. \n\nSo he lets her go. But he does evaluate the situation when she says she needs to go.\n\nI sort of think the ankle bracelet is a family thing via mental health services rather than a court mandated thing. No reason she can't leave the house "legally". \n\nBut again this pure speculation and if I got any facts wrong please correct me. I'm just working from memory only seeing the episodes once.
joint got zucker'd
It was mentioned on cbs this morning on monday's segment about the show. 
She punches meg the fuck out but then stumbles over meg's leg and falls down breaking her arm. \n\nJK I am so excited for this show to be back!
Oh well maybe it's personal then. 
We hardly need another one. The last one pretty much destroyed humanity and made the planet unihabital for people.\n\n\nWe do not need any more free market ideologues.
Oh I'd still vote for dems for elected office if the race is tight. I'm not going to vote for republicans.
I think it's a fair question but I have no doubt she's real.  Mainly because of the her activities in the abscence of david.
Never realized that was her
It's just important to remember when criticizing the dems. 
They could never publish in scientific journals. But a book deal might be possible. Still they'd be ruined. \n\nIt doesn't add up. But it's in a fictional world. The rules could be different.
I'm sorry I could not communicate my thought to you. Lets just move along.
Finally
Willful ignorance is a serious problem in sectors of the population.\n\nYou've heard the dogwhistles regarding trumps deportation programs.\n\nYou know trump travel ban is called a Muslim ban.\n\nAnd those are just the most glaring examples.
okay
We won the popular vote by a significant margin
I had hoped that I was the only thing in the world that could satisfy her. \n\nFML
Sentient means ability to perceive and feel. \n\nonce the switch is flipped they are sentient. Programming does define the parameters of it. As it does with human beings or goats. \n\n\nThe only variable is the source of the programming.
Not the show. People on campuses, on the internet, in cafes and behind the doors of their homes.\n\nBut it's also worth remembering this is based on a biography of Zelda.
If he is it's a baby daddy type thing. Don't feel he lives with his family. But he's also a responsible baby daddy who is giving sufficient money and time to his kid or kids.\n\nAll that is based entirely off intuition. 
I think it's maybe influencing your thinking on this point. \n\nBut you could be right.
Okay. That's hard to discern tho.\n\nI agree with a critique on our offense but not putting much of the blame on Trevor
Political Correctness is awesome.
>There must be something to it...\n\nOn its face the tweet is about renewal isn't it?\n\n\nSo it doesn't gurantee that this rachel thing is true.\n\nI agree it looks like her and could be very revealing. But I am a null hypothesis type so I need stronger verification. I certainly can't tell if it's rachel or an extra.
The cbs report indicates that there's a character return twist.  I am thinking they did the bombing. But I can't think of who it could be.
In marx the capitalist phase is necessary. Its just not the final stage of economic development.
Jack seemed to protect and defend her as opposed to her mom. And mom already asked kate if it was her fault.  Maybe the abscence of Jack's self esteem boosting contrinuted along with grief.\n\n\nI doubt,at this time, she is responsible.
aboriginal rampage?
That's a better discussion to be having
So old billy could do something barbaric\n\nI'm guessing that plot changes reframed this to make it so pointless
Why wouldn't one way of understanding your past be to read books about it?
We don't know what they did. But I understand that this sort of thing is a big deal financially.  And also very rare.
Dingo attack.
Excellent clarification
hmmm did your mom have an elaborate snake tattoo all over her body?
I'm not talking about stealing her writing.\n\nI'm talking about a tendency today for people to judge people that lived decades or centuries ago by the same standards of behavior that are acceptable today. \n\nI do not come away from this show feeling that Scott is a horrible monster.
Until that account is verified I ain't dancin'.
Do you watch mr robot?
The sprawl.
Perfect attitude.
Even when he's sure something might "leak"?
The fbi lurking seems entirely logical to me. By the rules of conventional tv which are also fake.
I listened on my home shelf stereo system connected to my computer with a dac. It sounded fine. \n\nI just use the rss feed in foobar.
you keep it off to the side and if something gets on it you clean it.\n\nit is enjoyable and efficient. 
thanks keep us updated
Thank you for the highlights shows how artful this work is. Can't wait to listen to the whole thing.\n\n\nI'm even more pleased there's more to come.
we did win the popular vote. 
Dude would overpay by at least 25%
Me too I'm a never patrioter
she can do so much better.
We should and probably will be able to carry each other. Unless you are a media or political professional you can take a break or dial your news consumption back.\n\n\nI did so for a couple of weeks.  I read headlines not articles and consciously did not post in political threads. Finally I only watched or listened to news media if something big happened.\n\nThe resistance movement only grew larger while the dial back made me stronger too.
Saw the author on CNN. He spoke truth.
If any democrats vote yes for her I will leave this party. 
They can prosecute her. Double Jeopardy doesn't work the way you describe. 
GOD SAVE THE WADE!\n\n
You do not want president pence.\n\nIf you want to help join the trump resistance movement. Write your electedd officials about every issue.
I would like more overt leftist propaganda on television. \n\n
you're right. I meant to be humorous.
definite hyperbole on my part.
Sure. Especially if you read mostly for fun.
cause william starts a company called delos.
so we beat on boats against the tide....
okay I'm dancing
I think it's mostly an internet thing where obnoxious behavior is pervasive and exaggeration and hperbole infect communication.\n\nI like or love most jambands too. Don't let it bother you op.
Thanks I think we all recognize the tenuous grasp on reality possessed by the conservative ideologue.
Okay so now Trev has to be superior to Peyton Manning?\n\nCmon no qb is as good as peyton. He is one of the greatest of all time.\n\n\nDilfer won a superbowl how does Trev compare to him?
Is it okay if I enjoy it despite the fact that ai isn't remotely my thing. In fact I'm not really into sci-fi generally.
I don't see how or why. 
cause it's not a popular opinion.\n\nInternet is internet.
Hahaha you think that line works?
Can you support your assrrtion about comfortable middle class life for the majority
lol you creepy stalker. My bronco bonafides are unimpeachable. 
This is a bummer. This story should be told. Executives suck.\n\nAll power to the people.
Boycott will work
I suspect laura and maddie will be in the lodges and perhaps make spirit appearances to coop and others
I do not believe for a minute they are engaged or getting married.
just stop.
I was thinking more about Dolores killing Arnold after reaching a level of self awareness in her path to the center of the maze.\n\nBut I was curious to see if other applications of the ideas might be made by more brilliant denizens of this sub.
Kept anything I would want to save. Donated a bunch to NOLA post Katrina and donated some more to prison.\n\nGot to deduct them from taxes and it was easy and efficient for me. The used book market seems to be really dead and hard work.
What happened to Meredith?
I think that's a different question worthy of discussion.\n\nBut on the criteria of intent and also "this would insult me, if I were called this". We collectively insult them plenty. \n\nAlt Right is scum tho.
Well it's part 1 of the process actually.\n\nPart 2 is driving too fast in the residential areas to get the wind force to blow the rest off.\n\nlol a+ thread.
We insult them plenty.
After we were out I was hoping they would all the way to the superbowl. So I'm bummed.
I'm loving this show and it's very cool to have it from Zelda's POV.\n\nI didn't read the thread but I feel Gatsby is perfect for High School.\n\nAnd I think FSF is a great writer who is human and existed in a specific time.\n\nI can't condone excessive ahistorical political correctness. 
He probably should shut up now.\n\nHis kind of corporate serving, minority scapegoating democratic politics gave the trump crowd a lot of ammo.\n\nthat kind of democratic party should be a thing of the past.
Did she fulfill her purposes tho?
No. The correct choice is not listed "boycott her until you bankrupt her"
oooh no some of the worst offenders are natives.
It's pretty deep and cool the way I look at it.
I just think he dies drunk driving out to the cabin.
he got back to safety and was clothed. Then he went back to reality and went to war with william in the business world.
Thank you mods for everything.\n\nGonna be another interesting off season. 
It's common for people held captive to miss out on escape chances. It's part of the trauma.\n\n\nAlso this show,like life is full of logical holes.
EXACTLY ! This is what I thought I would hear a conservative say... and my bleeding liberal heart respects you for it. 
Unless they are the losers, in which case, losers read Dr. Seuss and prevent the winners from making policy.
Hey! Thanks... this was a really persuasive case you made. I think, ultimately, history will be the judge of all things, and I hope your assessment (as well as a lot of the folks here) proves to be correct. \n\n
I totally have...but I cant stand the thought of him gloating because he got Mitch fired. \n
This confuses me...
Its almost like all that stuff she says is political theater, but not a core belief she isnt willing to compromise on....
To be fair...Clinton ought to be on that list too.  He famously said he and not Dole , was the law and order candidate .
Also... to be fair, the optics of a private server are worse... it demonstrates that you potentially want to hide business from the government servers. And all of her aides pleading the fifth was pretty damning. \n\nThat said... ooooh Mike Pence... you dun fucked up real good. 
Finally, this sub has a more reasonable stance on Randle. I've been pissed off by his garbage defense and attitude for so long. There is no denying he has the talent to run the floor, and that is valuable at his position. \n\nBut the rest of his play is garbage. Larry Nance, a player with far fewer natural talents is a significantly better player right now. \n\nI still think it's too early to say Randle is a bust, but for the love of god, no lakers fan should be delusional enough to think he is the savior of the franchise. 
Lol wut ...
I think rich people always need more money 
You're probably right... 
So.... Kobe confirmed?
But... the point is to make the WH use as political capital as you possibly can... again, by pressuring your representatives for answers, and constantly letting them know that you're paying attention, eventually, there will be a straw that breaks the camels back and congress will not be able to justify their support to the administration. \n\nIt may not be this one, but all these go into a list, and we need to keep bringing up these issues. \n\nJust think back to the kind of crap the republicans pulled in defiance of Obama... from not allowing Garland a hearing to reading children's poetry in the house... Dems need to take a clue. If I don't see the faces of Pelosi, Schumer, Warren, Sanders and the rest on every god damn news show for the next 48 hours ... they are failing the public. \n
This was a nice start to my morning...
He was locked in... even when switching on D. Got to give credit where its due.
> Carlson asked a legitimate question - what proportion of the climate change we're seeing is caused by anthropogenic CO2 output?\n> \n\nAhh... wise words of one George Carlin. 
He avoided alternative lies... so you have to give credit where its due
HAHAHA... thats what Magic keeps calling him :). Magic is silly.
Hi...\nI have a couple of really stupid questions here. I have done a little bit of wide angle landscape astro, and I was thinking about getting a telephoto lens and a skytracker. I was just curious... how do you decide what is a good zoom to work with. Is it a bad idea to try and get a fast, telephoto prime lens ? \n\n
Gun laws... I used to believe that there ought to be no guns at all, but sane right wingers made me realize that will not happen and need not happen. \n\nI'm also conflicted about a specific issue about LGBT rights... with the furore about the lady who refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding. I thought that was ludicrous at first, but someone asked me "are you not asking them to compromise on their religious beliefs by asking them to bake a cake for a gay wedding". I see some trouble there... like what if someone's religion tells them not to serve black people food, or something stupid like that. But it made me question my stance. \n\nAlso, I can listen to folks like Ron Paul and see a lot of logic in their stance, because it emphasizes a non-interventionalist foreign policy.\n\nOther issues : I used to be more of a leftie, but I recognize that capitalism is the smarter system in many respects... however, I still believe that what we practice is a form of risk-free capitalism for the rich. If you are truly a capitalistic society, you should not be bailing banks out. \n\nPolitical correctness: My right wing friends believe that they get shut out of conversation when they are at the workplace, which is a highly liberal environment. They feel alienated, and judged for airing right wing opinions. I can see why they would feel this way, and I sympathize somewhat. 
Yeah that is infuriating... they keep saying "we need more competition in the insurance marketplace"... well that's what we had before Obamacare and that shit doesn't work. \n\nI'm not a fan of Obamacare, and I would rather see a public option, but the logic that completion will make rates go back down is demonstrably false! 
Great article ... thanks for sharing 
Why? I'm just asking... I don't know enough about either of them to comment 
They were just jokesters to be frank... they called DLo a bust after summer league and said we should have drafted Mudiay. They also lobbied aggressively for Byron to coach the lakers and then dissed him 10 days later... \n\nThe fact is, very few serious sports analysts will captivate the audience or fill 24 hours of air time, so they need to find entertainers. And that's what I think these guys are. It's just Max and Marcellus didn't take themselves so seriously... SAS has a really elevated opinion of himself. 
Box out ? Set screens ? They don't keep stats for that
:)
I see the sense in that logic :)
HRC played that game better than anyone else... heck... she invented the game, and still lost to the worst candidate ever.
Ohhh shheeeeeeiiii
Yeah... that is my opinion as well. 
More parallels to come ... oh god no
This is part of his plan to MAGA... a time when dial up was the best we had, and a great american company like AOL was a world beater. 
:)
... and they're fired ?!?!?
fox is the voice of reason when compared with infowars, breitbart and drudge.\n\nI'm glad to that the "fake media" has gotten their collective heads out of their asses though... all the big outlets, CNN, WaPo, the failing NYT... they have done a good job the last 6 weeks and I must credit them for it. 
People are saying it ?
Give us ze money lebowski 
How do people know this... I'm so confused. How is everyone so god damn sure about this? 
I can't tell if you're serious.
> Apparently Magic has talked to him about his defence and has said to him that he see's potential in ~~Clarkson~~ Clarkston for that side of the floor, I think if he becomes an Avery Bradley-esque perimeter defender (I know, it's a bit of a stretch but c'mon let me dream) then I think he could def be our starting two and an above average player.\n> \n\nFTFY
Yup... every time I would lose my patience with him, he would have a game where he shows up on defense and doesn't ball hog. And then I'd get my hopes up. And then he will regress to his mean. \n\nAt this point, I think he will end up being a mid tier player who gets maybe 2 more decent contracts. He is still young, and he might prove me wrong, but I'd be willing to bet he's not going to be a perennial all star. 
My point here is that ... we don't know if trump is benefiting financially from this specific legislation . We do know that almost all the southern republicans most certainly are. 
Lol... I like that comparison :)
And Tarik!
Swaggy to the kids "Damn... guess I fucked up". Winks at Luke. 
This is not going to go down well... besides the absolute lack of morality in his position, does he not realize how awful the optics of this are .... its a terrible koolaid of arrogance and stupidity that the DNC have been sipping on
Because that is all he can do... hes a fine public speaker, no doubt, until the time you actually start listening to the words that come out of face hole.
It was a big disappointment... essentially they told the progressive wing to forget the primary and fall back in line because we need to fight trump.... I hear that strategy worked out pretty well in the generals. \n\nIf the party is truly looking to change, they need to learn from the clusterfuck of 2016. It should be a god damn case study. And asking people to "put the primary behind us" is not a good sign
You guys are the best !!
When he got elected, I remember the folks over at t_d were bragging about how woke they are... and if trump pulls any funny business, in cahoots with the "globalists", they would hold his feet to the fire...\n\nWell, he's violated every principle of fiscal conservatism and introduced legislation to enrich the wealthiest, at the expense of the weakest...get rid of the ACA, sure ... fuck over the EPA ... sure.. put more people in private prisons... sure ! 
What is this ... errr... "law" thing ?
does it even matter... everything he expresses is what is convenient in the moment.\n\nWhen kobe gets the 24 mil a year deal... shit all over mitch and jim. When Kobe scores 60 in his last game... talk as if you were responsible for his career. Nothing he says is is an honest opinion/sentiment. HE IS FAKE NEWS. 
Where can I see where my experience is?\n
Bringing it every night is the difference between pure talent and professionalism... Andrew Bynum had pure talent. Tim Duncan was a consummate professional. Yet, as a 17 year old kid, Bynum surprised Duncan with the things he could do on the court.... that was one game. Of course... their careers were ended up vastly different. 
This is a symbolic post... the only thing it does, is send a signal to the public. Is the DNC establishment going to follow the wishes of the people, or the directives of their donors. And no matter how much lipstick they put on this pig... they chose donors over masses. \n\nThey also flat out refused to reinstate the Obama years ban of taking corporate PAC donations.... so its actually pretty hard to argue the party is willing to change.\n\nPerez vs Ellison represented (once again!) a status-quo versus change. And the DNC proved to be entirely tone deaf.
The talent is there with each of these 6 kids... DLo, Randle, Zu, LNJ, JC and BI. \n\nThe trouble is, they need to know their roles on both sides of the ball. This is what impresses me about LNJ, and makes me want to scream at Randle, who often tries to plays hero ball. Last game was a fantastic example of all he can be in the league... he was keyed in on defense, and didnt try and dribble the ball past half court defenses, only to turn it over. Ends up with a superb performance.. not just from a stat sheet perspective...\n
He doesnt read this subreddit... I hope. But I have totally tuned him out. I no longer read crap he writes, or watch his videos, and I switch the channel every time hes on 710. \n\nAnd I'm glad Max Kellerman is on First Take now, because it makes it easier for me to ignore them both at the same time. Just another fast talking comedian pretending to be qualified to comment on athletes. 
OMG I know a trumper who loves the idea of MAGA. And gates of progressive policies. And he went to school on the GI bill. When I try to tell him that was a hotly debated progressive victory , I get the blue screen error on his face 
Well in their defense... they interpret their subreddit policies as implying that they want an echo chamber. It is a place for conservatives to discuss things -- you are not a conservative, so, adios. \n\nThat's exactly the message I got from their mod. 
Honestly ... the left sucks at crying foul. If we get fighters in the house instead of these corporatists, maybe something changes.  \n\nBut why are Pelosi and Schumer not yelling their heads off on every news network right now? Where are the op eds and the speeches and the grandstanding...  Make a fucking show out of it, and get some attention. If you want to be heard ... be bold. 
Just the irony of it all is pretty funny I think
I think there is a little more hope here... and that arises from 2 constituents:\n\n1- pissed off democrats/berniecrats who didn't show up to vote \n\n2- pissed of rural working class Americans who voted Trump as a "fuck you" to the corporate democrats. \n\nI think these people are not a blind cult of faith, and some of them will come around... I just hope the democrats find a way to reorganize around more worker friendly policies, instead of the nonsense neoliberalism we have seen since the mid 80s. I'm most worried about this last bit...
oh yeah... I'm convinced its all a mental thing with Randle. He is a very talented athelete, who can easily be a B+ player in the league. If he steps his effort up, I can see him doing even better, but he has shown no signs of ever being willing to step that effort up. \n\nHe refuses to play team ball, he wont set screens for others, he has trouble passing and gets "tunnel vision" because he is so fixated on making the hero play. \n\nBut this is a pro sport... you need to bring it every single night. Not just on nights where the atmosphere is charged with emotion/adrenaline. There have been many, many players with remarkable physical tools, who never amounted to anything close to their potential because of their mindset...\n\nThis is harsh, but my personal opinion, is that he is a selfish and lazy player. If he was playing with someone like KG or prime Kobe, or for a coach like Thibs or Pop... he would have been ripped to shreds. I hope he changes, because he has the tools to be an excellent player... just not the mentality.
Thats probably not even in the top 10 most idiotic things he has said.
It's totally possible... but when you deny incontrovertible facts, time and time again, you look more and more like one of the people trying to manipulate the masses to promote their own agenda....\n\nUnless of course, we are talking about a cult based on blind faith. 
Clearly, it's George Soros and the lizard people at work .... but the MSM doesn't want to tell you that 
Wait till he decides to show up again, and then all the Randle fanatics come out of the woodwork asking where the haters at...\n\nI don't think they understand how talent without consistent effort is worthless in this league . 
Build the mall !
looks like someone lit a fire under ju's ass. whatever happened... i hope he starts playing with this intensity every damn game. Not just his stat line... but I saw him engage on defense for real. 
reminds me of Enron ... borrow from the future, declare yourself so fucking rich that everyone wants to give you more money... borrow more money and call it growth
Fox news is turning against Trump? Since when? 
those are fake news...
You know, there's a reason European aristocrats developed weak chins...
I dont think it is necessarily a bad thing to call him out on his crappy play when he deserves it. \n\nEven Luke said.. he has not seen Randle keep focus and "stay engaged" as long as he did was able to today. 
Journalists and analysts with some pedigree and qualification are professionals. \n\nIf they put Shaq and Charles up on tv ... I don't care how silly and goofy they act, at least the understand the game. I don't think Stephen A would know a down screen if it hit him in the face. \n\nAnd his journalistic standards are awful... he's basically a glorified gossip monger. Look at what happened in the KD incident..
Thanks! I'm glad you're well educated on the matter and willing to share your perspective. This is certainly encouraging.
How do you know who was and wasn't instrumental ?
some asswipe tried to convince me that socialists lack a moral compass that, somehow, all capitalists are born with. He then went on to say that all tyrannies ever have been perpetrated by socialists. When I brought up the Nazi regime (very opposed to socialist ideas, despite the name), or the regime change in Iran at the behest of BP, or the East India company... he decided to ignore those. 
I dont trust Jeanie to be a good GM. Shes not at all a basketball person, and I always think back to the time when she ran that PR campaign to keep Dwight Howard in town.... that was really pathetic. I did not like seeing the "STAY" posters all over town, and it irks me to this day. \n\nThat said... her biggest asset might be that she isnt a basketball person, and she knows that and will defer to the opinion of someone wiser than her. Although Jim and Mitch have drafted reasonably well, they have obviously not kept the franchise relevant, and if it is time for a change... maybe a very hands off Jeanie will be fine. 
All of this would make more sense if it was coming from Pence/Sessions... I don't think trump cares about this issue. Does it help that he is screwing over people who didn't vote for him ... it probably doesn't hurt, but I doubt it comes into the picture. \n\n\nMoney is the main concern here... money from the private prison industry going to republicans. 
Love Huerts...
SAS symbolizes everything wrong with our society. \n\nA completely talentless man, who is wrong more often than he is right, has no athletic achievements in his entire life, gets to make millions upon millions passing judgement on actual athletes like KD who slog day and night to reach the epitome of their professions.\n\nHes not a "pundit", hes not an "analyst", hes not a "professional".... he is just a loud mouth with an opinion. So is my drunk grand uncle.... but he doesnt make millions for his "talents". Fuck Stephen A. 
That was one game which really shouldn't count when assessing a player. He played with mad effort, but he's never shown that he is capable of doing that regularly. \n
His statement under oath was about "any contact with Russian officials during the campaign" which was clearly false. That's flat out perjury and Sessions is a lawyer... he is supposed to know this is illegal. \n\nHow does anyone know, in what capacity did Sessions act during these interactions, campaign representative or legislator? If it was innocent, why not mention it during the hearings ?\n\nAnd I don't get the double standard... Hillary got a lot of shit (and rightfully so) for the CGI. She could have claimed that when she represented the CGI, those interactions with donors had no overlap with the State department. Would you have bought this defense , or would you be brewing up more Alex jones/ lizard /vampire / pizza related fan fiction ? \n\n
It's not like he's ever going to need Walcott in a title winning game ... 
I agree with everything you just said.... the only cause for optimism is this : Magic has personality and NBA cred like no other, and that means something the next time we are throwing a free agent pitch. \n\nAlso, the current FO was running low on ideas. Maybe a breath of fresh air will help. 
Thanks for the article... I just worry about reports like this. There were similar reports out when Flynn took over as well, and many people come out in support of these nominees. A lot of this, I believe, has to do with how the game is played in Washington.\n\nFor instance, this article lists a series of qualities that McMaster purportedly has... that he is "an erudite and charming student of history" (author's opinion), or a "widely respected combat leader and scholar" (Time Kane's opinion), a "straight arrow" (Thomas Donnelly's opinion). \n\nI dont know any of those people. And also, this is awful journalism. Instead, I would find it significantly more persuasive, if there was some description of his past actions which demonstrate these qualities. Or even a description of his view of world and America's role in it.\n\nIt seems that the highest concrete praise offered in this article, is that he wrote a good book and understands the military well. But at the end of the day, he is a Trump appointment, and I am not willing to concede to him the benefit of the doubt on the basis of book authorship. John Bolton has also written books.\n\nBut, I appreciate your linking the article. I'm sure I could dig into this more, and I might reach the same conclusion as yourself, but for now... I'm not sold.
Read this as "not going to get my herpes up"
Mr Carl's Jr. also withdrew his nomination... and a bunch of folks he tried to hire told him they would rather be on the right side of history ....
interesting... thanks for telling me this. This is all news to me.
Well bill Clinton wanted to privatize it. He had a deal with Newt Gingrich, but then Monica Lewinsky happened , and he lost the  political capital to push that through congress....
This was definitely the best defensive performance I've seen of ~~Clarkson~~ Clarkston
I was being sarcastic ... trump loves to call it that 
So, that was (of course) just my opinion. I do think both things are stupid and its hard to argue which one is stupider in a quantifiable manner. \n\nBut, my background is in the field of research, and even though the information I deal with is not classified, every time we work on projects related to national labs, there is strict training on data distribution and the appropriate protocol. One thing that is repeatedly emphasized is that everything I do is the property of the government federal agency I am working for. I can not stick a USB stick into a computer, and transfer a file, taking it home. The data is not my property, and I do not own the rights to it. \n\nI believe the situation is similar in other branches of government (again... not an expert, could be wrong). But the spirit of the regulation is to emphasize that nothing you do at work is your "property", and by working for the government, you are willing to cede that.\n\nIt bothered me that Clinton did not grasp this concept while working for the State Department. Running a private server did look a lot more like she was trying to hide something, and the CGI investigations are ongoing. The use of bleachbit, and her aides pleading the fifth all created a situation where it looked like there was a cover up operation of some sorts.... and as is the case with most crimes, the cover up is often more damning than the crime itself. \n\nSo, to compare Pence and Clinton, I think both actions created the same chance of causing real harm, but the Clinton situation had worse optics. \n\nI would also like to add... I am not a Trump apologist (if you get that impression), but I think being critical of your own ideology/party/self is a good habit. 
I think a lot of people watch him for that reason. The trouble is, he can influence public opinion. And that's what makes it possible for owners to make big changes. \n\nHe was vocal before the hiring and firing of every one of our coaches. He has been talking smack about this FO despite having no constructive suggestions whatsoever. It's so annoying that he gets millions of dollars to do this garbage. The whole episode with KD was another shocker...
German has some really specific words for the strangest things ....
totally... my particular comments actually had a handful of upvotes, and the dude who was offended by my questions was being downvoted (not by me)... so I'm pretty sure there are level headed folks I can see eye to eye with.
I remember how folks were so excited to see him play for a coach who knows what he's doing.... I guess this is a reality check! \n
Yeah.. I was bummed. I'm happy to share the exchange if you want. 
Two words : ice cream
I'm sure the people at the FBI love it when their boss goes on Twitter to rant and complain to the entire world about what a crappy job they're doing.
Are you implying our beloved American Government is a model of efficiency and a bastion of forward thinking intelligence? \n\nI envy your youthful optimism.
So many downvotes, have an upvote. The idea of reducing some tedious regulation is good if done correctly. The 2 for 1 order is great marketing but bad in reality. I wish they would actually go through and reduce regulations smartly or at least make an effort to make it easier to understand. It huts small businesses who may try to enter a space, where the big guys can throw pennies (for them, probably 500k in law fees) at compliance with the law but the little guy is unable to because those costs are huge for them.
Even the 2-for-1 is a gift to the plutocrats.
If you can't find 2 useless regulations to get rid then you aren't looking hard enough. Easy. This is the USA Government buddy.
[Yup.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
He implied no such thing.
Um, pick any 2 of the 1 million in the books :) Hell, just throw darts at the 10 inch thick document.
> I wish they would actually go through and reduce regulations smartly or at least make an effort to make it easier to understand.\n\nAgencies are already doing this, all the time. We live in a complicated time and a complex society that is full of bad actors who are actively trying to undermine the system for their own gain. Simple rules don't always work. \n\nSource: I read the federal registers. 
Here's a question: why does the USPS need to make a profit? \n\nIs there a reason that providing high quality mail service to every residence in the country isn't worth 5 billion dollars? (Less than 1% of the budget) \n\nWhy do you think this is a result of regulations and not legislation as alleged by /u/breadstickninja ?  \n\nRegulations generally reduce operating costs of agencies at the inconvenience of private parties. This is why Republicans don't usually like them. Regulations are why the USPS won't mail alcohol for private parties. 
So which two food, drug, flight or transit safety regulations do you want to go when they add a new one?
In his first month as President, I've only seen ONE intelligent idea emerge: the 2 for 1 order, "requires agencies to revoke two regulations for every new rule they want to issue."\n\n\nThe rest has been nothing but madness and re-treads of old failed policies: renew the drug war, remove financial regulations, revert to Biblical family planning, villainize the press, giant leaps backwards for equal rights for women and minorities, Sharia law in the USA with a Christian veil ....\n\nWe are making one Hell of a bed to sleep in.
"I assume it's true because it feels like it should be; therefore, it is true."
Who gives a shit about small business, though?\n\nSeriously, small business owners are some of the most entitled fucks around.  They have no regard for workplace safety, wage and hour, or anti-discrimination protections.  "I'm a job creator so I can do whatever the fuck I want, no matter who gets hurt" seems to be the attitude of most of them.\n\nAt least large companies have professional HR departments.  HR exists to protect the company, yes, but part of protecting the company is making sure they're not exposed to lawsuits they're sure to lose.  HR professionals know that the Wage and Hour Division does not fuck around, and so if some middle manager somewhere is doing just whatever the fuck he feels like, HR will tell him to cut that shit out and shape the fuck up in an instant.
> In his first month as President, I've only seen ONE intelligent idea emerge: the 2 for 1 order, "requires agencies to revoke two regulations for every new rule they want to issue."\n\nThat's actually an incredibly stupid, childish, and poorly-thought-out idea.
You keep making claims about "bazillions" of regulations, or saying that we should just throw darts and eliminate whichever regulations they hit. That type of lack of specificity is characteristic of people who have no real command of a subject. You still have specified NO regulations that you assert are responsible for the operating losses of the USPS and you have provided NO evidence that regulations, rather than the requirement to pay retirement benefits decades before they are due, are responsible.\n\nYour argument about junk mail, it turns out, is also a load of made-up bullshit. "Junk mail" is not delivered for free. In fact, it provides a high-volume, consistent and guaranteed source of income for the Postal Service, and in fact, USPS officials cite it as [an important source of revenue](https://stateimpact.npr.org/new-hampshire/2011/09/27/how-junk-mail-is-helping-to-prop-up-the-postal-service/) without which they would be in worse financial shape. As usual, you're completely full of shit.
Postal Service Net Income/Loss By Year\n2015 - $5.1 billion loss.\n2014 - $5.5 billion loss.\n2013 - $5 billion loss.\n2012 - $15.9 billion loss.\n\nFedEx and UPS somehow manage to make money. Sure, they don't have to deliver junkmail to every trailer in Kansas, but then change the damned rules.\n\nYour turn.
How is that an intelligent order?  It's a one-size fits-all approach to one of the world's largest and most complex organizations... it sounds remarkably naive to me. 
Did you realise you posted this as a top comment?
I'm not going to keep writing well-sourced arguments for a lazy and uninformed antagonist who just keeps parroting the same unsubstantiated claims with no evidence whatsoever. All you've really said so far is that it *feels* to you like the USPS must be losing money because of regulations. You don't know. But your *emotions* make you feel like it must be true.\n\nI'm arguing logic and evidence, and you just want to talk about your feelings. That puts us at an impasse. I have no further time nor patience for your nonsense. Have fun with your feelings.
You sir are an idiot.  \n\nCan I interest you today in making a donation for Trump 2020?  You are a perfect donor.
Source, please.
"I assume it's false because it feels like it should be; therefore, it is false"\n\nI think I'm in a parallel Universe here. I'm responding to real live people who believe the USA Government is a model of efficiency. I think I need a drink.
I bet you thought Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan was just minunderstood economic brilliance, right?
You want to put some metrics on that line? \n\nMedicare has a 3% overhead. The average private insurer has about 20% overhead. \n\nYour turn. 
I saw it coming, yes "but".\n\n\nThey lose money because they are run about as efficiently as your local Motor Vehicle Department. The USPS has a bazillion regulations they must abide by, do you seriously not understand that? Yes, I'm aware of their retirement mess.\n\n\nDo you really think a government entity who is losing billions per year should be delivering JUNK mail to my doorstep on Saturday?\n\n\nI'd say it's you who are completely clueless.
It's a naive, misguided approach. \n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/upshot/why-trumps-2-for-1-rule-on-regulations-is-no-quick-fix.html
Says the guy who I am sure has zero work experience in the federal government. 
If there are so many, it shouldn't be hard for you to name two specific ones, right?
and another "yes but". You & I both know I"m not going to pull out a copy of their regulations, c'mon.\n\nThis whole discussion has been enlightening for me. Apparently I'm not as "progressive" minded as I thought I was.\n\nPut me in charge of USPS and I've them breaking even in 1 year. Even if it meant once weekly mail delivery, unless there's a regulation that would prevent me from implementing that.\n\nIf they are losing $5 bil per year then their "high volume" source of income apparently isn't charging enough, right?
/u/DarkGamer is correct.  I did not imply that the government is a model of efficiency.  However, there are two points that are important to consider in that regard:\n\n1.  [Government can be efficient](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2011/09/20/medicare-is-more-efficient-than-private-insurance/).  Its a common trope to suggest that government is inefficient to undermine the argument for its valuable contributions to society.  It is simply untrue.  Government has inefficiencies, but so does the private sector.\n\n2.  In some cases, government *shouldn't* be efficient.  For example, if you are processing a claim for disability benefits in the private sector, it is in the company's best interest to do as little as possible to assist a claimant with completing the paperwork properly and getting approved.  In government, it is in society's best interest to help that disabled person get assistance.  Therefore, even if it is inefficient, it makes sense for case workers to help claimants get their claims submitted completely with the most evidence possible.
The Postal Service loses money because it is required to pre-fund future retirement benefits in a way that no other company or organization is subject to and is required to do so because of a Republican-backed law called the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that was passed in 2006. You should know this. It's been in the news for years.\n\nAlso, the Postal Service isn't a regulation. And in addition to apparently having no idea about the biggest financial policy impacting the Postal Service for the past decade, you didn't even attempt to connect its financial health to regulations at all. You didn't even make an argument and you don't seem to have any idea at all what you're talking about.
Yeah, I agree. It seems like one of those things that sounds great, but I see two (totally uneducated) issues going forward: \n\neither A) the regulations become more complex, with more hidden legalese that while the actual number of regulations are less, they end up regulating more fiercely. Possibly too fiercely when you realize that your ability to create new regulations grows smaller and smaller each time. \n\nOr B) eventually as time goes by and the world changes, you'll find that important new and necessary regulations aren't made because agencies need to pick and choose what is most important. Then you have a government that can't adapt and evolve because it's stuck playing a game of solomon's wisdom. It basically serves to tie the hands of the future. \n\nIt's a great sound byte and seems smart when you hear about it on the news and think about it for a minute before getting back to your day (I thought it was one good idea out of a thousand when I just heard it), but when you let it rattle around, it really seems more like a time bomb waiting to implode. 
all sizes of companies can sometimes be money grubbing scum.  doesn't mean they always are.  generalizing can be harmful.
Eh, whatever. Sometimes happens when I'm on mobile. It's not like that guy was worth talking to anyway.

Cuba has cheap labor and nice places to visit.  Increased competition for vacation locations would be better for all American tourists.  Same thing goes for rum, sugar, and other Caribbean goods though.
I have a decent sized yard and I live in Minneapolis.  I think that people who aren't familiar with the Twin Cities probably picture Minneapolis as downtown instead of picturing the neighborhoods near Minnehaha.
No.  Its obviously the East Lake Denny's.  It's gonna go down in the alley behind the abandoned Rainbow.
I wasn't to downvote to make this news go away. I'm sad that it wouldn't matter. 
Yeah... This ban has been in place for years.  I was there in 2013 working in a non-military position.  Going to the bars around the bases were like ghost-towns.  It was completely absurd.  The military's whole response to the sexual assault problems on Okinawa are dangerously ignorant.  I remember them censoring the music on the radio to not play "Blurred Lines" or how they would cut out photos of anyone shirtless in magazines (scuba magazines, bikini models, etc).  These ham-fisted solutions were absurd because they didn't actually address the underlying culture.
Hey there Twin Cities!
Didn't Muammar Gaddafi try this like 30 years ago?
Its because they added so many more spawns.  You don't need to walk around looking anymore.
She still didn't have access to the same information as the DA, therefore she shouldn't be saying what the DA should or shouldn't be doing.
That was completely my point.  I don't think you can be "close to the action" as OP said without being in one of the sprawling burbs unless you are actually in the city.  And most people who aren't familiar with the cities probably don't know how accessible the state, national, and local parks are or how much space you can still get while in the city proper.  Maybe not exactly what OP was looking for, but it would be worth looking at.
The emails specifically stated that there would be showers and western toilets.  The emails also detailed a course that we didn't end up running on.  
Yeah... if you look at the site though, it is a marathon organized entirely by Americans and was 90% Westerners.  \n\nIt was seriously dangerous.  Not the fun kind of "I'm going to Tijuana" fun.. the "my tibia my explode out of my shins" dangerous.
4 year olds with irresponsible parents aren't endangered.
Haha where in the Southern Hemisphere was there a foot of snow, 30mph winds, and -15 weather?
Yeah.... I completely get that.  My point is that anyone with $250,000 in assets (unless they are obscenely rich) would be quite stupid to leave it in cash.
What is the coldest you have ever been?  
As someone who has been to Okinawa on military orders for several months, this is absolutely untrue. 
Yeah, I mean I've lived in Asia for a few years as well.  That being said, this race was organized by Americans....
"anything outside of New York and Jersey."\n\nPretentious much? Also, what about Italy... you know... the home of pizza?
As someone who works for VA, it's appalling to see him looking to privatize and ditch Sec. McDonald. 
30 year at 3.00% on $65,000.  House was super cheap as a foreclosure.  TBH, I had to put a bit into it, so if I had a loan on the total cost of the home, it would be closer to $500.
Jesus.  That's a shit ton of money.  My mortgage for my house two blocks from the blue line is $274.
How is it dumb?  The cost of car ownership alone nearly outweighs any savings you'd get out of living in the burbs.
Looks like he caught a lift.
I don't think that is really a fair comparison... Bill Gates and his stock are very different than a few shares of a mutual fund.
Just live in Minneapolis. It's not that much more expensive than the burbs and its really nice not needing to deal with the sprawl. 
Saudi Arabia has Wahhabi Islam as the state religion (the same form of Sunni Islam as Al Qaeda and ISIS) and China was the primary belligerent in the Korean War.  China is an ally to North Korea and has been since before the Korean War.  In fact, with China the US had a similar policy towards the Communist government from 1949 until 1972 (recognizing Taiwan instead of Beijing).
To be clear, it starts Sunday. It hasn't started yet.

As both a landlord and someone who smokes 4-5 times a week indoors, I can guarantee that what you're saying is inaccurate.  \n\n>Burning anything in a house will leave a residue.\n\nIf this is true, then why doesn't my house reek of burnt natural gas from my furnace, dryer, and stove?  What about cooking basically anything indoors?  Sure there is going to be a very temporary smell, but it doesn't leave a residue on the walls in the way that nicotine does.\n\nI had a renter I inherited on my first property who smoked cigs like a chimney indoors.  It took me a week to get the smell out.  I then lived in that unit for over a year, smoking weed 3-5 times a week indoors (plus whatever my roommate did).  When I showed it to prospective renters, nobody mentioned it and I had a lease signed the first day of showings.\n\nCigarettes and tobacco are an entirely different animal than nearly anything else.
when will this be available?
Cuba never got the missiles.  They never arrived or were installed in Cuba.\n\nAlso, we do not have a complete embargo against any other country like we do against Cuba.  Americans cannot even travel to Cuba, but they are free to do so with any other country.  \n\nMy point isn't that it is a fairness issue, its that I don't understand why we will allow *some* trade with every other country, but not Cuba.  Americans would benefit from the open market.
As a landlord, people who are financially secure and have owned a home in the past.  They understand the cost of having a home and don't take it for granted that everything works.  I've had renters before (that I inherited from a previous owner) who trashed the place and cost me $3,000 in clean up costs.  Surprise, surprise... 500 credit score with a bankruptcy in the past 4 years.  Bankruptcy doesn't equal smoking indoors and keeping illegal pets, but for some reason there's a correlation...
This isn't necessarily true. My dad has Duane's syndrome and it never corrected 
They used the space for dual speakers and added battery life. The headphone jack was going to go away eventually. It's kind of weird how people are calling it dumb or shortsighted when I doubt very many people would doubt that in 5 years it would be gone. Obviously we can argue about whether or not now is the right time, but that doesn't seem to be the discussion. 
I meant that the missiles were never installed and pointed at the US in the same way that you alluded to (like how the American missiles in Turkey were completely armed and ready).  And arguing over the semantics of something that happened 55 years ago doesn't undermine any of my original argument.  We have diplomatic relations with Russia and Americans can freely travel and spend in Russia, yet they clearly were far more menacing than Cuba was.  Your example of the Cuban Missile Crisis would have been a perfectly good reason for the embargo 50 years ago, but at this point it is an anecdotal piece of history that pales in comparison to countless other international crisis.\n\nNorth Korea actually has nuclear weapons and is fairly close to putting them onto an ICBM, yet Americans aren't barred from going to Pyong Yang for a vacation.  Why is Cuba so special?
Right, but that isn't what was advertised.  We thought we were going to a marathon, not hiking without any medical personnel.
Minnesota represent!
Grapeshot is an OP version of cherry bomb.
Tell that to Sumner Redstone...
Why do you say that? I can sell everything in my brokerage account today for cash. 
OK... Cuba never had missiles aimed at us.\n\nThat being said, there is a huge difference between sanctions and an embargo.  Americans can still travel to Syria, Iran, and North Korea without being prosecuted for spending money there.  The US policy towards Cuba is objectively harsher than the U.S. policy towards any other country.  My point is that there is a huge distinction between an embargo and economic sanctions.  You may be right that the base is currently voting against our current trade policy with China, but nobody is advocating cutting off all trade and diplomatic relations with them.
Maybe you should go back to your home on whore island!\n
Where?
Yeah, I mean I'm spending another 11 days here, so it wasn't just the race.  That being said, if it wasn't for the race, I would have gone somewhere else.  The registration was $250 and it required us to stay in a specific hotel that was far more expensive than where we would have otherwise stayed.
I get that.  I'm saying that if you aren't familiar with the Twin Cities or Minneapolis, you might not get how residential and "non-city" it feels in some areas.  Comparing S. Minneapolis to basically anywhere in the Bay Area or Manhattan would be crazy.  Its not highly urbanized, there is a very large amount of space, lawns, yards, and plenty of low-density residential space.

Shoes matter 100%.  Think about how you run barefoot vs. how you run with shoes.  It is going to be inevitably different in some way.  That means that the shoes are affecting the way you impact with the ground.  Translate that to your weight and think about what that could mean.  Let's look at me for example:\n\n- 200lbs guy\n- 30" stride.\n- 6 mile average run\n\nSo on an average run, I am subjecting each of my joints to 528 separate jolts of 200lbs of weight.  If my shoe isn't helping me balance that weight, I'm fucked.  Putting it in worse terms, my shoe could actually be doing more harm than good.\n\nPersonally, I used to run with (b)asics.  Not a bad shoe at all, but the simply didn't fit me at all.  I have weirdly wide feet (I'm talking frog level 2E size).  I also have a slight angle with my impact.  I could barely make it 3 miles before the shin splints and joint pain would kill me.  I got a proper gait analysis and swapped up to Mizuno Wave Inspires (initially the 9s, then 11s, now 13s).  Couldn't be happier.  They help correct my weird duck-footed stride and are comfortable as fuck.  I keep the old pairs for vacation shoes when I know I'm going to be walking for hours on cobble-stone.\n\nMoral of the story:  Invest in the things between you and the ground.  The world is a hard place.  If you don't want want cheap mattresses, pillows, tires, why would you want cheap shoes?\n
Not really. Republicans still won 1.5 million more votes for the House in 2016.  I agree that the electoral college is unfair and so is gerrymandering. But this notion that the system is completely rigged against progressives is not true. Progressives need to get off their grandstands and actually articulate how their policies will help rural and suburban communities. If we keep only winning the cities, we will remain in the minority. 
FREAK DAT BITCH OUT TONE!!! 
Incorrect.  Two different levels.
Actually most people didn't vote. 
How would trading with Cuba make it legal for Cubans to move to the US?
1.  The course organizers told us the change was due to the visas of the many US military runners.  Heard it from the horse's mouth.\n2. No EMTs were on site.  I asked the lead organizer the next morning.\n3.  I must have missed the second set of toilets.  That being said, the organizers did advertise that there would be showers.  There was no toilet paper when I used the toilets.\n4.  I see your point with the gels, but other food items that aren't filled with mayo is kind of a necessity for an event like this.\n5. This was not to be expected.  The photos I put into the album are directly from the website where we registered.  I've been on the wall multiple times.  This wasn't my first trip to China or my first experience in dealing with the random weird shit that happens here.  It was very poor organization and was terribly misleading.\n6.  See 5.\n\n
Call your bank and ask for a temporary increased limit. I do that all the time. 
The missiles were never deployed.  And if that is the reason, why do we trade with Russia?
To clarify the title of this post, the event hasn't begun.  It begins in two days.

Oh, so just to be clear /u/spartan2600 has a better understanding of the nuance and evidence of this case than the professionals who are trained and paid to understand the law and had actual access to the evidence?  Just because someone died doesn't automatically mean they need to be charged.  I completely agree that there is pervasive racial bias in the police.  They probably could have deescalated the situation better than they did.  All of that doesn't mean that they were wrong to use deadly force in the moment.  And even if they were wrong to use it, you wouldn't know because you aren't privy to the actual evidence and circumstances of the case.
to be fair, the commission ultimately comes out of the transaction.  It doesn't matter who pays it.  In the end, a commission creates the same result: the buyer ends up paying more than the seller would have accepted.
I think you have a lot of obvious options and I'm not going to waste precious calories explaining them all to you. My only piece of advice is to do it in a way that preserves their meat. 
It has to be fake.  I have a torch like that and its shit for snow removal.
That's what I thought until I had the following happen in the span of three months last year:\n\n-crack in foundation needed full excavation and $8400 repair\n\n-stove completely broke\n\n-microwave started giving off smoke and sparks and needed replacement\n\n-tenant's friend attempted to set house on fire\n\n-boiler regulator failed (MN winter)\n\n-garage door opener motor broke\n\n-mouse infestation\n\n-busted pipe leaked through ceiling \n\nThese were all in a duplex that had been perfect up until those three months and has been perfect since. Passive income is only passive when it's not active. It sounds dumb to put it that way, but there is a reason it is considered earned income by the IRS and not interest or capital gains. 
you could have just.... you know.  not updated.
Happy to trade you my best Mr. Mime!
First, having the missiles on the island and having them installed and deployed are two very different things.  All Cuba did was arrange their defensive anti-aircraft missiles around the future deployment sites of the ICBMs.  The ICBMs were never deployed or operational (unlike the American missiles in Turkey).\n\nAlso, wait... So your'e saying that Russia does not have [ICBMs capable of hitting the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICBMs#Soviet_Union_.2F_Russia)?  And your'e also saying that North Korea's active march towards being able to launch a nuclear weapon at the US is worse than a transgression from 55 years ago?  I just don't get it.  \n
I think you mean farthest. Further expresses degree, farther expresses distance.

As a landlord with a lot of references for Section 8 and similar programs, I agree that there are a lot of people on Section 8 who are polite and clean.  That being said, its much more likely for people on Section 8 to never have owned a home or understand what kind of costs maintenance really add up to.  They simply have less resources and are in a much higher risk-group.  And considering the extra hoops you have to go through to have your property approved for Section 8, its pretty bullshit to expect people to be completely OK with renting their hard-earned property to people who don't appreciate how much work and effort goes into running a rental property.

If I were in your shoes, I would live in Longfellow off of the Blue Line.  I own two properties right off of the blue line.  The rent in this area is much better than the areas you are suggesting and you're still only 15 minutes to downtown on the train.  Also, the parks and trails are way better.

I disliked the manner in which Clinton positioned herself as the Democratic nominee, but I'm glad that she's not retreating into the shadows with her tail between her legs after a historically embarrassing political loss.  I still support her as a public figure.  Now that there aren't any elections to be won, I'd like to see her bear her teeth a little and maybe win back some on the left who despise her and those in the middle who saw her as milquetoast.
This is a job for dribbble!
It's beyond me why a president would stoke fires of conflict between himself and the press.  Even if a president were of impeccable character and polite demeanor, there would still be a great deal of scrutiny focused in his direction.  Antagonizing the press will merely embolden them to undermine you or simply make you look like a fool.  Throw in the fact that he spit in the face of the intelligence community *while they were investigating his inner circle* and you have a recipe for destruction. 
Fair points, but if she's no longer behold to donors then she can say whatever she likes, however she likes.  Whether she does so is another ball game.\n\nThe DNC poisoned itself, they're still in denial over why Clinton lost.  They blame the voters and not the smoothed out, saltine candidate who pushed for universal health care over two decades ago as First Lady but didn't have a single energizing quality this time around.  They thought playing it safe would win, and you can't put that all on Clinton or even the DNC, because just about everyone thought the election was over after the conventions.\n\nAt this moment, Democrats are in no position to exile potential allies.  If she can use her platform, which is arguably still a great asset just due to the vast audience it can reach, to make our opponents look like the fools they are, I'm all for it.

Just because you've got 300 shameless lap dogs in the Legislature doesn't afford you the same luxury in the judiciary.  Most judges, regardless of their political affiliations and views, truly are the "smartest person in the room" in pretty much any room they walk.  There's a certain hubris when you rise to that sort of position, that absolutely no one is going to tell you how to think or rule.\n\nHaving said that, if the executive starts outright ignoring the judiciary then we face an existential constitutional crisis that will tear the seams of the federal government apart.

I look back fondly on our team's successes over the last 20 years.  Particularly, the Supporter's Shield and MLS Cup of 2008.  In 2007 I had moved into my first college house and we became die hard supporters.  Watched every game and traveled from Bowling Green to Columbus to watch roughly ten more in '07 and '08.  To see that culminate in a domestic double was thrilling.  \n\nI even look fondly on our 2015 run, even though the wheels fell off in spectacular fashion and so many key pieces are already gone.

That's not even close to the point I was trying to make.  A commenter made an inflammatory comment saying that the GOP = Christian ISIS.  The next commenter made an equally inflammatory comment that the GOP aren't executing prisoners in a brutal fashion. \n\nThere are a lot of folks in the US who are concerned with the march of legislation that prioritizes the Christian religion as the religion that's supported by the state.  We've seen Christian extremists execute terror attacks just as often as we've seen Islamic terror attacks.  The KKK is an organization whose roots are protestant Christian in nature, the Olympic Park bomber is considered to be a Christian terrorist, and Robert Deal is another recent example of Christian terrorism.\n\nDo members of the GOP outwardly support these attacks? Of course not.  However, they're creating an environment that's relentlessly hostile toward the *other*.  Mexican immigrants, Islam, blacks, gays, et al.  Trump has said that we should kill the families of Islamic terrorists.  The comparison of the GOP and ISIS is extreme and not accurate, but we're only a couple steps away from becoming fascism embodied.  Pointing the finger at the other, who's doing terrible things, doesn't absolve the evils being committed by those in power in our own backyard.

Agreed.  I don't look into US political news to see what sort of crazy that "45" teed up 8 hours ago.  I look into it because it seems like the shoe could drop at any time regarding this Russia scandal.  Don't get me wrong, I still read the crazy shit about his spats with journalists and each one fades after a few days, but anyone who thinks the Trump presidency ends after a full term in office doesn't see the writing on the wall.  Flynn was the first domino to fall and Priebus could very well be next.\n\nBehaving like a wounded animal when he speaks with an adversarial media is not *normal* for a president who is mere weeks into his term.
Most people with a solid grasp on reality and awareness of current events have been saying this for years.
There was an Oxford study from two or three years ago that estimated that 47% of common work positions could be totally automated in 20 years time, and estimated the likelihood of a particular job being automated in that time frame.  High skill positions (doctors, lawyers, judges) as well as creative positions (artists, musicians, writers) were considered no risk or low risk for automation (Some positions were given a value of 0 which indicated that regardless of how they scored based on the model, that they could not be automated).  However, nearly all other jobs were considered to be at risk for automation.  Mechanic, UPS driver, Paralegal, Pharmacist (though, somewhat ironically, Pharm *techs* are considered to be irreplaceable), McDonald's line cook, firefighter...you name it, there's a decent chance, according to their model, that the job could be automated.\n\nhttp://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/new-study-shows-nearly-half-of-us-jobs-at-risk-of-computerisation\n\nI think there's a link to the full study in that article. If not, it's easily found on Google.

As a liberal, living in a liberal college town district nestled in a red state, I know that I won't skip another election no matter how much it might appear that my vote will be inconsequential. 
No kidding.  I live in southern Arizona and many of my buddies have roots in Mexico.  A couple of them have said that older white folks have come up to them at the bar and said things to the effect of "your time in this country is coming to an end."  One of my friends is Mexican but looks just about as white as any other white bread dude and works as a bartender at the bar.  He was serving a couple of guys in their 50s or 60s during happy hour and they started spewing vile shit about Mexicans.  He sort of shrugged it off for a moment, but came back with their bill, told them to settle up and get the fuck out.\n\nThese people have always felt this way but are now feeling validated by people at the height of power in this country.  As dangerous as Trump and his white nationalist posse can be, it doesn't hold a candle to the silent threat of off kilter wackadoos that we might run into every day.  Radical Christian terrorism is a sad reality in 21st century America.

I contend that if he were really worth his supposed market value, then he wouldn't being going anywhere even if you got a 1st round offer.

That sort of explains how lost hikers are sometimes found close to their intended path and mere miles from civilization (roads, towns, etc).  I always wondered how hikers in relatively hospitable wilderness, like along the Appalachian trail, could become totally lost and wouldn't find their way back to civilization.  I know that exhaustion, exposure and hunger/thirst could keep a hiker stranded, but if you find yourself in a situation where you realize you're lost, I'd think there would be an immediate urgency to find help.  That gives you a day or two to move toward civilization.  If the brain is inherently "working against you," then I feel even worse for lost and inexperienced hikers.
Lol. Wut?

However, just looking at his stats, there's something there to be a nice bench player.\n\nI'd love to have him for the stretch run, given that there were a lot of fans who wanted to draft him in 2011 (myself *not* included) who could jokingly justify their opinion if the Cavs were fortunate enough to win a second straight title.
Mandate or not, they have near-complete control of the legislature.  The only thing that would cause them to consider pumping the brakes on their agenda would be fear of losing reelection. \n\nPence/Ryan is far from an ideal scenario, but I'd take 8 years of their shit to spare ourselves from another 12 months of Trump.
Deron looks like he'll fit in nicely.  He's obviously not the same player he was five years ago, but he's made a few nice passes already and he's definitely capable of taking control of the floor.  What a pickup.
Griff is *earning* his paycheck this week. I'd like to see a PG, but I don't know what the market will bear.\n\nLarry Sanders, anyone?
Sunday Times is OP.
The #neverhillary crowd is far more complicit than the #nevertrump crowd.  Trump was the most charismatic candidate the right had seen since Reagan and in response the left decided to grow a spine when their savior had been spurned.
While I agree that his words and actions through the years have had a hand in creating this disaster, I have to give him a little bit of credit for not being a complete partisan hack.  His views on anything and everything range from wackadoo to downright dangerous, but at least he follows his conscience, as misguided as it may be, and not the "R" next to a candidate's name.  It's more credit than we can seemingly give to those at the levers of power.
Folks like that like to throw out false equivalency arguments so that they can feel superior without having a basic understanding of the matter at hand.
If this shakes out in a way where Pence goes down too, I don't know how anything in the same orbit as the president gets out cleanly.  House and Senate leadership, cabinet appointees, et al could be affected.
I'm glad I've kept all of those high tier roll sidearms over the last year or so.\n\nIs the raid sidearm any good for pvp?
8 years turns into 2 or 3 pretty quick if you play your cards right.
What exactly constitutes "basic care?"  Yearly physical, prescription medications and protection from life changing illness and injury? 
I bet they're keeping the filibuster in the holster until a more impactful appointment comes up.  SCOTUS immediately comes to mind. 
It rarely gets coverage because, at this point, people who are interested are  more or less, aware of what's happening.\n\nRussia invaded and annexed Crimea and seem intent on annexing more lands under Ukrainian sovereignty.  It's a highly volatile situation, but if there's no news but "Russia and Ukraine are still fighting," then there's little incentive to report aside from the occasional mention of the conflict.
Is he going somewhere?
> but it's just plain hypocritical to say it's only (or even mainly) on one side of the fence.\n\nI'm so tired of this false equivalence.  Republican legislators have found every little legal advantage they can give themselves in order to win seats.  Voter suppression in all of it's forms (Voter ID, eliminating or limiting early voting and mail in ballots),  taking gerrymandering to it's current extreme, conservative "pundits" who spew lies and vitriol when the seas are calm but when they say something repugnant and stupid they're *just entertainers.*  Every evil thing you've ever heard a conservative accuse a liberal of committing, you can bet they're guilty of five times over.\n\nIn the last two presidential election years, Democratic candidates have received more than 50% of the total vote, yet they came away with far less than half of the seats.  In the single branch of federal government that's supposed to be the *most* democratic, Republicans have managed to carve out safe seats that insulate them only from centrist/liberal competition.\n\nThere's certainly a time for reasonable discussion, and we'll revisit that when there's not a demagogue in the Oval Office with a rag tag group of white nationalists, kleptocrats and Russian sympathizers in tow.  Now is the time for relentless opposition, because if Republicans haven't been punished for exploiting the most cynical aspects of politics, then they can expect a big dose of their own medicine.  Give it ten years and I'll reconsider taking the high road, again, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
You're aware that union jobs are typically paid more than similar jobs that are non union, yes?  You're also familiar with the concept that a unified labor force across many disciplines results in a fairer capital/labor relationship?  Finally, we're you aware that arguably the greatest period of prosperity, perhaps in human history relative to national and global standards, occurred in the US during its peak of union membership?\n\nGo ahead and take the bait that your wages are being stolen, just like your taxes are stolen wages.  That's what the folks who pay you want you to believe. 
OG Destiny players will recall the hardships of being "forever __" when trying to collect the complete set of raid armor from the Vault of Glass.   
I'm surprised that Alex Smith has even *one* pick six considering he'll pass up an open receiver for a two yard, out of bounds scramble any day of the week.
Reporters are more than entitled to express their opinions.  Even if it means calling our dear leader a whining, little baby-back bitch.
Never mind the near constant barrage from the right likening the Obama's to monkeys and apes.  It speaks to the class and restraint of President Obama to refrain from responding to these shameful and inflammatory attacks publicly.  Lord knows I can't promise that I'd have reacted in the same way.
I want nothing to do with Garoppolo if it's going to cost a first.  The he has a sample size of two starts and ended up hurt in the second one.  His numbers are efficient but, again, the sample size is small.\n\nNew England either has to move him or let him walk after next year.  They need to *sell* him to Cleveland, not wait for Cleveland to buy.  They aren't in a position to make large demands just because they've been savvy over the last 20 years.\n\nI don't like any QB in this draft that might go in the first.  I'd rather go after Tyrod Taylor than Garoppolo.
I never said I supported his politics.  I merely stated a fact that he didn't vote for DeVos.  You're the one hung up on Cory Booker for whatever reason.
As soon as they push through all their unpopular legislation, surely.
You must have the historical perspective of a goldfish, because *some* white Christians have indiscriminately killed blacks, browns, natives, gays and basically anyone else who doesn't tick the boxes of a "good and genuine American" since before the country's founding.     
SCROTUS? I like it.
Papi, Dan has told the story of you working for a company as an engineer, commuting to Chicago from Miami for years, then having been unceremoniously let go from the company.\n\nDo you begrudge the company for their treatment of you, or do you consider it a "blessing" of sorts, given that you get to work closely with one of your highly accomplished sons and the fact that you've become a beloved sports personality?\n\nIt's truly a joy to watch you on Highly Questionable and hearing you on the Dan Le Batard Show.  You never fail to make me smile and your story, as I've heard and understand it, is uplifting. 
RJ going hard with the teabag.
Your false equivalence is showing.  How embarrassing! 
My buddies call most of the roaming supers by their defining quality and add "boy" to the end.\n\n"Golden boy"\n\n"Blade boy"\n\n"Hammer boy"\n\n"Storm boy"\n\nWe don't bother to call out Radiance supers in 6v6 because I don't think anyone is alarmed when they see one.
*The lady doth protest too much, methinks.* 
Boy, I'd like to see your secret diary from 2012.  I'd bet it predicts the *exact moment* Putin releases the pee-pee tapes once his useful idiot becomes a liability.  After all, you're *so smart*!  Much smarter than OBUMMER.
You're a fucking idiot.
I think a vast majority of Muslims would also like to be afforded the luxury of not having their entire religion and prophet linked with violent extremism.\n\nIt's time to call a spade a spade.  The Olympic Park bomber, Dylann Roof and Robert Dear were all Christian extremists.  "Domestic terrorist" or "mass shooter" isn't descriptive enough to bring to light the root of the problem: pockets of white, Christian society are be radicalized and are encouraged to carry out violent acts because they feel they've lost control of  *their* country.  It's not their country.  \n\nI'm sorry that sharing the religion of violent extremism bothers or offends you, but a couple of weeks ago we had hundreds of decent folks with visas and/or refugee status denied legal entry because we have an Islamophobe at the levers of power.  At this moment, people need to know that terrorism isn't synonymous with *only* radical Islam. 
Even if it doesnt, the fact that seemingly every week the EPA, the CFPB or the FEC face action that could eliminate or de-tooth them is disturbing.
Agree with you on all counts but Tillerson.   He could very well go down if the shoe drops on these Russian corruption allegations.
Between the methamphetamine and the Pall Mall's, I'm surprised that *any* of them could afford a Netflix sub.
This is awesome.  My GF loves The Sims and I bought her the Pets/Seasons/Generations bundle along with the nightlife expansion for less than $20.\n\nI got her The Sims 3 for Wii as a shot in the dark stocking stuffer for Xmas.  It scratched the itch for her, but it's not even close to the same game as on PC.  She was saying last night how she wanted it on PC again and I told her next Steam sale I'd get it for her.  I come home today and it's on sale!
Remember when Crimea was annexed by the Russians in 2014?  Remember when the Syrian conflict became a proxy war between the US and Russia?  Remember when Russia interfered in the electoral processes of Western democracies?
MLS clubs are a business.  "Handshake deals" have burned folks on the management side as well as the player side in professional sports for ages.  Carlos Boozer famously had a handshake agreement with Gordon Gund and signed with the Utah Jazz not long after.\n\nI like Steve Clark and I'll never forget the run we had with him and Kei Kamara, among others, in becoming MLS Cup runners up.  Having said that, I also liked William Hesmer and Andy Gruenebaum, yet we had no problem moving on from them.  \n\nSteve was hardly a transcendent goalkeeping talent.  In fact, I'd argue he put Crew SC out of the MLS Cup game before it even started.  That blunder falls on him and him alone.  Handshake agreement be damned, why retain a goalkeeper who commits such a bone headed move when comparable talent is available.\n\nThere are plenty of MLS level talent goalkeepers out there.  Whether Crew SC wants them or they want to be on Crew SC is another story, but given the outcome of the MLS cup and the outcome of the 2016 season, I prefer to move on.

He's heard the radio edit, as I have.\n\nhaha, you aren't in IT are you? It's simple, same way routers and tvs and gaming systems have the controls. All the music services already label songs as "mature", you only need 1 simple check to prevent that same song from playing over the device.
I simply walked over to the echo and said alexa stop. Told him let's find the radio version of this song on youtube, and that was that.\n\nShould I have let the mothafucka's and nigga's play to completion?

Man up buddy. From the way she's behaving she's already controlling the situation.

Speaking of the Denver area and going back 20 years in time, it would be hit or miss if I had taken same strategy.\n\nI can think of many neighborhoods that at the time were labeled up and coming. About half of them up and came, the others did not :(\n\nI've noticed if there is a physical barrier to the bad and good neighborhoods (train tracks, bridge, river, highway) it's harder to up and come. If it's just a random line between neighborhoods then it's easier to make the transition.

Back in 2013 for the heart-breaking play-off loss to Ravens, I reached over to my cup holder to have a sip of beer and the top was frozen. I had to poke it with my finger to break the top layer of ice before taking a drink.\n\nI have not been to another single digit game since.
If you are comparing those 2 I'd focus on the cities instead. Dallas has lower cost of living, Denver has everything else.

I'm to blame for not designing parental controls into the Echo.

I had good results with Rebif for about 7 years, started taking it when first diagnosed and was having an intense flair up and was able to get it under control.  I could never shed the side effects and have switched to Tecfidera about a year ago, but my relapses have been quiet for a couple of years.
You may want to have a sleep study done.  I found out after years of struggling with acuity problems(I am an IT executive so that is a big problem), that when I changed medications and was able to sleep more fully that most of my mental deficiencies that I had attributed to MS were side effects of not getting quality sleep because of my Rebif.
End of April
Saw a guy standing outside watering a tree with a garden hose in what could only be characterized as monsoon type rain.
Had a grizzly stalk me while fishing on the Kenai and didn't know it until leaving and saw fresh tracks that had not been there on the way in.  Guy was only about 20 feet behind me.
It is possible to have a personal view, but remain unbiased professionally. 
It becomes less miraculous when you find out that they're just covering up the fact that they had lunch at a strip club. 
I was in rebif for seven years and was miserable the whole time with flu-like symptoms.  I switched to tecfidera three years ago and it changed my life.  No side effects at all and many things that I assumed were MS related (fatigue, brain fog) disappeared as well almost instantly.  I also started intermittent fasting about the same time so too many variables to control for but rebif was definitely the main culprit in my misery.  I always just manually injected with no problem. 
My son barely squeaked into a state college (probation for gpa inder 3.0 going into his freshman year) and now is a graduate fellow at Yale.  A lot can happen when you get to college and get the right motivation.
SCIENCE!!!!!
Tecfidera has assistance for paying for the drug.  I have a very high income so I didn't think there was any way I would get any assistance but they pick up the entire $150 co pay from my insurance.  
I feel like my MS has made coping with stress super easy, my body instantly lets me know when I am getting stressed and I have developed mechanisms to deal with it.  I work a super stressful job and everyone thinks that I am super calm and collected even in the most stressful situations.  What they don't know is that my MS lets me get ahead of it way before most people would have any clue that they were getting over stressed.
Thou Shalt Question Everything!
I moved to Pismo Beach CA (coastal San Luis Obispo community)last year and the weather is ideal year round.  High temps rarely below 55 or above 75 and lows almost never below 45.  No AC in most houses and great outdoor activities(hiking, biking, water sports), air quality and access to fresh produce.  I can exercise outside almost anytime with no discomfort or heat related issues.  \n\nHousing is expensive by anything but SF or LA standards but I was able to find a high paying position nearby and the quality of life was definitely worth the extra costs associated with living on the central coast.
Baby seal walks into a club...
I have been doing almost this exact diet for four years.  No exacerbations during the entire time. 
I have rrms as well switched from rebif to tecfidera 8 months ago and it has been a life changer.  My chronic fatigue is all but completely gone, cognitive and motor are the best they have been  in 10 years and I have no active lesions, so something like this would be a hard sell for me.\n 
Moved from Louisville, Ky to Pismo Beach, CA.  Best move ever.  Temps here are moderate(no ac needed) all year long and I can get outside to exercise every day without getting overheated.  Needless to say my symptoms have moderated greatly since the move.
I made the switch 9 months ago and it has been very positive.  I had pretty bad side effects from rebif, I have had absolutely none on tecfidera from day one.  There were a lot of things that I thought were MS related that seem to have been more of a result of rebif side effects.  I should be getting another MRI in May so I'll have better evidence of whether it is a effective as it seems to be.
Math.  If something exists, it exists because there is a probability that it will exist and if such probability exists then it is possible but not necessarily certain to exist.  God is ascribing certainty to a possibility.
Haven't seen Kansas yet.  Tripping to Colorado through Kansas is the worst.  They should just build a sky bridge from KC to Denver and turn the rest of that endless shit hole into a windmill farm.  Not even mentioning the f'ed up politics.
I was on Rebif .44mcg every other day, for 8 years.  I switched to Tecfidera last summer and would never go back.  I was getting the flu symptoms with almost every injection the whole time I was on it but I did not have many flare ups so I suffered through it.  I have had no new flare ups since I went on Tecfidera, no side effects at all and my energy if 100% better because I sleep through the night now for the first time in years.  Obviously everyone's personal chemistry and disease is different but I feel like I got my life back since switching.  Added bonus is that with the assistance program my co-pay for the Tecfidera is $0 and I make well into six figures.
CIO.  Started on help desk, trained myself, got multiple systems and network engineering  certs.  I am really good with people and business concepts as it turns out.  Went back to school got bs in business while working.  Multi 100k/year.  Took 7 years to go from help desk to director and have been managing IT now for 14 years at progressively higher levels.  It is stupidly stressful though.
I found most of the symptoms I thought were due to MS were due to rebif after I switched to tecfidera.  Rebif made me miserable.
The initial side effects are flu like symptoms which are supposed to abate after 90 days or so.  They never did for me.  Pretty strong fever, aches and chills that sometimes made it hard to function at all.  I tried using nsaids at various intervals before a shot, timing the shots at different times of day and various other permutations but in the end I just made sure I dosed with Ibuprofen 30 minutes before and took the shot before I went to bed so that I could sleep through the worst of it.  Of course this caused other problems because my sleep was crap and my level of fatigue went up as well which I did not even realize until I switched meds, I had always thought most of my fatigue is was MS related.  I stayed with it for so long because I wasn't having any real relapses to speak of and my scans were getting progressively cleaner every year to the point that I had no active lesions on my last scan.\nHope this helps.
Maybe not funny but definitely the wierdest.  \nWalked into Dallas Airport restroom late at night.  As I walk in I can hear the sound of water gushing onto the floor.  I turn the corner to where the urinals are and see a guy in a nice taylored business suite, with his legs set wide, his head tilted back, eyes closed and peeing into a urinal that is overflowing onto his legs and feet.  I froze for a moment and did a double check, the guy didn't seem to notice me.  I slowly turned around and walked back out.
On the other hand Click Hole (www.clickhole.com) is pretty damned funny just because it is so hard to distinguish the stuff that they put out from the real click bait.
Awwww, gotta love the New Albanian guys.  They should sell pizza left overs and table scraps from Rich-o's.
I am on tecfidera for 3 years.  Diagnosed 10 years ago was originally on rebif but it was worse than the Ms.

Best friend's sister was 25 I was 18.  We had been friends for a long time and it had developed into a flirty relationship throughout highschool.  We began driving up to visit her brother (my best friend) at his college and the relationship started to take a more serious tone.  Long story short, slept with her, married her and 24 years later couldn't be happier.  Best friend took it in stride because he saw it coming before either one of us did.
I moved to Pismo Beach CA and a friend immediately sent me Bugs Bunny videos.  Being from the midwest, it never dawned on me it was a real place growing up.
I was open about it originally but now that I am about to take a new job I made the decision to stay quiet about it.  I have never had any problems with it in my professional life I just don't think it is relevant for my employer to know any more than they need to know that I have nasal allergies.  There are too many misconceptions and an assumption of disability that I don't want to have to correct.\n 
Actually I prefer to read mu card number ans PIN out loud to during transactions to confirm accuracy.

I had my first symptoms at 16 but didn't get a diagnosis until I was in my late 30's. I always just always thought I was a bit of a hypochondriac with weird symptoms flaring up then going away over and over again.  \nAnyway I'm in my mid 40's, a successful executive and still nothing that I would call a serious disability.  Surround yourself with positive, supportive people.  My wife never even blinked when I was diagnosed and it inspired my daughter to become a neurologist.  How you frame the rest of your life and approach the set backs will make a huge difference in how the disease affects you long term.  Find the positives, take notice of the little victories and don't let the stress monster or negative people bring you down. Time and medical science (as well as everyone on this sub reddit) are on your side!
I would buy that theory.  I've always traced my initial symptoms of MS to when I was a teenager and had a very bad "mystery" virus that caused a high fever and made my entire body go numb randomly over a number of days.  After that I would get isolated numbness that my doctors always said was pinched nerves that never added up to MS until I was in my late 30's.
I switched from rebif to tecfidera last June and it has been a life changer for me, mainly due to bad side-effects to rebif which I was on for 8 years.  I have had no side effects at all on tecfidera and can now work out for prolonged periods of time without the fatigue or numbness that I've had since diagnosis.  I am also on Amantadine which seems to help with focus and fatigue.
I would say science for the lazy is closer to the mark.
Definitely an "oh shit!" moment.
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\nJames Joyce\n\n"A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh. Her thighs, fuller and soft-hued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down. Her slate-blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her bosom was as a bird's, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some dark-plumaged dove. But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face. \n\nShe was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. Long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. The first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither and thither; and a faint flame trembled on her cheek. \n\n—Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy. "\n\n
I had the same experience with the caveat that when I did get sick it was bad.  I asked my doc about it and she said that it was common with rebif and to make damned sure that I get a flu shot every year.
Trudeau for President 2020\nWhy the fuck not at this point?
I've had some luck with drinking tart cherry juice before bed.  Here's a URL to an article recently published.  \n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-tart-cherry-juice-increases-sleep-time-in-adults-with-insomnia-257037251.html\n\nI gave it a try for a few weeks and noticed a marked improvement in my ability to fall asleep and sleep through the night.  I stopped for two weeks and my bad sleep pattern re-emerged.  Whether or not it was placebo effect or not, I really don't care.
Hacking!!!!  Seriously wtf.
We need to define clear agreed upon lines with a committee made up of equal parts self-identifying north, central, and south jerseyans. In fact, I'm shocked it hasn't been done. 
Shhhh you're ruining it. 
Our news outlets have all been a little busy...
The hat! Oh my god, that hat! \n\nHe had to take off the hat in order to take his shirt off, then he put it back on? Amazing. 
He did. That was what was happening during the quickening (the lightning and screaming and whatnot). And the final prize was ultimate knowledge and mortality.\n\nAnd There was a cartoon at one point, not sure if it counts as anime or not.  It wasn't Connor or Duncan though, it was about Quentin. 
He's already immortal. At the beginning of Highlander two he's gotten all the smarts but he's super old. That is until some either time traveling or space traveling (unclear) other immortals show up and he's young(ish) again all of a sudden. Highlander 2 is generally disregarded as awful, but the canon is still intact, i believe. \n\nSo all the smarts flew into him and he finally gets to suffer and die. Which is what most immortal beings eventually want according to what books and movies have taught me.
It's proven!
Sort of an odd place to find religion, and that wasn't really what I meant by strip club lunch, I was thinking more that the strip club was a means to become sexually aroused, but where you're going with it is an equally, if not more interesting narrative. 
This is the basis for the term Fake News, which quickly changed definition to just badly written or biased journalism, when in reality, it was a VERY large concerted effort on Russia's part to destabilize, usually by creating stories that were ultra nationalist and pro-america, but helped deepen the divide we currently live in between the left and right. And it wasn't just targeted at us. \n\nSeriously, If you have the time, this investigative article about Russia's Troll Army is pretty amazing to read. If you don't have the time, make it. It's one to the most interesting articles I've read. \n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html\n\nStarts to make you wonder about the "alt-right's" online presence and how many of their outspoken, faceless voices are who they say they are and are from where they say they're from. (see note below)\n\nI had thought it was pretty crazy and dangerous that the Trump administration and others in the gov't were watering down the term for something that's been having devastating effects on our country, in order to use it to "erode trust" (get it?) in our media and polarize the people. Then it all started to make a lot more sense in my head when I considered all the rumors back during the election about the Trump teams ties to Russia.  This sort of almost confirms it for me. \n\nSo much of what we've seen in the last month is straight out of Putin's playbook, most notable being the creation of a government issue reality and claiming that the media is the opposition party. \n\nThen again, you'd think that there would be a better term than just Fake News, but I guess State Sponsored Trolling doesn't really have an air of urgency to it.\n\nEither way, today is going to be very very interesting. \n\nNOTE: \nI don't want this to come across as pointing fingers at the right. I'm a lefty, but i'm an American first. \n\nI used the alt-right community as an example because they have one of the loudest online voices, but it's not a one sided thing. \n\nThey're almost definitely playing us off one another. Both sides are receiving disinformation, both sides have digital agent provocateurs stirring things up online, so don't think that you're immune. and remember that when you start arguing left v right. Or more importantly, change your arguments into discussions.\n\nIf Russians are trying to divide us, Russians are our enemy. The dude that you're fighting with online about whether its a muslim ban or a travel ban, is an American. He's your brother. \n\nThe chick that's telling you why it's her body, her choice. She's your sister. Try to remember that. And if you agree. Spread that message. We just need to change the tone. We all want the same thing. \n\nDisagreeing is democracy and Compromise is the goddamned American Way. \n\n
The joke wasn't about my views, it was about the fact that his picks have been extreme. \n\nAnd sorry to trigger you, but fuck you with your bullshit attitude.
Who are you talking about?
You'd consider that central? I always thought it was split by the old area codes. 201 north jersey, 908 central jersey, 609 south jersey. Most people I know say the same thing. What do you use as your delineation points?
Who was the crazy woman at the end that I'm now in love with? 
I'm an evil American who has seen it and while I'd be curious to see where they were going with the story, I'll easily move on without issue. 
Im not an expert by any means. But I'm pretty good at the google.\n\nSeems like the MS stands for that specific variant of the M1917 Trench Knife. \n\n"The most common scabbard for the M-1917 and M-1918 trench Knives is the one manufactured by the Jewell Company. This scabbard is pictured below. Note: “Jewell 1918” on the back, the two “MS” stamps, and one “HE” proof stamps each outlined in white. These scabbards did not fare well in the trenches or as surplused sale items after the Army sold them off. That brings us to the next type of scabbard."  - http://www.warrelics.eu/forum/ww1-allies-great-britain-france-usa-etc-1914-1918/u-s-m-1917-m-1918-trench-knives-yes-just-wooden-handled-ones-577741/\n\nYou might want to just hit Find on Page for that one and type in MS. \n\n\nAnother link with a price for one:\n\nhttp://thedogfacesoldier.com/product/wwi-us-m1917-lfc-trench-knife-wscabbard-complete-excellent/\n\n
Somerville. \nAnd yeah, the theory is awesome! although I might sort of pity the person that took the time to work it out.
what's outside of it?
I don't think it's too late, I think it just involves enough leaders in enough communities both online and in the real world to start talking about coming together as a nation. If it were proven that we were duped, some people would stick to their guns and live in denial, but most people are reasonable and don't want strife in their families, jobs, etc. \n\nEveryone likes their side, but no one likes the division. and we can all have our side, but the vitriol and fervor and misguided anger and hate need to go. 
At least we're all safe in the knowledge that Highlander was a documentary shot in real time. 
Not sure if anyone said this and can't check the selection but I remember it being on there once.\n\nAll the president's men. Redford & Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein as they broke watergate. Probably the best one you'll ever see. 
sounds like we're neighbors. 
"Ethics has no party" \n\nWhat a simple, but important lesson that we should all always remember from the President all the way down to the voter.\n\nYou guys are right, this dude is awesome.
You're right.\n\nIt's naive and self-serving for either Republicans or Democrats to say that this is happening only to the other side. \n\nI mean, think of it this way. \n\nArticle gets posted on left leaning site: "GOP fighting new bill that requires Transgender bathroom options in all buildings." \n\nThe left is going to want Trans people to be able to pee. \n\nThen, you jump over to your Right wing site "Dems introduce new bill that requires Transgender only bathrooms in all new and existing buildings." \n\nThe right would flip over this. think about how costly and inconvenient that is. \n\nBoth articles full of their respective party bait. Now, you've got pockets of the internet viciously fighting over this when it's not even a real thing.  \n\nNow, post a couple hundred other articles that week while who knows how many other people, hundreds, thousands, are writing bogus articles, posting bogus opinions on different topics, on different sites. All year long. \n\nThink of the amount of data that just a 5 man team working all year could post. but it's so much more than a 5 man team.\n\nThey've FUELED and GROWN our outrage like hateplants in an angergarden. \n\nEvery time you're on the internet, and you just want to pounce with some "I hate the other side" bullshit, (we all do sometimes), that hatred has most likely been gently brewed and curated over the last decade from news sources that seemed legit. \n\nLet that sink in. How can you really blame the side opposite from you for being angry? \n\n
Look, man. I'm not trying to deflect. I'm saying that it's not a new thing, and everyone has their own version of when it came to prominence and who is responsible and which outlets are the problem, when in reality, pointing fingers isn't going to help us fix things. Maybe you're right. I bet in a way you are, and in others you aren't. We don't live in a world where we are afforded absolutes. So, my question to you is, how does your comment help move all of us, left, right and center forward and bring us back together? 
If i were a big tough fighting woodworker who was recently, through the use of divine and other various forms of magic, turned into a Mannequin, I'd install some of those sweet-ass mortal kombat-esque Poppin Popout wrist knives. Then I'd expand on that formula and make Poppin elbow knives, Poppin knee knives, Poppin foot knives, and even a Poppin Pop-out head knife for headbutts that your enemy will never forget. \n\nPoppin Pop-Out Body Knives^®. When you want a knife to pop out of your body, choose Poppin!\n\n(it is my sincere dream that i listen next week and i hear my branding pay off.)
I'm referring to a time when 973 wasn't a thing yet. 
Since everyone is weighing in: \n\nRocco's in Florence is the best pizza I've had in south jersey. \n\nDelucia's pizza in Raritan is the best in central nj. \n
If the Waldo episode merged with the Be right back episode. The one about the boyfriend's personality in the synthetic body. They put Waldo into a body that didn't quite form right, and then let him go nuts. 
Yeah, I'm not saying that I'm right. Just what I grew up believing. \nI've heard some people refer to New Brunswick as north jersey, which makes no sense to me. 
> Tara Palmer-Tomkinson?\n\noh yes. Thank you so much!
oh, so you mean me? 
It got better... Not much better... but some better. I kept watching in the hopes of another Capalding, but I was not Capaldied again after episode 1. 
They should have just called it Sexy Youngsters in Space. It probably would have caught on. 
They're holding a press conference on Saturday. \nI'm not related to it in anyway other than knowing someone who was slightly involved, but it really fucking bugged me, so I'm posting it here to hopefully get them some extra attention. 
uppies for everyone.
Actually, the term fake news in regards to using media to spread misinformation dates back to the 19th century. This isn't a new thing at all. That being said, I don't feel comfortable laying the blame at either party's doorstep and I invite you to read some of the other threads around here regarding fake news and its affect on interparty relations.\n\n
You can't quit. That's sort of the problem. The more people that give up, the less sane, genuine voices there are. \n\nI know that it can genuinely hurt when you feel like you're constantly fighting. I've been there. but I've sort of pulled a 180. \n\nThe only way to fight now is to engage. I've stopped arguing and started asking questions. and when I ask questions, I find that there aren't so many differences between me and that person. And once you get to that level, it's a place where you can start building. \n\nYou gotta remember, this is like long distance brain washing. For both sides, right and left, most likely. So for as much as the other side is caught up in it, so are we. If we're being drawn apart by a foreign enemy, look at the person you're arguing with not as your opposition, but almost as if you're both superheroes and they've been hit with some mind altering ray. Try to bring them down to place where they want to talk instead of yell, and to really listen instead of listen for opportunities. Won't work all the time, some people are just assholes, but if enough of us worked to change the tone, that's a place where we all can work from. \n\nIf Russia wants to divide us, then stand firm in your willingness to compromise, because at the end of the day, we all love our country, we all know that we want prosperity, liberty, and happiness, and the only way we've ever been able to achieve that is through compromise. Our side is a little too crazy, Their side is a little too crazy, no one should ever get EVERYTHING they want. Everyone should get just enough, and that's how we move forward. \n\n\nI hope that made sense for the most part, I feel like i may have rambled at the end. (EDIT:) and the beginning and the middle apparently. \n\nedit: also a few grammars here and and a few spellings there. 
\nI get what you're saying, but they could explain possible range of repercussions purely from Flynn's perspective as though he acted alone therefore giving the reader and idea of "Just How Much Trouble Michael Flynn is in." As it stands, "Guess How Much Trouble Michael Flynn is in right now! Seriously, Guess!" Is more appropriate. \n\nI personally like "Conspiracy Theorist Proves Conspiracies Exist." 
I was being sarcastic. I agree with you 100%. Everyone that I've shown that article has found it to be shocking.  I can understand why some reporters shy away from investigating it after reading the article and seeing what this reporter went through, but someone's gotta have the balls to do it.\n
You get it. 
As long as you don't call it something horrible like Brentrance.
I genuinely appreciate that, but how does that relate on a geo-political level?\n\nSeriously, does anyone know? I'm curious. And scared. 
You're in for a treat. They've won a bunch of awards.  Raritan used to be a mob town so the Italian food is amazing. Try Espo's if you ever want to eat at an amazing Italian place. 
I can't speak for all of them. but I know some people who may be able to: r/highlander \n\nyeah. it's a thing.
I had an issue like a year and a half ago, and I used Xbox live chat to talk to a rep. The Rep was nice and really tried to be helpful. We were on for a while because it was a weird glitch on their end that still fucking pisses me off to this day, but whatever. \n\nAnyway, about 85% of the way through the conversation, she started acting just a bit strange.  I said something along the lines of, "I can still use my account , right? I just want to chill out and play when I get home." and she replied with "Yes. You will be able to play. I wish I could come play with you." and from there on, it got continuously more and more weirdly flirty. \n\nNot sure who was on the other end. Could have been a guy in another country that wanted to get a good review even though he couldn't do anything, maybe it was an emotionally unstable american girl, or it could have been the girl of my dreams. \n\nEither way, You couldn't make things right after your system fucked me over, and I only review or date chicks that get shit done!
You wouldn't be eating any cheeseburgers. You'd be eating hamburgers. \n\nIs a hot dog considered a sandwich?
Thanks man. I appreciate that. 
If you click the link in the original post, it will take you to a Facebook post by one of the people involved. 
Here's the thing. I'd be considered a liberal, I'm consider myself to be  far left on a lot of issues, moderate on other issues. The majority of my friends are also super liberal. I'd say 75% of the political media and entertainment that  I consume is liberal. and I don't see this this stereotype of coastal liberal snowflakes unless i specifically go looking for it. It's so foreign to me even though it's applied to me. Same thing, I have conservative parents, got a fair amount of conservative friends, and I don't see the "Wife beatin', Racist hick" stereotype in them either.\n\nLike, these horrible stereotypes of the spineless, brat who tries to police speech and the wife beating, racist hick don't represent either of us. But it's a narrative that keeps getting pushed. \n\nWho is pushing that? Because I know that i've never seriously used the term triggered. and as far left as I am, i love using it as a goof. I understand the concept of microaggressions, but i don't see them enough in my day to day life that I would think about it. As for privelige, I get the idea, and i think there's merit to it, but not to the hyperbolic extents that both sides use as a stereotype. \n\nWho is pushing these narratives? Stereotypes allow you to  categorize and dehumanize people. It's propaganda 101. \n\nhttp://changingminds.org/techniques/propaganda/stereotyping.htm\n\nAll i'm asking is that you consider that maybe it's possiblity for a minute or two that it isn't the left's fault, or the right's fault, but maybe we've all been riled up to the point where we hate eachother without knowing one another.  Especially if when I say I'm a liberal, people instantly assume I'm triggered by their microaggressions and that i want them to check their privilege, because that couldn't be farther from the truth. and I'm one person out hundreds of thousands on both sides that don't fit the mold we've forced them into.  Do you think you fit the stereotype of "Right Winger?" \n\nNone of these are attacks, i really just want to know. 
I think it's probably both. It would be a wasted opportunity to not play both sides off of one another. Right?
I just agreed with a majority of what you said. Seriously. I agree that the current establishment politicians from your McConnells to your Reids act like an openly corrupt oligarchical ruling class. \nAnd i think you'd find that a lot of people would feel the same way. Some lean left, and some lean right, but most people see that as the big problem. \nIf i could give you some constructive criticism on your approach, attacking people online isn't really going to make the change that i think you want to make. The human brain is specifically set up to reject attacks. It's not something people can just change, confirmation bias is part of the base operating system. \nIt's a shame that it took 5 or 6 comments back and forth to find out that you and I basically agree. \nThe best way to get people to open their eyes is discourse. You can challenge people's perceptions, and you 100% should, but my suggestion would be to do more like an exchange of ideas and less of a "YOU'RE THE WORST" approach. and I only say this because I've been the "you're the worst" guy before. but Most people aren't the worst. Some are. but not most. most people are just trying to get by and do what seems like the right thing based on what they know.  Good luck on trying to change things, dude.  
This is why I regret giving up on skateboarding. 
Maybe I see it differently because I'm liberal and my mom is very conservative, so we discuss these things. with loud voices sometimes. \n \nWhen it comes to regular entertainment, I think that most creative types are liberals and that just shows in their work. I don't think that the cast of New Girl have a liberal agenda, I think they just write what they know. So, I don't know if there's a solution to what you're saying aside from Equal Time Laws where if someone who tends to lean left writes a 10 minute skit, by law, a conservative's 10 minute skit must air directly before or after. \nI don't think anyone wants that. It borders on censorship. Maybe there's a way, I'm just not smart enough to come up with ti. \n\nWhen it comes to the news, however, I don't think anyone, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, etc. should be swayed by politics. I think that the fact that people have lost faith in them is their own fault, but there's also two other reasons that I think play into it. \n\nOne - Corporate Owned Media cannot be unbiased in 2017. Unfortunately, this is the case. The news should be determined by unbiased journalists, not a profit motive. and I think that's the problem. We've somehow normalized this. On both sides. I think that passing questions to the clinton campaign was reprehensible. At the same time, i believe it was during the Bush administration, Fox staff were being given talking points each day that lined up with the administration's talking points. \n\nTwo - The supreme court ruling that loosened up rules on news reporting. This opened the floodgates on both sides to run biased news stories that were driven by the owners of the company based on their political leaning. It's one of the worst rulings that I believe has ever been made in this country. And i think that's where all of this started. \n\nOnce everyone feels attacked, they are going to attack back, and it's a cycle. \n\nRemember life in 2002? Remember how great that was? When we could differ politically but still be friends with people? The fact that we can't do that anymore is a real problem. It's a country torn in two. It's the possible lead up to a civil war. \n\nI'll give you an example of my thinking here: \nMy mom is a conservative. So conservative that she was into following Pizzagate for a week or two. And because she's my mom, she loves me. but she HATES liberals. HAAAAAATTTEESSS liberals. But i'm a liberal. and like i said, she loves me. or does she hate me? It's this weird situation where we HATE abstract concepts that don't even really apply to most of the people that we categorize that way, and we dehumanize those people, and we hurt eachother. I know tons of right wing people who are great and i love them, and we agree on a few things, and we disagree on others. It's great. \n\nSo, my question back to you: Is it more important that conservatives get their 10 years or whatever of shitting on liberals publicly and on TV, in movies, and songs as payback or is it more important that we work together to fix this shit?
Because you replied to my comment saying "Says the people who voted for hillary clinton" And if you don't see that you are actually the one with the holier than thou attitude, then you're fucking hopeless. \n\nP.S. I voted for Gary Johnson.  
And it's very first form was Feudalism
All that technology and they still managed to make them look so super stylish. Wow. Just look at those lines. I will buy a pair and use them when trying to pick up the ladies. Yep. Things are about to change around here. Nothing but blue skies and magic glasses in my future!
We kinda did
Couldn't tell you. I was genuinely asking. 
Yeah. It's weird that our reaction to these things isn't "how could this happen?" anymore, it's just "This needs to stop." and i don't know when that changed exactly and it's lead us here. 
I've been thinking about it since I was told the story and I think he said yes so he wouldn't have to pay to have the place fixed up. It's the only logical conclusion that I can come up with. Let them do all the work, then just paint over the artwork. Sell the place. Profit. 
Awesome. Always wanted to help with one of these types of posts. \n\nAlso, don't know if your username is related to the band, but i used to see them all the time at shows. \n\nIf it's not related, you should def check them out. If it is related, then you can rest easy in the knowledge that some rando on the internet also has seen a band live. 
I can too. I first realized it when I was a kid taking Karate. They had us flex that muscle for sweet karate chops. \n\nIn all seriousness it was actually Aikido.
It did happen, and you might be right. I think I made a goof posting it here. 
Oh my god. That's such a bummer. Front page of bbcnews: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-38911818
This idea has legs. 
Look, I'm all for someone convincing me beyond a shadow of a doubt that taxation is theft and I do get it to a point, but I find it hard to make the jump from I don't have control over where my tax dollars go based on a flawed system to taxation in practice and in theory is outright theft. \n\nIf I live in someone's house, I pay them rent for general upkeep, emergencies, utilities, etc. If I live in someone's country, state, town etc, I pay my share for those things on a macro scale, trash services, police, etc. I can't live in someone's house and voluntarily not pay rent and stay there. Same with taxes. It's an oversimplification, obviously, but it makes sense on a base level. \n\nI'm just of the opinion that if someone lives here, we all throw money into the pot so no one shoulders the burden alone. We can't rely on the richest people to keep up our infrastructure, military, etc. Thats always what people who are angry about illegal immigration citing, they live here and they don't pay taxes. And yeah, I think that is wrong. (I'm not going to get into a debate on amnesty, naturalization, or deportation.)\n\nSo yeah, that's where I stand, I'd like to see where we differ. 
Every time I see a bad tattoo post, I come looking for this. 
Socialism!  pfftoow. (that's how i spell the action of spitting. (starting now))   \n\nI don't want any of my money going to help other people. It's mine. I'm the one who went to public school for years and studied hard every afternoon at the public library so I could get into a good state college that I could easily commute to! No one helped me along the way, why should I help anyone?! \n\nSo again, i say to you pfttowhooo (that's how i spell the action of spitting, from here on out) 
Hey man, no one will listen to your argument if you're a condescending dick about it by calling people shit like brainwashed drone and it makes your argument ring much more hollow if you instantly resort to that at the first sign of being challenged. If you care about your cause, learn a little fucking PR. 
It's racistly delicious!\n\n(I can say that. That's what mine look like)
I made a base down there as well. However, the next time I started the game, I jumped in my prawn suit and once the moon pool mechanism released it, the suit fell through the map. I was able to swim through after a couple minutes of trying, but my prawn suit is now at the core of the planet, still blinking its beacon as if to say "don't leave me, captain..." \n\nBut I already left. 
Sorry. I misunderstood. 
I take that to mean that you've done multiple heroic things, or am I wrong? What were they? You should do an AMA. 
Yeah. I get that, but that's not what I was asking. 
Looking back, I don't see my parents as having been harsh on me but at the time I absolutely thought that they were monsters. \n\nHowever, I can say that I definitely sought immediate rewards and prioritized my friends over my responsibilities, and still do some of that today as an adult.\n\nI don't know whether my memory just makes it seem better than it was or if they were jerks but I do know this, that link is getting copied and texted to both my mother and father for some of that good old fashioned "you made me this way" banter. 
i'm going by the movie. I'm a connor man, personally. \n

"We were somewhere around Washington D.C. on the edge of the collapse of American democracy when the drugs began to take hold..."
What an annoying title! \n\n>In any other administration with any other president, Flynn would be on very thin ice. At the least, he misremembered — repeatedly — the fact that he had talked about U.S. sanctions against Russia in conversations with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. At the most, well, I'll leave that to your imagination — but suffice to say it's not good.\n\nYeah. Obviously it's not good, but that doesn't answer the question "Just how much trouble is Michael Flynn in?"\n\nThis is what i read the article to find out. is the title a question? Are they asking me to use my imagination to come up with an answer for them?\n
Yeah, it seems like it's just trying to understand where their heads were at. Does anyone know if there was actually any interference or was it just fact finding? 
Thank you. I was about to say they mixed up red and blue. \n\nI've had both a million times and nj pizza (not all of it, but the majority of it) destroys NY pizza every time. 
Wow. The bit that I read of that article is super interesting! Can't wait to read all of it after work. Thanks for sharing!
That'll always be the case. Part of this whole plan is leave the American people with no reference as to what is true. Discrediting the news and the intelligence communities, etc, is the biggest part of that. Once you lose a sense of what's true, you either fall in line or your lose faith in the system. Either way, that's a win for them. \n\nYou're right about digital patriots, but the thing we need to keep in mind is this situation is all borne out of a love for this country. You don't fight for something that you don't care about. You may be misinformed, you may even be an asshole about it, but it's all from a pure place of patriotism. Unfortunately, there are so many ways to be a patriot, that we need to find a common ground for our patriotism. We need to embrace bipartisanship if only for then next year or two, but ideally more. We need to focus on who we are, our core beliefs, like freedom, liberty, equality. Everything else is just a personality trait and we can figure those out as we go. 
I swear to god. If we get a Capaldi / Corden episode I will be the happiest man on the planet. 
I'm from jersey. Used to play here a lot. Most Richmond acts did (usually the night before they played NYC).  Definitely a great band. Worked at a venue when I was younger so I'd see them whenever they around. I'd either be working the show or I'd go by to check them out. \n\nNow we're officially good music buddies. 
So basically he's the next Trump advisor.
They aren't my pictures and there wasn't an official story yet. I don't want to just take someone else's photos like that. However, here's a screenshot from the post: http://imgur.com/a/3XWMR
I can't remember if they addressed his, but does he not feel pain? \n\nI mean, I could take another arm and nail it into the base of my spine for rear sword protection and cool spin attacks, but it would hurt real bad and I'd probably have trouble walking for at least an hour, possibly longer.\n\nI do like the idea of him using tools like chisels and sandpaper to shape a hunky body, but considering how it would feel to use something like a planer on your skin, I might a monster for enjoying the idea. \n\n
No one ever invites Todd but somehow he shows up at every party!
I've heard that,  but I never understood why. 
I always look a woman in the eyes when I speak to her, it's just plain rude to stare at her stumps. 
Don't forget Bob Ferguson as well. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ferguson_(politician)
Can I get him to consult the next time I need to split up with someone? 
It's such a shame that we've progressed so far as a society, yet our greatest minds still don't understand the forces that make this possible.
This is a serious question without any hidden meaning, or ulterior motive. When exactly did you start to feel like you had to constantly be on the offensive when it comes to democrats? And is it all democrats, hillary democrats, democrat politicians, or what? and if you feel like the republicans and the democrats are basically on the same level ethically, why attack them for being unethical? 
You're very right.  \nI'm just saying that the small amount of evidence that i've seen seems to loosely connect, but I'm just a schmuck on the internet and no one should take me seriously on my Global Theorycrafting. \n\nHowever, I think it is very important to delineate between "Fake News" as an elegant and well funded PsyOps campaign with obvious success, vs Fake News as in people who aren't telling you the truth that you want to hear. (On both sides) 
Me too! That was my first thought. I can't believe I'm about to say this but... I can understand earth being flat (that made my stomach hurt to type) but what does he think happens after the clouds?
This whole thread is great. You guys have no idea how entertained I'm. 
Yes there is evidence he colluded with Russia.  \n\nHe held a private meeting with the Ambassador to Russia and then denied it under oath.  That Ambassador is now dead by the way.  \n\nNow this might be circumstantial evidence but it is pretty damning and, under any circumstances, would be enough to open a full investigation.  
Reading this it seems like the only policy goals of the Establishment is to prevent the policy goals of the Progressives from happening.  \n\nThis is why Hillary lost.  She had no ideas.  Nothing.  Period.  Her entire campaign message was "Bernie Sanders can't deliver on his ideas and Trump is mean.  Vote for me and you'll get more of the same old crap you've been spoon-fed for 20 years."  
I also believe that the POTUS's taxes are required to be public knowledge.  \n\nWhatever he is hiding has an expiration date of April 15th 2018.  
The Right often uses the phrase "Gay Agenda" but they never seem to explain what they think the Gay Agenda is?  \n\nIs the gay agenda to take over the world?  Is the gay agenda to turn everyone gay?  Is the gay agenda to enslave all the straight people?  \n\nFurthermore if there is a "gay agenda" there must also be a heterosexual agenda which is obviously opposed to the gay agenda right??  What is that?  I'm straight and I'm not even sure what my agenda is!?!?!?!\n\nFrom what I can see the "Gay Agenda" is have equal rights and to not have to hide their sexuality.  
Yes that's the purpose.  Its a conspiratorial collaboration.  \n\nWikileaks already exposed this so stop trying to pretend like its a crazy theory.  It's a known fact.  The DNC and the Corporate Media work together to herd voters.  
Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were the same.  
It was investigated after Clinton deleted 30,000 emails and refused to hand over her server to the FBI for 3 weeks.  \n\nShe also lied repeatedly about it.  \n\nIn addition to the wholesale destruction of evidence your logic is also based on the assumption that the conclusions of Law Enforcement are always correct.  
The purpose of the article is herding.  The Media is attempting to "herd" the Bernie voters back into the DNC by constantly writing articles about how Bernie disagrees with Trump.  \n\nThey never print articles about how Bernie disagrees with Establishment Democrats...or articles about the policy posiions of Bernie Sanders.  Those things drive the wedge further between Progressive Dems and Establishment Dems.  \n\nIt's all propaganda tactics.  
I was a teacher.  Sorry.  When people are wrong I correct them.  It's a habit.  
She had no campaign to speak of.  She did 1 unscripted television interview with Jorge Ramos and he was blacklisted for the remainder of the race bc he asked about her email server.  \n\nShe never spoke to the public or the media because her entire campaign was conducted under the lies of her email investigation.  She couldn't risk being asked about it and then perjuring herself so she had to avoid the press completely unless their were her allies.  
First sentence calls it a 'Faux Scandal' which right away reveals this to be a propaganda article since it was a very real scandal which prevented Clinton from hosting a single press conference during her entire campaign for President. She only did 1 unscripted interview the entire campaign as well, with Jorge Ramos, and she got extremely upset when pressed on the issue.   
You're not using the word sensitive correctly.  \n\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/sensitive
Literally nobody reading this thinks you explained it already.  \n\nYou just accused me of posting fake news without any facts to back up your claims and expected that to be sufficient.  Then you dodged my challenge to explain how Clinton isn't guilty of fraud...obviously because you cannot explain it.  
*Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?* \n\n*The Shadow knows...*
It is pretty hostile to Bernie supporters.  \n\nI've been posting here for weeks and still can't get the 10 minute timer to turn off.  
yeah that's what my coworkers said when I told them about the story and my comment.  \n\nIt's true.  The horse has already left the barn.  
OK.  Reported.  \n\nI find it very amusing that you cannot debate and must resort to insults, straw man arguments and changing the subject rather than engage me on the issues.  \n
English class is important.  
No the comment belongs here with the actual topic.  
This article is ridiculous.  \n\nI'm gonna go ahead and say they are grossly misrepresenting what this bill does.  
There is no Alt-Left.  \n\nit's a term which was created by people like Sean Hannity as a propaganda technique to combat the Alt-Right...a term which was invented by Right Wing Fascists to describe themselves...but has now become mainstream.  
What fake news?  I didn't peddle anything.  Try to make sense.  Irrationally shouting 'NO YOU'RE A FAKE NEWS PEDDLER!" at the top of your lungs is not winning the argument buddy.  \n\nUse facts.  Clinton lied repeatedly.  Obama lied.  Title 18 US Code 371.  Read it and then explain to me why Clinton isn't guilty of Conspiracy to defraud the USA.  
Does wearing INT boosting items effect the proc rate of Idiot Savant?  \n\nFor instance should I wear the Ushanka (spelled that wrong I know) Hat which is +1 to INT on my character who has 3 INT and rank 2 of Idiot Savant or is that actually hurting my ability to gain XP fast?  
We don't need an immigration debate.  We need a debate about why employers are never charged with a felony for hiring illegal immigrants.  \n\nThe day we throw a billionaire in prison for having an illegal immigrant housekeeper is the day this entire immigration debate ends.  Illegal Immigration exists because it benefits the wealthy and there is almost no penalty for being caught.  \n\nMake the penalty jail time and it will end immediately.  No debate needed.  
Everyone knows that the Berniebro's were really trolls supporting Hillary or Trump.  Their mission was to pretend to be Bernie supports and be so offensive and rude that any undecided people watching would not want to be associated with them.  
False.  CNN is owned by extremely wealthy people who are far more frightened of Socialism than they are of Fascism.  \n\nThe 1% will always prefer candidates like Clinton and Trump over candidates like Sanders which is why CNN worked so hard to provide Trump with tons of airtime but refused to show Sanders.  
Before another person cries about how Gabbard met with Assad...lets review this gem from 2013! \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10283045/John-Kerry-and-Bashar-al-Assad-dined-in-Damascus.html
Your point is irrelevant.  Her email setup would have been discovered eventually.  It was simply unfortunate for Clinton that they discovered it before her campaign started.  \n\nI voted Democrat in every election since 2000 by the way...except this one.  Voted Green Party.  I even voted for Clinton in the 2008 Primary.  So stop pretending this is a partisan issue.  
This article cannot be taken seriously as it starts off calling the Clinton Email Scandal a "faux scandal" which is an obvious lie.  \n\nI didn't bother reading the rest of it since it's obvious propaganda.  Clinton and her staff are, at the very least, guilty of violation of Title 18 US Code 371 which is Conspiracy to Defraud the United States of America.  The purpose of her email setup was to circumvent the Freedom of Information Act and prevent the People of the USA from seeing how Clinton conducted business as Sec of State.  \n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371\n\nShe told repeated lies about her email setup.  Even Obama lied about not knowing about it.  If there was no scandal why did Clinton and the Obama Administration work so hard to cover it up?  \n\nEdit: If you're gonna downvote me grow some balls and say why instead of anonymously downvoting me.  Clearly you cannot dispute the facts.  \n
False. CNN didn't show a single of Bernie's rallies but showed numerous Trump rallies and even showed an empty podium for 30 minutes rather than show a Bernie rally.  \n\nThey didn't mock him incessantly.  
That's the way to bet.  \n\nAnonymous source = bullshit story usually.\n\nWaPo also has a 600 million dollar contract with the CIA so most anything they print can be assumed to be CIA planted info.  
By Clinton?  \n\nTitle 18 US Code 371 = Conspiracy to defraud the USA
Naa you are thinking of John Kerry.  \n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10283045/John-Kerry-and-Bashar-al-Assad-dined-in-Damascus.html
You're obviously mistaken and I highly doubt you read any of them based on your comment.  It was clearly shown that the media was conspiring with the DNC and the Hillary Campaign throughout the election and before it.  \n\nhttp://www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com/
I didn't vote for Trump.  Changing the subject again.  This is getting really pathetic.  Just give up if you can't debate me.  
You don't expect them to let Bernie Sanders talk on Corporate media do you?  \n\nnever gonna happen.  
Russia influenced the election by exposing the truth about Hillary and the DNC.  \n\nFact.  
What's really funny is that you cannot answer the question and instead are attempting to troll me.  It's painfully obvious to everyone reading this that you are incapable of debating.  
I haven't seen any numbers on this.  I think it's something the Media makes up to explain Hillary's loss.  Not an ounce of truth to it except the occasional anecdote from interviewing a random guy in some random town.\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say 80% of Bernie supporters voted for Clinton.  15% voted for Stein or Johnson and maybe 5% voted for Trump.  
Not a TNG character but Trump reminds me of Gul Dukat a lot.  
What's infowars?
It's illegal because the teachers have direct authority over the students.  This could be abused.  \n\nStatutory Rape also applies to adults.  The prison system for instance.  It is statutory rape for a prison guard to have sex with a prisoner.  Even if the student/prisoner is willing...even if they initiate the act...the fact that both parties consented is totally irrelevant.  
Wow that article was a bunch of crap.  Spin city.  Also the author is blatantly Anti-Bernie which you can see from his other pro-establishment tripe like this one:  \n\nhttp://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/02/27/the-fake-factional-war-over-the-dnc-chair/\n\nHe even refers to Bernie Supporters by the pejorative term "berniebros" which is a dead giveaway that he's hack.  \n\n\nNow if you actually read the small portion of text including in the article you posted it clearly says that it is for the importation of "SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRUGS FROM CANADA".    \n\n\n
wow that was mature
The GOP made a strategic decision in the late 60's.  They looked at the Demographics and decided that even if all the blacks in the nation voted Democrat they still wouldn't have even remotely enough votes to outnumber all the racist white people.  \n\nSo they decided to actively court the votes of racist whites with policies like 'Separate but equal" and opposition to "forced bussing" and of course opposition to entitlement programs which they labeled as "free stuff for blacks" etc etc.  \n\nThere strategy has worked well until recently.  Demographics are against them now with minorities making up a bigger and bigger share of the electorate.  They are now struggling and I believe Trump represents the final death throes of the Republican Party.  
why would they appreciate it?  
the story about corporate democrats voting down his drug amendment was not covered by any of the major news outlets.  \n\nHere's a shocking example of them covering something he did today...but as you can see by reading the article it's actually an article about rehabilitating Corey Booker who took a huge hit when the public discovered he voted against the exact thing he is now supporting.  \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/28/bernie-sanders-takes-another-swing-at-big-pharma-with-bill-to-allow-drug-imports/?utm_term=.7ca314423900#comments\n\nThe media attempted to hide Booker's original "No" vote on the amendment so now they are going to introduce legislation which will not go anywhere in the GOP congress and then they can claim Booker supported it.  It's Sanders's bill but the longest quotation in the article is from Booker.  \n\nBooker is going to be the nominee in 2020 if you don't know already.  
I used to work for Old Dominion Freight Lines which is based out of North Carolina.  \n\nWhen I first started and you have to watch those stupid training and safety videos right?  I'll never forget that in the 30 minute video about the history of the Company they mentioned it was 'non-union workplace" 3 times.  \n\nI remember thinking "Isn't this illegal?"  It was obvious intimidation.   
I think its the only possible way of looking at things.  Corporations care about profits.  Period. Full stop.   There is no "and" after profits.  \n\n
Projection.  A common psychological defense mechanism.  \n\nSo you admit Clinton is guilty of Conspiracy to defraud the USA then?  I am going to assume you are conceding the point since I've asked at least 5 times for you to answer and you dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge each time.   \n\n
I'm just correcting you.  
Why wouldn't making a policy exactly like Denmark's work?  What's different about sick people in Denmark as opposed to sick people in the USA that means we have to pay more money for worse outcomes?  
Read wikileaks.  
Of course that's how it happens.  One phone call by one person and a story doesn't air.  \n\nYou also are ignoring the fact that the Board has placed people in leadership positions specifically based on how they think about certain issues.  Interviews for the CEO position of a news organization like this are very focused on politics, the CEO's views etc.  \n\nThey would never even consider hiring a CEO that would cover Bernie Sanders fairly in the first place.  So really they don't have to make that decision.  They asked that question during the interview and already go the answer they wanted.  
More americans voted for other candidates or didn't vote at all then supported Hillary.  40% of voters didn't vote and of the 60%  that did vote...Hillary didn't even win a majority.  More voted for Trump, Stein and Johnson.  \n\nStop with "the country supported Hillary".  It's not true.  \n\nOther than that your post is spot on.   
Words are free.  \n\n
What a nonsense article.  Let's review his points.  Liberals aren't allowed to criticize Islam because: \n\n1- They don't any middle eastern languages\n2- America did nasty things before too
I'm sure some of his soon-to-be fellow prison inmates will do their best to convince him sex with men is better too.  
Source?  \n\nI suspect your source is Corey Booker's twitter account.  
Couldn't help but notice that you once again dodged my challenge to explain how Clinton isn't guilty of fraud...obviously because you cannot explain it...and are instead trying to change the subject and launch ad hominem attacks on me to cover for the fact that you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about.  \n\n
Nobody is talking about Benghazi here buddy.  \n\nremove your downvote since you clearly made a mistake and thought this was an entirely different topic.  \n\n
Like who?
Only to kids who were telling some other kids they were wrong when, in fact, the first kid was totally wrong and the other kid was right.  
I didn't vote for Trump.  Not sure why you think I did other than I said something you didn't agree with.  Then you compared me to a white supremacist.    
If you think I made it up then you should be concentrating on disproving my statement instead of changing the subject to CPAC and whatever else your nonsensical response was trying to reference.  Something about deep lines and Mussolini...I dunno it didn't make sense to me.  \n\nIt was pretty hilarious that a layperson tried to tell a licensed English Teacher that he lacked reading comprehension skills though.  That was even more embarrassing than your world salad post.   
I'm fairly certain that the US Government has no ability to enforce this on tribal lands.  \n\nSome southwestern native American cultures rely on powerful hallucinogenic plants called Peyote as part of their religious rituals and they are protected from prosecution as long as they do it on Tribal Lands.  
That's why the only person who is to blame really is Hillary herself.  She was a bad candidate who ran a HORRIBLE campaign and the only reason it was close was because of the huge amount of help she received from the Media.  \n\nWithout the Media supporting Clinton I think she would have lost by a MUCH higher margin.  Millions of votes. \n
Best game series of all time.  2 was my favorite.  I love doing the WIT trials.  
Why are you assuming anyone who disagrees with you is a Trump supporter?  Stop the tribalism.  
One step closer to Idiocracy.  
I don't care what phrases Bannon uses.  It's not meaningless.  The Corporate Media is Media that is owned by Billionaires and corporations.  It's mass market media who's content is controlled by a small group of individuals and thus easily manipulated.  \n\nOh and I see it as exactly the opposite way as you...\n\nThese threads are also full of people attacking Bernie supporters and thus supporting Trump.    \n\nObviously clinging to the out of touch, corrupt, establishment rather than embracing the ideas and energy of the Progressive Movement is what enabled Trump to win the Presidency in the first place.  By further snubbing Bernie supporters with the election of Perez as DNC chair the Democratic party is signaling that they have no intention of indulging the desires of Bernie voters.  This will cause many of them to vote 3rd party and Trump to win reelection.  \n\nIt's not the time for these tactics.  They don't help your cause.  
Are you talking to me?
Reported for trolling.  
Corey Booker changed his vote pretty darn quick after feeling the Bern.  Now he's a co-sponsor because of the beating he took when he voted against this exact legislation (in amendment form) a few weeks ago.  \n\nThe Corporate Media is largely ignoring this story of course.  I was shocked to see that WaPo covered it but when I read the WaPo article I realized what they did.  The WaPo article is actually about Corey Booker  being a hero who stands up to Trump and not about Bernie Sanders despite the fact that Sander's authored the legislation.  The longest quote in the WaPo article is from Booker criticizing Trump and not from the guy who wrote and introduced the bill...typical Corporate Media spin.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/28/bernie-sanders-takes-another-swing-at-big-pharma-with-bill-to-allow-drug-imports/?utm_term=.2a0d3f2d8a1f\n\n
Do you always continue to argue long after being proven wrong?  
Not true.  Hillary is worse.  Hillary has the support of the Shadow Government and the Billionaires.  She lies as easily as a fish swims and the Media lets her get away with it bc the Media is owned by the Billionaires.   \n\nTrump is a chimp in a business suit.  He doesn't lie.  He just contradicts facts or ignores them. He's too stupid and too isolated to get away with anything truly dangerous to the American People.  
Once again...I didn't vote for Trump.  I voted Democrat for 16 years and I also raised tens of thousands of dollars for Democrats when I was a professional fundraiser for the party.  \n\nStop pretending this is a partisan issue.  Stop downvoting people because you cannot dispute their facts.  
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371\n\n"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both." \n\nExplain how Clinton is not guilty of conspiring to defraud the State Department and the People of the USA out of the official records they are entitled to under US Law?
I was wondering if you had a source that could actually prove that Booker's reasoning was justified or if he merely made it up as an excuse after the fact because he got eviscerated on social media for his vote.  \n\nI suspect he made it up completely.  Nobody I know of has ever seen the text of the amendment so it's easy for a politician to lie and say it contained no "safeguards" whatever that means.    
I met many Hillary posters online who also regurgitated GOP propaganda about Bernie being a "Communist" and never having "a real job", vacationing in Russia, Universal healthcare/College education is too expensive, etc etc.   \n\nVowing to support Trump after it was proven that Hillary cheated and the DNC rigged the primary is not exactly a shock though.  I would never have voted for Hillary even if I was paid but I seriously considered voting for Trump just out of spite.  I didn't though.  I decided that, if I was going to vote for a loser of a candidate, I might as well vote for the one who shares my values and I voted for Jill Stein. 
How about the Republican and Democratic Parties simply make this a requirement to be their nominees?  \n\nNo legal issues.  No Congressional fight.  No Trump Veto.  \n\nDone and Done.  
Another example of the Corporate Media ignoring Bernie Sanders unless they are writing a hit piece about him or he's criticizing Trump.  
Not the first time the GOP has tried to codify this kind of horrifically unethical behavior into law.  \n\nWhat kind of person would want to protect doctors who lie to their patients and trick them into having severely disabled children which they cannot afford to care for?\n\nI'll tell you...Religious Conservatives.  
You mean discouraging right?  \n\nI think there would be no need for an immigration debate if employers faced jail time for hiring illegals.  \n\nThey simply wouldn't hire illegals.  Without jobs there is no incentive for illegals to come here or stay here.  They will all leave the country when it becomes clear there are no jobs for them.  \n\nProblem solved.  No debate.  No Wall.  No money spent.  
Keep trying to change the subject some more...maybe I'll fall for it.  \n\nWhataboutism?  LOL \n\nWhat about she wasn't convicted!\nWhat about the FBI knows more than you!\nWhat about anything I can think of rather than explain how Clinton isn't guilty of Fraud!
huh?
yeah I saw that too.  Still just anecdotal evidence.  The corporate media DESPERATELY wants to convince the idiot public that Sanders supporters are simply the mirror image of Trump supporters.  \n\nThey tried the racist/sexist angle for this exact reason.  The entire "berniebro" made up nonsense was part of this campaign to label Sanders as an extremist.  
Logic Fail:  The absence of a conviction does not mean a crime wasn't committed. \n\nIf this is your line of thinking you must believe OJ Simpson was innocent and no bankers committed crimes in the 2008 Crash right?  \n\nWhy not take a stab at explaining how Clinton isn't guilty of Conspiracy to commit Fraud under Title 18 US Code 371?   It's clear to me that they are guilty.  \n\nPS the downvoting thing is insane.  It prevents people from speaking their mind since they have to worry about being ganged up on and downvoted and losing their posting privileges.  
Another response made.  Another opportunity to answer the question ignored.  Another attempted subject change made.  
And here is another example of the Corporate Media only covering Sanders when he criticizes Trump.  \n\nThis is getting really pathetic and obvious.  Just a few days ago somebody on this forum was telling me my observations were wrong.  \n\nLiterally every story in the last few weeks posted on this thread which mentions Sanders in the title is also ALWAYS about him saying something negative about Trump.  \n\nThe Corporate Media will never give Sanders positive press about anything else. 
Correction:  The topic is an article that compares mike pences improper use of email to Hillary Clinton's improper use of email.  \n\n
Just wait until millennial leftists learn about this.  \n\nGet ready for "Occupy Wall Street" to become "Occupy Main Street".  People will be camped out on lawmakers lawns for months.  \n\nBe careful what you wish for gun nuts...\n\n
Yep.  He killed the amendment.  This legislation isn't going anywhere and Booker knows it.  The GOP (along with other Corporate Dems) will block it...or maybe Trump will veto it...and it will never become law.  Booker being a co-sponsor is just a ploy to rehab his image.  They are grooming him to be the 2020 nominee.  \n\nWhen the chips were down, and there was a real opportunity to insert this law as an amendment during the budget reauthorization, Booker voted against it and helped kill it.  I applaud Sanders for re-introducing this law as a stand alone bill because it forces the Corporate Stooges to go on record being against it but we all know it's not going to pass this congress.  \n\n
Simple thing you can do...scroll through this thread and look at any story with a headline that mentions Sanders.  \n\nI can almost guarantee that the substance of that article will be negative about Sanders, Sanders criticizing Trump or both.   There is one from earlier today about Sanders laughing at Trump.  \n\nNo articles are ever written by Corporate Media which are complementary to Sanders unless he is saying something negative about Trump.  Even then...some are still negative about Sanders.  Corporate Media has a blacklist order on Sanders.  They are not allowed to discuss his policies positions, his work in Congress, his speeches, etc.  
I don't think I've ever read a story from WaPo what cites a named source.  
Hey I got a question:  In survival mode it is VERY easy to get huge penalties to INT just by not drinking water.  With 3 INT and being Dehydrated I can get my INT to be like -5.  \n\nJust from anecdotal observation I believe this greatly increases the Proc Rate of Idiot Savant but I was wondering if there was any data on that?
False.  More people voted for other candidates.  40% of eligible voters didn't like any of the candidates and stayed home.  \n\n"None of the above" - was the clear winner in 2016.  Hillary came in second and Trump was 3rd.  
They should have had access to them in the first place.  The FOIA exists so we will have access to the communications of officials like the Sec of State.  \n\nBy intentionally hiding them...Clinton violated the law I cited above.  It was a pretty easy case to prosecute.  
Alright, you can continue to spout a false narrative of what is wrong with the American political system if you want. And no i dont see a problem with someone actively convincing voting age adults to play politics instead of throwing their vote away. You can say its their concious voting or they are voting with their heart, and thats cute and all, but a vote is a practical political tool not a canvas for you to express your opinions. Its meant to actually do things.
There are 3.5 millions muslim americans. How often do you think that christians kill bc of there religion in the us vs muslims? 
Will be in iron fist 
Been playing hearthstone for a couple years. Switched recently to a different digital tcg. Couldnt be happier.

Read the article.  He's critical of Trump in it.  In addition the title of the article was specifically chosen to insinuate that Trump and Sanders are alike.  \n\nCorporate Media will only print stories that are negative about Sanders or stories which involve Sanders being critical of Trump.  This is because the owners of Corporate Media oppose Sanders and his policies.  They will never print positive stories about Sanders and the work he does in government.  I used the example of his amendment to lower prescription drug prices which Sanders introduced and was voted down by 13 Democrats.  That story was not covered by CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, Fox News, etc etc.  If you google it the first page of responses is places like "The intercept", "Democracynow", Sanders senate webpage and "Slate.com".  \n\nSanders is blacklisted from Corporate Media because of his policies.  They actively worked against him in the primary.  They were more than happy to show legions of people at Trump rallies because it fit their narrative but they refused to even once show the numerous 30k+ attendance rallies which Bernie Sanders held.  This is how propaganda works.  Control the flow of information.  If people have no other information to go on...they will believe you when you go on TV and say "Bernie Sanders is unelectable.  Bernie Sanders cannot defeat the GOP.  Bernie Sanders doesn't have support from minorities."  etc etc.  \n\nThis CNN article was intentionally written so the reader will gain two pieces of information from it:  1- Sanders and Trump are alike on Trade Policy. 2 - Sanders thinks Trump is a hypocrite.    
awesome thanks man.  
In what way?  Contradicting me is easy.  Explain how Clinton isn't guilty of conspiracy to defraud the USA?  Here is the law:  \n\n"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."\n\nThe entire purpose of her server was to avoid the Freedom of Information Act.  That is a crime.  Right?
Where do I put in my application to be a paid professional protester? That job sounds dope.
He could easily have been talking about the police, they could have one plainclothes cop throw a rock and they could "justify" arresting everyone and taking their stuff. 
Right, so all cops have to do is send in one of their own to kick over a trash can and suddenly the protest "became violent" and they have carte blanch to do mass arrests.  Wasn't there also a provision in this piece of dreck to start doing asset forfeiture of everyone involved as well?  Not that they really needed an excuse to do that before, but...
It's like minority report. Apparently they know who will riot before riots occur. I can't wait to meet their precogs.\n\nOh, they don't have any and they're just imagining a worst case scenario as an excuse to lock up peaceful protesters? I see.
Sure does.
I can finally put my poli sci degree to use! (I mean, i use it all the time, but not make money)
This is terrifying. The Republicans should all be called out as anti-democratic. They seek power over everything else. 
They are, and always have been during my lifetime, authoritarian. They talk a lot about freedoms from government and then every chance they get they crack down on the opposition in scary, fascist, antidemocratic ways.
Sounds like fascism to me.
>Police may be given power to arrest anyone involved in a peaceful demonstration that is merely suspected of turning violent.\n\n>“You now have a situation where you have full-time, *almost professional* agent-provocateurs that attempt to create public disorder.\n\nBy "almost professional", they mean, "not professional, not full-time, not paid. AKA, Registered voters in their districts voicing disapproval at town hall meetings given by these same GOP politicians.
Unconstitutional, plain and simple. 
Yes liberals are the ones denying climate change and making up voter fraud. Get your head outta yer bum mate.
Awww, he doesnt even even deny that he hates the constitution, our little american fascists are growing up. 
We can dream, my friend.
You at least need to intimately understand what is *tier 1*. I think tier 2 in eternal is surprisingly viable, but you have to play those types of decks when the tier 1 shell that beats you isn't popular and the tier 1 shell you beat is.\n
Yeah. No russian ties here. Just trump stating the kremlin party line at america and her allies (nato) detrement. And trump hiring flynn who may have broke the law and undermined the sitting president at the time in order to reassure the russians that their military actions in ukraine would be essentially rewarded. And paul manafort who helped run trumps campaign and also helped keep a russian backed ukrainian leader in power. And that trump openly called for the russians to hack his political enemy and then THEY DID IT. Trump just asked all agencies and repub congress people to play down ties between his people and the russians, but sure this congress person hasnt been asked to do that, he just did it because he really cares. Lol chaffetz is investigating a twitter account and republicans have got their fingers in their ears. If, and when, this blow up im going to laugh at all the trump supporters who called us conspiracy theorists while believing in spirit cooking and pizzagate. There is pleanty of circumstantial evidence that only makes sense if trump is either incredibly stupid and harmful to our country or a traitor and incredibly harmful. We'll see soon enough. 
This disheartened me to an extent i cant quite put into words.
It was limewire or some shit. Not the same as torrenting. I know i downloaded it, cant remember the details.
You realize that like 60% of people would hate that and thats why it would never work?
Also, you know that voter id was cooked up by conservative think tanks in order to win elections, right? It was never about elections security. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/28/republicans-admit-voter-id-laws-are-aimed-at-democratic-voters.html https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/some-republicans-acknowledge-leveraging-voter-id-laws-for-political-gain.html
The paperbacks should be collected bound volumes which is several issues. Variants are purely for looks, they are just different covers. If you just want to read the veiwcomic is a good place, or buy them off amazon, or ask your local library!\n
You realize that washington post is a conservative media outlet founded by a cult leader, right?  So maybe take a look at the plank in your eye? I'm apolitical scientist who studied voter fraud for my thesis. So, yeah it's not real. I've written and read plenty on the subject. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times#Political_stance     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Myung_Moon
You realize federal judges have ruled against it many, many times right? Including conservative federal judges, right? Or is it all us vs them with you? 
Omg go to college. Get off right wing radio news media nd get facts from people who care about the truth not getting votes!
Also, we know congress doesnt care about financial crimes, so that wont happen unless he is sued from outside the government.
You know how many malaria and whooping cough deaths we have?!?! Almost some!!!
Uhg id have to find it. I wrote it 4 years ago and have changed computers since then. Might be able to find my sources though as i think i saved them onto my google chrome profile as bookmarks. Ill post later if i find either.
Can ultimate's not be responded to? If so that's lame. \n
Wahhhh trump is perfect hillary is the devil. *looks at facts* I dont see anything. *westworld music cues*
Lol k. I think their tens of thousands of accurate stories and 119 pulizter prize winners accumilated over the past century and half beg to differ.
Ree im /u/kelsoATX and i wont act in defense of the constitution if means standing up for people i disagree with.
Cool. It might just have been them drawing well and me drawing poorly. Plus im new so wasnt sure how to play the matche up! Thanks!
Nope. 
Or the whitehouse press secretary? Or Trump? 
Do you understand context?
Tracer was so bad in qm and low rung hl. She was easy enough to kill if you could stun lock her with 3 stuns. Good luck doing that in qm or low hl.
Man, I wish they could be responded to. I get why they aren't, but I also like the idea of using a torch to make you waste 6-8 mana and a turn.
No we are telling you when you call people things like that there a consequences. Asshat
Https://Typicalgirls.bandcamp.com we are currently working on a full length but we have 3 eps until then! 
Being downvoted for losing faith in a position that a literal con artist, rapist, racist, dumbass can get. Right. 
Thanks for calling me smart! Do you knwo that age has nothing to do with logic and attacking me, my knowledege of the constitution or my age doesnt actually logically refute anything ive said? Also, i went back to school and im not young, dipshit.
Omg yes! Russia has done NOTHING in the past decade to warrant such hate. They never shut down banks in estonia , or invaded georgia. They didnt anmex lands from ukraine, or intercede on assads behalf when he was about to fall. They didnt hack the dnc, they havent murdered political opponents, they havent passed laws that outlaw peaceful protests, or sold off russian wealth for kleptocrats. They havent passed anti gay legislation, or passed laws requiring you to be christian. They didnt drug their olympic teams and get banned.  Putin isnt suspected of stealing 45-75 billion dollars from his own people, and they havent raided the offices of human rights watch NGOs and thrown them out of the country for defending gay peoples right to exist. Russia also isnt the most corrupt country in the world with the largest income inequality in the world with the highest taxes on their impoverished. Oh wait...yeah theyve done all of those things... the reason that I fear russia and trumps ties to russia is because ive been paying attention to what russia has been re-becoming for the past 10 years. Putin openly calls for a re emergence of the soviet union, and hes openly said given the oppor tunity he would take back the lands they lost by force. So you keep listening to what trump and russia tell you, and ill keep watching what actions they are taking. 
Weird. My phrasing must have been off, bc you and I agree. I was making the point that, in the US at least, Christians kill more often for their religion than Muslims do. 
They did lol can you not see it? *westworld music plays backwards*
Lol yes voting should require sacrifice and hard work /s
Lol. Some 14 year old isnt going to be able to see this bc of the rating then he'll just torrent or stream it a week later. And somehow his parents will find out and ground him. I know bc i did that with austin powers 2    
Youre right im just a law student. When would i have time to have read the constituion? 
Like how he said he would leave weed up to the states, but now is walking that back. Or how he would drain the swamp of curroption, still hasnt released his tax returns, and has the richesr cabinet in history. Or how he shamed Obama for vacations but has already spent 3 million on going back to mar-a-lago 4 out of the 6 weekends as president. Or how he said he had a secret plan to defeat isis in thirty days, but hey, wait, its been 6 weeks no update. You got duped, coward. 
She did it for conservatives and is a conservative. Conservatives *after* she fucking lied us into a war gave her a job at fox news and now she has a job at conservative newsmax. So, that really reflects more poorly on conservatives on actively supporting her while lying (the bush administration) and after she lied (media organizations that hired her or are currently her employer) than it does the nyt for believing their reporter did her fucking job with a shred of morality *shhhh*

What if I told you a media outlet running hit pieces against a politician isnt sufficient reasoning for the president to hamper the first amendment privledges of that organization? Did that blow your mind? Bc, sadly for you I'm sure, we dont get to take away constitutional rights of people we disagree with just because we dont like what they are saying. 
I want a congressional investigation into trump ties not impeachment without due process. I think there is enough evidence to warrent at least that. His national security advisor got fired for breaking the law (sure a law no one has ever gone to jail for breaking but a law) that, to me, needs congressional oversight. Do you not think there is enough evidence of truml russian ties to *at least* have congress appoint a special prosecutor? 
Ooooooohhhh i want *makes grabby motion towards game*
Triggered!
Ok. Couldn't find the paper. Have some links, most are dead articles now or were journals that were behind paywalls that I had access to while at school. These are the four I have left that work.

I WAS STUCK IN MMR HELL ON MAIN ACCOUNT THAT HAS 100% OF HEROES AND DOZENS OF MOUNTS AND TRIPLE DOZENS OF SKINS. SWITCHED TO A SMURF ACCOUT NOW HAVE 500 GAMES WITH IT AND I HAVE 1200 HIGHER MMR ON THE SMURF. AT LEAST LET ME RESET MY MMR, I DONT CARE ABOUT EVRYONE ELSE'S!! I JUST WANT TO PLAY DECENT GAMES ON THE ACCOUNT IVE SPENT WELL OVER 100 DOLLARS ON!
YEAH I DID. STILL PLAY BOTH ACCOUNTS, IF I HAVE 3-4 FRIENDS PLAYING I PLAY MY MAIN. MY "PLACEMENT" MATCHES IN DECEMBER PUT ME IN SILVER. MY SMURF ACCOUNT IS DIAMOND. I DOUBT I IMPROVE THAT MUCH IN THE 2 WEEKS BETWEEN MY PLACEMENT MATCHES ON MAIN AND SMURF. THANKS THOUGH!
I used to love that place.
Hmm, I'm 45 and heard it quite clearly.
Is it impossible for you to imagine that i read all of it and i still disagree with your assessment of the events? Youre brainwashed. Go back to school and learn critical reading skills. 90% of the stuff in the emails was politics as usual that trumpets twisted and turned in such a way to work themselves into a lather. Do you really believe in spirit cokking and pizzagate? Bc i honestly worry for peoples mental health who do believe in that stuff. It is russian propoganda man, please read something other than far rightwing bullshit with 0 sources. That site HAS NO AUTHOR, NO SOURCES IT CITES OTHER THAN HAVKED INFORMATION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN FULLY VETTED, AND INFORMATION THAT THEY DO HAVE IS ONLY INTERPRETED IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. Do you understand that there are OTHER WAYS TO INTERPRET THAT INFORMATION OTHER THAN THINKING THAT DEMOCRATS ARE SATANIST CHILD MOLESTORS?  Seriously do you? You might need help if the only thing you see when you see liberals is pure evil. Its stupid.
Lol k. Link to proof. And then proof that donnys weongdoing plus incompetence isnt worse. Have fun!
This is adorable.
They arent terror attacks bc they are white and he says so. 
Yeah ive speant 10 dollars (on the expansion thingy) and ive been playing for about two weeks. Im already working on my 2nd tier 1 deck and i have a solid tier 2 deck as well.
Lol. Ok, so read with critical thought? Like, are they supposed to be perfect? If so, maybe don't link to a subreddit that believes in fucking pizzagate , bc that kind of defeats your "we can only trust and gain knowledge from  sources that are always correct and never have any reporters that make human mistakes." You know there is a middle ground, right? What's your standard? 100% accurate 100% of the time? Where do you draw the line? 
Go fuck yourself you worthless piece of cowardly trash.
I didnt realize the mostdamagingwikileaks was an fbi related website. Wtf are you talking about? 
And you have to be white.
Eternal. Cards are easier to get, and the meta has a lot of viable decks currently.
The website also propogates pizzagate. So yeah liberals are the one who have lost it. Wait...we didnt vote in the thin skinned egomanic con artist rapist who cant handle a twitter account with ties to russia...why would we be the ones who lost it again? Oh right for not believing russian propoganda about a child pedophilia ring and spirit cooking. Go to college and learn something real before mind rots away from all this garbage.
Better question. Why would he not? ;)
K, weenie
I read a study about the *locations* of DMVs in dalls as well. It was few years ago but it was right when voter id laws became a big thing. Richest, whiteest quadrent of DFW had 4 or 5 dmvs with the most open hours, the least rich and least white quadrent had 0 dmvs. Each bus ride to the dmv from that quadrent was over an hour long, and only ran 8-5 m-f. The second poorest least white quadrent had 1 dmv located nearest to the richest whitest quadrent (not centrally located) and was opne an average of something like 10 days a month, many of the days were half days. Ill try to find and link it later, but im sure its easily googled. It was from 2012 and was specifically about dallas and houstons dmv availability for the poor and minorities. 
Are you telling me that organization disfunction on certain stories at certain times means that every story ever written by the organization must now be discarded? Guess I cant trust any news source, or expert ever. Yay, anti-intellectualism!
...and you die.
Amazing spiderman 2 made money. As did apocolype. But neither made as much as they wanted it to for the investment. Apoclypse cost 3.3x as much as deadpool and made 200 million less. Who knows what theyre up for? 
In the game you can make giant killer robots, water purification systems, telepprters, armored mechs, houses, start a town, automated defenses, and more, but a tire is too much for you?
Do your research man. You sound like you work for infowars. If 1000 policy studies tells us it supresses vote, then it does. It doesnt matter after that what the reasons of indivduals are not being able to vote. Youre basically saying damn poor peoples right to vote bc i dont like them, how very american...
That someone being Chinese-American doesn't necessarily mean that their ancestors worked on the American railway system during the 1800's. 
Have you ever killed is actually one of the questions they ask when they start their quest for info on you. Its weird but ive heard ex-scientologists say they ask stuff like that and whethwr or not youre gay so they can hold it over yoir head if you try to leave.
Lol people who act like the two party system is the problem make me laugh. 0 of these problems in multi party systems, right? Brazil and france have no political issues, right? No benefits to a two party system, right? 
Yes. Your annoyance at people waiting until that last minute to register to vote is sufficient reason to not have them vote. Damn democracy!
He, most likely, choose that plan out of many. Knowing military planning they probably had hundreds of different plans. They may have even advised *against* this plan, but they drew it uo anyways bc they make as many plans as possible. The US military has plans if Canada invades us, or if an aquifer is poisoned, they probably have plans to onvade half the countries in the world. 
Nobody said it was...
Reeee I'm /u/kelsoATX only libruls lie!!!
Replaying shadows of mordor bc i nevee played the dlc and im excited  for shadows of war!
Yeah no idea what this guy is talking about, sure, I played non-casual magic, but that was only on fridays and maybe weekends with a tournament. Monday was pauper, tuesday modern, wednesday and thirsday were draft and commander, saturday was free play, sunday was commander again but with prizes. I think 70% of magic players are casual. Just a guess based of my experience.\n\nEdit: ive never heard meta bitching like i have in hearthstone, even at the height of bad magic metas. Mostly bc shops had the ability to ban cards themselves if it got no fun for the casuals. So in that way (house rules) magic catered even more to casuals.
This is just a link to a imgur post. Where is the original source? I couldnt find it on their website.  http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx
Hmmm still wont bring me back from eternal, but a move in the right direction. And im looking for a reason to come back. 
Those are all easily googled.  Get your fingers out of your ears, and your head out of DTs ass. Coward
Wow a trump supporter recounting the ruso-gerogian war from the perspective of russians. Funny that. Fuck your russian apologetics. I know what happened there. 
I wouldnt walk on that in a video game, let alone real life. 
I don't want it too....but, I mean, it *can*. Like, it has happened a whole bunch.
Fuck zerohedge. 
It's conservatives projecting again. They latch onto the like 3 liberal billionaires that are open about it. But they have the kochs who did actually help fund early tea party efforts, and adelson who does do shit like this. Not to mention trump who did pay people to attent his rally and his announcement. Just like they project when they talk about the left being against free speech, or hating american values.
90s comics writer "how about a clone of our big gun op guy but we give a blade helmet and blade everything else as well" 90s comic editor "you had me at clone."
Hahaha ok. Ill read your russian propoganda later. Have fun selling out your country for false narrative sold to you by people who hate you!
Yes and it should come from the president right? Thats his job right? Nope thats *our* job and its autocratic if the president does it. Do you not get that, are you so willfully blind? 
In my experience i play as a shitty aggro deck against feln. Maybe im playing the matchup wrong. But feln has easily beat either of my armory deck the last two time i played.

I mean its up to you really, but how long will it take finding someone you love again? Ive been single for almost a year and i have no desire for sex bc i cant find someone like what you have. 
Fine. Trump defender? Seem to be awfully sure of hillarys guilt and trumps innocence.
Lol ive been on a lotr kick recently rewatched the movies, reread the books, and i literally redownloaded the first game last night. I also googled for the second game last night, as knew they had talked about it 6-8omths after the first came out. There was nothing about the second one i could find beyond ign reports from about a year ago. This is fucking awesome, anything like the first and ill day one it. Basically batman arkham coty but lotr.  
Found my full bibliography. Still looking for paper. I got a b minus for editing so dont expect too much. \n
Ehhh I'm a sales person and I'm your friend lol. I think it depends on what they are selling and who they are as a person. I sell isp/cable so i guess 75% is just giving people what they want and 25% is just giving them info so they know what they want. Sales can be easy and a rewarding job if youre not looking for your next mark (people sense that shit, most of the time) and instead look for people who already want what youre selling. Just my 2 cents.
Who knows, he might be right. It would be nice if he wasn't so damn *happy* about it. When arts and humanities are gone, leaving only vocational courses and stuff specifically linked to pumping out industry workers, the loss to civilization will be great.

It's okay, he has 4WD
But why the fuck are we even talking about Obama? Fuck your false moral equivalency bullshit. Trump tweets that negative polls are fake. At rallies he had people chanting attacks at reporters standing right fucking there. He kicked out 5 major international news organizations TODAY  bc he didnt like there reporting. In his press confidence he called cnn and bbc fake news to their faces. He has said that the problem isnt that his National security advisor broke the law in talking to russia, but that the press found out about it. He said it wasnt a problem when priebus broke the law in asking the fbi to step in on an ongoing investigation but rather that people found out about it.This isnt fucking normal, and obama had a literal fuckton of negative press on him wall street journal, one america news network, breitbart, fox. Stop with your paritsan hack bullshit and wake up or own up to the fact that you only care about free speech when its altright douchebags who cant get speaking fees at universities bc the people who indirectly pay for it dont fucking like them. 
The thing his they probably have 100s of contiguous plans. So, sure they brought the plan before him, but it was probably was one of many plans, including the plan "lets not do this".

Maybe it was cheaper to go after the ringleaders and let that be an example to the rest of them. Not sure it would work as a strategy, though; I'm almost certain their buddies and everyone in that extended network learned the wrong lesson from this incident.
It's amazing when I watch these videos how *different* the game works for others. Just in this short clip I noticed how quickly the silhouette showed up when he went into listen mode, where mine takes a second or more to show up. Also how quickly the opponent was dodging from side to side is *definitely* way better than what the game will do on my end. My avatar has to slow down before it can make a 180º turn. Weaving side to side simply doesn't work, at least not at the speeds I see people doing it on YouTube. Is it a console/PC difference (I'm on PS3), or perhaps a connection speed thing?

We'll be paying double for it when the cost of produce skyrockets because there are no longer people who're willing to harvest it for way less than minimum wage. When everything at the grocery store doubles in price, that wall won't look so good anymore.

Sending out queries on my 2nd novel, *Sun Dogs* (first was self-pubbed but I'd rather go traditional this time). Set in 1977, it is the story of ex-con Joe Costa who, with the help of his two friends, becomes a modern-day pirate raiding luxury yachts in the Florida Keys. \n\nAlso in the process of editing a Polynesian fantasy novel, *Islands of Fire*, with hopes of getting it published.\n\nSent out some short stories as well, but then I was hit with grading for my three college Composition courses, so that'll have to wait until next week.\n\nEDIT: [My first novel](https://www.amazon.com/Chant-Love-Lamentation-Brian-Reeves-ebook/dp/B006IML7ME/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486682291&sr=8-1&keywords=a+chant+of+love+and+lamentation) because why not
I'm with you on the cosm cards. Already I'm wondering if I'll just mix them in with the others, then have a rule that they can be played (if in cosm), traded (if someone in the party is from that cosm), or "cashed in" for a +d6 on a single roll. It remains to be seen. You're right, I'll need to try it out in play first, but it already seems cumbersome.\n\nThe ones from original Torg were interesting but *never* ended up being used, not once, and that was a decade-long part-time campaign. I used to let people cash them in as a possibility; now I see that was too powerful. Probably should have just taken them out.
They won't -_-

Again, looks like great changes here.\n\nI always had a hard time running Nippon Tech adventures. Eventually I just made it into a full-on cyberpunk setting, and that seemed to help, but I've never been that great at intrigue. The whole "run a corporation" mini-game from original Torg was a creative idea, but miles ahead of what I could handle at that age. Hell, I couldn't have told you what a corporation *was* back then, much less how stocks work, etc.

I've wondered this same thing many times. My used copy of East of Eden had a receipt tucked in it, about 3/4ths of the way through, from where it was purchased at an airport bookstore in San José. Surely the local connection had something to do with the purchase. I couldn't help but wonder if that person read the book during their plane trip, if they ever finished it, what they thought of it, and why they ended up selling it.

The only non-fan modern setting that I know of is [Streets of Bedlam](http://www.streetsofbedlam.com/). I don't think it does martial arts though.\n\nThere are probably a lot of fan offerings that could be combined with it to give you what you want. There are a couple of different takes on Wuxia Kung Fu out there (including [one I wrote](http://getsavaged.blogspot.com/2007/12/savage-wuxia.html) that uses Edges, though nowadays I wonder if the Adept Edge and appropriately-flavored Powers might do the trick). There's also *Mustache Force*, which is pretty fucking amazing. The author is updating his settings so it currently isn't available but you might be able to find it through the magic of Google.
Thanks for the reply. 
It's like living in a parallel universe. I keep hoping some "Man in the High Castle"-like films will start turning up that show our country under sane, rational leadership.

Not sure, to be honest. They could be a couple of decades or a couple of years. Since none of them were painted, the harsh tropical weather was particularly hard on them. Honestly, I'd never been in buildings like those -- made of nothing but planks, with gaps wide enough to see in/out in all directions, except up of course (zinc roof). Rickety as heck, and nothing but naked wood in all directions. I went in one I was considering for my domicile; it was painted turquoise inside... on *every surface*. \n\nBy the way, this was Charles Place, probably the poorest street in the main New Amsterdam area. My homestay was in a house down this lane. There were larger slums across the backdam, but the density of this street really magnified the look of the clapboard houses.
I was a kid then so my memory isn't totally clear, but I think I had a hardbound book of his artwork depicting destroyed spacecraft. Some were floating hulks deep in space, others crashed on planets. One picture had the skeletal body of a dead astronaut in a space suit with a shattered helmet. That was an amazing book.

I don't think they're scared of him, they're just trying to get as much out of him as they can before the whole thing comes crashing down. They know it's only a matter of time. When the time is right they'll turn on him and pretend to be just as shocked and dismayed as the rest of us.

I have Sinclair Lewis' *It Can't Happen Here* queued up after *1984*. \n\n>Published during the rise of fascism in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Berzelius "Buzz" Windrip, a politician who defeats Franklin Delano Roosevelt and is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and "traditional" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a plutocratic/totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of Adolf Hitler and the SS. The novel's plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup's opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here

I'm usually of the opinion that query letters should be direct and clear. Rather than diving in to a plot point, start off with some quick info: why you're writing, the book's title, its page length, and why you chose that agent. "I'm seeking representation for my young adult fantasy novel, *Warrior's Gambit*, which is complete at 90,000 words. I am a fan of the works of your client, Connie Butler, and feel we place a similar emphasis on the role of strong females in the fantasy genre."\n\nThen get into a short and punchy summary of your plot. Keep it succinct -- no more than 100 - 200 words, sticking to the most vital plot points and emphasizing how the choices of the main character drive the plot. Gotta take a broad view, here. Imagine you are writing the text that will appear on the back of the book -- too much detail will ruin it, but not enough is bland and vague. Don't say how the story ends; at around the 3/4ths point you'll want to leave the synopsis on a cliffhanger. \n\nWrap up by telling the agent a little about yourself. Again, brief is key. They don't need your autobiography. Stick to relevant information. Where you live, where you went to college or what you do (as long as that might lend to your credibility), and your previous publications if any. Don't tell them you've been writing since you were 5 years old -- so has everyone else. Finish by offering to send a chapter and full synopsis, and by thanking the agent for their attention.\n\nBoom, done.

Our group had one (out of 20) full-on Republican-style conservative. A couple more could be described as somewhere in the center or hovering just to the right of it. The rest of us were liberal to different degrees. I was probably the most far-left person there.\n\nIn any group you're likely to have a spread. That said, I think the whole concept of Peace Corps has a leftist bent, and is more likely to appeal to progressives. However, you most likely won't be ostracized or treated poorly just based on your conservative politics.
The game Torg (which partially inspired Savage Worlds) used to distinguish between "Standard" scenes and "Dramatic" scenes. During a Standard scene, conflicts are quick and pretty easy to resolve. But during a Dramatic scene, complications keep arising, setbacks come up, and the stakes are way higher. \n\nYou could borrow this for Savage Worlds, using a similar distinction in your game. During a Standard scene, Extras rolls can't explode more than one time. During a Dramatic scene, revert to the regular rules. (By definition, if a Wild Card enemy is part of the combat, it is a Dramatic scene.)

The jobs Trump offered were a combination of lies and racism.

Other places may have a lot, but I probably saw a dozen today...We could pay for the rail with red light tickets.
Gluten is protein, when you work the dough then let it rest it cross links, making the dough tougher, which makes for chewier noodles. Egg yolk is generally an emulsifier...not so sure on the whites other than that they are another protein in the mix so they probably add some cross linking.
Key to getting credit for your running is to keep going in as straight a line as possible. Pogo increments your distance every 4 minutes, in a straight line from the point you were at. So the fewer turns you have on your route, the more accurate the credit you'll get for it.\n\nIdeal is to watch your buddy and only change direction after it increments its distance. I go out for a quick walk past some spawn points near my house, and walk until I get the second increment, then turn around and walk back.
It was this "both sides are the same" rhetoric that put Trump in office, by persuading a crucial few that they shouldn't bother to vote. When you spread it, you're a tool of fascism, even if you think you're antifascist.\n\nHillary's worst crime was being bland. She's always been at the center of the Overton Window, and didn't offer much hope of moving it...but now it's being slammed into nightmare territory because of people who weren't satisfied with good enough.

Once, some really, really stupid people said a well-educated, intelligent man was going to ruin the country, therefore I see no reason to worry about a self-centered idiot in the most powerful position in the world.
Aw, you made them cry.
Follow the money. I believe Trump's election was a conspiracy by the comedians, who looked at Hillary and said "It's going to be a dry four years."
Well, I'm hardly a Clinton loyalist, she's well to the right of me. I just have a problem with people who suck down the Big Lies that have been used against the Clintons for the past 25+ years. Don't try to blame anyone else for what you did to this country by persuading Millenials not to vote.\n\nClinton lost by hair-thin margins in every state. White middle class kids aren't the ones who are suffering because of what you did.\n\nThe Republicans are the party of someone else's personal responsibility. Why don't you go join them, you'll fit right in.
"Sanders supporters" who somehow thought they shouldn't listen to him.
So your attitude is "I'm OK right now, fuck everybody else and fuck the future." Yup, Trump supporter.
Thanks, that was pretty sweet!

Sorry, pal, "both sides do it" is not just the weakest possible defense, it's a lie. But truth hasn't been a concern for your party for decades now, has it? You claim to be patriots while waving a traitors' flag, and idolize a President who conspired with Iran, our self-declared  enemies, to keep hostages imprisoned in order to improve his electoral odds. If there was justice in this world, every one of you would get blood poisoning from your hypocritical American flag lapel pins.
I was a Sanders supporter and unenthusiastic about Hillary because she is just too wedded to the center, and I know a lot of other Sanders supporters, including the local campaign manager...but I don't know a single one who refused to vote for Hillary or talked shit about her.\n\nI also know a few "both sides are the same" folks, but they're advocates of revolution, not voting.\n\nSo yeah, there might be a *little* bit of organic Bernie broism, but I suspect it's really really small.
There are mods on  multiple subs who will blanket ban anyone who raises their ire.

No one is good enough for you. You must be an avatar of virtue if you can live up to your own standards.\n\nIf you go to polifact and compare Trump to Clinton, his truth rating of 4% is lower than her pants on fire rating of 7%...so really, *no difference at all*. 70% of his statements were false...but we're judging him unfairly, according to you.\n\nAre you a troll, or are you completely stupid?
If your area is dominated by another team, you're in a better position, since there's always a gym to take down. There was an area in my town that was solid Instinct, if you were Instinct you just had to move on down the line if you wanted to fight. Not as bad now that it's easier to knock down gyms.
They made it a lot easier to knock down gyms, which was a good fix. But you are complaining that you get knocked down, when the fact is that you are surrounded by opportunity, and you have no sympathy for those who don't have that opportunity. If you aren't buff enough to take out a 10 or two a day, find some fellow Instincts to gang up with.
I couldn't make it the half mile to work in the morning if I did that. Just the red light runners would put me in Steve Bannon territory. 
When Trump was out on the campaign trail, he passed a kid with a box of kittens. He stopped the limo to get a photo op, and asked the kid what party the kittens belonged to.\n\n"Oh, they're Republicans, of course!" the boy said.\n\nA couple of weeks later, Trump was going through the same neighborhood and saw the boy with the kittens. "Watch this!" he said to thr entourage. He went up to the kid and asked "What party are your kittens?" \n\nThe little boy said "They're Democrats." \n\nTrump said "What?!? Last week they were Republicans!"\n\nThe little boy said "Their eyes are open now."

Might be good of them to figure out a mission that worked for rural players...maybe "fight gym then visit all stops in x radius" so people in low-density areas would get compensation.
Funny how that crap candidate had the highest popular vote lead of any "losing" candidate. 
Actually,  it was designed to give more power to slave states, because otherwise they wouldn't have signed on. So Trump is ultimately part of the legacy of slavery.\n\nWhy the fuck should rural people rule the country? They have no special moral or intellectual superiority, as they just proved by putting one of the biggest assholes in the country into possession of nuclear weapons.\n\nFunny that you refer to the more popular candidate as the crap one.

Why would anyone bother to read another word when this is their lead item? Just as much blatant racism throughout the rest of it, claiming that since Hillary isn't a disgusting racist like them she's a liar.\n\nDid you read that shit, or did you just pull the URL?

They are still in favor of any regulation that raises the price of guns.
My views didn't make them vote for an asshole. Their views did that.\n\nYou need to read some history. The EC vote allocation and the 3/5ths rule were put in for the same reason. Those small states were the slave states,  and the overpowering they were afraid of was having their slaves freed.\n\nGiving rural people more votes isn't democracy, it's boobocracy. We're suffering under it right now. Most of those states have deliberate voter suppression laws, put in place by people they voted for. \n\nSome people want to play nice and make excuses for Trump voters, but the bottom line is that they were, at best, stupid, and if they voted for him because they thought they were held in contempt by urban people, then that is just proof that they are contemptibly stupid.
I'm saying your grip on reality is about as tight as Kaczynski's.
Just keep saying the same thing over and over. EC and 3/5ths rule were in the same document, and were there for the same reason. You're pretending the Constitution was written today, but it was written in the 18th century, and getting the slave states to join the union was a very big issue.\n\nThe idea that Clinton didn't offer working class people anything is bullshit. Minimum wage boost, protection of ACA, protection from predatory banking...\n\nIt's especially bullshit when you try to say that Trump offered them more. He talked about jobs, but his ideas for creating them were plain stupid, and if you say they persuaded rural people, you're just saying that rural people are stupid.\n\nAnd claiming Trump won because Clinton is disingenuous??? The champion liar in the country won because Clinton was "disingenuous?"  Once again you're saying Trump voters are stupid.\n\nYou haven't really examined your arguments, have you?
Clinton isn't even evil. She's just bland. The idea that she is the lesser evil is fallout from 25 years of a Big Lie industry. \n\nAny of the other Republican candidates would have been the lesser evil.

Well, if they just cut a multi million "salary" by the taxes they now have to pay more as a corporation and give only the "rest" to the manager, the latter gets a bit less but it could still be millions.
My wife is the defacto system admin at her office because there are only five employees.  So the office manager comes to her complaining that projects she was working on were disappearing. After some excruciating investigation (the manager's favorite phrase is "I don't know" which means "don't try to make me do that"),  my wife discovered that the manager was keeping current projects in the recycle bin,  and only transferring them to a folder when she was completely done. So anything that had to be updated monthly was in the recycle bin, and when it got overfull they were being auto deleted.\n\nMy wife checked around the office,  and one of the attorneys, a 20-something recent JD, was doing the same thing. So she sent out an email to everyone explaining why this was a very bad idea...the response was "you don't have any authority to tell me how to use my computer."

Yes, that's their "names" within the registry. And it's split into various files on two locations. User Profile (ntuser.dat) and c:\\windows\\system32\\config.

In my 50ies I have no problem admitting that I left spiritual fantasies of a non-material part of the universe just about 15 years ago.

As the headline says, good journalism seems to have a revival, though I'm hesitant to tell if it's still pregnancy or birth already happened.

To admire leaders and delegate responsibility to them is a human social weakness, not a strength. As stupid as inventing an omnipotent god in heaven is to create authoritarian social organizations on earth. It's not the leader really being the stupid but the leadership as such is an impossible task for a human for various reasons. Those with the urge to lead are never the most intelligent and cultivated but usually tend to be just smart enough to be successful with gambling the power game.

I didn't know bathrooms had gender and were sentient enough to transition
at least she's a female
[2 seconds of googling.](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/160/) the name of both this strip and the web comic are on the image.
I knew from episode one that would happen and dropped it right then because I wasn't ready for an emotional rollercoaster like that
a set can contain only one element. whether or not you are your own friend is up to you though
did moe shop make more cassettes??
let's be real, I'm not attractive.\n\nat all.
I don't actually want to. I mean I guess it sounds nice in theory but that's it. my anxiety stopped me last time so I gave up

I want to be kumiko really badly :/
I am shit so I'd be right at home
how do you people manage watching this anime\n\nI'm serious because the first episode made me want to kill myself really badly
GJ-bu is the anime
I saw that a draft was circulating but couldn't view the article because the page would just change to a "Facebook giving away money" scam ad thing
I've seen some on eBay before.
I don't think I could deal with not visiting this sub for a week
it seems to me that there's no reason for id to be on top as long as you're using a JSON lib because you can get elements by their name
except the part where you fuck anyone ever, that part doesn't happen
I, without hyperbole, think about ending my life for most of my day and am unable to stomach this anime
lol no
almost?
{Love Pentagon: The Anime}
I can vouch as an animal that wears her swatch on her right hand that they're not really cheap but I got a really cute one and I do actually love it
I have a keyboard with MX switches but it has a non standard bottom row as well as a stepped caps lock so keysets are kinda hard to find and expensive when I do.\n\nmy main is an HHKB though, so I don't really need to worry about caps for that
not like I wasn't already going to hell
can we have something that's not on Facebook please? I don't have an account and do not plan on changing that anytime soon.
that's so cute and I love it. I'm jelly
no sorry I'm way too insecure about myself haha
I'm so happy for you! ^^^^and ^^^^so ^^^^sad ^^^^for ^^^^myself
actually, by default you are the ugly one.\n\nif your friend group consists of only yourself, there is only one person that can possibly be the ugly one, and it's you.\n\nnot like you weren't the ugly one already haha amirite
I dunno, it's just a meme to me
haha
why does this nigga have "love" tattooed on his forehead
too bad these movies suck
ayy did someone say *chronic*
you know I was having a nice time on this website until I saw this picture
not too long ago someone posted an anime personification of kotlin 
honestly Naruto doesn't interest me. the whole "action" genre is pretty unappealing imo
"that's *our* word"
ur not wrong
I mean I do too but like this anime makes me very sad and angry
you're fired
it's just softcore porn though. actual porn doesn't make me feel sad and angry about being a virgin loser
sorry for having an opinion
this show pisses me off to no end. only watched one episode and I knew I'd kill myself if I continued
1. I usually buy tape that's already cut to the length I need or use some C90 or C60 tapes I have around.\n\n2. yes, there are templates. but, jcards are 4"x4.0625", with folds at 1" and 1.5" from the left.\n\n3. not sure about this one outside of having it done professionally, sorry. though I would like to know the answer myself
text is "たのしかったね" which basically means "that was fun"
hke just links to archive.org mp3 mirrors of dream albums and called it a day. quite a joke of a "mirror site" if you ask me
instead of obj.put(), it's array.add(), and like I said there's no key, so your data will be basically illegible. then you have to put the array into the object and write it.
he didn't say that, he said he would cooperate with extradition by the USA, but we haven't tried to extradite him yet
not very often that I see good bright rices. nice
are either of those two really you irl
as much as I don't want it to be, this is basically how I feel.\n\nthe "motivation" like OP is rather upsetting to me. I don't want to be a girl with a penis, I just want to be a girl. to me this image just reminded me that I'm worse than other girls because of my genitals. there is no nice way for you to put it, if you remind me of my dong I'm not going to like it.\n\nnot to mention I hate motivational/uplifting/wholesome memes.
then you probably already thought that you're ugly

My proposal is very simple and depends on a simple concept in geometry.\n\nThe majority leader appoints a committee that draws the boundaries of sub-districts one third the population of a whole district. All such sub-districts are required to be convex (state lines and coastlines do not affect convexity).\n\nThen the minority leader appoints a committee to construct contiguous whole districts from the sub-districts.\n\nThis simple solution is based on the same principle that is used to cut a piece of cake fairly.
Shit, ya... God save us!
You could combine this with a small orchard as well and the chickens now have an extra food source from the fallen fruit.  Also plant a bunch of kale plants and in addition to the kale, the aphids it will attract are a tasty snack for the birds.
I use peanut butter all the time, I also add in sesame oil to smooth out the flavor to be closer to a "traditional" hummus.\n\nI've also made avocado hummus before as well and it was uber tasty.
mobile chicken tractors.  \n\nIt's kind of like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxc0wgbh_As  Although I'd personally stagger the tractors and have one each week so you have a continual supply of birds to process on say an 8 week cycle.  \n\nHere's more detail from Joel Salatin:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfT49gaiktg
Airplane mode!  And the battery lasts quite a bit.\n\nEventually I'll get rid of all the pre-installed stuff, but most things have been removed.  I have a browser, music player, special audiobook reader, ebook reader, ssh client, map viewer, ColorNote, file manager, two games for my son to play at certain times, library app, and a flashlight.\n\nThere are no push applications running, no background syncing, no social media apps installed.  Shoot, 1/2 the time I don't even know where the phone is :)   I take the viewpoint that the phone is for my convenience and not for that of others.
brined overnite.\n\nEither grilled with salt and pepper, or baked right on the oven rack (with thyme and butter) over a pan of root veggies.
Looking forward to trying to catch a game against Stanford in a few weeks.  The Sunken Diamond is a pretty cool stadium; I've shot a couple of NCAA Regionals there in the past as well.
sounds like you could check out /r/churning.  some go overboard, but done right, it can really knock down on the travel expenses.
I live in California, and while flights aren't quite that much, still a pain in the ass.   At least you guys have the DPNZ/DPA.
I just discovered it this past summer; we were doing a more traditional tourist vacation staying in apartments/hotels and taking the train.  I ran across it in the town of Lucca in Tuscany.  I did see 4-5 travelers which looked like they were taking the trail; I didn't ask them, but they sure were long distance backpakers.\n\nIf you go, give us a writeup!
We flew from London to Rome for $25 each this summer on Ryan Air.  And we  talked with some people from Romania and they said their flights were even cheaper.  I was just going based on what I paid and what others told me this past summer.
but it really looks like a photo of fabric with lines on it :)
493 is my best score, but it's been a while since I've played it; part of my 2017 is to practice more and I'll be re-adding this back into my routine.
try adding a little sesame oil as well.
> I want to retire early. I want to be 40 years old and choose to simply work part time because I want to do other things with my life other than spreadsheets. \n\nHA!  Welcome to tracking your FIRE :)    I'm a bit biased, I've been tracking/using spreadsheets for 35+ years, started with my baseball card collection.\n\nWhen first starting out, those early "big" paychecks compared to part time college jobs can seem like endless spools of money.  You're ahead of the curve compared to most people; I remember being 23 and quite overwhelmed with all of the financial choices out there; you should have seen my 401k allocations back in 1996, oh boy...I heard "diversify" so I was in like 15 funds.\n\nPersonally if I were to be starting over again, here's what I'd do (and there are a lot more options today than when I was getting started):\n\n1. Drive your car until it dies or is like 16 years old and falling apart.  Buy a 2-3 year old used car for 1/2 the price of a new one.\n1. I'd stash the maximum % I can into my 401k, Pick a target 2060 fund or something, leave things along for the first year.  Just get used to maxing out your 401k; there are other strategies out there that say, 401k min to match, HSA, IRA (or Roth if you make too much), the rest of the 401k, e-fund, brokerage, etc.  You might as well get used to maxing your 401k, to me the rest is sort of tickey tack micro adjustments to allocations; you want to "set it and forget it" as Ron Popeil says :)\n1. Figure out a basic budget and have that amount direct deposited into your checking account.\n1. Setup an online savings account, and adjust your direct-deposit and have like $500 going into it each paycheck.  Again, leave it alone for the first year of working.  Heck even turn off statement notifications if you must.\n1. The remainder of your paycheck can go into a 2nd savings account, I call this my 'working' savings account and then when the balance reaches a certain point, transfer to a brokerage account and load up on some post-tax investments, leaving a portion as a basic buffer.\n1. Load up on the HSA if your employer offers one; some even offer seed funding, I think mine is now $1,000 a year they put in.\n1. 2nd year of working, you can look into adjusting your 401k if the Target fund isn't as sexy as you'd like.\n1. 2nd year of working, you now have a very handy savings account; you can fund an IRA (go with a tIRA for the tax savings until you can't, then go with a Roth IRA) up until April 15th of the following year for the previous year (2017-04-15 I can fund my 2016 IRA).  Your call on when you fund your IRA, either at the beginning of the year or pushing all the way til April the following.  Sometimes it's better to wait, esp when all of this is new and you can't cover a sudden expense.
http://www.randalolson.com/2013/12/21/political-polarization-of-the-senate-is-the-data-fooling-us/\n\nAnd the full series of images from the article: http://imgur.com/a/Wmoex#0\n\nThe "Divisiveness" line chart in the main article I find interesting; I think I might need to do some more analysis on that; it seems as though there are a few additional patterns there.
I thought that looked familiar; I played a File World Golf Tour event there back in 2000.  I fared much better that weekend winning the event at South Mountain the following day.
5 acres is 466 ft^2 (142 m^2); it's kinda small
It's Yosemite, you're in the heart of the Sierras; there are a ton of trails, I think I read there is 800+ miles of trails in the park.  Both the PCT and JMT are also in Yosemite.   There should be plenty of trips to make, esp if you can get out of the valley for the start/end of a few.  Plus you'll be an expert with a bear canister by the end of the summer :)
We started an UTMA brokerage account when our child was 7.  Took his savings money and bought him some dividend paying stocks.  Once his savings builds up, through recycling, savings, gifts, etc, we transfer and buy a new company.   He's making $400+ a year in dividends right now.  \n\nThe one drawback is that it's considered an asset for the minor when it comes to financial aid.
Also Chris White from California.
It does seem to have a bit of a Libertarian skew, but I've found my results to be fairly accurate; but then again, I just have a degree in History and not political science
on 5 acres?  5 acres is NOT a lot of land; it's 466^2 ft (142^2 m)\n\nedit: notation fixes.
ranges from 30-90 PPR on there. 
"hey man, can you cover my 3-7am shift at the bar?"  yea, lots of people will be stepping up for that one :/\n\nI do agree with you though; I'm just thinking of how this would impact the people who actually work there vs. the owners
thrift stores are your friends for toys/clothes.  I outfitted my 4th grader for the year for $45.  K-2nd grade we were going through pants every 2-3 months from the knee blowouts, good thing the pants were $2-5 
meditation has been helpful
Depends on the state; look into "cottage laws" which tend to cover these things.  They will tell you what is and is not allowed under them and where/when you would need things to be prepared in a commercial kitchen along with labeling requirements.
Yes.  There are many different interpretations of how things might be organized, but I've enjoyed the concepts presented from www.politicalcompass.org 
what's the over/under on the number of 400+ yd drives?
We eat local forest raised pork, so there's not much more flavor that needs to be added to it; we like to try to let the product shine on it's own :)
The theory is to replace shoes after 500 miles.  Most of that is probably race registrations; then tend to be $50+ each\n\nI don't run, but hike; I did get 1,500 miles out of my last pair.
You are correct, my mistake, the flights were not $25 each, they were $37 each.
Me thinks it's time to upgrade the TaylorMade Firesole with the Bubble shaft... \n\nalthough I'm still getting around 262yds with it, but only 42% fairways :/
I think OP might be more concerned that he didn't sign up for email digests about a tuna press; he just did a search for them and ended up getting the emails...\n\nBTW, not assuming gender of OP; English just doesn't have a neutral pronoun :/
The events I started were $50 and a guarantee of like 17 legs up to 69 if the winner went the distance in every leg.  All 501.\n\nFunny you mention double elimination; I'm looking to put together a weekend event with a RR->KO on one day and a double elim matchplay event the next day.  all steel tip, all 501; well, maybe a cricket draw event on saturday to mix things up :)
That is true; and yes, they are very good at the manipulation of getting people to vote against their own best interests.   \n\nProgressives need marketing/sales people, but not the shifty "used car salesman" model, or maybe that's what is needed?  Total turn off for me, but some people eat that stuff up I guess.
My son and I enjoyed reading [In the Beginning: Creation Stories from Around the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228030.In_the_Beginning)\n\nThis past year we've also read about Norse Myths/Gods, Buddhist Stories, One Hand Clapping (Zen stories), and Native American Legends.  Probably going to tackle Beowulf, African Myths, Chinese Myths, and Don't Know Much About Mythology
As others have mentioned, playing games online on pro-darter and WDA are good, as is playing against the computer using N01.  Back when I was practicing a lot I followed the practice routine here: http://bayareadarts.com/practice.html\n\nshoot well!
> 10 events over 5 weekends.\n\n$400+ round trip flight, 1 day off of work, $200+ entry fee, $200+ hotel fee, food/beverage/misc costs.  It's expensive for the players and the current payouts down the line can't compensate for the expenses for the majority of players.
Internal travel is much cheaper in Europe than in the US.  London to Rome is $25 on the discount airlines, $4 bus/train ride to town and you're good.\n\nI've never played an overseas event, but looking at some of the fliers, there are like 5-6 events a weekend vs. 11-14 at your typical weekend event in the US.  That might a couple of reasons.\n\nTo be honest, most events in the US haven't figured out how to attract the average player; the "thrill" of drawing a top playing in the first round is NOT something that brings people back, in my opinion
hey, with careful management your forest can be quite productive :)\n\nthe 'auto-title' didn't fill in the entire thing and with a sticky 'r' on the keyboard and bad proofreading...we end up with funny titles.
or rail or banks or telecom.
Have you thought of enrolling in a class at a local college/university?  Most require a fee each quarter/semester for health services; and when I was in college I had all sorts of things covered, from exams, to prescriptions, to EKGs, to X-Rays.\n\nYou can also look at moving to many of the other first world nations other than the US that have universal health coverage, plus a few "3rd" world ones as well.
That's my weekly intake; we went with a more Asian model for meat consumption.  2 chicken legs or thighs and can make 5+ meals.
UK == Oregon as a size comparison.\n\nGeography kills us here.  There have been a few of use who have tried to get some long format things going.
I ended up getting a Canon G16 as my travel/backpacking camera.  A touch overkill (and heavy) for most probably, but I enjoy all of the same controls I would get from my DSLRs, including a viewfinder to use as opposed to just the LCD screen.
you only need 1 hour a semester; take a PE class, plus you get gym access :)
Is it just me or is it getting easier and easier to predict which party is introducing which bills based on the titles...
Speaking from personal experience, I changed High Schools during the middle of my Junior year and the start time at the new/2nd HS was 8:50 compared to 7:30 in my previous one and, while this is not overly scientific, I went from being in the top 45% to the top 20% by graduation.\n\nI seemed more alert further along in the day; granted this was nearly 30 years ago, but I can attest that starting later helped me out.
United has 'super saver' rates at certain dates/times for right around the same price.  I've used it for trips to London and Rome in the past few years. 
inter-europe flights are like $25 each.  that might make it a touch easier to get to the events.
We lived on 5 acres many decades ago, and yea, 5 acres is NOT what people think it is.  I think we had like 30+ well established pecan trees on it plus the house\n\nI remember when I was like 9-11 or so my parents bought a 1 acre lot for a future house and in addition to the house I was dreaming of an ATV track, my sister saw a horse riding/training facility and huge barn.  1 acre is tiny when it comes to "land".
yea, but has lived here since 1999
he has built a lot of houses
I don't use mobile and it still doesn't display correctly...
466 feet per side for a square.  my notation was wrong, I guess it would be 466^2 ft, sorry.
€200 is still considerably less than the $400-500 average RT here in the US
In the park, I believe they are if you're doing backcountry trips; if you're staying in one of the campgrounds, they are not.
There is also a PBS channel available for Plex; might want to give that a try if you have Plex as well.  It's not a good as s CBS Plex channel, which is awesome, but pretty decent.
I'm not either; HASI has been peeking my interest lately
REI garage sales are pretty handy.  $240 and I walked away with a quarterdome 2, marmot bastione jacket, and an REI flash 40 pack
No, but it's easier for people to visualize.  The 5 acres I lived on wasn't a square either, but it was rectanglish at around 400ft by 544ft.\n\nNo reason to do complex geometry as a visualization exercise.
Or a PR campaign by the Greens using the bible to show the similarities.  Quotes tend to go a long way with a lot of people, but quotes from the bible to the evangelicals who voted in Trump, even after a while they can't dispute them.\n\nIt's been a few decades since I've read the bible; I'd have to do some digging to locate some good ones.
that's the camera we bought for my son
Are you looking to travel along the [Via Francigena](http://www.viefrancigene.org/en/)?
Hmm...free checked bag via the AA credit card, and a new "cheap" seat option; if played right, this might work out for some people.
shit jobs can be ok if you're not having to scrape by on the wages it's providing you.  I'm thinking of the 30 year olds out there with a 15-20 year old car making minimum wage...
oh damn!  we were just talking about her this weekend at the camellia classic.  I knew she was fighting, I want to say cancer, didn't realize things were that advanced.

Depends on how you calculate them.  And Checkouts have a HUGE impact; I'm actually in the process of analyzing some different numbers from the 2300+ matches I have recorded from my singles league, local tournaments, and some TV events to better understand the impact of checkouts on averages.  Once I get my research finished I'll most likely be writing an article for a local league, and I'll post the info here as well.\n\nAnd of course, this graphic has been posted many times in this sub, but it always is well received :  http://bayareadarts.com/division_chart.jpg
shoot, nowadays my backpack is all I'm taking with me; granted it's a 40L one :)
man, my legs would be burning if I did 100 squats
much nicer playing conditions than in late August, when I played there after my friend graduated in the summer (15 years ago).  I think it was 108* by the time we walked off the course at 10am
but the concentration of lobbyists are in DC...if they're removed from the equation how will anything ever get done?  /s
I understand that, but being forced to work the graveyard shift at a bar??  That might not fly too well with the workers; that's where I was headed with my previous comment.
sounds like a good nite "out"
that's why the batsman wear leg padding :)
Virgin has been pretty cool
I don't know the specifics, but the big players have bought up most of the stations and tend to only broadcast a particular slant of shows.  Air America tried to get things going like 13 years ago, but then faded out
don't forget to toss a little /r/BuyItForLife  and /r/simpleliving in there as well
well, your average ends up being based on the matches you play.  In the Lobby, the average is usually listed next to the players name and availability status (at least the last time I was there; I have heard there have been some changes to the Lobby recently).\n\nPlay a few games and you'll end up with an average.
I've found the custom molded ones from Radiens have worked out quite well so far.  Each package is enough for me to make two sets.\n\nhttp://radians.com/radsite/index.php/industrial/industrial-safety-products/hearing-protection/item/radians-custom-molded-earplugs?category_id=8
I meant to type 466^2 ft.  466 feet per side for a square. sorry
tough to drown out the loud talk radio voices
I'm on WDA (although haven't played in a while...), and DPL before that, and the forum at double18.com before that were the creators of DPL came from, I was the 8th player registered on DPL.  And living where I live, I played MANY a league match at 6am and 11pm; both times I am not normally awake :o  It was a major influence on not just my singles league, but also the series of MLD events that I created.\n\nThere are several groups trying to get things going like you mention.  I love the inter-city Ohio event, I've followed the results.\n\nI'd love to see more events like the Carolina Open, which was heavily modeled/influenced by MLD; playing a shitton of darts over the course of a weekend can only make people better and I encourage more people to step up to offer such events.\n\nThanks BTW regarding my singles league; the thing that I like most is that each match, regardless of skill level (30-70 PPR) takes about 1 hour each.  It also provides a progression path upwards for those that wish to pursue that.  I've also have many players that just liked the fact that they were playing 12-20 legs a nite vs. 3-5 for most team leagues; they enjoyed the minor success, but weren't looking at competing at national level events; mostly because those events tend to not be setup for anyone but the top players by and large.\n\nWebcam darts might be in a bit of a pickle as I heard that Google Hangouts is being shutdown in a few months :(   Originally on DPL we were using well DartPro to connect for scoring, and Yahoo video call for the webcam to show the dartboard and to chat.  I think N01 has a new network a connection option, but I haven't played with it yet.
Yea, and the square root of that is 466; so 466ft x 466ft.  I was going to give the size in a dimensional slant.
/r/PacificCrestTrail as well
there's a local course near me where I've hit pretty much everything between a 7i and a 3w depending on the wind on a par 3 over water.
freeze-dried blueberries as well!
My 9 year old is making $400 a year in dividends right now.  The funding of his brokerage account comes from a 2x match his mom and I do for every $1 that is "saved".  So gift money, and income from recycling can go a long way for kids.\n\nI see this more as a 'basic income' to smooth out the bumps and bruises that are sure to happen in life.

Thrift stores, farmer's markets, libraries
Yea, I found it a bit weird that the cores were not coming out; but the little hands mashing the soil is kinda neat to watch :)
69 clicks?  I hate you sfgate...
reminds me of some sinister spider creation someone made.
When I had debt like 20 years ago, I still put in, at a minimum, the % into my 401k to get the free corporate matching.  Then worked to pay off the debt using a step down method with minimum payments to everything except the highest interest rate, then when that was gone, move onto the next one rolling the minimum with what I was paying on the first debt.
> unironic endorsement of the political compass and a passionate defense of its integrity.\n\nUmm...pretty sure that's not what I wrote.  I said that some of the concepts there are decent as a viewpoint for something different than the left-right argument.  I never said it's 100% accurate, nor that it's the only way of looking at things.  if anything one could use it as a jumping point in an attempt to reconcile the various viewpoints and opinions out there.   It's also not all US based; granted it does tend to lump things from a political label viewpoint, but one can just use that as another jumping point for further investigation into the nuances and variances of each.\n\nThe US elected Trump because of other reasons; and there's already a lot of buyer remorse happening and the inauguration hasn't even happened.  Maybe the Trump presidency will make people realize that they need to do a touch more investigation the next cycle and that whom you vote for actually matters.  Sometimes we have to go backwards to go forwards.
my problem is having the headphones on too long starts to give me headaches :/
The table posted here is a touch overwhelming, even for me and I created the damn thing.  I just really hate when people start banking on "ohh my gawd, look at horrible that player is with ONLY their 90 average".  They think the difference between a 50 and 60 average is the same as  from 90-100, but they are totally wrong.  50-60 is 5 darts where 90-100 is 1.5.  The linked chart shows the logarithmic nature of the math.\n\nBTW, if you ask any golfer what their index is, they will know what that means and generally how to apply it.  If you ask most softtippers what their rating is, they'll know what it means and how to apply it.  Steel tip darts has buried it's head in the sand for the past 20+ years, still trying to live in the heyday of the 80s.  Trying to introduce a new concept is always hard, I've battled upstream for the nearly 10 years I've been playing darts.\n\nAverages are more thing, but aren't accurate enough for me, mostly due to the range fluctuations of that most darts have for the number of darts they complete a leg.  Solid 65 shooters with ranges from 13-33 darts, granted the numbers for those level players tend to be heavily skewed in the 17-25 range with the averages being around 22 darts.\n\nI track checkout rates in my singles league and not just show that but also try to graph it up in some context.  Here's an example: http://bayareadarts.com/2015_fall/stats/stats.w13_html_4d4c1a9.png
I wish I could, Android pay and Google wear with smart lock don't play well. I really miss Google wallet. 
You sir are all over the place! lol
Thanks for cutting out that stupid sign...lol
More importantly smartlock with Android Wear doesn't unlock Android pay. You need to tap, enter a pin, and tap again. Or turn your Bluetooth off and unlock your phone.  I miss Google wallet. :(
How does it feel?

Sounds like a pretty cool idea. I would love to see something like this.
I broke mine... :( You had to pull down the headliner right?\n
Waterproof, wireless charging and front facing stereo speakers are a must for me on new phones.  Sucks the pixels are suggested to lack all of that.

I got grandfathered in Android pay with chase. 
No front facing speakers and a smaller screen. Count me out. 
It lacks a ton of features when compared to Fitbit and it shouldn't since we are paying upwards to 3 times as much for these! I really hope Google steps up their game!
It sounds good and has a lockscreen player. Other than that the UI is terrible and annoying to navigate. I'd switch in a heart beat to shuttle if it could sound as good. 
For the period I worked there,  I can see why they want to get out. It's like stepping back in time when you get on the floors. 
I'm pulling for you. I posted as many places as I could think of. Sorry dude,  hope things get better. I would absolutely lose it if I was you. 
How is the EQ?\n
No Chicago.... :/
That went as expected.. lol
Just found out from Google that feature is "exclusive" to the pixel. Thanks Google!
So pretty much the same phone as the 6P except a bit more ram, smaller screen, better cpu, and no front facing speakers.  Looks like I'm hanging on to the Nexus 6P for another year.  Wish they had some consistency within the nexus phones.

I would assume you would want to start a workout in Google Fit in this case... 
Apparently that was my buddies car that had just sold to a dealership not too long before this. 
Oh ok, I subscribed.  That won't do me any good... lol
I have the new Ventra app in beta and you will love it! It's basically built for Metra , since it doesn't support NFC payments. 
I as already in the beta program, checked for updates and got 7.0. WOOT WOOT
Omg this guy is horrible 
Do any of these backs feel like the oneplus one back? 
Ya, I still think wearables are inherently more health/fitness based.
I miss it so much!!! That and the sandstone back!
They should have just called it Play TV so fucking stupid!
You are so full of farts...
Living in Chicago and in the suburbs I can tell you that sewer steam in unrelated. We don't have steam systems like this and when it gets really cold steam comes out of the sewers. 
Go Hawks!
I'd love this phone with the oneplus one back! 
You just hit it on the head. I loved my OPO the most out of any phone I have ever had. But with cyanogen's attitude and almost lack of support. I would wait to do it again. Right now my rank is 1) Nexus 6P 2) OPO 3) Note 3 4) Nexus 6

The gif integration is a requirement after using this app! 
Holly fuck! This is scary as shit, just like people getting locked out of PSN.
I feel like this is just shooting yourself in the foot as far as sales. What real benefit does this have? 
I can see my office from there! 
Yes! Very! They are pulling the Apple bs on this one...

Ya on Waveland and Clark and they went on for a while. Took a peek, tons of cops nothing else. By the amounts of shots I was concerned it was something more than a handgun and maybe a assault rifle. Hope no one is injured.
Did you guys see anyone to point you in the right direction? 
Making the switch to Dialpad very shortly, I'm pretty excited.
Just leave your shoes on lol
A kayak on a roof rack. Oops. How long did it take you?
Too much money when you consider you need Comcast Internet.  May even need to pay for unlimited Comcast Internet.

Fuck this! 
So then Berwyn and Forest Park are in... lol
No better than the Nexus 6P... Maybe next year..
WTF? Where is the repost?
The blue line was running perfectly when we got 20" a few years ago. Almost couldn't make it with my car.  They do an awesome job at keeping it running.  20 times more reliable then Metra!

Thanks dude! I really needed this!
If you buy a big phone you immediately sacrifice one handed use. That's the risk you take, not need to adopt an OS to make this better. We got the big phone for the screen real-estate, adding a bottom bar that takes up more of that space doesn't make it any better.
Please tell you had the [RAZR V3x](https://imgur.com/gallery/UJT8N) phone like me!
I am going crazy with the stock equalizer! It's terrible when you compare it to poweramp. I've been dying for them to fix this! I can't make the switch to Google play music or or sweet music players because they all sound like crap.

Wow everyone is really rough on this guy. This is how dreams get shattered. 
Is there a 'Better Nonprofit Bureau' I can complain to? 
I'm too busy raking with my rake to explain it to you.
No, in general, it doesn't. Good decent people suffer, big assholes live in luxury all over the place. They even become bigger assholes the more their world makes sense to them. The psychopath that doesn't care about anything is always in control of the situation, because after all, '*who cares?*'\n\nWe are only able to make sense of small pockets of the world, and when we do the people who benefit from the status quo make sure that those instances become well known and put forward as normal. There are enough scraps of these sense-making pockets of the world to prevent an all out revolt.  Those, for whom the world makes no sense -- i.e. the hard working poor, the reasonable, the decent, etcetera -- there is no magic that causes for them to get what they deserve. The role of luck is widely discounted. There is a big problem in our world called *criminalizing poverty*. It is the idea that you make your own luck, and if things don't work out for you, it is your own fault.\n\n
Metaphysics is the study of questions that are, in principle, unanswerable. Whatever you could possibly do to try to get an answer inevitably depends on presuming some answer already. No scientific experiment can be done, and no amount of introspection will give a solidly grounded answer. \n\nFor instance, if you want to know the nature of time, we exist within some timeline, and therefore any experiment that can be done is conducted within this timeline and therefore is assumed. If you want to know about the nature of subjective experience, we only have what our subjective experience shows to us as an answer. Etcetera. Etcetera.\n\nIf a question is unanswerable *in principle*, then we can hardly be held morally responsible for some particular answer to it. So it is just more reasonable to take the position that the answers to metaphysical questions just should not be used to justify any particular position on questions in other areas such as morality, aesthetics, social philosophy, etcetera.
Well, it isn't the job of philosophy to help your psychology. So if you find that it is getting in the way of moving forward in life, you should seek out some kind of help if it is available to you.\n\nIt seems to me that you take intellectual values seriously, and that is outstanding. Your intellect should govern, not your psychology. That is why I mentioned logic. If you take considering the solipsistic theory seriously, then you should also take logic seriously, and logic doesn't support solipsism. \n\nOne thing about being intellectual, is that you have to be able to "entertain" a theory without actually committing to believing it. You should be able to say what a person who believes X would say about issue Y. You should be able to imagine what is it like to think the way others think, without actually thinking the way they think sincerely.\n\n
Well one couldn't blame you for skepticism in the /r/logic subreddit could one?\n\nBut it does look like credible report from a close friend.
Forsooth.
Almost none of them are. The only ones that ever turned out to be true were... TWA flight 800, which even the mainstream media has now acknowledged...and that the CIA introduced crack into the inner cities, which was the subject of the film *Kill The Messenger.*\n\nConspiracy theories are just an attempt to make sense of a world that doesn't make sense. It is a psychological defense mechanism.\n\nJoin a skeptics club.
Walt became Heisenberg, but Heisenberg became Ozymandias in the end. So he became just who he was going to be in the end.\n\nRemember that Ozymandias (i.e. Ramses II) was the ancient emperor that lost everything.
Tom Hanks didn't appear in the movie *Babe* which won in 1995. If he had, that alone would have qualified it. 
I have this great argument that totally refutes the Ontological Argument. In fact, not only is this argument a sound argument, but it happens to be the *perfect* argument. Just hearing it or reading it compels you to adopt its conclusion as your own sincere true belief immediately.\n\nOf course, being the perfect argument, in addition to its being perfectly compelling, it also possesses all of the other qualities that a perfect argument should have. \n\nSo therefore, obviously, this argument exists. After all, it wouldn't be perfect if it didn't exist now would it? The Ontological Argument is totally refuted.\n\nQ.E.D.
It's "all right."
Why would I find it an interesting poetic or rhetorical possibility? There is no logical accounting for that. Rhetoric and poetry do not care about how concise sentences are.\n\nI think the main point is that "ampersand" is a noun, so it doesn't make a grammatically valid sentence as used above. \n\n"I'm appointing Fred dog Ed to the committee." is the same form. If that form doesn't work, it isn't grammatical no matter what the words mean.

It would be difficult to construct whole convex districts of approximately equal population for various reasons. But you definitely are on the right track.\n\nMy proposal is similar...\n\nThe majority leader appoints a committee that draws the boundaries of sub-districts one third the population of a whole district. All such sub-districts are required to be convex (state lines and coastlines do not affect convexity).\n\nThen the minority leader appoints a committee to construct contiguous whole districts from the sub-districts.\n\nThis simple solution is based on the same principle that is used to cut a piece of cake fairly. 
In what sense is /r/antifa not standing up to racism? I mean even if we are supposed to take this guy seriously, there isn't any substantial point about racism to stand up to. 
[The Berry paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_paradox).\n\nThere exists a smallest number not nameable in less than twenty-four syllables. \n\nBut the phrase, "the smallest number not nameable in less than twenty-four syllables" is twenty-three syllables, and yet it names the same number.  
Biological entities obey a different set of rules than the rules of math or physics. You could say that being alive means that the object in question has broken free from being determined solely on math and physics. \n\nIf you take a point on the object and trace it's path through space you will always be able to construct a mathematical function (consistent with the laws, [or axioms] of physics) that describes the path it takes if the object is not alive (and also not attached to some living object).\n\nIf you were to trace a path based on the tip of my finger, there is no such function. That path is determined by my will.\n\nAll of this is subject to philosophical theories about life and free will, etcetera. But think it is a pretty convenient way to understand it.
Somewhere in your area there has to be some kind of food closet or soup kitchen that provides free food. You have to get creative.\n\n(BTW, I also forgot that I added BBQ sauce to my recipe).
I can tell you that what I have stated is correctly written. I have no idea about your side. I don't know if A) you misread your lecturer's statement, B) your lecturer is messing with you, or C) your lecturer is wrong. But it has to be something like that.\n\nI can tell you that "P -> ¬P" as you have written is invalid. That would be the same as "P → ~P" which is ~~a contradiction~~ false when P is true.\n\nWhat *is* valid is "P→ ~~P" \n\nThat's called the principle of double negation.\n\n
I have no idea why everyone else is making it complicated. Your lecturer made a blatant mistake or is trying to trick you into thinking it through. The principle of double negation is that:\n\n* P → ~~P\n\nand also\n\n* ~~P → P\n\nSorry for the confusion. ( see also [double negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negation) )
There is one way to prove it, but you won't like it. \n\nAny particular person that you could name from 1000 years ago is almost certainly one of your ancestors anyway. The number of ancestors that you would have had alive 1000 years ago is about 1 trillion (2 to the power of approximately 40 generations). There were only about 300 million people alive at the time. \n\nStatistically speaking, it would be almost impossible for you to avoid being this person's descendant.
The existence of a sound argument compels belief. \n\nIf a person agreed that "There is a cat sitting on the floor." That person would have to be compelled to also believe that "It is not the case that there is not a cat sitting on the floor." If not, we would just call that person an unreasonable person.\n\nThe existence of sound arguments compel the belief in their conclusions. So if you are just trying to assign a special status to the greatness of God, you are doing a bunch of hand-waving. \n\nMy original point is that the Ontological Argument and its many and varied formulations are extreme nonsense, and should not fool anyone. But unfortunately there are some people so invested in its conclusion that they are willing to throw away all sense and logic using conceptual gymnastics so as to preserve it.\n\nThere is zero difference between the ontological greatness of my argument, and the greatness of God. Both of their "greatnesses" stand in equal need of justification.\n\nIn fact, I would say that the greatness of my argument is greater than the putative greatness of God, since arguments only claim to exist on an intellectual level, and therefore it fails less miserably than the Ontological Argument for the existence of God which purports to proof that God exists somewhere other than the mind.

I don't know. It could be a circular account. This Alan White may have just read /r/logic .
The general consensus is that neo-logicism is a valid theory that was arrived at using valid methodology. That is not to say that it is universally accepted (especially by mathematicians who, to be fair, are not the experts in that subject matter), but it is not going away anytime soon.

I hear that a lot of jazz musicians drink coffee (and you know that crowd). \n\nI also heard they drink a lot of coffee to celebrate on Hitler's birthday.
Not really. I am responding directly to the point you put forward. My response to you was that *the existence* of a sound argument compels belief. So there is no difference between the invalid claim that the perfection of God implies His existence and the invalid claim that the perfection of my argument implies its existence.\n\n> Anselm is talking about what makes things great qua being, whereas you are talking about what makes things great qua providing reasons to believe something.\n\nYou are trying to assign some special status to the existence of God over the existence of a sound argument. Your claim is that God's existence is so special that the principles of logic and epistemology don't apply to the question. That's not valid.\n\nWhat makes the argument I put forward an obviously ridiculous parody that should not fool anyone is the same thing that makes the Ontological Argument ridiculous. The problem is that people always see the problems with *other people's* religious and metaphysical beliefs very clearly, but never see the exact same thinking in their own beliefs. \n\nSo the response is always the same: "Oh, those aren't the same at all!" But in reality they are.
I'm sorry but that is so far off I have to wonder what you have been reading. Corporatism is the defining feature of fascism. All the other features that are commonly put forward (e.g. centralization of authority, suppression of opposition, increased police and military power, rampant nationalism) only serve to support the fundamental political culture of corporatism over individualism.\n\nI am referring to academic literature, not the more commonly put forward materials. Take a look at William Stewart's *Understanding Politics*, which was a pretty popular textbook, as well as articles by Umberto Eco on *Ur-Fascism*, the essay which started the modern and now contemporary movement, *The Doctrine of Fascism* by Mussolini and Gentile.\n\n
You will find that it is a long term interest. You may not make progress right away, but try to set yourself up for making progress years later. That means getting as much of your known information out there so that the other people also looking into it will be able to make connections with you. Sign up for free accounts on familysearch.org, wikitree.com and ancestry.com. If you are committed to it, get some software such as Gramps.\n\nGet all of your known information in one place (file folders, index cards or whatever else you use). Your goal should be to collect dates and places for birth, christening/baptism, marriage, death, and burial for your ancestors and their siblings. In general, you want to work backwards through time. That is, that the burial information will give you clues for the death information. The death information will give you clues for the marriage information. The marriage information will give you clues for the birth information, etcetera, etcetera. \n\nThe census will give you information on a whole family at a time. If you run into problems, start researching the siblings. That will give you a lot of clues about where people are, and parentage, etcetera.\n\nIf the online sources dry up you may need to break down and actually write a physical letter once in a while to a county clerks office, a secretary of state's office, a church parish office, or a cemetery office.\n\nDon't be bashful about asking for help. That means here in this sub, or out there contacting cousins, or other people also working on the same family tree. Good luck.
Um, we are not exactly *desperate* to do those things these days. It's actually *pretty easy*. \n\nWhat --*ahem*--, uh, what was the highest level of education *you* attained perchance? I'm just curious.
The primary thing to understand about fascism is that it is a form of corporatism -- the belief that the corporate group, not the individual person is the fundamental unit of society.\n\nFascism is the attempt to recreate the conditions of the Middle Ages, when a serf served on the estate of a lord. All of the benefits of society came to the serf only through his service to the estate. They did not have a notion of individual rights, but rather were raised with the value that the interests of the estate were the priority. This is known as "tory corporatism."\n\nLater, there was an Age of Enlightenment, and people started to adopt more humanist values. They started to have a sense of their own value as individual persons. This was a problem for the "lords" of the day. So they found an increasing need to use police force to create the conditions of a corporate political culture. This is fascism (may also be called "fascist corporatism").\n\nWhereas the tory corporatist political culture is established and on-going due to strong traditions, the fascist political culture requires police and military power to recreate the conditions of feudalism.
In New England we call it a "clambake."
This sentence isn't real.
No that's not true at all. Emergency services are based on the boundaries of the municipality (i.e. towns, cities, and counties). The districts for electing state and federal senators and representatives are completely independent of that. A town, city or county may be in two or more such districts and often are.
It would be more reasonable to believe that I was hallucinating than it would be to believe that what I was seeing was real.\n\nThat's how that situation works in real life, not the fantasy reality that most religious believers live in.
The logicist project has been reformed and revived with an expanded notion of logic. Philosophers such as Crispin Wright have put forward that we are perfectly able to express all of mathematics as logical truths. This makes perfect sense, as we always want our mathematical truths to be A) true, and B) logical (i.e. "rational" or "to make sense.").\n\nThis project is called neo-logicism.
No, the comment is made in good faith, and I would hope that people would have gotten more intellectual value out of it. Your loss.\n\nIf a question is *in principle* unanswerable, then one can hardly be held morally responsible for knowing or acting in accordance with some particular answer to it. Yet, this is the basis of action for many people who do a great many questionable things.
You would be surprised at how far you can stretch a can. I can tell you I did this very thing recently.\n\nIf you have other things to add to it you should. In my case, I added\n\n* one can of kidney beans\n* one can of corn\n* one can of green beans\n* one can of tomatoes (in my case they were stewed, and I took them out and chopped them up a bit, you can add salsa or any other tomato thing)\n* one can of tomato soup\n* a dash of Worcestershire\n* a spoonful of sugar\n* some water to loosen it up (or a can of beer, or a glass of red wine)\n* a spoonful of corn starch to tighten it up\n\nCook on low heat for an hour.\n\nDon't limit yourself. You can throw in carrots, onions, celery, other beans, etcetera. Eat it with corn bread, crackers, regular bread, etc.\n\nI ended up with just sort of a gallon of chili. The end product tasted like chili just as the one can would have. I even served some of it on top of my eggs and toast. In any case, you should sneak some kind of veggies into it some how.
Gramps free software makes several different kinds of reports, including graphs, graphical reports and text based reports. I think you are mainly interested in what Gramps calls the "Hourglass Graph" for descendants. The Hourglass Graph for the descendants of my second great grandparents [LOOKS LIKE THIS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_oHEdRanG0qd1ItbjhZeWVrWDg/view?usp=sharing). (You can set yours to include all the private info such as bithdates, etctera if you want to).\n\nWhen you create the report it gives you the option of setting the paper size. You can set it to a custom size and then go to a print shop to have them print it out. It also includes all the standard paper sizes up to size "E." The one I have linked is size "E" paper which is 34" x 44" 
We don't have to wait for the ovens to fire up before we call it what it is. \n\nTrump is so clearly a fascist, that I am very troubled by anyone's reluctance to call him such. Unfortunately, the term is such that even when one uses it in a completely accurate manner, the impression is being from the lunatic fringe. It is almost by design. If you go that far you've crossed some kind of line. It makes it impossible to criticize real fascists.\n\nTrump is a textbook example of fascism. When I say textbook, I mean that literally. When you study political culture formally, and academically, you have a deeper understanding, and use terminology differently than the average person out there with largely conventional views. For instance, the term "liberal" is the opposite of "conservative" for the average person. Whereas to political scientists and philosophers it is a specific political culture that includes classical liberalism such as  the Founding Fathers and the Republicans of the 1970s, and social liberalism which includes most contemporary progressives and Democrats.\n\nAbout 4 months ago I posted [an explanation in a comment of why Trump is a fascist](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/54hquu/redditor_explains_why_trump_is_a_fascist_in_detail/). It was picked up by someone else in /r/antifa as a [submitted link with a discussion of its own](https://np.reddit.com/r/antifa/comments/4zvtnb/tell_me_what_fascism_is/d70lrqt/).  Please do check out the original discussion at least. I also state why the Repubican Party in general can no longer be considered a classical liberal party, but rather, a fascist insurgency. Please see [Chomsky's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn6KipA2TRA) on that issue.\n\nThat post was before the election. Since then Trump has moved forward with the merger of corporate interests with the government. This, is what the implementation of fascism looks like. Camps and ovens aren't defining features of fascism. They are just logical consequences of that particular developed and unchecked fascist state. Contemporary fascists are smart enough to avoid those particular triggers to popular opposition, and stick to more subtle practices and terminology.\n\nYou see the fundamental issue is that of the individual citizen's interests versus the corporate interest. All of Trumps' nominations consist of the fox guarding each hen house for the benefit of corporate interests. THAT is what fascism is.

It wouldn't work. It would be more reasonable to believe that you were hallucinating than it would be to believe that any such "god proving" scenario is real. That goes for pretty much every crazy scenario that the believers put forward to atheists when they ask such questions.\n\nIn fact, it is a serious matter because hallucinations can be a symptom of a serious condition such as a brain tumor. I wonder how many people have died because they chose to believe their subjective religious experiences rather than go to the doctor.
Grapefruit is a natural hybrid of mandarin and pomelo. At some point after the 17th century some trees of each were planted near each other and cross-pollinated. This happened in the Caribbean. The grapefruit did not exist in pre-Columbian Europe.
Federal and state governments should not hire from private universities -- public universities only. The private sector in general has decided to go on its own and take everything. So they deserve to be on their own.\n\nPrivate schools, charter schools and homeschooling should be illegal in general as they are in more civilized nations.
To further and preserve intellectual values.\n\nUltimately, it is our ideas that are the most important. We should have as a goal to make sure that the contents of the libraries and museums of the world are preserved in some form, so that others may benefit from it.\n\nEven our own lives are not as important as this. The human race could go extinct, and yet the ability to re-create human beings using medical science could result if only someone had the knowledge to do so.
The simple solution to Gerrymandering:\n\nThe majority leader appoints a committee that draws the boundaries of sub-districts one third the population of a whole district. All such sub-districts are required to be convex (state lines and coastlines do not affect convexity).\n\nThen the minority leader appoints a committee to construct contiguous whole districts from the sub-districts.\n\nThis simple solution is based on the same principle that is used to cut a piece of cake fairly.

In addition to these other good answers to your question, I think you may find the [Alabama Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_paradox#Alabama_paradox) of interest. On one occasion when they increased the size of the House they had a mathematician calculate all of the possible configurations from 275 to 350. They had an interesting development when they discovered that at 299 Alabama would get 8, but at 300 Alabama would get 7. This was totally counter-intuitive and they had to double check the math. But it is true. The reason is that the function that describes the increase of a state's apportionment relative to the size of the House is a *non-monotonic* function. Perhaps the politics that arise from this paradox also discourage increasing the numbers.\n\nAnother consequence of increasing the size of the House is that the Electoral College would also increase in size. The E.C.'s membership is based on the membership of the House and Senate with the restriction that no member of Congress can serve in the Electoral College.\n

> Those rules don't govern the rock's actions.\n\nActually, yes they do. If the executive administrator of that department made the determination, a crew would come out and move the rock with heavy equipment, etc. Just to be perfectly clear, it is this social entity whose rules *ultimately* govern the motion of the rock, not math and/or physics. I don't see any way around that. Any person can disprove your theory immediately just by lifting a paperclip.\n\n> not hard to explain\n\nSorry, I have a great deal of respect for science (you and I both know that O'Reilly is a complete idiot), but you've got some serious hand-waving going on if you thing math and science explain social and intellectual behavior. I'm not just talking about the obviously extreme difficulty of constructing some kind of axiomatic proof of the principles governing complex activity. We have examples in the world where there just plain exists whole different sets of rules governing the behavior of things. Just in physics we have quantum, and classical mechanics. In biology, you would be hard pressed to even put forward a set of "axioms." In society, we have customs and laws. In the realm of ideas we have dreams, fiction, emotion and, for instance, postmodern nonsense that occurs. It strains our conceiveability to say that it is possible to express my behavior in, for instance, choosing to type the phrases "refrigerator," "tree trunk," and "belly dancer" in this post in terms of math and physics.\n\nIt would seem that your position is the one going far out on a limb with its claims, not mine. Don't get me wrong. I respect the scholarly and academic methodology that puts determinism within consideration. But you have to admit, that it is usually the mathematicians' impression that its the philosophers who waste their time on nonsense, not the other way around. Are there any mathematicians seriously working on axiomatizing the principles of biology, society, psychology, etcetera? How are they doing?

Metaphysics is the scholarly and academic study of all the philosophical questions which are in principle unanswerable.\n\nMetaphysics is also the study of all the questions, the answers to which should make absolutely no difference in your life unless you actually are an academic metaphysician.﻿

> Logic doesn't need to apply to philosophy necessarily\n\nYes, it does. Otherwise you are no longer doing philosophy. Philosophy isn't just any old thing. There are valid methods just like science has valid methods.\n\nThe issue you bring up about solipsism is in the subject area of epistemology. It is part of the bigger question known as "the problem of other minds." For instance, how do we know that my subjective experience of seeing green is the same as your subjective experience? After all you can't enter my mind. It could be that your green is my red. We would never know it because it is possible that we are just using language and reacting to colored objects in a manner consistent with our own experience. But it would take a highly complex system of A) subjective experiences, B) physical objects, and C) uses of language to make it work out all the time. It is just more reasonable to believe that we just have the same experience of green. But, on the other hand we do have studies that show that some cultures use different words inconsistently with other cultures, and even women may see colors differently to men, etcetera. But these differences don't seem to be wildly different.  \n\n> research Buddhism further and see if that spiritual ideology is right for me.\n\nWell I'm biased, so I would not put too much stock in it. But everyone is different and maybe you could get something out of it. It is really no longer doing philosophy once you enter into religious belief. (We in the philosophy game would hate to lose you).\n\nAs far as logic is concerned, I would recommend starting with some basic concepts like learning the fallacies, term logic (also called "traditional logic," "Aristotelean logic," or "syllogistic logic"), then propositional logic, and then predicate logic. There are a lot of youtube videos which focus on each of these topics. Most books on the subject are straight up textbooks. Some well known authors are Copi, Hurley, Moore and Parker. If you want some more readable and entertaining material try Smullyan (who just died about a week ago). Smullyan wrote numerous books on logic puzzles. In his early days he wrote an introduction to logic too. \n\nPerhaps if you want to pursue it, you should also look into some epistemology literature (i.e. "the problem of other minds"), but I would start with logic.
Not using only words, sentences and paragraphs.
You asked the question. Of course the world doesn't make sense. At least I took you seriously.\n\nWhen Kennedy got shot people flipped out. How could a single loser like Oswald take out our handsome hero? That's why we have all the conspiracy theories. Some bigger scheme just made more sense to many people.
In logic, "some" means "at least one." So you have them on that point.\n\nThe discussion seems to have collapsed at a pretty primitive stage of development. I wonder what the two of you have to say about vat-grown meat? We are starting to have the technology to grow meat in a vat of chemicals without any living animals to harvest. The layer of meat develops on the surface of the vat of chemicals, and they just scoop or peel it up and there is a slice of meat! In fact, since it is a muscle, they have little robotic fingers that come down and poke at it so that it gets exercise as it grows.\n\nSo is this acceptable to eat for vegetarians? Should we sell it in the produce aisle? 
A European family would have to have lived in a remote mountain area or island for 40 generations with no contact with any other people in order for it not to be true.

It's simple. Private schools just shouldn't exist in an open and democratic society because they are *not open* and *undemocratic.*\n\nFrance doesn't have any private schools. They are often shocked to learn that there are private schools in the US. It used to be a long time ago that in France when you took the train, there was a first class car that cost a little more, and a second class car for everyone else. They got rid of that because it goes against the principles of a democratic society. Even their planes do not have a first class.\n\nPrivate schools teach students that *democracy is a problem* and the solution to the problem is to take your wealth and look out for number one, and screw everyone else who doesn't have wealth. What you are supposed to do to make schools better when they have problems is to have an open and public meeting of the school board, with all the stakeholders participating and work together to solve the problem. That is how a democracy works.\n\nThe long term effects of this lesson that democracy is a problem, is what we get in Michigan. They have laws that when a municipality or special district (i.e. school district, park and rec district, water district, etcetera) has financial problems, the state has the power to appoint a special master that acts with all the authority of whatever elected board previously had authority. It literally is the appointment of a dictator on a localized level. You see, the whole premise of this practice is that *democracy is the problem*.  (BTW, the US has a huge debt that may one day be significant enough that solutions are demanded. So what can we conclude if this is how we handle it at the local level?!?!)\n\nI really don't think people fully understand the long-term consequences of private schools, charter schools and homeschooling. It shelters students from viewpoints that are different from those of the parents. That is a very anti-intellectual environment. It takes control away from the people and puts it directly in the hands of the rich and powerful. Even scholarships only make it possible for rich people to remain in control by choosing who gets a scholarship and who doesn't. The understanding for the need for social change is completely taken away from the very people who, in the future will be in the position to make it.\n\nThese schools also destroy community values because a whole segment of the community is no longer part of the community. Almost everyone remembers their school colors and mascot from high school if you ask them. Surveys have found this question gets over 95% of people who remember them. That is the power of a school in forming community values.\n\nI'm telling you that private, home and charter schools are not just contributing, but the primary cause of a decline of civilization itself.
My response to this is always the same. "This is a little embarrassing to have to point out, but *technically* it's the theists who 'believe in nothing.'"
Mmmh Hmmm. I'm going to call it a hunch, but I'm going to say you never graduated, and probably didn't attend college.\n\nWhy don't you just *say so*?! Aren't you proud of it? After all, education is just liberal propaganda, right? Those egg-headed scholars and academics are just pushing an agenda, right. You avoided all of that and are ahead of the game! Screw those scientists and their evolutionism and climate change nonsense.\n\nI'm just so glad that there was a nation of people just like you who know better than all those so-called intellectuals, and *really showed them* this last election!

I would say that since we are meaning-creating beings, that our purpose is to create meaning!\n\nThere is no "meaning of life," there is only meaning in particular lives. It is our purpose to create meaning in our own lives.
There is a lot of random activity in the universe, but not everything is random. \n\nEverything that exists can be classified as belonging to one or more of the following categories: physical objects, biological entities, social entities, and concepts. Obviously, some things are more than one of these, and the question is what is it *primarily?* A human being is a physical object, but we are not *primarily* physical objects. We are primarily our mental content, i.e. we are the idea of ourselves. It's not your body that wants to know the answer to this question, it's your mind.\n\nFor each of these levels of existence there are rules that apply to that level that governs what happens to them.  An asteroid is a rock flying through space and therefore is completely determined by the laws of physics. But *Plymouth Rock* is a rock that is not primarily a physical object, it is a historic artifact and our Department of the Interior or Parks Department determines what happens to it.\n\nBut whether or not humanity has meaning has little to do with randomness. Human beings are meaning-creating beings. We create our own meaning and purposes.
If it were the case that you were in fact imagining them every single day without fail, it wouldn't matter anymore that it was only imagined. It would be reality itself at that point.\n\nAll the non-solipsititic criticisms that one could levy at our understanding of reality would stand in the same relation to reality as the solipsistic ones.\n\nTake comfort in the fact that even the greatest philosophers of all time struggled with the existential crisis too.
There are an infinite number of rational explanations for any given set of facts (Pirsig's law). But the number of *valid* interpretations is a very small subset of that.\n\nThere always exists a rational explanation for any set of facts, but whether or not that explanation is always eventually known is a different question. There are a great many unexplained facts throughout history, and in fact the vast majority of the facts that ever occurred were unknown, and therefore went unexplained. But even the vast majority of known facts also went unexplained, (except in the very general sense that, for instance, the laws of physics are known and explain all of the physical facts that ever occurred.) But that only accounts for "facts." The belief that all the facts of the world are completely explainable by science is known as "scientism."\n\nThe existence of analytic truths, such as "all bachelors are unmarried" serves as a counterexample which no amount of science adds any explanation. The truths of aesthetics, ethics, logic and mathematics all fall under that category. But these are not considered to be the same as "facts" but rather are classified as "truths."\n\nAre all of the truths of the world explainable? I believe that explanations can be constructed using analysis, moral reasoning, and logical or mathematical proofs. But in the case of aesthetics and ethics, the validity of these explanations can be highly questionable because there are a vast number of perspectives and conflicting theories.\n\nHowever, the truths of metaphysics are certainly unknowable, and therefore unexplainable. Inevitably, any explanation of a metaphysical truth requires us to assume some principle of metaphysics that depends on that metaphysical truth we are trying to explain.\n\nBut, if you just don't care about metaphysics, ethics and aesthetics, you can explain quite a lot. Unfortunately, you then won't have a very deep and meaningful understanding of the world.\n\nFinally, there can't really be an "explanation of the world" as a whole because that explanation would also exist within our world and stand in need of additional explanation. So I have to go back to my earlier statement that we are only able to explain small pockets of the world at a time so that they "make sense."\n\nIn other words, there is no "meaning of life." There is only meaning of and in particular lives.

There are a couple of other things you should think about.\n\nPhenomenological methodology includes a device called "bracketing" (or "epoche"). Bracketing is just leaving the question aside and proceeding as if you have a solid answer to see where it leads you. When you are at the intellectual tangle, just "bracket" the question and proceed on with your life.\n\nThe other thing is in my original response about the phrase "it is reasonable to believe..." This is actually quite a powerful phrase that should lend a great deal of comfort. My recommendation to you (and everyone) is to study some logic. You will have a greater appreciation for all the things that can be claimed to be reasonable. In this case, it sounds like it could help.
It is a good question. They are different. In  situations like these, if you are ever in doubt you should take the time to make a truth table.\n\nYou can also try to translate into plain English if it is not too complex. "Not A AND Not B" is the same as saying that it is not the case that "A OR B" is true. "It is not the case that A AND B are both true" is the same as saying that either Not-A is true OR Not-B is true (i.e. one of A or B has to be false).\n\nDeMorgans's laws make all of this pretty clear, and if all else fails just try to learn DeMorgans by rote memory. It will kick in eventually.
Gee, who would have ever guessed that something like that would happen?
Every day when you wake up in the morning, you go about your day. The world behaves as if solipsism is false. It appears very much as if there are real other people, also having the subjective experience of being alive, having emotions, seeing colors, hearing sounds, etcetera.\n\nIt happened this morning when you woke up. It happened yesterday when you woke up. It happened the day before, and the day before.\n\nIt is reasonable to believe that it will continue to happen again tomorrow, and the next day, etcetera.
You are correct in that it is not a contradiction, but it is also not a tautology. It is false when Q is true. It is more properly called a "contingent statement."\n\nThis is because it is a counterfactual statement when ~Q is true. If a statement is true, then any statement (true or false) implies it.
> No you couldn't.\n\nActually, yes you could. It looks like we have a hard determinist on our hands here. Well, that is one position that is considered valid in some circles, but unfortunately there are a great many metaphysically libertarian philosophers that would disagree with you. You certainly would be hard pressed to prove it. \n\nPlease also observe the careful use of the word "solely" in my response. There do obviously exist different sets of rules that determine behavior depending on the ontological status of the object in question. A rock such as an asteroid is solely determined by the rules of math and physics. But a rock such as Plymouth Rock is determined by the rules of the Department of Conservation and Recreation for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. If they want to move it, those rules will *ultimately* govern its action not math or physics. (Please observe my careful use of the term "ultimately" so as to directly contradict your position.)\n\nYou would be hard pressed to express the rules of social entities such as a state agency in terms of math and physics. In fact, it sounds preposterous on the face of it. So with such a substantial burden of proof, the mathematicians and physicists have a project on their hands for the next few hundred, if not thousand years (if they choose to take your position seriously).\n\n\n\n

Technically no. The word "ampersand" is not itself a logical connective.

This would be the logical extension of what you are doing.\n\nBut I do find it to be an interesting poetic or rhetorical possibility that would be understood by most.

Plants don't have nervous systems or anything similar. They are physically incapable of pain. They lack subjectivity and sentience. Are you seriously prepared to argue in good faith against this?

Maybe. Not all vets care about animals the same as not all MDs care about people. Veterinary medicine is something some people do for money alone, just like anything else.   \n\nThere are lots of ways to make a good living that don't require a medical degree. And not everyone can be or wants to be a doctor. So being a vet doesn't necessarily mean one cares so much for animals that they sacrificed a guaranteed higher income as an MD or that they could've or would've completed medical school.  \n\nI'm sure most vets care about animals, but most aren't opposed to eating or wearing some of them either.

So you're saying they do feel pain, they try to avoid pain, it is similar to pain in humans to some degree, and we can't know how they subjectively experience pain. To which you conclude it is ridiculous to avoid causing them pain and/or empathize with their pain.  Do I understand you?

\nLegally, donations to Super PAC's can not go directly to a campaign and they aren't supposed to coordinate in any way with a candidate. Also they are required to publish contributions to the SP. I think this method of donating to a shell corp and Trump loaning himself the same amount from the shell Corp and then bankrupting it to remove it from filing requirements is technically more like laundering than a SP is.
I used to do commercial loans, and the in-depth part is all about the business plan and a good bit of due dilagence about the pricipals track record, and their personal credit history. A clean credit report carried a lot of weight though. Same with a bad one. A business plan can look lovely and sure-fire, but a personal credit history says a lot about how much the principal cares about how they take care of things. We used to run into people all the time with a sterling appearing business rep and shitty personal credit. They, every single one, said they didn't have time for that shit, and almost every single one defaulted on the business loan one way or another. Personal credit just says a lot about someone's financial habits. 
He's still paying Prime+5 on the debt though. That money is going somewhere. Is he paying himself or the original investor, and isn't that a pretty high rate to pay? Doesn't seem like someone in his supposed financial position would have to pay a rate that high without good reason. As in that's the best he could get? 
I wonder if those threads are present in Trump's tax documents. 
> . With Trump owning the Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC—and the LLC being owed $50 million or more by Trump—this company should be listed on Trump's disclosure as worth at least that much, unless it has debt offsetting this amount.\n\nThis is where Trump differs from the rest of us. If we need a loan to say, buy a house, we go to the bank, put up a down payment and get a mortgage. If we can't make the payment or go bankrupt, we lose the house.\n\nBut in Trump's little shell game, if he can't repay his $50M loan to his LLC, the LLC goes bankrupt and Trump keeps the money.
This and his repeated bankruptcy schemes is really where all his money comes from. He's a huckster.
This isn't remotely legal, for the record. 
Is this just coming out from the Mirror? Or is it more widespread? 
I guess it depends on how old the loan is then. Bankruptcies go away after awhile, seven to ten years, and so do bad credit entries or they're supposed to anyway. That's how he was able to do that many bankruptcies. So if this loan is fairly recent it's from someone doing him a favor and expecting a big  roi. Following the money would tell the story, if you could get through all the shells in between the lender and Trump. 
Where does this most likely lead?  What are the benefits of loaning your self money?
How is that different from money laundering?

This is all readily public information what confuses me is the people who think this would have been different.
Here's what OP is saying:\n\nHe borrows money from a company he controls. He directs the company to go bankrupt rather than collect its debt. \n\nBecause it's an LLC, a limited liability company, the owner is not responsible for the financial problems of the company. Therefore it goes bankrupt as of it were an entirely separate entity, and the company shuts down. Trump suddenly has $50M and no debt to that company. \n\nThe company got the money from a secret investor, but they don't have to disclose it because they "lost" the money when the loan was defaulted. 
Companies loaning him money are not going to just look at his consumer credit rating ... business loans are a whole different animal, and they go much more in-depth.
He'd already gone bankrupt 4 times, so his credit was probably crap.\n[edit: consistent tenses]
Money laundering uses similar tools and mechanism but the end game is different. \n\nIn money laundering, the money is usually from an "illegal" activity (ie. drugs) so it has to pass by a legal company that usually takes cash as its main method of payment. The legal company then creates a fake transaction and report the amount launder as revenue. The goal is to pass illegal revenue as legal so it doesn't raise suspicions to the authorities. 
He's not loaning himself money, his company got a loan from a secret someone, then his company lend him the same amount as the secret original loaner. \n\nIn effect he has contracted a loan from his own company for monies that are not his company but an outside lender to his company. \n\nThis is to mask the identity of the original lender by going through a shelf company. The main benefit is he doesn't seem to have to declare it as a potential conflict of interest as the shelf company used show a net worth of $0 as a result of both loans.
The mafia. \n\nEnjoy your knees while they're still in good working order. 
And it also remotely doesn't matter.\n\nTrump is essentially too wealthy to be subject to our nation's laws. We should never have allowed anyone in our society to become remotely as wealthy or powerful in the first place.
So this is a perfect way to launder money and a perfect way for Trump to receive secret transactions.

I don't think it's actually a loan, is what the article is claiming. It's a complex way of laundering a payment or donation of $50 million to Trump. 
I no right! For example, Enron went bankrupt. Ken Lay NEVER did.
>In money laundering, the money is usually from an "illegal" activity\n\nThe illegal activity can also be fraud, racketeering, etc. 
A lot of wealthy people have gotten caught doing something similar and even with no jailtime, it's laid a blackmark on their business ventures.  Trump has sort of skated around this by franchising and doing TV since it's a question mark what real estate he directly owns.\n

Any bank that would make that loan almost deserves the loss. 
It's not. AML (anti money laundering) regulations strictly forbid this, however give the the legal loopholes, chances are very slim there is any proof, hence him and many many others getting away with it. \n\nUnless 'someone' leaks the documents clearly linking him or another party to this, I don't see how this would hold up in court.
Oh, no I do not want a secret creditor. Good thing he and his family are protected by the Secret Service then, I suppose.

I'm not OP, but I grew up in DFW and have lived in Austin for six of the past ten years (Houston and DFW for a short stint(s) in the middle; I'm back in Austin now). Please excuse the rant that you are about to read. I'm usually a nicer person than this. For the record, I prefer Austin to both Dallas and Fort Worth. \n\nHere we go.\n\n>Fort Worthians would take exception to that\n\nFort Worthians take offense to *everything* even tangentially related to their city. They get mad about the sports teams in DFW being called Dallas even though two of them are located in Arlington. They get mad when Dallas is shown on a national map but Fort Worth is not. [They get mad about Fort Worth not being explicitly and loudly excluded from stereotypes associated with North Texas or Dallas](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/newscasticassets/images/e3342c5f-5c3c-4e7d-a010-a82a1b9f2255.jpg), as if they believe they are somehow a completely foreign cultural group within North Texas (like the Kurds in the middle east). \n\nI'm not even sure what you're implying that Fort Worthians would get upset about in the above post. Not being mentioned by name? Not including a big asterisk next to "DFW" that provides a disclaimer making it clear that Fort Worth is a special snowflake with nothing in common with DFW at large? (Which is horseshit, as I flesh out below)  \n\nI wish I had a dollar for every time a person from Fort Worth jumps into a conversation - unsolicited - to let everyone know how much better Fort Worth is than Dallas, DFW, and/or the rest of Texas. As a person born in DFW, I get a good self-depriciating chuckle out of the "Keep Dallas Pretentious" stickers and shirts. In reality, though, perhaps "Keep Fort Worth Pretentious" would be a more apt slogan based on the amount of times per capita that people from Fort Worth seem to publicly put their city on a pedestal compared to people from Dallas, Houston, etc. doing the same.  \n\nForth Worth propaganda, examined: \n\n - *Dallas is pretentious because it's a bunch of SMU frat boys all grown up, while Fort Worth is nothing like that.* Ever heard of TCU? It might as well be SMU West. It's a bunch of rich, private school kids, just like SMU, many of whom stay in Fort Worth and enjoy the perks of being born into their city's upper crust. \n - *Dallas suburbs are upper-middle class cookie cutter hells capes.* Ever been to Hurst? Euless Bedford? Southlake? They're all just Plano, but next to Fort Worth instead of Dallas. \n - *Fort Worth is cultured, unlike Dallas.* This one is the best. Fort Worth is made up of 60% non-hispanic white people, compared to Dallas with 28.8%. Does that sound cultured to you? Or does it sound like a bunch of white people doing white people things? Fort Worth's idea of culture is a bunch of paintings of cow herds sold in the occasional art festivals around the stock yards, [the National Cowgirl Musuem](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g55857-d268112-Reviews-National_Cowgirl_Museum_and_Hall_of_Fame-Fort_Worth_Texas.html), and custom cowboy boot makers. Moreover, Dallas' range of ethnic cuisine far outstrips anything Fort Worth has, and it's not even close. (Fort Worth has a pretty baller zoo, though. I'll give them that). \n - *Fort Worth's infrastructure is far superior to Dallas' infrastructure.* Dallas Area Rapid Transit is the best mass transit in Texas. There's no contest. It's not perfect, but it's much better than the handful of rail lines in Fort Worth and Austin. As for the additional traffic in Dallas - no shit, sherlock - Dallas has **twice** the population density of Fort Worth. Abilene has great traffic. Why? Because nobody wants to fucking live in Abilene, so there aren't many cars. \n\n**TL:DR:** God dammit, why does Fort Worth have to get so testy about people not going out of their fucking way to call it a special little snowflake? Fort Worthians' efforts to shout from the roof tops about how they are better than Dallas has made you look more pretentious than *Dallas.* Think about that for a minute. The suburbs close to Dallas are more or less identical to the suburbs of Fort Worth, both cities have their fair share of SMU/TCU frat boys all grown up running shit, and neither is a cultural mecca of the modern world. Just fucking let it go and be cool. \n\n/rant

Afghanistan during Soviet occupation...that was particularly egregious)...but pound for pound the U.S. doesn't PRESENTLY hold a candle in that arena compared to countries like Saudi Arabia's spread of Wahhabism or Iran's support of Shia militias and terrorist groups. \n\nI could be wrong. I'd be happy to look at sources that show otherwise. I have no doubt it occurs still, but I would seriously doubt that it would be considered one of the most pervasive spreaders of terrorism in the world. \n\n**Edit:** /u/trnkey74 brought up some good examples of the U.S. supporting groups that the U.S. would otherwise consider as terrorist groups. I had forgotten about the clandestine support of Ukranian militias. I still think that, given what I've read in *Ghost Wars* and other books documenting support of "freedom fighters" during the Cold War, that current support of such groups is lower than it has been in years past.

The article didn't say anything about Turkish officials threatening to terminate US access to Incirlik, only that a Turkish newspaper published an article proposing to do so.\n\n#Sources that show Turkey's ACTUAL government officials have flirted with closing the US's access to Incirlik:\n\n - [August, 2016 report quoting the Turkish Prime Minister suggesting that Turkey might allow Russia to have access to the Incirlik air base, which would be almost as bad.](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/08/23/turkey-raises-possibility-of-opening-incirlik-air-base-to-russia.html)\n - [January, 2017 report citing Turkish officials, including Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu, actively considering shutting down US's access to the Incirlik airbase.](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/01/05/Turkey-says-it-may-shut-off-US-access-to-Incirlik-Air-Base/8961483626338/) The same article cites Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin saying that it is Turkey's sovereign right to shut off access to Incirlik to the U.S. The fact that it's even being discussed makes it seem like more than mere sensationalism from the Turkish press. \n - [February, 2017 article citing quotes from Seref Malkoc, the chief adviser to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan, saying that Turkey could act if the U.S. does not change its stance against the Kurds](http://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-turkey-unlikely-to-follow-through-on-threat-to-close-coalition-airbase/3203689.html). It also cites a "Top Turkish official" saying that Ankara may consider closing Incirlik, but it's not clear whether that official is Malkoc or someone else. \n - [July, 2016 article citing an *actual* closure of the Incirlik for U.S. use due to the coup attempt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/isis-airstrike-turkey-airspace-us-air-force). While that might seem unrelated, I think it's telling that the U.S., one of Turkey's allegedly strongest allies, wasn't trusted during the coup attempt. That shows the poor state of the geopolitical relations (and present level of trust) between the two countries at the very least. \n - [Jan, 2017 article from military.com citing Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik saying that the U.S.'s denial of air support for the Turskish military is "leading to serious disappointment in Turkish public opinion" and "is leading to questions over Incirlik."](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/01/04/turkey-hints-shuttering-incirlik-us-air-operations.html)\n\n**Conclusion:** Shuttering access to Incirlik isn't some new, off-the-wall threat made up by a crazy journalist. It's a threat that Turkish officials have used many times over the last few years as a bargaining chip and as a show of power against the United States. It's not a sensationalist story at this point - it's business as usual as of late.

No kidding. I personally would love to see Kurdistan become a reality, especially if they end up being a U.S. ally...but you risk a proxy war of epic proportions by trying to unilaterally carve it out of Syria.

I agree that the idea of the U.S. supporting "moderates" in Syria is a misnomer. You're right about that. The groups who have received support are definitely religiously motivated, and not in a benevolent or nonviolent way. \n\nI would argue that it's a question of degree, however. The U.S. drug its feet on supporting Syrian rebels because the Obama administration was very wary of creating another [Mujahideen blunder like the U.S. did in Afghanistan during the 70s and 80s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone). Ultimately, the **amount** of support given by the Obama administration to the Syrian rebels/anti-government-terrorists *pales* in comparison to the aforementioned Mujahideen debacles.  \n\n**Edit:** I'll concede that I downplayed the United States' support of terrorist groups too much and will edit my post accordingly. Good contribution. I still think that, at least in the middle east, that the degree of support has been much less than it was during previous eras of American history.

We'd love to. Texas used to have wolves, but they were eradicated by us (hunters). Their eradication has created an ecological problem for us. The problem is that concerned citizens freak out whenever Texas wildlife agencies suggest reintroducing wolves to our ecosystem, which has been suggested on and off since the 1970s. \n\n>Why we need wolves in Big Bend National Park. Releasing wolves in Texas will not be an easier sell than it was in New Mexico and Arizona. Still, there are many reasons why wolves should be released in Texas, and especially in Big Bend country. The first reason is that wolves belong in the Lone Star State. They are part of the natural heritage of Texas, and should be returned to their rightful place. The goal is also achievable and beneficial. Big Bend National Park, at more than 800,000 acres, provides good habitat for wolves. Having them in the park would address out-of-balance populations of mule deer, javelina and feral donkeys. Additionally, they would help stem feral hogs that have recently appeared in the northern part of the park. Having wolves in Big Bend National Park would enhance the experience of visitors, whether or not they see wolves.  Knowing they are there would add to the visit, and hearing them would be a terrific memory!  Another reason to reintroduce wolves in the park would be that, with time, another secure, self-supporting population could be established. If enough of these sites can be created, the status of this highly endangered animal could be moved away from the abyss of extinction.\n\n[Source](http://mexicanwolves.org/index.php/news/821/51/A-history-of-wolves-in-Texas-From-native-top-predators-to-a-fading-memory).
Did hat say grass cutting sword?
**Submission Statement:** Turkey has reiterated its previous threat to close the Incirlik airbase to the United States if the United States does not cease its support of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). The latter is a large force in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which plans on launching an assault on the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa. Closing Incirlik would force the U.S. to use alternative airbases, whether by land or sea, for its Syrian air support missions. All of the likely alternatives will be expensive and/or present a host of other problems. \n\nTurkey has historically been the strongest NATO ally in the middle east, which has always complicated US and NATO relations with perhaps the world's largest group of people who currently do not possess their own nation: the Kurds. Turkey has a large minority population of Kurds, and historically the Turkish government and Kurdish groups have been at odds with one another over government persecution, rebellious/terrorist acts, and the question of Kurdish autonomy. Turkey strongly opposes the creation of a Kurdish nation state near its border because of fears that it would lead to a reemergence of separatist violence from Kurdish rebel groups in Turkey. \n\nThe Kurds have been far and away the most effective "boots on the ground" for the U.S. in its fight against ISIS, both in Iraq and Syria. President Trump and the United States will have to walk a very fine line in order to keep the Turkish government and the various Kurdish groups happy, not to mention keeping the latter groups well supplied and well armed in the collective fight against ISIS. \n\nLastly, it should also be noted that a U.S. loss of access to the Turkish Incirlik airbase would be seen as a huge gain for Russia, who is hoping that the end result of the current Syrian conflict will be Russia gaining more soft power and influence throughout the region, including in Turkey, and specifically at the expense of the United States.

Interesting. Are deer populations threatened in Washington? Or is this just normal business as usual for the area?\n\nI live in Central Texas. We actually have a deer *over*population problem, which is a problem for farmers (eating crops) and hunters (less food available for the increased quantity of deer, which makes for smaller deer). Killing coyotes here thus isn't really a good thing for hunting overall.

**A few things for you to ponder since you seem interested in the founding  of Kurdistan:**\n\n - **A pseudo-Kurdistan already exists** - The U.S. invasion of Iraq resulted in the U.S. forcing the new Iraqi government to consent to the creation of an autonomous Kurdish state within Iraq, known as [Iraqi Kurdistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan). It is the only autonomous region in Iraq, and it's basically a country in all but name. Many saw its creation as the U.S. fulfilling its long held but clandestine promises to the Kurds to help them achieve independence. Those promises date back to *at least* 1991. \n - **Iraqi Kurdistan has since grown larger** - 2014 saw Iraqi Kurdistan grow even larger, if not necessarily officially, because Kurdish troops retook disputed Iraqi lands back from ISIS, occupying the areas with troops, and have made it clear that they intend to keep those areas as part of Iraq Kurdistan. It's anyone's guess whether the Kurds will cede that territory back to the rest of Iraq in the future. It's unlikely they will do so. \n - **The "Kurds" are not a united group and are instead made up of different groups with varying and sometimes conflicting objectives and goals** - Barzani is the leader of Iraqi Kurdistan, but he is not seen as a leader for all Kurdish groups. Differing Kurdish groups in different regions have different ideas about how to create Kurdistan, whether Kurdistan should even be the end goal, and who they want in power. President Barzani actually suspended all democratic institutions as of July 2016 in Iraqi Kurdistan, which is hopefully temporary (a perhaps naive hope). \n - **Another autonomous "Kurdistan" has been de facto carved out of Syria, but that might not last** - [Rojava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava) is a Kurdish region of Syria that is also now a self-governing autonomous nation of sorts, at least for the time being. In contrast to Iraqi Kurdistan, Rojava arguably contains a higher percentage of non-Kurdish citizens, though, and it remains to be seen whether the Syrian government will allow the area to be the Syrian equivalent of Iraqi Kurdistan, i.e. an autonomous state, or whether Syria will eventually wage war against the area to bring it fully under Syrian control, both in name and in function. The YPG is the main Kurdish fighting force in Rojava, and it's the YPG who Turkey doesn't want the U.S. to support. \n - **The conditions that allowed for Kurdish independence within Iraq and Syria don't exist within Iran and Turkey, and are unlikely to exist in the foreseeable future either** - Iraqi Kurdistan and Rojava were de facto carved out of chaos and power vacuums (US-Iraq War, Syrian civil war), and it's unclear whether Rojava will remain an autonomous Kurdish region. In contrast, Turkey and Iran are huge regional powers that, barring unforeseen changes of cataclysmic proportions, won't be having any such similar chaotic conditions that would allow the Kurds therein the chance to obtain greater autonomy. Turkey and Iran each have a much larger population and military than Syria or Iraq did, and Turkey and Iran are both ruled by majority groups whereas Iraq was ruled by minority Sunni regime(s) and Syria was/is ruled by minority Alawite regimes. Iran and Turkey are also much, much larger than Iraq in Syria in terms of population and in terms of their respective militaries. \n\n**TL;DR:** An independent Kurdistan already exists in the forms of Iraqi Kurdistan (official, stable) and Rojava (unofficial, much less stable) in Syria.

Clubbing is the most humane way of killing seals as the club breaks the skull and kill the seal almost instantly if done correctly. The animal doesn't feel pain once the brain has been crushed. Using a gun would be causing more pain as the animal would have to bleed to death. \nIt looks barbaric because of swinging a club to an animal isn't quite as appealing as a gun shot from a distance but the result is a death that takes seconds instead of minutes or hours. \n\nIn several, if not all, parts of the world baby seal hunting is illegal and hunters only go for the adult males. In Canada there is over population of seal and hunting is controlled and regulated by the government. \n

The real estate market in Montreal is more about duplex and triplex apartment building than high rise condo building and single homes. This makes the real estate less prone to fluctuation because owners have to rent out units and have to deal with rental property, this drives off a lot of potential buyers. \n\nAlso, the suburbs still have vast amount of land available to develop cheap condo complex. Developer can purchase land at a bargain and sell units with a high profit margin even if the price per unit remain around $200k.\n\n

I don't think the hate comes from the popularity of hating them. I personally think it comes from their inability to evolve with the market and the availability of better alternative. Their coffee has been sub par for years but they were pretty much the only chain on the market until 10 or 15 years ago when starbucks started expanding aggressively and McDonald's started offering a far better coffee. They simply let their own shit become the worst offering on the market and they try to push changes but it was mostly too little too late. \n\nSo yeah they are shit because they rely on their popularity to stay the same or push pale copy of competitor's product as a reaction to market trends
Depends on the pension plan and your goals when you retire. I have a public service pension I contribute to but it maxes out at 70% of the average of the best five years salary prior to retirement. So I contribute a little to an rrsp to make up the 30% difference. That way I'm ensuring I'll have the same if not a better standard of living when I retire while reducing my tax burden now. \n\nI also reinvest any tax return into my rrsp since it's essentially like free investment money I get back from the government\n\nYou are right though. With a pension the usefulness of rrsp is kind of limited and can make things far worst fiscally if not careful. It really depends of your own situation and the cost benefit of contributing. 
For those interested the Government of Canada has a retirement income calculator https://srv111.services.gc.ca/generalinformation/index/ \n\nIt gives a general idea of income benefits from government program such as CPP OAS and retirement savings and income such as pension RRSPS and TFSA

You know that you have to include the car payment as a taxable benefit. Unless they provide an allowance for business expense (aka you pay upfront and they repay you after) \n\nif they are paying for the car and you use it for personal use, you will need to include it as income because it is a taxable benefit. Same thing for travel expenses, if you book extra days for personal use and your employer pays for it they might be considered a taxable benefit. \n\nTo be sure contact an accountant to make sure everything you get is declared properly otherwise if CRA audits you and find out you might be liable for a huge penalty. 
Can you give more details on the asset purchased and the use of this asset in your business. \n\nHere is a list from the CRA of eligible business expenses and their deductibility http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/slprtnr/bsnssxpnss/menu-eng.html

Real estate is not an investment, it's a long term asset. It depreciate and requires upkeep and repair work to maintain value. Even renting it doesn't guarantee a steady income, and it creates a ton of liabilities and expenses. 
Yeah I was aware of this but it only works on windows 8 and 10 so I left it out
it's okay though, I'm better now that I don't take it anymore. my doctor is still trying to figure out what medication works for me. Citalopram sort of work but I'm mostly just meh all the time

I agree with you. Canada needs better trading partner in the wake of US protectionism.

Now is time for Canada to go back to negotiation with TPP member countries and reach trade agreements with them. This will inevitably be better off for Canada's economy in the long run

There are no "best" program in college. Every program can lead to a decent career if you are talented and have strong interest in the field you are studying. Go with what your interest and strengths are.  \n\nIf you are looking only at the potential return on investment, engineering and applied science are probably the "best". However most B.Sc programs are incredibly competitive to get into and you need above average marks in math and science to get in.\n\nOther field you might want to consider are business, law, statistics and data science, computer science, actuarial science. Each of those field are sought for in the job market and can lead to amazing careers in industries and government. \n\nA good rule of thumb for college is, if it's hard to get in, stay in and graduate, the better your income and job security will be. \n

You know they only kill full grown adult male right. Its illegal in most countries to kill baby seals and most of the hunt is done as a population control as they eat too many fishes and are depleting their food sources. \n\nSo killing them is far better than having them go into starvation. \n\nFor the hakapik (club), it's actually the fastest and most humane way to kill seals as it kills almost instantly and the nervous system is basically disconnected after the first blow so the animal doesn't feel much pain.

If the laptop has other uses than strictly for business purpose you wouldnt be able to claim it as a business expense unless you declare the personal use as an employment benefit . The transfer of the asset to the business could also be contested if CRA finds out that the use is not only for the purpose of the business. In my opinion its not worth the risk given the very low tax benefit it would create.
They are probably not including individuals in their estimates. Also, on tax fairness they are talking about money lost to the shadow economy which might include money that is used for criminal activity that isn't reported for tax purpose.
I got Wellbutrin XL added to Citalopram in the past and I didn't react well to it. I got way worst and had to take sick leave from work because of the side effects and in the end my doctor discontinued the Wellbutrin. I read about it a lot at the time and there is good results from clinical trial for a combo of SSRIs and Wellbutrin and most people get a positive effect from that combo.

Your situation seems to be quite complex. I would suggest you to talk to an accountant specialized in taxes who has a knowledge of the US tax code to avoid any trouble.\n\nIn Canada, the year you exercise your option you must include the difference between the fair value of the stocks acquired and the cost of shares. Then the increase in Net income for tax purposes will be offset by 50% under ITA110(1) deduction. \n\nFor example: you have option to purchase 1000 stocks of xyz .inc at a price of 25$. At the time you exercise your option the fair value of the stock was 50$. Your net income for tax purposes would increase by 25,000$ ((50-25)*1000) then you would apply the deduction from ITA110(1) for 1/2 of 25,000$, this will result in an increase in taxable income of 12500$. \n\nWhen you dispose of the stocks in the future you will realized the capital gains from the fair value of the stocks at the time of acquisition.\n

They might be talking about sales tax which makes sense since the product or service you are providing is done/sold in quebec.\n\nAs per my previous post your income from this would be business income and it is filed in the province of residency. Bring this up to an accountant to be sure though. 
From the article : \n>Angela Swick, a registered nurse with the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit, who was administering vaccines at Sullivan’s high school on the day of the incident, testified he visited the clinic three times.\n>\n>During his first visit to the clinic, Swick testified he asked for the inserts included in each vaccine box. Students were receiving vaccines for polio, diphtheria and other diseases that day, Swick said.\n>\n>“But his tone and manner was abrupt and left us with an unsettled feeling,” Swick said. “He said something like ‘I hope you’re letting these students know these vaccines can cause death.’ I remember feeling threatened.”\n\nHe's not lying when he says they can cause death but he's making it sound far more threatening than it needs to be. Misrepresentation of a fact (in this case the likelihood of dying from vaccine) knowing that the fact is misrepresented and that as a result of this misrepresentation, harm is done to others (teenagers and medical professional feeling threatened by the dumbass), this is the technical definition of a lie. \n\nI hope this dumbshit get sued by all the parents and nurses.  \n\n
It would be considered either employment income or business income depending on your status with the "employer". If it's employment income you should receive a T4. If the company consider you as a subcontractor you would report the income as business income. In the later case you would be able to deduct certain expenses but it would open some liabilities. Before you do anything clarify your status with the company, keep all your receipt and track your car usage when you are working. Ask an accountant to do your taxes if you are not sure (do not go to H&R block with this even if it is cheaper)
My best girl friend in college died from medical complications 10 years ago and I have not recovered from it. She was my closest friend at school and I have to admit that I had a crush on her. Her death really affected me, went through depression for a while and dropped out of school the semester after her death. 
Do you have another source of this because the link you provided is sketchy AF and looks like fake news 
He did lie as he misrepresented the risk of an adverse reaction to vaccine. It's one thing of pointing that adverse effect may occur in 1 out of 100000. It's another of being belligerent and having a threatening teenagers that they will die if they get vaccinated in front of a vaccination clinic inside a school. Bonus point for this dipshit being a science teacher.
Call your employer and ask him to amend the ROE. If he filed it electronically it should take about 5 minutes to correct it. If he filed on triplicate paper form, you can ask for a copy of the amended ROE to bring to Service Canada while your employer mails it to them. 
I got an annual pass last spring to go hike in the nearest parks. I try to go at least 2 - 3 times a month on the weekend.

Based on your comments it sounds like you are self-employed in which case your income from your contract in Quebec would not be considered employment income but business income.

In Black Jack there are ways of counting the cards to skew the odds of the dealer going over 21 in your favor. This is probably the only game where you can actually use mathematics and statistical model to give you an edge over the dealer.\n\nThe simple count method will give you away by your betting pattern since there is a high chance you'll end up betting high when you have an edge over the dealer and be more conservative when the cards are against you.\n\nThe MIT method of counting is more subtle but also require more people and more sophisticated models to give you an edge over the casino. In this case the real tip-off is your winning streak.\n\nIn the end the casino may or may not know if you are actually cheating but if they see you win for a while they might either ask you to leave politely or they might want to distract you from the game. There is no law preventing you from using statistics to win at the casino but the casino can ban you from entering their premises and they will enforce it and if you go again they will charge you with trespass.

What makes you think we couldn't have kept Budaj as a backup for next to nothing?  Nearly every year the Kings sacrifice picks and prospects for high profile guys that are almost guaranteed to leave at the end of the season.  Bishop is a Vezina caliber goal tender but so is Quick.  I think Budaj would have been just fine as Quick's back up for the rest of the season and we probably could have obtained a more powerful point scorer instead of trading for an expensive super goalie who will likely only play for a few months.

Attacking the speaker doesn't provide any counter point to my argument.  Therefore you have already lost the argument, and yet your head is still buried so far up your ass that you can't even see that.  
Lizzy, after Elizabeth Warren. 
Thank you! Love your sauces.  
Thanks dude.  How much room will I need if I plant like 40 seeds when it comes time to transition them into larger pots?  I'm a bit tight on space and am thinking maybe I should only try to grow 10 or so total.  
Should crosspost to /r/IdiotsFightingThings. 
 That was a great read actually!  I love Alex Chilton and I agree that Marshall transcends the genre.  This is the first track from his 1982 album and I can't get it out of my head. 
This is why the immigration debate is more  complicated than "hurr durr deport the imgrents!" 
The scheduling system has no basis in science or actual danger.  It was created to punish hippies and minorities who used pot and psychedelics.  Big pharma would never allow actually dangerous and addictive drugs like oxycontin to be identified as schedule I.  
Governments allow third party companies to use robots to auto-buy the tickets before anyone can purchase them.  They could easily pass laws stopping this.  They could also regulate things like "other fees" where TicketSlave adds on random $15 fees for no reason.  
What other seeds should I buy other than fataliis as a first time grower? Anything that grows particularly easily and has good flavor? Preferably hot?\n

Donald Trump cannot shit anymore. 
That is the song that turned me on to him.  Came up on Spotify Discover Weekly and I loved it.  I actually just ended up liking the above song better.  I've been listening to live versions of older songs lately just to get the vibe of what people were like in person.  
How much will it cost Los Angeles if it runs out of water?  How much does a desalinization plant cost to build and then run every year?  We literally take all of our rain water and run it directly into the ocean.  It's beyond idiotic. 
I think Spy was better than any of the Paul Blart movies. 
How many poor leadership choices does he have to make before we can all agree he is a terrible choice for President? 
Trump is a moron and you know it. 
I helped organize a measure s forum on behalf of mid city West community council. You can come and hear from both sides. It's also free. Please help me spread the word.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/384486445254217/?ti=as

> Trump has never said anything hateful towards ethnic groups at all. \n\nWhat? \n\n[Mexico only sends us its rapists.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/?utm_term=.4be2593f4a13)\n\n[What about the time Trump took a shit on a Muslim Gold Star family by implying that the Muslim mother of a fallen soldier didn't speak because "maybe she wasn't allowed to speak"?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83)\n\nOr that time Trump insinuated that the judge in his Trump University trial couldn't be impartial because he's Mexican?\n\nEven Paul Ryan thinks that was racist: “Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a reaction to Trump’s comments.\n\nPeople like you live in this bubble of unreality where you only hear what you want to hear from Trump. Meanwhile, the rest of the country and the world has to deal with his ineptitude at literally every level of leadership, his fear mongering, and his divisive language meant to intimidate and hurt minorities, immigrants, women, and basically everyone who isn't a white, heterosexual Christian.  \n\nYou're absolutely fucking deluded to think he hasn't made racist statements and its because of people like you that our country is going into the shitter for the next 4 to 8 years.  
Looks like champagne. 
I was about to say, man are some babies ugly...
My guess is that he'll blame either Hillary Clinton or Obama.  
Can you elaborate on what you mean?
How long will it take for Los Angeles to realize that it needs to build reservoirs that capture rain instead of just funneling it all out to the ocean? The LA River is designed to just dump rainwater out in the ocean and instead we could be using that water to keep us wet in the long drought years between rainy seasons.  
Fox News seems like an anti-feature. How much do I pay to not get it?
OK, thanks. I'll make some calls. 
How much do you relate to [this article?](http://www.theonion.com/article/libertarian-reluctantly-calls-fire-department-4651)
I would watch this version.  
What did it cost for all of the parts and set up?
>maybe DL is taking the now or never approach.\n\nGiven the insanity of the Bishop trade, I'd say this is obvious. 
I'd rather have Seguin. 
We stand for environmentally sustainable practices, curbing global warming, allowing the free expression of religion, sexuality, and other personal traits that do not harm others. We are for legalization and regulation of vice to eliminate the strength of the black market and ending human trafficking. We are against unnecessary wars and against corruption. 
This bullshit was like a fever in the Bush days.  
Pulled the trigger on that Char Man Caribbean, some Fatalii puree, and the 708 7 pot citrus.  I seem to be polishing off every fatalii sauce I've bought from your shop (the gold coast and the sinclair's).  
When DT leans in to kiss Melania. 
What is a rapid router? Ignorant person here who just bought some fatalii seeds, lives in an apartment and has no idea how to grow pepper plants. 
I think Melissa McCarthy is genuinely hilarious.  She does physical humor well in a way that many people haven't pulled off since Robin Williams, Chris Farley, or Jim Carrey. She also isn't afraid to make fun of herself. 
Republicans never had any principles. They just want to push their hard right religious agenda and punish those who disagree with them. Marijuana laws existed in the first place to punish and harass Mexicans, African Americans and members of the counter culture.

How were you able to locate that from a cropped photo? 
That's because they are paid to post supportive articles about him. 
How is the fatalii sauce? Have it in the cart at Heat Hot Sauce. 
I've heard people say that the Kings played this season even more defensively than usual to protect Budaj, implying they had less faith in his ability to goaltend.  That being said, Kopi is not the same guy he usually is and it remains to be seen whether a boost from Bishop and Iginla can change things up enough to see him start scoring again.

Any working class person who thought a billionaire like Trump was going to help them is dumber than shit. He has a history of ripping people off and engaging in shady business practices. 
Impeach this idiot NOW. 
Have they finally located the outer edge of Trump's ego? 
Seeing the rise in anti-semitism (which means hatred of both Muslims and Jews) is really shocking and ugly.  Not sure why the dumbass, redneck piles of shit that voted for Trump can't distinguish between American Muslims and Jews vs. ISIS terrorists.  
Classy tribute.  
Ok Rick Perry. 
I can't imagine having a job where I have to deal with total assholes like that on a daily basis.  Cops have the scariest job imaginable.

Which one of them is Gabby? Doesn't seem to be his wife or daughter's name. 
My Martin has a hairline crack on its front. It's barely noticeable except in bright light. I want to get it repaired and wondered if I should take a stab at doing it myself or if I should just get it professionally done. If I get it professionally repaired, what's a fair price to pay?
In the first few days after birth, it's likely that if you try to breastfeed your baby, you won't produce enough milk. It takes time to transition from the initial colostrum to milk. You may need to supplement with formula for a few days in between. Pay attention to whether or not your baby is actually getting fed. 
Is that Key or Peele?  Also, does that mean the other guy is going to play the Predator? 
Alex Jones is a fucking disgrace to America. 
Say it with me: these people are traitors. 
Fair point.  
From where?
This happened after we had left the hospital.  I'd say it took a good week before my wife's milk came in fully, and there were a few days inbetween when the colostrum stopped and before the milk production really ramped up enough to feed the baby.  Our baby was on my wife's breast for hours and hours straight but she wasn't yet producing enough milk.  I think this is a serious issue because new parents have no idea whether or not they are producing enough milk for the baby and they need to realize that sometimes there is a gap between the end of the colostrum and beginning of breast milk production where the baby needs to be fed from another source.  
Yet they eat rotten shark. I wouldn't trust this guy to have functioning taste buds. 
Oh my fucking god. Trump is a nationwide disaster. 
Totally disagree. My wife kept trying to breastfeed our baby and she kept crying for nearly a day. Only then did we realize she wasn't producing enough milk yet. We felt bad using formula but it's more important for her to be fed than to rely solely on breast milk. I also read about a baby who died recently because the parents only tried breastfeeding and not enough milk was produced in that first week. It's a dangerous issue and people need to understand that it can happen. 
I got about tree fiddy.  
That was a long ass patch cable.  
While I agree with you, there is no comparison between a Clinton presidency and a Trump presidency. Trump is exponentially less qualified and mode dangerous by any measure.

Google "contact dermititis." It could be an allergic reaction from coming into skin contact with a certain allergen.
Jesus dude.  I am a member of a couple kennel clubs and have known multiple breeders and have a few under our belt.  Our kennel runs at a net loss.  Between the DNA, OFA, eyes, heart checks.  Plus food, vet bills even at a 1000$ a dog we lose money.  We do it because we love the breed.  We show, do field trials, agility, dick diving, obedience.  There is a difference between a puppy mill and a breeder and you can tell within five minutes on the property.  We just had a litter around Christmas we had to keep the puppies till ten weeks because of all the Christmas puppy buyers.  Sorry you worked in a shelter and seen then worst but there is a different side too.  
You must have missed the GW presidency.  This is the standard MO for them attack threaten to impeach the other guy.  Then switch to forced lock step when their guy is in.  Shit remember the Dixie chicks?  Sad really.
We should do that what should we call it.  Maybe "make health care affordable act" no that is to long. Any ideas?
Well we could buy the folders from office depot for a couple cents or go through the supply chain and pay a couple bucks.  Personally I always just ran out and grabbed what I needed and hoped supply would back fill me.  
That is my point the entire thing sounds fishy.
Very poor school systems, home schooling, private schooling, the ability to protect anything you say because of "freedom".  Having the president condone the hatred of a entire religion on air then declare war on an ism.  The fact said president was never held responsible for knowingly lying to the entire nation and half the population to start a war daddy wanted to finish. is OK with that, but some how an attack in an embassy is the biggest issue of the day.   A person in smart people are dumb.
Freedom of religion goes both ways.  Protects the right of citizens to worship who ever and what ever that want.  And hear is the kicker it protest every one else from that person's religion.  So if you religion is to sacrifice babies on every 3rd Tuesday that has a full moon.  You can not do that you are effecting the rights of others in that practice.  And casting laws that effect everyone based off a religious text does effect every one thus is illegal.  Weather or not any "harm" comes from that.  Religious creep is a very real problem in parts of the US.  Being illegal to purchase alcohol on Sunday is the top one to come to mind.  But when the majority of the population is of that religion and sees nothing wrong with that the checks and balances in place break down.  Sorry on phone and I am sure this reads like a five year old wrote it.
From my last couple of interviews they would want it for 12/HR no benefits too
I get that at a micro scale.  But we have an illusion of choice now.  The food we buy? Hand full of companies. The TV we watch, the cars we buy the stores we shop in are all shells owned by bigger companies who, in turn, are owned by even bigger companies.  These monoliths will run something at a loss to drive out any upstarts / mom and pop companies.  Theses same large corporations write the very laws that the small business owners struggle to over come because they can afford it.  What was once am easy start a company in your garage is now a up hill battle the very very few that make it and actually have a million do not want more red tape the want less.  I get that.  They are not the problem it is not millionaire running us into the ground.  It is multi Billionaires.  I keep hearing the 1% the one percent have not done shit but work thief asses off. It is the .0001% that is Fucking us over.  The message is not wrong just not pointed at the wrote group of people.  Yet here we are still fighting each other while they write another check for a 50k to get another puppet into cabinet.  That is nothing to these people it is like us spending a quarter dollar.  The simple scale of saying multiple billions is lost on a lot of people.  And the number of people who have that much capitol is so laughable small it should make every single one of us sick.  But we will continue to point fingers at the guy making 100k a year or the guy who talks funny and cuts our lawn.  We are being played and frankly they are so good at it we can not blame them for continuing to play us. \n\n\nEdit: holy shit rant sorry dude. \n
But still bring evergreens into the house and pay homage to a bunny that lays eggs....

Lol tax refund.  I get back very little at the end of the year.  But I agree with you.  I was raised on benefits grew up sort ass poor.  And have no problem getting bent over the rail at the end of the year.  Again we are doing exactly what the want.  We are fighting each other and not realizing the game is rigged.  As long as we keep the middle class blaming the lower class we all loose.
Mine was six years.  Pretty standard for Tech rates.  You will be in school at least a year.
Did not know I was misleading saying that he made money off of filling bankruptcy.  If I was I am sorry.  Yes the current laws in place are designed to do this very thing. Yes people / companies do it regularly. And yes I still do not understand how a guy / company that uses these laws for financial gain is Harold a champion by a party that scream personal responsibility and fiscal responsibility.  Yes it is legal but I do not find it moral.  Nor do I think electing some one to the office of presidency that made his money using these laws is a good idea.  But I am sorry for misleading.
I am curious what do you think the policy should have been? 
24 hour news channels.  Hell the is the ID channel all it is is crimes.  No wonder
Well we have been in what some would describe as a religious war for what 16 years now?  Even when Bush was president he made speeches that could have been taken as the Christian God versus the Muslim God.  
What, besides open borders and free trade, was in those?  To my knowledge she had always been for those.
Thanks she is here safe and sound in the NICU I will try and post pics in the morning I am exhausted.  But I have baby and mamma both safe and sound that is all I can ask for.
This topic today has caused me to question any advice I get from this sub.  I do not know why you are being downvoted.  All I know is at 34 years old, all my friends who received corporal punishment are living successful lives with families and kids and a career.  The ones who were not usually never made it out of highschool.  Are hooked on drugs and have a job but no future.  Our job as parents is to teach our children to be contributing members of society.  My coworker said it best I am not raising my girl I am raising someone's wife.  Can spanking go to far hell yes.  Should there be punishment for actions Fuck yes.  Will society take my little girl aside and explain why what she is doing wrong? No the will kick her in the teeth and then piss on her while she is on the ground.  There is a happy medium here we should be discussing as adults.  Instead we are SJW this shit and downvoting anything that does not conform to what we have read on the internet.  But at the end of the day I am the parent of my child.  I will do what I think is best to give her the skill set to kick ass and take names as an adult.  How I do that is my business.  This sub used to be where I lurked to get ideas from other parents on how to deal with situations.  Now after a few of these topics came down the pipe and we regressed in the hivemind I am re-evaluating everything.  How many times has my advice I have taking from this sub tainted by SJWs?  Lucky for me a lot of my friends had kids in their early twenties this means their kids are now teenagers.  I will not get into the differences I see from the SJW kids and the kids raised like I was.  But the kids raised like I was have a huge head start already on life lessons and I have a feeling that gap is going to be widening.  At the end of the day though it is our choice as parents not this subs choice.  \n\n\nEdit: yes let the hate flow through you.
It did last time the trick is to cook the books until the next guy. \n\nEdit : adding /s for reasons

The race to the pine tree is getting old.  So many different types of beers and they all have to compete with the IPAs to get shelf space.  Lucky for me Colorado has some variety for your palette.

P , MP, EP.  Depends on your command how many of each they can give.  With an un-observed evil you will be a P but you will already have PNA points for the next test.
I have been voting D for close to 20 years now.  The rabid anti gun rhetoric is what causes me to always look at voting R in every election.  If the Rs but up any one but trump against Hilary this year I would have likely voted for them and not her just based of her gun stance.  We are real we exist and we are in far greater numbers than you think.  To win a 50 state strategy you have to get the rural vote.  People in rural districts own guns in very large numbers.  You go after that right you push them away.  I do not want an assault rifle.  But I do know the difference between a semi automatic rifle and an assault rifle.  And trying to pass legislation on the former because it looks tactic-cool is scaring the shit out people who just want to own a semi automatic rifle, because the language can and will be applied to all guns.  Assault rifles are already extremely hard to get and not with out some serious paperwork.  And stop calling an AR-15 an assault rifle you are thinking of the M-4.\n\nEdit: I guess this is not a discussion of how to win voters. looks at title wait yes it is.  
I wonder if the bridge is doing something to covert the cPCI to PCIe then.  I can see all the cards as individual cards in VMware but am forced to only allocate the entire bridge T-bone VM\n
We can start by stop trying to classify a AR-15 as an assault rifle.  It is not and looking scary does not change the fact that it is a semi automatic rifle not an assault rifle.  We already have huge amounts of red tape to purchase assault rifles in place.  Any legislation that will effect AR-15 sells will effect any person purchasing a deer rifle too.  
I see this a lot.  What has Obama done to effect your right to own a firearm.  I know if lifted the ban on carrying in parks.  I can not remember anything else.
IMO we need to start looking at keeping trump out of the white house.  I do not like Hilary as much as the next guy.  But Trump scares me.  The problem will be keeping the younger voters motivated enough to vote.  If we do that we have a shot of keeping him out.  We all start saying Bernie or bust we just handed him the election.  
ET1?
Colon springs checking in.  And as you can guess very pro trump.  One guy has manikins dressed up with trump will save us jail Hillary in a jail cell.  But to be fair this entire town is very red.
Still waiting for someone to mention the Bankruptcies maybe holding the Ace up the sleeve in case he wins the nomination?
looking into the cards now but the bus used is [Link](http://www.avagotech.com/products/pcie-switches-bridges/usb-pci/io-accelerators/pci9656) All address coming from this bus (04:00.0) fall under 05:0#.0 the end device is [link](http://embedded-computing.com/products/id/?34756) pretty old.  not sure if the PMs would be willing to look into Xen vice VMware.  We might evaluate changing to another RF card after this P2V effort. Thnl you so much for your help nice to get educated rather than ridiculed. 
Wolverine origins would like a word.
So the laws are working as they were designed.  Unfortunately the people who write these laws, the media that most of the voters listen to, and thus the voters themselves will see this as a win.  Sickening but this is where we are today do to not giving a crap about who we vote for.  Now it is nigh impossible to change it.  I can not say enough this crap needs to be blasted as the very reason your vote matters. 
I think my point was missed.  The product is people (users or prisoners) 
Also if I had a choice of raiding grandma's grow op or the guy slinging PCP.  I know who I would choose.  Find 50 plants report shows 40.  You and your buddies split the electronica and appliances department sells the house at auction.  And if you are lucky you get to use the new MRAP.  
That is my point.  What they got the maintenance manual for a M4?  
Wow who would have thought a SJW would be an admin of this sub.  Just look at this comment section. 
Looks like the Fox News short bus found the comment section.
It is because they are told that the poor is the problem by the .001% 
Or worse Multiplayer centric with a 2 hour single player campaign with dead servers in 2 months....
Wow those comments are brutal.  Do people really have no idea how the budget is passed?  The difference between debt and deficit?  Is this what our nation has become?
He had a rally in Colorado Springs a little while ago and his VP is coming soon.  But Colorado Springs is a known religious right hold out.  
Yeah but if I said that then I would have to deal with the source? Questions.  I am on mobile and lazy so decided to punt it.
Depends on what you are selling.  War on drugs raised prices on drugs.  Increase prison population.  So the Cartels made more money, and law enforcement make more money.  Unless you thought it was for the general populace benefit..... That is not what this war or any war for that matter has ever been about.  If you have any financial interest in the war on drugs the last thing you do is want, is it to end.  Why do you think both the Cartels and the DEA both lobby to keep this money machine of a war going?  This is textbook capitalism if you are looking out from behind the right desk.
Then add dependants.  Always great to be in line at check out and the 4 people in front of you do not get ask for ID bit you in uniform get asked and it gets even more hilarious.  Especially hearing the conversations about welfare queens as they drag there 4 kids, aunts, grandma and friend through check out so they do not pay serious tax.  But that is a /r/military circle jerk and not this sub.
He lied about a blow job.  His popularity was on the rise because of it.  This is the exact opposite in my opinion.  But it is just that an opinion.
This is why we lose the debate before it starts.  Even at 100k you are not rich.  Well of yes.  Even wealthy maybe.  The people making money off these policies are rich but we never talk about them.  The people who make over ten times that who's money makes them more money faster than they can themselves make it.  So while you are fighting with the small business owners, Comcast passes more legislation to screw us all.  
Not really the definition for broadband is like 512k or something similar.  that being said I believe the argument was we do not have a monopoly you can get DSL or use your phone.  craziest thing was it worked. 
So by establishing say a market where people could go and buy insurance from a choice of providers?  You think that would work?
Trump looks a little rough tonight.  Hilary looks like she is riding the wave.  First question was a softball.  An neither is answering.  Just two sharks circling each other.
how many companies products can you shop for and compare while standing in one aisle in one store?  How many new cars can you compare while standing in one parking lot?
I doubt I am taking away from the lower class.  But your mind set is I am the enemy by making over a 100k.  Bit if being in IT in health care and making enough money that my wife can stay home and not work is attacking the lower class run with it.
I heard it today.  I was at a loss really. 
Those damn state lines
10 euros for this is really expected. Would've bought if it was half.. 
That was a press conference this is the debate.  What does he think will happen.  They are not going to be asked questions..... I do not think.  
Tried to explain this to people while I was in.  Aparently this is not scocialism because........ we are not russia..... you do not see very many people that are not GOP brainwashed robots on active duty.  Helps that every tv you walk by is Fox news or AFN which makes FOX look liberal.
I see this a lot what info came out from him that we did not already know.
Dude just give up all he is going to do is respond with "We pay above the median." Never realizing that everyone is trying to tell him that the Median is to low.  I have 20-30 emails a week for jobs all paying about 40-60% of my current salary.   He is trying to justify himself you can never win an argument against a person like that.
It formats the drive by writing all 1 and 0 repeatedly the more secure the more cycles
What is the difference between and AR-15 and a semi-automatic deer rifle that chambers a 5.56 round?  And how do you write legislation for it while not effecting the other? 
That is great for the younger tech literate population.  They practically live and breathe online.  The problem is how many of these people vote? Vote in the primaries?  You do not have to convince the population graduating college entering the workforce and realizing they are screwed.  They already love Bernie.  You have to convince the grandparents that may or may not even have social media.  Not to mention if they are literate in how to use it.  These people , the ones that actually vote in the primaries, were watching last night or this morning or reading their paper.  These voters only see the stump speech. Of course their are exceptions.  Hell my grandparents actually think Obama took the POTUS oath on the Koran because that is what their coffee circle tells them.  As much as I like Bernie he has no chance in the general unless every youth vote shows up.  Something that has never happened.  So as a liberal do I ride the dream down in flames or do I realize that with the SCOTUS seats up for grabs I should start playing chess and not checkers?
You can not blame them if all the know are people who let there dogs breed like bunnies, never take then to the vet, and when the female literally give up, dumps her.  You see these all the time on Craig's list selling pups for 200 to 500 a pop.  Pup that is the buyers fault.  We try and educate as much as we can but it is a hard up hill battle.  To add to a post else where if you do not get a folder of paperwork on the dog you buy guess where you are.  There should be medical certifications for bitch and sire, pedigrees for both, and the akc package should have full rights marked out.  After three litter we have never let a dog go with out a contract agreement that the buyer will fix the pet at an appropriate age.  And to get full right you are either in the 2k range or under contract of some sort of more than likely both.   It is crazy the stigmata we have where all breeders are in it for the money.  My alpha male probably has 10k invested in him and he is going to retire soon and probably made us 8k.  You do not get into breeding for the money.
That really doesn't align with his foreign policy where he was complaining about sanctions and drone strikes though.
Not to start some shit but, how that work out for us?  Did something need done? Damn straight.  And yes hindsight is 20/20.  But you can hardly call either war a success.  No WMDs were found.  The dude we were looking for was not even in the country we leveled.  Our largest ally in the region still has segments of its leadership funding the very thing we are trying to stop.  Maybe "pre-emptive decapitation strikes" we're not the best idea.  Don't get me wrong I did a lot of good while I was in.  But there are nights I stay up thinking of the shit that was not right no matter how you sugar coat it.  Let the down votes come.
He answered it in the only way he knows how.  In doing so told me all I need to know.
as /u/frogswithwings said; "May I direct your attention to this link? http://imgur.com/a/LQIsE and now that we can see for sure that it isn't innocent can we get back to correctly labeling EA a shit company and not call it circle jerking since they actually are shit?

We have a choice in that we can except the shit they pull over on peasants or we can wake the fuck up and say "This is bullshit.

ET pretty much translates to Everything tech.  as everyone is a push button e-4 no one advances.  watches are pretty easy and most of your day is either doing preventative maintenance or fixing operator issues.  every once in a while something will actually break and you grab the manual take your readings order bad part then up date your Chain of command every 15 minutes for three weeks until it gets in.  other than that pretty chill rate.\n
That much wage growth is a problem most of the country wishes they had at this point after decades of wage stagnation.
Doesn't matter what send think right now.  What matters is getting him through the primary and on the ticket.  Will never happen.  Who votes in the primaries?  The Rs had a chance last election to put him up.  If they did I would have voted for him vice Obama.  But I got the choice of giving him another 4 years or a dude with magic panties, favored corporations are people.  Wrote off 47 percent of the population .  Not much of a choice.  If it was a Ryan vs Obama race they would have had the house Senate POTUS and scotus.  That is a blank check.  This is coming from a heavily leaning socialist too.  Get a moderate to run you have a shot.  Moderate do not make it through the primaries. Anti poor, instants, Muslim's do.  Pro war, pro police state, pro jeebus do.  People willing to talk before pulling a gun not so much.  Polls do not have any bearing in who the committee puts up.  The good old boys (enter old white who have enough political pressure to make things happen here) do.  Lucky for the rest this means we will not likely see a TP rep make it through but that is not a good metric I am not a crazy as that guy so vote for me.

Why would you use a proprietary charger when most Electronics tend to use Micro USB.

I thought I would never say this but, yes. Compared to what I watched last night he would get my vote over most of what is being offered.  Someone going after a few third world countries does not hold a candle to people going after Iran/Russia.  That is not saying much though seems the GOP is too busy compiling with the fringe minority rather than going after the moderates.  I get it, if they go too far left then they run the risk of losing the stake holders in the primaries.  Just seems the last few election cycles they went so far right to get out of the primaries when they hit the open they had to play the hand they were dealt and were set up for failure.    I am an independent, I like my 2nd amendment but I like my “socialist” benefits as well.  I should not have to choose between the two. 
You would be surprised to hear, that to most Americans the rest of the world is white noise.  They do not know where south Dakota is on the map, much less New Zealand.

\n\nWhere Secret Arrests Were Standard Procedure\n\n\nKIERSTEN ESSENPREIS\n\nBy THE EDITORIAL BOARD\n\nDECEMBER 28, 2016\n\nFor a shocking glimpse of what’s been happening in the name of criminal justice in America, look no further than a Justice Department report last week on police behavior in Louisiana. Officers there have routinely arrested hundreds of citizens annually without probable cause, strip-searching them and denying them contact with their family and lawyers for days — all in an unconstitutional attempt to force cooperation with detectives who finally admitted they were operating on a mere “hunch” or “feeling.”\n\nThis wholesale violation of the Constitution’s protection against unlawful search and seizure by the police in Evangeline Parish, including in its largest city, Ville Platte, was standard procedure for putting pressure on citizens who the police thought might have information about crimes, according to the findings of a 20-month federal investigation. The report described as “staggering” the number of people who were “commonly detained for 72 hours or more” with no opportunity to contest their arrest, in what the police euphemistically termed “investigative holds.”\n\nThe sheriff’s office in Evangeline, with a population of 33,578, initiated over 200 such arrest-and-grilling sessions between 2012 and 2014. In Ville Platte, which has 7,303 residents, the local police department used the practice more than 700 times during the same years. The residents faced demands for information, the report said, “under threat of continued wrongful incarceration,” resulting in what may have been false confessions and improper convictions.\n\n“Literally anyone in Evangeline Parish or Ville Platte could be arrested and placed ‘on hold’ at any time,” the report found, noting the large African-American populations in Ville Platte (64 percent) and Evangeline (29 percent over all). The police ordered one woman to bring her young children with her to headquarters. They questioned her 5-year-old about the mother before releasing the children. The mother slept on the floor of a holding cell for three days before charges, later dropped, were even brought.\n\nWhile the nation has been exposed in recent years to police abuses involving the fatal shooting of citizens, particularly black Americans, the new report presents something no less insidious: dragnet interrogations routinely conducted below the radar as a supposed tool of criminal justice. The practice, which finally prompted local complaints to the federal government, was found to be habitual in the parish for as long as anyone could remember.\n\nReforms have since begun, a tribute to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section, which carried out the investigation and demanded wholesale changes. This bureau has done notable work during the Obama administration, investigating 25 law enforcement agencies and requiring and overseeing major reforms. To fully secure national justice, its work must continue. One big question in Washington now is whether President-elect Donald Trump and his choice for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, might ever commit themselves to this cause\n\n

What are the choices?  One side we have a billionaire (that is a b by they way), or a religious right fruit loop (at least we can be relieved we are not going to be dragged into where ever that was going).  The other side we have a socialist (with no real plan to pay for anything), or yet another war hawk (that has so many conspiracies against her that she is radioactive).  The united states is in serious trouble.  And all we can do as a country is point across the isle and say at least I am not that guy.  Instead of looking in the mirror and saying why is no one representing me?

I just think we need to stop classifying people into groups.  I agree and I vote democrat every cycle because I started off my life on those very systems as a kid.  But by roping is in with the rest we are adding to the problem.  They want us to fight each other while the real problem is stealing from both of us.  I think even 250k is to low.  A million a year those are the ass holes.

Those that come to mind are many of the truereddits, the atheism subreddits, neutralpolitics, and the science subreddits. These subreddits tend to have people come in from outside who disagree with the prevailing local view but people can debate with and explain things to them without banning them.
What alternative do you have to propose that wouldn't come with some horrible public policy downside?
One wonders if Chewie is still his copilot.
Do they? He's such an extremist that his own State has rolled back his policies already.
That doesn't appear to mean anything. Are you upset at me that you made yourself look foolish?
Never, ever do business with a company you can't effectively sue for fraud. When people can get away with cheating others (such as by having a business in a country without a functional legal system) many of them go ahead and make cheating into a business model.
Oy. So, so stupid.
Every developer reading this, please please go make a game with this list of bullet points as feature objectives. Perhaps not all of them, but most. It'd be the sort of awesomeness that can only be found in bits and pieces among a number of different games now. 
Yeah, that wouldn't fly in an actual courtroom. 
I suppose the good news is we just need a progressive Trump look-alike to secretly take over from the real one and get every policy we've ever wanted rolling.
The ones running lines of coke in class didn't get thrown in jail?
Depends, they could replace the VP first and then the ultimate president becomes the congress-picked VP.
You're accusing an academic and public intellectual of anti-intellectualism, seriously? What exactly do you think anti-intellectualism is?

Mars still has indigenous sources of carbon, just not the kind we're accustomed to thinking about on Earth. It's mainly CO2 ice that can be melted and carbon tied up in rocks that can be released by heating or vaporizing them.
He likely doesn't have the money up front to buy decent equipment. It sounds like doesn't even have the money to get necessary repairs made.\n\nResearch is deeply underfunded these days, only a small portion of people qualified to do research professionally even can because there's so little funding to go around. It's a staggering waste of expertise that could be spent on improving so much through important discoveries.
Out of curiosity, is it much easier to fly a plane in a simulator because you don't have to worry about inner ear confusion?

The 'bean counters' are independent of the executive branch, the President can't tell them to do anything.
You're basically historically ignorant, okay. Nothing I can do here.
I'm not sure I do, actually. There are too many to remember them all. Which one do you mean?
My personal experience is that the biggest downside of Aurora 4X isn't so much learning to play it but the fact that it's not really done (playable, but not done) and the creator only gets around to adding things to it every year or two because he has a day job and doesn't want to switch to full time Aurora.\n\nThere is hope in the Pulsar 4X project, essentially an open source Aurora 4X that's making progress in catching up to the official Aurora, but it could really use more coders contributing to it.
It also probably resulted in a lot of new people getting driven off immediately.
The 5th amendment doesn't provide protection from being compelled to provide a key, the key itself isn't incriminating. It's just a way of accessing physical evidence, and that's not protected by the 5th.

Don't forget that you can slow down to give yourself more time.
I'm not sure. It's more about how fast you cool it than how cold it gets, although shock freezing it with something even colder hitting it should cool it a little bit faster. I suspect it wouldn't make enough crystal growth size difference to matter. (Pouring in liquid nitrogen already freezes a mixing bowl of cream in something like a few seconds.) 
I've observed a similar phenomena in other contexts, members of different groups (such as racial or religious) who experience discrimination and even persecution nevertheless extending those same behaviors to other groups of different types. One example that comes to mind is the way the U.S. black community has tended to vote against gay rights issues.\n\nI wonder why it is that humans seem to have trouble learning from the experience of being subjected to discrimination that all discrimination is terrible.
They'd likely self insure to avoid the expense. There's no point in them bleeding their pockets to subsidize an insurance company.

There are ways of getting rid of an unqualified VP along with President. It was done with Nixon.
The CEA offers future predictions. They are not the agency that makes actual measurements, (the bean counters, as you put it) which is outside the executive branch.\n\nBe careful about accusing other people of being ignorant, yeah?
It'd be pretty great if the main guns could be made to shoot blanks.
Banning people who express dissent merely for dissenting is the lowest level of media bubble hell, though.  A healthy ideologically oriented sub will happily debate all comers on even terms because they're not afraid of outside ideas. 
Virtually nothing is re-election suicide for the 80% or so of them that occupy gerrymandered seats. They can do basically anything without fear of electoral consequences, like ensuring the oversight committee never engages in oversight.
Perhaps the law could be written to prevent police from arresting prostitutes they have sex with rather than banning all sex with prostitutes?
No, it was not. Congressional hearings are not courtrooms. The operative difference here is that congressional committees are very hesitant to hold people in contempt even for an obvious violation. It is extraordinarily rare.
Do any of them complain that criminals will buy their employees prostitutes to filter out cops?

Think about every society-changing piece of legislation that didn't involve a civil war. Just in the US there are examples like the voting rights act and the civil rights act and women's emancipation. Widen your scope to other nations and you'll find many more, both recent and historical.
On the topic of parallel research, it would make a great deal of sense if research virtually had to be parallel and shifting priorities took long term planning. Being able to do research involves people with a very long period of training and specialization. Biologists can't do engineering or vice versa, and it would take a generation to go from a system that focuses heavily on one of those fields to another.\n
I stopped reading at your claim that he used different metrics to compare California and Texas. He compared economic growth for both Texas and California, and just also mentioned population growth for California. You leaped on the population growth mention as if it somehow made the previous sentence about economic growth not exist.\n\nDid you not bother to read your own quote, or are you being intentionally dishonest? Be better.
Take a regular sample then, look at the past X number of posts in the subreddit by theists and see how many were banned for posting.
It doesn't really matter what he promised, he already got elected and that's all he wanted. It doesn't matter now if all the grand promises that were absurd to anyone who knew the topic in question fail one after another.
What makes you convinced that people won't simply do different things that aren't automated? That's been the trend so far. The buggy whip manufacturers go out of business, but the buggy whip makers don't remain a permanently unemployed segment of the population forever after. New industries arise, existing ones expand. \n\nI'm not trying to say that you're necessarily wrong, but I'd like to hear your argument for why the existing trend with all its great societal inertia is impossible to continue for the foreseeable future. (Perhaps Strong AI will one day even automate the sort of creative tasks we most associate exclusively with the human mind, but I don't think it'll happen in the next few decades at least.)
It only seems like peaceful change is impossible to you because you're not thinking about all the times it worked. You're too focused on thinking about armed rebellions.

Law enforcement is usually the one doing the rights violating. Courts are the party that reigns them in.
Petroleum is constantly being made too by its own geological process. The thing is that we use it far faster than it can be made. The issue is similar with helium and radioactive decay. 
It's unfortunately very common for surgeons to refuse to take difficult cases because their success rate statistics are so important to gauging how 'good' they are, which ultimately makes a big difference in their prestige and income. This can mean that people who need a difficult, low chance of success surgery might not be able to get it, particularly not from the best surgeons who have the most to lose by losing a patient.\n\nIn short judging professionals by their success rate is fraught with undesirable second order effects and is probably not the best way of judging someone's competence.
This reminds me of a great line once about how the purpose of really good contract drafting is to prevent lawsuits by anticipating anything that might occur and dealing with it in clear terms ahead of time.
He's not exactly a young guy, his career started a long time ago. That doesn't make it any less Republican though.
Reich served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. 
'legacy media' has less of an information monopoly today than at any point in human history since the invention of the printed word.
What about the problem of parties not standing the principles they say that they stand by whenever those principles would be inconvenient? For instance, the way Republicans claim to be for small government but want to use the government to make a variety of things illegal to impose their personal views on topics like abortion, contraception, sex education and marriage on every member of the population.\n\nI see an awful lot of people loudly claiming their position is all about principle but rarely do I see them live up to that supposedly deeply held principle. Instead principles seem to be used as a rhetorical device only, something to be readily abandoned for some other rhetorical device the minute one of them stops being useful.
Or perhaps in a battle that goes very badly, I could see craven as a sort of substitute for PTSD.

The reasons for Republican electoral success are complicated, but have a lot more to do with demographics and the quirks our election system than the Democratic party or democracy itself being somehow ineffective. That's just an easy thing to scapegoat.\n\nThe real problems are things like how the Republican base is much older and older people vote at a higher rate for various reasons, which helps Republican candidates win elections despite a majority of the populace opposing them, that sort of thing.
Liquid nitrogen ice cream isn't so good because it's cold, you actually have to let it warm up to a normal ice cream temperature before eating it. (Otherwise it'll be too solid to get a spoon into and also cause the tongue problems you described.)\n\nIt's good because the freezing occurs too fast for ice crystals of any significant size to form. The smaller the crystal size the smoother and creamier ice cream seems. This is also why ice cream that you allow to melt and refreeze in your home freezer doesn't seem nearly as good as the same ice cream was before you let it melt. Your home freezer takes a long time to refreeze it, allowing large ice crystals to form, making the ice cream crunchy in an undesirable way.\n\nSource: Owned a frozen custard shop for a while, learned a lot about ice cream chemistry.
That increase in payment in the form of benefits has been lost to increasing health care costs though, it hasn't in any way increased people's buying power. The money has gone to insurers and companies that provide the various elements of health care.\n\nMeanwhile other costs like housing and education have continued to rise.\n\nThe squeeze can't continue indefinitely. It's already unsustainable without rises in real wages.
Boiling would deal with any of the normal problems in sewage, I think. Bacteria, virii, protazoa and other parasites can't survive boiling.\n\nThe only two things I can think of that aren't stopped by boiling are prions (a relatively recent phenomenon in mass populations of humans, I think) and inorganic toxins like heavy metals. Lead and arsenic and so on.
Not even necessarily being coerced. It can be enough if the person never would have committed the crime without the officer's involvement.

If Trump's own public statements demonstrating how ignorant he is of basic domestic and world affairs aren't enough to show you that he's unfit then what exactly is your standard for fitness for high office?

People have to rent what's available, they don't have much choice over size unless they're building. It's not like there's an overabundance of small highly affordable housing to go around to choose from; contractors don't make money off of that sort of housing so they only build as much as municipal governments force them to in order to get permits for all the luxury units the contractors actually want to build.

I suspect he misinterpreted his lawyer's advice somewhat and thought that the 5th meant that he could just refuse to say anything at all regardless of the nature of the question. \n\nIf he were in a courtroom the judge would tell him 'You can't plead the 5th to something that can't possibly be incriminating, answer the question' but a congressional committee isn't really set up to work that way. They can just bring a contempt charge or not, and basically never do.

Legitimacy is about whether a child is recognized as the offspring of the father. It has nothing to do with being the offspring of the mother, which is taken as a given. It's all an historical artifact of there never having been any question of who a child's mother is but there wasn't any such certainty about who the father was before the invention of DNA based paternity tests.
The basic problem with automation is all the value produced by the automation goes to the people who own the automation, and those are not the people who need more money to survive. Preserving an equitable society and enough consumer demand to support an economy necessitates means of draining all the accumulated wealth back away from the aristocracy at least as fast as they try to accumulate it. \n\n
I wish there were mandatory reading somewhere for every author that an apostrophe is a way of leaving out a vowel, and it's almost always better to just include the actual damned vowel because if you leave it out people will insert one at random to make the word pronounceable.

Remember the golden rule of dodging torps; if a target can fire torps then keep the front or aft of the ship pointed straight at it. This counts for smoke that probably has destroyers hiding inside even though you can't see them.
Yeah, really. Theists come in all the time and they're not banned just for their opinions or asking questions. Sure, they'll find their ideas challenged, but that's not inherently disrespectful.

Something I might add is always being willing to gently remind them that they are loved and they have value and maybe helping them see that the future isn't necessarily as hopeless as it can seem through the obscuring fog of a depressed mind.\n\nSometimes just being reminded that you are loved and appreciated can really help on a bad depression day, and it's a simple thing that anyone can do.
Scientific work benefits all of us, that's why it's entirely appropriate for government to fund it.
True, although I'm not sure his various attempts at inventing scandals where there's nothing there could qualify as oversight either. Abuse of his position, certainly.
In the context of prosecutors only it might be at least somewhat positive if it encourages them to drop marginal cases where there's real doubt about success. Overzealous criminal prosecutors can do terrible damage to people's lives.
You look great, man. Good work. 
If you're up for a suggestion of something a little different and not entirely serious I recommend A Miracle of Science. It's a free and completed web comic about the interactions between a member of a fairly traditional sci fi human society from Earth and a member of a post-human society from Mars.\n\nhttp://project-apollo.net/mos/\n\nOne part of the premise is silly and much of it lighthearted, but in a self-aware way that doesn't take away from the more seriously examined topics. It's worth a look.
They haven't exactly suspended elections yet. You can put the molotov cocktails down for the time being and see if other methods work before making choices that drive support away instead of attracting it.

Hey man, I don't have an answer to your question but I just wanted to say that you're not alone in this. I had a very similar experience, though I'm currently at college struggling.

I was homeschooled so that the public school system wouldn't "label me as ADHD"\n\nTl;dr: you are not alone in this. 
This is the lunacy. I consider myself pretty liberal. But the whole point of the LGBT rights movement is that each person's sexual attraction is their own. A gay man can't be forced into finding a woman attractive, just like I can't be forced into finding a morbidly obese woman attractive.

Hmm. I don't know if this is possible, but maybe even if you kept it slightly but turned it way down. 
Yeah this was like a month ago, so it must be a state-by-state thing. I live in a liberal area where wealthy white women want their opioids. So I think that's just become standard practice.

Yeah, I weigh myself every day but I use the Happy Scale app to keep a moving average, so I can stay sane and analyze more of the overall trend. I highly recommend it.\n\nMy weight fluctuates about ±2 pounds on any given day.

Thank you!!\n\nYeah I find myself having a LOT more energy. Both physical and mental/emotional energy. Going to the gym used to be such a chore and now I really look forward to it. My gym partners used to have to convince me to go and now I'm the one dragging them along. \n\nI'm also finding it way easier to concentrate on things, which probably has more to do with improvements to mental health I've been feeling as a result of my new lifestyle. \n\nI've also felt way more confident. Getting in better shape has made me feel passionate about things again. I pay more attention to wearing nice things and taking care of my hair. 
Oh wow. I am very anesthetic resistant too, so I called my dentist and he said "oh just pop two pills instead of one."\n\nBut I also woke up during the procedure so I guess he knew I wasn't lying.

Does your school have an office for students with disabilities? My school will pay a classmate to take detailed notes for you. You should see if they offer something similar. \n\nAlso, ask your professor or disabilities office if you can make an audio recording of the lecture. 
I'm the same way. Medical marijuana basically saved my life. I've been on a downward spiral of anxiety and depression. After I started using cannabis to treat those, I've lost 30 lbs and my grades have started climbing back up. 
Sounds like that isn't healthy weightloss. You should probably consult a doctor. 
I think in general, they're seeking validation from the others there. "Should I be bad?" They want the other person to say, "treat yourself, girl! You deserve it!" To be met with a "yeah, girl you deserve it too!"\n\nThey want to enable each other but they test the waters by feigning as though it wasn't their plan all along. 
Generally, yeah, but it doesn't exactly scale proportionally. \nYou make enough to cover rent/costs but that doesn't negate the fact that you're living in a tiny condo instead of a larger house.

Right but /u/BunnyOpai is saying that the additional time allows the cat to assume an orientation that minimizes terminal velocity.

It's got a 5, a 4, and another 4.  That seems more intuitive to me than two little hands -- one of them points in the general direction of the correct number, but if the longer hand is a little to the left of the 12, then go back one.  The longer hand points to the numbers, too, but you should multiply it by five for some reason.
Depends entirely on what kind of vibration... if it vibrates proportional to road speed (and not engine speed), then also check that the wheels are round and balanced, plus probably a lot of other suspension stuff I don't know about.

Then they should have held a hearing and voted no.

At first I was going to ask if you'd used a wide angle lens because his face looks to be too big / out of proportion. But now I see it's photoshopped, something about the proportions still seem off -- like maybe he's been resized because he's not at the right distance to the camera? That and the lighting (especially on the left side of the face) seems unnatural.\n\nI do like the overall composition; I'm just getting an uncanny valley feeling that probably would have gone away if it hadn't been merged from separate photos.

I approach it using the same way aerodynamics work - no need to consider gyroscopic forces.  For stability in rockets and planes, the [center of pressure must be behind the center of gravity](http://www.rockets4schools.org/images/Basic.Rocket.Stability.pdf)^^* . The idea is that the point the force acts on (CP) must be behind the center that the vehicle spins on (CG). The equivalent on a bicycle is that the contact patch (where the force acts) must be behind the axis that the wheel turns on (line projected down from the handlebar bearing).\n\n^^* ^(modern fighter jets are inherently unstable and require a computer to make them stable) 
I was itching to hear more...
Sorry, this is a really technical reply, but I dove in to it...\n\nThere's nothing wrong with using a local variable - there is no overhead in creating and destroying it every loop. In fact, the compiler uses a register, so it's faster than a global or a  static. Also, since other functions can't unintentionally modify it, it's safer.\n\nHere's the code generated with a local variable:\n\n    14:sketch_jan25a.ino ****   int waterCheck = digitalRead(waterSensor);\n    47               \t\t.loc 1 12 0\n    48 0000 8091 0000 \t\tlds r24,waterSensor\n    49 0004 0E94 0000 \t\tcall digitalRead\n    50               \t.LVL2:\n\n\nAnd the code with a global variable:\n\n    14:sketch_jan25a.ino ****   waterCheck = digitalRead(waterSensor);\n    46               \t\t.loc 1 14 0\n    47 0000 8091 0000 \t\tlds r24,waterSensor\n    48 0004 0E94 0000 \t\tcall digitalRead\n    49               \t.LVL2:\n    50 0008 9093 0000 \t\tsts waterCheck+1,r25\n    51 000c 8093 0000 \t\tsts waterCheck,r24\n\nYou'll see the global variable version stores the value in global memory after it gets it from digitalRead... since it isn't used in other functions, this is kinda pointless because no one ever reads it from there.\n\nOf course, if you have a lot of local variables (too many to fit in registers), this will all change.\n\nUsing a static variable had even more overhead:\n\n    14:sketch_jan25a.ino ****   static int waterCheck = digitalRead(waterSensor);\n    47               \t\t.loc 1 12 0\n    48 0000 8091 0000 \t\tlds r24,_ZGVZ4loopE10waterCheck\n    49 0004 8111      \t\tcpse r24,__zero_reg__\n    50 0006 00C0      \t\trjmp .L3\n    51               \t\t.loc 1 12 0 is_stmt 0 discriminator 1\n    52 0008 8091 0000 \t\tlds r24,waterSensor\n    53 000c 0E94 0000 \t\tcall digitalRead\n    54               \t.LVL2:\n    55 0010 9093 0000 \t\tsts _ZZ4loopE10waterCheck+1,r25\n    56 0014 8093 0000 \t\tsts _ZZ4loopE10waterCheck,r24\n    57 0018 81E0      \t\tldi r24,lo8(1)\n    58 001a 8093 0000 \t\tsts _ZGVZ4loopE10waterCheck,r24\n    59               \t.L3:\n\nYou can see I made a mistake by just adding the 'static' keyword in front of the int. What happened is that it generated another variable to see if it has been initialized  (_ZGVZ4loopE10waterCheck) and uses that to call digitalRead if it hasn't been initialized -- all other times it uses the static value, which never changes. To do this properly, I'd need to initialize it static on one line, and then set it on another line. When I did that, the code compiles just like the global code.
It would be easy to keep that relay warm - just add a lightbulb nearby or run a little current through it whenever it is cold. Better yet, use a solid state relay.\n\nIf the relays in my car work and so do the traffic lights, there should be no excuse for these lights.

I got the Skull Canyon to stick on a self-driving 1/10th scale RC car. I needed something small, but with USB3 and enough multi-core processing power to do stereo vision processing.

No worries, Donald is a man of the world. He probably speaks six languages, just like his wife.
I suspect we'll get a third class of schools... the Hobby Lobby of schools. It'll be a secular school, but its owners will be religious and they'll want to be able to refuse service to gay kids.
Yemen? That's on-topic. They should ask him about extra-marital relations with interns.
A year ago we had a Responsible Gun Owner start shooting random people in the street (killing 3), despite 911 calls before the shooting of a guy carrying lots of guns and gasoline cans.  The mayor said ["I personally do not have an appetite for" tightening open carry laws.](http://gazette.com/colorado-springs-mayor-has-no-appetite-for-changing-citys-open-carry-law/article/1562684)\n\nThen we had the [Planned Parenthood domestic terrorist attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs_Planned_Parenthood_shooting), and still nothing; 12 people shot.\n\nNow this domestic violence call had the SWAT team arrive and negotiate with this delusional man, and they still let him kill his wife?\n\nWhen will Colorado Springs take reasonable gun control measures to protect its residents?
That's basically all school systems ... public/private, foreign/domestic.

They would be providing "Advice and Consent of the Senate" that the Constitution demands, and the ball would squarely be back in the President's court. This is how it normally works, and has been done many times over the years.
What we need is a pressure and temperature sensitive relief valve - maybe one of each if building it in to one unit is a problem. The pressure relief valve acts first. The temperature one only acts when the temperature is high enough to weaken the metal; it could be as simple as a tube plugged with lead.  Maybe use one at each end if necessary (to counteract uneven heating).

But don't worry... there are tons of pre-production cameras that can't be sold and have already served their purpose.

In the Netherlands, where I spent my teens it's a scale of minimum wage from the ages 15-21 starting at 5 euros an hour up to 13 euros (I think.) because I do agree that a 21 year old who finished high school should not make the same as a 15 year old drop out. 
Can confirm, crossed the road there last Saturday. It was crazy busy.

That's what they had in the past, they changed their terms and conditions on the first of July. Now you need a SCHUFA and they only offer 5 free withdrawals a month, as long as you make it your "primary" account.

Thanks for your kind words. We're discussing it right now. My girlfriend and I have friends and family over, and I kind of feel responsible. 
This was my problem as well. I looked for Sparkasse and Commerzbank, both charging withdrawal fees and monthly fees, sometimes even international transaction fees. 
So, why are you missing it?
I unfortunately found that out the hard way as well. That's why I looked for a strictly online bank, in the hopes that these banks would be a least similar to the ones we have at home. Least amount of contact with actual bank employees is preferred since my German isn't all that great and usually their English is non existent. 
Another report says that he probably was killed and the truck hijacked.. Poor guy.

I really don't agree. The fact that education is failing to keep up with changing times, where all information is literally available at the click of a button. In my opinion, having students repeat stuff from an overpriced, outdated book on an exam makes them lose respect for the system and unfortunately for the teachers.

This would be a great idea for some more insight into how certain teams might have an advantage compared to others. 
You will get more attention for that costume than most people with big expensive costumes. People will think it's "creative" and "cute." I do this to myself almost every year and forget to get a costume untill the last minute. I have won many costume contests with shitty, pieced together costumes.

The lack of diversity in political opinions on r/politics. 
Trust me, I am just as Pissed as everyone about the corruption inside the dnc that was exposed. I was a firm Bernie supporter, and was devastated when I found out that he was conspired against and pushed out of the running. But, black hat hacking into personal government emails is illegal, and we should not be supporting people who do this. Yes, in this case it brought the corruption of the dnc to light. But that doesn't mean we should go hacking everyone's shit in hopes of finding something bad or corrupt. 
This isn't anything new for him. His speeches are just angry ranting about how everyone is mean makes up lies about him. \n\nPoor poor Dono..

You can be progressive and do what you need to do for the country. I'm in the Army and supported Bernie Sanders to the fullest. I joined for school and a steady paycheck for my family, I don't think everyone needs to do what I did to have free education and free Healthcare. But I will gladly deploy and fight for our country, as long as it's morally, ethically, and legally justified. 
It's just a way of trying to suppress the younger generation and rile up the old folks. Every generation thinks their way is the right way, and want to keep the youngins from changing that. Because, if we change what's already in place, then the old timers lose every thing they have been working for. Its going to happen again once we millennials grow up and have been running the country for decades, those damn kids will come along try to fuck it all up. 
Understandable, I wasn't always as salty as I am now. I am in charge of my own team, and very motivated. I work my ass of day in and day out. I try to keep my morale high for the younger soldiers and am constantly motivating my soldiers be their best. My attitude I keep to myself and don't express it at work, ever. 
You say that now.

I have personally played as kallari, and I used to have a stigma against her. But I have seen a lot of people kick ass with her. I've noticed a kallari is only as good as her team. So, not to be a dick, but your probably so bad that your kallari can't support you. Tbo

I involuntarily moved to Georgia about 3 years ago, thanks to the Army, and had my first experience with Waffle House soon after I got there. My life has never been the same, the breakfast isn't the best I've ever had, but its still damn good.

Why haven't they expanded to the west?\n

I cant say if it has happened before or not, but am I wrong in thinking that being critical of the administration is part of democracy? I mean, aren't we supposed to be challenging each other, and having different views. If we had an administration that forced everyone to have the same opinions as the POTUS, our country would then be turned into a dictatorship, right?

Met my future wife in high school, I was a junior and she was a freshman. Her best friend was my best friends little sister. We happened to be at our friends house on the same day, and I saw her in the kitchen eating pickles, I sat next to her and asker for one because I have an obsession with those green dick looking veggies. we had a small chat and went on with our day. 4 years later we ran into each other at a party and have been inseparable since. 
I was forced to play mid Murdock yesterday, because iggy refused to go mid and took adc lane. It was actually a successful game, went 20-4. But Its not where Murdock belongs, I agree. 
I want that. 
FUUUUUUUU VOSIK!!!! 
From my personal experience, you can go two ways. First you can start with pendulum, just to get your health up, then build one more 12 point damage card, then work on physical and energy shield(depending on who is on the opposing teams lane your in will be the first to build). You will be tank with some damage to help weaken them. Or, you can start with pendulum, and just go straight tank which helps a lot for initiating and tower tanking/diving. This is what I did on the old map. In Monolith there really isn't initiating since the enemy can run away easily, since attacking slows your base movement speed. So I would go with the latter of the two. Good luck and see you on battlefield!

Trust me I'm all for it. California is my home of record, I'm currently enlisted military. I can't wait to go back and vote for this to happen. But it will be a very long, bumpy road to secession.

Currently in UAE, there are a shit ton of Indians here, Middle Easterners, and Brits. Yeah there is a lot of white people here, but they are certainly not the majority. At least from what I have seen. 
Good luck man, the Army doesn't just hand out TS though. I lucked out and got put in for mine randomly by my NCO. But unless your job requires it, you most likely won't get the opportunity to apply for one. 
This is the real question in all of this. 
It's like there's a pattern in destiny, or something? 
That is fucking beautiful dude! \n
The best advice I can give you about that is to be honest with the investigator, especially if your going for a TS. They don't care that you smoked, they just don't want any surprises down the line in your investigation. Unless your investigator is through MEPS in Los Angeles, Ca. That guy was a dick. 
What military? Yeah the National guards are state run, but they are federally owned. We would have to create our own militia in the three states, and just the forming of that could cause a civil war. It's going to be hard to succeed with the secession without conflict. 
Cigarettes, lots of cigarettes. And I would hide in the walk-in and drink the little 4oz mixed drink cans.

Don't sell yourself short man, you scored high on the asvab, you should have a lot of jobs available to you.

No bars, it's a unique situation. We are deploying soon, and this re-enlistment would require me to come back a couple months before the rest. When this opportunity first came up, I went straight to the BN cdr and Sgm, and they said it was OK with them as long as my chain of command approves. So I brought it up my coc, squad sgt, plt sgt, PL, and 1sg. All were OK with it and pushed it to the company cdr. Cdr denied it, even after everyone, and I mean everyone approved it.

 It was starting to get a little romantic. 
The sad thing is, most people are one sided, and think the other side is completely wrong. I think to have a real educated opinion or stance, you need to be some-what unbiased, while still holding on to your own beliefs. 
Not being cool enough to hang out with the older brother and his friends, but don't want to feel like a loser hanging out with the younger brother and his little kid friends. 
Sorry If that sounded like it was directed at you, I meant the die hard Trumpers who have gone silent in the last week. It seems the more sewage that spews out of DT's mouth, the more his followers fall back into the shadows. Or they are tired of losing ethical and political arguments. 
Sitting at a doctors office with my 4, almost 5 year old daughter. A mom walks in with her 3 year old son and they sit down across from us. The kid pulls out a book, not a children's book, a novel, and starts reading it. Then I look over at my daughter and have to tell her to not eat the weird black thing she found while rolling around on the ground. 
Well her acting is atrocious, so I would hope she would be in a skimpy bikini the whole time to offset it. 
I'm having the same issue. I can't figure it out\n
Cool thanks
Running couches can be great. They help you learn to control your breathing and stride. Nothing you can't find info on with just a quick Google search, but it's nice to have someone right there with you making sure your doing it right. If you don't think you can figure it out on your own, go for it. But I would maybe try and save yourself some money and ask the pt stud in your unit to help you out.

Along this same line of reasoning does you mom have a DNR and or a living will if not work with her to create these.

> The women I see being taken more seriously have a more masculine/androgyne style and in some cases unusual hair colors and cuts. I think I know how to approximate that but I don't think it would feel very natural.   \n\nI could see how unusual hair colors would feel unnatural. Although it's tech, it's still work.   \n\nBut I think the androgynous approach might have potential. Copy and try out some of the styles you've already seen on successful tech people.  
I also read it once in high school. I was going to read it a second time. And I'm curious about what I missed the first time around, especially with everybody talking about it so much. What are the biggest parts of Atlas Shrugged that make it unrealistic-- once we've seen how the real world works? 
"Extortion."
> repeatedly bark, breaking noise ordinances.  \n\nGot'em!
The phenomenon you've observed isn't something that is unique to the sex industry. I don't know the technical name, but it basically boils down to a "short-term vs long-term perspective of friendship". Some people fully enjoy knowing somebody for a few months and trusting them as much as a full life partner... only to trust another friend just as fully a few months down the road. It's just something that one can become comfortable with as you have more social experience.   \n\nIn essence, you aren't afraid to reveal everything about yourself to people who you would have (previously) not considered revealing everything to. And it isn't based upon a lack of fear, but upon a growth of people-knowledge: so that, I *know exactly* how this person can or can't hurt me.  \n\nYes, the girls you talked to were "opening up" to you. But it wasn't because they were overcoming their own inhibitions. They were opening up because of what they saw in *you*, as compared with all the people they've known and talked to over their lives. They had incredibly good judgement, and you passed their sniff test. (Around other people, those girls would have been totally "inhibited" and not-open to any GFE-type stuff). So, congratulate yourself for being judged positively by people who you have mutual respect for.  \n\nThere is one danger that goes along with being too comfortable with short-term relationships. And that is the need to be very careful around people who are only comfortable with long-term relationships (people like you, for example). As you have learned, we can inadvertently hurt the feelings of people who expect a much "deeper" connection (or people who may not comprehend that we already achieved the deepest of connections without their knowing). Of course, the only way we can learn if somebody wants to continue a friendship beyond what we've already experienced is if you tell us. So, hit her up.
Omg, sex!
You just took another puff, didn't you.
Does she like it though?

First, there needs to be demand. If women had more disposable income (as determined by their careers) and more free time (as determined by social and cultural expectations), there would be a huge increase in the number of job openings for male sex workers. This is actually one of the main benefits of feminism: you can finally get paid to have sex with socially empowered women (and make a shit ton of money).
The problem is the existence of line breaks. Contact the admin. Tell them to remove the line breaks from the templates used by their email server. Let them know their implementation doesn't work for mobile, and they will fix it.
Wow. Instagram's censorship policy is really getting out of control. I remember back in the "wild west" days of the Internet; back when we wouldn't get **banned** for posting shellfish [shrimp, in this case], peanuts, dairy, or other images of allergy-inducing foodstuffs.

I'm actually really looking forward to the UBI test results showing what effect UBI has on billionaires and multi-millionaires. UBI's effects on poor people is already being talked about in many ongoing studies. But I rarely hear the experiences of rich people. And that worries me, because I've heard a lot of negativity expressed towards the rich. I would hate to see the rich get hurt by an uneven implementation of UBI (or by any similar transgressions).

IANAL, but I think the official act of filing a suit is the mere submission of a typed-out essay called a "motion". Within this motion, add a paragraph or two mentioning the extortion. The judge will read the motion to himself before he even calls the case, and will ask you any questions if he isn't totally clear on any part.   \n\nThat's *where* to mention. As to *how* to mention it (in a way that preempts any questions and subtly supports and strengthens other parts of your case), I don't actually know... Some other Redditor will have to answer that.

In response to some of the advice here:  \n\nYour weight is good where it's at. (Big boobs are not a bad thing lol)  \n\nFashion is a personal expression. Keep dressing the way you feel; because otherwise you wouldn't be you anymore.  \n\nYour face situation is different from what a lot of people are used to. The individual facial attributes (e.g. nose, mouth, eyes) are popularly considered unattractive. But when you put them together, they take on an aesthetic quality and make you look beautiful.  \n\n[Imagine if you took ugly-colored paints, but then put them all together to paint an amazing picture. That's your face. It's beautiful, but not to your *average* model scout. Only high-end fashion designers and super-model scouts have the necessary "eye" to be able to recognize you on the street. Average artists (and especially non-artists) will easily miss the forest for the trees.]

Just read the latest update.   \n\nThe client had been informed of the possible presence of a service dog before the closing of the sale? This is exactly what you need to tell your lawyer.   \n\nThere may be some type of legal standing hugely in your favor. You were doing the responsible thing by providing the client with all the relevant information they needed before finalizing the contract. There were no "new disclosures" upon which they could use as the basis for invalidating the contract.  \n\nThat being said, it is bad for business to damage a relationship with clients. Thank them for requesting a new instructor and tell them you appreciate their business and you will definitely consider getting a new instructor *on their next contract*. But *until the next contract*, we BOTH need to abide by the terms of the current contract. Then stress that you are open to any ideas for accommodation.  \n\nOf course, the message in the previous paragraph should be fully vetted by an incredibly capable lawyer--the best money can buy.\n\n

Trump's tax returns (and any other objective measure of wealth) are irrelevant in determining Trump's billionaire status. Trump has stated time and time again that he is a subjective billionaire (rather than an objective billionaire). What's the difference between objective and subjective? For objective, you would need a billion dollars to be a billionaire. For subjective, you need to *feel* like a billion dollars to be a billionaire. And that feeling has to be genuine. Because Trump *feels* like a billion dollars, he is therefore a billionaire.   \n\nLet's say Trump told people he was a billionaire but didn't feel like a billionaire. Well, then he would be a liar. As previously mentioned, the feeling has to be genuine (or you're not really a subjective billionaire).

I was considering philosophy and rhetoric as potentially being taught in 11 or 12 grade. There are also different kinds of maturity. Budgeting and cleaning and responsibility towards your impact on the world is one, and dead parents is another. The idea I caught onto was having to think about and defend a career path. This would require an understanding of philosophy for the defense.
I don't know as much as I'm sure a lot of other people do. Stocks are a bit more volatile than bonds. Try and make a judgement without using politics as an influence for when to buy something, unless it'll give you a better deal. Check in on the companies for whatever field you think will do well in the future to see what are the most likely to succeed.
You are misunderstanding. UBI is for everyone. If you drop what you are doing, you gain absolutely nothing, except for the time you would have spent at the office, or in the factory, or on top of piles and piles of money, or wherever. If you keep working, because your job can't be automated or run by an advanced form of Siri, and you think the money received is worth the time put in, then you get the ability to purchase luxuries. UBI is only covering the cost of essentials in the area.

Be extremely dubious. But Lee Camp has done some good stuff. I don't see anyone else talking about oddities of exit polls not matching with machine voting results by huge margins, American imperialistic illegal attacks on foreign soil, or going on Fox News and calling them propaganda to their face.

Here are two links for you. One is from Medium, but does source everything, and has exit polls and voting counts all the way through New York. All but two of them are in favor of Hillary Clinton. New York, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Ohio, and Georgia are at least 10% moved in favor of Hillary Clinton. Our voting machines can be "modified," as happened to John Kerry in 2004, and the article also goes into a little bit of how. If you want more detail, I also included the more detailed study which included an attempted lawsuit.

OK. Yeah, emotional appeals have a large impact, and probably hurt us more overall.
Also that person in particular was killed by US Marines.
Well, as far as I know the Obama administration prosecuted more whistleblowers than any past administration. So they may be going after that.
I wouldn't say RT is more reliable than ABC. No one can deny they are funded and at least encouraged to say what the Russian government wants. And of course Russia would like to have everyone not caring as they invade other countries.
And we cut Social Security Taxes and reduce income taxes (particularly on those in a lower income bracket). We're also getting rid of various entitlements that haven't been terrible well liked. The taxes I'm talking about are focused on luxuries, things that are bad for your health, and things that are bad for the survival of the species as a whole.

Because people go into prison and often wind up in gangs or get out "hardened" and commit more violent crimes. This is due to being around more violent or sick people. Some things should be punishable by death so as to incentivize people to not commit these crimes. Mass murder is one of these.

That's why it has to be addressed at the governmental level. We need to encourage people to grow their own food, change suburb planning to include public transit, and have a wide range of buildings locally. It's a change in infrastructure.

Recently got certified and am about to start at LA Fitness. In the post above, Poliquin, who I am sure is a great trainer, apparently said "you shouldn't do both cardio and strength training." That is a mistake from everything I've read. I should have mentioned circuit training, which does contain some cardio in order to keep the body moving. I was not advocating only long form aerobic activity. I personally prefer to mix interval and circuits, and am only now throwing in steady state exercises because I'm considering a triathlon in the future. However, everyone should be tailoring their activity to what they are training for.
I think that part of the way this could work without entirely throwing off inflation rates would be to eliminate the minimum wage. Then you would have to tie UBI to inflation. Basically, the idea of a minimum wage to make sure that everyone who worked could survive. That's the idea behind a UBI, just changed to suit a world increasingly automated.

Then how the hell does mono green work? Have they made cards that generate any color now? Artefacts?
Perhaps. I'll try that. I was looking for historical context. I saw a few similar large statues there and I thought there would be a legend or something.
It's his most recent press conference. I think around 20 minutes in. It's worth watching all of it though. He lied a fair amount in the first bit, but was fairly honest (for him) for the rest of it as far as I could see.

Bill Clinton praised J. William Fulbright, who filibustered the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Senate’s president pro tempore was former Ku Klux Klan Exalted Cyclops Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) in 2010. Not to mention the 1990s Crime Bill praised by a Goldwater Girl.

So what in this clip was a lie? The lack of yellow cake uranium in Iraq, the fact this kid should have had paid time off, or the exit polls being off by huge margins from machine results?
An economic collapse is coming. And his friends likely know about it and will profit from it. And with the degregulation that's coming people making less than even 125,000 a year won't be protected. And there are no higher ups higher than Trump as of the 20th. And his rhetoric with a nuclear power like China are more likely to lead us into WWIII than anything else. In case you can't tell I didn't vote for him.
If it's a progressive tax system, they aren't being taxed much. And the lowest income (let's say up to $20,000) has the rate set at 0%, they aren't at all. The money has to come from somewhere, I just think that it'd be easier to get people behind targeted consumption taxes that aren't hitting necessities like food. And cuts in military spending, corporate subsidies, and entitlements that have been made obsolete as a result of UBI would help a lot.
How about the lies about weapons of mass destruction?
War crimes were committed by the United States there, ranging from torture in Abu Ghraib (although there are others like it) to the murder of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, an informant for the United States.
I appreciate the pacifistic thoughts, but there are times when stabbing someone in the eye so they won't burn more millions alive is a fine thing to do.
Not that I see.

One could target the sales tax on specific items, as determined by the local community. This would inherently have the exemption for necessities. For health reasons, alcohol, tobacco, carbon, and sugar could have taxes. For "morality" (which could probably be determined unconstitutional, especially if imposed from a Federal or State level) various drugs (if legalized), alcohol, or whatever is determined to be a "luxury."
Thank you very much.
The US and Britain targeted civilians too. And while I can see and hate the actions of insurgencies, I cannot enforce the behavior of outside groups. If war crimes become acceptable by the main world power, why shouldn't other countries do the same? That's why it's hard to condemn Russian actions influencing outside elections, as bad as it is.
You're a rad dude for not being snarky or pretentious about that.
I'd be down to clown if this ever happened.
You miss out on the badass fights too, not just all the raunchy humor in Shakespeare.
There are multiple socialist parties in the states right now. You should find one.
Automation is different from artificial intelligence. When we achieve pure artificial intelligence, perhaps we should give them the vote. But what makes someone deserving of a vote in the country? Citizenship, so a stake in the countries success or failure. Artificial intelligence may need an understanding of the history and government of the country for that, how can it demonstrate this, along with the empathy that comes from humanity?
Apparently he tried to say that we need to think about the Palestinians more, then AIPAC and his supporters threw a fit, so he went full Israel.
I think a good high marginal rate could be as high as 70%. And I think minimum guaranteed income could be around $20,000. I appreciate the attention to the currently incredibly unbalanced income scale for capital gains, which isn't actually producing any physical goods of value. The argument against corporate taxes is that it restricts innovation, as opposed to taxing the income that goes into the pockets of the CEOs. Also, if the taxes are 0%, let's say just for companies that employ primarily US workers then they are free to pay these workers a higher wage and provide jobs.
Considering the aftermath, they're mistaking the lever that leads the train into one person to the lever that leads the train to 600,000 people.
The sales of weapons (as is State department practice) to countries that then are known to sell them to religious fundamentalist groups with whom we are engaged in military conflict was a big deal, policy wise. This goes for both parties, and is in no way an endorsement of the empowering of a vitriolic white supremacist nationalist group by the image of all that is wrong with our current economic system.\n\n[Edit]: word
Something tells me that was staged. Call me crazy.
This is a comedy show. And people should be upset at the corporations that are running the show, because they are not caring for their workers. No one is saying Putin is a good person. What they are saying is that maybe we shouldn't start a war with a country that has nuclear weapons, a first strike policy, and is run by a crazy person. Of course you should be suspicious of it, and check the facts. But to dismiss what is said out of hand is also silly, particularly when the details are accurate.
I didn't think about that. I'm a fan. \n[Edit] maybe just encouragement to keep the small guvment people happy - such as a federal holiday and tax right off?
Personal trainer here. Please do some cardio. Aerobic activity is much better for your health. The order matters though. For strength training, don't do it first. For endurance, do it first. Do 75 minutes a week of vigorous activity, or 150 minutes of moderate activity. If you really hate biking, hiking, running, swimming, or general sports, then do interval training. High intensity interval training has effects proven to be similar with just 20 minutes work. You're not going to get "swole" with it though.
It's all good. I just see this as one of the most dangerous times to let that attitude take hold. There will be small victories, and if we keep pushing, pretty big ones too.
If it's written into the law to be specifically 18 years old gets UBI, it doesn't matter to a court how many tears are shed. The idea is to cut down on the bureaucracy and repeat paperwork and save money that way. This also makes negotiations about welfare a bit simpler.
What do you think taxes should be funding, and how do you propose to get them? As in income tax, capital gains tax, estate tax, sales/consumption tax. I think that a progressive income and progressive capital gains tax that eventually creates a kind of maximum wage is reasonable, an elimination of corporate tax, and a targeted consumption tax on items for the public good or as the community desires. For instance, a tax on sugar to reduce healthcare costs of obesity and diabetes or a heavy tax on alcohol or marijuana, as decided by the state or county. Do you think these taxes are theft and so shouldn't be allowed, or do you think they are necessary to pay for the single payer health care, free education, mental health and drug rehab, or the transition to green energy we must make?
Then what are you a fan of?
One thing I noticed was that there was an implication that there needed to be some of support for people in the ACA, children staying on their parent's health insurance until 26 (I think) and fairly clearly in Social Security and Medicare. Maybe the UBI is the support for people in the middle.
Basically marijuana effects the amygdala and accumbens. These are parts of the brain associated with emotional and reward parts of the brain. So it can lead to emotional mental illnesses like depression and bipolar disorders and a difficulty to kick other addictions or perhaps to have a harder time achieving your goals.
It's too bad he's too focused on defending his white base from those awful minorities with claims he can't provide any evidence for to bring up gerrymandering or crosscheck.
Baby, don't hurt me.
Read the study for yourself, and make your own conclusions. Everything in moderation, right?
Depends on how long term you're thinking.
I just watched the White Helmets. It's on Netflix now.
Someone crying because they didn't get UBI at 16 won't just be given it. If there is a legitimate reason to raise or lower the age that convinces more than 250 congressmen, 50 senators, and the president that sounds fine. I can't think of anything that could make it to the Supreme Court and convince 5 justices to do something so specific as change the age for UBI on the basis of tears.
A civilian who was killed by US Marines because he chose not to become an informant. People do die in war, but this war is not a war we should be in. The UN investigations were working. People do die in war, but civilians should not, especially if we have to occupy their land. It's not just wrong, it's stupid.
What was the physical test like for you?
Maybe they'll use it as a teaching tool for irony!
Service was his. The question is what is hers.
It's from a long time ago, but I'd say the challenge stands. Find the neighbor who voted Trump or abstained, and get coffee or something.
They probably would. That's why it's only one of many needed fixes: such as addressing the issue of unlimited donations and straight line redistricting.
BRUUUUUHHHH!!!
Going vegan and voting for more taxes for public transit?
Rex Tillerson referred to climate change as an engineering problem that had to be addressed to help humans adapt to changing conditions. Not a bad idea and one that has to be done, but if that's the focus we are totally fucked.
I actually was fortunate enough to end up in a job for 5 years that was my dream. My career is changing now, so we'll see what's next. Philosophy would widen the reasoning for choosing a job to be not just about financial stability, but also to consider the impact of yourself on the world. Do I think aesthetics are important? Perhaps I'll go to be a hairstylist. Am I concerned about the environment? Perhaps I'll go into forestry. But then there's the rhetoric and defense part, where I may say why are you focused on beauty? There are some serious problems in the world. And they would have to defend their chosen career against that. The class could be used to critique the speeches as to their use of logic. Or peer review papers to allow improvement before grading. The class could also be a variation on senior projects or thesis projects that some high schools have. It would be a chance to defend careers. Perhaps what happens is there's a list of careers that are expected to have the most growth and students have to choose one to defend.
Only 137 people have signed it. There are 2147 likes on Reddit. Something is wrong here.
It's terrifying to think about how Breitbart will be speaking directly into Trump's ear.
In general yes, but as this is an executive action it is more likely to have to do with the Trump Hotel and Trump Home businesses in the country.
Shouldn't there be no donations from anyone, business, union, or charity? What about the separation of church and state?
Against.
That's funny. I always wanted to give my ex flowers but because I had given a previous ex flowers the mere thought made her furious.
Many of us did protest the Iraq war. I was one of them.
Thank you. I've been trying to find an easy way to word this to people.
Not just what others have said about consensus, but China and India have made tremendous strides in terms of following through on their commitments to climate change. China in terms of the speed of it's transition to clean energy, and India in terms of their reforestation, which is also moving Pakistan and India at least in a direction of peaceful relations.
Solved!
You know, you're right. It's much better if we all give up and let corporations screw us. Why should our government be more representative of what the people want?
Exactly and what really is a "flashy" fact?\n\nA fact is benign. A fact has no intentions. 
You can pull bacon straight from their backs. Mmmm. 
Amen
Just Cause 2 and 3 + mods = love. 
No, rich enough to buy legislation, like .01% rich. 
The skeleton did as well. Fake. 
There is definitely a lack of non-partisan journalism. \n\nIf Cracked wants to fill that void, I am sure plenty of folks would be attracted to such a thing. 
I completely understand the difficulty with balancing free speech and rules of conduct.\n\n\nApologies and admitting wrongdoing isn't easy, but is commendable.\n
Spamming the X button.
Yea. Between this and TWD all I see is Trevor being or wanting to be Trevor. 
I thought you meant the original floppy disc. 
Yea, Kurt wasn't in it for poser girls, much less market saturation. \n
I remember that ad when I was younger. Classic!
You should bring a Skymall catalog for passing the time. 
I agree. It could have been done better or not at all. \n\nBut not being able to land a job because of a single post about legitimate frustration without verbally attacking anyone specific is a punishment not equal to the crime. 
Makes you wonder who is undermining and why. Ok, maybe "wonder" is a stretch .
Also shown in that Herzog documentary "Inferno". \n\n(Netflix)
Just be happy that they are considered art. \n\nI don't think Nirvana was all that great either to be fair. \n\nI like bands that were inspired by Metallica if that helps? 
The "eminem off the air" thing has played out every decade or so. It is ridiculous, and equally ridiculous to stop supporting an artist you enjoy just because a portion of the art isn't your thing. 
Apparently it is EXACTLY how it works.   
Plot twists:\n\nThe initial text was the wrong text\n\nWho REALLY wants chocolate after filling up with chips and crine\n\nThe Suitor would need to risk his life by treading chest deep through a local marsh to reach the market; it was much less shallow due to a recent lack of rain. 
For me it was his interactions with Lawrence for the most part. 
Are you familiar with the circle of 5ths?
Sure, but where do you draw the line?
And horns! (I LOVE communicating with my horn!)
Sorry to confuse you, I can't recall which theory dealt heavily with vibrations and multiple universe concepts. 
Sorry. \n\nFor 15 years a person would hit "cancel/red"     in order to make the purchase a "credit" transaction. A "credit" transaction has no additional fees from the bank. \n\nLast year, with the start of chip cards, a person now needs to hit the green/enter button in order to achieve what hitting the red/cancel button once did. \n\nThose in retail are VERY frustrated with what seems to be a small change. 
This is a joke, right?
I see 2 things "dig" and now maybe a baby. \n\nDoes the 2nd part of their rule involve duplicating?\n\nWhy did we see another Maeve get maid?\n\nWho was ford making, Abernanthys replacement? Maeve's replacement?
I think the core of the issue here is that who ever made up this rule in which you MUST be one or the other doesn't realize the world and especially humans are not 1's or 0's. 
Even US citizens realize this shameful behavior. But the US leaders have been shameless for generations, so I suppose nome of this should  come as a surprise. 
Yup, i wish I was still ignorant. I could see why a person would fight to get that bliss back. 
Really? He pretty much played the same schtick in Aliens. Granted, it was great schtick. \n\nPersonal BP favorite = "Frailty" 
Chicago. Not too bad actually. 
That being said, I normally don't read Mr King but I couldn't put down The Stand a few months ago. 
Sounds dangerous!\n\nHow does a person properly dispose of very old ammo?
We're not talking about crap. This is his life. He was actually 100% correct that while a person searches for employment, they are also bombarded with scams and these commission based pyramid scheme jobs. \n\nIf potential employers are passing on candidates for even the smallest of reasons then the public should be throughly educated on these matters. \n\nHow many people wouldn't make a post about real world frustrations if they knew it could stop them from even receiving an interview anytime during their future regardless of their work experience or degrees?\n\n
The children shouldn't be punished for the behavior of their parents. \n\nIf the money can't be returned without any chance of negatively impacting the welfare and standard of living of the children, then the money shouldn't be paid back by the mother. \n\nUnless the mother had a DNA test done and still went ahead perjured herself, I fail to see how it can be proven in court that she broke the law.\n
This person cared enough to post about it. \n\nThe "journalists" cared enough to write an entire article about celebrities. \n\nJust look at how much marketing depends on celebrities to sell products and even to push ideas and concepts. \n\nRight or wrong, subconscious or consciously; people develop connections to people who are put on television or whatever medium. \n\nSo, the better question is why would someone make such an obviously bs article/headline. \n\nClickbait. \n\nWhat we see here is a victim of stupidity posting clickbait on social media so even more clicks go clicky. \n\nA much better article would have been a scientific explanation as to why people care about celebrities at all. \n\nI love watching certain actors do their jobs and entertain me. But, this entire industry designed to tell me what the celebrity does outside of the work/art itself baffles me. \n\nActually the "news" in general is pretty pathetic now that I will stop rambling and ponder about such things. \n\n\n\n
Civil Engineering. 
Stupid language rules. 
I thought they have made Jackman appear much more stout/shorter in the last few films. \n\n\n\n
The common diagram for The Circle of 5ths looks a lot like the cells that Hap used and the aquarium Homer found. Music (violin, Haps gift, the rings of Saturn, etc) and sounds (vibrations/movements) seem to have a reoccurring role.\n\n
Destruction = construction \n\nWhy do u think we keep continuing wars? \n\nThere is huge money to be made in destruction as well as the resulting construction/ cleanup. \n\nPlus after insurance the target company may be better off.  
A Cpap machine is a somewhat shitty life hack. 
This is what a disco ball would look like in a black hole. 
I will need to dig into that wiki, it IS similar, but it wasn't specific what I was speaking of in regards to the circle of 5ths. \n\nVery interesting though ty. 
Ken M?
Aside from Nirvana your vagina is better off. 
To be fair the changed protocol in my area. What was once a red/cancel push is now green/enter if a person would like to avoid a PIN transaction charge. \n\nFor 20 prior a person would need to cancel the transaction for a credit instead of debit transaction. If your bank charges for only PIN transactions, then cancel/red would save a person $$$
I couldn't find the Stairway to Heaven joke :(
Fair enough, but making that decision based on a single post like his doesn't seem right. \n\n\n\n\n\n
I am a geeky cartographer and I approve these diagrams. 
I just did a bad job with making a comparison to crime and punishment. \n\nAt what point are people going to be discriminated against for a job and at what point is the stupidity harmless?\n\nNow there is a generation that has hundreds of "stupid" things said and shown on social media. \n\nAt some point half the population will have said or done something worse on social media. Just because even the smartest of the smart will post something "stupid" or "wrong" from most HR department staff. \n\nI have a relative that is king of inappropriate social media comments, yet despite his comments he makes plenty of profit for his company. \n\nNow using your logic, his comments should have eliminated him for an interview, and the company he works for would be without their most productive employee. \n\nLike I said, a single comment being extrapolated out to determine the value of an employee before even a simple phone call or even in spite of work history and education may be "right" but it sure doesn't seem "right".  
And yearly maintenance costs. \n\n
Yea, how do we know that these employees are not using the success of a game as a launching pad for their own careers?\n\n
Thank You!
Sorry but a lot of things are made to be broken. \n\nLazy writing. 
She worked at that fast food restaurant for 24 years!\n\nThe manager said she could have the food (but not the fries)\n\nThe manager sees her leave with the fries. Instead of telling her he only meant she could have the sandwich at that moment, they decided to fire her instead. \n\nThat job was her life, and they took that away because of .50 cents?!\n\nBankers steal billions (if not close to a trillion dollars) and they are given bonuses and unheard of retirement packages. \n\nA fast food worker with a 24 year work history with the same company loses her livelihood over .50 cents of fried potatoes. \n\nDoes that sound like equality to anyone?
"Turtle" in Breaking Bad
Because US elections are a farce and have been for generations. \n\nWhy do elections take place in the winter?\n\nDiscouragement at every turn, in ways that appear minor when examined individually, but appear with crystal clarity when taken as a whole. 
Yea, a stunt double used it. 
Wouldn't it be amazing to see just the smallest bit of information about your family going back dozens of generations?\n\n
As long as corporations can make trillions off death machines they will continue to proliferate.

They should have ended it with a fight. 
Looks like a new sidewalk and people are still following the temporary path. \n\nI think a new path will start to form. 
Wait, how do we know who the criminal is based on just a photograph that is clearly photoshopped. \n\nMaybe she hit her target?
I am going to let some of the disjointed plot points and all the lack of character development pass because it's Star Wars. \n\nI still enjoyed the movie, and rumor is that future "special" editions will include many scenes not in the theatrical release. \n\nI would still rate it higher than all the prequels. 
It sounds like there are types of people you can't get along with just like him. \n\nHe wasn't putting down anyone specific, he is frustrated because even though there are millions of people with something tangible to offer society they are not given the opportunity other generations had the benefit of, my own generation included. \n\nGiving him a thorough and negative psychological assessment based on a single comment isn't fair to you or him. \n\nIf you have never had to feel the frustration of hundreds of no-result applying then I can understand why his frustration seems unjustified. \n\nWhen a person is only getting those pyramid scheme commissions calls after years of working, going to school full time, and having so much college debt on the mind; it is normal to voice frustration in such situations. 
The summer of 15" sounds interesting!
If you see yourself siding with the empire, you might want to reexamine your values. 
Don't companies get caught inflating their products performance often enough to question this?
I disagree with a single post being a better indicator or predictor of an individuals potential value. \n\nLike I said, sometimes obvious red flags can jump out like racism or sexism. That I do understand. \n\nAnother aspect I have not even mentioned is that all these social media accounts are relatively easily hacked or the company itself has had unreleased/released data breaches. \n\nThere are exceptions to everything, I know life isn't fair, but hiring practices are designed to be fair by law. \n\nIt is possible that discriminating against potential employees based solely on a single instance of social media speech will be determined to be too harsh and laws will be passed if it becomes a significant issue. 
That's the thing about engineers, some of us have horrendous social skills (myself included). I didn't mean to argue with you, I was truly attempting to understand why a single comment could carry such a heavy weight. \n\nBut, without a doubt, you have informed me that certain positions, careers, and individuals need to carry themselves within certain social tolerances in order to maintain a marketable atmosphere. \n\nReducing risk is always a priority for us, and I see how that can apply to social media. \n\nAnd, the simple truth is that for most of us, it is a tough market for finding a quality job, and I have always been careful about pictures and posts. \n\nThat being said, I see younger generations constantly saying things on social media that I think will severely hurt their chances of potential jobs based on what you have been describing. \n\nHappy holidays! and I hope your company is prosperous for a very, very, very, long time. \n\n
It doesn't necessarily mean that his demeanor there is directly connected to the feud. \n\n\nMaybe he just dislikes being at those conventions.
Did you know Jar Jar Binks was a sith lord?
Willis Tower. 
Exactly, the sooner you found out the better even if it is a group text. \n\n
The prequels. They should be condensed to 1 or 2 great films. 
I had no idea that this was also the end of Hugh Jackman. Tragic. 
To be fair, balls were never specified. 
Yea. Higher insurance premiums for risky behavior just like adolescent males. 
So, you are saying if it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal trial that the mother knew with 100% certainty that the man was not the father, but nevertheless went ahead with "defrauding" the man.  \n\nThen yes, if she is proven guilty/pleads guilty, then a civil trial would be in order for retribution $$$ after the criminal trial. \n\n
Yea. My wife said the same thing until she walked into my bank and discovered I was telling the truth. \n\nShe also witnessed it about 10 mins ago at the pharmacy. \n
Buildings lives matter- Che
I do remember seeing 7's and 11's I just figured a casino bought ad time. 
Amen
They did eventually knock it out. 
I get it, your job does sound substantially different from my career in civil engineering. \n\nAs far as hiring goes with engineers; A candidate is not qualified because he/she posted something that certain work cultures find unforgivable, a candidate isn't qualified because he/she was built to the incorrect specifications and standards. 
If an individuals justified or not statement on social media carries more weight than years of real world experience and education then something is seriously wrong with the way people are assessed and hired in your area. \n\nI could understand if the person was being racist or directing hate towards specific individuals.

To be fair, Syria is one of the few times the CIA didn't muddle things up.  The US and Russia have been backing the SDF against ISIS since 2015 which has made some pretty solid headway into the heart of their territory.
Were there previous owners or something before the 6 years?
There are a lot of question mark free agents from Romo to Rivers to Fitzy.
And?  Are you  familiar with the timeline and risky actions the US undertook to find then assassinate him?\n\nOr are you implying all of that is false and Washington knew where he was the entire time because he was somehow an asset?
We do have stronger figures of close to 90% for Atlantic Seaboard natives due to smallpox and bear in mind this was a sudden exposure to a shotgun of infectious diseases all at once so it wasn't just death to one specific plague like we saw in Europe or Asia.
Even the Pentagon's own internal audits identified almost half of the budget as redundant while the Army couldn't account for hundreds of billions in spending.  Even accepting the first analysis as subjective, this is according to even insider perspectives that change is needed.
Neat, Zaire has come a ways since the African World War.
That shit was so hilariously enraging when you weren't watching and cavalry just shredded your ships on a ford.
Loyalists?
Except again, there isn't much proof of either.  \n\nThere is proof of cooperation between parts of ISI and parts of the Taliban but this is literally six degrees of separation from your original premise that the US aided bin Laden which is patently false.
The Amazon's biodiversity may number a good million species and I think dozens (plants and animals) get wiped out a year due to man or just plain natural chaos.
The CIA and Pakistani ISI gave local Afghani mujahideen weapons because they represented assets for regional control; neither wanted much to do with bin Laden's small foreign cell of fighters.  
At that rate, Darth Vader would've had an entire secret army of secret apprentices though.
That means it's been endorsed.
[There's a related story about Connecticut non-profits that are working to help victims of domestic violence and increase awareness](http://fox61.com/2017/02/24/domestic-violence-advocates-speak-out-after-bridgeport-murder-that-led-to-amber-alert/).\n\nThat's kinda the issue here moreso than the killer's legal status given he was deported before this.
**Unless...**
Maher is more libertarian than liberal and has routinely gone against left political positions when it suits his contrarian ideas.  Neither of the two are political leaders per se while Milo has a following beyond entertainment with a specific message.
That's a pretty broad brush to paint with.
Voter ID laws are racist.  North Carolina state legislators literally looked up demographic data to see how blacks preferred to vote before crafting their bill - and it was legally struck down specifically due to discrimination.\n\nAnother state limited access to DMVs in minority areas while others added requirements targeting elderly minorities who were born before the 50's and lacked the right papers.  Their racist nature is now a legal fact and it's why so many have been struck down.\n\nAs for Trump's supposed stance on legal immigration, that was a write-off the second his executive order banned legal green card holders from entering the US.  It was only an ACLU court action which forced those provisions to be deemed unlawful with at least some legal burden of discrimination.\n\nAs for welfare programs, 60% of people on Food Stamps work or have worked in the same year because of how low many states keep minimum wage so I'm not sure how that's keeping people down.  Like I've said, minorities vote Democrat because they don't see another welcoming choice and it's been that way for quite a while now.
There will be twists that will make you warm to some characters and hate others.  For the most part, it avoids being soapy and instead focuses on real development although you should not get too fixated on all of the mysterious stuff.
Well, a crash landing
Submission Statement: This isn't the usual content but I figured it was interesting because it suggests that the Amazon forest is far from an impenetrable uninhabited wilderness commonly portrayed but an area whose biodiversity is due to lots of ancient native activity.\n\nThis mirrors the Atlantic Seaboard in the colonial era which was highly conducive to new settlements due to centuries of forest clearing and farming by Native Americans.
Hey now, don't diss wrestling.  Some of us like to enjoy it ironically authentic.
I think the Amazon was considered almost an exception to the rule given how large it was so this research might reconcile that or even lead to some further archaeological finds.
There are 3 different GoFundMes apparently but glad to see all three victims, including the one deceased, are all seeing some love.
It's not treasonous but it is certainly unpatriotic.
It's always been difficult for law enforcement to deal with domestic violence even for citizens.  *Besides, this guy was deported after proper action by the police.*
Yeah but he had the form all filled out with the right checkbox.  Now he has to do it all over again.
I see everyone taking easy shots at Huffington Post and no one [bringing up the OG marathon cheater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txv0hUPW1_k).

This is a great writeup especially on engaging with government at a local level.  A lot of progressives have been able to get elected there in ways that are still further away on a national level.\n\nEven dyed-in-the-wool conservatives are starting to see the immense value of health care which may become a more powerful issue than social wedge things like abortion or gay marriage, which the White House seems eager to sidestep for the moment.\n\nIt's possible to buy a cheap version of older codes of Parliamentary Procedure for 10 bucks on less, especially on Half or Amazon, and your link has a companion site [here](http://www.parlipro.org/).  C-Span is also a very good resource as it shows the nitty-gritty of motions, committees, and other procedures in Congress as it happens (with reruns later in the evening). 
I kind of hoped he would stay in the quarantine show with Skip Bayless; now they're both loose in the wild.
To what degree?  The Republicans swung first the boomer and elderly vote with Tea Party hysteria in 2010 then the independent (not to be confused with centrist) vote.\n\nRight now, they're losing ground with both blocs due to health care so there's more acceptance of progressive reforms in that area (if one sees the ACA in that category) but being centrist got the Democratic Party through two generations of post-Southern Strategy elections.  It's not on the Democrats entirely if progressives failed to turn out in 2010 or decided Hillary was the worse of two evils in 2016.

Well, negative Internet points.
> America was willing to give dozens of dollars to Afghanistan in military aid, but close to nothing in schooling and service type aid pre-9/11.\n\nThere wasn't a window for the US to do that except between the small one between the fall of the Soviet-backed regime and the 80's civil war which culminated in the rise of the Taliban over 2/3 of the country.\n\n> We sent people to visit the mujihadeen, we wrote articles about our guns in the hands of freedom fighters.\nI lived through this shit. Operation Cyclone is what I'm talking about. The US directly and deliberately armed rebels to prevent a soviet takeover of Afghanistan.\n\nThat's literally what I said.\n\n> The issue is the fact the jihadists and the freedom fighters were the same people.\n\nAgain true.  This is 3 paragraphs and still no links between the CIA or ISI and bin Laden, who was a foreign leader of a small cell that neither had any use for.\n\nI agree that US statecraft and intelligence policies involved a lot of bad deals with bad people but it was always based on maintaining a local network of relationships which bin Laden did not represent at all.  It's why they had links to the Northern Alliance who held the northern third of Afghanistan against the Taliban through the 90's right up to the day that the US invaded.\n\n\n> How can you say that they didn't try to arm bin laden when we fucking praised the man himself for being an 'Anti-Soviet Warrior'?\n\nThat's an article from The Independent, which I believe is a UK paper.  Again, you connect no dots.  If you want to state that the US made ill-advised deals with anti-Soviet militias who lacked the ability to reconstruct the country, that's entirely right but that truth has little to do with this long debunked US-AQ link.
What?  This is a GoFundMe for the victims of an alleged hate crime.
So a cassowary kick to the face?
It was a normal thing in the South; there was already a minority of vocal abolitionists in the North when the US was founded which grew until the issue killed the Whig Party and sort of split the other two major ones.\n\nEven the Southern Founding Fathers including Washington came to believe that there was an intrinsic wrong in enslavement but had no problem repeating its everyday benefits.
There's also Earth X and Universe X which are Ross' and ~~Busiek's~~ Kreuger's take on a more messed up future where everyone has superpowers with an impressive twist at the end.  You also see a bit of Ross' distaste for X-Men though as he always saw them as a bit too morally ambiguous a "gang" even at their base.
I agree he's complex but it is accurate to say that he certainly could have "known better" by his era.  Ideas and examples of equality were certainly available by his formative years; Wilson was far more willing to keep progressivism for WASP/Germanic males than other standard bearers like Roosevelt including his invective against white "hyphenated Americans" who were only beginning to assimilate.
I feel that Kubrick would have been far more of a prima donna and too exacting to pull off this conspiracy.
Good point but this does appear to be more advanced and continuous alteration of the ecosystem by indigenous peoples.
I think it may not fit the "untamed wilderness" narrative that we've assigned to other areas we considered to be mostly deserted or uninhabited historically.
I would say so only to a point as it repeatedly brings up conservative viewpoints in a favorable or even-handed light so it's more biased than pornographic.  Sorkin doesn't really take the gloves off until Newsroom when things were so polarized that his message of centrism on the West Wing seemed to almost evaporate.
Kongming would be impressed with this level of guile.
Right.  Because organized Christianity certainly hasn't infiltrated the US government.
> It's a bunch of bandwagon hate for a conservative news pundant because he stated on air that there's some creepy coincidences involving known paedophiles and some powerful friends of democrats.\n\nSo are you saying we shouldn't be skeptical of a conspiracy theory that has been thoroughly debunked? \n\nYou can't expect fifty post mortems on something on that level of awful which directly provoked at least one act of attempted violence.
Wonder if they'll ever sell exported goods grown in black earth like coffee grown in volcanic soil.
Making a circle around Pakistan, India, China, and Indonesia would cover about half of the world's population alone.
I'm not hinting at anything and I like plenty of conservative ideas but this is the President we are talking about here, not just a random person in the GOP.  A good number of those conservative ideas from anti-immigration to anti-segregation to Voter ID laws to safety net cuts to budget cuts have disproportionately hurt minorities whether by intention or not.\n\nAnd yeah, it was Radical Republicans who ended slavery and it was moderate Republicans who helped pass the Civil Rights Act against the Dixiecrats but it's not exactly a coincidence that Republicans have almost always carried the South since then while white Democratic incumbent counts have stayed low.  Most minorities wind up voting Democratic not because of preference but often simply by default.
There's lots of "legal" loopholes in background checks; something around 10 to 20 percent of inmates in one survey said they procured their firearms legally although stealing and the black market were still ahead.
Don't forget Warren Harding, who until now was probably the record holder for the most corrupt Cabinet.
*before he was going down, fixed.  Also, weren't WWII planes usually going too low and slow for there to be usually instant death on hitting the water surface?
Chase has reportedly been like that for a long time although he seemed to have improved after the wake-up call he got from his roast from a lot of the jokes he got thrown his way.

You say fuck Asian shit but a Chinese guy would have probably supported that sentiment at the time.
And for anyone unsure about adopting a mixed breed especially for kids, they are usually less likely to develop costly and often heartbreaking genetic defects that will shorten their lifespan.
You could make a case that there's at least a flyer RB at any team [ranked with a Top 10-15 O Line](https://www.profootballfocus.com/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-lines-this-season/).  The Packers literally put a wide receiver in the backfield for half the season and three playoff games who produced decently.
Yes, this is true without the quotation marks.
It was a little tough to read all the way through on the first try due to the structure but I will give it another shot.
To a point, Obama was more progressive than Clinton but I imagine like Sanders, he also wanted to make a rapprochement with the Republicans which in hindsight was a mistake.  While he did favor small defense cuts and overruled her in regards to larger action in Syria and Libya that would be even larger quagmires than Iraq or Afghanistan, Obama was fairly hawkish in regards to drone use, surveillance, and coming down even harder than Bush on any leaks.\n\nAnd not to be an apologist, but he was also convinced by the party to not make too many vocal progressive calls so as to not cost Congressional seats in 2012 which also did not stem the Republican share much.  Sanders is definitely more progressive than Obama and I think the most genuine reformer we've seen, something even those strongly opposed to progressive ideas have admitted.
It just looks like some beautiful painting to me.
Submission Statement: This isn't the usual content but I figured it was interesting because it suggests that the Amazon forest is far from an impenetrable uninhabited wilderness commonly portrayed but an area whose biodiversity is due to lots of ancient native activity.\n\nThis mirrors the Atlantic Seaboard in the colonial era which was highly conducive to new settlements due to centuries of forest clearing and farming by Native Americans.
The nativist ones sure seem to.  It's not a broad brush when that was the core of Trump's platform and recent policy actions.
Especially Pickles.
It would be a good arc to see a Robin that truly becomes Bruce in mind and method.  None of his foster sons (or daughters) ever really wanted to embrace the kind of grim determination that he had.
This has been happening for a while as cheap labor has moved to Vietnam or Bangladesh especially for textiles.\n\nBeijing *tried* to stem this by subsidizing college degrees but there's still an oversupply of graduates; Central Asia or India could make for good market expansions to facilitate that since they're surrounded by East Asian economies which are fare more developed technologically.
It's all about the Sea Cav!
X-Men too so it'd be an ensemble show where Acker has really shined before.
Yeah no.  Having the Fed, especially as it was envisioned after FDR, helped tremendously stabilize the economy after a century of speculative uncontrolled economic shocks that would routinely trigger depressions and job loss.\n\nThe "old" system involved a Congress in which one house was not directly elected directly taking huge shares in companies in exchange for no oversight or favorable reciprocation that had direct but uninformed control of our currency.  It also doesn't help your position that while Wilson was somewhat progressive, he was anti-black and anti-women's suffrage.
DC probably has more of a rep as a planned capital city but this still looks beautiful.
There's more primary source evidence for the sudden drop in population both from European and indigenous sources as well as archaeological finds documenting a sudden population drop; this is more for Atlantic Seaboard deaths from disease, mind you.\n\nWhile the Spanish were initially more barbaric against native populations, there was also far more intermarriage while North American native tribes saw consistent population drops not just from ethnic cleansing but also rolling epidemics well into the 20th Century.  Many were also understandably suspicious even when American officials offered free vaccination in the 19th Century.
You are the worst person ever on the Internet.
The pilot might have already been dead by the time the bomber was ~~hit~~ going down; getting knocked out would probably be a small mercy compared to being burnt alive or drowning.
It just seems to me he never got a coach or QB coach to really break him down to rebuild his mechanics and instinct.  He was told he was the guy and expected to be the guy without the steps that come first, at least from the outside looking in.
Thanks for the info.  I hear China has also made strides on more advanced manufacturing to close the gap with other industrial competitors especially for superconductors.
The VC mostly fell apart after the Tet Offensive but it was enough to shake public opinion.  The South Vietnamese held out for several years and beat back the first conventional attack by North Vietnam (albeit with US air support) but the second one in 1975 did them in.\n\nWho also got fucked over were minorities in Vietnam, some of whom had helped the US forces like the famous Montagnards.
We've only had a few Presidents actually get JDs though; six apparently from the time they graduated.
Speaking of which, our teams also had a race for the bronze medal last year.  We both lost.
Stalin would love this shot composition.
I understood why people play that card like they're a sales contact about to lose a huge account.
Yeah, I definitely agree it's not the entirety of Trump supporters; there were definitely many who bought into the anti-Hillary propaganda, who were nostalgic for that bad old-fashioned (sorta fictional) America, or simply political apathy.  (Some conservative voters stayed home while independent voters in many counties voted for the first time in a while.)\n\nIt's also true that racism itself is diverse; just look at the rainbow of hate in /r/worldnews.  But there is a disparity in the damage that anti-minority nativist hate in the White House can do and a black separatist (as well a bit more foundation in experience).
How dare you insult our Queen.
Is there a middle-aged version of /r/madlads?\n
There never was a national election for fear Ho would win them but on the other hand, he started killing tens of thousands of internal dissidents right off the bat in North Vietnam so the "democratic" appellation doesn't really apply.

Most states don't have civics courses and even if they do, not to the extent of understanding parliamentary procedure and pushing for a specific policy agenda.

Do you think that effect is blunted now that we have technology which can almost instantly render every minute shade of color on a HD screen?
With the ground, sure but I was under the (maybe mistaken) impression that older planes could hit the water with the occupants surviving while a modern one going down at 500 MPH would most likely not.
Well...that escalated quickly.
I'm not sure why the textbook discards the term "developing country" either as it wasn't really that inflammatory and was used often in academic work by economists.  
If it's not as extreme, then it's not the same type of bias in part because of who gets to be in control to do actual damage based on that bias.  \n\nThere's a big difference between BLM saying that police officers have institutional bias which is substantiated in multiple DoJ reports and Trump claiming a conspiracy of millions of undocumented votes or terrorist refugees with absolutely zero foundation in fact for either.\n\nI'm sure there's anti-white sentiment somewhere in the left but it's not the core of a platform or policy agenda.  Obama played it centrist as hell and Sanders never threw out prejudiced statements either so that see-saw isn't even.
The ones who display the Confederate and Nazi flag together do tend to fall in one end of the political spectrum.  Also nothing the Black Panthers or BLM have ever done comes close to what either of those flags mean or supporting those flags mean.
ISIS has also apparently been using drones for psychological warfare, scouting for later attacks, and even small scale airstrikes.\n\nLink: http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4b36e6f9ed814880ab56a1763060759d/using-drones-other-innovating-tactics-deadly-effect

The Democratic party, as it exists today, is not capable of challenging the GOP. You can't win being Republican Lite. 
This is ridiculous. Having a law that is legal by state law and still unlawful under federal law is just asking the public to out themselves for "special treatment" by the federal government. Obama said "we have bigger fish to fry". I believe this is true. I'm concerned about a rising McCarthy type attitude in America. We are long past the point marijuana should have been legalized federally. This is being used as both a hook to be able to selectively harass users and as a Red Herring to draw citizens attention away from the true problems America is facing.
Wait, I thought these guys were all about state rights and letting the states decide. I guess that's just for small issues, like guns, abortions, and bathrooms.

There's a sense of humor and then there is a total lack of disregard for people. It is never ok to pose with someone who has died and get your buddy to take a picture of you and the deceased like he is a trophy he just bagged.

Awareness and spreading the word is a start. Writing your government officials is another step. I hear people saying that's too small. That won't help. Change has to start somewhere, usually with small steps. Don't give up. 
That is a very good question. I wish someone would address a better way of hiring the right person to be a cop. If they later become unsuitable through excessive force or other shady behavior they should be moved to a different capacity or if the act is very bad they should be let go.

"That might be their only lunch break" WTF? Are there people out ther that get more than one lunch break in their work day? Even when I worked 10 hour shifts there was only one if you could manage to take it. I want a LPT on getting more than one lunch break!
To be fair I have experienced rudeness and prejudice from doctors and don't really have a satisfactory way to address it. Maybe we could just all learn to be civil to one another.
Duncan Hicks captured an encounter on his cellphone while trying to file a report inside the station. Now the sheriff says his deputy was out of line.  The video of the police is shocking.

You are SO lucky to have a Grandma who loves and wants to be with you. Give her a hug for me.
That was one of the options I listed - and one that they could have taken by ignoring it in the first place.
If that were true, it never would have gotten a response, and it certainly wouldn't have been sent to the Justices for Conference.                                         \n\nI'm not saying that the odds are good, but the fact that it got this far is astounding.                         
It was denied by a Federal Court, which is when they filed a [Writ of Mandamus](http://shannonfisher.com/wordpress1/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SCOTUS-Writ-of-Mandamus.pdf) with the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court literally receives thousands of these a year, and ignores 99%.\nBy not ignoring it, it gains traction.                                                   \nNow, the options are for the court to decide in Conference that it's without basis and kill it, decide it is with basis and send it to the full court Oral Arguments, or they can refer it back to the original court for a new decision.  If they choose the third option, then how it proceeds from there (summary judgment or actual hearing) will depend entirely on the wording of the Court's opinion that sent it back down.                                                                 \n\nPersonal Opinion: It will require 4 judges to approve it for full court Oral Arguments.  The only way I see them accepting it for full court Oral Arguments is if the Conference gets more than 4 judges to agree, or the 4 that do agree cross party lines.  Even then it wouldn't end up before the Court until after October - and likely not until 2018.  Since I really don't expect that to happen, I'm giving 70/30 odds between kill it and refer it back to a lower court for full arguments.  I think that the most unlikely thing to happen will be 5+ judges agreeing with the case outright at Conference and deciding it there.  I'll probably win Powerball before that happens.
That what I mean... there's only *one* option.
Actually, I believe that because it is an "original jurisdiction" case, no one has even looked at it. "Original jurisdiction" is from the language of he Constitution... by definition, the only court this type of can case be heard in is the Supremes. No other court has even seen this "writ". It can *only* be filed with the high court. So, it hasn't "got this far". No district or appellate court has even had a whiff of this one. This is going to die a quick and ignominious death.  
This is DOA and headed for the circular filing drawer.
I am no lawyer, but as I understand it, the appellate decision was in reference to a 'stay' of the inauguration, and not on the merits of the voiding of the election. I don't think the appellate court would have the power to hear it on the merit, with the Supreme Court having 'original jurisdiction'. Correct me if I am misunderstanding the process, but it sounds to me like the appellate court smacked this down before even hearing the merits overall, by denying the stay.\n\nNevertheless:\n\n> Now, the options are\n\nThis is where I think you're being overly optimistic... There really aren't any options. The Supremes will torch this puppy on sight.

That means his comments didn't piss off DNC members as much as everyone thinks and anyone bitching about Establishment Democrats controlling things is just trying to stir the pot                          \nor                           \n2. <conspiracy theory> He was an establishment plant the whole time.                                              \n
He's military.  He DID fire back: the Commander in Chief made a statement, and the Air Force didn't back him.  That's the only way that he can respond.
/r/SandersForPresident\n                 \nNow downvoting Bernie Sanders.          \nSeriously?
CSPAN has it scheduled for 4 hours (until 2pm Eastern)\nThat includes the Goodbye remarks from the outgoing Chair.\nI'm betting that we're down to 2 candidates within 3 rounds... so if I had to guess I would say 12:30 at the latest.  Whether it takes that long or longer...... that depends on which report you believe.                                                  \n\nWe'll have a much better idea of timeline after round 1 voting.  If Ellison & Perez are close, it will take a while.  If 1 is way up, it will be much faster.

I couldn't get a job for 2 years because I was either "over qualified" (they were worried I'd jump ship at a better offer), or because I was perfect for except they were looking for someone "more mature" (aka, older, because age discrimination is only illegal against the elderly).    \nI sold plasma 2 days a week, for 11 months until I got sick and couldn't any more.
If logic worked, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in now.\n

Don't do plasma, the money is crap (as evidenced by the OP).  Look at medical research studies.  Healthy patients get anywhere from $1000 - $2500 a week (average is $1000- $1500).  
I get them deleted for using copy and paste - because you also can't use all capitals or the word "Breaking" in the title.
DAPL and the fact that the camps were cleared out yesterday combined with the fact that President Trump took personal action to approve both DAPL & Keystone XL among a vocal opposition.\n\nThis incident will be quoted in dozens of anti-DAPL stories.
Yeah.  He did better than I expected.                            \nI think it would have been an excellent endorsement speech, but not sure it's going to do much good for his candidacy.
I don't think anyone expects anything less out of the White House right now (well, maybe delusional people who believe in the Bowling Green Massacre) 
A LOT pissed right now - because a buddy on active duty stationed in Texas had his wife picked up by ICE.

You mean "if you want to fish"?\n\nI just read the law, and people who aren't fishing don't need one. \n\nThis is an issue for your rep. However, other than the pile of exemptions already in place plus the lifetime tag, the funds from hinting and fishing licensing go directly to the Department of Fish and Wildlife and made up 56% of its budget in 2013.  Without a hefty donation of some equally acceptable funding source, the state is unlikely to gut that much income just to make it up somewhere else.

Macroeconomics deals with the large scale economics.  So, what you're looking for is to take well established research on how higher education leads to                              \n\n1. A larger earning potential\n\n2. Better quality of life\n\n3. Improved health\n\nYou need to combine this with the macroeconomies of places that have free college education available - like Israel.  Their economy is driven by scientific advances, despite the fact that more than half of their budget is eaten up by the military. Despite the fact that their progressive tax brackets go up to 50% rate and their companies are subject to worldwide profits (preventing Inversion), they still have a significant number of successful startups.
I'm not saying that he needs to take corporate money.                             \nI'm not saying that he can't vote progressive.                         \nI'm saying that in some areas, moderate Republicans are beaten by 20-30% and Dems get slaughtered.                           \nI would love a Progressive to take out my Rep, but I'd vote for ANYONE more left than he is - including a Republican - but the only person who came close ran to his right in the primaries a few years ago.

Thank you.  Updated with vote counts for each.
How fast can you type up information on 5600+ ballots that have hand written names and were signed (using signatures, not block letters) by the people casting them?                                        \nI imagine that someone who's primary job is the inconsequential issues like the elections that are going on in Connecticut and the smaller local elections around the country is really dedicating 8 hours a day to this task
If they just phrased everything "the White House" or "White House Administration", and didn't even refer to him as "The President" either, he probably would blow an artery.  They could keep talking about what he's doing, but not use is oh-so important name or stroke his ego.
That actually fits Regular Breitbart readers
*PRISM*
For most companies, it's easier to get hired at a higher pay rate than to get a big jump like that.  Not saying it's not possible, just unlikely; most employers shoot for the 2.5%-5% range, and in most cases you'd end up negotiated down to $42 at best.\n\nI would start the job search, but DON'T use it as a threat or attempt to get higher pay - do it quietly.  If you think that it may be viable, ask for the $47, but get some non-cash alternatives in there to negotiate for in case they won't go that high.                                 \nSuggestions on non-cash alternatives:\n1. Extra week of Paid Time Off (vacation if you don't do PTO)\n\n2. Paid Parking Space if your lot charges, or transit pass for subway/ mass transit (that can save you a decent amount).\n\n3. Bump your 401(k) vesting into the next tier.\n\n4. Alternative office space (bigger, different location, or just getting an office from a cubical space)\n\n5. Stock options in publicly traded companies*\n\n*Most people think of this as a "senior executive" thing, but I got almost $5k in stock options at a company as a mid-level manager.  They were surprised I asked, but it allowed me to get a chunk of value above the highest amount they were willing to agree to.\n\n
We need to run people trials on meds, and it's a way to make money.  For the most part, it isn't as bad as it seems; I did one for a morphine patch, one for a liquid form of a current cancer pill since a lot of patients have trouble swallowing, and one for pill form of a child's IV medication that they wanted to make sure wasn't too harsh on the stomach before doing clinical trials on sick kids.  A lot of it is stuff most people wouldn't worry about taking, delivered in a different method than is currently approved.

That is under emergency conditions.  It's not normal day-to-day that most Americans live through.  The average in the US is 80-100 gallons a day.

Sorry for the double post, but I may have to eat my words.    \nIn the (less than) 24 hours since I left, anti-DNC posts have dropped to 1/5 and there isn't a single duplicate.

There is actually a growing coalition of Republicans who don't want Trump.  It will take working with the GOP if we want to get rid of him.
As a mod on a sub that isn't t_d: yes, quite a few of them post in other subs.  About 1% post legitimate topics of conversation (even if they disagree) - and I welcome them.  60% concern troll - staying just inside the rules, but derailing every conversation they touch.  The rest get immediate bans for overtly racist & sexist comments of the variety you find shouted at Aryan Brotherhood rallies.
Thank you very much for your post
They typically won't hire you without a combat arms job and at least 1 trip to the sandbox.  All the ones I know also want additional training - Airborne & Air Assault, Ranger, or Special Forces for Army, and at least E6.\n\nAfter that:                        \nOne of the groups has a training center South of San Antonio about an hour near my parent's ranch.  For them, everyone goes through 6 months of field conditions training, whether you were an 11 bang bang or a SEAL.
I removed 8 posts from 10 minutes in age to 11 hours.  They all had varying amounts of information and speculation.  By posting in this manner, we can add information to the original post as it comes in (like the links to the candidates pages & additional sources to view the proceedings)\n                                       \nAdditionally, having this as a Megathread means that - as much as we are concentrating on the DNC vote today - it won't overrun conversation on other issues in the news today: [Nationwide Protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/5tubgf/bernie_sanders_feb_25th_2017_nationwide_protest/), the [DHS Report about the travel ban](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRAVEL_BAN_INTELLIGENCE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-02-25-02-33-36) that says it's ineffective, the [White House Blocking News Organizations from Press a Briefing](http://fox6now.com/2017/02/24/white-house-blocks-news-organizations-from-press-briefing/), the fact that the [White House attempted to interfere with the FBI on Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/24/the-trump-white-house-just-inflicted-a-serious-wound-on-itself/), and other "minor" issues like civil liberties
I'm not trying to belittle the concept that I hope is behind the post - but to be blunt: I don't care that he voted for every one of Trump's picks.  As a Republican, I'm much more interested in where he votes *against* Trump and his party in general.  Do we post about *every* Republican who supported Trump's Cabinet picks?  My own Rep is Kevin Brady, and I live in Texas - I understand what it's like to have politicians do their damnedest to go against what people want.\n\nFlake is up for election next year, and Arizona polling from before the general shows that the state could be close in state-wide races.  I don't think this makes him special: *Any* area where we have the opportunity to flip the vote from GOP to Democratic should be taken.\n\nHowever, not everyone gets to vote in Arizona - and for those who don't, they do have their own elections to consider.  Just because someone lives in an area that is safely Democratic doesn't mean that they should ignore the actions or positions of those that represent them just because they have a (D) next to their name.  These voters have the opportunity to choose someone in their local Primary that better aligns with their values and moral code, and it isn't my place to tell them they should ignore that opportunity because a politician somewhere else is an ass.
I couldn't get a job for 2 years because I was either "over qualified" (they were worried I'd jump ship at a better offer), or because I was perfect for except they were looking for someone "more mature" (aka, older, because age discrimination is only illegal against the elderly).    \nI sold plasma 2 days a week, for 11 months until I got sick and couldn't any more.      \nWhile in the hospital, I learned about paid medical research studies.  Did that for about 7 months until I finally landed a job - mostly by pseudo-lying on my resume that I was currently employed as a Medic Assayer (fancy word for Guinea Pig).  Average pay was $1500/week. Average study was 4-6 weeks.  Then you have to take a few weeks - months depending on what they were testing.     \nI was lucky to live near a place that did this, and was healthy. Not everyone qualifies, and one guy had been homeless & begged enough bus money to go from Las Vegas to Austin, TX for a chance to do the studies.\n
I realized that about 10 minutes after

You know, they could:           \n1. Talk about it in the briefings he doesn't attend.                 \n2. Ask later if he likes the plan to be more aggressive.               \n3.

So, instead, what you do is make them look as stupid as they are.             \nTo me, this is the Pentagon's way of telling America that Trump is too incompetent to do his job.
Military logic: if you have an idiot for a boss, do your job in such a way that you can't be faulted for the quality of work, but everyone knows that the person in charge is an idiot.                    \nAfter all, what are they going to do, put you somewhere people are shooting at you?
Thank you.  Will add it to main post
If it goes to the full court, it would take a while before the case was actually heard before the full bench.  That would give Congress time to set up an investigation, and any results that they came up with would have a big impact on the case - regardless of those results

Alan Greenspan said the same thing in 1998 on a symposium on Income Inequality.  \n\nHe decided in 2014 that it was being used as a crutch to intentionally ignore or redirect attention away from the underlying problem.  This is a position also held by Christine Lagarde (Director of the IMF), Nobel recipient Paul Krugman, MacArthur grant recipients Emmanuel Saez & Raj Chetty, and even business leaders - of which Harvard produced a nice summary of in their Survey of US Competitiveness.    \n\n\n

> Right now the rich pay a larger portion of our tax revenues than at any other point in history. \n\nRight now, the rich also have the largest percentage of income (not just wealth) inequality since the 1920s - right before the Great Depression.    \n\n50% of US income is in Households with earnings higher than $100,000+ per year.  Even in a flat tax, they would be paying a larger portion of our tax revenues than the bottom 50% - so arguing that "the rich pay more" isn't exactly the whole story.  \n\n\nHowever, if you really want a breakdown:                 \n\nLess than $100,000 = 50% of income = 83% of households\n\n$100,000-$177,000 = 25% of income = 9% of households\n\n$177,000-$430,000 = 5% of income = 8% of households\n\n$430,000+ = 20% of income = 1% of households\n
I think that tax policy is one tool, and the easiest answer at this point in time.  In a perfect world, it isn't the only tool that would be used - or even the primary.  I also think that of the tax tools available, personal income tax in its current form is a relatively minor piece compared to inversions and capital gains loopholes.\n\nI'm an Economist by education (and an Auditor by trade).  I spend my days looking at policies and procedures, conducing root cause analysis, and developing the most efficient and economical methods to attain goals.  I love my job, and it's something that I do in my every day life and hobbies as well - including politics.  However, in my job we frequently have institutional factors that force a subprime solution as far as efficiency and costs, and in our current political climate the only solutions that we can reach will be less than optimal.  If I had free reign to restructure US revenue and social benefit programs, I would worry much less about personal income taxation.  However, I don't - and at this point in time, an adjustment to our current progressive tax structure is one of the best solutions that is likely to succeed. \n\n\n

Cool.  Now, you understand that the loss of manufacturing jobs in this country had nothing to do with politics or trade agreements, right?  It's technology and automation that destroyed those jobs.  There is nothing Trump can do to bring them back, and he knew that from the beginning.  Pretty much everything he campaigned on for the working class was bullshit.

Why such disdain?  I know some Paleo adherents can be a bit cult-like, but honestly what's wrong with a nutrition plan that recommends avoiding processed foods and chemicals, and encourages eating foods closer to their natural state?  \n\nIt's not like we have anywhere near 100% understanding of the biomechanics of human nutrition, we're talking about thousands of variables and cofactors that play a role in our health and no reliable way to isolate and experiment on them.  \n\nThe last 100 years have seen monumental changes in our food supply and a concurrent rise in obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.  Something is causing an epidemic of these diseases and we do not completely understand what.  Do you think it is harmful to avoid modern processed foods?  What benefit do they serve over the foods our ancestors ate for tens of thousands of years?
I believe it's possible, yes.  I think since the bookies generally shift their lines until they mirror the public expectation of true odds, you really just need a model that can beat the crowd.

Let's say two people are holding exactly the same amount of money in their wallets.  We aren't told the amount, it could be $5, $10, $137, whatever.  All we know is that each person's wallet has the same amount, so we could write that as \n\n(Person A's Money) = (Person B's Money)\n\nOr we can simplify by just using x and y to represent Person A's and Person B's money:\n\nx = y\n\nNow, knowing that each person has the exact same amount of money, what if we give person A an extra $10 - do they still have the same amount of money?\n\nIn other words, does x + 10 = y ?\n\nThe answer is obviously "no."  We know that x = y, so if we add $10 to x then x will no longer be equal to y.\n\nHow can we make sure the equal sign is still valid when we give $10 to person A?  We have to also give $10 to person B.  This way we know that:\n\nx = y \n\nAND\n\nx + 10 = y + 10.\n\nWhenever you are given an equation, you are being explicitly told that everything on the left side is equivalent to everything on the right side.  Just like our simple example, if you are going to make a change on one side of the equation, you absolutely have to make the identical change on the other side of the equation.  Otherwise, the equal sign is no longer valid.\n\nMake sense?
This may be sacrilege in this sub, but as much as I love my slowcooker, I always do beans in the pressure cooker.  You can take unsoaked beans from dry to fully cooked in about an hour and a half, including the time it takes to pressurize, cook, and depressurize.\n\nAs far as your question, a 10 minute boil should do the trick regardless of pre-soaking or not.  Of course, by the time  you do that and get them into the slow cooker you could have started the pressure cooker and not have an extra pot to clean... ;)

Thank you, this is a much more rational and informative response than the one I got from the other guy, even though you weren't specifically responding to me.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that the entire political spectrum has shifted right over the lat 50 years, and modern democrats look a lot more like Ronald Reagan than Jimmy Carter, but what do we do about it?  There is very little popular support for true progressive policies these days, and until we can change that it will be political suicide to run on a progressive platform.

Get yourself a cast iron skillet and do a Google search for Alton Brown's pan seared / oven finished method.  It's awesome, although it does tend to turn my kitchen smoke detector into a real asshole.\n\nTo grill, let the steaks come to room temperature for 30 minutes and then get your outdoor grill nice and hot.  (700+ degrees if it has a thermometer)  Salt and pepper both sides while they are warming up.  Put on the grill, turn the heat down to med/high and give them about 4-6 minutes per side, roughly 10 minutes of total cooking time per inch of thickness for medium.\n\nSounds like you have some pretty tender cuts, so I would just go with S&P and let the natural marbled flavor come through.  If you ever find yourself wanting to buy a cheaper cut, Emeril Lagasse has an amazing London Broil recipe on the foodt.com website that is my absolute favorite way to prepare steak.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: One more really cool tip about cooking/grilling meat of all kinds - the more done they are, the firmer they are to the touch.  Each time you take a piece of meat off the pan or grill, prod it with your tongs and notice how that level of doneness compares when you cut into it.  You'll learn over time to be able to tell rare, med/rare, med, med/well, and well done by touch alone and always know exactly when to stop.

If you really want to hold the wealthy accountable, then let them pay for their bloated military.

Bookmakers actually try to limit their exposure to the actual risk of a wager by balancing the amount of action on each side of the outcome.  Their profit comes from offering less than fair odds on each wager, not from predicting the outcome of each wager itself.  \n\nSo, for example, let's say there is a fight between equally talented UFC fighters and the bookmaker is offering 9:10 odds on each.  (You bet $10, they give you back your $10 plus $9 more if you win.)  If the fighters are truly equally talented, then the "correct" odds on this bet, the odds that would cause both sides to break even over time, should really be 10:10 (simplified to 1:1).  \n\nBy offering slightly lower than correct odds, the casino expects to keep 10% of every dollar they accept from the betting public, on average.  Some bets they will lose $0.90 and some they will keep the original bettor's $1, but over time this should end up being a net profit of $0.10 on every dollar bet.\n\nOn the first day the bet opens, they have $20,000 wagered on fighter A to win, and $10,000 wagered on fighter B.  This means they are exposed to losing their own money if fighter A wins, so what do they do?\n\nThey change the odds being offered on person A to only 3:10 instead of 9:10, making the bet far less attractive than fighter B's.    This will shift action towards fighter B, since betting on him has a more attractive payoff.  Now after the second day they find that they have $30,000 bet on fighter A and $30,000 bet on fighter and they have rebalanced their exposure to the outcome itself.  As new money is bet, they will continue to adjust the odds being offered to shift their exposure on the payout back to even.\n\nThis is a simplified example, but that's the sportsbook business in a nutshell.  
Agreed.  Also, Kansas City style for chicken and Memphis for Ribs.

No argument with any of that.  I just think that even if you take away all of the pseudoscience theories about lectins and gluten intolerance and all the other unprovable shit, it still makes plausible sense that avoiding modern foods could be beneficial to our health.\n\nOf course, that could all be totally unrelated, too.  Maybe the epidemic of all the diseases I mentioned is caused by something environmental, like industrial pollutants or something else that was introduced to the human ecosystem in the last 100 years and it has nothing to do with modern industrial foods.  \n

I'm making a  philosophical point, not arguing for policy.

It's funny because literal fascism *is* more left-wing, in some ways, than the rest of the Republican party (fascism is socially right-wing and fiscally semi-left-wing, a kind of corporate protectionism). That's how far this country has gone towards insanity - Trump is actually an improvement over the policies of the average Republican. Not by much of course, and most of it's just for show like his anti-free trade stance which is decades too late to preserve American jobs, or his 'infrastructure plan' which doesn't so much build infrastructure as embezzle tax dollars into the coffers of private construction firms.\n\nBut he's pretending to be more left-wing anyway, which is, amusingly, the *only* form of pretending to be decent Trump bothers to do.
Depends on if you're asking Jason Chaffetz or not. He has shown so little interest in Russia id be surprised if he could point it out in a map without Michael Flynn in the room. 
I think it depends on whether or not the public picks up on these news items and protests or if the scandals are allowed to fade into obscurity. I won't pretend to speak for the author, but I know that Trump supporters are ignoring it as "fake news" while Trump opponents are screaming their heads off of it. It's the rest of America that will decide if this actually becomes an issue.
> Both problems come together in a new story that ought to be huge news but will instead be relegated to legislative arcana.\n\n> Here is the story. The House of Representatives has refused to investigate either one of the two massive ongoing legal and ethical violations involving the Trump administration: President Trump’s opaque ties (financial and otherwise) to Russia, and his ongoing self-enrichment in office and violations of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause.\n\nOf course I completely agree that these are outrageous, but are they seriously claiming that these are "obscure?"
So now taxes *increase* jobs?\n\nWhich is it, Republicans?
No, it's not. \n\n
No. This has nothing to do with Trump and only causes further division. \n\n

Part ten typo: "it didn't deterred him" \n\nOther than that, pretty cool
Literally 15 minutes west is complete greenery, state parks, and tolerable traffic. Chesco isn't defined by kop's materialism
Mum's the word
Awesome to hear man!! He's my real brother, not just my bro haha. And undoubtedly the best artist I've seen
Thanks!! Loving it more every day
Looks like she shaves her face and legs but not her hands
Not that I know of, just leave a message with your position.
Live your life.. I just got back from there with about 40 mosquito bites to prove it and am still alive and well 
Use your hand, a brush, paint, and a scanner like a real artist
Hey there, I also just graduated so I do not have any "successful" places to look yet but here is where I'm searching:\n\nAIGA\nBehance\nCareerBuilder\nLinkedIn\nCraigslist

"President Donald Trump's appointment of his senior adviser Steve Bannon as a member of his National Security Council's principals committee may require the approval of the Senate, but the appointment is so unusual the law regarding the Council has never been tested."\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-01-31/steve-bannon-on-national-security-council-may-require-senate-confirmation
Having nearly the same issue here as the boho gal..let me know if you come up with a solution!
thanks for the reply! I appreciate the intel and will definitely have to narrow down my main priorities. Can I ask what made you swap back to a Mac after a PC?
This is a great idea - thank you! I'm sure Best Buy has a return policy so I may go buy a PC to test one out
Jerry, could you please share with us your greatest inspiration for writing? I know you write every day, how do you decide which "topics about nothing" are worthy of stand-up??
Has this been confirmed? Please cite your source 
ironically this is how it started.. a nail in my proxes tire led to needing all 4 new ones! went with BS Driveguard RF and regretting it every day.. Will definitely keep an eye on tire pressure weekly
Only in Philly..
that's interesting! My MBP has no issues at home but my top of the line PC desktop at work is glitchy. It's also cheaper I assume so maybe that's the difference..
Flyers ent right here thanks to my SO
Thank you! By far my favorite place to get away
well shit..that's what I was planning on doing this weekend. There has to be something out there with a solid screen at a decent price!
JMU grad? I lived there for 5 years too and moved back to Philly 2 years ago. We usually visit every season since leaving :) Go dukes!
Having this problem too but can't seem to fix it. Sorry, but you're not alone!
Holy shit - thanks for this tip!! My right apparently can't compete with my left..who knew!
You are correct. This photo does not show all 360 degrees but the view itself was.

Cinnabon is in exton Sq mall if you've got the hunger
good tip - my laptop right now is huge so that's how it works for me but at work we have dual monitors which is a game changer..
This sounds more like an endorsement for tobacco 
I believe so.. as I have to get an oil change quite often, they check the tires and rotate every time under warranty
Behance always has tools listed at the bottom of the page. It lists a combination of acrylic paint, pencil, Photoshop, etc. Hope that helps!
Dude awesome! You're going to want to bring hand type into every project you do from now on. It's the most rewarding feeling in my opinion!
Thanks for confirming my suspicion!
Sorry, not too educated on cars here.. do you feel that the rims are too large for run-flats or something else?
They clear the voicemail midday apparently haha you got unlucky but call again later!
As a graphic designer, your response just made me squeal at work.
I have heard this advice from a couple of people and am definitely looking into it. wheels are so damn expensive but so is getting stranded at x y z locations.. thanks for your advice!
Awesome shot of SNP, which hike were you on?
Thanks!
Alright, Google Translate did the job for me. You are right in that this seems simply feng shui as told to me by a traditional Hungarian woman. Thanks again!
Not sure, I just saw it posted to a local news source this morning and figured it could use a bigger audience to actually make a difference. Worth a shot for only one phone call
URGENT ACTION:\n\nThe Senate Committee on Homeland Security is inviting comment and COUNTING CALLS before it decides whether to approve Steve Bannon’s appointment to the National Security Council. \nCall 202-224-4751. (You don’t have to talk to anyone, it goes right to voicemail)\n\nJust say: "Hi my name is _________. I am from ________ [give your state] and am an American citizen. I oppose Steve Bannon being confirmed to sit on our National Security Council."
Thanks for your advice on brands..much appreciated! they are 18"s I am concluding.. I had Proxes on them for 3 years before these Bridgestone so I am thinking you might be right about BS and FS. Looking into toyo, yokohama and kumho now!\n\nedit..I really just need someone else to handle this shit.. proxes are toyo whaddya know. going back to toyo then!
Totally agree that they make it seamless and enjoyable! However, I have a Samsung phone so the features don't all apply to me. I'm going to keep searching for a PC that is comparable to the Mac in graphics without the hefty price tag. Thanks for the reply!
What you can do is look through designer's portfolios and click "Hire me!" for someone you want to hire!
This is not a typo and I am not a mechanic ha - is it abnormal for them to be slightly smaller than the rim?
Awesome work! 
BEER SALES\n\nThe sale of beer at convenience stores, which had previously begun as a result of court rulings, is now covered by state law.\n\nMaybe I missed another announcement about beer sale at convenience stores, but will this be allowed now? Can I finally get a beer at Wawa like I used to do in Virginia?
Red Rocket is the best in the city, professionally rated so as well. Top notch facility, clean and professional with the quality artwork to support it. Adam is a great artist along with Erica, Vin, and the owner Mike
Awesome info.. thanks for your help! Must be 18" then and everyone can rest easy tonight. Clearly I came on here for Qs I am not educated on.. thanks again
This is what she was saying too, I think. Thanks!
This is Bearfence, the 1 mile loop with a rock scramble and 360° view\n\nEdit: here's the link\nhttp://www.nps.gov/shen/bearfence.htm
I get your point - sometimes it's worth weighing your options when hiring for design work! Especially something so particular like cartoon illustrations. Thanks for the discussion!
This is awesome! Thanks!
Came here to say this
Thanks for the advice! much appreciated
Only during certain times. I waited until after 4 pm to enter for free. 
Of course! Always willing to talk tats though my brother holds all the knowledge. Best of luck next Tuesday, hope to see it on the feed afterwards! 
Probably not
Yep a combo of pot holes, water drains, and cracks in the highways did me in.. hard to control all of those things as you can imagine. measurements are accurate in my post
Some dingus on another sub claims he called and confirmed that they're accepting calls. Be a good dingus and call to confirm yourself!
Philadelphia.. driving like a normal person on complete shit roads. Visit here then try to avoid them all!
agreed about the screen - that's a key feature I'm going to need. Never had a personal PC before though, so I'll have to sit in Best Buy for a few hours testing that shit out
Awesome series!
Yes. http://m.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/3/1629729/-Senate-Committee-now-taking-calls-on-Bannon-s-appointment-to-Security-Council-Here-s-contact-info
If most people here have dribbble then the same people will see it. Reddit isn't some secret society where once posted it must remain here. If the OP is looking to get a job done, there are endless resources to getting it done and I provided him with a link just to one of them.
agreed.
Sadly, I highly doubt a progressive Muslim will be able to win. For a progressive to realistically win, you'd need to whip up a lot of blue collar votes. Unfortunately, the Muslim aspect will make that more difficult.
I've heard his views on military action in Libya were similar to Obama and Clinton. \n\nNot quite as progressive as Bernie.
I would rather see Al Franken run. He's a great progressive, funny, charming and down to earth. 
The guy is barely winning DNC Chair, for Pete's sake. \n\nLet's focus on winning some school board elections first. 
I'm not really sure why that's relevant to anything I am talking about, to be honest.
I simply do not understand how you can kill a five year old child, and especially your child. \n\nI think, all in all, I have decent enough empathy. I understand why some people steal, I strongly disagree with racism but get how a lack of experience/education can produce it. Blah blah.\n\nI cannot in any way fathom why you'd kill an innocent child like this.
How can YOU not understand any of this? It's not more expensive unless your buying gold flacked fucking meat. More time? Probably not, unless you get an empty subway and don't have to wait in line. Yes, it is more work, I've already embraced that, but it's such a marginal amount of work that anyone crying about it is LAZY. How do you not understand that?\n\nI mean, are you really trying to get into arguments with people when you are so lazy you can't even accomplish a life task as basic as making a sandwich? 
Publix is quite solid. I usually don't order subs but when I was in the south and in a hurry I would order Publix (online, ahead of time so I could pick it up)
Oh for sure. He is crying because *he* is going to jail. At this point, I doubt he's all that sorry for what he did, he's just terrified of going to jail.
I've never understood how prolonged solitary confinement doesn't count as cruel and unusual punishment. 
You can DEFINITELY make better subs at home. I am always astounded at how bad people are at cooking. A cut and paste from another person who can't make better food.\n\nA) buy better ingredients. If nothing else, go invest in some boar's head meats, though if you can find a local premium deli you'll get better ingredients for less. Also buy good bread, there are many bakeries out there.\n\nThe secret to making restaurant quality food largely comes down to buying restaurant quality, or in this case better, ingredients.\n\nB) it's a lot more work. Holy lazy fuck?\n\nI mean, it's a sandwich. Alls you are doing is assembling \ningredients. That's it. I'm sorry, I know I am going to sound like an ass, but anyone who can't make a better sandwich than subway is challenged at life. Anyone who is too lazy to make a sandwich? God help you.\n\nAgain, I am sorry, but...........
Yawn.
I like this. I like this very much.
believe it or not, this takes about as much effort as making a sandwich... meaning pretty much none at all :/
LOL, A) the fact that you're even trying to judge someone's intelligence off of a few reddit comments points hints at how dumb you likely are.\n\nAs to your second point, I suggest you go work on your basic reading comprehension. No where do I imply anything that you seem to be implying I said. You also failed to grasp the basic points I was getting at.\n\nI'd work on those basic reading & thinking skills before you start trying to imply that other people are dumb. 
OMG, you made a sandwich! I am so fucking proud of you. You're still wrong about prices, etc. and clearly don't know how basic economics work, but fuck it dude or dudette, you can make a sandwich, and damn it I am PROUD!
True. 
I like how you think 120 is something to aspire to.\n\n*also common sense is relative* Yeah, that was kind of the point, but hey I am glad you picked up on that. A bit sad that you thought it was note worthy to point out, but hey you're advancing.\n\n*unless you go to a baseball game* I end up at a lot of different events/situations with people of different educational levels, personal interests, etc. In terms of natural "groupings" these people are often quite different, and yet I have rarely met people as flat out stupid as what was posted above. 
How in god's name is anyone getting "puppy mill" from this video? Some Redditors are just flat out stupid AF. 
excellent point.
I agree, but would also decriminalize meth use. Focus on treatment, and recognize drug addiction for what it is: a health problem. \n\nMeth dealers, on the other hand, arrest them and throw them in jail.
I'm okay with this driver losing his right to drive for life. Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with you?
Except GASP you're making that GASP arbitrary distinction. It's called life, you can live it.\n\nYou guys are turning sandwiches into mountains. Hilarious.
shrug a lot of fast food places offer salads now don't hey or did they stop?
apparently, they are hurting you son. 
Man that sucks, you emerge from a bunker and find yourself in "communist" eastern europe. 
LOL. hope she had fun. Good on the cops for helping her out.
You sound mentally disturbed. First, shut up and come back to reality, the initial premise that started all these tangents was from people whining that they **couldn't** make sandwiches as good as subway.\n\nSecond, when you stop eating out (I eat out once a month. At first because of costs, now primarily because I can cook better than 9/10 restaurants) and you start buying that *whole* onion and *whole* bell pepper, you'd be shocked out quickly you can use those ingredients.\n\nBut again, I get it, you're helpless, you need someone else to feed you. Cool. 
Most Democrats I know aren't rushing out to hand out abortions like candy, they also don't want to restrict a woman's choice, and B) recognize that many of those babies will be born into broken homes and not given a real chance to survive. Hand out birth control like candy, however, and you can avoid most abortions.\n\nFirst amendment is about freedom, not restricting freedom. "Religious freedom" bills don't seek to increase freedom, they seek to restrict it. \n\nWhere democrats are hypocrites is corporate money. They hate big businesses, expect the big businesses that give them money. 
for sure.
I understand that. Still 13 years when no one was physically hurt is a long time. Don't get me wrong, any reduction in sentence would be contingent on genuine reform. 
You and I have very, very different definitions of "fresh." \n\nFresh for me is going to a farmers market or reputable store and buying food that isn't canned and processed to mother hell. Most of their ingredients are loaded with preservatives to make sure that they stay "fresh". Hint, if your food is really fresh you won't have to use so many preservatives.
You know what scares me? If this same headline had been released under Obama it would have felt like a big deal. This story and Trump blaming Obama for the leaks are the biggest headlines, IMO, that I've seen yet today.\n\nAnd I am taking it as a relief. Like, "hey, this isn't so bad, we're off to an okay start today."
Ahhhh....... details please? What happened?
Honestly, on Facebook, Reddit, elsewhere I think that even a lot of Trump supporters are getting past the "honey moon" phase. Sure, they might still claim to support Trump, but few of them are going to be showing up to rallies, etc. going forward.
It's almost like children can learn to share........... \n\nDifferent generation I guess. Back in my day, while walking through blizzards up hill both ways, we kids had to share our consoles. 
The DNC is a bottom up structure. Honest question, how many peeps here are getting involved at your county level? If you're not, then you don't have a seat at the table and you won't have much of a voice.
This was probably the most common reply to my comment. And sigh, you are correct. They can have it both ways.
let's see him reschedule it first. Remember, his AG just said people who smoke weed are bad people.
I don't know. I want to believe that, and certainly in some jurisdictions it is true, but in others I'm not so convinced.
True.
I see the angle that she was trying to get at, but WOW talk about being tone deaf.
Look at you and your big ole Trump rally. Around here, they were saying "there are several of us! Several!"
It's the struggle that is fun, the sweaty palms when you realize your weapon could soon break. The first Resident Evil, for example, man that game always had me on the edge of my seat. Each bullet was precious. 
strangely though, a lot of poor whites vote for them even when GOP policies don't help.
true. makes me happy to see others as happy as she was.
Damn. Three bucks?! How does that happen? Where I am at they are 6 to 7 bucks and some change. 
best one I've seen yet!
that is silly
being a middle schooler certainly is a horrible phase, however, must of us go through it. You'll be okay.
The Marshall Plan is irrelevant for the above countries. Fiscal and trade deficits aren't the problem either. They are problems, for the record, just not the issue at stake here.\n
See, this is where you need to educate yourself. Most of the proposed gun regulations by democrats as of late have focused on the mentally ill, and various other "common sense" regulations to try to keep guns out of the hands of the "tiny percent".\n\nSame with letting migrants in. Democrats aren't saying "let known or likely terrorists in". They are against blanket bans.
his sentence is about twice as long, I believe. I'd be fine with her's being reduced a bit, again if she really makes progress and is rehabilitated.
You remember that manager's name? Honestly, the location and time is probably enough. Send a message to corporate, they'll probably talk to him.
But if I got a snickers I'd have to go through all the trouble of unwrapping it, then chewing it, then digesting it. That's just too difficult.
This was in the Netherlands, not the United States. If she was checking off an American style prison experience, she wouldn't be smiling and happy in that photo.
Seriously, that car has so much potential, but why did they design it with all the sex appeal of a mini van? I'm not a huge fan of Chevy's current design philosophy, but the Bolt is especially bad. 
You see, you're already explaining obvious things. You think you're getting into a deep conversation with fascinating insights, but you're actually not. You're reexplaining things that don't really need to be explained in the first place. \n\nHence, yawn. 
Your cold meats aren't "really good", sorry. You can easily buy higher quality meats from any decent deli. I guess we'd need to have a big taste test to prove it, but I just really don't see subway as having "really good" meats.
Ummmm....... the company was started in the USA?
If such organisms were created and lacked a brain, wouldn't that be better? No suffering, no pain, no anything. 
And it's flat out moronic for Walmart to not set a limit. One per customer. Shit's not hard. 
it's almost like those things can all be rolled up into daily life. I don't know, I don't need to clean my house every time I make a sandwich. I do have to wipe down my kitchen/ run and empty my dishwasher a few times a week, regardless of the number of sandwiches I make.  And it's almost like you can go shopping once a week to buy everything you need in about 30 minutes...... \n\nNow break that (very generous) 2 hours you spend cleaning/shopping out across multiple meals......\n\nIt seriously astounds me how helpless we humans are getting. Basic living is becoming too difficult for us. 
I don't understand why they can't at least pick a realistic number. If they said like 2020 or something, I'd be skeptical but would at least wonder. 
It doesn't But that's why your "this isn't the GOP platform" doesn't make sense. Publicly, small government is very much a central pillar of their platform.
Can't say I've been everywhere. Urbanization means most Americans now live in or near towns of 10K or more. Usually there is a decent amount of variety in these places. Most small towns I've lived and been in had a good number of local mom and pop places, but maybe I just got lucky
That's not the point at all, and I feel sorry for you embracing the conversation in that way. Genuinely, I just feel bad for you.\n\nPolice forces in the USA have a tendency to attract people who desire power for power's sake. Some cops want to be asshats, it's in their nature. This is a pretty well known phenomena. \n\nIn some Western European countries, police forces actively work to attract people with calm tempers, more well educated, etc.
Oh, it's better than a Leaf, yes. Still, I want Chevy to compete with Tesla, not the Leaf.
Their bread is pretty solid. You can find better bread at local bakeries, sure, but at least it's up to par.
Because Trump elsewhere has been suggesting a crackdown. The reason the politifact thing jumped to the top was because of Sessions and the administration's hints that they would enforce the law more strictly.
but here's what you're not thinking about. You can use those ingredients to GASP make other things. I don't know, maybe I am just a king among men, but I go to a grocery store twice a week or so, buy stuff to make fresh food, and GASP I end up eating 90% of what I buy, at least. \n\nMy food bill per week is probably $80 dollars tops. That's very generous. I know people who spend $200++ a week on food, whine that they have no money, and then complain they are too lazy to make food.
I remember when OoT came out and walking out in Hyrule field, man that felt bigger than Skyrim. Played it on 3DS a few years ago, and yeah, it's dinky now, but way back when.................
Morgan Freeman is my official documentary voice. Read this in his voice. It works.
Meh, I can enjoy some fast food from time to time.\n\nWhat bugs me most about subway is they pretend they aren't fast food with their Eat Fresh branding, but they are one of the worst fast food chains in terms of taste/quality/health.
..... no.... I'm sorry, it's so easy to find better deli meat. I mean, maybe I have been blessed in most areas I have lived, and you are in a different situation.\n\nIf I were to "grade" subway, I'd give them a C-, their deli meat is as good as most of the already cut and packaged stuff you find in a store, maybe a shade better. \n\nYou can go to most delis and find boarshead or something similar. I'd give those meats probably a "B" grade, a significant step up from Subway.\n\nI know a few local places where I can get A grade meat for relatively affordable prices.
The hypocrisy of the GOP platform is probably what infuriates me the most: small government! state rights! freedom! guns!\n\nuntil it's something they don't like, i.e. weed:\nRegulation! Jail! Big government legal system!\n\nMake up your minds, you can't have it both ways.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gilding kind stranger!
Right.... false equivocation to the max here.
As are you, I am sure.
I know right? I'm almost as edgy and bold as you. I'll keep trying!
Honestly, I just don't find Subway's food to be all that good. You can make much better sandwiches/subs at home, and in most areas you can probably find a better mom and pop shop, or regional chain.\n\nEverything tastes stale and flavorless. Their "eat fresh" slogan or whatever the hell it is is a laugh.
If I remember correctly, Edison was the head of a lab where a lot of people were working. Also, edison/his lab didn't invent the light bulb, just like Ford didn't invent the car. Edison and his lab produced the breakthroughs to make the economically reliable.\n\nBut that still doesn't change the fact that you are flat out wrong. Subway was started in Conneticut you asshat but an American entrepreneur. 
But the person above isn't just below average. The person above must (hopefully) be way, way, way below average. 
It's almost like you could take all of the half vegetables you're whining about and throw them into a salad...............\n\nAs for the work convenience factor, that was never the point. That's an entirely separate issue. So why you continue to prattle on about that is beyond me. Obviously if you are on work, or traveling, you can't make food at home. That's one thing. But to say that you can't make a sandwich at home or that it is such a difficult thing to do, is an entirely separate one.\n\nHow and why you are conflating them is rather fascinating. But hey, that's your thing. \n
Reddit keeps "breaking" so I don't know the context of this comment. However, the GOP loves to adopt libertarian ideals when it suits them (i.e. low taxes) but also discards them as soon as those ideals don't suit them (i.e. ending war on drugs).
taste and quality are to some extent subjective. Pretty much every sub chain I have been to has been better. Publix/ PotBelly's/Firehouse, he'll I'd probably give Jimmy John's the edge. Quality, you can easily buy better quality meats/vegetables yourself. Half of their ingredients lack flavor (esp. vegetables). \n\nHealth, I don't know if there are that many places better than them. But they aren't the saints they make themselves out to be either. Yo
Punishment wise, the length is spot on.\n\nRehabilitation wise, I hope they are given an opportunity to learn and to receive some mental help. You have to be mentally disturbed on some level to do something this bat shit stupid. \n\nI'd be fine with reducing their, or more specifically "his" sentence a bit if he shows genuine remorse, and is actually rehabilitated and can grow beyond being a racist piece of shit. 
I've yet to play Witcher. Not a huge gamer, but I loved Skyrim, and I loved the old Zelda games. 
Me too, and also a Link to the Past. That seemed like such a massive, albeit 2-D world. Your imagination really could make up the gap back then.\n\nI won't be getting BotW for a bit. I'm patient and always buy systems after there's a price drop or I can pick up a refurbished unit. I'd also like the game library to be a bit fuller. \n\nBut I look forward to playing when I do! 
It takes you 40 minutes to make a sandwich? ........... Wow.
Some cops are definitely nice, well intended people. Others are ass hats.
I still use my X230 for website building, everyday computing, gaming, etc. \n\nI use Linux, which might make a difference, I dunno. Windows computers used to suck after awhile because they needed a clean install to wipe off all the bloat. 
OMG, a stranger on reddit doesn't like me :'( 
I'd say just the opposite. It was the necessary and vital part. Book smarts is nice and well appreciated, but for forming basic relationships common sense goes a long way. I can be friends with people who don't share the same intellectual interests or curiosities as me, as long as they have common sense and they are decent people. I doubt I could stand people like "Red".
God damn it. Once it is seen it cannot be unseen. 
A) buy better ingredients. If nothing else, go invest in some boar's head, though if you can find a local premium deli you'll get better ingredients for less. Also buy good bread.\n\nThe secret to making restaurant quality food largely comes down to buying restaurant quality, or in this case better, ingredients.\n\nB) it's a lot more work. Holy lazy fuck?\n\nI mean, it's a sandwich. Alls you are doing is assembling ingredients. That's it. I'm sorry, I know I am going to sound like an ass, but anyone who can't make a better sandwich than subway is challenged at life. Anyone who is too lazy to make a sandwich? God help you.\n\nAgain, I am sorry, but...........
It's about getting the right quality ingredients and knowing how to balance them. When I see most people cook at home who don't know what they are doing, they just pile ingredients on and on and on. 
you poor thing. life is hard.
why don't you just sell that suit?
Longevity is a tricky thing. A computer can die at any point.\n\nIn terms of power, you're fine. Upgrade to 8GB of RAM and SSD and it will perform plenty well for just about anything short of 3-d modeling, advanced gaming.\n\nThe thing about most newer software.... it's designed to run through a browser or on your smartphone. Most software isn't getting all that much more intensive. Obviously, for games, professional applications that's not true. 
Slap yourself. Seriously. Slap yourself.\n\nIf you are so dumb that you are STILL trying to blame Obama, you need slaps.
I consciously try to use "humankind" rather than "mankind", and do similar things for other words...... and I still think this is dumb. 
Destroying a standing government and military is relatively easy and straight forward. Actual nation-building is near impossible. Two related but distinct things.
LOL, that's not a lot of extra work. And yes, you are being lazy. You are literally talking about 3 minutes of work. Five tops if you like a vegetable loaded sub.
