 loss. Did the big banks prosper due to fraud and collapsing the economy while others paid the price for their greed? Yes! Was it necessary for Obama and the Federal Reserve to cater to the wealthy with corporate bailouts, buying their defaulted risk and zero interest loans in order to keep the 50% of the retail sales attributed to the affluent to prop up a plutonomy version of an economy? Yes!\n\nDoes this make it a gray area in-between the "Dark Ages" and an "Economic Utopia"? Yes! Can the "Dark Ages" and an "Economic Utopia" exist at the same time? It did depending on who you were!
> And there are a lot of quests that require you to do nothing but play cards to complete them\n\nI love these.  I have to wonder what the other guy is thinking as I lay down Sigil after Sigil while my side is filled with 0/6 fliers and all my spells draw more sigils.
There are many variations of this sort of thing done for emphasis and style. It can be an effective way for the writer to inform the reader of...\n\n* A switch between the main plot and a subplot within the same chapter.\n\n* A change in time period, character, logic, or different actions that happen simultaneously.\n\nOr, simply a design technique to keep you reading, or to make it look dated as in you are reading a historical document.
See the [Law of Unintended Consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences) where there are unexpected unintended consequences of well-intended pragmatic thinking.\n\nFor example, the above Wikipedia page lists this:\n\n>In 2003, Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully sued Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for posting a photograph of her home online.[44] Before the lawsuit had been filed, only 6 people had downloaded the file, two of them Streisand's attorneys.[45] The lawsuit drew attention to the image, resulting in 420,000 people visiting the site.[46] The Streisand effect was named after this incident, describing when an attempt to censor or remove a certain piece of information instead draws attention to the material being suppressed, resulting in the material instead becoming widely known, reported on, and distributed.[47]
*John Adams* by David McCullough and that of his son *The Life of President John Quincy Adams* by John T. Morse. The father was a founding father who published about forming government, and the son was the most qualified person to ever be elected president and would go on to be one of the longest serving members of congress who broke the South's gag rule on slavery and to win the Supreme Court case involving the Amistad slaves.
Note my comment was about infrared film. Its not the camera but the film that records infrared images.
How did human population directly affect climate change? \n\n* By cutting down the Amazon rain forests and other forests humans have altered the climate via deforestation.\n\n* By trashing the oceans with plastic humans impacted the heat transfer between the ocean and atmosphere.\n\n* Developing the land for housing and roads, farming, overgrazing, strip mining and draining wet lands altered the land, irrigation projects, removed the trees and dried up lakes like the Aral Sea disaster.\n\n* Industrialization and automobiles added CO2.\n\n* Desertification through the overexploitation of soil through humankind's undertaking as in Lake Chad.\n\n\n
A few reasons:\n\n* Rich people are assumed to be successful, well educated, resourceful and have the right influential connections.\n\n* Because they have influential connections, they have the benefit of others like them to fund their campaigns and obtain appointed post that give them the government experience they need on various civic boards.\n\n* Organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations and the local and national Chamber of Commerce, which are business lobbying organizations where business and government leaders interact and form policy and results in the revolving door between business and government for elected officials who tend to become lobbyists when they leave government.\n\n* Influence pays, even a not so rich representative can become rich due to peddling influence and special favors. \n\n* Book deals based on their travels to Afghanistan at taxpayer expense under a supposedly valid reason for them to go there, and paid speeches they give.\n
Even average citizens work in politics. I was an elected common councilman while working full time as an art director for an ad agency. I served on seven committees. As for the type of person, that can range from:\n\n* Someone interested in making a difference.\n\n* Someone interested in helping others.\n\n* Power seekers.\n\n* Influence peddlers.\n\n* Employees of companies who seek to control government.\n\n* Someone who thinks politics will help in their private sector job.\n\n
There are all sorts of precedents about being president:\n\nJoin a club and make it known you want to run for club president and campaign for it. Its less costly, the prerequisites are fewer, and you won't owe as many people special favors to have to cow down too. Or, serve on some civic board and make it known you want to be it's president. Or, start a business and hold a majority of shares. \n
Strip malls and open-air malls seem to be doing just fine here in Central Florida despite the online competition, while the enclosed malls are dying fast. \n\n* People prefer the strip mall because it is a quick in and out on their way home from work and it is a constant reminder each time they pass it.\n\n* People prefer the open-air malls because they prefer being able to park close to the store of interest, can view their car in an unrestricted environment and don't have elevators, escalators or garages where you can get mugged. But not all open-air malls are successful, the medium sized one with the grocery store and gym is dying while the larger Waterford Lakes Town Center is doing much better because it has better visibility from the road as to what it has to offer than the smaller mall does. \n\n* People prefer being outdoors as much as possible and the open-air mall is like several smaller strip malls in one place where you don't have to drive to the next strip mall to get there.
You are some what stereotyping being homeless. Not all the homeless are homeless due to circumstances beyond their control. Some I have read about, are by choice, and not necessarily a bad choice when viewed from their perspective. Such as vets who don't fit in a non-military social environment. Not all of them are necessarily broke, or without resources, or without skills that would obtain them a good job. Skilled professionals have become homeless when their home was foreclosed on when laid off and had a hard time recovering a job due to their age.\n\nAs far as the permanent address is concerned, a mailing address such as a UPS store may qualify as a start if the homeless employee is able to convince the employer of his or her desire to become normal again, in order to mail the employee any information such as health care plans, status, whatever.
Don't I know that. But I was only 15 years old at the time and we were ordered to do it and we in those days did what our elders and our employers told us. Not much different than the Wells Fargo or Goldman Sachs employees did, and they didn't go to jail.
Write the president or your representative about any issue, what you eventually get back is a form letter from them (like those I got back from President Obama and Senator Nelson) that simply thanked me for my input without acknowledging what that input was. The letters even included promoting agendas of theirs and assumed my support of those other issues. However, that does mean your letter did not matter. For example, I wrote President Obama since he was looking for and advocating technology advancements in education. I emailed him via the gov.com site article on it about how the over 100 interactive maps of history and science I created enabled students to digitally experience history and science that they normally could not experience, go places they could not go. And how teachers could apply them on line and how well the maps were researched. Maps such as [famous explorer expeditions like Lewis and Clark]( http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-79), [ancient ruins](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-12), or the [topography of plate tectonics](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-128). Thus creating a self organized learning environment. (if you visit the maps, you need to select the appropriate map overlay for aerial or ocean)\n\nWithin days of my writing, the Executive Office of the President had shown up in my web site analytics twice, and in the following weeks various government departments such as Education, State, DoD, HUD, and even the UN had visited my site many times as well.\n\nThus, if what you have to say has some real value, it makes it past some assistant who gathers our comments and prioritizes them. Don't just complain, offer solutions, explain situations they need to be aware that had unintended consequences of pragmatic thinking.
Having created [this satellite map of mass whale strandings](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-122), and having researched the reasons why, trying to save the whales, while an honorable and caring thing to do, is a wasted effort because what drove them to beach themselves is so frightening to them it will only drive them to beach again several miles down coast. Sharks and killer whales, navy sonar and undersea earthquakes are among the reasons. \n\nFor more information on whale beaching check out [deafwhale.blogspot.com](http://deafwhale.blogspot.com/) 
Wikipedia would not have a "highly-toxic" problem if they simply monitored the edits before allowing them to be published live. No edit should ever make it live without prior review. And the editing would be far better if the monitor's input came during the editing process not after it. The Wikipedia monitors should act as much as a help in guiding the contributing editor write the edit, rather than acting as a cop or judge. From my own experience as a Wikipedia edit contributor, the monitors can be a bully as well and their policies are inconsistently applied where some allow external links to educational sites and others don't.   
It depends on the individual. The CEO I reported to controlled and owned multiple privately-owned companies while his son was president of one I worked for as marketing manager. The father had me involved with projects for multiple companies. However, the father just could not help from getting involved the daily operations of each company which placed me in a situation where the father and son each would tell me not to act on the others input without informing each of them. This was chaos, and while I was very successful, it was very difficult to deal with and caused me to leave the company after seven years with the firm. Since the son represented the future of the firm, I tended to favor him, but the father would put his foot down and intervene. So I had to placate both sides.
To the Trump supporters: Be careful of what you ask for because when you get it, you may not like the result. That being a huge tea-party like response that use the same tactics you used to obtain power.  What you spread around comes around again in a way you won't like. You taught them how a minority can take power from the majority. Now the centrist majority want it back

Black and White film has one emulsion, color film has three emulsions (RGB). \n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_emulsion):\n\n>Photographic emulsion is a fine suspension of insoluble light-sensitive crystals in a colloid sol, usually consisting of gelatin. The light-sensitive component is one or a mixture of silver halides: silver bromide, chloride and iodide. The gelatin is used as a permeable binder, allowing processing agents (e.g., developer, fixer, toners, etc.) in aqueous solution to enter the colloid without dislodging the crystals. Other polymer macromolecules are often blended,[citation needed] but gelatin has not been entirely replaced. The light-exposed crystals are reduced by the developer to black metallic silver particles that form the image. Colour films and papers have multiple layers of emulsion, made sensitive to different parts of the visible spectrum by different colour sensitizers, and incorporating different dye couplers which produce superimposed yellow, magenta and cyan dye images during development. Panchromatic black-and-white film also includes colour sensitizers, but as part of a single emulsion layer.\n\n>Most modern emulsions are "washed" to remove some of the reaction byproducts (potassium nitrate and excess salts). The "washing" or desalting step can be performed by ultrafiltration, dialysis, coagulation (using acylated gelatin), or a classic noodle washing method. Emulsion making also incorporates steps to increase sensitivity by using chemical sensitizing agents and sensitizing dyes.\n\nThe number of emulsions affects the quality and the volume of byproducts that had to be removed.

My son is a carpenter by trade and his first pick up when his started out was a new Ford Ranger. You can get a 2011 used for $10,000. Now that my son is well experienced and specializes in trim work on expensive homes, he moved on to a used Honda Odyssey mini van and took the back seats out in order to store his tools in a safer location than the pick up he had where is tools got stolen. It also means he is not the one to have to gt pick up plywood, etc. His tools are expensive and he had to factor in the cost of his stolen tools in the price of newer truck. He also factored in that buying a new vehicle at a higher price, only to beat it up on the job site, was a waste of money.
>What does georeferencing really mean?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia,\n\n>Georeferencing\n>To georeference means to associate something with locations in physical space. The term is commonly used in the geographic information systems field to describe the process of associating a physical map or raster image of a map with spatial locations.\n\nThus georeferencing can apply to things like the 160 satellite maps of history and science I made that plot such things as the routes of famous explorer expeditions such as [Lewis and Clark](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-79), the locations of [ancient ruins](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-12) that can be zoomed in on, the locations of [hydrothermal vents and cold seeps](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-126), and more.\n\nOnce the map loads, select the appropriate aerial map overlay to see the details.\n\n
Its speculation that the start up is going to be acquired because the technology is more valuable to the buyer of the start up than to the creator. The trend seems to be that the creator knows how to build a unique product that draws a big audience, but does not know how to monetize it. The buyer of the start up knows how to monetize it by merging it with other products.

Bull's-Eyes and Misfires: 50 Obscure People Whose Efforts Shaped the American Civil War .\n\nAccording to [Googdreads.com](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433598.Bull_s_Eyes_and_Misfires):\n\n>You don't have to know much about the Civil War to be familiar with Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Stonewall Jackson, or William Tecumseh Sherman. "Bull's-Eyes and Misfires," however, tells the fascinating stories of fifty largely unknown people who dramatically changed the course of the Civil War by their heroic efforts or bungling mistakes. Here are the stories of:\n\n>"Col. George Rains" who used his skill as a businessman to build a gunpowder factory in Augusta, Georgia that was impressive in its efficiency even by modern standards and manufactured nearly three million pounds of powder. The Confederacy lacked many things, but gunpowder was not one of them.\n\n>"Confederate Maj. John Barry "ordered the volley that wounded (and eventually killed) Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville. One can only speculate how the outcome of the War might have been different had Barry not accidentally shot his own general.\n\n>"Julia Grant," the wife of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, kept her husband sober and focused by just showing up and living near him before and after nearly every major battle. When she was not around, he drank out of loneliness. When she was around, his Army won battles.\n\n>"Gen. James Wolfe Ripley" hated waste so much that he refused to buy modern repeating weapons for the Union Army. He believed soldiers would fire without taking aim. His decision not to distribute superior weapons for at least a year delayed the end of the war.\n
Does net neutrality only consider ISP issues?\n\nHow is there true net neutrality when search engines control what you see and use when paid search gives priority, and algorithms I have seen in web site analytics restrict search access? 
According to [Pie Cubed article *How deep is the Sahara? and 6 more interesting facts about sand*](http://piecubed.co.uk/sand-facts/): \n\n>We don’t really know how deep the sand goes before the bedrock starts. One estimate gives the average depth of the sand to be approximately 150 metres while the top of the dunes can reach a height of 320 m from the bedrock (170-180 m high measured from ‘sand-level’).\n\n>Of course there could be cracks or fissures in the bedrock allowing sand to reach bigger depths but we just don’t know.  Sand dunes move (just like sea-waves in fact, more on that below) shifting the landscape. We know very little about the ocean floor and analysis of sandy depths is even more difficult.\n\nSo no one actually knows how much sand there is.
As this video of the [USS Triton](http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=video+of+submarine+launch&view=detail&mid=71FCEDFA27385156836771FCEDFA273851568367&FORM=VIRE) submarine launched lengthwise shows, not all ships are launched side ways.

That debt includes a significant amount of US treasury bonds purchased by investors that were used to loan the money to the government as part of its cash flow. At the same time, that cash flow ends up coming back to investors in the form of dividends or profits from investments in companies that were paid to provide services and goods to the government. So a smart investor benefits from both lending the government money and from the money the government spent involving the investor's other investments.

The two volume book is quite lengthy and very detailed. I color coded the map by book volume (blue for vol. 1 and yellow for vol. 2), the red diamonds are religious sites. They are color coded because the return route overlaps the previous locations. The red dot and star are the beginning and the end of the 14 year journey.  For the most part the information in each plotted point are a page referenced quote from the book to establish proof of having been there. Any religious information will need to be obtained from the book because the map was intended to function while reading the book. The exclamation mark symbols are information about how the book relates to the map. Unfortunately, there are some symbols in the map that relate to my former web site MyReadingMapped that no longer exists due to a technology problem with the way the maps were originally constructed as Google maps. Placing my maps on ClimateViewer 3D using a different technology gave my 160 maps in the education section more function and a more stable platform.\n\nEnjoy. The book was written many years before Marco Polo whose book is a less detailed variation of Xuanzang's book. And there is much that can be learned about the religion, people  and history of India.
Except the Dredd Scott case supreme court opinion says otherwise. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford#Opinion_of_the_Court):\n\nI am not in agreement with it, but the opinion does say the following...\n\n>The language of the Declaration of Independence is equally conclusive:\n\n>It begins by declaring that, 'when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them, a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.'\n\n>It then proceeds to say: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among them is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'\n\n>The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood. But it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration; for if the language, as understood in that day, would embrace them, the conduct of the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the principles they asserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal rebuke and reprobation.\n\n>Yet the men who framed this declaration were great men—high in literary acquirements—high in their sense of honor, and incapable of asserting principles inconsistent with those on which they were acting. They perfectly understood the meaning of the language they used, and how it would be understood by others; and they knew that it would not in any part of the civilized world be supposed to embrace the negro race, which, by common consent, had been excluded from civilized Governments and the family of nations, and doomed to slavery. They spoke and acted according to the then established doctrines and principles, and in the ordinary language of the day, and no one misunderstood them. The unhappy black race were separated from the white by indelible marks, and laws long before established, and were never thought of or spoken of except as property, and when the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection.\n\n\n
The problem is the willingness of local communities to push the burden of local obligations on the federal budget. Its like the intra state rail in Florida. Why was there federal money involved in a intercity rail that only serves central Florida? Over that last few decades, more and more infrastructure costs are being passed to the federal budget. Thus taxpayers in one state end up paying for some mine pollution in another when the mine went bankrupt to avoid its liability. Any time the local chamber of commerce wants to expand the local economy with an airport, bridge, rail or other infrastructure it turns to federal money. They want tax cuts on the local level and pass the cost to the federal government and then complain that federal intervention and taxes are a burden.
> Must there be some kind of constant to measure everything by? \n\nThe answer is both yes and no. Factors to consider:\n\nOn the up side we have Reserve currencies that enable corporations and central banks to make international transactions using a fairly stable currency.\n\nOn the down side we have:\n\n* Inflation and deflation.\n\n* Up and down economic cycles.\n\n* Debt repayment. \n\n* Market manipulation of the financial indices and credit rating agencies.\n\n* [Foreign exchange market intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_intervention) by government or central banks.\n\n* Arbitrage.\n\n* Business intervening in government to get government to intervene in business to the advantage of the politically influential business.\n\n* Fiat currency vs. gold standard.\n\n* But even commodity currencies like gold are mot stable as in the [gold price manipulation scheme]( http://investmentresearchdynamics.com/gold-manipulation-its-much-bigger-than-you-think)
They also do the following:\n\n* Market making where they create a market acquire the shares with the bank's money, promote interest in this new market in the media, and sell it to investors at a profit, some of which turned out to be highly risky and fraud.\n\n* They off loaded their risk on to investors by securitizing risky mortgage backed bundles.\n\n* In economic declines, they are how the wealth is redistributed from the middle class who sell at a loss to keep what they hope they can salvage while the wealthy scoop it up at a bargain.
I think we passed the point of stopping human-generated climate change from occurring. The melting Arctic and Antarctic ice cap will impact the Thermohaline Circulation of the ocean and a chain of climate changing events that will not be able to be stopped are coming.\n\nAs long as we insist on a constantly growing economy, the best we can do now is a band aid approach to slow it. Much of the damage (deforestation and desertification) was done centuries ago, but the Industrial Revolution escalated it at an even faster pace and turned local climate change problem into globalized climate change problem. The problem is that man has always thought of living life to the fullest now without concern for how the life to come will live.
The Judicial Checks and Balances are somewhat a perception rather than reality based on fairness. Appointed Supreme Court justices are confirmed by a Senate process the Anti-Federalists Brutus XVI called an aristocracy. Thus, the term for life of Supreme Court justices can be used to reflect the views of a minority as the last presidential election did when Senate leader Mitch McConnell refused to approve Obama's appointee, but will approve Trump's. Thus enabling a minority of the electorate (26%) to stack the court in their favor for decades to come. The Supreme Court structure does not accommodate that the largest block of the electorate (43%) are Independents or unaffiliated.
GOP VP Chaney was the driving force behind president Bush's actions. How do you know that Pense is not to Trump what Chaney was to Bush? 
There are as many different degrees of politics as one can imagine. And most of the terms used to describe them at misused. \n\nFor example the terms conservative and liberal are both applied politically different than the true definition. \n\nLiberal:\n>open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values;(of education) concerned mainly with broadening a person's general knowledge and experience, rather than with technical or professional training; (especially of an interpretation of a law) broadly construed or understood; not strictly literal or exact;  given, used, or occurring in generous amounts.\n\nConservative:\n> holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation, typically in relation to politics or religion; a person who is averse to change and holds to traditional values and attitudes, typically in relation to politics.\n\nYet a liberal can be a fiscal conservative holding government accountable, and a conservative as in a Rockefeller Republican can justify liberal policies when it built the national highway and various state universities. And conservatives enjoy the benefits of a liberal economy. The very people who hold that government and laws shouldn't intervene in people's lives use government and laws to restrict what others can and can't do. Both sides desire to create a purer community of their own values at the expense of the opposition. That is why the two political parties are each a minority of the electorate, but together they form the majority. The other 48% of the electorate feel marginalized by the chaos created by the two opposing groups who stalemate, obstruct and bully the marginalized.
Photoshop needed a way of distinguishing the difference between when your base layer is a color or photo image and a second transparent layer that overlaps the image below it.  The checkerboard background is shown when viewing only the transparent layer (not when the two layers are combined) and helps to identify that the background of the second layer is not the default white, and the grey and white checkerboard colors indicate that the background is not a solid color. Just like when an item in your menu on your computer is grayed out or the "Top level" message below the comment box in Reddit. Graying it out means it is not available, or of special interest to the user, thus the background is transparent.
This [white paper]( https://www.psba.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/psba-charter-white-paper-2009.pdf) by the Pennsylvania School Board Association on the charter schools in Pennsylvania states...\n\n> • For the most recent year analyzed (2007-08), there seems to be minimal statistical difference between the distribution of charter school performance overall to that of traditional public school performance overall. Traditional public schools, however, have a higher number of buildings making Adequate Yearly Progress, and have a lower percentage of buildings in corrective action at all levels. \n\n>• For all years analyzed, individual student performance by grade level of charter school students is significantly below that of traditional public school students. \n\n>• Cyber charter schools in Pennsylvania appear to be significantly underperforming both traditional public schools, as well as their “brick and mortar” charter school peers.\n\nThe tables in the Appendix prove economically disadvantaged kids served by charter schools in 2003-04 had:\n\n* a 3rd grade reading proficiency of 43% and a math proficiency of 45%.\n\n* a 5th grade reading proficiency of 32% and a math proficiency of 25%.\n\n* an 8th grade reading proficiency of 35% and a math proficiency of 20%.\n\nBy the year 2007-08 things got better with:\n\n* a 5th grade reading proficiency of 42% and a math proficiency of 49%.\n\n* an 8th grade reading proficiency of 62% and a math proficiency of 45%.\n\nSo it seems charter schools serving economically disadvantaged kids have taken many years for charter schools to reach the level of a public school. Thus charter schools are a case of be careful what you ask for, because when you get it, you may not like the unintended consequences of your well-intended pragmatic thinking.\n\n
Consider it like if you could briefly experience the weightlessness of space everyday would you do it? \n\nFor whales and dolphins its the reverse equivalent of when you dive under the water at the beach or lake. Some consider it play, but it is more like the thrill of a rollercoaster ride in that its a shock to your senses that leaves you wanting more. Immersing your entire body in a totally strange environment is exciting and fun. You get to go somewhere where you can briefly experience something that you normally could not full time. Thus it becomes a special treat you can reward yourself with anytime you get the chance to do it.
According to your linked valpo.edu article:\n\n>The Seventh Circuit sits alone in holding that undocumented noncitizens are among “the people” entitled to the Second Amendment right to bear arms.  The Fourth, Fifth, and Eight Circuit Courts of Appeals all have ruled against recognizing unauthorized noncitizens within the purview of “the people.” Is the rift from this controversial issue a prologue to a showdown before the Supreme Court to address which individuals possess this right and perhaps other rights that belong to “the people?”\n\nSo it is uncertain as to the outcome and it may get even more difficult with states like Florida applying Stand Your Ground laws to the criminals benefit.
Because as the economy grows, the need for more infrastructure grows and the cost to maintain the infrastructure grows. With corporations wanting to avoid pay taxes to support the infrastructure built to serve them, the volume of what we can afford to fix gets shoved onto a priority list that does not get enough funding and states and municipalities are passing a lot of that cost onto the federal government. Much of that infrastructure was built in rural areas with a low population. And some of the money was wasted via earmarks to generate short term employment on bridges to nowhere, airports for no one, roads for potential development that never happened. With a country the size of the United States and the size of it's economy, the volume of infrastructure (including parks) built since the 1950s, the volume of traffic exceeding capacity, and the aging of the systems, the cost exceeds our ability to fund it.

Wikipedia on [Time Perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception):\n\n>Time perception is a field of study within psychology and neuroscience that refers to the subjective experience of time, which is measured by someone's own perception of the duration of the indefinite and unfolding of events. The perceived time interval between two successive events is referred to as perceived duration. Another person's perception of time cannot be directly experienced or understood, but it can be objectively studied and inferred through a number of scientific experiments. Time perception is a construction of the brain that is manipulable and distortable under certain circumstances. These temporal illusions help to expose the underlying neural mechanisms of time perception.
Then check out [this interactive satellite map](http://climateviewer.org/3D/index.html?layersOn=mrm-105) that lets you zoom in close on the religious sites in India involved in Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang's pilgrimage back in 629 based on his two volume online book [*Si-Yu-Ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, by Hiuen Tsiang*](https://archive.org/details/siyukibuddhistre01hsuoft)\n\nOnce the map loads, you will need to select the aerial satellite base map to see the religious sites.
Take a look at the Small Business Administration's page on [Mining and Drilling Operations](https://www.sba.gov/managing-business/business-guides-industry/mining-drilling) to see the volume of regulations that apply and the volume of different agencies involved. Simply combining many of these would make it simpler to deal with. You don't have to sacrifice safety and the ecology in order to simplify the process to make it easier to start a business, but you do need t make it easier to comply. For example, as a marketing communications person, I created a dealer price list that was as much a training tool on how to order custom made shades as it was a price list. By making it easier to order shades, I increased sales. In part, I didn't need to find new customers as much as making us easier to do business with.\n\nThe problem with Congress is that its a legislature that has no accountability for the actions it takes and it does not have in the executive branch a single city manager type official to ensure its regulations and agencies it creates are easy to business with and that the agencies share their data between them.
However, the Tenth Amendment created a fourth branch of government, that being the state legislatures which cover anything not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAnd there is even a hidden fifth branch of government called corporate oligarchy's lobbyist whose influence greatly affects both the legislative and executive branches and may even influence the judicial branch via the lobbyist's lawyers and are protected under the Supreme Court's decision on Citizen United.

True, but the president has started already. Operation Wetback had something like a 5:1 deportation to self deportation and that was without the modern tools provided by laws and employer reporting.\n\nMy (humble) prediction is that the next step you will see will be employers facing criminal charges. Then more identity theft charges for illegal aliens using false identities to work. The president can do all of this without a drawn-out fight amendment fight in Congress and state houses.

You know that Milo would bring up the 1998 Maher discussion on Mary Kay Letourneau. Now that would be embarrassing.
He used the word 'boys', not the age of 13.\n\nHow many real pedophiles have you exposed? Milo has exposed 3.
\nIt is a general travel ban from selected countries. Not a refugee ban. Not a Muslim ban. Though, if the president wished to ban Muslims or refugees he certainly has the power to do so despite the opinions of the judiciary.

In my state hunting deer with .223 is illegal. Not enough power for clean kill. While I don't know if feral pigs are officially classified as dangerous game feral pigs are dangerous.

> Is Milo himself included in that 3? Or is he number 4?\n\nCannot count to three, I see. Unsurprising.\n\n> The law is probably about right, that’s probably roughly the right age. I think it’s probably about okay, but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger.\n\nIn case you need help reading for comprehension, Milo is speaking about himself and accepting the current laws for consent.\n\nAnd congratulations on citing Milo's definition of pedophilia. But I guess since it varies from yours in the slightest he is a monster to you. Too bad.\n
The corrupt old race whore just cannot keep embarrassing herself, can she.
""The crime rate has not skyrocketed," Azita Raji told CNN's Chris Cuomo, citing data showing a weak correlation between terrorism and the migrations."\n\nLOL. One thing is not like another in that sentence.
That is true. After all, the godfather of the left, George Soros, was a real Nazi and helped rob Jews. Kapos in the camps helped kill other Jews too.\n\nBut even this cunt didn't call Milo a Nazi because it would be too stupid for even a CNN newsreader. Apparently not too stupid for you  though.
You missed a bullet there, I know.\n\nHowever, I do suspect that in the face of rumors you might have thought twice before running bleach bit on the entire email archives :)
Socialism inexorably leads to authoritarianism of the "one man, one vote, one time" kind.\n\nWe are sorry for your family. Do you think the USA should invade? Do you think sanctions will do anything but punish the innocent even more? What is serious help?
When you are stealing shit that doesn't belong to you a jack-booted authoritarian state is de rigueur. 
At the 7:10 mark. \n\nI don't see how this is different from what Milo or Takai said either.\n\nWe can disagree with the sentiment without crucifying the speaker (unless the speaker is Milo, of course).
Strictly speaking liberalism refers to classical liberalism. But no one cares since liberalism now means socialism/progressivism to anyone speaking in modern society.\n\nNext up, 'cute'.
Nothing you can do but wait for the N Korean nuke headed your way. But at least the bomb will take out more enemies than Americans 
Do you really need to ask? The answer is neither, of course. Because Trump!

I demolished your argument and your misuse of the verb 'shall'. As did many, many commenters over the summer.\n\nThe Senate has refused to provide hearings on many Article II topics including judges in the past. And they will do so in the future. Scalia fully recognized this. You can believe what you want about how Justice Scalia might have thought about this step by the Senate but that is just mere speculation. Self-serving speculation, most likely.\n\nThe Senate did the right thing in refusing to consider Garland. And, given Scalia's deep concern over a Court that repeatedly short-circuited democracy by discovering previously unknown rights in the Constitution, I think the prospect of a jurist who respected both the natural rights origins of the Constitution and the actual text of the Constitution (as well as laws passed by Congress) would have pleased the justice.
Like eating raccoon or chucks, I suspect. As in "are you out of your mind?"\n\n
> I am sure that Scalia would have at least wanted Garland to have a hearing as opposed to be denied even that.\n\nNo, because there is no requirement for the Senate to give a hearing at all. Article II is clear that the Senate must advise and consent, that's all. And Scalia would have recognized that. The USA is not going to fall because the SCOTUS was short one justice for a year.\n\nTry again.
Ok. Then what? It isn't as if the world doesn't need yet another example of the failure of socialism.
Democrats have been registering illegals for years know that some will vote. Obama even encouraged illegals to vote in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRequire real ID that identifies citizenship status to register, vote, and pass TSA checkpoints. Everyone else can get screwed.
> try again ShariaBlue.\n\nWTF? Milo was pretty clear that sexually mature boys can, at least in his case, make sexual decisions for themselves regardless of official age of consent. That was not, in Milo's view, pedophilia. One can disagree with his definition of pedophilia while recognizing that laws are not made for the special cases but for the general population.\n
Didn't I see her on PornHub?
What is so confusing about looking to an outcome acceptable to both parties? Unless, of course, one party does not matter. Given that this is Reuters, the party that does not matter to them is Israel.
I'll add a couple of her songs to one of my workout mixes (I make the static). Not because she showed some real courage and chutzpah in wearing the Trump gown but because the songs are good. Wearing the Trump gown got me to pay attention to her.\n\n

Louder with Crowder did this about two years ago.\n\nI am still waiting for the lawsuits....
ROFL
The USA allows a million legal immigrants a year into the USA. This order has little to do with support for immigration and everything to do with border control. A country without borders is not a country; it is an undefended bank ready to be looted.
It doesn't matter. Find out who handed out the confidential information and lock them up for an extended visit at Club Fed. Offer deals to a few to walk up the chain of command--maybe it will lead to Obama.
Go ahead and implement JerryCare. It will turn out even worse than ObamaCare.
Utter nonsense. \n\n"He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court"\n\n'Shall' refers to the President, not the Senate. No obligation to the Senate to provide that advise/consent on any timeframe. Constitutionally there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Senate refusing to hold hearings on any appointment made by the president. Co-equal means just that.\n\nAny nomination by any president can be held up by the Senate for as long as the Senate chooses. The Senate chose to gamble on the outcome of the election and hope that the next nomination would not be a doctrinaire leftist jurist.\n\nScalia was much more concerned about the Judiciary taking over more and more of democratic deliberations that about a co-equal branch of government exercising it's prerogatives.\n\nYour argument is what has failed.
What a great way to encourage more voter fraud! OFA wants to talk to you!
No, they can't. Their minds are too small and narrow to conceive of anything else.
There is a video of him talking about it and how he thought it was acceptable. Not at all different than what Milo said.
<yawn> she lived. Maybe the bruising will teach her a lesson (but I doubt it).
So for saying the same things that both George Takai and Bill Maher have said Milo is now an unperson? That is a shame.
Not done right...again.\n\nJust how stupid does one have to be to want to try socialism again?
If Obama Democrats then yes. Time to put an end to the bureaucrats obstruction of the new President. \n\nOr sic the IRS on them. According to Obama that is just fine too.
Or "I know George Takai, and Milo, you are no George Takai"\n\nMilo should leave the discussions of pedophilia to George Takai, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Maher, and Bill Clinton.
How are Poland and Hungary doing vis a vis sexual assaults by refugees? Maybe those countries have a working strategy for minimizing sexual crimes. Maybe Sweden and Germany should consider implementing such a strategy.

Great news.\n\nNow we need good stories about helping people leave hate groups like the Nation of Islam or BLM.
\nMost are probably leftist trolls. Like the fake hate crimes reported over the last few months many (most?) of these idiotic posts are generated by false flag agitators.
> but the humanitarian crisis going on there is quite evident.\n\nAgreed. But just wringing our hands seems inadequate while people starve and are murdered.
Typical leftist tactics. Spend all tax revenues on subversive and/or symbolic programs and, when a real need arises for that tax revenue, plead penury.\n\nYou folks are just their human shields. California leftists would be just as happy if every one of you died. We recognize that. But how to stop rewarding the corrupt leftists by allowing them to steal money not only from you in California but the rest of the USA as well?
Planning on surviving on unicorn farts? 
Oh, bullshit. The good Justice would have recognized it as the usual balance of power exercise.
That was just another delusional fantasy made popular by Maxine 'scumbag' Waters. Never happened
Since money is fungible every penny given to California just means more money available to obstruct the federal government's enforcement of our immigration laws.\n\n
Who is she? Some leftist hooker?
How is this any different than what Milo stated? I disagree with both regarding sex between underage boys and men (or underage boys with women). Should Takai now be made an unperson as well?
Run them down
I bought a couple of her songs on iTunes to add to one of my workout mixes. I like to listen to pop/techno-pop sometimes when I lift.
which? The mob going after Milo or people finding extreme hypocrisy?\n\nMilo, for better or worse, does not characterize his experience as pedophilia (I think he is mistaken). Neither does Takai. Either both need to be celebrated by an auto-de-fé or neither of them should be.\n\nOf course by both of their definitions then female teachers having sex with adolescent boys should be legal since every adolescent boy I ever met would love to get into the pants of 'hot teacher'. And, if you were a straight adolescent boy, the definition of 'hot' tended to be.....very flexible.
So what is the problem? Seems perfectly reasonable
Well, not very stupid if you intend to be one of the leaders. They do extremely well. Isn't Chavez' daughter worth a billion or so?\n\nEveryone else supporting socialism, of course, has to be an absolute idiot. Might as well include unicorn farts in your economic plans.
Meetup makes money off organizers who depend upon people to sign up for their meetups. There are nearly 30 million people worldwide signed up as attendees. \n\nHow many lost attendees will enrage paying organizers? How many organizers will lose enough attendees to downgrade their organizer plans (there are two plans, I believe). How many new organizers will hold back signing up because their market does not want to be associated with Meetup?\n\nIt doesn't take much momentum loss to really affect company value. Successful investors care much more about equity return than political correctness.\n\nBig mistake.
Stupid?\n\nOnce is an accident, twice is a trend, three times is enemy action.
Pagliano is in Contempt of Congress for refusing to honor a Congressional subpoena to testify.

I don't get that.  I hope they do a good job and move the country in a positive direction.  We are Americans first, Democrats and Republicans somewhere down the line.  Don't bite on the vitriol about us vs. them.
I know this is old news, but I thought I'd throw this in here for a first-person perspective.  We have 2 children with peanut allergies and 3 sets of EpiPens each (1 for school, 1 for mom, 1 for dad) and they are all coming up for renewal (Nov 16).  We checked on the price and it's not the $608 from last year, it's...drum roll...$715 a pack.  That's $4290 retail.\n
And that makes me sad, but I don't hate you.  Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton aren't the problem, the fact that people jump directly to hate is the problem.
Can't listen, that site is Malware Warning blocked.
So you are going to kill him last?
I can get behind that, but how about the dude who uses it for solo exploration? (I assume that was the vision was for T3C, idk..before my time when they came out)
No, you get super frustrated after finding that didn't fix it and go drinking to forget about it.  2 months later some newbie dev asks why there was a hidden ^ U (or some other non-printing character) at the end of so and so line?  You look into it and it turns out that keeps the interpreter from functioning correctly on this, or the next line...or some such.\n\nYou have the fix, but there is no joy in logical problem solving.  You go drinking again.\n
I'm with you on that.  But I wonder what they can do?  They can't really T3D them, then they would destroy HACs like T3D did to AF.  Focus them on exploration and reduce combat ability?

Dreddit is recruiting
I'm not trying to bait, but I see this a lot.  Do you actually "hate" him, or just dislike him based on what you've read and seen?\n\nHate is a strong word.  I "hated" my old neighbor who ran an illegal cabinet shop while my children were very young and woke them up all the time.  I had to call the cops on him because "God told him to wood work" @ 5am.\n
There were good ones?\n\n(Besides the quotes from "On Deadly Ground")

I didn't know that, interesting.  Any source for info on that type of team?  I'd like to read about it and how they keep every 911 call from being "mental health".\n\nI still think the goal should be to keep the situations from happening, but you aren't going to have 100% success in that.\n\nPhasers on Stun sure would be handy.
Let's see:\n\n  - Left his firearm ON his desk while he was out of the office, check.\n\n  - Recorded office chatter and posted it on FB, check.\n\n  - On FB complaining about work, while supposed to be working, check.\n\n\n\nBut...lets blame it on the BLM tie, cause that'll grab traction.\n
that happens when you have a bonused hull.  Now, the 357.1% idk.
Interesting point and it has some merit.  I'm all for training.  As a counter-point, take your suggestion and flip the 1st/2nd Amendment aspect of it and see how it reads.  Universal licensing and background checks, safety course, license to join a rally/march for XYZ cause because statistics show that rally/marches have a higher incident of injury.
I read that as "Blow Jobs 4 Kids", was like...uhh, wut?
I'm not saying it isn't without merit.  I'm just noting that the people with space (direct or proxy) want nullification gone, the people without do not....in general.\n
Uff, unpossible.

I actually am interested in what makes people hate.  What they think it means and how it impacts people and who's peddling it.  \n\nI see hate much like the person down the thread said, as: Irrational anger.  Who does irrational anger/hate serve?  You, personally?  Your family?  Your country?\n\nSo, yes, I'm curious and pondering "hate" and its use.  And yes, I do have an agenda...but it's pretty benign: I want to explore who peddles it, who profits from it and what the currency is.
I'm not surprised at all.\n\nBack in high school (a LONG time ago) a close friend did a senior paper on the dangers of drinking vs smoking.  For the testing part we picked the popular game, Hangon!  One of us smoked up and the other drank some cold ones and played.  The next day or two we swapped poisons and did it again.  The results were plain to see...the smoker did much better with less flaming deaths.

Those things have to be strong, so parts would probably survive and make for quite a party along the path of landfall.  The interesting thing is that because it has to reach some equilibrium with respects to gravity.  That means you need to put your platform in geostationary orbit.  This platform was in low orbit, so that platform had to be exerting some pretty serious space wards thrust to keep it from falling down on it self.  Nevermind that lateral thrust to keep it from bending and falling down because you didn't put it where it is supposed to be.\n\n(Note: assuming a non-self supporting tether.  If it's build out of unobtanium and can say piss off to the forces, then maybe it'll just stay where it is.)\n

Thinking long game here: It may be possible that Witten won't lose any speed when he's still playing at 70 using a walker.
That's a valid point.  In my mind (and I'll be honest and say that it may not be anyone else's thought) voting is one of the core things that the state should sponsor, put on, and protect the sanctity of.  If the state sponsors busses with cookies, then cool.  It can't be a parking lot of busses and everyone is going to the purple bus this year because they are giving away the best PS4 games and $7 more than the green bus.  Sure, we can conjure up some slippery slope arguments for the current setup about cars and freedom of schedule, but until the state sponsors mobile (or online, or voting by toilet flushing) we have to stay with what we have.\n\nNow, the question I do have is that what the underlying impact of those who, I assume, are unlikely to vote (non-partisan here...I'm not red or blue).  Polling places aren't exactly far away in urban areas.  There is a long timeframe for early voting as well.  So my question is: Do we really want people who will not make the effort to vote*, voting?  The easy answer is: "Yes, we want everyone to vote!"...but do we really?\n\n(*) I'm not arguing about inaccessibility issues (no car, disabled, etc.)

Okay, well, sucks to be you then.\n\nI have hope and belief that we are more than Democrats and Republicans; we are Americans and we are defined by a single election, or one president.  We are defined by the body of our work.

I honestly don't know, but I do know that we've gutted our mental health system.  My guess is that's the first place to start.\n\n
I've watched this whole shit-show as an independent.  I find it interesting that in the days running up to the election there were a couple of articles in the press that Trump might win the popular vote, but would lose the EC.  Nobody seems to have cared.  It turns out that it was a 180 from that and the calls for change are flowing like mad.  Interesting to watch.\n\nNo, I think the founders knew exactly what they were doing and it wasn't based on a 4 year cycle, it was to pick a systems that worked in the vast majority of then current possibilities and was thought out to protect it in the future.

I'd be interested in seeing how simply lowering the security of all systems just a little bit would change the galaxy. Some LS space would become NS and some HS would become LS. Think of it like the polar caps melting, leaving a little less safe land. 
Haha, yeah. Something I read a from a fellow redditor made it really simple--you get healthy in the kitchen and fit in the gym. Being 35 yo at the time and having my dr tell me he was putting me on Lipitor if I didn't get my cholesterol down was a pretty solid reality check and motivator too. He seemed pretty impressed that I got it down almost 200 points (284-->87) with only diet and excercise within 6 months.

Oh absolutely. I was speaking from a pure numbers in vs numbers out perspective. I did something similar to you a few years back. I limited my caloric intake to 1600 calories a day, spread out all day, including eating a bit in the evening. All while maintaining a daily calisthenic exercise program(about 45 minutes). I lost 30 pounds in 7 weeks. I went from barely being able to do 10 push-ups and 10 sit-ups to a routine of 200 jumping jacks and 100 push-ups, sit-ups, leg-lifts and squat thrusts broken up into 5 sets. I was just getting my weight low enough to introduce pull ups into my routine when I had to stop because of a hernia repair, which was caused by a snowboarding accident a few years prior.
Well, to anyone born after 1995, especially casual observers and people who aren't normally space enthusiasts, the idea that there *arent* any exoplanets would seem silly.

 Id like to think that on that kind of scale, the military and veterans aren't going to be a non-factor. Given their oath, I'd put money on the men in green putting the boys in blue in their place, should they act out of line on a national scale. In my head I see it playing out [like this](https://youtu.be/HFgAKNyLONE), lol
maybe, but firing on citizens is a pretty clear line in the sand, especially with how quickly information spreads. southern poverty law center reported over 1000 militia groups as of 2013. i imagine if the government started making a legit transition to a dictatorship or attacking its own citizens( i doubt that will happen), then id expect to see those groups memberships rise really fast, especially the groups who arent extremeist hate groups and are really just trying to protect the laws of the constitution.

Oh god, this was in a explo site? MFW your targeting range is lower than your analyzer range...
The military I don't think overwhelmingly supports trump. I think their 'support for the administration' is somewhat confused with 'respect for the position'. Their oath is to the constitution first. I know too many military personel who wouldn't stand to see their families treated that way if orders came from the top down via LEOs. There a lot of different reasons why people choose to join the military, the majority being the love and defense of this country.

i think it really comes down to using the appropriate blend of both. i still dont feel like its ready for people yet. i went into Rogue one knowing Tarkin was CGI, so i just chalked up being critical of it knowing that. however i had never heard about the leia cameo and i instantly picked up on it being CGI. with tron legacy, it was pretty obvious with jeff bridges. i thought that it played well to clu's character, but not so much when it was the 'user's world'.

Given what we know about the planets in our solar system, I wonder if there are other planets whose orbits are long enough that they didn't transit during the observation period. Would that be possible?
Hi and awesome work! I'm curious, is it possible that the system may contain additional planets that didn't transit during the observation period because of a larger orbit?
I was wondering about the numbers on that one too. Could they be counting the people who simply use the Blue Ridge Parkway since it ends(or begins) at GSM?\n\nEither way, I think I'd drop everything I'm doing if I could get a job at American Samoa National Park!

The fucked up part is a lot of the people that buy this shit are the same ones that are denying Sandy Hook happened.
in my area, it doubled in price overnight(not really) it seemed. gas around me was at around $2.50 in 2007. in 2008 it was up to $4.50 gallon. it then it dropped back down almost as quickly as it went up. the cost of goods however did not go back down
Probably not. It'll be relegated to the list of other things we'll never do like circumnavigate the globe and have a man walking on the moon.
another example: where i live, the price of groceries went up by a pretty noticeable margin in 2008, because the cost of fuel had gone up substantially. when price of fuel saw a sharp decrease, do you think the price of groceries went down? oh, hell no, lol
While I get what you're saying, perhaps the people who didn't vote sent their message--"you want to drive this country further to left or right, then take the wheel and lets see where it goes" \n\nBoth sides of the aisle need to get their heads out of their asses. Perhaps instead of pandering to the extreme 20% on the left or right, they should consider shooting straight with the 60% in the middle.
> Is it really normal and healthy? Maybe it is. Maybe my viewpoint is distorted.\n\nmy wife has a pretty solid grasp on her behaviors(for the most part). that said, because im hyper aware of her condition, ive learned that sometimes *I* look a little too deep into her actions and that sometimes she is making a valid point but im being dismissive. bless her soul for being patient and pointing it out in an acceptable manner when im the one not listening.\n\n
It's be a short discussion, since it's pretty much everyone to some degree or another, whether on stage or 5 minute warm ups by yourself. Otherwise it's the equivalent of expecting someone to write a book without teaching them the alphabet or how to read.

Thanks, but I feel like that tool, though it might be accurate, seems a little wonky. Like, it's telling me 1 hedg, 1 pyro, 7 scord and then 10s of thousands of everything else, lol. If it had a checkbox next to each ore to either factor it or not factor it into the results, it would be perfect.
It's about sending a message to both parties putting forth unfavorable candidates. You guys wanna play partisan politics to pander to the extreme sides of your base, then you get what you deserve. This should be a lesson to any who put the extreme 10% on each side before the middle 80%.\n\nIn the future maybe all parties should try to put forth candidates that can get as many votes as possible from the country, instead of just their party.
These kinda comments are the real gems that make sifting through the sandy bullshit worth it.
There's always a guy who thinks the history of the NFL began with the release of Madden. But, if you're interested, [here's an older article on the evolution of the draft](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1077925-history-of-the-nfl-draft-how-has-the-process-evolved-over-time). It hasn't always been a super hyped process, and certainly not seen as valuable as it is today. \n\nIf you need an example of a specific team just not giving a fuck about the draft, [have a look at the redskins through the 70s, back when there were more rounds](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/was/draft.htm) You'll find often their first pick isn't until the 5th, or 8th, round. 
I mean, Denver won the Super Bowl a year ago with an UDFA at running back. It's not a difficult position to replace. Green Bay plugged a wide receiver back there when everyone up and died on their roster, still went to the NFC championship. 
Ditka came up in a different time, when the draft wasn't viewed as important, and certainly not hyped the way it is today. To a guy like him, trading away his draft for a 'great player' was worth it because fuck it, who else is he gonna bother with in the draft anyway?\n\nI'm not saying the draft doesn't matter, but I would suggest it's overly-hyped. Capping rookie wages has helped make it more important, but it's not the only source of talent. 
At the time he was cut, he couldn't throw the ball 20 yards. He never would have passed a trade physical. 
Often times, suicidal people have a bounce, where they seem happier and recovering from what worries them after they've made the decision to end their lives. This leads to a list of people who'll say "but he/she seemed so happy!" I wouldn't suggest this is an absolute, but it's common. 
At the moment, I DM 2 games and am a player in another 2.  I find DnD one of the funnest things you can do with a group of nerds that are into storytelling/acting.
I like those odds.
As a fan of both folk music and metal music, I have to say that he hit his mark with that.  It very much feels like a natural blend of both styles rather than either style picking up parts of the other.
A lot of it has to do with cultural pressure.  I know that as a fan of the Olympics, I have looked into why India is always so poorly represented despite being so big.  One answer is that the big sport there is cricket which isn't in the Olympics (and you also don't see played in the US much).  The other answer is that India as a country doesn't really see any importance in large scale organization for most sports.  They are seen as hobbies, not serious competitive ventures.\n\nFor the second one, China used to think the same way.  For a while, they didn't even bother sending a team to the Olympics.  However, at one point they realized that international sports could be a way for them to gain prestige as a country (something they were very interested in), now they are one of the biggest competitors.  India either hasn't come to that realization yet, or simply doesn't care.\n
None and being a swimmer.  It kind of pisses me off how much body hair I have and if I could I would just get rid of all of it forever.
One of my roommates is a stoner.  He is at the point that if he goes to class sober, people think there is something wrong with him.
He still has a few days left to get in under the Harrison record for shortest presidency.
Heavy shows are the only ones I find bingeable.  Any of the comedy shows fail to hold me for more than two or three episodes before I get distracted and go off to do something else, but shows with a thick and meaty story will have me glued to my computer from start to finish.
Taste has two major components to it, flavor and texture.  It is true that most Mexican food ends up with very similar flavors, but they often end up with radically different textures.\n\nFor example, tacos will often end up much crunchier than anything else.  Especially when hard shells are used (something that really can't with any other main dish).  Even when soft shells are used, they are commonly small and relatively crispy when compared to the larger and softer tortillas used for burritos and enchiladas.  Tacos also generally are not served with rice in them which radically changes the texture profile.  Rice has a very distinct texture that nothing else quite matches and the absence is notable and most other Mexican dishes are either commonly or universally served with rice.\n\nEmpanadas are also very crunchy, but they go about it in a different way.  While tacos will have a consistent crunch to both the outside and the inside of their shells, empanadas have a thin layer of crunchy on the outside while the inside is soft and blends naturally into the filling.  They also universally have melted cheese while tacos have solid cheese which forms a distinctly different texture.\n\nBurritos certainly have the most in common with tacos, but they usually end up a bit softer.  They never use hard shells and are never baked, so can never get close tot he crunch of a hard shell taco or the crisp of an empananda.  They also contain rice far more commonly than tacos, which, radically changes the texture profile.\n\nEnchiladas, meanwhile, go of to the other end of the spectrum from tacos and empanadas.  By being soaked in the sauce and then baked, they get very soggy.  Sometimes there is a bit of crisp at the edge where the tortilla poked above the sauce, but the bulk of the dish gets soft to the point that it can fall apart.  The end result has a texture much like that of a firm pudding pressed into shape rather than a distinct tortilla.\n\nI would also like to point out that I have never been to Mexico before and the Mexican food I am familiar with is either the shitty oversimplified Americanized Mexican food, or it is Tex-Mex that has as much in common with barbecue as it does Mexican food.  However, even with that limited experience I notice these distinct differences.
When I was assigned *The Giver* I was only supposed to read the first chapter for class the next day.  I ended up finishing the book before I went to bed that night.  The entire thing was great from start to finish.
I've read a lot of fanfiction and there are quite a few that I would list as favorites that I keep going back to.\n\nNumber one would have to be [The Spirit of Truth](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6693626/1/The-Spirit-of-Truth) and its much longer and meatier sequel [The Spirit of Redemption](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6735812/1/The-Spirit-of-Redemption).  Despite it being longer than almost every published book series out there, I have read the entire thing twice.  Both times it effectively reshaped reality for me and made me forget what was canon.  It is also one of the few works of fiction that has managed to bring me to tears.\n\nAnother is [I Am What I Am](https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16860/MMcGregor+I+Am+What+I+Am.htm).  I'm not sure how to describe what I like so much about this beyond it being an excellent character study of Xander.\n\nThen there is [The Dragon King's Temple](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple) which is an Avatar: The Last Airbender and Stargate crossover which describes both settings perfectly as they would appear through the eyes of characters from the other.  I hold it as the perfect example of how to write a crossover.\n\nI could probably go on all day listing out fics I loved.  If you'd like, you can name some story elements or fandoms you would like some recommendations for, and I can see if anything I have on my favorites list fits those.  I've read a pretty wide variety of fanfiction, including some fandoms that are relatively obscure.  The three I listed are all relatively serious fics, but I do also know some with a comedy focus, I just usually don't give them the edge for my absolute favorites (I generally enjoy my comedy more as something sprinkled into a serious story rather than just straight comedy).
[Bush averages at 5th worst with Nixon being a bit higher.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_results)  The real feat would be getting in under Buchanan.
I don't know for sure.  My knowledge is more in the vein of the environmental (from my education) and the economic (from living in coal country for a bit) impact that coal mines have.  I don't know all that much about the specifics of what goes on in a coal mine.  I just know that whatever goes on at a mine, it produces highly acidic and heavy metal laden water and if you throw that shit directly in a stream, that just means more of that acid and heavy metals ending up in the water table.
"I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us."  -Theodore Roosevelt\n\nHe was pretty passionate about conservation and had many quotes that covered the subject, but this is the one that I think most clearly explains my stance on the subject.  Among natural resource professionals today, he is often credited with being one of the most influential figures in the history of the field especially when it came to bridging the gap between the conservation and preservation schools of thought.  Personally, I intend to follow in the footsteps of his work in this area and I see that as the service that I am giving to my country.  Seeing quotes like this one and others like it fill me with a patriotic fervor to continue on my present course.
I don't get the fascination with that book.  I found it spectacularly boring.  Sure it had decent prose, but the story was about as interesting as watching paint dry.
Her story line is good, but she didn't get many chances to show off her acting.  Dolores is a pretty subtle character from an acting standpoint.  I'm hoping that with her off the rails now, she gets a bit more animated giving the actress more chances to show off her acting chops.
I think the WV economy probably rides off of coal more than any other state.  If coal went defunct overnight, in most states it would be a regional economic crisis, but in WV it would be pretty much the entire state.
Pro because it is possibly the greatest invention of modern medicine.
It would never work for me.  I am pretty much incapable of sleeping while vertical.
This was the only book I ever had to read in school that made me use SparkNotes.  Every other assigned read I was at least able to finish even if I didn't like it.  But *The Catcher in the Rye* gave me such a headache to read that I simply couldn't do it.  Something about the writing style or the character's voice just pissed me off.  I don't think I even made it through the first chapter before I gave up.
LOL\n\nThat chapter was actually my favorite in the book.  I could have gone for an entire novel that was just a bunch of whalers describing the animals they saw at sea and how they picked which whales to chase.
Texas (the southern end, Houston, El Paso, and Parts of Dallas), the "Black Belt" (which includes sections of Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina), Wyoming (Jackson Hole), South Dakota (the Pine Ridge Reservation), Arizona (Santa Cruz County).  If you want to go further than that, most cities trend Blue even in Red States so you have things like St. Louis and Kansas City going blue even if the rest of Missouri does not.\n\nThat doesn't even count the states that ended up being close battle grounds.  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Michigan, and Florida all could have gone the other way and even though the states went to Trump they all maintain solid areas that vote Democrat.  Hell, I bet if you held the election today he would not win all of those state.
That's the biggest one that comes to mind, but there are a bunch of little ones too.
No.  Land takes less energy to heat up in sunlight, but also loses that heat faster when the sunlight is gone.  So, while you see drastic changes in temperature in the middle of continents, at sea the temperature is relatively stable.  The hottest parts of the ocean don't get much above 80 degrees.
Here's a seven hour timelapse, from the crowd arriving until they start to leave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdantUf5tXg
I would second that being one of the most heartbreaking things I have seen as well.  I can't imagine how much pain he went through that day, but I am certainly glad that he did not let it keep him down and he went on to be the best president we have ever had.
He also spent a brief period of time in the service of the Confederate military.  He makes for a good example of why you should look at the totality of a man's actions when judging him, not look at a single footnote and decide you know the whole story.
I love Eluveitie for that very reason.  I think I would count *Helvetios* whole album across any genre of music.
Pretty much.  No one else I play with is on the spectrum (or at least not anywhere close to where I am).  When I DM, I don't have to deal with a lot of the table management issues you talked about because the table is filled by neurotypicals so more typical management techniques work.  I don't think my DMing style is adjusted at all to account for Asperger's or ADD.  The only times I find Asperger's or ADD to become relevant is when I am a player and I have to work with a DM that might not fully understand how my thought processes work.
I don't find the action in the prequels hard to follow at all.  In fact, that is one of the things I think has aged the best from them.  It is fast paced, exciting, and flows pretty damn smoothly.  Not many other movies have managed to do action at that level of scale and energy before or since.  If nothing else, they can stand as decent action movies even if they fail in other regards.\n\nThat is the biggest thing that I give them over TFA.  The action in TFA was bland, simplistic, and at some points down right dumb.  It didn't get anywhere close at matching the kind of energy found in the prequel trilogies.
I like to imagine that when they wrote up the official report, the infraction was listed as "Being a dumbass."
If all you have watched is the movies and you are unfamiliar with the comics at all, I will have to apologize.  I've been into superheroes for a long time and was already very familiar with the Marvel Universe when the MCU was first getting off the ground.  As such, my knowledge of the two blends together and it can be difficult for me to keep track of which ones are good for fans of just the MCU and which ones are better for more general Marvel fans.\n\nBy far my favorite MCU fanfic has been [The Joke](https://archiveofourown.org/works/435654).  It is short and pretty lighthearted, but it also could conceivably fit into canon with no adjustments.\n\n[SpiderMan hearts Jenny W](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6063511/1/SpiderMan-hearts-Jenny-W) is a pretty fun one for Marvel in general.  It ships a pair of characters that I didn't even realize that I wanted together until I read this fic.\n\n[Just a Face On a Train](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2093771/1/Just_a_Face_On_a_Train) is another one that isn't based off the MCU, this one instead being based off of *Spider-Man 2*.  It makes one of the more touching and feel good moments in the movie a bit more touching and feel good.\n\n[Harry Potter and the Invincible TechnoMage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage) goes a bit crazy with it's premise and lets Harry get pretty god-mode, but it is a fun ride.  The premise is the Harry is adopted by Tony Stark at a young age and by the time he goes to Hogwarts he has the full weight of the Avengers backing him.  There are several characters that aren't in the MCU, but enough context is given that you can probably understand what is going on.\n\nFinally, there is [A Man of Iron](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10156413/1/A-Man-of-Iron).  It takes the joke about Tony Stark being related to the Starks from Game of Thrones and takes it seriously.  It re-frames just enough things to have Iron Man make sense in the GoT universe, and just like in the MCU, him showing up is a bit of a game changer.
Probably a Harley.  I can see myself using it mostly as a more fuel efficient way of getting around, so I would want saddle bags big enough to hold some basic shit I would want to be carrying around with me and a seat comfortable enough to sit in for a while.
I am aware of the concept, but I definitely can't read off a list of them.  There are a lot of them and I don't think anyone can be expected to memories all of them.  Many of the ones I am familiar with are also National Parks and it can be tough to keep track of which ones are on which list.\n\nI would also like to point out that I personally have more on an interest in the natural sites rather than the cultural ones, so I am more familiar with those.  Cutting down the list to just the cultural ones cuts out the best stuff to me.  I always refer to the list as World Heritage Sites.\n\nI would also like to point out that I didn't learn about the list in school.  I learned about many of the locations on the list as important landmarks, but the list itself was left out of my school curriculum.
From what I know about Ramesses, he would have gotten a kick out of receiving full military honors from a foreign nation thousands of years after his death.
Lifeguarding.
Holy shit this is bad.  In coal country (where I live at the moment) run off from mines is the biggest problem facing the local environment.  It poisons the drinking water and kills of a wide spread of different animals.  It gets to the point that in some streams there is absolutely nothing living, even species of fish that have a reputation for being very hardy and able to survive almost any conditions.  Animals with weaker constitutions are hit so hard that some of them are driven to the brink of extinction (likely, we have missed some that have been driven extinct).  The mines themselves often take decades to be reclaimed by forests and some remain as moonscapes (no plant life at all) for many years.\n\nEven for people whose only interaction with nature is going fishing are heavily affected.  Many of the popular sport species are hit hard and become difficult to find outside of a small number of clean streams.  Any fish you do manage to find in polluted streams are so laden with heavy metals that it becomes a very bad idea to even think about eating them.\n\nAll of these effects don't just apply to those who live by the coal mines, but also to anyone downstream.  The mine runoff might get diluted, but it is still an issue all the way to the sea.  We should be doing everything in our power to reduce the runoff, no just throwing the stuff directly in the water going "LOL, who gives a fuck?"  I seriously hope that people downstream from mines start throwing class action lawsuits at them for polluting their drinking water.  \n\nI should point out that Washington D.C. is one such place.  Up stream (where it is the MD/WV border) the Potomac is horribly polluted and some people don't even recommend swimming in it.  It does get diluted by the time it gets to DC and forms the cities drinking water, but do they really want to bet that what the politicians have coming out of their tap at the office is clean enough once mines start throwing shit in the water?
He doesn't have the best singing voice, but I love their writing.  I am a big history buff and I love having a band singing about the things I care about.  Maybe eventually we will start seeing new bands do covers of their work that is even better while having the same subject appeal, but so far I have enjoyed most of their covers better than the bands who originally wrote them.
A lot of time, alternative energy is not really viable in the area that you see mining.  Wind energy is a bit, but certainly not to the extent that it can support the same amount of jobs.  Even if we support full training for these people to transition to alternative energy jobs, they would still need to relocate.  Some of them might be fine with relocating, but for most of them it would mean leaving behind a solid social network, their extended family, and land that has been in the family for generations.\n\nYou also run into the issue that there are a number of towns that almost completely rely of the coal industry for the local economy to stay afloat.  If you have every coal miner relocate to chase other jobs, then there isn't going to be enough money in the area to support things like auto-mechanics, general goods stores, and a large number of other sort of shops you see in small towns.  The economic implications of coal going under spiral pretty far outwards from just the people who actually work with coal.
At my school, the  vast majority of Asian students *were* from other countries.  There were a few that were American, but for the most part they were people who came here for school.  Our computer science program in particular was almost entirely people from India.
It is mostly having a hobby you can share with her.  You will find that most guys who are really into anything will have an increased attraction to a woman who has the same hobby.  Someone who is really into beer or football will have a similar elevated level of attraction to a woman who is also into those hobbies.
In case anyone is wondering, [yes there was an NFL player who did regularly celebrate by "dancing" like this.](https://youtu.be/mBIsBQ8I4jk?t=1m55s)
In my experience, experiments that support the null hypothesis are published all of the time.  They just don't make it into the news because they are frankly not interesting to anyone who doesn't work in the field.  As an example, one of my professors had his PhD dissertation support the null hypothesis.  He published something like 10 papers based on that research.\n\nFurthermore, there is a very large body of published research that does not follow an experimental model at all.  Instead, it is a simple observational study where something is observed and described in as much detail as possible.  Most of the research that I have experience with falls into this category, where animals are observed and detailed statistics about them recorded, but there is not hypothesis being tested.\n\nBoth of these types of papers are important and end up getting cited by other researchers a lot, but they rarely make it into science media.  Newspapers and magazines want the big ground breaking things and so that is what they publish.  If they form your only way of being informed about science, then it would make sense that it seems like only experiments that support a different hypothesis than the null hypothesis are published.  However, if you ever spend the time to slog through the actual journals, then you will find there are a lot more things published.  I should note that my area of familiarity is in natural resource management.  It is entirely possible that it works very differently in different fields.
It costs money that I don't have.
They can be fun as a hobby, but I wouldn't expect to make a living out of them.  A small number of artisans who are skilled enough might be able to make enough profit off of high end productions to have that as their only job, but most people will just be covering expenses with maybe a few extra dollars in the pocket.\n\nPersonally, I have been thinking of taking up blacksmithing, but I don't expect to ever be making much money from it.  If I can make enough to cover expenses and maybe pay for some of my other hobbies, then that is a total success in my mind.
I don't think I have ever seen curry at a Chinese place.  At a Thai place it is usual and at an Indian place it is expected (to the extent that if they don't have curry they aren't really considered an India place).  However, I have never seen curry at a plain Chinese restaurant.  There are a few places that are generic Asian, any many of those will have curry, but they are not usually call Chinese restaurants.
>When it comes to weaponry, it's not a contest. G1 has wayyyy more guns. Many G1 folks have more than guns. They have larger weapons, body armor, maybe even explosives and stuff. So if it's an armed conflict, G1 has it, no question.\n\n>When it comes to training, G1 has people who know how to handle the guns they have, including many veterans and police officers. And even the ones who aren't formally trained are a lot of people who have spent time using guns and knives and stuff. So if it's about training, it's probably gonna go to G1.\n\nFirst off, if there is armed conflict, most of it will probably be conducted by those already in the military, so you have to ask which way the current military will probably go.  With Trump doing things like freezing out the Joint Chiefs from the NSC and sending in troops without proper intelligence, he is steadily becoming less and less popular with the active duty military.  With the intelligence community, he is even less popular with his dismissing them as unimportant and ridiculing them.  I strongly believe that if a Civil War is to start, it will be most likely with a faction of the military deciding that the best way for them to defend the Constitution is by acting against Trump.  Most of the fighting will be between the already established military, not militias.  If you ask me, the real answer to who would win comes down to who gets more of the military on their side.\n\nFurthermore, I think you have underestimated how many guns the anti-Trump crowd owns.  It may be less than that of the pro-Trump crowd, but it is not non-existent.  As an anecdote, I know a large number of gun owners (most of whom have formal training) and the furthest to the right these gun owners get is moderate conservative.  None of them were ever passionate about Trump and if a Civil War were to break out, most if not all of them would go anti-Trump.  Sure, as a national trend the G1 states may have more guns, but that doesn't mean there will not be any weapons in the G2 militias.\n\n>Now, let's say there is no armed conflict. Let's say the two groups just split. Like, the red states secede or whatever. When it comes to survival after the split, G1 has coal, oil, tons and tons of farm land to grow food and raise animals. That is, G1 largely controls the parts of the country where things are produced. And G2 is just the opposite. G2 is consumers. G2 eats the food, burns the oil, etc. Without G1's farmland, G2 would starve.\n\nActually, [California alone](http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-calcook-california-its-whats-for-dinner-20140312-story.html) produces a significant percentage of the food in the country.  This is on top of the food that is produced in the other states that are anti-Trump.  Minnesota, Colorado, and Washington are all pretty high on the list in terms of total food produced.  Once you also account for the fact that the states that are anti-Trump tend to have the most robust economies and coastal access they could easily import food from other countries.  It would make the food a bit more expensive, but it they would be a long way from starving.\n\nWhile the G1 states might produce more oil fossil fuels, they are not as ahead as you might think.  [If you look at the top 10 oil producing states](http://247wallst.com/special-report/2015/07/13/the-10-most-oil-rich-states-2/2/), you will see Colorado, New Mexico, and California on the list.  If you look at [where refining it done](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/USEIA_-_Map_of_US_Oil_Refineries.png) you will see that while there is the most in G1 states, G2 states do have a few major ones.  The anti-Trump states might have a disadvantage on fossil fuels, but it is not as if one side will have them and the other will not.\n\nFurthermore, fossil fuels have been becoming increasing non-viable economically.  The more we take out of the earth, the more expensive it is to extract the rest.  As we move forward, renewable energy resources will become increasingly important for maintaining the energy needs of our population.  [If you look here](http://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-jobs-in-renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency?/fact-sheet-jobs-renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency-11-jun-2013) you will see that it is the G2 states have invested in it far more than the G1 states.  Both have investments in this technology, but it is the G2 states that have the advantage.  As such, there is no way that the G1 states will have some sort of uncontested dominance in energy resources.
Better.
The prequels drew many things from the books that had not been in the movies previously.  In that way, they tied neatly into the existing canon.  However, TFA chose to completely ignore the books which very much makes it a separate set of canon.
Having to be up and out the door by 6 every morning.
I grew up just outside DC.  There is a fuck ton of stuff in the area that most certainly was on the target list.  Hell, if they only sent one nuke over, it probably would be centered on DC.  \n\nHowever, my town itself had nothing of note in it.  We wouldn't have been a direct target, just collateral damage as they took out everything around us.
There have already been wars in other places over water.  If we manage to fuck up all of our water, you can bet there will be some sort of conflict.
If we account for different regions of the same states going different ways, then there are a lot of Red States that have solidly Blue sections.
With high enough quality ore and smelting techniques, folding like that can actually weaken the blade.
What about attraction precludes a friendship from forming?  If two people acknowledge each other as attractive but for other reasons decide to not act on it, does that still preclude a friendship from forming?  Furthermore, do you think that bisexual people are completely incapable of forming platonic relationships?\n\nFrom an anecdotal perspective, I have many women I am friends with that I acknowledge as attractive, but I have no intention of forming a relationship with.  Perhaps in your experience, you have never seen this happen, but that does not mean it does not exist.
I don't know all that much about the specifics.  From what I understand, at this point most of the jobs are skilled positions that required specialized knowledge of the equipment or of geology.  A good portion of the danger has been removed thanks to automation and better safety equipment.\n\nMost of the mines around me are surface mines, so they don't at all resemble what you see in *October Sky*.  Picture more a typical quarry, but instead of sandstone or marble being harvested, it is coal.
Unfortunately, free journals are not really a thing, at least in my field.  You can find a few articles for free, but most of the good stuff is going to be behind pay walls.  When I am doing research, my first scan is always just me reading abstracts and then the ones that look useful I try to see if I have access through an organization I belong to.\n\nIn particular, I have never heard anything favorable said about PLOS.  Maybe it is better represented in other fields, but in natural resources barely anyone ever bothers looking at it.  It could be that the issues that you have with science publication do apply completely to PLOS.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of observational studies being used, though you will be likely unable to access the full text for most of them:\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347281800930\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334727680053X\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347276800437\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016815919400550X\n\nhttps://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase1993/107/2/107_2_141/_article/-char/ja/\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/pdf/nature21370.pdf\n\nhttp://www.thaiscience.info/journals/Article/TNAH/10982013.pdf\n\nhttp://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-18121-001/\n\nI haven't seen a single popsci article about any of these articles.  Maybe they are out there somewhere, but they certainly haven't been spread around a whole bunch.  However, studies like this make up the bread and butter for several publications.  Especially *Animal Behavior* which sometimes seems to almost exclusively publish ethograms.
We do baby other industries.  Do you remember the massive bail-out of the auto industry?  We also throw billions of dollars at farmers every year so they can grow food even when it isn't economically viable.  Coal just so happens to be one such industry that is contentious and so some people would like to see it disappear completely, which puts us in this sort of standoff.
I was raised Jewish, so I read a lot of books about the Holocaust through religious school.  Night might be my absolute favorite.  Maybe it is because he was actually there and just describing his memories, but something about his writing style was so smooth and vivid that it was hard for any other books to measure up.
The new rules that were to be applied are pretty much exactly along the lines of the kind of rules that I advocate being added.
If it were up to me, I would tell the Trump base to go fuck themselves, but it isn't up to me.  I think incumbent Republicans are worried they won't be able to stand a chance with people coming at them from the left and the right, so they are trying to piss off a minimum number of people on the far right.
That's what you call when instead of leaving to find new jobs the people just sit there and wallow in self pity.  Also, I doubt that any new drugs will be able to push their way in.  Coal country is pretty firmly held by moonshine and meth.  Hillbillies like drugs they can make themselves or get from a friend instead of stuff they have to buy from some guy they barely know.
It is hefty enough that it needs to be accounted for in politics.  They can't win an election by themselves, but if you get them on your side they can be a big asset and if you piss them off they can be a thorn in your side.
Most of them take their skills that they learned in the military and go to private companies or other government agencies.  Their time in the military is seen as an important step in their career even if they don't spend their full time there.  They probably could have stayed in the military, but for most specialties, once you reach a certain point the career opportunities are better elsewhere.  The main exception is those with leadership potential who are given more opportunities to climb the ranks and therefore get better pay.
Yeah.  I'm not fond of hair at all.  I don't consider it a major factor and am willing to put up with body hair, but that doesn't change the fact that I would rather it not be a thing.\n\nI have looked at laser hair removal, but it is a bit out of my price range right now.  Maybe when I have more money, but there are a lot of things I would rather have then being slightly irritated with hair.  I also tend to avoid major cities so Groupon is usually not an option for me with anything.
They're loyal to Trump, at least for now.  If the GOP turns on him too soon, they risk making a martyr out of him and it will take them a while to win that crowd back.
They would want to recruit the person and failing that study them to duplicate the powers first.  Any government that could get those abilities under their control would be at a significant advantage over other ones.  As such, they would not try to kill the person while there was still a chance to have that power working for them.\n\nIf recruitment failed, they would likely attempt to live capture the person so they could study them in an attempt to duplicate the abilities for their own people.  It is only if both recruitment and live capture failed that they would resort to lethal force.
Or back different people in the primaries.  It happened when the Tea Party rose to power, in several solid Red districts incumbents were beat out in the primaries.

There are a small handful of episodes that tie together between the shows, but they are specifically written so that you can get what is going on from just watching one show.  For the most part, the shows run completely independent of each other and you can easily watch one and never touch the other.  I believe that Joss was aiming for something that could be watched in tandem or could be watched on it's own for both shows.\n\nYour plan of finishing out Buffy and then watching Angel will work just fine.  When you do go to watch Angel, there are a few episodes that you will want to keep in mind how they line up with what is happening in Buffy, but that is it.
Fuck Yeah!  Planet Hulk!\n\nI'm a bit disappointed that we won't get an entire movie devoted to that story line, but hopefully we get all of the key elements from it.  Most important is the character development for Hulk coming to terms with what he is and even reaching happiness with his transformed self.
It isn't just a matter of getting training for other jobs.  Coal is a big enough thing in some areas that if you get rid of it there simply aren't other jobs available.  The entire local economy will collapse.  If you want to find additional work, you will have to move somewhere else.  Abandon your social network, your extended family, often homes and land that has been in the family for generations.\n\nJust look at the ghost towns out west that got abandoned when the gold dried up.  The same thing could potentially happen to towns where everyone has been established for decades.  These people don't want to leave and seek out opportunities elsewhere, they want to live in the place they think of as home with the people they know.\n\nThen there is the fact that a large number of people have been in their jobs for a long time.  Once you are closer to retirement than the start of your career, most people don't really care for starting over.  At that point, most people don't have the energy or the financial flexibility to jump from job to job until they find something stable.  They already have something stable and would like to keep it until they are done working.  I know that I hate the uncertainty of looking for work and I am in my twenties and can afford to be without a job for a while.  Now imagine someone facing the same kind of uncertainty, but they also have kids, a mortgage, insurance payments, and various other bills that people accumulate over their lives.  Sure some of them might luck out and land immediately in a job that pays as well as they had before, but the vast majority would be left out in the cold.\n\nI also know that if someone came to me today and told me my degree was now worthless and I would have to go back to school, I would be pissed.  That was several years of my life that I dedicated to getting the education for the career I wanted, if I had to go straight back to school, then it would feel like I wasted those years of my life even if additional years were free.  For someone who has years of on the job training and decades of experience, telling them to go to school is a slap in the face and tells them that all of the hard work they put into having a stable career is now worthless.
If you ask me, the correct answer is to let the industry die slowly.  If you try to pull the plug on it all at once, then you will have too many people out of work and too many towns without an industry to support them.  However, if the number of jobs supported by coal slowly decreases, it is easier for local economies to adjust and for people to go into other jobs instead of coal.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to be told that coal is a dying industry.  In part it is because they have heard a number of people who don't know anything about coal talking about how bad it is and that it should be gotten rid of.  When a person who likes the job they have hears people saying that their job shouldn't exist anymore, they stop listening and instead start fighting to keep their job around.  It is a short sighted mindset, but you will find a number of people to be very short sighted.
I graduated high school in 2008.
Mostly I'm looking at moderate voters.  There is a pool of people that are perfectly willing to split their ticket and vote for people in both parties when there are reasonable candidate from both sides.  However, so long as the GOP acts like complete ass-hats, they drive a lot of these voters away.  \n\nKeep Trump too long, and they drive too many away and get beat up in the general.  Get rid of Trump too early, and they drive away the alt-right base and get beat up in the primary.  It is a lose-lose situation that they have found themselves in and now they are acting to mitigate the damage.
The problem is that Trump has a hefty and very loyal base.  If the Republicans turn on him too soon, they piss off that base and will have trouble with them for some time.  If they wait too long, they piss off the rest of America (those that aren't already pissed at them).  For this to work, they have to time turning on Trump just right or else no current Republican politician is going to be safe for some time.
There are more events I enjoy in the Summer Olympics, but a higher percentage of the events in the Winter Olympics are ones I enjoy.  I really have a tough time picking between the two.\n\nI think if I was forced to pick, I would go with the Summer Olympics.  All of the sports that I have personal experience playing are summer sports and there is a wider variety of events that I get to watch.
It is still a major industry in a few areas.  The area supported by coal is shrinking, but in that area it is still the major industry.  I know a few people that voted for Trump specifically because they were worried about Clinton killing the coal industry which would put them out of a job.  In places where the biggest chunk of the jobs come from mining and transporting coal, there is a serious concern that killing coal will make the local economy go to shit.  Now, any politician with two brain cells will know that coal should die a slow death to avoid those problems, but these people don't trust anyone who campaigns on the idea of killing coal to have their interests in mind to make it die a slow death.

I'm actually in a Blue state, it is just the tiny sliver of MD that pokes in between WV and PA, so the region as a whole is very Red.  This state just happens to get carried by the Baltimore area every election.  I'm a transplant though, and chances are I will be somewhere else by next election.  I'm not even registered to vote here because I grew up in VA which is a bit more swing state and I am probably not going to have a long term job for a while so I haven't bothered to change my permanent address.
Yup.  He even stated that he was confused at the time as to the political motivations of the rebellion.  I was trying to point out that if all someone saw about him was that he had served with the Confederacy, they might assume him to be anti-abolitionist and a racist.  It forms a good object lesson as to why it is important to learn all of the facts and context before judging a person.
I didn't even bother watching the movie.  There are some stories that work in one medium and just don't in another.  I could tell when I first read it that *The Giver* couldn't work right in any medium but prose and a movie would just be a waste.  It is all about experiences shaping what you see in the world even if nothing actually changes and that is something that just can't properly be done in a visual format.

Season 4 of Buffy happens at the same time as Season 1 of Angel.  They continued being lined up from there (5 with 2, 6 with 3, and 7 with 4).  Only Season 5 of Angel takes place after Buffy is over.
Who do you think was better?  I would give Teddy the top spot for his conservation work alone, but I also massively respect what he did with trust busting, diplomacy, food quality, and the building of the Panama Canal.
I count soup as a meal if it is hearty enough and served in enough volume.  Soup can in theory contain just about anything and so you can cover all nutritional bases with it.  \n\nThe issue that comes up is that it often gets a bit boring to eat just soup.  Even the best soups end up a bit homogeneous as far as taste is concerned and so even after eating a bowl that could be a full meal I find myself craving something else.  From a culinary arts standpoint, this is the main reason you see soups served as sides much more commonly than main courses.  They are for the most part simply not interesting enough to carry a meal by themselves.\n\nThere is also the fact that many soups are designed to be a bit on the light side in terms of caloric content.  This makes sense for many people as it is pretty common for most people to consume too many Calories and so look for ways to cut down their intake, but if you live an active lifestyle it is sometimes necessary to eat a lot more Calories than most people.  If each bowl of soup only has a couple hundred Calories, then I am going to have to eat so many bowls to make it a full meal it becomes inconvenient.
On a whim I was looking at the births and deaths of various famous people to see if any would fit as a bridge between Andrew Jackson and Adolf Hitler so they could be reincarnations of each other.  The best fit was Mary Ann Nichols.
The idea isn't generally to keep it around forever, but simply to not let anyone hasten it's demise.  I don't think there is anything that anyone can do to stop the decline of coal production even if we directly subsidize it like we do with farms.\n\nThat said, coal still makes up a third of the country's energy production and has a ton of industrial uses (the biggest being a key ingredient in the production of steel).  There is still a big market for coal and if someone is sitting on a pile of some they can make big bucks selling it to the right person.
I'm in the same boat.  I'm hoping they give her better material to work with next season.  She is clearly a talented actress and they have the foundation for making Dolores an very nuanced and interesting character.

The revisionist history going on with Wilcox's two years at USC is weird.\n\nHis defenses are now sandwiched between two Clancy Pendergast defenses that were vastly better with similar levels of talent. USC's roster was certainly worse off in 2013, when the defense was better, than when Wilcox coached in 2014 and 2015. Sanctions should not be used for excusing Wilcox's USC defenses: they lacked aggression, rarely used athletic advantage to rush the passer, played tentatively, and as a result were hugely mistake-prone.\n\nUSC's national rankings in opponent 10+ yard plays from scrimmage:\n\n2013: 55th\n\n2014: **95th**\n\n2015: **106th**\n\n2016: 20th\n\nWilcox has been good at other places, but he blew it at USC.

All these countries have several ethnic groups, so it's kind of complicated. It's very easy to tell that a Laotian or Cambodian is not Japanese. But it's super hard (for me) to say whether someone is Laotian or Cambodian just based on looks. The majority of Vietnamese people are part of an ethnic group that is sort of a combination of Southeast Asian and East Asian genetics, so they look much more Chinese.\n\nSource: spent time in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China

Until this summer, he'd always been seen as a paragon of virtue, admired by the left for the way he stood up to Alberto Gonzalez and the Bush Administration as Deputy Attorney General. He is known for requiring every new FBI employee to read J. Edgar Hoover's order to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. as a reminder of the abuses that the bureau is susceptible to.\n\nI wonder how it must feel to know that every good deed, every act of generosity or kindness or honor that he has ever committed in his life will be outweighed by the enormity of this incredible fuck-up.
While technically correct, without context that is kind of like cheering all the things the South African government did for whites under apartheid.

If you replace 'Planned Parenthood' with 'hospitals,' your proposition sounds ridiculous, because it is ridiculous.\n\nIt's like asking, why doesn't the government just not fund healthcare? Won't the free market just take care of it?
A marijuana attorney I heard speak said the same thing. Federal regulation will loosen under a Republican administration when pigs fly, but to avoid burning political capital they might just leave the states alone. So the best case scenario is 'benign neglect.'
The Oregon Zoo was actually the first place in the western hemisphere where Indian elephants were successfully bred, and the elephant in the video was born in the zoo.

It's small compared to most public universities in the US and it's certainly quite small if you're approaching it from the perspective of "I just don't understand why they can't guarantee admission if you have perfect grades."

Of course she won't live up to expectations; she ran on rent control, which is illegal and impossible. We have a bad, weird, stupid system of city government that Eudaly is especially unqualified for.
That's crazy talk. He's a two-term president during a period of tremendous global transition. You can bemoan his accomplishments or lack thereof, but he was not exactly a 19th century caretaker president.

IMO the essence of the point is true and doesn't need to be corrected.

Many of Spielberg's movies are sappy as hell. Even some of the ones that aren't--Saving Private Ryan, for instance, would be better described as 'brutal' than 'sentimental'--have these formulaic emotional moments thrown in, usually at the end.

Sometimes it works, and sometimes it falls flat or feels emotionally manipulative. \n\nI think some of his best movies of the last few decades are the ones that have avoided this--Munich and Lincoln come to mind.

You'll notice the word "monk" used repeatedly in the quote you cite.\n\nTheravada would disagree with you, on the basis of the word 'monk', but Mahayana would not.\n\nVajrayanas such as myself would say "it depends on the prescription your lama gave you."\n\nWe are quickly reaching the "no true Buddhist" one-liner, arent we now?
That's why you don't bother protesting fascism, you simply jump straight to voilently revolting against it.
I still wouldn't trust American immigrants, nonetheless.\n\nTheir whole society is very violent and they make people follow religious laws by intimidating nonbelievers into compliance.
Character assassination is how things are done, especially since the digital revolution gives us nonstop feeds of whatever subject an ad dad in would bring to light. \n\nIt is *funny* that Assange looks worse as time goes on, as it happens to any enemy of the State.

Christian doctrine doesnt allow for torture or religious warfare, either, but that didnt stop 400 years of killing apostates, jews, and pagans.\n\nLets face it: ALL religions eventually come around to violent extremism--not just your least favorite ones, or just the ones that are in a violent mode right now. 
And, given his other job, is in his personal interest to do so.
The especially delusional part is that they ignore the deregulation and the real estate capitalists that caused the great recession, and then elect a real estate tycoon to deregulated the financial industry even more!\n\nForget about learning from history, because most of these people seem unable to learn from experience.
This is about politicized religion, not modernity per se.\n\nThe value of rationalism was not lost on Islamic scholars for nearly 300 years before the fall of Baghdad and the rise of the Islamic dark age we are currently living in.\n\nThis has more to do with using religion to control people's lives than about the particular religion being used to that purpose.\n\nAlso, it would be wise for you to be aware of gang-recruiting tactics for the sake of the well-being of people close to you. They pick on emotionally vulnerable people who they know are going to join any cause that hits the right buttons--and these people live everywhere.

This is cute because it only highlights the fact that you've never gone to any meetings of any socialist clades.
> They're relatively well-known\n\nAlso not a source.\n\nThe bigfoot video is relatively well-known too. Does that mean its a video of bigfoot, or a video being presented as a film of bigfoot?\n\nYou have to think critically about unfounded claims, or you are mentally a slave to the people who know how to pull your strings.

You haven't actually pointed out (cited a source) in what ways the Patriot Act changed, because if you did you'd find that it's language has gotten *stronger*.\n\nIt's one thing to pretend that just the word *change* is good, and another thing to research that *change* and learn just how the law has been altered.

Authoritarianism **is** on the rise in the US, I see.
People who compare democratic countries to private houses make it obvious they don't believe in collective responsibility.\n\nNo wonder the US relies so much on Charity instead of letting the State run a functional social safety net.
A lot of American Socialists share this sentiment.
The reason the Democrats lost is because they decided not to be as far left as the Socialists.\n\nThey lost a lot of votes by giving the prolotariat the middle finger.
It is a construction of right wing authoritarianism, but it doesn't mean that only the US right wing supports it: the Democrats and Republicans agree on many right wing social *and* economic policies.

It is not a muslim ban this is an awb ban
>And how do you propose to get a majority of the population to support nasty assholes\n\nApparently claim Trump is against it is how! /s\n\nSeriously though the fact you are now divided over free speech because of Milo is sad. That is what those who want to take rights always do, they put up something nasty as an excuse. \n\nCriticize comments that Milo, in this case, has said, but defend his right to say it.\n\n‘What a fuss about an omelette!’ he had exclaimed when he heard of the burning. How abominably unjust to persecute a man for such an airy trifle as that!
As the other stories I will take this as a data point and nothing more. We have gotten so caught up in these "breaking news" stories that it is getting just tiring.\n\n If this is true then I hope it is dealt with. What Trump ran on, and is working towards, is too important to be sidetracked by the constant horse race games.\n\nThere has been so much going on in the State Department lately, but we are focused on 20 irrelevant articles about Milo. \n\n
I believe you are thinking of black powder not being considered a firearm or destructive device.\n\nThis is true and you can easily own any kind of black powder cannons, even big coastal guns, as long as it doesn't have a selft contained shell. (rough Description)\n\nExplosive shells are regulated, but I believe they can be owned with proper paperwork\n\n\n[Site where you can buy blackpowder cannons](http://steencannons.com/)\n\nNow don't get me wrong its an expensive process to have modern artillery, tanks, and the like, but it can be done.
His point isn't ridiculous. There is not an executive of the "free speech movement", unlike our government where there is an executive, our president. 
> What am I "helping"?\n\nYou are not helping, that's my point. All of your posts to seem like an endless attack, no matter what the action is. I suspect if he would have terminated DACA you would have blamed the political chaos on Trump.\n\n>Frankly, I think it's bad policy to leave executive amnesty in place.\n\nSo if this is what you meant by, "What am I "helping". Maybe you should help facilitate a way for this to happen. \n\nYou tell me.\n\nUh you are the one who said it. Do you not believe in political capital?
>when he gets questions or challenged by someone who actually knows what he's talking about.\n\nWho would that be? I am sure it is not the MSM you are talking about who claim there is not something horrible going on in Sweden at the moment.

If Trump was removed from this headline it would have fit your parameters. Reddit has been shitting on this  train for a long time.
>Trust the government.\n\nYou are using this to attack Trump and he hasnt done anything.
Nope you can own functioning tanks, bombs, and artillery pieces, it is just a long progress then a firearm.
There was a report on Sweden the night before.
Just out of curiosity isn't the age of consent in the UK 16? \n\nI am firm on the social construct set up in most of the country with age of consent being 18, note that some states are less than 18, but isnt it disingenuous talking through everything he has said/trying to say with an American point of view?  
Just as the Left does the same thing to the right
Yea we should really defend an outlet that pushed a claim that President watched two hookers pee on each other in a Russian hotel with no evidence.\n\nYea real top notch 
> Philando Castile \n\nThey didnt jump to an immediate statement about an incident until facts surfaced, unlike the left.
Half based Indian man
Yes, too bad he has to  waste time fighting Republicans from undermining every move that he hasn't had time to address this. Maybe you should rally those in your circle to help us so he can have room to take action.
There is not a new law and they still cant just dump in the water.
>When the POTUS speaks, every word matters.\n\nApparently not to you though. The only words you are focusing on are last night and not the rest of what was said. 
I dont see where any of his comments about this video are "pushing for that line of reasoning" but thats just me\n\n
I dont think we will agree on much due to your views on nationalism or the view that Milo is a member of the alt-right, but these are secondary to this story.\n\n>Promoting Milo hurts everyone's chance of having free speech\n\nNo it wont, relax. This is a conversation that has been happening for hundreds of years and honestly has not changed. Defend what you want from Milo and criticize what you dont like, but defend his right to say it. You are making this bigger then it is. \n\nI personally think Milo's comments were too nuanced and used improper word choice that night. With the context of written and oral statement I understand what he was trying to say and do not see the outrage.
yes you did\n\nYou implied that the two were similar\n\nChristianity, by doctrine, doesn't support these things.\n\nIslam, by doctrine, does support these things.\n\nSo trying to compare institutional qualms with qualms with the teachings of a religion is ridiculous 
I didnt get an example for what he has done yet and there are plenty of replies on why hit pieces that always come from certain few people are wrong.
> Opposing Trump when he does things that aren't conservative or aren't constitutional \n\nExample?
Like I have said before rally your group so that we have room to move.  I would like to see it repealed ASAP, but I do not see it as a priority if the wall is built and deportations of criminals is stepped up. \n\nWhy not channel your want for DACA repeal through the courts where it would most likely be found to be unconstitutional. \n\n\n\n
Its been stopped before, but it depends on what they put in the bill. If the bill is straightforward, it most likely wont be, I will be all for it.
You can buy armored  personnel  carriers
>M1 tanks at the ford dealership\n\nNo you are right, you buy tanks from other entities. Tanks and rockets are legal in the United States
>  Most poverty stricken areas just have gas stations or dollar stores as their neighborhood store.\n\nThis is bs that was created by the expansion of social welfare. These places used to have the basics. Flour, eggs, government cheese, etc, etc. This declined when EBT and food stamps could be used for anything. 
This kind of gets at my major issues that I have been trying to convey.\n\nThe last 8+ years have felt like a siege. The last year I choose and defended, not a perfect defender, but someone who took the charge out the gates to break the siege. The problem is I have had to defend from more attacks from our own refuge than those attacking us.\n\nLike it or not Trump is the one who broke the siege and he has set up a camp for others to come and use to strike back, but where are they? They are still back in the wrecked castle scared to move. Trump obviously still has a lot of actions to take, but the decision to act on major campaigns is not today.\n\nThis is all made even more hilarious because his major detractors, on both sides, said he was going to be a dictator and take tons actions that surpass his authority, but he has done nothing of the  sorts.\n\nHold him to account I don' care, but if you do, you better be holding your representatives and senators to higher account. While you are at it hold these faux Republicans to the fire because they are doing far worse than Trump.
Okay what in the emails do you all not like?\n\nPruitt was picked to reign it in. This has been known.
>monster who advocates sexually violating children\n\nListening to the full non edited version and his reply you still feel the same way?
its 16 in some states in the Us I think
All of our other differences asside I agree. The only problem im hearing from this is the tendency  for these types of measures to increase to the point where its effectively just another tax.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the actual plan.
> His anti-business protectionist bullshit;\n\nI dont totally disagree, but looking at inequalities by trade deals and pushing for American priorities is not "bullshit".\n\n>his attacks on the free press; \n\nWhat has he done to hinder the sanctity of the free press? O, thats right he bad mouthed institutions that trotted out that he watched two Russian hookers pee on each other in a Russian hotel. The same media who constantly  call him an anti-semite, when his daughter and son in law are orthodox jews, and his close ties to Israel.\n\nEdit: the same press we know literally colluded with the Hillary campaign \n\n>his attacks on the judicial system and perhaps most importantly\n\nHas he forced out judges? No he made statements like a vulgarian about activist judges, good.\n\n>using his twitter account to insult individuals and foreign nations.\n\nWell got to get your point across when the media calls you a racist,bigot, antisemite, etc etc. That being said I think he should cool it a little, but it in no way makes me literally  shake.\n\n> He is garnering anti-US sentiment like we've never seen.\n\nNo he is not, maybe you should take that cursory  look into history a little further. If you did you would find Obama in Egypt encouraging the Arab Spring and the Muslim Brotherhood  in Egypt. You would  see a vacuum  in Iraq and the arming of al qaeda. If you look close enough you might even see the complete destruction  of Libya.\n\nUnder Trump we are seeing a support of moderates Egypt, who has been doing right by Israel at loss of some local support and an end to the pissing contest with Russia in Syria, because if we were really interested in civilian casualties  and peace thats what we would do in a heart beat.\n\nIn SE Asia we see a more open support of the freedom of Taiwan and Japan seems estatic about Abe's visit with Trump.\n\nSeems like we have the potential to right many wrongs  and head in a great direction at last.
I think the problem many have is because at some level they believe that these people's stated goals are what they actually  want.\n\nI believe they  want something completely different.
>There's another thing people **fail to consider** about withdrawing from the TPP\n\nJust because people dont come to the same conclusion as you doesn't mean they havent considered it. I fully disagree with it being a net positive for our citizens. \n\n>Calling them the enemy of the people, for one. It's gotten to the point that you have senior reporters from Fox News criticizing Trump for his comments. **Do you really think it's defensible?**\n\nYes when they maliciously lie and mislead the people they are the enemy of an educated nation, but to the point of do I find it defensible; yes. We are talking about a major news agency, with zero evidence, ran a story that the our elected president watched two Russian hookers pee on each other.  Not to forget all of the claims of anti-antisemitism when that is furthest from the truth.\n\n\nThis faux outrage is even more hilarious when Obama used the government to go after journalist, but o no Trump said mean things.\n\n\n>You don't see an issue with the President attacking the judiciary for ruling against him?\n\nNo, because almost every single president, and certainly the last few decades, the President has gone against the Judiciary when they feel like they were wronged.\n\n\n>What about the necessary checks and balances?\n\nWhat checks and balances has Trump burned from the constitution?\n\n>You actually don't.\n\nYes you do, there is a long game being played and this is not the last time we will hear talks about a free Taiwan.\n\n>What does Trump plan to do to curb climate change?\n\nWhat has any president really done? Obama didn't do squat for "climate change". I am all for targeted actions to curb air quality but dont see the futile squawking about climate change as beneficial.\n\n >How does he intend to improve public education in US?\n\nSchool choice would be a great step.\n\n\n>What are his intentions for healthcare beyond gutting the ACA?\n\nHopefully it ends with the ACA being blown up. It has shown to be an unstable and unsustainable  mess. It doesn't help the American people.\n\n\n\n
So unnecessary. \n\nYou are using the argument that the right only paints the left as poorly as they can when elements of the left paint anyone who disagrees with them as racist, bigots, xenophobic, antisemitic, etc.\n\n\nTry harder.
estatic. Megyn was horrible, it was always fun though to play "What crazy thing is she going to do with her hair or clothes tonight" with the SO.
I would say Glenn is actually  crazy instead of fun crazy 
>it's always been bad\n\nNot going to even touch that.\n\nNow\n\n>I never claimed he was any of those things.\n\nbefore\n\nArticle and reply to a comment talking solely about Milo Yiannopoulos\n\n>Milo is a part of the alt-right\n\nYou stated the alt-right is\n\n>Anti-semitism, racism, nationalism, fascism, etc.\n\nthen \n\n>I never claimed he was any of those things.\n\nSo which is it, because it seems to me that you are trying to make that case with your comments.\n\n
There arent any guidelines.  I thought this was the meta to get ideas out.\n\nMilo is irrelevant  and there were stories plastered everywhere about him. Just seemed silly when thete was so much more important things going on.\n\nWe have gotten into this slump of only talking about reactionary he said she said games. \n
Not only striking Syrian forces but Russian forces. He still aided in the destruction of Libya so he doesn't get free pass.
That was taken over long ago.
> Whether it has a net benefit depends on how you view it. That's not the point though - I'm merely bringing up the fact that the TPP did have benefits for the US. I'll let this comment explain it better:\n\nOkay so this subject is pointless we disagree and it has veered away on why we must be literally shaking because of Trump\n\n\n>CNN? Did you **actually read** the article? It **never mentioned those specifics**, just fyi, \n\nYes, and sure it did. It directly linked to it and peddled that travesty of journalism. The NYT has peddled complete falsehoods for over a year. Maybe they should stop getting hurt, move away from opinion pieces and get back to facts based journalism\n\n>Please link me an instance of Obama attacking the judiciary. Otherwise, this false equivalence really has to stop.\n\nWhy dont you go back and watch the 2010 State of the Union where he attacked the Supreme Court on the citizens united decision, so not I really wont stop.\n\nHow? Every country that has been ranked top for education has one thing in common - a robust and well maintained public education system. \n\nThose countries have a lot more things in common that surpasses a well robust public education system. We dump billions in the education system I am all for a change up.\n\nAll in all though this discussion is getting away from what this thread started on. This discussion has quickly devolved into a discussion between a conservative and someone who is not. 
> The stance of myself and many others is\n\nSure I disagree with your stance, but your stance doesn't set the parameters of the argument. For the longest time the wall itself was hoisted as a xenophobic and racist symbol

Except its not.

Yes you can buy fighter  jets i dont think the FAA allows weapons on them.
Comparing Milo to the notoriety of Lebron and Osama, I am sure Milo would love that. \n\nThere is no face to the concept of free speech. It is one of the most fluid concepts in our republic with the only "leader" is the last person to say something offensive. Like I said elsewhere the only people elevating him to this status are the ones that dont seem to like him\n\nbtw Nationalism is fantastic
Yes he is telling like it is and still people are taking parts of it the wrong way
Thats not how any of this works.
>Do you believe we need more, or less environmental regulation in general?\n\nWrong question, what regulations do you want?
>Anti-semitism, racism, **nationalism**, fascism, etc.\n\nHeard it here in r/conservative folks. Nationalism is bad and horrible thing now, on the same level as antisemitism, racism, and fascism.\n\nThat being said debating about media personalities is pointless but I will play along. \n\nMilo for one is not part of this evil nationalistic alt-right you speak of and truth be told almost nobody is. During the campaign anyone who didn't fit in to the traditional Republican subsections were labeled as alt-right. No one heard of the alt-right before, so people went along with being labeled as alt-right. Then the media and the left drug out Spencer, someone with no visibility, and trotted him around like a ostrich at a dog show. Then linked the two separate groups together by the same name.\n\nBesides the self admitted bloviating attention getters that Milo uses, what has he specifically advocated for that is antisemitic, racist or fascist? 
I know you didnt, you implied it. 
Sure, but it is not, is it?\n\nTo the left a wall is racist 
Continue. I think there is a time and place for everything and there are more pressing issues that need to be addressed and the current climate would be hindered by DACA. I think he would be able to do it sooner if he didn't have to fight those on the right on popular actions. 
Does he feel conformable? What the hell are you getting at?
> bashing overweight people who are working out \n\nI havent seen that, but in sure there was a comment like that. Ive heard more bashing from him about the fat acceptance movement that encourages people  to.be over weight. 
People who say nasty things are the perfect poster people for free-speech rights. They are the most vulnerable to have it curtailed. 
O bs thats not where this is heading, your double speak on these threads is non stop. There is nothing wrong calling them put on their bs stories.
I love it. The new directives and Kelly's comments in Guatemala are amazing. 
I am sorry but that is BS. That is not to say that there is not a large number of people who cant, but a lot of people I see in debt are in it because they make horrible choices.\n\nThey go out partying non stop, rent out a place that is way outside their means, paying a mortgage they cant afford, a brand new vehicle, new vehicles  every two years, loading up credit cards, etc etc.\n\n
There is evidence presented in every one of these threads estimates  by gun control groups has DGUs in the tens of thousands and higher estimates has ot in the millions in a year

There have been known incidences of elections being stolen, largest being Nixon, but yea Voter id is totally racist
>Openly supporting Taiwan didn't do anything\n\nNot what I have heard from the preaching left.  It was the worst thing that could have ever happened. Its not a back down but a normalization until we are ready to move on the issue. It is a strategy to show that this is no longer an off the table issue.\n\n\n>We're also forgetting that Trump is essentially gutting the State Department \n\nNo we are not forgetting anything, this is a known and excellent move. They have failed to meet their goals over the last few decades and have ceded American power. Their time is over and a new path is in order.\n\n>You also have a very different perspective on the Middle East that doesn't really match up with reality.\n\nI certainly do not, anymore or less then you do. The POTUS certainly has a high degree of responsibility of these uprisings when he  supports them monetarily, politically, and militarily. \n\n>I'd like to know what your response would be if you were POTUS?\n\nIt would start with not supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, Islamic fundamentalist.\n\n>But the international system is much more shaky and unstable now under Trump than it was under Obama\n\nNo it is not, during the Obama administration we saw the beginning break up of the EU, dismantling of most of the functioning government in ME and North Africa, and an expanse of China around the world.\n\n\n
Reading his posts and listening to him, knowing that he was subject to sexual abuse, I dont think that was what he is trying to say at all.

Glad that's out there but that's not what it seems like from the day to day. I guess just have to chalk it up to a disagreement. 
You defined a group whose core ethos revolves around those specific things and then put someone in that group.\n\nNow you are telling me that person doesnt follow any of those specific mantras you described? \n\n

It just seems like you would rather shitpost.  \n\n\n>Trump's DHS order had instructions to leave Dreamers alone. \n\nYes they will have separate rules that I have not seen yet. I disagree with this and want a full repeal.

"Misled" maybe accurate but the way articles noe tend to place loose with their word choice I am not sure.\n\nOn one hand; I can see it as Trump new he mentioned  yhey would talk about sanctions later and there was a break down in communication Trump was not satisfied with. \n\nOn the other hand; maybe he did defended that he mentioned even less, either way  it is taken care of.

>If you had read the article\n\nI did, and I disagree with their primary statement, as well as your subsequent statements. He has a few good talking points that would fit in with any conservative discussion, some of which are the reason we won the election.\n\nIt seems like it is only those against him that are raising him as some sort of leader or deity. He is just another person talking. Some of what he says is good and some bad. Take what you want and leave the rest. \n\n\n\n\n
There is not a complaint on number, but the types of orders that were given.

You are an ass. There is nothing wrong with talking to his counterpart. The left pulling out the Logan act is sad and assanine?
> resistance to Trump should be bipartisan\n\nNo, what has he done that should be opposed?\n\n>I'm scared shitless by the man. / brings out the worst in people\n\nI am sorry I cant help you with that. He has not done anything to be "scared shitless" about. He is talking deescalation around the world and from the initial tidbits comming out of the State Department and CIA we are seeing real coalition building against radicals in the ME. This makes me happily stay on the train.
Yes i can. As soon as they started  calling everyone that has a different opinion a racist, bigot, etc etc.\n\nBeyond that look how Eric Holder left in disgrace and Loretta Lynch  meeting with Bill on the runway and they have the audacity to stall on Sessions of all people... they have lost the script and have no excuse.
The answer to your question is if you able to replace your current income with a 4% draw down on investments. The rental income and expenses will stay the same regardless of whether or not you have a day job. To replace a salary of $134k you need $3,350,000 in liquid investments - not your rentals. Your liquid investments total $655,000. \n\nHowever if you managed to cut expenses and streamline your lifestyle, you could generate a comfortable income of $77,800 a year (4% of $655k is $26,200 and your rental cashflow of $4300 a month)

congrats OP! but i see two problems with your theory - 1. the article implies that Bran will be able to communicate with the past, however GRRM and the books state that the whispers in the wind are as far as you can get. The 3 eyed raven (bloodraven) even says he's tried and it's futile. i his own words - "I have my own ghosts. A brother I loved, a brother I hated, a woman I desired. In my dreams I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them."\n\n2. it's pretty clear in the books that the three eyed raven is actually Bloodraven a.k.a. Brynden Rivers, a Targaryen bastard who is also a greenseer. 
orvis' guarantee/return policy is incredible. you could literally drive over it with your car and they will fix it for free.
what do you think it would rent for per month? you'll def make money since you're buying it with cash. it's just a matter of doing the math to figure out if the rate of return is worth it. for instance, let's say you can get $1,000 a month for the place. you should prob set aside about 10% for maintenance and if you use a property management company the lowest i've seen is 8%, but in reality, 10% is more likely. so that brings the income down to 800. taxes and insurance bring it down by $225 a month meaning you're now pocketing $575 a month, or $6900 a year which is a return of 8.625% on your money. this doesn't account for the the value of the home going up over time
this week at work we had a closet with four 3750 v2 switches that were plugged into a power strip and the strip was for some reason plugged into a GFCI outlet instead of the UPS. It had been like that for a while, but some electricians were pulling some new cables to the closet and turned on the light. the light was on the same circuit as the GFCI outlet and popped the breaker and took down the switches and 2 floors.

But things didn't go as planned. that deer put him in the hospital

You're both kinda wrong, and kinda right.\n\nShe's right that it can be a big money maker. she's probably wrong in thinking it's easy. Take it from me, someone who owns rental property, that there's a bit of a learning curve.\n\nYou're right thinking that it's too risky. you're wrong in thinking it's a complete lost cause. a good compromise might be to have her start small. Buy a smaller dollar figure property and put 50% down. give yourself a big cushion for when things don't go as planned - because they certainly will. \n\nanother option is to find a property that you would be interested in. instead of triplexes in the bay area, maybe vacation rentals on the coast or some Caribbean country, or some other option where there is something that you may find value in. 
for someone who lived in constant fear of death under joffrey, fear of being thrown out the moon door at the vail, then raped and tortured under ramsay, it makes sense why she doesn't get upset over other things that pale in comparison to the horrors she's gone through
i don't think there will be a need for the wall at the end of the series. from what we can now put together, the first men and the CotF were at war. CotF creates original white walker/nights king to fight first men, but then he turns on them. this is when the CotF and the first men sign a pact at the isle of faces to unite to beat the white walkers and somehow build the wall to keep them up north. so theoretically if the white walkers are destroyed at the end of the series by dragon fire or some other means, there will then be no need for a wall or a night's watch
I read a great analysis which I cannot find right now which said the peach represents enjoying life and abandoning ambition. Renly offered a peach to stannis as a way to plead with him to give up his ambition and enjoy his life, but stannis didn't realize this and took it as an insult. There are quotes from stannis long after renly's death to the effect of being plagued by renly's peach

i guess i was making a broader point not just about religion, but as how we view those we disagree with. Tywin seems like a monster, but when we understand when he came from, watching his father humiliated, losing his wife tragically, it brings a human element to why he'll do anything to restore his house to good name. Jamie is an accursed oathbreaker and kingslayer and seems like a horrible person until we hear his side of it. The literary cliche is when the bad guy is pure evil. When in reality even bad people usually have some sort of good intention.

i fully believe that mereen is an allegory for the US invasion of iraq. although the city was mentioned as early as the ACOK, the bulk of the mereen plot happens in AFFC which came out in in 2005. The iraq war began in march of 2003 which fits the timeline for GRRM's writing. and he has always been on the anti-war side of things. I believe it's a story about how even with the best intentions there are major problems when trying to forcibly bring modern views of human rights into a culture that either isn't ready or doesn't want it. in the same way the US tried to bring democracy to iraq, we see dany trying to abolish slavery in mereen. what will happen when she (the us) inevitably leaves?
an enterprise level network would have it's own standalone router (probably two for redundancy) with a 40 gig or 100 gig pipeline from the ISP and it would be something like this - http://www.bradreese.com/images/cisco-nexus-7000.jpg . the higher level stuff doesn't combine the router and modem(CSU unit). in some cases there would be two pipelines from two different ISPs for redundancy. traffic within the network (users to apps hosted in data center servers, intranet email, etc.) would never leave that router so the ISP would never see it.

i don't think the Targ valued the Seven very much. I believe they just tolerated each other. The faith looked the other way concerning Targ incest, and didn't make any power plays (with the exception of the first faith militant). In the same way the Targ dynasty let the greater houses stay in power once they bent the knee, it seems like they tolerated the faith so long as they were submissive
does this make you think twice about people in the real world who think like the high sparrow - i.e. the church?\n\ni think that's part of the genius of GRRM's writing. no one is ever 100% evil. there's usually another side of them that almost makes you understand the things they do that you don't agree with. maybe you still disagree with it, but at least you see them as a human trying to do the right thing in their minds instead of the cliche person-who-must-be-evil-because-they-don't-agree-with-me

you need more cash flow in your rental strategy. $140 a month could get eaten up real quick if something big breaks or if you go a month or two without renters. you generally want to have a reserve of 6 months of PITI so that's $7800 set aside for emergency repairs, evictions, months unrented, etc.\n\nalso, something doesn't add up in your numbers for rent versus home value. Rents are generally tied to home values as a rule of thumb. So if you take the value of your home and run the numbers for a 30 year mortgage plus taxes and insurance, the rent will usually be marked up about 10-15% from that amount. if your home is worth $210,000 a 30 year fixed at today's competitive rates of 3.5% would be $943. insurance would be around $100 a month and taxes, depending on your local tax law would prob be another $150 a month for a total of $1193. if you mark it up by 15% then the rent you could get would be $1372 which is a long way from $2000. I would guess either the house is worth more than you realize, your info on local rent is wrong, or a combination of the two. the easiest way to find out is to contact a property management company and tell them you're interested in having them manage your rental. they'll come check it out. they will be able to give you a pretty accurate estimate about the amount of rent it will bring. It's their job - it's what they do all day every day
An offensive invasion is a risk that if not carefully calculated, could result in you losing your head. Even thoug from our perspective Aegon's invasion may seem like a good play because of the crumbling of the tyrell/lannister alliance as well as dorne's eagerness to combine forces, it's still two armies fighting each other. And on a level playing field there's a lot that is left to chance and could go wrong. Danaerys has dragons. It's the equivalent of bringing laser guided missiles and belt fed machine guns to the revolutionary war. Even if aegon's invasion has a good chance, it's still taking a chance. whereas combat with dragons on your side is about as close to a sure thing as can be. Sure, something could happen to the dragons. There's risk in everything. But the odds heavily favor invading with dragons
wow. starting your own **successful** software company at 17, reaching 1 mill by 24 all the while supporting your family that include a parent with a disability. That is amazing. When i was your age i was chasing tail and going into debt. 
ya, that's what i'm leaning toward. a small house that can eventually be a rental. as far as using the 75k for a duplex down payment - if i plan to maintain my current house i think i would be way over the limit on debt to income ratio to get a loan on a duplex

when starting nymphing, the biggest thing that surprised me was how much tippet is necessary between the fly and the indicator. in fast water you need 2.5 times the depth. so in 2 feet of water you need 5 feet between fly and indicator. in slow water the minimum is just the depth.  also, weight weight and more weight. i almost always use a bead head nymph at the bottom and like you probably guessed, in faster water you need more weight to get it down quicker

Currently deploying ACI in two data centers. One unforeseen internal debate that arose was where the layer 3 should live. If the L3 lives on the firewall then you lose a lot of what ACI brings to the table which is the holistic view of the application.  Firewalls need to be stitched in rather than service graph. \n\nAlso, you need very specific information about what certain applications are talking to beyond just IPs. For instance an app may  talk to a web server, a database, etc and all that info can be hard to get from outside vendors trying to protect their intellectual property. The only real way around this is to also deploy tetration which would allow you to reverse engineer that information.\n\nIt's all object oriented config where absolutely everything has to be configured in the abstract, but theoretically in the end it will make day to day operation as well as troubleshooting much easier. Ask me again in a few months and I might have a different answer haha
don't go to college. apprentice with a contractor and learn how to build. i know a guy who was a contractor and in his spare time would build his own rentals. he did most of the work himself and traded favors with buddies when he needed a subcontractor (electrician, plumbing, etc.). every house that he built was immediately worth significantly more than he paid for it. in real estate everyone talks about how money is made when you find the place - finding a property for a great deal - foreclosures, distressed owners, etc. With his plan, he didn't have to wait for the stars to align to find a good deal - he used his own expertise to make a deal. by his early 50s he had 20 rental properties all paid for.  and on top of all that, the places were brand new. he didn't have to worry about unexpected and expensive repairs for at least 5 years on each place. and when repairs did need to be made, he could do most of them himself\n\nalso - keep in mind that if you want to get into rental properties you're going to have to start by leveraging debt. hopefully you have a way to pay for college because that's going to be hard to do if you've got $100k in student loans

i think we have to accept that the dragon horn is a red herring. it's not going to work. here's the logic: if the dragon horn does work and euron/victarion is successful, then that would be too big of a plot point to cut out of the shows. the dragons are the most exciting part. one of them being stolen and ridden by one of the ironborn would be way too big too cut. therefore we can logically assume that they are not successful and the horn won't work

i believe that love can overcome anything, but if you're going to marry this girl you owe it to yourself understand what's in store for you. You two obviously don't see eye to eye about finances. this WILL be a major point of contention in your marriage. 57% of divorces cite money as the main cause. The dating phase of your relationship will be the easiest time you ever have with her. If this is causing conflict now, rest assured it will cause even more after the wedding. You two can get through this. But it will be a long and hard road. If you're going to commit to her you should be honest with yourself and understand what you're in for.

there's a lot of good access points. the easiest is to just go to the dam. it has a parking lot and easily caught stocker size fish. there's also a path that leads just downriver to the stairs - it's a really scenic and wadeable area where fishing is similar to that at the dam. the next access point is the Lancaster pulloff, then Betty's Island, the train trestle, the rest area, betty's island.... like i said, a lot of river access.

if you are wanting to increase the range of your taste in certain foods, there are three tricks that i've found that help.\n\n1. Start easy. For instance, if you want to learn to like tomatoes, you don't have to dive straight into to eating a whole tomato raw. Ease into it - try some tomatoes on a taco, eat other foods with tomatoes incorporated with many other things. \n\n2. When trying new foods, try them when you are VERY hungry. There's something about being extremely hungry that makes almost any food taste good.\n\n3. If you're going to try something new, try the good stuff. For instance, if you want to learn to like tuna, don't start with the canned mush stuff. Get some high grade tuna and find a recipe that looks appetizing

i honestly don't know all the factors for generation but there have been ongoing repairs for the past few years. the water level jumps up about 9 feet when generating. the constant on and off schedule really affects the fishing. when this happens, the big fish go hide whenever the water goes down and come out to play literally as soon as the water starts rising. really makes fishing hard if you don't have a boat. the fishing really takes off when the schedule evens out - whether generators are frequently off, or always on, the fishing improves. that's perhaps why this fall has been so good. the rainfall has been low so they haven't been generating as much

And by that, i mean i wish i would have figured out a way to have a more steady side income while i was in music. i have a friend who got a degree to be a pharmacist, but he's a working guitar player. pharmacists are always in high demand. he's got a job where he can make his own hours and work whenever he's not on the road playing music. he's done well for himself and even though i don't know a lot about his finances, i'm pretty sure he's FI
the TWRA has been doing some really good work since the early 2000s that has affected this river. first of all, they've got some good limits on what fish people can take. second, they've been working with the army corp of engineers to get better water flows and generation schedules. and last, they've figured out a few tricks - for instance, they've found that stocking smaller fingerling browns in late fall/early winter results in a better survival rate instead of stocking larger (8 - 10 inch) brown in the spring. obviously it takes a few years for fish to grow that large and to see the fruits of the TWRA's labor. I personally would love to see a one mile "trophy section" that is fly fishing only and mandatory catch and release. Or at the very least a seasonal trophy section to protect the larger trout in the fall when they come in shallow to spawn. it's worked so well for other rivers all over the country. There's even a trophy section on the Hiawassee in east tennessee

 I've been there my friend. The guilt you feel is so real, but you can't let it control you. It's there as a reminder to stay on the right track, but you can't let it eat at you until you can't go on. You have to use the feeling of guilt as a motivator for your life, and a reason that you can be better person. So don't try to throw it away, but control it. \n\n When I was in your shoes, I had to let go of that old relationship. It had been years since I dated that girl, but I still felt the guilt. But I realized that I couldn't change what I had already done. And I knew that I was better than that. So I used that guilt to drive me to be a better person. And now, even though I'm single, I know that I'm better than I was, and I'm ready for another relationship. \n\n So, in short, use that guilt to drive you forward. Don't look back at what's happened. Just keep improving, and you'll eventually move past it.

I am just speechless. Congratulations on that amazing technique. And thank you for the video, I'll watch it multiple times!
Fake, I own an Android and my butt looks nothing like that.
Your definition of basic isn't universally accepted, and people who think that way don't go very far in Jiu Jitsu, since basic techniques can take you a long way. Your smart mouth does you no favors here, or on the mats. And if your flair is correct, I'd be very careful with it, it might lead to those bruises I mentioned earlier.  \nBut I guess I can always learn from you, let me see if I understood with an example of my own:\n"Your basic bjj skills are probably not enough to discuss naming conventions yet." How's that?
> I've wasted a good 15 minutes finding that out for you.  \n\nIf you had said you wasted 17 minutes, you'd have gotten 2 golds.\n   
This is probably the best LPT I've seen here in months.
I don't know if you did this for sarcasm, but I just have to do it.  \n*its way. 
Now you're rear-ending his daughter.
All answers on that sub should start with this.
Yes, but look relaxed so you look cool like a black belt, when you're actually kicking and screaming like a white belt. Just more gracefully at it.

One I came to realize a shirt while ago was folklore. It's folk lore, or people's stories. I'm curious to a genuine answer on this question too.
Yes, but not in the middle of the food, which seems to be the problem with Kinder Eggs.
'Cause this is Thriller!
How do you do this? It's amazing! Did you by any chance do a timelapse on this or another drawing of yours? Congrats!!
Been there. The one off Douglas. This burger isn't it though. This one looks nicer tbh.
True. But all other places who have it legalized by now certainly also have lousy drivers, it's not exclusive to Houston. And these places are not only going strong, they're making A LOT of money out of it and improving community quality of life.  
Thanks for the LOL.  \nHow do you like that silver? 
Thank you, came here to look for a comment like yours. I'm not politically affiliated to any party, but it doesn't really strike me right to see government employees promoting their political views using official channels. Do it on your own accounts, you're free to do that.
My problem with him so far is he takes too long to analyze and throw. But that can be fixed, I'm hoping for him to be better next season.

Good point.

Well, if the user refunds... Then it really didn't sell, did it? Everything is returned, including taxes...  
My computer has an inbuilt laptop, then.
The first one gave me an error, I thought it hadn't gone through. I tried again in a different spot. My bad.
Actually, they do need to be universally accepted. Or they wouldn't be part of a language, and basically it would be chaos. And I never said it couldn't have more than one. I mentioned the one you said it did was not among those. \nAnd by the way, you can't split a room by asking people to define "literally". Given it can have different senses is ok. But the general meaning will not change. Some of them will be wrong, and that's it.
Love it. Did you do a diagram by any chance?
Found the Silicon Valley fan.  \nBeat me to the comment, take an upvote.
Yes. We can. (Reaches for pepper spray)
I wish we could define work hours for messages to arrive. Let me explain: I have colleagues contacting me outside my working hours. While I don't want to block them entirely, I don't want WhatsApp to receive the message until I'm during work hours (or I go manually check for new messages). And vice-versa would be useful too, so your friends don't distract you at work.
Thanks for this. I was sure the pic had been airbrushed. I stand corrected.
If it's edible, it's ok. But toys? No way!!
I enjoyed the mechanics, the graphics, but the game burned out very quickly for me. After yesterday, I had had enough of it, probably not buying it till price comes way down.
Think of Elliott without the T sound.
Buy this game now. I get $0 for saying this, but I got it thanks to a gaming youtube channel I follow and it's awesome! It's got a Matrix bullet time system (everything moves super slowly unless you move), and you feel like a movie action hero. Plus, story is intriguing!
Beautiful colors, OP! Well done!
Everything is possible with enough lube.
I thought you were talking about the experience, not the story. I am not blaming you, it was my bad. Just hope I didn't read enough to understand, lol.
It has the option, but you have to set it every time. It's annoying.
COOL!
Found the married guy.
No, it's just a thought.
Very well put. As a gamer, I thrive on the experience. What the game looks like, how it plays, its story, are completely detachable parts as long as playing it brings me pleasure somehow.
A pet snake, for sure. She's terrified of those.
I don't smoke pot, but I do think it should be legal. Generates taxes, regulates quality, eliminates risk. It's a no-brainer. IMHO.
Plus, it's Canadian Dollars, right? They're what, $5.99 a pound? \n/s
I usually smirk when I hear that. I don't do it on purpose, it's just my natural reaction.
So whom (or in this case whomever) is always for an uncertain target (let's say any, if there's even any) while who would be to a determined person, as in I don't know exactly who, but somebody did?  \nEdit: I'm asking, trying to understand this better once and for all.
I'd gladly slap them, and I wasn't even born in Texas.
Voldemort was cocky, really. Deep down, he wanted to prove he could beat Harry in the game to keep the undefeatable atmosphere megalomaniacs like him like to sport.
It's awesome, and I think it's very nice of you to volunteer, OP, but I hate that they use volunteer work for this. It shouldn't even be allowed.
At this point, I'm more amazed how much it matters to you to not admitting you're wrong, rather than making a fool of yourself. But my morning is really slow, so what the hell.  They ARE universally the same, because they don't disagree on how to use it. The fact they word it differently doesn't change anything. They both mean basically or fundamentally the same thing (see what I did there?) \nA slang means it's informal, I never said they're not real or not used.  Just said it's not a part of the whole definition, which you will find put in different ways almost in as many dictionaries as you look, hopefully. They will still, basically, have the same idea, though. Now you're resorting to putting words in my mouth so you can "win" the discussion. \nI kind of get that feeling, after all, we both train this competitive sport and just love putting your limits to the test.  \nOn the other hand, there's no big theory to disprove, no big victory or prize here. If it's so important to you, there, I'll tap out. You win. Even though I don't lose. Sorry to disappoint.

I know it is not hard, but it's North Korea, I mean, I did read before there's like 60 computers with internet in the whole country...
Out of curiosity, what resolution were you using? I played Witcher 3 on Ultra, but at 2540x1440, pretty much steady 60fps. On 4k it'd go to 15, maybe 20.
This is the aspect of the gane that bugs me the most. Not only that, but the fact sometimes a nasty Synth is ripping you apart, you kill it, only to find it was shooting you with a vanilla Institute Rifle, Dmg ~20.
And I can totally see that, there are perks for sure. You probably get to see at least part of the game, even if just a glimpse, you're building resume, you get the chance to bump into the big stars and maybe even get an autograph. You are doing nothing wrong. My real indignation lies with the event organizers even having the guts to get volunteers for something that nets them billions.
Super Mutant Sweat. Green! Strength +6, Int -8.
It might not. And it definitely is. But hey, Oxford doesn't say boring anywhere, and Cambridge lists it as a slang (popular, not academic). And you probably do know more English than I do, given I'm brazilian. \nBut it doesn't change the fact using a synonym as a false motivator won't get you anywhere. You'll probably have found out by the third time scissors sweep is taught on Fundamentals class (or whatever you wish to call it) that they're trying to get you to learn the basics. Which, by the way, means the same (again, word of the day: synonym, my initial point).\nGot it? Or would you like me to try and draw you something?
What if only one of them is gay?
What I usually do is try and ignore it, but when I see the unread messages there, I'm compelled to go and read them. I wish I didn't even get them until I'm actually working. When they're muted, do you still get the msgs?
I never heard of that.
More like/r/crappydesign. It repeats options without offering different outcomes, should have taken you back upwards sooner.

But they did use the term free State, it's actually in the text I posted above. Trust me, I googled it :D.  \nPerhaps also they used the political concept of state, rather than the subdivision meaning we usually think if these days.

But they're literally the same thing. From Google:\nBasic - forming an essential foundation or starting point; fundamental.  \nBut answering OP's question, see what you like. It's not really possible to know them all in detail. Mastering a guard takes time and effort (not to mention letting go of ego, because you will very likely be smashed a lot at first).\nChoose one you think you can work with, and in which it feels natural to move to, and especially, one that favors your game.\nThen drill that f*cker to exhaustion. Go home, cry, put some ice on bruises, repeat.  \nJiu Jitsu is repetition.  \nJiu Jitsu is repetition.  \nJiu Jitsu is repetition.  \nJiu Jitsu is repetition.  \nJiu Jitsu is repetition.  \nYou get the idea.  \nEDIT: Formatting. 
Actually, I'm not even mad. That's amazing! In the sense they actually do know enough programming to do that. And here I was thinking those claims to be advanced in tech was just propaganda.

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! Other than the flair, how about adding that black square? I think I just read something I shouldn't have. I hope I didn't read it right.

Holy f*** that makes me think
I was fixing a girl's computer at her place after a class one day. Reinstalling Windows on a PC she got from someone riddled with viruses and what not. As I'm doing so, we're just chilling on her couch. Her last roommate there had just left for class. We end up talking about how the laptop probably got so many viruses. She then proceeds to start talking about how one of her friends has never seen Bangbros. And literally right afterwards asked me if I've ever done anal. I looked her and said something along the lines of "ha nah" super cazz(casual). And finished reinstalling Windows and left. It was only weeks later I realized how stupid I was. 
Hell no. Just don't get caught by one

The handling in NFS is indeed garbage, the Crew's is still worse. Just giving my opinion, not forcing you to agree with it. 
I've actually seen this car on the highway before. I gotta say it fooled me (from ~60 yards away)
I don't know much about Trackmania but I would argue that NFS is a better game than the crew. The graphics are better, the car's handling is better, better customization (NFS has an actual vinyl editor). But anyway there's Assetto Corsa, iracing, BeamNG and Project Cars on PC if you're into sim racing. If you have an Xbox one, I'd recommend Forza Horizon 2 over The Crew. Don't get me wrong The Crew was fun when it came out and I was hyped for the wildrun update but it fell flat for me.

I don't see how it's a BS argument at all. You're looking at close to $400 after  buying a game (zelda) and tax. You can literally buy a used Xbox one for $200 after tax now. You can buy a nice tablet and a controller for $200-250ish. Plus you're also going to want an SD card for your switch, and the joycon price is just a joke. They should take out the "HD rumble" if that's why it's so expensive and I guarantee they would sell more. Many people we're expecting $250 with a bundled game such as 1,2 switch. Not a $300 standalone console. If you can't see why that's disappointing you're either rich or a blind nintendo fan.

What year?  I don't know about the ZJ, but in the WJ (99 - 04), the front door speakers only put out the low frequencies.  The tiny speakers up front are full range (yep, full.  Not just tweeters).  The rear door speakers are full range.  \n\nSo, if replacing the front doors, only worry about the low frequency range.

I had my windshield replaced when a rock hit it.  Mine is an Overland and has the rain sensor attached, so was a bit more expensive than normal.  Insurance doesn't cover windshields in GA.  So ~$200 all told.   The guy did a REALLY good job.  I'd recommend going that route.

I switched all mine out to Gorillas.  Those, I think.  \n\nI also got the Gorilla locking lug nuts, but the too late discovered that the key to remove them is 5/8 hex instead of 3/4 hex.  Couldn't use the stock lug wrench.  So replaced them with a different brand.  But if you're already using a cross to remove your lug nuts, it isn't an issue.
Exactly.  I don't understand the excitement over RTTs on top of the vehicle.  Now on a trailer, that would be nice.

When we buy an audio cassette, CD, DVD, Blu-RAY, downloadable file, etc., we aren't just buying the media, but the license to enjoy the content.  Included in that end-user license is the right to make a back-up copy, in case the original media is lost or damaged.  Your license is not limited to the original media.  That's the legal contract.  In fact, included in the cost of the CD, etc., is a small fee to compensate the industry for lost sales due to end-users making EXTRA copies and giving them away to others,\n\nAs soon as the first CD and DVD were encrypted to prevent the end-user from making a copy, THE MUSIC INDUSTRY BROKE THAT CONTRACT.  Therefore, we are no longer under obligation to abide by the contract, either.  \n\nSo, fuck 'em.

State Parks usually run about $15/night (more or less, depending on the area), and provide water, electricity, a picnic table in your spot, and a community shower house.  Some have a "tent" area away from the RV spots.
I think all the guys catch the irony here.
What they learned from this incident is that they can continue to pull this shit and get away with it. Overstep the bounds and apologize later.  Even if they must later pay a fine, it pales in comparison to the extra benefit gained from doing the wrong thing. Despicable company.

A solder connection that connects the display screen to the circuit board is coming loose.  If you hit that display screen with the palm of your hand, it will light up again for a while.  I did that for a year or so before replacing the head unit.  \n\nPro Tip: If you replace it, you'll want to get an adapter kit for the steering wheel controls.  What those adapter kits do is connect the steering wheel buttons to a programmable box that replaces the remote control that comes with the new head unit.  If the remote control that comes with the new head unit does not have a particular function, you CANNOT make the steering wheel buttons do it.  I replaced mine with a Kenwood unit. The remote control does not have a function for cycling through the radio presets.  So, the buttons on the left side of the steering wheel don't cycle through my presets - they just go up and down the available frequencies.  so, if you are going to replace it, make sure the remote control on the new unit cycles through presets and does all of the other things you want.
See one, do one, teach one.
Age is just a number
I have the same experience ('03 Overland), even with barely any tread left on the all-seasons.  Now that I have 30.5" all-terrains, I'm really looking forward to some snow driving!
Yeah, I was hoping replacing the windshield (had a huge crack) would have fixed it.  
The engine can run even with a crack.  It may blow smoke, or lose a little power, but it can still run.  It can even run well, depending on where it is and how small.  
My experience, with a variety of vehicles, has always been the exact opposite.  From basic 70s sedans to modern technological marvels.\n\nThe original advice about connecting to a grounding point was good advice when batteries were not sealed and explosive gasses leaked out of the batteries.  When you connect that second cable to the battery - kaboom!  But with sealed batteries, it's not an issue.
To clean the tube, remove it from the bladder, remove the nipple, run water through it, get a length of paracord, tie a knot in one end, drop the unknotted end through it, grab hold of the unknotted end, pull the knot through.  Repeat until satisfied.
I have rough country 1.5" adapter spacers with 245/70R17 (30.5") tires on my WJ.  They were rubbing the front of the wheel well liner a TINY bit, and the shocks a TINY bit before the adapters. No rubbing now. If the dimensions of the WK are similar, I'm quite sure you will need adapter spaces with tires that wide (245 vs 265).
Here is something else most don't know - when we stream or download music, movies, etc. without paying for it, we are NOT "pirating" or violating copyright law.  The copyright is really only violated when one distributes a copyrighted work for profit.\n\nBut as a friend and I agreed the other day, "right" or "wrong, "legal" or "illegal" doesn't amtter much in these cases. He who has the most money wins the battle in court.

Just tie an overhand knot loop.

How did it do?
Built 360.  Same block, lots of good aftermarket parts.

1.  I've visited a few countries, staying in hotels, and meeting the locals and travelers from all over the world.  I've found that everyone is basically the same, we just speak different languages (except the exclamation "Wow!" seems universal).  Have you found the same, or have you encountered a culture that was difficult to understand and empathize with?\n\n2.  What would you say, all things considered (cost, culture, politics, opportunity for adventure, ease of travel, etc.), is the best country to live in?  In the U.S., the best town/city or state?
Grand Cherokee WJ (99-04) with QuadraDrive.  I don't know if QD was available with the I-6.  The 4.7 v8s are nice as long as you keep up on maintenance and never let them overheat.\n\nWhat about a 4Runner or a Tahoe?
I agree that it doesn't seem to be as well made, and pots are not as stable on it as the MSR PR, but it's never broken on me and I've never had anything fall off.\n\nAs for the fuel, JetBoil, MSR, or Coleman, small or large canister.
THIS IS THE CORRECT LPT\n
How many units of each game have been delivered?
He gets to stack from now on.
I have an Overland with UC suspension.  I put on a 2" Budget Boost from Rocky Road Outfitters with the same size tires.  I put on their shocks a year later.  I wish I had put on the new shocks at the same time as the lift. DEATH WOBBLE!  You don't want to experience that.  It's scary as f@$k.  \n\nI just added 1.5: Rough Country adapter spacers.  When I did, I noticed the tiniest bit of rubbing on the shocks and front trim.  Nothing that ever caused any problems, but there is no rubbing now.  While the ride is a little more stable, the extra width of the stance somehow made the tires look smaller.\n\nI chose the budget boost and spacers over new springs and offset wheels because they were relatively inexpensive to add, easy to take off, and can be removed without needing to buy any new parts (if the old parts weren't saved.
Cargo carrier.  Don't get a roof box.  Putting things on the roof increases aerodynamic drag and significantly reduces mpg.  Also with the ZJ, you want to get that spare tire out of the cargo carrier.  Consider getting a hitch-mount spare tire carrier (with an extension that allows you to put on the cargo carrier).
We got even less than that in Augusta - zero, nada, zilch.
Remember - these are CHEAPER fares.   If you aren't bringing a carry-on bag that needs to go into the overhead bind, you aren't going to be charged for that amenity.  If you want that amenity, buy the regular ticket that you have been.\n\nThis is a GOOD thing. 
2" - 2.5" lift, 31" All-Terrain tires, new shocks
I agree with all this.
She talked about her close relationship with God for an hour.  Hardly looked at me, never once asked me a question after the initial greeting.
The Home version doesn't allow that.
No, I have noticed this as well.  80-90% of the time, the men's is farther away.  Also, if the two are an equal distance away, the men's is on the right.
I would modify that a bit - Be very smart, but not try to impress or intimidate me with it.  Use it to enhance the conversation.
They've run out of all other options and ideas. It's hilariously sad. I've got to watch my sodium levels because i'm overdosing on their tears every single day.
I had a 98 (same generation).  Wish I hadn't sold it.  It's a great size.  Big enough to hold lots of gear, long enough that you can sleep comfortably in the back after folding down the seats, but small enough on the outside that you can go on trails that will scratch up or block the full size vehicles and good clearance.\n\nThe check engine light is probably something to do with emissions, like an 02 sensor or something like that. You can find the code by borrowing a scanner at your local auto parts shop (Advance Auto, AutoZone, etc.).  \n\nWhat's nice abut the v8 is that, because it's the 302, you can put a lot of Mustang parts on it for more power and possibly even better gas mileage.\n\nI'd recommend Firestone Destination AT tires.  Smooth on road, great wet/dry traction on-road and off, good tread life, MUCH cheaper than Michelin.\n\n
No shit.  That's the fuckin' bell curve.  
I have an '03.  I've only needed to replace the fronts (twice each in 10 years), never the rears, oddly.  I guess it's because they just rarely get used.  It seems to me that the $100 versions have lasted longer than the $80 versions.  Those with a metal "window holder" plate rather than a plastic one.  The break is always on the cable, but I suppose it's just that if a company is willing to use a cheaper plastic part to hold up the window, they are willing to use a lower quality metal for the cable.\n\nAs for door clips - be careful when you order.  Not all WJs used the same part #.
I have a leak issue with mine.  It's not the windshield, it's not the heater core, it's not the A/C drain.\n\nThere is a hole in the body underneath the bottom left corner of the windshield, where the hinge for the hood is.  If I pull back the carpet, I can shove a hose in that pocket and see the water leaking into the cabin.  It's a tiny leak, and it really isn't a bother unless there are leaves and stuff in there that diverts water to the hole.  Then the footwell can really fill up during heavy rain.  It's in a hard to reach spot, or I would have patched it with JB weld or something like that already.
Curious - when you had the engine replaced, how was it done?  Did you just get a rebuilt long block and swap the rest over, or did you get a complete new engine with a new intake manifold, throttle body, fuel rails, all the sensors, etc? \n\nIf the former, then all the sensors & little things (Throttle Position Sensor, MAP sensor, PCV valve, IAC valve, oil pressure sensor), fuel injectors, possibly the spark plug cables.\n\nI'm coming up on 180K on my engine.  It's had the heads resurfaced once, but has a blown head gasket again.  Just leaking some coolant into one or more cylinders, not into the crankcase, so nothing terrible yet.  I'm actually getting better than new mpg, so I'm not in a hurry to do something, but the time will come.  So any info you can give me on how you went about getting the engine replaced and the cost would be great.\n\nHave you replaced the shocks?\n\nI'm surprised you didn't list the front wheel hub assemblies.  Those usually go out before 200K.  \n\nHow about the diff & transfer case fluids?  I always have mine (also an Overland) done at the dealer to make sure the oil & friction modifier are done right.
In any case, because your dealer broke it, and have admitted to it, they are responsible for the cost of getting it fixed.  They have tried and failed.  It's time to take it somewhere else.  Your dealer is then responsible for either paying the bill or reimbursing you for it.  If you take it to another dealer, I would explain the situation and see if they would arrange to bill the first dealer directly. \n\nNote: I am not a lawyer.
I was being facetious
Exactly.  And as another poster noted, knives, handguns, and even sticks are weapons of war.
I speak from experience.  There have been times backpacking with my friends when my stove fired up more quickly and easily than theirs - MSRs, Colemans, JetBoils, other brands.  Some with JetBoils just gave up on theirs and borrowed mine when I was done.
Considering it's an option on some vehicles, and not even available on most, I can't believe it would be dangerous to drive on the highway without one.  
Yes, those are factory
But what if I don't like watching sports?
Slotted and drilled rotors don't provide any benefit.  The effect of the increased cooling is exactly offset by the reduced friction due to reduced surface area.  \n\nThe number of pistons doesn't matter, either. At least not when you are comparing brake systems with same size pads.  What matters here is the amount of pressure put on the pads.  \n\nThe position of the caliper (in front or behind the axle) doesn't matter.\n\nThe biggest factor is increased surface area, and the best way to do that is to get bigger rotors, calipers, and pads.  There are kits for this, but you may need to get bigger wheels to fit around the bigger rotors.  Adaptors/spacers MAY help avoid the need for bigger wheels.  \n\nMake sure your brake fluid is clean and "dry"  (use a tester to verify the level of water in the fluid is within acceptable levels).
You said you just had the tires replaced.  Could one of the balancing weights have fallen off?  It happens.\n\nAlso, you may have had a bad tire installed and the tread has separated.  \n\nthe way to be sure your wheels/tires are to blame is to swap them front to back.  If the vibration changes or goes away, you have isolated the issue.

When I was about 6?, the doctor taught me to pull it back a little bit each day, just a tiny bit more than the previous day, until I was able to pull it all the way back.\n\nRemembering the situation, it was kind of funny.  I can't remember how the topic came up at the doctor (pediatrician) visit.  Maybe I was just at the age where it was appropriate to check if the foreskin was separating from the glans (head). So he explained what I needed to do.  I didn't understand what he was trying to tell me, so Mom tried to explain.  I still didn't get.  So they had me pull down my pants and try.  I was still confused.  The doctor got really embarrassed and looked at my Mom with a questioning look and a motion of his hands to ask permission to actually demonstrate.  He was in his 60s and must have been a pediatrician for a while, so to think this embarrassed him gives me a chuckle now. She said "of course", with no hesitation.  Mom is very practical, and this was long before everyone was so hyper-vigilant and thought every man was out to rape & molest women and children. So he, sort of reluctantly, took my little guy in his hands and showed me what to do.  Then it became obvious and I told them that I understood.  No, he didn't continue or anything like that. He let me go and I pulled my pants back up. I wasn't embarrassed at all, by the way.  \n\nSo I did that and am glad I did. \n\nThere is a lot of info on the net about this and how to do it.
This worked well for me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUUgR94drxg
Yes.\n\n
If the kit really only came with two guy lines (as in he picture), I believe their intent was for you to cut them to the desired lengths.  \n\nAs noted by recovering_pessimist, the design of this tarp is not favorable to a continuous ridgeline.  
Because they don't accept the evidence that is being presented as true.  There is something that tells them all of the evidence and arguments don't add up to the claim that the Earth is warming beyond control and/or that humans are causing it.  Either because they don't trust the quality of the information or the honesty of the sources, or because competing information sounds plausible as well.
1.5" Rough Country wheel adapter/spacers.  Doesn't look as good as I thought it would.  But it is more stable and tracks straight better.
I forget the amount - $500?  $1000?  We agreed he'd pay it back by a certain time ( a month?).  He didn't. I had to guilt him into repaying (about a month later).  We never spoke again.

I think it's simply because the majority of girls care more about it.\n\nYou see, when you care more about something, you put more time and effort into it.  Kind of like walking.  Drunk people don't care if they walk straight, so they just stumble and away all over the place.  Or fish.  Fish don't care about blowing bubbles as much as kids, so their bubbles aren't nearly as awesome.   
Isn't amazing that the Grand/Cherokees are actually a bit smaller than the CJs/Wranglers, yet can hold more passengers and cargo and, when similarly built, go the same places?  (OK, maybe not the WK with its IFS, but pretty darn close).\n\n\n
You were probably too amiable and available.  Agreeing with everything, never challenging her beliefs or stances. Responding too quickly, too ready and willing to change your plans to suit hers.  If you're just a wet blanket that is always within reach, she can put you aside and come back to you whenever she wants - which will be never because there are too many other guys out there attracting her attention.  In other words, don't go to her (mentally, emotionally, physically), make her come to you.

*Seriously.*\n\nThey're so blind. It's almost hilarious...in a very sad way.
Why is she not 50 points ahead..!
Oh they already lost their entire part for me back in as the inauguration began. After what I've seem, there's literally *nothing* they could *ever* do to get me to vote for *any* of their candidates. again. The fact that half of the DNC isn't sitting in prison right now and instead are continuing with their ruthless agenda of ruining this country its just insane.
The MSM is extremely dangerous for these reasons. Since Trump started his campaign, it's become more and more obvious. It's abysmal and they need to be held directly accountable for the widespread violence and treason they are committing.\n\nThere is a huge market opening right now for proper entrepreneurs to create a solid new news network that truly doesn't have an agenda and just reports the facts. Back every tiny ass thing you say up with as many other "good" sources so there is zero debate. (These idiots are hard to convince of anything they don't already agree with).
Their fake 'problems' with Trump is that he is effectively censoring others...\n\n\n.....So they censor millions of Americans in 'retaliation'......\n\nTheir salt......it's almost too much. RIP imgur. Too bad you don't realize that you'd be nothing without Reddit. *nothing*. You literally built your company entirely thanks to leeching off Reddit traffic. You are nothing. lmfao. *such* cucks hahahhhahaahh
I wonder if you were this vocally opposed when Obama took golf trips in Hawaii for weeks at a time. At least when Trump plays golf, he's doing it with heads of state and making deals with them -- not his pals shooting the shit.
The fact that they think this is 'okay' to do to someone you don't like appalls me. We need to drain the *fuck* out of this nasty, nasty swamp.
dang you're so tolerant and accepting of other people

Yeah, what a schmuck. Supporting the President of the country that he lives in and all. Being extremely excited to be personally invited by him up on stage in front of thousands of people. Yeah. So deplorable.\n\n\nFuck that twitter twatter guy whoever he is. 
oh you mean the social media patterns that companies are publicly and privately manipulating against Trump and the tens of millions of Americans that support him? Yeah I'd imagine that would skew the statistics chief.
Much of this is courtesy of http://ShariaBlue.com. They've realized the  political potential and ROI to dedicate lots of effort into driving their agenda.\n\n:(
They're even coming for our comments. Pathetic domestic terrorist fucks. No way you can consider yourselves to be Americans when you pull this kind of shit time and time again. Perhaps one day your eyes will open up and you'll realize how damaging you were single-handedly being to this country.
Look at the home page of http://Uber.com. Lol. The message they have across the top. It's both. For *sure*. In fact, it was Uber first. Despite Kalanick being on Trump's team (for a short amount of time), his right-hand man Ryan Graves (the first person they hired) has been openly vocal against Trump and pro-Hillary since day one.\n\nIt's safe to say that all SF based companies are cucked beyond belief.

Hmm. Reminds me of when *all* of Reddit's /r/all was made up of T_D posts!\n\nTotally coincidental error I'm sure. Not like they were pushing updated  code that a dev fucked up..
I agree but only in the utmost strict sense of zero violence (unless absolutely necessary for the sake of your life or an innocent person in your vicinity of course).\n\nOne thing liberals have lacked since day one is *logic*. Let's use some of that and potentially innovate some powerful, effective ways to get our message across.
Yo this is sick! I really REALLY regret not going for this wonderful life experience. I live across the country (AZ) but nothing was holding me back from going. Nothing. I have the time and the money and i'm beating myself up for not going. So thankyou for sharing your first hand experience.
If they know what's best for this country they'll cut the shit..
Whether you like him or not you have do admit, *he* is living the American dream. He is. He did what makes America so great in the first place, he became an entrepreneur. He became an *extremely* successful entrepreneur -- he made a *global* name for himself, his family and his company -- he's made *billions of dollars*.\n\nHe then decided to run for President of the United States to fix a broken democracy *and he won*. Whether you like him or not, you can't deny the fact that *he is living the ultimate life/dream any American can have*.\n\nIt's remarkable.

It's not as simple as that. And it boggles my mind that you think that this is some sort of 'excuse'. In the event where it was necessary due to *actual* government tyranny (not 'omg he said the word pussy over a decade ago in what he thought was a private conversation with his friend as he was just a lonely civilian billionaire!'), then not all the military would be on board. They aren't idiots that follow their orders blindly, especially if it's against their own people. Hmmm who would have thought, right!??!! And lol @ you thinking it would only be 1,000 in the actual event. I guess you're quite unaware of the gun industry :)\n\nLol at you thinking it's remotely that simple. Weapons are everything, that is why we have a 2nd Amendment, and that is why it *shall not be infringed.*\n\nGo back to your safe space.
Punch me bro. I'll be patiently waiting.
I have read that people worry about if they can keep it up with an influx in traffic. Does anyone know the owner? (is he or she okay with keeping it afloat and functional if it were to grow in the future)
Deplorables, swamp rats, irredeemable -- dang we've got a nice little collection of nick names to go by.
And regardless, even if he did break the law on said phone call, they were already recording it and monitoring him prior. Not saying it's right or whatever, just saying that does not excuse them for what they did to Flynn in the slightest unless they had probable cause prior.
Oh wow this tweet carries a spice level of about 2,200,000 SHU

Yeah these few sour apples need a proper reality check because our founding fathers are currently rolling around in their graves as they witness how these assholes are doing anything and everything to undermine and destroy this country.
Haha and yet another loss for *her*.\n\nfor the lulz, please run\n\n\nif you can in fact run from a prison cell that is. please. do it.
Abso-fucking-lutely.\n\nHis response to one question in general *really* kicked it off for me. Felt so fucking authentic and honest and real and for fucks sake I'm not kidding. Will need to re-watch it, forgot what question it was that I'm referring to. From then on out it was just onslaught.
oh nooo, that sucks
Same thing that they tried to do to Trump, basically. Sex crimes are the easiest to fake and tarnish ones image without having any proof of anything.
I've given up trying to convince these idiots otherwise. There's enough information out there if you're willing to research it and accept it for what it is. But people just like to base their entire thought process over the CNN headlines they see when their friend 'likes' it on facebook and that's that.
They should, you know, work on fixing their own countries. Just a thought.\n\nAnd the shills need to stop pushing Trump related shit to the top of /r/worldnews. Fuck off. Honestly. There are other subs for this, don't ruin this sub *too*.
Holy shit. What the fuck.\n\nAs if we needed another reason not to use them. Seriously though, what is wrong with these peoples mindset? It's despicable --- pulling maneuvers like this. So. Butthurt. They are single handedly doing their part in the destruction of this country. Unbelievable.
No. lol. not worth it to me. i can suffer. i don't fly often really either, but still. call me frugal but no way it's worth that much.
You would think, of all people, a former President of the United States would *respect* the way a democracy functions whether or not he agrees with every move. Because, you know, it's like a Democracy and stuff. (Well, it's supposed to be..)
Y'all were wrong the first time. Horribly wrong. Just you wait :)
I was gonna say....Seems like certain institutions have realized the potential ROI when coming to influencing Reddit..
I wish they would describe, in particular, *why* they think he is all of these things. Our media has been brainwashing the works and it's terrifying. It's even harder for people living across the pond to see what's going on (apparently).
They're never 'off duty', but there's a difference between simply 'not being off duty' and 'simultaneously making moves to better this country'. Crazy huh.\n\nOh and\n\n    Obama's trips and vacations cost in a year what Trump has forced on us in a month. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ohDKCIO.jpg\n\nThe media just never gave two shits about Obama's travel spending so in retrospect your brainwashed ass never gave two shits about it either. \n\nKeep on keepin on.\n\n
The most illegal shit on planet earth apparently is A-Okay as long as whoever did it fits their agenda.
They aren't *eliminating* anything. Jesus. Great fear-mongering word choice you have there.
Good call. Thanks man
Their web strategy is flawed for sure. Strictly from a business perspective.\n\nThere are many innovative ways they could be taking advantage of their massive overall traffic, ways that are much more efficient than just their self-serve advertising system. They can keep that too, but there are some very low-impact (hivemind wont get their pitchforks out for it) but would be noticeably more profitable. Noticeably.\n\nI'd love to help them take advantage of these things, but I don't think there's a way I could ever work with/for a company that censors *specifically* the President of the United States.
Ah! Yes! 'Pneumonia and overheating'! And then literally hours later she's caught on video leaving ~~the hospital~~ her daughters apartment, hugs a child that comes up to here (that totally wasn't a plant), then says quote "I'm feeling great, it's a beautiful day" when asked how she's doing.\n\nUn^fucking^believable
I'm not defending anything. We'll let the facts come out on this more than likely #fakenews agenda by CNN & NYT. Just like the piss 'scandal', or the thousands of other attempts to take Trump down. If it's true, that's terrible. And regardless, he lied under Oath. You don't lie to the VP. I'm not defending him.\n\nThat being said, it looks like many of you have completely given up on your own basic rights and freedoms acting like this is A-Okay. Come on.
Despite the bad apples, I am supremely confident in the amount of actual patriots in our intelligence communities, armed forces and police that simply won't let our generation see the downfall of such a great country.
Despicable. At least deleting your account only takes about two clicks.  Rest in piss you shitty company.
Negative. Do as OP says. They're simply imitating a 503 error whenever the referring URL is from the donald.\n\nIt's alright. they're further killing their own business that was built entirely off of leeching on reddit' straffic in the first place. they'd be nothing without reddit. they *are* nothing without reddit. lmfaooo
From a Secret Service perspective, that was quite the optimal location for his first/any rally. Have a lot less exterior square footage to secure. 
Which one was him? Either way. Good shit. There's teams of some hardddd hitters in some of those vans/SUVs. #Merica.
Do you have any idea how much power a $600MM government contract can get with AWS (Amazon Web Services)?\n\n\nThey're probably storing all of our phone calls for a certain long timeframe. Not kidding.
Too many people are trying their hardest to sabotage our democracy and this entire country. It needs to stop immediately. This cannot go on.
She will be the first female President. 2024 baby.
And the full support of the *huge* majority of our Military and Police etc.\n\nGood luck idiots. Or you could perhaps make a better life decision and invest your time and effort into actually helping this country and making it great again.
Black....female.....maybe some of the brainwashed idiots will awaken and realize we're not all mini-hitlers...
Visible
Unreal.\n\n:(
It's got about as much credibility as pissgate that the MSM pushed endlessly and Reddit cucks pushed...even...further.\n\nLmfao.\n\nWhat happened there, kiddos?
It's more than just a news website. They're infiltrating large social media websites (ie Reddit) to push their political agendas backed by people with some very deep pockets.
You know what they say!\n\n    "When all else fails, go on their subreddit & downvote all of the comments to show them our feelings & hide the truth!"
Thankfully we don't have to worry about that.
He's got my vote.
Oh nooo, that sucks
I "laugh" at people who want Trump to fail.\n\nIf you live in the United States, whether you like Trump or not you better fucking be hoping he's amazing and does wonders for our country. Wanting him to fail is wanting our country to fail, dumbies,
That would likely mark the end of this country. Too many people know what's up. Far too many.
There's a reason why she received *the most* faithless electoral votes ever as a Presidential candidate.
They should release transcripts so we can all decide for ourselves and form our own opinions other than the ones that [CNN tells us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DcATG9Qy_A).
Luckygunner did thousands of rounds very rapidly, though, which dramatically increases wear (which is why machine guns swap out barrels when they get hot). A casual shooter putting even 1000 rounds downrange over the course of a few hours won't have wear that dramatic.
Yeah i haven't yet. And i don't think i will. Just went shooting earlier today so I'm thinking a much more appropriate spot would be on one of my shooting bags or cases. \n\nI've got a purty '16 Audi Q5 so i'm not trying to have it fucked with. Plus while i live in a super nice place, it is parked in an indoor garage with all of the other people that live here. surely theres some cucks...if i had my own garage i totally would..
Dies in peace, in a prison cell. *Any* other American citizen would be in one -- would have already *been* in one for years -- if they did a minuscule fraction of what she has done.
Ugh I knowww. I was in DC for the first time just a couple months prior to the inauguration for some neat family related stuff that I was honored to be a part of. Any excuse to go back is a good excuse.\n\nI gotta say it made me feel all warm and fuzzy when you said the best part of this all was spending quality time with your dad. You're so right. What a great life experience you had. 
I just went shooting today for the first time in years. Have had guns all my life but yeah. I did better today than I ever did before lmfao. I was honestly SHOCKED especially because....\n\n a) I had to sight in my new AR-15's ironsights AND of course the sexy new eotech i picked up for it (just got the rifle. after seeing recent events unfold i figured it might be a worthwhile fun investment seeing as i had the same S&W M&P15 a few years back too).\n\nand\n\nb) I've ALWAYS sucked w/ handguns, not that I ever invested much time into them, just home defense stuff. But i've had numerous throughout my life, so just a few hours ago at the range when I was done with the rifle I decided to run a few mags out of my S&W 9mm Shield. Literally told myself "*this is going to be fucking terrible. i hope nobody is watching..*". Only had target set at 15ft for starters as a noob thats been out of the game for years... fuggin killed it. every time. i've never been this accurate before...\n\nI have no idea how this happened but i am not complaining. Trump made my shooting skills great again.
Currently:\n\n#11 on iTunes!\n\n#1 on Amazon!
Dangit i hate Trump for having multiple kids!! Why can't he just get rid of a couple???? Jeez
Un fucking believable. And these people think of themselves as Patriots.

That's because of all people, the military understands the magnitude of her OPSEC violations alone -- and how royally *fucked* any of you with a clearance would be if you did 1/1000th of what she has done in regards to handling classified information alone.\n\nCivilians just don't understand the magnitude of S/TS+ classified information, when they go to defend Killary they just play them off as 'oh just her emails' like it's overhyped or nothing special. When they couldn't be more fucking wrong. Partly due to Malik's brother for publicly saying how the emails were 'nothing out of the ordinary' or some shit....absolutely despicable what that party has done to this country.
Welcome to America my friend. Thank you for doing this the *legal* way, we're extremely happy to have you. One of us!
Sure is funny how every 'enemy' of the democratic party turns out, sooner or later, to have had some major sex scandal in the past.\n\nIs it someone or some party trying to tarnish someones image with zero proof? hmmmmmm that can't be true. they're nice people. it's not like they'd do whatever it takes to make the opposition fail whomever they may be, right?

This fuckstick is literally dipping his feet in any and all political agenda crap. When will this old domestic terrorist fuck die of old age, god damn.
You've convinced me to add the MAGA sticker to my car. been debating it honestly, dont want some tolerant left individual slashing my tires or something because they don't like the 3"x1" sticker of a 4 letter word, but I'll take my chances.

Refugees are welcome, so long as they can pass background checks and we can be sure they are not terrorists, terrorist sympathizers or proponents of dangerous ideology.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says that currently there is no way to vet refugees from the Middle East to ensure they are not terrorists or ISIS operatives, ISIS has declared an intention to infiltrate the west via the refugee stream, and ISIS has control of Syrian passport production facilities, *and* European intelligence agencies confirm ISIS operatives have infiltrated the refugee programs. The US doesn't owe non-Americans anything, and the US, like any nation, has the right to dictate who enters the country and under what circumstances. It is completely within the powers of the president to deem a class of immigrant too dangerous to national security to allow entry *and* Trump's ban on immigrants from 7 specific countries is only for 90 days until our federal agencies can establish a protocol for vetting refugees (and is based on the Obama administration's proposal for increased travel restrictions).
I didn't mean a left/right political dichotomy. I meant liberal ideals such as free speech, individualism, etc.\n\n> Nazis aren't just people who have bad ideas though.\n\nThey are, actually. You aren't just referring to the National Socialist German Worker's Party, after all. You're actually referring to anyone who has radical white nationalist or white supremacist beliefs and conferring the title "Nazi" on them. You're presuming a set of beliefs *and* actions that they may or may not hold and you aren't being discerning in your application of who is and is not a Nazi.\n\nThe man punched in this story was punched for the high crime of passing out fliers that the police said he had a right to pass out. He wasn't threatening anyone nor was he committing any criminal act in disseminating his beliefs. Yet because he was sharing a belief that the greater majority of people disagree with anyways he was assaulted and you're arguing that it's OK to do that.\n\nThat's wrong on a number of levels ranging from the philosophical to the legal to the practical. If you start going down this road where it is OK to use violence in the censure of politics that are repugnant (and that's all this was unless you can prove this man was in the process of committing a violent act) then you are justifying the use of violence in *all* politics. It starts with punching Nazis, progresses to violence against others you disagree with and extends all the way to [threatening the families of those that disagree with you](http://imgur.com/a/Ok3E5).\n\nIt justifies not only the riots at Berkley, but also attacks on anyone so long as you can justify attacking them for their beliefs.\n\nIf it is not wrong to punch a Nazi, then is it wrong to kill them? Nazis aren't the only one who hold dangerous beliefs, so is it wrong to punch or kill someone who is not a Nazi so long as they hold beliefs I find dangerous?
TX is actually in a pretty good spot for training classes. Check out Tactical Ranch; I've heard good things about them. The closer you are to DFW the better your findings. If you're willing to make the drive to KS there's a facility here that is a Gunsite pistol satellite facility and has some in-house training. It's also going to play host to Daniel Shaw this next month. \n\nInfidel Armor also hosts classes in TX, I think.
> Yes, even the woman, kids, grandmas and grandpas\n\nSi, even the *chicas*, *niños*, *abuelas* y *abuelos*.
Will he be wearing that body armor? 
I think the point being made is that you are going to make violence a huge part of liberalism if we're going to open the door to punching people who have bad ideas.
Looking at some of them offering 6 magazines I'm guessing they are offering 4 magazines with 10 round options for magazine restricted states.

No. They can tell if you're a member based on your email address and phone number. I use slippery.email for the first and a random phone number generator for the second.

>I believe Z prices his products based on the amount of resin/plastic used.\n\nWhich makes far more sense vs GW's pricing of models that should be simple to make and cheap in terms of materials cost. Seriously $87 for the same 5 Terminators they've been making for years?
That's not true, though. Everyone who is getting punched and labelled as "Nazi" hold varying beliefs and varying degrees of severity. This guy distributing fliers, do you think he believes in genocide? Or does he just hold wildly disagreeable views about race relations?\n\nI don't know who Richard Spencer is but as far as I can tell he doesn't support genocide; he supports a white ethnostate within America similar to how Israel is a Jewish state. That's a far cry from genocide.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos is a gay Jew with a penchant for black men. His conservatism does not translate to any form of white nationalist or supremacist ideology (in fact he supports reparations for black Americans) and yet he is also called a white supremacist and a Nazi and when he speaks people that believe as you do burn the city down.\n\nEven Ann Coulter, a woman who I find distasteful, supports some form of reparations for blacks but is called a Nazi because she doesn't support immigrants being able to share in the sympathies she gives black Americans descended from slavery. Does she deserve to be punched?\n\nIt's ludicrous that you're painting a broad brush on people with disagreeable ideas to justify something as severe as assaulting them.\n\nLet me ask you: if it is OK to punch them, is it OK to kill them?
Brandon Lee died on set when a prop gun with a fake projectile lodged in the barrel was loaded with a blank and fired at him.

Yeah, I really wanted to get a Griffin Armaments suppressor but I'm not jumping through extra hoops and I'm not going to wait 12 months. I'll just do without or bet on the HPA.
Damn, dog.
Outside of his "Dangerous Faggot" tour Milo typically presents very well reasoned arguments using statistics and logic. His appearances on television debating his view point are usually pretty respectful and it's his opposition that comes across as delusional when they can't answer his points (Kate Smurthwaite comes to mind). Even during his college talks he is very reasonable to people of a different viewpoint who ask him legitimate questions and is only offensive for comedy. Have you ever actually listened to what he's said? For content, I mean?
You're devolving the discussion to being solely about climate change and ignoring the greater implications of political information being screened before given to the people.

You'd be more believable if there weren't news organizations justifying the "punch a Nazi" meme and if left wing radicals weren't literally rioting in the streets to stop speakers from having their voice.
Fuck that, it took five years to arrive. That's a 2 star review.
Do you have any experience putting it through ARs? I've heard extraction issues are rife but I've also heard a little oil in the chamber solves it. I want to do *a lot* of training this year and anywhere I can reduce cost is better.
Trump's statement was, "Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too..." and he's right and it's something the US is criticized for heavily in all circles and on Reddit. Obama utilized extrajudicial killings of American citizens and covert drone wars overseas they may have resulted in more civilian deaths than Jihadis dead depending on whose definition you use. Yet when Trump points out that yes Putin is a person who has executed people covertly but the US doesn't have clean hands in this issue either it becomes Trump downplaying Russia's crimes. But I guarantee you if Trump had said, "America doesn't do that!" you'd have this thread flooded with examples.
I'm not too sure about anything in-state but nearby:\n\nhttps://www.gunsite.com/mobile-training-team/indiana-offsites/ - Indiana\n\nhttp://www.valorridge.com/ - Tennessee.

He travels around so maybe there's something you'd like to attend.

Wouldn't private funding for these organizations be just as good? If everyone who protested their defunding donated $5 wouldn't that solve the problem? Much like how European countries are working together to fill the void left by US funding in this case?

Japanophile friend of mine wants to do a Bretonnian army out of Samurai models. I hope he does because I'd love to paint them.
> It's a gimmicky kinda gun for me as I can't quite understand it's use other than "it's cool"\n\nIt gives you added stability over a pistol, folds up very compact for storage, takes magazines from popular pistols like Glock that people own anyway. What's not to love? Probably not as great as it was some years ago when it was hands down the most useful pistol caliber carbine around but it's still a great gun.
My brother gave me a gift card he got at work for showing up when a handful of others didn't in protest.
Because democracy is absolutely reliant on the ability of the people to be informed. What you are proposing is that it is better for media corporations to control what information is available to the public so long as it suits you with zero regard for the future implications of companies controlling politics or of the moral implications of removing the ability of the people to have their say in their governance.

The FBI is probably using a number of these sites for tracking pedophiles and finding abused children. Frankly, Anonymous may have done more harm than good if the pedophiles go to ground and set up shop somewhere else and abused kids don't get found.
I can see the benefit of living in a modest but affordable home in order to afford other luxuries. If I didn't have a family I'd live in a one bedroom loft apartment without hesitation.
I wonder if that reward applies to the MC's team as well.
I don't think that's quite how it works. The only historical source I am aware of that mentions a condition similar to what we know as PTSD suggests that the cure for it was to carouse with fellow soldiers and then get back at it. I've heard it theorized that PTSD was substantially less common back then because there would have been extended journeys home compared to today and having that extra time to decompress and come to terms with your experiences with people who share them may have a positive impact on the likelihood of suffering from PTSD.
To be fair though those same states are still the poorest in the Union.\n\nThere are economists who believe the South's economy didn't recover from the war until the 1950s.
Actually it was buying out Hollywood Video that did them in. The cost was so substantial they couldn't regain their footing. As pointed out, Netflix was hemorrhaging money.
How could you possibly know that.
It wasn't a redirect. He acknowledged that Putin has engaged in extrajudicial killings, pointed out that the US has as well, and that the US is better off working with Russia than against and that his foreign policy goal of defeating ISIS is more important than condemning Putin. Why does the US need a war with Russia all of a sudden?

I'm perfectly comfortable replacing a barrel. My concern is getting constant stuck casings taking me off the firing line. Two solutions I've heard are to mix a round or two of brass in a magazine with steel or drop some oil in the barrel extension every few hundred rounds.

Because the status quo isn't working and hasn't been. It's been benefiting a few while the rest get shafted.

I'm completely blown away he called it magic. I cannot believe this conversation just happened.
Then why is the "fake news" moniker and the censorship of it used so selectively? 
You act as though it's somehow shocking that someone who knows exactly how the status quo is benefiting the few by being one of those few knows how to topple it as well.\n\n> The thing people forget about breaking the status quo is that it can get worse too.\n\nFor some people it can't get much worse. For the rest of us we know exactly how the status quo was working for us: corrupt politicians, laws written by corporations to our detriment, wars overseas lasting for decades, jobs leaving in droves for the third world, the third world arriving in droves to take what the rest of us are squabbling over, and the rich few becoming richer while the rest of us steadily get poorer and eat each other alive.

Everything you say is true but it doesn't affect the fact that the ACA wasn't gutted to appease Republicans. It was Democrats who demanded changes to the bill and there weren't enough Republicans to block the bill's passage.

A premium is the amount you pay each month for health insurance. I don't know that there's a "perfect" premium amount but after the Affordable Care Act premiums and related health insurance costs went up for a lot of people.

SJWs dye their hair, get visible tattoos and strange piercings so that they can signal to the world how unique their ideas and beliefs are, how much different they are from the rest of the world that perpetuates the systems they hate. The phrase "special snowflake" is more accurate than you'd think because most of these types really do see themselves as the resistance against an oppressive mainstream.
I think the real issue is that Trump supporters *want* Trump to disrupt the status quo. That was the point in electing him.

Some are suggesting you ask for 20 to get 17. From the sounds of it, I'd ask for more than 20 to get 20.

It's really interesting to me how Trump says something that is said on Reddit every other day and the reaction is to criticize Trump and his supporters for the implications.

I always thought it was the availability of the 33 round magazines that made the Glock 9mm version so popular.
> Advocating for genocide of certain groups is the litmus test here.\n\nSays *you*. The definition of "Nazism" has stretched quite a bit, leading to riots against a gay Jew at UC Berkeley and the associated beatings and assaults on innocent bystanders, as well as [threats made against children](http://imgur.com/a/Ok3E5). This is the danger of approving of violence.\n\nAnd for the record the guy punched in this story wasn't advocating genocide. He was passing out political fliers and the cops said he had the right to.
Eh? I just looked at GW's website and the only Prosecutors I see are $149. Z charges less than $20 for five Grey Knights Terminators when GW charges EIGHTY SEVEN FUCKING DOLLARS???? I haven't bought GW in so long I remember when they were $50!
Nor is that pedophilia, technically.
Hey man whatever works.
People are fucking weird.
You realize this is a mechanism that will be used to suppress information as fake news to manipulate the election against Le Pen? 
In Britain it is illegal to do that and I think that's a ridiculous law. Interesting that you bring up ISIS and Muslims. Islam has a cozy history with Nazism, and modern Neo Nazism and Islam - especially in the Middle East - have antisemitism in common. The Quran preaches some very hateful passages about women, nonbelievers, and enemy of Allah. If I punched a street Imam preaching about the Quran would you be on my side under the justification that Islam leads to groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS, or attacks like those in San Bernardino or Orlando? Or would you tell me that it's wrong to punch someone because I disagree with their beliefs?
Well all my local ranges have the same rule and they don't care if you collect your brass or anyone else's. I suppose it's a plus if the range staff want to collect your brass that they don't have to sort through steel. My understanding is that bimetal jackets can create sparks that risk igniting unburnt powder in the backstop and risk ricocheting off steel targets.
As long as it's something you support. The instant the "fake news" is something you are for or agree with you'll change your tune and it is very trusting of you to assume that organizations protecting you from fake news will always be so objective.
An online petition.  Really?  They're so easy to scam it's ridiculous.
That's not actually a great example. In their testing conditions - thousands of rounds in a short period of time - the wear was dramatically increased. Spread that same amount out over the course of a year, which is still more than most shooters would shoot, and you get far less pronounced wear and massive cost savings. 
Why in God's name does the tag office still take forever with the most bitter, unhelpful people running the place?
I don't like be surprised if the NSA didn't have it as well.  
So, in other words, no, we don't have them in the US arsenal.  These links are either bombs/warheads being researched or talk.  Not artillery shells/tank shells.
As far as I know, if you have a prescription, you are ok.  But if you have a prescription, get it from Costco, not from an online pharmacy.\n\nRe. Sleep doctor, what would be your point in mentioning Modafinil?  
It depends on you and whether or not you actually saw a problem with tolerance...
Yeah, now imagine you're a doctor that's not and still asking that question.
I was thinking it was more the sword was used to disrupt the defenses while the magic took the mage out.
I have not noticed anything like that.
It'd be funny if they started the trailer off with Valkyr Prime, and then have Banshee Prime boot her off pretty much immediately.
Nope.  It doesn't even get an honorable mention.  Look up the Champawat Tiger.  This kitty cat's got a long ways to go to get close to that.
I think that any online petition is a popularity contest easily affected by whatever organization(s) that want it to have the results say what they want it to say.  This renders the results questionable at best.  Just ask Boaty McBoatface.
I was thinking more of an institutionalized training environment (academies, etc).  It seems like a lot more peaceful era, so a lot of the individual villages, masters, etc. might have died off through age.   Or been murtalized by the people hiding the knowledge.
I'm half expecting him to dominate the guy and get a famine knight serving under him.
Good plan.  As long as there's other doctors in the area accepting your insurance...
Pew pew pew!
For flmodafinil, you're going to want to test out the smaller doses and you need a mg scale for it.  You can't really do the spoons first in that situation.
The program was ended without warning so you didn't have a massive load of people trying to get in to get benefits at one time.
They sure like coming out of the woodwork don't they?
Yeah, agreed.  But they deserve everything they get...
I would say potentially, but it depends on your situation.  \n\nIn terms of sports, a lot of organizations have banned Modafinil as a performance enhancing drug.  This is because of the fatigue reduction, not focus enhancement. \n\nModafinil's a wakefulness promoting drug.  It helps reduce fatigue.  It helps you do more with your time.  It doesn't help you focus per se.  Adderall/Ritalin for ADHD would be more likely to do that, and I believe the large e-sports organizations are already testing for it.\n\nSo, if you're having a problem getting into the zone because of fatigue, Modafinil will help.  If you're having a problem getting into the zone because you can't focus (outside of fatigue), Modafinil won't help.\n\n
TL:DR Mongolians bringing food/woo woo medicine from home.
Probably depends on where you are.  Where I am, it's been fairly solid last couple years, picking up recently.  I was at a local field recently and there were really too many walk ons there.  Gets a bit tough when all the close cover's got 4-5 people trying to get behind it on the break.
Getting gun advice from a non-gun owning doctor is kind of like getting marital sex advice from a virgin priest.
No idea who's suggesting it, but it's fairly situational now with all the nullifiers.   If you have nullifiers, larger globes are harder to protect and easy for them to destroy.  If you have no nullifiers, having the chilling globe mod will have a good chance at freezing/slowing things entering the globe.  Larger globe works out better with that.
I don't understand how they have any disciples remaining considering how much they're screwing over their own people for her.
Isn't that kind of what he did with the step mother and assassin step/gramps?  Cleaned them up behind the scenes after thighs were said and done?
Asides from not being treated.  If I go in to the doctor for the flu, and they start asking about my guns, I'm going to be wondering how skilled they are since they're asking about something totally unrelated.
That's what I was thinking, lol.
I was expecting him to want to spar with the teacher lady.
Shopping would suck.
Yeah, it's like Oprah of MC's out there.  You're an MC, you're an MC, you're all MC's!
If you have a prescription, get it from Costco.  Try it out to see how it works for you from a dependable source, *then* try Indian pharmacy roulette.  
I assume you're talking speedball.  Unless you're on the high end, I think the weak point would be your accuracy and not the marker.
I find for my purposes, I get the best results if I list out the tasks I want to complete during the day.
Only stupid from our perspective on the story.  It didn't look like there was really any warning signs that the lady was going to try and poison his mother.   So he may not have noticed anything while he was being lazy.
I'm waiting for the "Today, I am an Atheist too" rally.
Even if they work together well, getting 4 people with varying ping times to do something simultaneously isn't fun.
The crab steps were low end though.  It's only good because he put so much time into improving it.
As far as I know, there's no nuclear artillery or tank rounds currently in the arsenal.  Those were all phased out decades ago.  Are you aware of anything different?  I believe they're all bombs or warheads.
Agreed, it's not worth the effort to farm the Javlok capacitors for.
Yet her decision was reversed 2 to 1.  No idea what their reason was though.  However, it's a bit disingenuous to say it was anectdotal so could be overturned.  Plenty of anti-gun laws banning items that were never used in a shooting were passed for example. 
I don't think she deserves it.  Clearly she was using him for her own gains, as shown by her dropping him like a hot rock when the latest and greatest popped up.
I voted for Cthulu in the last election.
Not sure why he mentioned that to the old man.  He's depending on the old man's acting skills there to not get caught by the prince and the butler.
You realize that had nothing to do with a militia right?  That was a navy created by Congress through it's power to create a navy.
Musket to full auto rifles is not an abstract.  Show me infantrymen flying planes, dropping cluster bombs, and driving tanks.  Otherwise it's a poor attempt at trying to find an excuse to ban guns.\n\nAnd no, the militia did not have a navy when the constitution was written.  That came quite a bit later. 
I pretty much only use the vaykor.  Re larger magazine size is a big QOL thing.  It can be annoying having to reload all the time.
Chuck?  You're on reddit?
Or a Prince.
You can use it in a pinch, but it's fairly inaccurate for nootropics.  You really want a MG scale.  Especially if you're trying to evaluate what doses work best for you.
So the real reason comes out?  Now you know why the NRA and others are against figures of authority (doctors) asking about people's guns.
In the first event, the % went down extremely fast while everyone was aborting left and right after they didn't get the mod drop they wanted.  Sure, it could have been timed that way, but it didn't feel like it at the time. 
They were competing with "free" on the internet.  Take away nudity and you can get a wider audience for the articles.  
I'm pretty sure that's all been decommissioned decades ago and replaced with missiles and bombs.  Just clarifying the artillery/tanks part.
That's my guess.
I suspect they don't want masses of people coming across their borders though.  It didn't really work out too well the last time for them.
> So either your another idiot who can't read \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLOL
Considering some of the people that have had state visits with the Queen, I think Trump's on the low end of disagreeable people.  
It wasn't speedball (I don't care for it myself).  It was more recball.  Large spools, town, junkyard.  If you're fast, you can run for the more distant cover, but if you're slower, you're going to get hosed down with that many people on a side shooting.   
I think it's a given in these early rounds.  As you say, there's more to gain than lose.  But at some point, you're only going to have trolls.
200mg in "morning", whenever that i Le for shift/narcoleptics.   200mg at start, and 200mg in 8 hours as needed for Airforce pilots on mission.  Max is 400mg.   The larger the dose, the more likely negative side effects.  Those doses are not always necessary for study/nootropic use.  You'll want to test out in 50mg increments to see the minimum that works for your purposes.
Thus the "try".    But it's been fairly successful overall I think.
That would assume he could model her without getting detected.  She might get a bit cranky otherwise.
Then people wonder why customers stop showing up
The only way I can think of for the knowledge to be lost like that is if they have supporters at the very top of the organizations.

I think a week's fine, but it's better to have longer periods off with normal sleep.  In my opinion, it's not really tolerance, it's the lack of sleep that causes you problems.
He's definitely got a lot of baggage.  However, it seems to be a might makes right world.  If the guy suddenly turns "sane" and does some sort of blood oath to the prince, it probably would be accepted.  \n\nJust conquering Famine, I don't know.  So far at least, they don't seem to have direct representation in the world.  It's through their knight proxies.
I think that it was well known that the Cuban Adjustment Act was on it's last legs once Obama normalized relations with Cuba.  It's not like they turned around and "Oh, the program's over, I'm screwed".  Note, their only options are not the US or the US.  They've got other countries to go to, it's just not the sweet sweet deal that the US gave for decades.
What do you play?  Cyclones are a bit lacking for speedball.   For recball, when I got into paintball with friends, there were multiple times I was on the field with my A5 with the cyclone, while they were farting around on the sidelines trying to get their hopper working.   But not sure in re. add on cyclones.  I assume it's as dependable.
I often get the feeling these authors have never interacted with females before.
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about in re. the militia and the Constitution.  You might want to research more on what exactly the militia was vs the army and navy.  Hint, they're not the same.\n\nRe. The second amendment, the misc interpretations are due to the environment it was written in.  The British government was screwing over British citizens in the Colonies and then disarmed (or tried to) the militias and population when they objected.  A lot of the original Bill of Rights was written to try and prevent the new US government from doing what the British government did.  \n\nRe. "International joke".  The US constitution was not written to be a popularity contest. Doing something just so that some nebulous other country likes us more is the height of insanity.  On both sides of the aisle.  There's plenty of things other countries think are grand that would never fly here. 
Eugenics Japanese style.
You'd have to test it out to tell how you'll react to it.  Could be it'll be fine, could be you'll feel like death warmed over.
Or Kuva since that's also a grinder thing.
That's what they want you to think.  If it were known they had arrived, they'd be swarmed under.
So, in other words, it's part of Old Zealand?
A C class reward though, probably not worth much.
Interesting, I thought as long as you had the prescription, you were ok.
Check your college for paintball clubs.  If so, they may have local recommendations (and you may want to get gear consistent with theirs if you join them).
Yet that shining example of the Democratic party still failed against him...
Not to mention tops in other countries where guns are fairly restricted, like Japan or Australia.
wow. that's an awesome way to put it.
Cuban refugees got special attention and a ton of sweet benefits from the US over the years because we couldn't kill off Castro.  Now that relations are normalized, those programs were ended.
If insurance covers, it usually is only for a diagnosis of narcolepsy, shift work, or sleep apnea.
I would talk with the doctor first about your current drug putting you to sleep.  They'll probably want to change it.
I was thinking of this in re. the lion.  http://i.imgur.com/YNOZ0pg.gif
That was the original source for this law in question.  It's a sensitive topic and a lot of pro-gun people don't blanket trust what the doctors are saying about it based on previous actions and information that you don't see in this article.  There's a lot of history that you don't know if you're just seeing this article alone.\n
From the article:\n"The Republican-controlled state Legislature adopted the Firearm Owners’ Privacy Act in 2011 after an Ocala couple complained that a doctor asked them about guns and they refused to answer. The physician refused to see them anymore."\n\nSo sounds like some people had issues getting seen.
It's be funny if it ended up larger than the MC's.
Does it work?  I usually find 2 types.  Ignorant people that don't know all the benefits the Cuban refugees got before and people that feel entitled to the US's largesse, just because.  Not much in the middle.
Unless you work at it,  odds are none of the earth shattering problems/bullies/etc. critical to you at 16 will exist in your world as such at 32.
Pigs are not horse/cattle.
Have you tried playing around with dose size to see if that changed anything for you?  Or.  Instead of 200mg, try 150mg.  Assuming you're in a situation you can be a little "off" if the lower dose doesn't work out?
Asides from that, there's not much reason for them to go back to be executed.  Presumably their families will be murdered either way, so I imagine they'll swear to follow the MC if he can save their families.
No.  What do you do when they change the app icon?
It doesn't say on the package?  1 scoop then.

Please people mass report this to bioware. They have made some of the best games i have played and i dont want someone with so much hatred ruining games for everyone else. 
Is it being "that guy" or spreading knowledge when I say\n\nMand'alor is the spelling used to refer to the leader while Mandalor is the planet. 
Its also super weak to swordsman, so yay having level 10 of those
Also 1 star vote the show. 
The sith Warrior/Inquistor's ship, Fury, from SWTOR is probably my second favorite ship in canon/eu. It's so sleek and just oozes "I'm going to murder you."
Of course GI isn't. He's far better due to that passive that, when played correctly, gives him a great edge with an almost guaranteed push. Stun plus GI's active almost always spell death and can be used to chunk(or destroy) a tower or eliminate the enemy leader for a guaranteed tower kill. \n\nWhile suiciding seems like Luke's best tactic it is merely one of the many tools the GI player can choose to employ.  
Some asshole went to literally all his videos and took snippets from them that they deemed racist/bigoted and made a montage of them claiming the dude to be racist or some shit. Taken out of context they seem far more worse than they truly are, even though I would consider everything he said quite mundane. \n\nIt's like looking at the footage of a person who's been in front of a camera for literally over a thousand hours and taking audio snippets from various videos and splicing them together to make them say outlandish things that they've never actually said in a single sentence. 
Female troll's orc ride*\n\nUnless female orcs are now blue and trolls are that deep of green. 
I haven't yet touched any of the new books where inquisitors may be mentioned, and only know of what Rebels presents them as, but are inquisitors just a fancier version of sith assassins that other Sith Lords deploy as advanced fodder?  Because they just seem like the run of the mill sith assassins of yesteryear, barely(if at all) force sensitive, and sometimes decked out in cybernetics. 
Eh, just make sure his ass gets kicked out.

Right? I went up to canada 2 years ago to go camping with buddies. The canadian border agent took maybe 15mins to let us pass. The Anerican agent on the return took about 30mins with many more questions compared to entry into canada. Was i angry? Fuck no. Every single question was warranted( why were you in canada, whats your occupation in america, what state do you live in) perfectly fine with me as an american answering any question you want to get back into my country.

While I agree with what you said I'm downvoting you for censoring the word "ass" on the internet like some 12 year old who doesn't want to get caught by mommy. Also for "urself" and "bra" as you make yourself look like the ignorant asshole. 
I mean about a year back there was an officially Disney licensed picture titled "Rey Skywalker" by a Spanish artist that got pulled less than a week from its unveiling. Pretty sure Rey is a Skywalker.    
Pc version is better due to a mod that restores a lot of cut content and fixes bugs. \n\nConsole commands for faster movement are a god send as the amount of walking with nothing of value going on is crazy high. \n\nIf you can play it on pc do so but dont let that stop you from experiencing that which is Revan. 
While I understand unions and their existence to maintain fair labor practices and such I really fucking hate the teacher's union and wish it would get dismantled. I forgot which documentary it was but it showed how New York teachers after being disciplined for some wrong doing and awaiting a board evaluation basically sit in a room during normal school hours doing nothing but still collecting pay. \n\nYeah no that shit needs to go. And it stems from schools not having the ability to properly dismiss the teachers that cause these problems. \n\nIf there's a  rule every working American citizen should live by it would be expect to actually work when you go to work and after so many instances of you blatantly not doing your job than your ass is gone and the position given to the next citizen who will happily do their job. 
Wow im going to get about 30k back due to leader upgrade cost changes. Overall I'm very happy with these changes. Sucks that legendary for legendary is now 24hr cool down.

Cad Bane is a terrible bounty hunter and I hope he never is shown again. \n\nNew Mando's are terrible and whoever decided to take them in this direction should never be allowed to write star wars anything ever again. \n\nNew crystal mythology is taking the focus on the crystal too far and not on all the parts that make up the lightsaber. \n\n"Ren" is a terrible title when compared to Darth/Lord\n\nRey is a Skywalker and theories saying otherwise are a waste of time\n\nNo, some very specific clone troopers did not "remove the control chip that forced them to fulfill order 66" 
God bless our Emperor. 
Did they ever explain the spinning sabers? I thought they were kind of dumb when I first saw Rebels. Then I grew okay with them. Then I saw them do that helicopter thing in the later seasons of Rebels and was appalled by how fucking stupid it was. \n\nAlso the way they rewrote crystals in the Ahsoka novel seems really stupid and convoluted. The whole "pilgrimage to a kyber crystal planet" version was better. None of this crystal bleeding and imprinting nonsense.   
Also an under leveled rebel deck for t6 compared to my empire deck and average enemy's deck levels. I'm not going to drop like 9k to update my 3 bread and butter rebel cards when my next empire basic card upgrade cost is 3.6k

So what's the word on the travel ban? Is that Seattle judge's bullshit still in place or what's the deal? 
Best pope in the last 100 years, quite true. 
I'll give you $200 for it.
So, light tank vs atst in a deck that has eighth brother in it in both 1v1 and 2v2? I find myself liking light tank in 1s and atst in 2s as the added eighth brother provides some extra tankyness you lose when forgoing the atst.  
Dengar's passive needs a rework and Slave I/U Wing needs a rework. No reason those 2 uniques should be one and done while literally the rest of the uniques remain on the field until killed. I think mortar turret should be limited to attacking units only and not towers. 
If you are a women in the US who supports Sharia law you are literally asking to be forcefully raped and then stoned to death because you were raped. 
Having a cool name under your name basically. 
Good.
Thanks for the video!
Can confirm Ben shouldnt be able to do that. Had an enemy luke spawn a ben on top of my atst and he was able to do mind trick without being stunned. Ben turned the storm troopers around the atst but not the atst itself. \n\n\nI think it's a very rare bug. 
They also eliminated crystals being a different color due to it being a different crystal type. Now they're basically blank and just read the wielder the first time and then the color is generated based on their state of mind...basically force mood rings. And the bleeding that allowed Ahoska to purify the red saber to make it white seems un needed. \n\nSynthetic crystals were fine as they were. The pilgrimage showed the Jedi's reverence for the learning process of building a saber and being a Jedi. \n\n\nI'm slightly annoyed at this new canon but I'll get over it. I'm fine with new things being added where they fit, but I'm not okay with rewriting things that were established and perfectly fine. It's like when The Clone Wars rewrote the Mandalorians with their whole queen and peace bullshit and basically ruined half their lore. Thank Sidious that Rebels mentioning of the Jedi and Mandalorian War slightly rectified that transgression. It also paves the way for Revan being brought into official canon...now they just need to not fuck up hard with Revan's story. I believe a lot of people got angry but eventually accepted EU no longer being "official", but many nerds will be up in arms if writers take Revan and twist him into something that his written story says he wasn't. The sad part is if this occurs the writers probably won't understand why fans became angry with them and then take offense that people got angry with their writing and play the victim card. 
Never mind the morg's rank 3 w clearing casters or viktor's laser just wrecking the entire wave. Nope gotta ruin the waveclear of the champ that actually needs 2 abilities to do it. 
"Normies" should just stay the fuck off 4chan and go back to drinking their lattes and thinking they they are making any sort of difference. 
Are you saying he doesn't have Christian values or because he's a Catholic that doesn't make him Christian? If the second one, that is technically incorrect as all Catholics are Christians but not all Christians are Catholic. Just as the Pope technically speaks on the behalf of Catholicism and not on the behalf of Christianity as a whole(as one of the reason Protestant groups formed was not wanting to be subject to the Pope).  
Despite human nature saying there's only two genders*\n\nGotta be extra clear on that as people love to pick it apart with useless comments about how there are    hermaphroditic animals in nature. While that is true it doesn't mean shit when we are talking exclusively about modern humans. 
Perhaps say fuck the stamina bar and just have it default to sprint and then rebalance movespeeds accordingly? 
Im naming my next bitch Rey. I'd totally get a black and white kitten and name her Jyn.

Even if that isnt the case, thats an ugly as fuck picture. 
Say it with me 'Pedes\n\n**C U N T**
The thing about gi is that he has the luke playstyle if need be, and also a defensive playstyle that makes far better use of his passive. If the gi figures out he can run train on your ass because you fucked up than he will play like suicide luke. 
Some fair bits of what make Mandalorians *Madalorians* was established in the Republic Commando book series. All of which this new portrayal that started in TCW has yet to hold a true candle to. 
 >This may help those of you trying to grind to level 100. If you are familiar with the Battle Buffet on Melemele Island, you'll know that it gives you 10 moves to defeat 10 oppponents. Each Mon you face will be level 65 but you can bring any level you would like. I personally bring any Mon level 90+ and OHKO as many Mons as possible. You gain around 1500+ exp. per battle. The only downside to this is the animation time and the fact you can only visit the battle cafe once per day until now! If you leave the Battle Buffet before all 10 moves are up you can immediately return to the Battle Buffet to battle again. Creating an endless chain of battles. I got my whole team up to level 50 in a little less than an hour. Hopefully this helps those of you who took the time to read this. \n
that's not "just what boys do". WTF
Well, you shouldn't. That was one of the reasons why Catholicism had splinter groups break off and form their own sects of Christianity. Catholics are the main group the Pope speaks for(technically speaking or so), but that doesn't mean I as a Catholic have to gave a shit either. 
I watched the whole thing, as I found it to be quite compelling. It really seems like if you dislike Sessions it's simply due to you out right refusing to give anything trump does a chance. 
Oh boy, I cannot wait until the Liberals and Control-Left find a way to spin this as some kind of bigotry...
Well this is absolutely fucked. How many times do we have to see this to say fuck it the minority ruined it for the majority?  
Google "kiss cartoon rick and morty"
The way I look at it is that it's suicide luke but with more depth. Sometimes you wait to punish your enemy and then get the 7 seconds of increased troop movement and attack speed for some really quick pushes and chip damage. But at the same time if you manage to get an energy advantage on your enemy GI is quite capable of just running in to tank turret shots while your units catch up/attack for free. Sure, you won't last as long as luke but the option is there for you. Combined with a pretty tanky 3 energy unique that throws a saber and then proceeds to melee attack it can be quite punishing. Stun grenade + GI's active provides just as much aoe burst, but on a slightly smaller radius. \n\nHe really shines in 2v2 though were he has the ability to proc a passive at a higher rate to really get a quick push in. I love when I'm paired with Bossk because I know pushes can be deadly as hell with my granted troop move and attack speed and his generated 2 energy on leader kill. Very easy to get 2/3 atst's out and in position all at once. 
Sooo are new canon Mandos eastern theme'd now? Or are they giving each clan their own vibe? \n\nI can get behind each clan having their own theme but if the entirety of Mandalorian culture in canon is now just space Japanese I'll be slightly disappointed. \n\nI much prefer the idea that Mandalorian culture accepted any and all into their ranks and their warrior traditions were more dark age/viking honor, while being about training and basic constant raiding/fighting everyone that wasn't in their specific clan unless rallied under the rare time a Mand'alor was chosen. \n\nBut then again I'm pretty sure the majority of the fanbase that bothers to remain up to date on what is and isn't canon still prefer the old mandalorians.   
Daisy Ridley looks fucking hot in that children's toy box art. \n\n...guys?

I would suggest upping GI since you said you have 8th Brother. I say this as someone who also loves Boba but I have found him underwhelming in his current state and believe Slave I needs to be redesigned to be on par with other uniques. I climbed to tier 5 two star before switching to GI and found much better success in both 1v1's and 2v2's. GI's unique is also pretty tanky so it pairs well with either light tank or atst. I ultimately feel like he's more rewarding than Boba due to having a proper special passive that really punishes enemies for dying by your hand. \n\nI know Vader is used a lot in Kyber and I love his passive but I'm not big on him having that dash over no sprint. That's just my preference of movement though. Ultimately I believe Vader rewards a good player better and more consistently than GI, but GI is very close to Vader due to his playstyle being slightly more forgiving when you fuck up compared to Vader.  
Well if it means anything to you, here's a thank you from an internet stranger.

Uh, dude? Catholicism is the original Christianity.  All Catholics are Christians but not all Christians are Catholic, technically speaking. But having stated that, yes I find myself disagreeing with most things this pope is saying.

As someone from IL it pisses me the fuck off that my state goes blue because of Chicago and only Chicago. Without Cook county IL is a red state. \n\nIt further pisses me off that my vote means nothing in my state when it cones to presidential elections, but I can't help but feel that it's my civic duty to vote so not voting isn't an option. Just mild frustration. \n\nBut at least I'm not rioting and causing millions in damages. 
Yeah target each fuck who left work and fire their asses. You want to protest that's cool, but don't expect to keep your job. 
Did you at least get to put your dick in her ass? 
It is. After I reread my last post the thought I was trying to convey didn't come out the exact way I had wanted it to. \n\nCrystals "calling out" and "resonating" worked fine. Different colors calling out to particular individuals and resonating with them worked as a great simplistic mysticism.\n\nThis new resonating upon imprinting(I'm just going to call it that) and having the color generate based on the wielder's inner vindication's(yellow to seek out the sith, etc etc) at the time, *coupled* with this crystal bleeding to just up and change a crystal's(in this case from red to white)  color seems like overly complex mysticism for the sake of complex mysticism. \n\nIt's like if after Anakin went all murder-hobo on the younglings his blue lightsaber bled and suddenly became red through his wrong doings. \n\nJust no. You want a different lightsaber for your character then have them go out and create their new saber with a different crystal. \n\nI guess when it comes down to lightsaber lore I'm more of a fan of the whole process of building the saber as all the parts matter equally in order to create the finished product(hilt styling, crystal, focusing lens, the user himself) compared to what seems like just a focus on a user's emotions and a crystal that seems to be a glorified mood ring. \n\nDid this make sense at all? I'm on mobile atm and it makes it feel harder for me to convey detailed points. 
As a catholic I wish the pope would stay the fuck away from the subject of a country's national security...but than again I really dont give a shit about what the pope has to to say which is hilarious as I'm part of the only Christian group that has traditionally always given a shit about what the pope has to say. 
Did anyone screen cap the highest viewed number of downvotes, or have a way to view the max before it was deleted? 
Yup quite right. If your goal is to come here illegally and live, I want you the fuck out and I do not care in the slightest what happens to you in your country of origin.\n\nBut if you come here following the legal process(that needs to be reformed, but that's a separate issue) than I welcome you with open arms as you declare the American flag as your flag and begin to meld into our culture.

Wow, Oblivion's Dark Brotherhood storyline is probably my absolute favorite Elder Scrolls story I've experienced so far...I wonder what has caused him to fall from writing such great stories.
Yup and now the most widely known form of Christianity is Catholicism and also boasts the highest numbers of all Christian religious groups. Again, all Catholics are Christians. 
Not wrong as all. Christian just means followers of Christ. Thus all Catholics are Christians. And that last bit is laughable as the Jews have never accepted Jesus as their savior.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity \n\nPlease educate yourself in the slightest bit of Christianity as a whole. I'm going to assume you didn't have to live your entire educational life in religious Christian institutions otherwise you would of been subjected to all the bullshit religion classes and mandatory theology classes that bothers to teach the differences between all this crap.
It made me stop playing Boba until it gets reworked to be in line with the other uniques. Not a fan of it being a non unit. 
It's a dumb wait but I haven't been too turned off by it. I play at working during 3rd shift so when I queue up I just continue reading the book I'm reading and eventually 2 or 3 pages later I'm in game. Repeat until I have to make my rounds.

Dont get me wrong, I fucking hate pewdiepie. I find him annoying as shit, his videos cancerous clickbait, and his audience are retarded fucks...all this coming from a 22 year old dude who's as versed as a person of his generation usually is with youtube celebrities, buuuut this guy isnt a damned racist. He seems to come off as a kind and honest person who only wishes to entertain and make people laugh. He doesnt deserve to get ripped apart by some fuck that's looking for easy click. Hell, I bet you my left hand that Pewdiepie has raised more money for charities than ANY of the people currently speaking ill of the man. You know this dude isn't on the right either, he's either liberal or left leaning center so it's just a another case of the left eating themselves alive.    
That's why the last 2,000 years have been so peaceful! 
Punch me in the street and I'll draw on you faster than you can realize that you're going to literally die in the next 5 seconds. I don't understand the left's obsession with promoting violence against the team that has consistently shown that they like, use, and carry guns to the fullest extent of the law. \n\nAnd to those who think I'm promoting violence, what I'm actually promoting is self defense. 
So far Dark Disciple has been my favorite of this selection. Lords of the Sith has some great Vader moments but I fucking hate the author's writing stylings. 
Seems like you didnt play dragon age inquisition then\n\nOr any bioware title in the las 5 years really. 
That was the previous patch and it was because the rebel tank outclassed the living fuck out of empire's tank. 
I mean if your culture believes in honor violence, little lone honor *killings* your culture will not mesh with western values.  Plain and simple. Americans have an idea of "honor" but that idea is dramatically different when compared to old Japan and modern middle east. Our idea of honor makes up act in a way that takes the high rode. Middle eastern honor means killing those who insult you. Which is a big fucking red flag that liberals seem to ignore. 
I linked wikipedia because it's easier than trying to explain it to someone that clearly isn't Catholic. Further you cannot claim Catholics aren't followers of Christ when Jesus is literally claimed to be followed. At the end of the day no matter what you argue the Roman Catholic Church, the original group of monotheistic Christianity with Peter as the first human pope appointed by Jesus is still the biggest group of Christens in existence today. 
I know this has nothing to do with anything, but hockey is kickass and is easily my favorite sport. 
> And leave this behind in her apartment before I leave just in case she doesn't feel like talking in person yet.\n\nI have one concern with doing it this way.  What if someone stops by before she opens the gift, and she winds up unwrapping it in front of someone who she's not out to?

> She's not controlling him though. She gave him a choice. Everyone is allowed to have all kinds of dealbreakers, isn't that the mantra of this sub?\n\nDealbreakers are allowed, but using the threat of breaking up to manipulate your partner is emotionally abusive.  Navigating this inherent contradiction requires looking at and understanding the larger circumstances.\n\n> Jumping to her being an abuser from one single experience is a bit rich, don't you think?\n\nShe went from seemingly 100% A-OK with things to the nuclear option.  That's pretty messed up, even if it's only happened once.  To clarify, she went from happily living with the OP to leaving and staying with a friend without any sort of precipitating action on the OP's part or prior discussion.  That's nowhere close to normal "enforcing a dealbreaker" behavior.\n\nAs for taking a single instance seriously, think about the consequences if she had pulled this after the wedding.  Divorce ain't cheap, and it would be rather foolish for the OP to marrying someone who can pull relationship-ending ultimatums out of the blue.

If I asked you to write the conditionals to check whether a single value is less than 10 or greater than 10, you could do that, right?  So just do that 6 times, once for each input.\n\nIf you know how to write a function that can return more than one value, you could do that -- pass in the number that was input, and the current `multiply` and `sum` variables, and have it pass back the updated `multiply` and `sum`.  If you don't know how to do that, then you can just go the manual route of writing the code out 6 times for each input variable.\n\nAlso, since you don't need to keep around the input variables once you've processed them, there's really no need to use 6 different variables.  I'd just go with a single input variable that you reuse -- that would make it easier to copy and paste the conditionals if you don't go the function route.
> I'm studying to be a journalist and for the past couple of years have worked as a freelance writer.

When your extended schooling comes up, just mention the industry experience you've been getting.  Point out that working on actual writing and journalism jobs had shifted some of your concentration away from school, but you'll be much better off when you graduate.\n\nSure, it's glossing over the other issues, but no one would begrudge you for not airing your dirty laundry.  And bringing up the freelance writing gives you more to discuss.

Additionally, there's [this page](http://rudix.org/packages/frotz.html) as the second Google result for "frotz os x".  It seems to have precompiled versions of Frotz for various OS X versions, including El Capitan.\n\n[This page](http://inform7.com/if/interpreters/) also has some other options for OS X that may have a nicer UI and might provide a better experience.
Do you have adblock software installed?  Sometimes, they include fairly generic rules that would catch image names like that.
Glad I could help.  And yeah, running out of time definitely explains it.\n\nIn the future, I would recommend getting the printing function working first so you can test things as you go along.  When I was testing your code, I was calling the (corrected) printing function every step of the way, and errors would quickly become obvious.\n\nOf course that still doesn't help in terms of running out of time, but it's hopefully helpful with other projects.
> domain names cannot be shorter than 2 characters.\n\nThat's not quite correct.  IANA has reserved most of the one-letter domain names in the gTLDs (.com, .net, .org, etc.), but there's nothing stopping a ccTLD from issuing a one-letter domain name.  In fact, Google owns g.cn.
Glad I could help.  I did fix one small error.  The variables in the `for` loop need to use %% instead of % when you're doing this in a .bat file.  I believe this is because the variables get expanded when the .bat file is run and again when each line is interpreted.
A simple minmax AI shouldn't be too hard for checkers.  The problem becomes a lot less intimidating when it's broken down into the 3 main parts of a minmax algorithm:\n\n1) A board evaluator.  For a given checker board, generate a score representing how good or bad it is for the AI.  The actual range of values you use are entirely up to you.  For example, you might consider a winning board to be +1000, a losing board to be -1000, and otherwise +1 for each of its pieces and +5 for each of its kings, and -1 for each opponent piece and -5 for each opponent king.  A more sophisticated board evaluator might score pieces based on how far they are from the other end of the board, but that sort of tweaking can wait until after things are working.\n\n2) A move generator.  For a given board and knowing whose turn it is, generate every new possible board that can occur if the current player makes a single move.\n\n3) The minmax routine itself.  Look X moves ahead, assuming at each step that the AI picks the move with the maximum score (best for the AI), and its opponent picks the move with the minimum score (worst for the AI).  The scores comes from running your board evaluator on each board that's X moves ahead.  If you're comfortable with recursion, this part will be the easiest and most generic part of your AI.  Otherwise, it may take a bit of work for things to click.\n\nIf this all makes the problem sound a lot less scary, then go for it.  Otherwise, if you want to still put it on the back burner for a while, it's ultimately up to you.
This is just my personal opinion, but I tend to believe in standing behind what I post.  If I'm not willing to do that, then I feel I shouldn't be wasting people's time by asking them to read it in the first place.\n\nThat being said, I'm also willing to admit when I'm wrong.  And I will occasionally delete a post if it's right away, and someone else posted a better version of the same thing while I was posting or I otherwise realize I completely misread what I was replying to.\n\nBut in general, I believe that if it's worth posting, it's worth leaving up.

You're grasping at straws.  If there's a surprise, then it would be a lot more reasonable for the wife to indicate that she has more planned rather than resorting to calling the OP selfish.  She doesn't even have to spoil the surprise, she just has to say that there is one.  Using insults and accusations to try and keep a good surprise completely secret is counter-productive and harmful to the relationship.
> I now cannot say that haven't won since the ottoman empire was a thing.\n\nYou can start looking forward.\n\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, it was still legal to manually drive a car.\n\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, Britain was part of the EU.\n\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, there were only 50 states in the U.S.\n\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, there was no follow-up interplanetary championship against Mars.\n\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, none of their athletes were genetically modified.\n\nThe last time the Cubs won the World Series, viewers had to literally watch it.  Even internet viewers still perceived it as mere light and sound.\n
Did you complete all three steps, but your board evaluator resulted in a bad AI, or were you so worried about making a perfect evaluator that you didn't get further?\n\nIf it's the former, yeah, that's tricky, and I don't have any easy advice.\n\nBut if it's the latter, then I would suggest finishing it without getting too hung up on step 1.  I understand why having a super-amazing board evaluator seems appealing -- it adds a lot to the AI without adding significant memory and computation costs.  But a lot of "intelligence" still comes from step 2.\n\nFor example, if you've got a very simple evaluator that just recognizes win/loss and relative number of pieces, it may implicitly recognize things like protecting a piece (by having another friendly piece behind it, preventing capture) because the unprotected alternative will yield lower scores due to the future loss of that piece.
I think you should use it for ALL your English homework.  Your assignment's to write an essay analyzing the themes in Beowulf?  You turn in a copy of this story.  You're supposed to come up with 10 new vocabulary words?  You still turn in another copy of this story.  Your teacher wants a signed permission slip for a field trip?  Surprise, it's a copy of the story.\n\nThen, for the very last homework assignment, you hand in a sheet of paper with the following:\n\nKNOCK KNOCK.  \nWHO'S THERE?  \nORANGE.  \nORANGE WHO?  \nORANGE YOU GLAD I DIDN'T HAND IN ANOTHER COPY OF THAT STORY?  \n\nYou may fail the class, but you'll become a legend in the process.
> Do you think hiding it in an obvious place would mean she finds it quickly enough? I'm worried about just handing them over because I'm not sure she's ready to have a face to face conversation about it yet\n\nIt's hard to say how quickly she'd find them.\n\nPersonally, I'd lean towards a slightly different approach.  Towards the end of your visit, you can say something along the lines of, "I not sure if you're ready to talk about things, but I'm here for you when you are.  In the mean time, here are some books that may help you feel less alone and unsure."  That gives her an idea of what's going on, but it's not necessarily a full-blown discussion unless she indicates that she does want to talk about it.
Assuming you're in one of the main English-speaking countries, you're thinking of a [Universal Product Code (UPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code).  The Wikipedia entry gives more detail, but the simple version is that manufacturer's register to get a manufacturer number (which makes up the first half of the barcode), and then the manufacturer assigns whatever number they want for the second half of the barcode.  (There's also a prefix and check digit, but if you're curious about those, you can dig into the article.)
> I understand that, myself I identified as poly from the age of 16 up until my relationship with this guy ended. He was monogamous before he met me, I introduced him to the idea (ha).\n\nI suspect that people would be viewing him a lot more favorably if you had included this in your OP.  He already made a huge change for you once.  Giving him 2 months to change his views again isn't that unreasonable.

> Some people buy into the idea that gun control is an "all or nothing" approach, and that any movement towards regulating guns, however small or reasonable, is a "slippery slope" heading towards stricter gun control.\n\nExcept that's exactly what has happened in the recent past.  The last major federal gun control law (AWB of '94) banned a bunch of guns based largely on cosmetic and safety features.  The ban lasted for a decade, after which it automatically expired when Congress failed to extend it due to it have no noticeable effect on crime.  Bill Clinton cited the AWB as a major reason for the Democrats losing a bunch of Congressional seats shortly after its passage.

But if you're just looking for older films, the answer to your question is that you just aren't looking hard enough.
> A woman posted here last year with a similar scenario and it turned out that her boyfriend and family were planning a surprise party for her.\n\nDid the boyfriend in that scenario go so far as to accuse her of being selfish?  I stand by my claim that such behavior is harmful to the relationship, regardless of whether or not there's a good surprise hiding in the wings.  There's a huge difference between keeping someone in the dark about a surprise vs. making them feel like shit so you can surprise them.  The latter is not cool.
> If it's repealed am i going to lose my health insurance?\n\nKeep in mind that a repeal is unlikely to be an all-or-nothing proposition, nor would a repeal take place right away.  There's a good chance that the provision allowing you to stay on your mom's insurance would be kept (as that seems to be popular even with Republicans), and even a worst case scenario should still give you plenty of warning if you have to figure out a different strategy.\n\nWhile I do recommend keeping an eye on things, I wouldn't suggest worrying or changing your plans unless you see something more definite.

Googling both the title and the writer/director brought up [this description](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.support.childfree/0TPHCWNFxQk) which matches what you wrote.
The equivalent commands are still `cd` and `for`, so you can open up a command prompt and do `help cd` and `help for` to get the syntax.\n\nFor the CD, you'll want to include the /D switch (which tells it to include changing drive letters), and you no longer need to escape the backslashes.  So your first line will be:\n\n    cd /D E:\\MouseFactory\\MouseDirectory\\\n\nFor the `for` loop, the batch syntax is a little obnoxious compared to bash.  It only supports single-character variable names.  It looks like this:\n\n    for %%f in (*) do tts-cli.py -f "%%f" -o "/Volumes/Untitled/Audios/%%f.mp3"\n\nPut both of those lines together in a text file with a .bat extension, and it should do what you want.  You'll obviously want to test it a bit (I'm not 100% that I got the quoting right), but this should be enough to get you on the right path.\n\nEdit: % -> %% in `for` loop
I don't know enough about your circumstances to know how things are for you, but I do have my own experiences with weight loss that may or may not help give you some perspective:\n\nFor me, it took a weight-related health scare to really spur me into making serious changes.  I'd had a few half-hearted and semi-successful attempts here and there, but there wasn't ever any major progress, and nothing really stuck.\n\nBut once I really got into it, I discovered that there were a lot of tricks and tips that made things easier.  It still required discipline, but it wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be.  For example, just cutting out sugary drinks and switching to vegetables as a side dish helped make a nice dent in the calories I was consuming.\n\nBut I'm not replying to dump a bunch of diet advice on you.  I just want you to understand that the option to lose weight is always there if you decide to go that route at some point.  Ultimately, whatever you do should be about maximizing your overall happiness.  If the negatives of your excess weight exceed the positives of the lifestyle that produces that weight, then it may be worth adjusting your goals.

I followed the [PBF link](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF) in that page, and it led to a bunch of useful information.  It looks like PBF is a binary format, but it's not regular generic compression, so it's not surprising that 7-Zip was unable to do anything.  There's non-PBF stuff that seems to just be compressed XML, which is why you found the 7-Zip references on that page.\n\nAnyway, it looks like [Osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) is their reference implementation for manipulating PBF files, and [it has versions for Windows, Linux, and OS X](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis#How_to_install).  A quick glance at the example usage implies that it should have no trouble reading a PBF file and writing a corresponding XML-based OSM file.
> can't believe I didn't find that.\n\nTo be fair, the only reason I managed to find it is because I saw it at some point after seeing Van Wilder and recalled that Ryan Reynolds was the star.  Otherwise, it has a fairly generic title, and it didn't get a regular theatrical release in the U.S. (but it did in Canada), so it's a little less known despite have a decent rating on IMDB.\n\nAnyway, glad I could help.
Since you want to find `tion` when it's followed by either a space or the end of the string, you can translate that directly to regexp: `tion(\\s|$)`
If you're willing to tweak your design a bit, you can use a web server without having to add any backend code.  Instead of a hash, you can use the Last-Modified or ETag headers in the HTTP request to see if the file's changed.  However, since you aren't hashing the file contents, you'd need to come up with another way to store that information client-side (either a database of ETags or ensuring that the client-side file date is set to the Last-Modified date when you download the file).

Florida has closed primaries.  Could it be argued that it was a de facto firing of all employees that participated in the Republican primary election?  Alternately, could this action be taken as a threat against existing and future employees that they'll be fired if they attempt to participate in a future Republican primary election?
Could it be "[Exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_%28U.S._TV_series%29)" from the Sci-Fi channel?  I don't know about the desk plant story, but I do recall a short that was fairly similar to your description of the well story.\n\nThe short is called "[The Hole](http://absolutelypointless.net/feature/short/hole.html)".
> the backticks were what worked.\n\n[This page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/keywords.html) explains why.  `key` is a reserved keyword in MySQL, so it has to be quoted when used as an identifier.\n\nEdit: I had erroneously listed `value` as reserved keyword.  While it is a keyword, the linked page seems to indicate it's not a *reserved* keyword and thus doesn't need backticks.
The only free option I know of off-hand is that various cell providers offer email-to-SMS gateways.  But in order to use that, you'd need to know what provider a given phone number is registered to.  The resulting text message is also a bit on the ugly side.
> I think it was Twins but I can't be sure\n\nIt was definitely Twins.  Danny Devito's character was trying to disable the car alarm and steal the car, and Arnold's character switched off the alarm by lifting up the front end.  Later, it turned out the trunk of the car had some sort of McGuffin that led to the villain pursuing the main characters to get it back.
> Is printing the empty list the only concrete flaw in the code?\n\nNo.  I glanced a bit too quickly.  It looks like printList also fails when the list isn't empty.\n\nIf you were expected to compile and test your code before submitting it, then I can definitely understand why he would have heavily penalized you.  While it's understandable that you may have overlooked testing printList on an empty list, it's less understandable that you didn't try testing it at all.\n\nEdit: Also, removeFront deletes the entire list and returns the last element.  removeBack works correctly unless the list is empty, in which case it crashes.\n\nEdit 2: insertOrdered is also broken.
> You don't seem to understand that the divisibility of 360 is only relevant in our number system\n\nThat's not true.  Divisibility is independent of the number system used.  It even has a physical analogue -- if you had 360 square tiles, there are 24 different filled rectangles you can create from them (or 12 if you consider the swapping the dimensions to still be the same rectangle).\n\nAlong similar lines, prime numbers (notable for their very limited divisibility) are the go-to mathematical concept for demonstrating and recognizing intelligence with regard to extra-terrestrial signals.  That's because the prime numbers are prime regardless of the base used.

Do you understand why your code is doing 5 - (20+10+10+10+10) instead of 5-20?

I think this is overlooking why keeping jobs in the U.S. is specifically a political issue rather than just a business/consumer one.\n\nThe U.S. has a lot of regulations to prevent the exploitation of workers and protect the environment.  While these rules aren't inherently bad, they do add to the cost of manufacturing products.  China has less regulations, so making stuff there will be cheaper (even factoring in transportation costs).  If a business tries to stick with U.S.-made products, they wind up at a disadvantage in the marketplace because the Chinese-made products can be sold for significantly less.\n\nSo even if he's always supported U.S. manufacturing, there's only so much he could have done as a business owner.

First, it's not illegal to posses sawed-off shotguns in the U.S.  Some individual states have banned them, but it's not illegal federally.  What federal law does require is that you comply with the terms of the [1934 National Firearms Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act).  It involves a paying a $200 transfer tax, submitting you fingerprints, a few other things, and waiting many months for ATF approval.  But if you jump through those hoops, you can have a sawed-off ("short barrel") shotgun.\n\nPrior to 1986, the NFA restrictions for machine guns were pretty much the same.  After 1986, [the Hughes Amendment to the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act#Ban_on_new_machine_guns) closed the registry to new machine guns.  However, any existing machine guns that were on the registry prior to the closure can still be transferred to new owners, provided the went through the same $200 tax, fingerprints, etc. process.  Because of the finite supply, the price of these transferable machine guns has continued to rise -- they cost at least 10 times what a new one would cost if new ones could be sold legally.\n\nGetting back to your question of why, I've heard that originally the NFA was going to require the same taxes and paperwork for pistols, due to their concealability.  Since they didn't want people getting around the pistol restriction by cutting down the barrel on a shotgun or rifle (which would then also be concealable), they included those.  When pistols wound up getting removed from the proposed law, short-barrel rifles and shotguns stayed in.  That's just what I heard though -- I can't confirm the accuracy of that information.

What happens if you call printList on an empty List?  That probably lost you a bunch of points, especially if the professor was using an automated grading framework and/or heavily penalizes you if your program crashes.\n\nIn terms of style, isEmpty is a lot wordier than it needs to be.  If you find yourself writing `if (someBoolean) { return true; } else { return false; }`, that's really just the same as `return someBoolean;`.\n\nFor removeFront and removeBack, passing in a variable to hold the return value seems unnecessary.  Instead, I'd have the method take no arguments and return a ListItemType.
The answer to the first question (why it should be -15) is because 10 is neither greater than 10 or less than 10.\n\nThe answer to the second question is because your code assumes that anything that isn't less than 10 is greater than 10, which means 10 is incorrectly lumped in with all the numbers greater than 10.  In order to fix this, you'll want to use a second conditional to confirm that the value is greater than 10.\n\nAs you program more, you'll get more and more experienced at catching edge cases like this.   It's one of the fundamental skills that will develop over time and practice (and even then, experienced programmers still miss weird cases from time to time).
> Give the test to 100 people. Line them up from lowest answers correct to highest. Start at the bottom and count up. Person #50 has the mean score and has an IQ of 100.\n\nYou just described the median, not the mean.  The mean is the way of averaging that most people are familiar with -- sum up all the scores and divide by the number of scores.\n\nEdit: Added "of"
I haven't dug through everything, but I did find one mistake (repeated 3 times).  Each time you `malloc`, you use `sizeof` incorrectly.  For example, from `create_linked_list` line 9 in list.c:\n\n    linked_list *list = (struct list_node*)malloc(sizeof(list));\n\nThe problem with this is that `sizeof(list)` returns the size of the variable `list` itself, which is just a pointer.  What you really want is the size of what you intend list to point to, in other words `sizeof(linked_list)`.
> Keep in mind though, he will probably say no since he still hasn't decided yet if the two of you are ready for marriage.\n\nI think it's also worth keeping in mind that a rejected proposal frequently fatally wounds a relationship, especially when a key problem with the proposal is the proposer ignoring previously stated wishes of the proposee.  If the proposee has already said they aren't ready, or they hate diamond jewelry, or they don't want a public proposal under any circumstances, then a proposer who ignores that shows they either don't understand their partner or don't care about their partner's views.
Looks like an order of operations issue.  In particular, the string concatenation operator (`.`) has the same precedence as addition and subtraction, so it gets processed left to right.  Addition involving a string that can't be interpreted as a number presumably treats it as 0, which would explain your output.\n\nFor example, looking at the first broken line:\n\n    echo "Lorem ipsum " . $a * $b + $b . " euro <br />";\n\nThis is the same as:\n\n    echo ("Lorem ipsum " . ($a * $b)) + $b . " euro <br />";\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n    echo ("Lorem ipsum " . 200) + $b . " euro <br />";\n\n    echo ("Lorem ipsum 200") + $b . " euro <br />";\n\n    echo (0) + $b . " euro <br />";\n\n    echo 20 . " euro <br />";\n\n    echo "20 euro <br />";\n
> Just to add some information. Dongle didn't used to mean "adapter"\n\nI think (but I'm not sure) that dongle may have always been a bit generic in nature -- similar to widget but with a small, pluggable connotation.  So adapters would have been included.  However, because copy-protection dongles didn't really have another popular name besides dongle, dongle was more closely associated with them than with other dongles.  I could be wrong.\n\n> I believe it may even predate USB. So it would need to connect to a serial or com port or something similar.\n\nThey absolutely do.  They'd also often behave as a pass-through since a typical PC wouldn't necessarily have extra serial or parallel ports.  2 serial ports and 1 parallel port was a fairly common setup, and you'd use 1 serial port for your mouse, 1 for your external modem, and the parallel port for your printer.
> Is this late?\n\nStrictly speaking, yes.  You turned it in after the cut-off time.  The cut-off was 9:00 PM, not 9:00:59.999 PM.\n\nThat being said, it's worth politely raising the point with the professor as others have suggested.\n\nBut in the future, keep in mind that there isn't a 60 second grace period with deadlines, particularly when they're being enforced by a computer.  And even in the real world, a deadline will usually represent the point where someone will lock the door or clock out and leave; it may be easier to talk them into accepting a technically late submission, but it's still technically late.
I think this is the most important bit: "Today we are replacing the rate-based retrieval fees with simpler per-GB pricing."\n\nIt's long overdue.  Glacier retrieval prices used to be a poorly explained gotcha where you got charged based on the highest rate of retrieval in any 4-hour period during the month.  Now it's just a per-GB fee with 3 speed options (standard, fast, and slow).
> If you're going to be searching for it, you probably want to actually read further in case there are more details.\n\nI think you're looking at it the wrong way.

If the title says, "[TOMT][MOVIE] Some guy on an island prison", I click through and start reading the details to see if it's [No Escape](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110678/).

> 90% of men in America are under 6ft in height.\n\nWow.  Couple that with the fact that 2/3rds of Americans are overweight (and thus are unlikely to fulfill her criteria about being active), and she's looking at 3% of the male population just from the height and activity criteria alone.  Those are tough odds even without the sex angle.
It's actually been a while.  Long ago (mainly pre-reddit), this sort of thing used to be my bread and butter.  These days, I tend to stick more to answering factual stuff, but occasionally I get inspired.
> It's not EXACTLY the same, but similar enough.\n\nI really don't agree.  There's a big difference between "Boyfriend kept dodging her questions and she was upset," and "The discussion has hit stalemate and any attempts to develop it further turn into a childish dialogue. I'm now being accusing of coming across a very selfish for not being appreciative of the gift."\n\nThe wife's behavior is really edging into emotionally abusive territory.  She's got her husband doubting himself enough that he's coming in here asking if he really is selfish.  Even if this were a surprise, she's handling it all wrong.\n\n> Boyfriend was a terrible liar and wouldn't have been able to keep his story straight if he had made up fake plans.\n\nIf that boyfriend were here asking for advice, I would have suggested something along the lines of, "I've got a few interesting things planned, but I'd rather keep them a secret until the last moment.  I genuinely believe you will enjoy yourself."  Short, to the point, and no lies to keep straight, but it also preserves the essence of the surprise.  Regardless, I would not recommend that he abuse his girlfriend with false accusations to keep her off-guard.
> Mentally, he's had pretty significant anxiety for most of his life, but even when he gets really bad he's never just...left.\n\nTechnically speaking, the problem wasn't him leaving -- everything started with a normal trip to visit friends.  Instead, the issue is that he never came back.  I bring this up not to be pedantic but because it may explain what's going through his head, particularly when combined with what you said about living with your toxic aunt elsewhere.\n\nKeeping that in mind, here's my speculation about what's going on with him:\n\nHe goes to visit his friends.  Just a normal visit.  And it's nice.  Towards the end of that first visit, he's starting to dread coming back and dealing with your toxic aunt.  So he just keeps putting off coming home, and eventually he falls asleep on the couch.\n\nYou text him, he responds telling you about falling asleep and indicating he'll grab a bus.  But each time, he still gets that same anxious dread about dealing with your aunt.  Maybe he talks about it to his friends, and they explicitly offer support.  Or maybe he just keeps hanging around, and they don't shoo him out the door.  Either way, the more he avoids having to deal with the situation, the less bad his anxiety is.  Next thing you know, four days have passed.\n\nBut again, that's just one possibility.\n\nRegardless of whether or not I'm right, I think attempting to actually talk with him over the phone is a good first step towards resolving things.  And having this possibility in mind may help in terms of getting him to open up about what's really going on.
Generally, running configure generates the makefile.  So it sounds like something probably went before running make.  Try running `./configure` again and paying attention to the output.  It'll almost certainly still fail, but it should give you a more useful error to track down.

Short version: Download [Frotz](http://frotz.sourceforge.net/) (or any other Z-machine interpreter) and point it at AMFV.DAT.\n\nThe longer explanation: Infocom games (including AMFV) used a machine-independent byte code ([Z-machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine)) for their games.  Due to the popularity of the games, people have made modern interpreters (such as Frotz) which can run the games.  This generally provides a much nicer experience than trying to run the interpreter that came with the original game.
24 divisors is slightly arbitrary, but it represents the highest amount until you get to 720 (which has 30 divisors).  In other words, 360 is an especially useful number when you want to divide it up into pieces, but it's not the only such useful number.  So aliens might use something other than 360, but they'd likely recognize 360 as being a useful number rather than something completely arbitrary.

The only catch is that it won't erase what's already on the line, so you need to keep that in mind when replacing stuff.  You'll also probably need to manually flush the buffer (lookup `fflush`) since it normally only gets flushed when you print a newline.\n\nDoing anything more sophisticated with cursor-movement gets into the area of system-specific code.  Under Unix, it'll be something like curses.  Under Windows, there's a console API.

Archival Blu-ray seems to be a reasonable (albeit slightly pricey) option that you can just sock away.  Otherwise, your best bet is to just keep moving the data to newer storage as time goes on.  In either case, you'll want to ensure you've got multiple copies in multiple locations for anything important.
It also didn't help that, during the first year of the invasion, Hitler focused on capturing Moscow instead of the south (breadbasket and oil fields, would have done even more massive economic harm to the Soviets and propped up the shaky German economy). Then in the second year, he focused on capturing the south (Stalingrad) rather than finishing the job at Moscow and cutting off the rail networks there.

> Wouldn't if be even greater still if that compensation went to the creator? I don't see how compensating the publisher is going to encourage more creation.\n\nThe creator was still compensated when they sold the rights to the publisher.\n\nThe creator may benefit from having a more predictable and upfront source of income.  The publisher may benefit from realizing more money in the long-run because they shouldered the risk and marketed the creation.  In the cases of major motion pictures and AAA video games, the publisher may be fronting multiple millions of dollars to fund the creation of the work and pay the creators for their time.\n\nThere are many cases where the creators get screwed and end up selling the rights to their creations for a fraction of what they're worth (typically music).  However, I don't think that's a reason to throw out the ability of creators to sell their rights.  I also think that the internet opens up a lot of opportunities for creators to self-publish and self-promote so they can either retain all the rights to their creations or broker a more favorable deal when selling the rights to those creations.

The article you linked seems to have a decent answer:\n\n> Why was Kelly acquitted? Quoting the Slate article by Josh Levin of June 13 2008 - "As Kelly's lawyers mentioned multiple times, the alleged victim in this case—now a 23-year-old woman—told a grand jury that it wasn't her. While 15 friends and relatives testified that the girl in question was indeed on the video, neither the alleged victim nor her parents showed up in court to testify for either side." The prosecution witness Lisa Van Allen was easily impeached as a witness due to her clearly sordid history with R. Kelly, others, and even soliciting a bribe from an investigator in the case.\n\nSo it sounds like a combination of a reluctant victim and a tainted prosecution.  Presumably that helped create just enough reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors.  Keep in mind that that's all it takes.
> P2P (peer to peer) means you are downloading directly from one other person. That's what Limewire does.\n> \n> \n> \n> Torrenting means you are downloading a file from multiple sources simultaneously.\n\nI don't think this is correct.  P2P is a general term for any system where the computers serving up data are on similar footing to the computers receiving data and any given computer may play both roles.  Whether or not the protocol allows files to be retrieved via multiple peers at once doesn't change whether or not a protocol is P2P.  Both the original Napster (downloading a file from a single peer source) and BitTorrent (downloading a file by getting chunks from multiple sources) are considered P2P.\n\nTorrenting refers to the BitTorrent protocol, which is a P2P protocol that rose to prominence due to its ability to effectively handle getting a file from multiple sources.\n\n> Neither of these is "worse"; they're both methods of distributing (and receiving) unlicensed copies of protected media.\n\nCopyright infringement is one of the most popular applications of P2P software (including BitTorrent), but it's not the only application.  At their core, they're just file transfer protocols.  BitTorrent in particular has found use in the official distribution of some Linux ISOs and MMO updates (both large files that see a huge spike in demand when initially made available).
Which type of tabloids are you talking about?  Celebrity gossip rags or "aliens stole my wife"-type tabloids?\n\nThe celebrity gossip rags are just trashy voyeurism and gossip.  There's presumably at least some truth to some of what they're reporting (especially if they've got pictures), but people who love juicy gossip aren't exactly known for demanding truth and accuracy.  Also, if the tabloid strays too far from the truth, they open themselves up to lawsuits (and they've certainly been sued in the past) -- that doesn't guarantee truth, but it at least adds a small check against the more egregious abuses of facts.\n\nAs for the "aliens stole my wife" tabloids, those ones best fit your claim about the majority of the stories being blatantly false.  However, what many critics miss is that the stories were meant as satire and entertainment.  The classic [Weekly World News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News) was essentially just a supernatural-themed predecessor of the Onion.
For removeFront, just change the `while` to an `if`, and you're good.  The way you had it, it would remove the first element over and over again, until the list was empty.

He closed the door to his bedroom and dimmed the lights.  "Have I already bought the clothes I will die in ?" rupert9bear nervously asked the mystic 8-ball that his friend had lent him.  He shook it and flipped it over, expecting an answer.\n\nHe watched the window on the bottom of the ball, but no words appeared.  Instead, a voice filled the air, "You're wearing them now.  Also don't look behind you."  Rupert9bear's blood ran cold.\n\nRealizing that he had one chance to escape his dire fate, rupert9bear began to strip.  If he were naked, the 8-ball's prophecy would be wrong, and he might not die.  He'd already gotten his shirt off when the hairs on the back of his neck insisted that something very evil and something very deadly was near.  He knew he had to get far away.  He flung the door open and moved with purpose.\n\nAs rupert9bear continued both undressing and fleeing, he risked a quick glance behind him.  Nothing of note.  Just an ordinary hallway and beyond that his ordinary room.  He even laughed at his own silliness until his momentum combined with the pants around his ankles to send him tumbling down the stairs.\n\nPM_ME_YOUR_PM_PHOTOS stepped out of the downstairs linen closet and found himself standing over the corpse of his friend, rupert9bear.

I'm saying the worst case scenario for someone should be ~$80k, but really you should be able to work a part-time job, 15 hours a week isn't absurd and even at minimum wage over four years you're reducing that debt to $55k.

And I don't think $30k is an unreasonable debt to owe for four years of room, board, and education.

If you're not an idiot your IRA won't go tits up when you need it.

The top takes a small cut (profits in the teens are phenomenal, single digits more common, losses not unknown), it's only big compared to a single workers pay. 
It's never too late. Start as soon as you can, though, because every year delayed is a year that money you put away can't work for you. Starting at 44 probably means you aren't going to retire early, but don't be one of those idiots who thinks, "Well, I'll never retire, I'll just work til I die."
Isn't it? The article says the spending numbers don't include international programs or interest, that's all.
Egg McMuffin only got 22% in Utah when he was running against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. He wouldn't get half of that running against Orrin Hatch.
Rednecks like over-engineered shit. How many broke-ass twenty-something southerners drive around in a $45,000 quad cab V8 pickup, likely lifted and with a brush guard? Now, how many of those actually use that truck for anything that the average 4-door sedan or Ford Ranger couldn't do?
If it's the same story I'm thinking of, it was a city fire department responding to a fire in the unincorporated county. The county hadn't set up their own fire department, or paid the city to contract for services, they were pretty much banking on a free ride. The city told county residents they could pay a fire fee, or not get services. They also promised to save lives no matter what, just not property. Seems fair to me. 
I'd guess a large majority of Hawaii state representatives don't speak Hawaiian.
Are you being sarcastic? Because wool does retain a lot of its insulating quality when wet. 
He wasn't trying to right any injustices though. He might have exposed injustices, but the ratio of injustice to harmful sensitive info was like 1:100.
Doesn't seem that high. What is a fair price to pay to keep a room, doctor, nurse, and support staff waiting around 24/7 for the time you actually need it?
I'd imagine if you call the FSU golf course they could set you up with something pretty cheap. If you're a student yourself, I think FSU offers a golf course for credit. 
You've got to include the fact that any random American you sleep with only has a 1/300 chance of having HIV in the first place (granted, it's very disproportionate in certain populations). So back if the napkin it's more like 1 in 375000. 
Just replied to the main comment, but I saw this and figured I'd answer here too. I live in Magnolia Heights and it's a good neighborhood. I'd suggest renting a house or townhouse in the area, the apartments are somewhat ghetto from what I can tell. There's a lot of nice places on the north side of Park Avenue as well.\n\nJust be aware that there is a train track that runs near the area, freight trains come through multiple times a day/night. It isn't really a bother for me, but if you were to live in one of the houses near the tracks at surface level (rather than below grade in a cut), I imagine the horn would shake you out of bed every night.
Thats a total of B18 more bomber for the same price!
Yeah, the key is that you can't sell off your portfolio because "OMG it lost money!" Which, considering we're mandating people save in the first place, shouldn't be that hard to do. $10,000 invested in a total stock market index in 2007 (before the crash) would be ~$20,000 now. But what if you needed to retire in the meantime? That's why you make people invest in target retirement funds that shift portions over to safer investments as you age, so that you can sell off the safe investments for near-full value in a temporary downturn while the rest of your portfolio recovers.
The "fighting words" defense has been greatly diminished over time.
Yeah, I remember it being a HUGE deal in high school to get your Bright Futures application in on time, or else.
Yeah, this means that if someone is literally blocking your car into your driveway, you need to first wait for a cop to ticket them, and then wait for a tow truck to remove it.
I recently drove I-70 from Utah into Colorado at night, and as a lifelong speeder, I was just totally blown away by how fast people were driving. Windy road, dark as could be, people just zooming along at 90mph when I'm whiteknuckling it at 70.
How many hundreds of children did Obama kill in his drone attacks? Collateral damage is a bitch. 
But for a lot of people, it does. Nearly two-thirds of retirees get half or more of their income from Social Security. People would be almost universally better off if they were allowed to invest the money taken for Social Security into almost any sort of investment short of Bernie Madoff.
I thought free and fair elections were the backbone of democracy?
Everything else aside, Tillerson definitely has experience for the role. Exxon has its own foreign policy, economy, and security forces, as well as contacts in basically every geopolitical hotspot. 
I'm not saying they're lazy degenerates. I'm saying I may have one possible reason they aren't doing that well economically.
Basically any religion you don't like?
Ahhh, got to live this show. Aaron Sorkin writing arguments for Aaron Sorkin to win with himself. A main character who is seemingly a Republican only for the purposes of him being able to say "I'm a Republican and I agree with the left!"
Not sure why you're being downvoted. A huge percentage of Tallahassee's air passengers are flying on someone else's dime, and so don't care about the price. 
A permanent temporary flight restriction. How ironic. 
The German supply problems on the Eastern Front weren't necessarily because of Hitler's insanity, except as the reason the Germans were there in the first place. The Nazi economy was far weaker than people realize, a lot of shortages on the front were simply due to lack of a product or the ability to transport it. 
My family owned a tow company, and someone tried to do this to us. Just told them no. They called the police. Cop said I had to take pennies. I asked the police to show me what statute required me to take pennies. The cop then decided it was a civil matter and left.\n\nDidn't take the pennies.
I know, but it depends on what the electoral map looks like. In 2018, the Democrats will have 25 Senate seats up for reelection (several of which are in states that Trump won handily), while the Republicans only need to defend 8. To just tie the Senate (which leaves VP Pence as the deciding vote), Democrats would need to hold every single seat they're defending, as well as win two Republican seats.\n\nAnd just getting a one or two vote majority doesn't do much for the Democrats in terms of impeachment. That requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove someone from office.\n\nSimply put, impeachment isn't going to happen so long as Trump has at least overt support from Senate Republicans, and that isn't going to change until the voters who supported Trump start defecting en masse. Street protests from liberals aren't doing much to convince Congressional Republicans.
Pompano?
I'm with you on this one. Driving back is basically the same as soaking yourself in gasoline and then driving around on a riding lawnmower... could be fine, or you could end up with a Darwin Award.
Some were armed and used to guard against local anti-colonial movements. 
Canada's big contribution was in the Battle of the Atlantic, and in the air war in Europe. They had the world's fourth largest navy by the end of the war, and really helped keep supplies flowing to Britain and the Soviets. 
Because I was involved in the College Republicans at FSU when I was in undergrad, and for them to have $16,000 in the bank (or not in the bank, as the case may be) would be a massive improvement in fundraising capacity over what I saw just four years ago. And I'm personally familiar with the people currently involved in the club, and again I just don't them fundraising that much money.\n\nTheir modus operandi has been to fundraise all year to pay for their annual gala (kinda the opposite of what you'd expect, but hey).\n\nA campus engineering club is a pretty easy sell to sympathetic donors. The College Republicans are dead last on the list of who political donors want to donate to.
Funny, but really I think it's because the local merchants basically kicked the NOPD out and paid the state for state police presence in the quarter. 
Good lord, the URM boost is massive too. If you look at the raw numbers, the number of black students admitted to Harvard Law is roughly equal to the total number of black students who have LSAT/GPAs competitive for the entire Top 14.
Yeah, they're not protesting for anything in particular. This march will be good for having the marchers make friends and feel good about themselves, but they'd have accomplished far more donating the cost of their plane tickets and accommodations to a political cause and volunteering their time for that cause.
Definitely not the X-37, it lands at the Shuttle Landing Facility.
Knowing several TPD officers, I assure you they are all too lazy to beat someone for no reason. A beating is hard work!
Probably not, you've got to get the power to consumers. 
No, but there is information on contacting the IG to report wrongdoing, lots of training for that.\n\nRelease the documents to the NY Times, or your Congressman... anyone who will vet the documents and edit out harmful information before release.
Any American who graduates from undergrad with $100k in loans is an idiot, and no amount of free school is going to change that.\n\nTo be fair, the only place I can talk about with real experience is Florida, but since we have an extremely limited state government and are often referred to as the worst state in the US for free government stuff, I feel like it's a fair representation. Total annual cost of attendance at the flagship state university is just over $18,000. That includes tuition, fees, books, housing, and meal plan. So if you don't have any money from family, any scholarships or grants, and don't work a single hour all through college, you'd still end up with a four-year degree at under $80k. And in Florida, most college-bound students are qualified to get free tuition and fees through Bright Futures. 
It's not because capitalism, it's because you want people to pay for their own tows. The Coast Guard is a lifesaving service, not aquatic AAA. 
I signed up after 9-11.
France and Britain after the war were the archetype of "good" government debt, though. The debt was huge after the war, but their economies grew significantly faster than the debt did, so after a few decades the money owed was relatively insignificant.
It's like the Democrats looked at the ashes of their party after the past election, and said, "you know what, the problem is we didn't have enough identity politics!"
You get plenty of federal funding, just not as much as the feds get in income tax.
That or Mongolia. 
Yes, but they've permanently moved the entire program to the SLF and former Orbiter Processing Facilities 1 and 2.
Do you think the treatment of Germany by the victors between the Armistice and the Treaty was "fair?" That seems like the biggest injustice, at least in the minds of the Germans. Germany fell back and mostly demobilized, expecting an equitable peace treaty, but the British continued the blockade and the French continuously threatened to resume the war on the ground. 
I guess what I'm saying is, impeachment isn't going to happen so long as rank-and-file Republicans like Trump. You need to give Republican Senators an electoral reason to remove him, and that isn't going to happen by driving Republicans closer to him.\n\nAlso, I'm a Republican who voted for the other side and I'm as guilty as the neo-nazis? Jeez, no wonder the Democrats lose continuously.
This is mostly for the Capitol crowd and state office workers to go somewhere to get lunch. Not really sure it'll catch on as parking isn't the limiting factor for them, it's time.\n\nAlso, what happened to the trolleys the city started like a year ago? The Rhythm one?
Bad example, considering the past five (maybe more) Secretaries of Agriculture weren't farmers.

Long thankless days? Isn't the school day normally like six hours? Two more hours for work you took home, and you're still not breaking a nine-to-five schedule.
The Supreme Court prefers to interpret federal regulations in a way that doesn't preempt state law. 
Lots of things are the same price or cheaper than they used to be. Things like healthcare and education bring the average up. 
Yep. We've definitely got some of the best value universities in the country in FSU and UF.
It's 2017, it's only possible to care about one thing at a time anymore. 
So if you look into the full video (not the heavily edited one Wikileaks released) and the context of the situation, it's not so cut and dry. American troops had come under fire just a few blocks away, and this group of people are moving towards that direction, some of whom clearly have rifles and others who have things that look like RPGs (we now know that these were guards and cameras, but the pilot hovering over a combat zone didn't know that).
If Roosevelt was so well liked, why after he served more than two terms did we immediately change the Constitution to say "let's never do that again?"
It's worth noting that districts legally must be gerrymandered to some degree. States are required to draw their congressional districts so that there are a number of "minority-majority" districts in proportion to the minority's percentage of the population.
I mean, the US has massive support for colleges and universities as well. Anyone can get student loans for their undergrad on through professional school. Many states have effectively free tuition through various scholarship programs. Pell Grants give free tuition to poor students.\n\nNow, if you get an Underwater Feminist Basket Weaving degree, all that is going to do is leave you working at Starbucks and paying off your loans over the course of fifty years.
Well fuck me then.
I'm not sure why her not having gone to public schools is a negative. It's the Department of Education, not the Department of Public Education. She's not going to be directly running schools. The goal is to improve education as a whole, and it wouldn't be terrible to have someone who thinks beyond public schools for a change.\n\nIt'd be different if the public school system was a shining beacon of what government could accomplish, but, well...
Knobs and buttons on car radios, instead of touch screens. 
The rule is, you have to start UPT by your 30th birthday. Some units push the deadline forward because they expect delays in the process. Waivers are a real thing right now, though. 
We're commenting in a thread specifically related to Manning.
That's been my big complaint about the anti-Trump protests over the past few weeks. I'm sure they're good for making friends while marching, Facebook posts, and general virtue-signalling, but the only way you're going to stop Trump is convince Republicans to fight against him too. All the marches are doing is making moderate Republicans think this Trump guy might have something going for him after all.
Don't live in any big apartment complex unless you want to be overcharged for student housing.\n\n$1100 a month is more than enough to rent a decent house. Especially if it's just the two of you, you can get a 3 bedroom / 1 bath at a good price, as most people don't want to share a bathroom, and they're pretty common.
The Iraqi insurgency definitely got stopped by the US. They couldn't stop trying to fight conventionally, and we slaughtered them for it. The Surge worked. 
It's ironic, because stealing factories and other capital and letting it sit idle was something the Nazis did to occupied territories. They just couldn't get over the idea that hauling back loot wasn't an effective economic strategy in the modern era.
In the 19th century, though?
So when 98 whackos and two serious candidates run for office, they each get 1% of the funding?
I'm a Republican who voted for Clinton, and my views on Trump's decisions so far range from terrible (Muslim ban, Jeff Sessions), to fine (DeVos), to great (Gorsuch). But the liberal hysteria (especially pre-Muslim ban) has gone to great lengths in making me doubt I'll vote for a Democrat again.\n\nIf you think there's simply no point in trying to reason with Republicans, then just give up trying to stop Trump (in a legal manner) for the next four years. Because it isn't going to happen without Republicans.\n\nA specific example is the evangelicals. It should have been very easy for Democrats to drive a wedge between religious, family-values Republican voters, and Donald Trump, but every time a pro-Planned Parenthood group protests Trump the evangelicals shift a little further into his corner. I'm all for standing up for what you believe in, when it makes a difference, but if standing up for what you believe in hurts your cause, sit the fuck down.

I disagree - look at Vietnam and the middle East. Under equipped and under trained (by comparison to the us military) caused significant problems to the military. A large uprising in the us would not be so easily quelled. 
Only if they take possession of the firearm (ie pick up the checked bag). In that unlikely event, they'd want to talk to the airline personnel first.
I am genuinely excited for this.
Is it an IWB holster? Usually those rely on having tension from being worn to get full tension.
You can always post on /r/FindAUnit - either make a new post looking for a unit or post on someone who has posted a unit ad. There are groups that are friendly to new groups.
Because an AR-15 > shot gun or pistol for home defense. The round is more effective at stopping a threat, you have better magazine capacity, low recoil, and it's easy to handle.
You're weird.
Can be. 
How is reducing the number of guns going to help with the overall crime rate if we won't treat the causes of the violent crime?
That's perfect, thanks!
But think of all the airliners that could be shot down with .50 caliber rifles!
Technically the AR-15 came first, then the military adopted it through several different variants until we had the M16 and later the M4.\n\nBut they are largely the same, the fire control group is different and until the last decade or so, the bolt carrier was different so it couldn't engage with full auto trigger groups. The lower receiver is also usually milled differently so that a full auto trigger group cannot be installed.
And the AR-15 that is on the civilian market today is not an M16. They are not full auto
Chicks! Dig! Giant robots!
Bravo sir, bravo.
Whatever the manufacturer of the receiver labeled it as. But the AR-15 that is sold on the market as semi auto is different than what the military uses.\n\n\nEdit : whatever I'm a dumbass and wrong. Had a shitty day at work so I'm done. 
And when we're done reading it, we can watch Rick and Morty Season 3!
How is a HK416 deadlier than a Mini-14?
In other words, the US could win if they went with a scorched earth policy. That would almost certainly never happen. Especially on our own soil, so it's a moot point.
I looked at saw who it was. That racist prick. 
Don't be afraid to come back and ask question! Arma is a lot of fun once you get past the steep learning curve and learn to slow down a bit.
Hmm, I'd contact them and see what they say. Don't want a holster that lets the gun wiggle, uncomfortable.
And I ask, why?
> guns had one purpose and one purpose only...to kill\n\nWeird, mine must be broken since they just punch holes in paper or splatter steel targets.
Even when they leave their reddit username in your voicemail? :P
They've resorted to manufacturing their own guns in places where they can't be readily bought - i've seen articles where illegal sub machine guns have been discovered in places where there are high gun regulations.
Gotta be a troll.
What?
So you don't make a mess probably.
That looks awesome actually. How well does the BDC (so to speak) part of it work?
How does not being able to handle finances translate to "shouldn't have a gun?" Because I've yet to see any proof that because someone is bad with money makes them violent or dangerous. Is there overlap? Probably, but we have the courts or 72 hour holds for handling those cases as they come.
That addresses one type of crime, and does nothing to actually address the root cause or other types of crime. Plus, the USA has a lot more guns than any other country. It would take decades to make an appreciable dent in the number of guns in circulation. It'd be a better use of time and resources to treat the cause of crime and reduce it across the board. 
Funny how they criticize us for not going over there to debate, yet most if us are banned. 
If you had the money and knowledge to do it, you probably already would.
Clean and lube then shoot again, and have someone else shoot. What type of ammo were you shooting? My brother's PX-4 compact in 9mm has never malfunctioned on us.
A true M4 will have full auto or burst, depending on variant.
Growing a brothel tree?
I've got a grd mount for my acog. How's that compare? I got it for a steal at my local gun store. 
This is a very fundamental thing to guns, not just rifles.

Maybe at the beginning, back in the 60's, but these days I would argue that they are two different designs now. The military designated M16/M4 series have different FCG's and (until semi-recently) different bolt carriers. They're different enough in my mind due to their different functional characteristics to give them two different designations.
If it's not in the contract, and that contract states that it's the whole agreement, they're going to have a very, very tough battle.
They didn't.

News tomorrow: Philippine Senator executed by Duterte for smoking marijuana.
I see. The standard interpretation I've seen is that arms was supposed to mean standard infantry weapons such as muskets (and in modern times, our current crop of long guns and hand guns). But the founding fathers also owned cannon (which we can still own today).\n\nSo do you feel that things like artillery and properly equipped tanks are 2nd amendment protected? Just trying to have a genuine conversation.
That usually ends up with me breaking all my solar panels and my crew freezing to death in the cold vacuum of space. Wait were we talking about KSP?
What do you mean firearms are not mentioned in the 2A?
How's it compare to the MAAD mount?
They're the same in that the receivers are almost identical, but they are functionally and internally different.
A semi auto AR-15 is NOT an M16. Do you not understand this?
Go look through his posting history. It's not very clear at all if they actually served or not.
Weirdly I cant seem to get into it. I need to try it again, the times I've tried to watch I've always been doing other things. 
Domain blocked lol. Funnily enough I can preview it with RES but not go to the URL.
Probably would be cheaper over the long run to do that than hotels.
What a racist prick. 
The way I understand it, arms generally means something that a single person can wield, and doesn't cover explosives. So grenades and missiles and nuclear weapons wouldn't be protected.\n\nFun fact: You can actually legally own grenades, there's just a lot of hoops to jump through. They're classified as Destructive Devices and require a $200 tax to transfer them to private ownership along with paperwork to the government.
I have a 9th edition at home that I will check, but it will be a few hours.
Just go buy the stuff to make it at the store.
The cool thing is that they can be both.
You can fly with ammo, if it's properly boxed and it's < 11 pounds. Has to be checked and somewhat separate from the firearms.
Nope! That ringing noise you hear is just the sound of the pins dropping!
Wild pigs are not usually good eating, from what I understand in SE Alabama.
Got a link to that comment?
It's in the Constitution.. what's your specific complaint?
Funnily enough, anti gun politicians want to remove veterans' right to possess guns because they have these feelings after being ordered over there!
Is the gun clean and lubed? What ammo?
Wew lad.
It's Indiana to Texas, neither one regulates them like Massachusetts or Illinois does requiring a license. OP is fine.
Technically the original AR15 did before it was officially adopted by the military, before full production.
No, because they are functionally different. An AR-15 I buy at Academy or Gander Mountain is not the same as a dealer sample or a military issued rifle. What about that do you not understand?
How's this? http://i.imgur.com/7vs3sVD.jpg 
We release genetically modified mosquitoes to poison them!
What about Nissan v8's? Out of curiosity. 
Gotcha.
That falls into the realm of ordnance, not arms. Besides, it's not like nuclear weapons are affordable.
*whoosh*
1) The SSA even admits that many SSDI recipients with designated payees are not adjudicated incompetent.\n2) The SSA lacks the medical qualification and judicial authority to adjudicate the status of mental incompetence.\n3) Do you have any statisics that cite disproportionate danger from those with a SSDI designated payee, but not otherwise designated as a prohibited person?\n4) If someone is a danger to themselves or others due to mental illness, there is already a process where doctors and judges that actually have the relevant qualifications and authority are involved.

Why would you even ask this?
How often are you looking at playing (ie how many times a week)? I am part of a group that usually plays Friday nights or Saturday afternoon, schedule permitting. Our groups is called SeaOps, we're around 10 regular players (trying to up that).\n\nWe try to be casual with low commitment and have a democratic group. What I mean by that is there's no set rank structure and anyone can be anything (we just ask that you have a fair idea of how to do something before stepping up). Low commitment - the main organizers (ninja edit: currently two, including me) propose a time and put things together if there's enough interest. You won't be kicked out for not being around. That rolls in with our focus on being democratic - we want everyone to have a voice and be able to give feedback, ideas, and to lead when they want to.\n\nSo if you think you might want to talk to us more, feel free to reply to me or PM me.\n\nOur basic mod list:\n\n* RHS (by far the biggest one, filesize wise)\n\n* A customized version of Ace\n\n* Task Force Radio\n\n* Shacktac UI\n\n* CBA_A3\n\n* A NVG mod\n\nThose are the mods that we do require for play since they add a lot of extra content and functionality to the game. We have it set up so it can all be added via Steam, and we have a couple of guys who work in IT and can help with any installation issues (myself included!).

No other historically discriminated against group of people have struggled as hard as the lower class of African Americans. Discrimination doesn't prevent them from forming their own positive forces in their communities. The problem is that they think they need to rely on more fortunate people instead of each other. Every other group that came to this country and faced discrimination overcame it by forming tight knit communities and relying on internal forces to overcome. Ex: Chinese, Japanese, Irish, Italian, polish, Jewish.

Good way to look like a puss if you're around the kind of men who appreciate that kind of handshake. Its not about establishing dominance its about how one reacts to it. If you react like a man you have a chance to gain a few respect points just by squeezing someone's hand.
Barely ever heard of this Spencer fellow and I've been deeply involved with /pol/ since it was /new/. /pol/ being where the actual "alt right" coalesced. The thing about that alt right though is its mostly teenagers and other shitposters who are more interested in funny memes than actual politics.

He was denying them because lower class African Americans destroy every community they come into contact with, not because their skin is black.
Here's my rebuttal. The Africans that were stolen from Africa hadn't reached the same level of civilization that Chinese had so how can you expect them to integrate into a modern society? But that's really going down the rabbit hole and those kinds of truths fget you banned.

The problem is telling black people they live in an oppressive world where they have no chance unless a white man grants them that chance. Their culture grew around this ideal and instead of promoting wholesome means every day they are blasted with how the only way to make money and get rich is to be a gangbanger that sells drugs.  They glorify the shitty situation they exist in and blame external influences, failing to take responsibility for their own situations. Its a toxic state of mind that is pushed on them by neo liberals and their own culture.

>On Thursday, North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore said legislators would not meet the federal government’s deadline.\n\n>“We will take no action by Monday,” Moore told reporters in a video broadcast by the Raleigh News & Observer. “That deadline will come and go. Obviously, we don’t ever want to lose any money, but we’re not going to get bullied by the Obama administration to take action prior to Monday’s date. That’s not how this works.”\n\nA bit more to that quote than the headline gives on. They're defying the Monday deadline, not saying indefinitely.\n
To be a little fair, even the illusion of impropriety cast on the supreme court is a serious issue, or at least you'd think so.
It's not that bad, especially in that list, but it was uncomfortable to watch mostly for the animal cruelty, followed by the obvious exploitation of native peoples. I had no idea what the movie was about and picked it based on the title, assuming it was a super campy horror movie. Nope, it wasn't.

Shady McGee summed it up.\n\nNon-billable hours are just ones that are  "eaten" by your company. Some are planned, like your training, by accounting for overhead in employee billing rates. Others aren't, like going over budget. You wouldn't technically bill to a non-billable code in that event, your company just couldn't invoice those excess hours.\n\nIn any case, definitely talk to whoever is managing the job you're working on. They might want more hours put somewhere billable.
Agreed.
Thanks for the detail. Is this unique to Virginia, or commonwealths in general, or is it a unique thing on its own?

Can you speak to the uniqueness of independent cities, either in Virginia's context or in general?
You definitely need clarification on when it was supposed to happen. Raises where I work start on the following pay period, which is never a month and a half away.
White water? No. I've worked in streams and rivers doing fish sampling, mussel surveys, benthic sampling, and SAV surveys but never in anything classified as white water. It's either wading or barge shocking. If I'm working on a boat in rough water it's only because it's choppy ocean water.\n\nIt might be out there, I have no idea.

I'm genuinely curious if yelling at a specific individual and saying you want to bash their skull in with a rock and rape their children is not considered any of those. I'm not entirely sure if threatening an individual or white people/Asian people en masse is totally ok.
You've got a new subscriber, after your south park one, and this, looking forward to your other animations.
I had a skype interview with 4 people at this company years ago and we were referencing south park and laughing. Was offered the job.

OP (/u/SushiAndWow) is a douche, and a racist phrenologist.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3htb3d/cmv_the_black_community_is_perpetuating/cuaiypt\n\nhttps://archive.is/KBuMv\n\n>It is unfortunate that most people are not in a position to understand this, but my honest, not hateful assessment is that the main challenge to black integration is a heritable, lower than average IQ, which happens to be correlated with an obvious superficial feature (skin color).\nThe lower than average IQ causes a higher than average incidence of difficulties and a perception of incompetence which, instead of being pinned on an individual, is pinned on skin color due to our tendency toward in group / out group dynamics.\nStereotypes that don't have a kernel of truth to them will generally dissipate. Asians have integrated well despite similar challenges. With blacks, the stereotypes persist because they are, on average, true, and folks aren't willing to accept blacks as they are. Instead, half the population wants to shun them; while the other half is appalled by this, but cannot counter this, because they're reacting either out of ignorance, due to lack of personal experience and media coverage that systematically downplays differences; or out of zealotry - wanting to pretend that the stereotypes aren't true.\nGhettoes are created not because black people go there to escape the shunning, but because the whites leave, afraid of lowering living standards and rising crime rates, which become a self fulfilling prophecy. This does not help blacks at all, since now they're stuck in communities with low average IQ, where everyone is shunned, and there are no role models.\nThere are only two ways this issue will realistically resolve itself.\nOne is that, either via genetic engineering or a few more centuries of mixing, the IQ difference will shrink; it already has compared to the much larger difference between IQs in the west and those in sub-Saharan Africa, and that can be attributed to mixing that has already happened.\nThe other way is for the white person to accept the black person for who he is; even if that means lower than average IQ, and an increased need for patience and kindness. But this would require both the liberals to understand that there are differences to begin with; and for everyone to not take the existence of these differences as a cause for hatred.\nThere's not much blacks can do about this, because by definition, the problem is the white person's lack of acceptance. It doesn't much matter what dysfunctional culture the black people adopt as long as the reason is that they are, quite simply, being shunned. You can't shun a whole group of people whose average IQ is 85 - 90 and expect that they will build a Singapore. No, since we're pushing them away - or rather, escaping from them into suburbs - they end up building ghettoes.\nLow IQ people in general, but especially those easily identifiable as such, need substantial and very long term help, and the situation will not improve until the rest of the population is really willing to give it; instead of ignoring them, abusing them, and stuffing them in prisons.\nBut that would require the average American to care for someone other than themselves, and to move away from an individualistic culture. We can't help this entire population if the mindset is "don't tread on me", and "everyone for themselves".\nI'm sorry if this comes across as hateful. This is honestly my genuine, best-faith assessment of the situation. Unfortunately, if this is the truth, it strokes no one's ego, and supports no ideology; it's hard for it to be loved by anyone.
Psychology is a soft science, but it's solid compared to gender studies. 
I accidentally read an article about Lamar Smith going after NOAA on some very conservative website today. The comment section wasn't even infuriating, it was just disheartening. People think it's just one big conspiracy to make money, some communist agenda. It's just sad what politics tries to do with science.
Beat me to it. Loved that guy's site.
Apparently not if they've killed a significant proportion of their allowed take in 6 weeks of a 30 week (over 3 years) project.
He did his fair share of obtuse readings, just see his own contradictory narrow reading of dictionary terms in White City Shopping Center v PR Restaurants, and State ex rel. Miller v Claiborne. In the first he insisted that burritos and tacos are not included in a ban on selling sandwiches. In the second he claimed that the lower court held that roosters are not animals, while the lower court actually found that fowl were not in the protected class of animals.\n\nNo judge is consistent, and his claims of originalism aren't either.
The gist is that the Las Vegas paper got an assignment to drop everything and monitor a judge and two others they chose. Turns out the judge was presiding over a case with the buyer of the paper. After not publishing, some tiny paper in Connecticut runs it. Turns out that paper is owned by someone with a connection. Really sketchy stuff.\n\n>Whether there was a link between the GateHouse-ordered court monitoring assignment, the critical article in New Britain and the sale of the RJ to the Adelson family remains unclear.\n\n>Michael Reed, CEO of New Media Investment Corp., the parent company of GateHouse Media, declined to comment when asked whether Adelson was involved in the court monitoring directive. He said the effort was part of a "multistate, multinewsroom" investigative effort initiated by GateHouse, but said he did not know who started it or how it was approved.\n\nFrom a more in depth article, also linked within.\n\nhttp://reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/judge-adelson-lawsuit-subject-unusual-scrutiny-amid-review-journal-sale\n

Bingo. I'm dealing with a much minor situation like this.\n\nSomeone backed into me, so their insurance took care of paying for the body work. Get my car back, there's a new chip, right by something that was removed according to the service report, interior pretty dirty. I call, leave messages, call again, show up in person, oh yeah we'll take care of that, hear nothing again for another week.\n\nCall up the insurance company handing the claim and tell them about it. They tell me they'll take care of it. Next business day, what do you know, get a call first thing from the shop asking me to bring it in. About two hours later I hear from the insurance company and how they visited the shop and took care of business.\n\nThe shop doesn't give a shit about you. They do care about loss of business, and referrals from insurance companies.\n\ntl;dr: People at insurance companies deal with these business for a living. Let them do it, they're good at it.
Pretty sure it's just a dead red tailed hawk. Even immature bald eagles don't look like that, and a golden eagle would be about twice that size. Stupid to go around punting dead things, but not a crime.
Can you not do it in store anymore?
Not entirely "all by itself" but I've seen the glass on an oven door just shatter when it was preheating. Not by closing the oven door either, just sitting there.
I believe you're mistaken, this is /r/funny.
Doing this again. Good luck all.

Any law can restrict a constituonal right, as long as it passes a constitutional test, whether it's rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny.
I refuse to unsubscribe.
I'm not alleging he refused cert for a quid pro quo, that's beyond insane. I'm saying a supreme court justice, any justice, should examine how things like this would be perceive. Illusion here meaning it allows people to make accusations exactly like the WP is making of Scalia. SC justices should appear squeaky clean because it not only reflects on them, but the highest court itself.\n\nAlso no need to attack me personally. I follow SC cases and listen to them regularly, so I have an interest in the SCOTUS itself.
Hello your honor.\n\nWhat made you choose law as your path in life, and what guides your decision making?\n\nAlso, what is your favorite supreme court hearing? Assuming you have one.\n\nEdit: nevermind, that was quick.

Hey Mike, I'm looking forward to seeing your movie. How did you enjoy your time on fart face fuckers 2, and when will we hear you in part 3?
You should have stuck around for the following two minutes or so. It stated how research shows that deviations from average speed of traffic are what are dangerous, and 5mph slower than average is more dangerous than 5mph faster than average. Those deviations make people have to slow down to pass on the right, and then pass again if there is another car in the cruising lane. It didn't imply slow drivers force others to act like idiots.
By tackling him after he stabbed the lead singer? I'd say he did a terrible job, but likes crushing little kids.
Heynong man, when is the next episode of that?
Just keep your mouth shut and give the news when it's official. There's nothing to gain by doing it early.
And it will be held up as an example of Federal overreach. Because states' rights trump the constitution, or something.
Tmo covers about 95% around where I live. That 5% is in the boonies. That number changes to maybe 80% when I'm travelling long distances, across states. I also have band 12 LTE coverage where I live. Price is very good on the truly unlimited data plan that I'm on with my brother. Their customer service has been great to deal with, especially coming from Verizon with a grandfathered unlimited plan.\n\nAny specific questions?
That's a good question, not a dumb one. Up to this point I would still have suggested craftsman, at least with wrenches (ratchet and crescent) and sockets, but I'm not sure.
How can you convince users that reddit isn't on the downward slide towards...I honestly can't remember the name of that site?

Since you sound like you may know this, who would remain exempt under this law?

Consider whether it's actually a problem or just a cliche to blame everything on wakelock issues at this point.\n\nI'm still not convinced by people looking at the battery use page. That's not very definitive proof to me, and me saying I haven't experienced this isn't going to convince people either.
Who uses Google maps for property information? You get the damn property boundaries yourself, reference the tax IDs, make a map yourself, and contact the appropriate person *before* bringing in the heavy equipment to tear it to the ground. This is idiotic.
So what was the story of the prequels?\n\nBoring space politics with over the shoulder camera shots, and a kid grows up and is mad all the time? Yawn.
Who picks the numbering scheme, and will it ever start at 1?
Oh my god, seriously? I've been looking for so many things to come up. They really dropped the ball with the UI cues in general.
That's basically people's opinion of them where I used to live. They were awesome, service was great. The only time there was an issue they sent a tech out who spent several hours fixing stuff, and ended up replacing the line to the house. I have fios now and while I haven't had major issues it's a struggle to get good support from them. I'd love to go back to cox.
I don't know if saying he ducked the question is that reasonable. In the majority opinion he wrote that it's possible that it's unconstitutional, but that case didn't present that issue, so they decided to narrowly decide it based on the physical trespass. 4 other justices agreed. When this case makes it there, and it will, we'll see another unanimous decision, or close to it. The minority opinion decided that a physical trespass wasn't necessary, and even Sotomayor agreed, so this case seems like a perfect test for that.
Bummer, I was going to suggest vice grips too. That's what I have to use.
I mean... There are two basic requirements for a Glock holster.\n\nDoes it retain the firearm to the belt?\n\nDoes it cover the entire trigger guard?\n\nThis one seems to do neither, but maybe it has redeeming qualities I'm not seeing. I also like a holster that covers the magazine release so I don't bump it accidentally, but that's just me.
Quantified? Maybe not. But when a field isn't predictive, useful, explanatory, or hypothesis-driven, it's pretty soft. 
I clicked on this thread wondering how far down I'd have to scroll to find my answer: top post! I'm so glad ConcernedApe made ten shitloads of money off that game. 
 > The historical cause of the problem isn't necessarily the problem itself, and doesn't necessarily point to a solution to the problem. \n\nIt is and does in this case. The historical cause of homophobia persists.\n\n> Even as the USA has become more secular, prejudice against homosexuals continues.\n\nHomophobia is becoming less popular as we become more secular. \n\n> Homophobia is a separate idea that can persist even without a religious root.\n\nCan it really? When has that happened?\n\n> And it's possible for people to reinterpret and adapt their religious views to not include homophobia.\n\nTotally, by shaving bits and pieces off their religion.\n
I guess I'm not really sure what a "trade war" is if we're not already in one with China. They steal our IP and manipulate the currency market. At what point do we say, "Shots fired?"
There aren't, and autism is a huge reason why I'm childfree. I taught special Olympics for years. The parents of the autistic children were the most broken people I've ever seen. The parents of the Down syndrome kids seemed upbeat by comparison. I'd be completely freaked out about the possibility at age 25, never mind age 35. 
And scripture is the basis of that belief. There are lots of [good examples](http://www.biblestudytools.com/topical-verses/bible-verses-about-abortion/).\n\nMost importantly, the Bible calls for magical thinking as a virtue. When magical thinking is respected, logical thinking becomes optional. 
It would probably have been hard to convince child-me that he would one day be attracted to butts. 
What's the root cause of the homophobia problem in Islam?
Maybe. I'm still hoping for the day when the legal system is totally overhauled and automated, like every other industry. It's amazingly inefficient. 
The right likes to say that since minorities get abortions, PP is eugenics. 
Right? This kid does sound pretty weird. I knew kids like this in middle school. Most of them matured out of it. 
Didn't Dillinger use one? 
> Religious persecution has been a huge problem throughout history\n\nPerpetuated by other religions. You're making it sound like atheists are attacking people because of their religion. \n\n>  it's only in modern times that governments have started stepping up and trying to enforce the freedom to worship.\n\nExactly. Only modern, secular governments have enforced freedom of worship. \n\n> Are you thinking that we've just outgrown that phase or something?\n\nNot really, though I sort of wish we would. I outgrew my belief in Santa Claus when I was eight and am none the worse for it. What I want for now is legal freedom to worship whatever and legal freedom to criticize whatever, including worship.\n\n> I understand that you want the right to be able to criticize religion, but it's possible to take that criticism to such a level that it promotes actions that are harmful to people.\n\nAgreed. Though I'd only say it "promotes" actions that are harmful to people if they're a direct call for actions to harm. Otherwise the blame is on the listener. "Kill all Muslims" counts. "Islam is a garbage religion" does not. \n\n> And I think that cases like this thread where you try to dispel the idea that any Muslim could be progressive and tolerant, counts as that.\n\nNot all Muslims want to kill gays; Islam does. Progressive Muslims are ignoring the glaring problems with their religion. That's mostly a good thing, though it does make extremism hard to wipe out. I'd imagine the gays who have been thrown off roofs would have a thing or two to say about this picture if they were still alive. \n\nI wonder what has caused more harm throughout history, Islam or Islamophobia? I'd bet on the former as long as we're not counting Muslim on Muslim violence, which we shouldn't. \n\nWho is a religious critic you find agreeable? I find belief in magic a harmful belief in and of itself; I'm pretty sure Sam Harris concurs.  
Me too: seems like more trouble than it's worth. Though I'm too realistic to think that will just happen. 
Escorts exist. 
Good! 7.5 billion is plenty!
Some people are really passionate about destroying the environment. 
ITT Americans have the same plan they would clothed: guns. 
We like to blame the "organized" religions. The "unorganized" ones would impose their wills if they could. 
Elizabeth Warren is easily in the top-five of the White House's shit-list.  I must have heard her name 100 times during the election. Jeff Merkley never came up.
It certainly LOOKS like a CZ... 
Not talking about psychology. Psychology is hard enough for what it's studying. 
1.5" for sure unless you know your holster clip will fit bigger. I got a 1.5" belt and my holster clip fits it perfectly. Any bigger and it wouldn't clip. Also that's about how big most pant loops are. 
There's a giant ocean there. It's kind of hard to do it otherwise. \n\nIt would be like worrying about illegal Mexican immigration as a British person.
"My preconceived notion is correct" isn't a great hypothesis, especially when riddled with insults, inflammatory rhetoric, and unnecessary agents. That's my current impression of modern gender studies science.
No more religion: I'm on board.
The kind who doesn't make O-6.
> So bake sales are a threat to human rights?\n\nI meant we don't always see the harm religion can do during times of peace and stability. It's still a tinderbox.\n\n> Seriously though, you keep flip-flopping on whether you're fine with people being religious as long as they do good things, or you think that any form of faith is a problem.\n\nI'll be more clear; I think that any form of faith (belief without evidence) is a potential problem.\n\n> You can't decide if you judge people as individuals or if you prejudge them based on statistics.\n\nI try to judge people as individuals, but nobody's perfect. **I don't consider the idea that religious people believe in magic without evidence to be "prejudice."** Do you? I think this is our main sticking point. To me, that's just what the word, "religion" means.\n\n> But lots of small thoughts and ideas can add up to become bigger things.\n\nPeople have this weird idea that Hitler started with violent words that eventually became violent action. His movement was verbally AND physically violent from the beginning. That's why he was imprisoned when he was writing *Mein Kampf*.\n\n> There's no single event that can be blamed for the Holocaust\n\n2,000 years of Christian anti-Jewish sentiment didn't help.\n\n> who gets credit for women getting the right to vote.\n\n2,000 years of Christian anti-woman sentiment didn't help.\n\n> These things happen because of changes in public attitude.\n\nAKA becoming more secular and relying less on religion as a source of morality.
You can't, which is why gender studies is a "soft" science, if a "science" at all. You can't always get cells or mice to behave consistently, which is one reason why biochemistry is softer science than physics. It's not that biochemistry is "worse," it's just softer by nature. Psychology is even softer because of what it studies. But my impression is that gender studies is softer not just because of what it studies, but also because of who studies it. \n\nI'm a biochemistry PhD while we're measuring degrees.
The lifestyle changes between kids one and two don't even compare to the changes going from no kids to kid one. 
He doesn't seem very knowledgeable about the Second Amendment. When the question came up during the debates, he could have REAMED Hillary. But it was clear he didn't know enough about the issue to argue it. Still, he's mostly said that he's in favor of the Second, however vaguely. \n\nStop and Frisk and No Fly-No Buy are Fourth Amendment issues, not a Second Amendment issues. The guns are a detail, not the point. \nSupporting the AWB is dumb though and clearly a Second Amendment issue. Still, that was a hell of a long time ago. 
> They all have the same end game.\n\nI'd totally agree with that. Both Hillary and Obama would probably flip a switch to take all civilian guns away if they could. But I don't think Obama would be rubbing one out while he pressed it like she would be. 
You've got that backwards. Male humans, on average, have [better hand-eye coordination](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8337069) than female humans.
I wonder what would have happened if Germany had been right next to a country called "Jewico." Would they have just deported them there or still killed them?
I'm not sure I'm right; I just probably am. I'm not sure unicorns don't exist either. Belief in unicorns would be pretty harmless, though still stupid. Belief in this particular ancient deity of the Mediterranean has proven truly destructive. Being wrong about gods has certainly been poisonous to homosexuals, see Alan Turing. \n\nI know it's convenient to think of atheism as a religion, but it really doesn't make any sense. People who are wrong about the world aren't damned, they're just wrong. Sometimes being wrong doesn't affect anything, often it does. It's not that big a deal most of the time. But if I see a picture that claims Islam isn't a problem for homosexuals and I feel like commenting, I will.
Won't somebody think of the CHILDREN!?!?!
So all racism and xenophobia is interchangeable? These people are able to get all their racist kicks in by not liking one religion?
Anything that gets you arrested one day but not arrested the next, yeah. 
The double standards make them money.
Pretty much how I feel about Nazi arm bands. I don't like what they represent, but I'd consider wearing one to be protected speech. 
More seriously, this is just my casual meta-analysis of the fields. I read some gender studies papers and wonder how in the world they got through peer review without thinking of things like controls, sampling methods, or the null-hypothesis.\n\nI see those problems less often in psychology. 
>  I think it's highly improbable that there are no atheist homophobes.\n\nAgreed. I'm sure there are atheists who believe that homosexuals should be thrown off of roofs, that global warming is a hoax, or that women should not be allowed to have abortions even when their life is in danger or they've become pregnant through rape. There are 7.5 billion people on the planet and plenty of them are atheists, so there must be some. I just don't know of any.\n\n> Not everyone who disbelieves in God is flawless.\n\nFor sure.\n\n> Religions need to abandon practices that are harmful to society.\n\nReligion said that homosexuality and abortion are harmful to society. How do we know religion is wrong and we're right?\n\n>  Not cease to exist entirely.\n\nWhy not?\n\n> It's just another extension of a negative cultural trend that started with religion and has spread into secular society\n\nI'm just going to Control+C, "false equivalency."

> They both unreasonably restrict 2A rights without due process.\n\nYou don't have a right to own a firearm if you're a felon, or carry one if unlicensed in an area that requires licensing. You don't have a right to carry marijuana most places either. You do have a right to not have your pockets searched for either for no reason, which is a Fourth Amendment issue. \n\nThe gun is a detail, not the point. They give the gun back to people who are licensed after their illegal search. \n\nFor No Fly, No Buy, background checks are supposed to check something, right? They check your criminal history, mental health status, and if you have certain disqualifying debts. Some people think that being on the No Fly list should be another factor; we don't. We've focused in on guns, but this is still more of a Fourth Amendment issue. It could be anything else, like fertilizer, electronic parts, or prescription drugs. 
Not believing in magic is more than a "tweak." \n\nIt's a monumental difference.\n\nAgain, check the scoreboard. 
Part-time work sounds shitty. 
You wouldn't shoot a mugger if you wouldn't carry a gun. "Couldn't" works here too just as well. 
I think it's funny when Americans think they know what Muslim immigration is like in Europe. \n\nIt would be like a guy from the Netherlands talking about Mexican immigration. Mexican people who immigrate to the Netherlands are not representative of those who immigrate to the United States. There's a giant ocean between the continents that serves as an automatic class-barrier and means that most immigrants have to go through customs of some sort. Boat/plane tickets aren't as cheap as walking!
As always, religion is the culprit. We don't need to import more. We already have too much. 
> you believe that at any moment their beliefs will make them do something irrational and dangerous.\n\nIrrational? Maybe. Dangerous? Depends. Not letting your child read "Harry Potter" is pretty irrational. Most of the religious people I know aren't even that level of religious. Believing in an ancient deity of the Mediterranean alone is pretty irrational though. If a holy war broke out, most religious people would probably just opt out. Most people don't take religion very seriously anymore. \n\nThis is making me want to reread *Letter to a Christian Nation*! 
Damn... I should try going OC to my local donut shop.
> The Holocaust maybe? Any number of "Holy Wars" over the centuries? Burning pagans at the stake?\n\nWere those committed by atheists? I'm not moving the goal posts here. I'm looking for anything with utterly anti-religious motivations, not one religion vs another. If atheistic sentiments are just as dangerous as religious ones, they should be easy to find. 
> How much worse can one more baby be?\n\nAssuming she's not got three more cooking. \n\n> You have a good life, a good economy, a great family who is loving and take care of each other - **why not welcome another member into your family**?\n\nThere are already 7.5 billion people on earth. 
Flying a kite is easy. 
> What part of being a citizen makes someone **more valid of a human being** and **more entitled to American opportunities and freedom**?\n\nJust the second one, not the first one. 
We find lots of remains of other human species in the trash heaps of ancient homo sapiens settlements. We not only took over their habitats, we ate them. \n\nAlso, at what point does someone get to call "dibs!" on ancient lands? You don't really "immigrate" to a place that's not a nation-state, you just go there. Then you fight wars to defend your territory from other nation-states until they get tired of fighting you and accept that you're also a nation-state. 
A powerful Democrat who was very much in the spotlight during this election.
Yikes, upset about your choice of degree? 
> The idea that someone of a particular religion is dangerous or untrustworthy because of their beliefs is not an inherently religious sentiment.\n\nI don't think that of all religious people. I just think religion is dumb.\n\nHitler was a German Catholic who strongly referenced God and faith in his calls to exterminate the Jewish people. Nationalism was not sufficient; religion was required. And the loudest calls for nationalism were based on the German people's perceived superiority in the eyes of God. \n\n> Don't point it at anything unless you actually intend to destroy that thing.\n\nI would destroy religion if I could do it without physically hurting people. 
I looked pretty carefully just now and couldn't find a single example of a .50 cal being *used* in an American crime. Sometimes the .50 cal *is* the crime, such as when it's possessed by a felon. \n\nThis (totally unbiased) [briefing](http://www.gao.gov/assets/90/88915.pdf) has some info.
Go after the magical thinking first. The culture problems are derived from superstition. 
Psychology, for sure. It's soft compared to biochemistry (which is soft compared to physics) but rock-hard compared to current gender studies science. Economics is a funny one because it has tremendous explanatory power, but little predictive power.\n\nUseful isn't always that subjective. If Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is more effective than previous therapies at treating depression, we're probably onto something in psychology research. But utility is just one aspect of "truth value." It's best to also have the rest of those aspects I listed, which psychology usually does.
I was climbing and climbing slowly all season. In the last few days, I've steadily fallen 500 SR...

> Tolerance, equal rights and diversity\n\nThe antithesis of religion.\n\n>  You can't cut yourself off from criticism or ignore the historical horrors of anti-religious bigotry\n\nWhat anti-religious bigotry was big enough to be called a "horror?"\n\n> your certainty in your own correctness is no different than anyone's certainty in their God.\n\nControl+V
Totally, there are four basic categories.\n\nPeople who know what they're in for that enjoy it.\n\nPeople who know what they're in for that don't enjoy it\n\nPeople who don't know what they're in for that enjoy it.\n\nPeople who don't know what they're in for that don't enjoy it. \n\nSociety likes to act as though only category #1 exists. Some parents keep having kids after their first, some parents kill themselves because of the stress. It's a mixed bag. 
Predictive power, utility, explanatory power, and hypothesis-driven research aren't tropes, they're fundamental aspects of good science. Quantification is another good way to help know whether what you're saying is true, but it's not always easy to do.\n\nI don't know as much about psychology or gender studies as I do about biochemistry. But it's clear that in terms of how hard vs soft a science is, it goes something like:\n\n\nPhysics\n\n...\n\nChemistry\n\n... \n\nBiochemistry\n\n...\n\n...\n\nPsychology\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nGender studies.
And we probably shouldn't take firearm advice from the person who inspired the phrase, "Dead as Dillinger."
I like this saying well enough and I've repeated it myself... But we really need a negative control here, or to show that we've tried and failed to find a negative control because it doesn't exist.\n\nWhen we say, "Registration is always a prelude to confiscation" are there LITERALLY no exceptions? 
> Islam in any form is a threat to human rights\n\nMagical thinking in any form is a potential threat to human rights (including Christianity). Sometimes it's just bake sales and mission trips, sometimes it's demonizing birth control or lynching homosexuals. And I thought that long before the Alt-Right became a talking point this last couple years. \n\nThis isn't prejudgement, it's just judgement. I read about religion a lot, and try to hear about it from the horse's mouth as often as possible. It's not that often anymore that I hear something new about faith; I haven't this whole thread. \n\n> Your own perceived superiority in the eyes of Rationality makes you vulnerable to being leveraged in the same way German Catholics were.\n\nThat's a stretch. Making fun of religion on the internet is going to become gas chambers? \n\n> If someone claims that moderate Muslims are fake news\n\nModerate Muslims aren't fake news. Plenty of "Muslims" don't pray every day, don't fast for Ramadan, and will sleep around, eat pork and drink a bit, which is fine when done responsibly. The polls on Muslim sentiments about homosexuals, women, science, and other religions aren't great. But statistics like that don't tell you what any one individual Muslim thinks. 
> As women get older they are increasingly likely release multiple eggs in a periad which increases chances of twins.\n\nIt's referred to as a "Going out of business sale."
> You can criticize people for their "belief in magic" if you really find the idea that dangerous, but I think that your ideology has just as much potential to harm people.\n\nWe'll just have to check the scoreboard on that one. 
That's why I liked this one scene in Netflix's Daredevil where the big bad guy thanks Barret for doing a job even though the results were less than ideal, gives him an envelope of cash, and then Barret just leaves. If that's not how it works 90% of the time, there would be no organized crime!
There are such delicious parallels between the gun argument and the birth control/abortion argument.\n\nWhy would you need a suppressor (birth control)? You already have ear plugs (condoms)!\n\nWhat's the big deal if guns (abortions) are restricted in your state? Just move to the next state!\n\nTons of others too. 
> Quality over quantity.\n\nThat's a tad racist. Population control should be worldwide. It would have to be to have any real impact. 
Way too much baggage. Though that's what I said about Hilary and the DNC still decided on her. 
Well I had a Nerf gun fight with my girlfriend last night so I'm an expert on this. Even the threat of getting hit in the face with a foam dart was enough to make me start point-shooting. I'd imagine that the adrenaline of a lethal encounter would make lining up those three dots damn near impossible. It always comes down to muscle memory, so make sure to practice fast, close-range point shooting as a part of your training regimen!
Like Republicans thinking that a woman's body can prevent pregnancy after rape!\n\n
People on the right have a begrudging respect for Bernie Sanders. Not the case with Elizabeth Warren as far as I've seen. And if you read what conservatives are reading, you'd see that she's mentioned negatively every day. Whether or not that's fair, that's baggage. \n\nSanders also doesn't browbeat people the way Warren does. She's good at preaching to the choir. 
Unless you're living in Sub-Saharan Africa, you are an immigrant or descendant of immigrants. \n\nHell, let's say that unless you're living in the ocean, you are an immigrant or descendant of immigrants.

My problem with marriage is that it holds a monopoly on legitimizing romantic pairings. I wish there were a competitor, like Apple to Windows. That way, if marriage became too problematic, people would just use the alternative until marriage changed. 
What are the tanks and jets going to do? Search people's houses for AR-15s?
Immigration itself is a modern notion.\n\n"Thriving" isn't a defense against being invaded. Life isn't fair; I'd never claim it is. 
> It sounds like Harris believes that even when a Christian has an open mind and supports civil rights and is in all respects a good person, they're still not good enough because they haven't been converted to the right way of thinking.\n\nIt's usually good enough. The issue, again, is that there would be no Westoboro Baptist without Methodists. The belief that "faith" is a good thing makes people ignore the root cause of Westboro's hate: magical thinking.\n\n>  It's the same thing you hear from Christians who think that even the most moral atheist still needs to accept Jesus or else they're damned, but at least they've got the concept of hell to back it up. You've got the concept of... what exactly? What happens when a good person believes in God that suddenly makes you think they're a menace to society? At that point, it's no different than treating a black person like an inferior. It has nothing to do with their actual character, only the fact that they're in a different "tribe" than you.\n\nThis is all just so fallacious I don't know where to start...
Diminishing returns: 7.5 billion is plenty. 
Meh, then they did the right thing for the wrong reasons. Too many humans on the planet as it is. 
If there's a police discount, there should definitely be a firefighter discount!
I don't think of religion as a "good thing" worthy of respect (tolerance yes, respect no). I see Islam as an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization with overtones of Arab racial superiority and anti-semitism.\n\nFascist, basically. But I still don't want exceptions to the rule of free speech, fascist or otherwise. 
Listening is critical. I hear way too often that pro-lifers just want to control women's bodies. Maybe, but they also literally believe that an ancient deity of the Mediterranean is real and hates abortion. That seems like an important detail. \n\n“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” 
I'm glad the Catholic Church has [woken up a bit](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/pope-francis-calls-on-christians-to-embrace-green-agenda). Hopefully it's not too-little, too-late. The next generation of children should have an environment to enjoy!
If men were the ones who had abortions, then their entire bodies would revolve around the monumental task of reproduction. Human women would probably be less specialized, ready to hunt and fight other animals and other humans. That would lead to a society dominated by women (might is right in early societies) who don't care about abortion, and we'd be right back here where we started. \n\nIf men were the ones who had to get abortions, they'd be women.

You should read about the [Harvey's Wagon Wheel Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey%27s_Resort_Hotel_bombing) and the bomb the guy made.  According to the FBI, they still think it would be impossible to disarm.  From a purely engineering standpoint, the thing is freaking complex and impressive.  \n\nThere were no less than 8 independent trigger systems, each capable of causing an explosion:\n\n**Double-walled box triggers:** Both the top and bottom box were lined with rubber. A layer of aluminum foil was placed on top of the rubber, followed by another rubber layer. This deadly layer cake created a double-walled box. The foil and the box sides were wired to the battery and the detonators. Any attempt to drill the box would cause the foil to come into contact with the box, completing the circuit and triggering the bomb.\n\n**Float trigger:** A standard toilet bowl float was placed in the top box. Rather than shut off a water valve as it would in it’s normal duty, this float closed a switch. If the bomb squad attempted to fill the device with foam or water, the float would hit the switch, causing the bomb to explode.\n\n**Tilt trigger:** A plastic pipe was lined with tin foil. A metal contact hung inside the pipe. Any tilt, shaking or jostling of the bomb would cause the metal contact to touch foil, once again triggering the bomb. This was the only circuit which could be disabled via the front panel switches.\n\n**Edge foil trigger:** The joint between the top and bottom boxes was lined with foil on both sides. If the bomb squad used a metal tool like a crowbar to attempt to pry the bomb apart, it would complete the circuit.\n\n**Lid triggers:** The lids of each were secured by plunger switches. Any attempt to remove the lid from either box would cause the bomb to detonate.\n\n**Screw triggers:** The screws on the boxes were also booby trapped. They were connected to spring loaded switches such that unscrewing them would cause the switches to close. This would complete the circuit and detonate the bomb.\n\n**Front panel switches:** 28 switches. Some were dummies while some disabled the tilt trigger, allowing the bomb to be moved. Others completed the circuit when flipped, detonating the bomb on contact.\n\n**Timer trigger:** An electro-mechanical sprinkler timer was the final detonator circuit. The delay could be set anywhere from 45 minutes to 8 days. No one knows how long it was actually set for.\n\nhttp://hackaday.com/2015/09/21/this-is-what-a-real-bomb-looks-like/

If you eat a lot of frozen pizza you should really invest in a [Pizza Stone](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/8dc675a8-87ee-4f62-97a1-dde5801421b3.jpg._CB328012239_.jpg). It's just a flat ceramic pan you out directly in the oven while you preheat, then place the frozen pizza directly onto the stone once it's reached temp. Makes a world of difference in thoroughly cooking the pizza and having a nice crispy pizza, plus they are pretty cheap. 
Pretty cool.  Did you have to remove the primers from the shell casings or just let it melt into slag?

Started smoking cigarettes.  I've been a smoker now for almost twenty years and it's been really difficult trying to quit.  Now that vapor technology has improved, I've given it a shot.  But seriously, don't take up smoking.  It's a shitty habit that's extremely hard to quit.
Had a friend do this recently at 1 am on a monday.  He's unemployed, so this wouldn't be too far out of normal for him, but we hadn't talked in over a year.\n\nTurns out he was really having a bad time.  His texts didn't reflect that and he tried to play it off as less of a cry for help, but it was his "last attempt" at reaching out for support (without actually asking for it).  I didn't know at the time (that he was anything other then a little sad), but talked to him all night cause I could feel something was up and kept him positive until the next day when we could hang out and catch up.  \n\nThe next day he told me i was his "last call before he pulled the trigger"...\n\nSIDE NOTE: I've never been so mad at a person.  Don't ever think that people don't care about you, because we FUCKIN DO (even if we are busy sometimes).  Get HELP.  CALL FRIENDS.  WE ARE FUCKIN THERE FOR YOU.\n\nThankfully he's fine now, but it really made me try to become aware of my friends mental problems\n\nJust cause YOU're mentally fine right now, doesn't mean the death of a friend wont fuck you up.  Proper mental health also helps when all those around you are safe as well.  \n\nGood Post OP

So this is my Granddad's Mini-14, which I was given a couple of years ago. The story about "use in anger" comes from the mid 60's. My granddad was an avid sailor living in south Florida. One of his friends was traveling to the Bahamas, so he loaned them the rifle. Apparently they were followed out from the Bahamian dock by a fishing boat for a day and a half until they were far out into open water. These "fishermen" still had not laid lines or done any actual fishing, just following them at a distance. Once they were in open water the "fishing boat" started closing distance quickly and my grandad's friend, whom he had loaned the Mini-14, grabbed the rifle and popped a couple rounds into the water. Immediately the "fishing boat" turned around and they never saw it again. \n\nEDIT: Prob the 70's, but I still do t doubt the story too much. Grandad was a WWII and Korea Vet that didn't speak too much and never said anything he couldn't back up. Straight up "Gran Torino" granddad.

My Summit+ barely provides any vapor even at the highest temp setting and it's really hard to draw from. I'm grinding it pretty fine through a pocket sharpstone and just haven't gotten the results I wanted. I'll continue using the summit for hiking/snowboarding.   The water/shock resistance was the main point that sold me on the Summit+ initially. \n\nI'm just looking for something with more output, that I could also hook up to a bubbler. Still combust mostly and want to switch that to vapor only eventually, but the Summit+ just isn't the right tool for that (at least for me)\n\nEDIT: don't get me wrong, the Summit+ "works" just not for what I want out of a daily use vaporizer. For me it seems more like a novelty. 
I've only reacted when my roommate that had long hair his entire life completely shaved his head out of the blue and that was only cause it took me a second to recognize him.

10th grade field trip to Arlington Cemetery to watch the changing of the guard at the Grave of the Unknown Soldier and one of my classmates wasn't paying attention and was chatting to another student.  I poked him in the back and told him to shut the fuck up and have some respect.  That's when I realized our teacher was standing directly behind me about to tell the kid something similar.  The teacher just glared at me with a raised eyebrow, but had the faintest twist of a smirk on his face.  I was expecting to get in trouble after the ceremony for swearing, but he just rounded everyone up to get back on the bus and didn't speak of it.

I was at our local Pepsi bottling plant for the "global premier" of Crystal Pepsi.  They had music, food and door prizes (won a sweet RC truck).  The culmination of the evening was passing out plastic champagne flutes filled with Cystal Pepsi, and a countdown until everyone could try at the same moment.  They had a live stream on a Jumbotron of all the other bottling plants doing the same.\n\nThen the countdown finally hit zero and everyone took their first sip... and groaned.  Basically everyone at our plant and everyone being live broadcast from the other plants thought it was disgusting.

Let go of the trigger and it chambers the next round and is ready to fire again in semi automatic mode.  By pressing in the charging handle knob, the bolt locks shut into single shot mode, allowing you to fire .22 shorts.  It's a very interesting action and probably my most fun plinker.

>  Like any cop would be mad at a dude who chose to walk instead of drive.\n\nI drove to a party I hadn't really planned on attending which was about five blocks from my house, cause my friend asked me to pickup some pizza.  As soon as I arrived my buddy showed me the bottle of scotch he had brought and I abandoned any hope of skipping the party and proceeded to get pleasantly inebriated.  This wasn't a "frat" type party, just a bunch of friends drinking good scotch and playing video games a few weeks before college classes started.\n\nCut to a few hours later and I'm really not feeling well, so I excuse myself and start to walk home.  When I'm literally directly across the street from my apartment a cop pulls up next to me and flashes his lights.  He asks what I'm doing out this late and if I've been drinking.  I replied honestly that I had had a little too much to drink and was just trying to get to my apartment to eat some food and pass out.  \n\nAt this point I provided the officer with my ID (showing I was 22) and my keys (it was move-in weekend for most of the off-campus apartments and my keys still had the address tag on them).  I also told the officer I had driven to my friends house to play video games and once I decided to drink, I left my car parked on the street and decided I would be walking home that night.  The cop agreed that was a good idea, then asked which car I had driven and if I wouldn't mind pointing it out to him.  I hopped into the back of his squad car of my own free will and he drives me back to the party. Hindsight tells me this was to check and see if he could bust any of my friends, but everyone was inside and not being noisy.  When we get to my car we both get out of the squad car and he asks me to make sure my car locked (I guess to test if it was really my car) and I hit the key fob (lights flash/car beeps).  He also might have been seeing if I'd be dumb enough to actually try to drive the thing home, but I instead asked him if he'd give me a ride back to my apartment or if I was good to just walk back.  At this point he asks me if I have any weapons on me or anything he should know about, then asks me to put my hands behind my back...  I'm confused, but comply.  After I'm in cuffs he explains to me that although it was responsible to walk instead of driving, he was still booking me for drunk in public.  I was in complete shock and asked him what I was supposed to do in a situation like this.  This was a small town college that literally had no taxi services and I was five blocks away in a residential section that caters entirely to the student population.  \n\nHe had no advice, just that I would have been in a lot more trouble if I had driven...  
Pre-order Choas Titan full length rail for my Saiga 12 shotgun.  It was expensive and it turned a handy semi auto shotty into a heavy, huge... thing... that barely resembled the Kalash design it was based off of.  Worst part was it didn't even include the non-standard (searched all over town) bolts to mate the upper and lower rail sections.  After enough bitching, Chaos did eventually send out the bolts but by that time I had given up on that unneeded weight. Still have the lower tri-rail portion on the gun until I can find a decent replacement.

In short, conservatives believe in power, nationalism, and American supremacy, while liberals are more interested in the democratic ideals of the nation, and spreading those throughout the world in the interest of peace and global human rights. Bush II was basically the first Republican president to try to spread democracy abroad (though I would argue that was a thinly veiled excuse to conduct an imperialist war).

TIL! Thanks for the info. I just know as a DC resident, when a big crop of out of towners or tourists comes through, it all looks a lot different. Granted, I'm around my age group more often than the whole population of the city. 
If at all possible prepare a spike pit under any window you plan to have a conversation near.
They're magical because they keep choices in the hands of people, unlike any other solution, which involves either public assistance, prison, or eugenics. Not too far fetched, 100 years ago eugenics through sterilization was the going theory of poverty control.

I think the accent just creates the character in your mind. The humor has essentially nothing to do with his specific ethnic origin, as far as I can tell, other than adding a dimension to the character. It is funny to have a very odd older man who must be somewhat of an outsider have all these opinions that a young American might have, but that part of the humor isn't leveled at the character's origin or cultural identity.\n\nI think it's cool to have a character that's just some weirdo originally from Chinese Cambodia, that just happens to be played by a white man (pretty well from what I understand). I understand your skepticism given that pretty much all use of Asian accents by white comedians is of the punching-down variety, but it doesn't seem harmful to me in this case. Seems more positive than anything. \n\nThough it'd be cool to have more actual diversity on the show to achieve this sort of variety. That part is annoying. 
I'm Ron Burgundy??

That's where people were being detained by the executive branch in violation of a federal court order. Literally customs staff at the airports were causing a constitutional crisis. That's why they're protesting at airports.
Bill here seems like he's having an emotional response and taking this bit seriously. While I agree it's over the line, and his comedy is way, way funnier, it is, in the end, a complaint about comedy, which he seems to be against. \n\nJust playing devil's advocate here. I mean, it's garbage programming, and there's no grounding of "well I assume she was trapped in an abusive relationship to resort to this, otherwise it's monstrous," so it definitely sucks. Im just saying, "no crying foul at comedy" has to be a two-way street, otherwise it's just as much of a double standard. 
We need a better crop of Congresspeople but I think an anti-gerrymandering, anti-Citizens United amendment would get us the amount of churn we're looking for without resorting to term limits. 
Absolves
Constitution covers action by state and local governments, and even in a narrow circumstance interactions between private parties (in the 13th Amendment only). But I made the distinction to avoid the strawman of, "Oh, so what, some guy in Brazil gets (xyz protection)??" Which I've been seeing around. The answer is no, unless he becomes involved in a process under our systems. 
And robbed THAT place, smart
Recommend to any podcast nuts who aren't big into exercise. Honestly for me half the fun of working out is having an excuse to listen to more podcasts.

Quick, what are the world's 10 most populous cities?
American here. You guys do a lot of speculating about the American system before I can have my coffee. 
Yeah he points out logical inconsistencies really well, which sharpens the comedy
Under American property law, subjective conceptions of property by the landholder are irrelevant to legal ownership. Imo, they de facto owned the land. Obviously this disagreement is inherently rhetorical and baseless though. 
Fuck off pal
Yeah agreed monstrous. Just saying, self-examination is a good way not to get too extreme about anything. I love Bill Burr, he's top 5 for me, just felt like creating discussion 
The Justices are predictable not because of their politics, but because they have a long track record of written decisions of law literally called "opinions" in their wake. Some judges come around on certain theories or ways of thinking, and sometimes the world moves under them making them seem more or less left or right, but you know who a judge is at the end of the day. It's beyond politics, it's deeper. It's just how they view the world, read and interpret words, and logic through problems.
I guarantee you every Justice feels this way about Trump. As Constitutional scholars, they must be so disappointed in what's happened to the presidency. Dude does not have a basic understanding of the constitutional order. 
Man you set an incredibly high bar though. It seems like you're saying if someone falls off proportional representation they're enabling sexism. You'll lose a lot of people with that argument. Why not just leave it at, "there are a lot more female and diverse voices out here that are just as funny who should be on more" and drop the list? I found that part incredibly useful. I agree that sexism and racism are imbued in everything we do in America, but I don't see the point in going over the top on your political allies. Let's consensus-build. 
And isn't direct action good and nice, yeah...
In addition, actually talk to anti-abortion people. Half of my family is anti-abortion conservative Catholics, and as left-wing as I am, I see so much rhetoric from liberals that assumes so much that these people don't believe or even know about. My family would look at some of this stuff like you had three heads. \n\nPeople need to be more focused on communicating with the other side and actually building the consensus needed to dominate politically. That's how you get the policies you want. 
Eh idk man if a law is designed to insult and degrade me personally for something innately true about myself, that I could never change or hide even if I wanted to, I gotta think I'm gonna say fuck off and not obey it. \n\nEspecially if no harm comes to anyone from it, and the law serves no purpose but to subjugate me, AND acting out may serve to bring attention to my cause and lead to equality for myself and others. \n\nHonestly "that's no reason to break the law" is an extremely bad strategic take. You would have been of no use at all to the civil rights movement. If you need to break the law to achieve practical ballot access, you do it. 
So obvious. Bannon sowing chaos and taking over. Hope America survives. 
I don't really see how morality is implicated when debating the classification of immigrant vs. settler. I just don't think you can settle inhabited land; it doesn't make sense to me. Like I know what you're talking about when you say "settlers" obviously, but I don't see the distinction as meaningful in the context. They migrated to the American continent, were accepted onto the land by the population that was born there, so they immigrated. Again, in my opinion, and I don't mean to impugn the morality of our nation's founders.
What does regressive left mean?
Or we could engage in a proactive political revolution, which would involve forcibly removing the interest of the wealthy and large organizations with excess capital from their influence on our politics and policy. Once the balance of power shifts there, good ideas actually supported by humanity could get done, and fast. \n\nI don't disagree with your naysaying, it's realistic. People need to stop just commenting "boy that'd be the smart thing to do" and actually show up at political events and say so, or better, run for small local offices.
One man's honest opinion is another man's astroturfed comment. Welcome to modern American polarization.
I'm sorry. We're really trying. It's... a lot. 
Um, source for this!!??!??
On the other hand, the Amendment process is hard enough that it doesn't make sense to require one every time society wants to progress. Secondly, the original intent of the framers is often an illusory goal. There are many cases in which the majority and dissent conduct extensive historical analyses and end up with opposite conclusions about the content of a constitutional clause. 
No, it stands for the proposition that you should care even when you have nothing to hide or nothing to say against the powers at be, because in a moment what you thought didn't require hiding suddenly might, and what you thought was cool to say suddenly leads to a knock on your door. There needs to be a certain amount of individual freedom and liberty in the populous. It's essential.

These people can take this "we need time to figure out a better system" shit and shove it up their ass. As if you can't devise a solution while a system is in motion. Get real. 
"By Infowars and no."
The latter is what she admitted to. It helped the all-white, all-male jury not convict. Not that they needed much help. 
That text isn't a legal document though. The Constitution is, and the general understanding is that most of it applies to all people affected by US action (less so if you're actually a member of an opposing military or "enemy combatant" as it were).

And some cities are still completely dead. Also, since we're imputing desires on people we don't know, I'll posit that as a general rule people hate being unemployed. At least that sits well with my personal experience, I'm not sure what your assumption is based on. 
That example would violate two key parts of the logic I presented. The first being, "something I could never hide or change even if I wanted to." \n\nObviously a lot of these people are behind the eight ball when it comes to glandular and genetic issues. But to say that obesity is an immutable characteristic is a much harder sell than, for instance, the color of one's skin.\n\nSecond of all, such a rule on an airplane serves the legitimate public purpose of keeping the plane level, as well as allowing every person who bought a ticket to access to their seat. In the example of segregated water fountains, the only interest being protected is that of white people not to have to consort with black people. That is not a legitimate interest, according to the Supreme Court, and according to common sense and decency imo.\n\nVery different scenario. 
This thread is making me realize how many times I've been completely laid to waste by Earwolf podcasts over the years.\n\nWhat's wild is that even though I'm remember all-timers like Little Buttonpuss, Analyze Phish at MSG, and some of the tour eps, honestly the last month of CBB and HH have genuinely slayed me. From Wendigabrus to The Chief, I'm just constantly bowled over. It's just making me thankful I guess.
I've come to demand this type of content

Settlers? The migrated to land owned by American Indian tribes. Immigrants, not to America, but to the land that became it. 
Embarrassment is an emotional negative, probably hurts most people in their efforts to move forward. If you're aiming at helping the person, a "good luck" or similar sounds fine!
A lot of people mirror the US Constitution, but we fought damn hard for ours and it's a really good one that we came up with ourselves. That ownership and pride in the document, combined with how damn good it is overall, undergirds our commitment to it. \n\nPeople wanna trash government all the time as being corrupt and not serving our interests, but don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. Our Constitutional order is one of the prime achievements of human history, warts and all, and also you'll be damn sorry to throw it all away just because you don't like one particular thing that's happening. I say that someone who thinks we need serious reform. 
The fact that he knew he would have to make that ridiculous save is... well it's what makes RL RL.

Well there wouldn't be proof of conspiracy either way, we'd just have a factual record to wildly speculate on. As of this moment we don't even know what we're talking about. 
Cruz would nooooot have won. Energy behind Trump is the only reason Republicans won in general, large reason they're so beholden to his whims now. 
It's tough because they make all the products and services we know and love, but they're designed to make as much money as possible within our laws. So it's by the book inhumanly evil behavior, but there are a lot of good people involved, and the rate of innovation under a corporate economy is damn high, which benefits us all. \n\nBut yeah, when we weaken our laws and let entities with a pure profit motive have the rights of human beings (such as "speech"), what we get is a warped nightmare. \n\nAlso the corporate media is a trainwreck. So; MIXED BAG.
Remington 887. Piece of shit. 
And famously too! This guy was all over the news about 10 years ago for his fake videos, how do people forget this stuff?
People did demonstrate, all day..\n\nAlso, the law was enjoined by a state court judge because he saw it as unconstitutional. Ever since Citizens United and the like, cracking down on campaign financing can't be done because it violates free speech. \n\nSo the legislature did repeal it regardless, which is fucked in its own way, but the judicial system is kind of screwing anti-corruption at the source these days.

Found something better and put 1919 in the vault, still there looking pretty.

Early Monday morning, I had been dozing off for about an hour, passively listening to the wind outside, noting that it sounds like a train. My phone sounds off with the one sound I hate in the entire world, a tornado siren. I immediately leap out of bed, not bothering to turn on the light(pretty sure the power was out anyways) and begin frantically searching for the phone. Meanwhile the wind is picking up in intensity, and my frustration is starting to rise as well because I can't find this fucking thing, finally I got pissed and slammed my hand down on the desk; lo and behold I found the fucker. I grabbed it and briefly looked at the screen, saw something about a tornado warning, I figured no biggie.\n\nNow here's my reasoning, I'm in South Florida, tornado watches are pretty rare however tornado warnings are even rarer; and tornados actually touching down are super rare, it only happens every few years. So in my infinite wisdom I figured nothing was gonna happen, but since I'm freaked out by the idea of tornados (don't know why) I decide to do what I normally do during storms in the middle of the night. Throw the blanket over my head and stuff my head underneath the pillows, as soon as I did this I started to read the message on my phone.\n\n"Tornado warn-"\n\nCrash.\n\nMy window is gone, I can now fully appreciate the fury of the storm; fuck this. I abandon my room, somehow I managed to avoid stepping on any glass and closed that fucking door and made my way to where my mom and sister were. As I attempted to open my mom's bedroom door, I was met with unintended resistance. My mom and sister had woken up and were on their way to the safest room in the entire house, incidentally it was my room; so while they were opening the bedroom door I was also opening the door from the other side, so there was a bit of a struggle. At the time I thought they were trying to keep me out, thinking to myself "no you fucking don't!" Not proud of it, but I forced them away from the door and managed to get in.\n\nThey looked confused and told me they were on their way to my room, told them my window was blown out and that the only reasonably safe place they could immediately get to was the closet they were standing next to. Stuffed them in their and covered them with a blanket until the stir was over. Went back to my room after the storm, turns out the wind didn't blow out my window; a couple of roof tiles did.\n\nTldr; tornado touched down and sent some roof tiles flying through my window, had I spent a few more seconds looking for my phone would've died.\n\n~~Photos will be posted later.~~\n\nPhotos are [here!](http://imgur.com/a/aOlb5)

Everything else is utter shit.)\n\nIt is tasteless this way, to me at least... Or you could do the kratom challenge and pour it directly on your tongue and try to get it down before you cough by chasing it, to each their own I guess.

It's probably also worth mentioning that herbal spirits have been developed in certain countries/cultures. The herbs were/are thought to increase drunkenness or lucidity. Assuming it's not a placebo, if something is making you feel more drunk chances are it's doing bad things in your liver and will give you a worse hangover. If it's making you feel more lucid it may be beneficial, also assuming it's not a placebo.
Depends on your dab/bud connection.  I know one guy selling g's of flower for $10 and another guy offloading wax @ $12 a g... So yeah... There's that.\n\nEdit: This is the wacky weed economics that comes from your state legalizing but not having any dispensaries setup.
This doesn't affect USPS correct?
In the rest of the US they have city planners. Boston has an old drunk Irishman throwing darts deciding which direction the one way roads will be going that week.

Can't we just expand it to capitalism im general though? It's still feudalism in the beginning there are just more dukes and counts and clans. Then they eventually "war with each other" and the winner gets even more concentrated wealth. War in the comparison is just trade or commerce on capitalism.
You could.

Mostly, but people also think trace amounts of methanol leftover is also partly to blame. Methanol is created in the fermentation process at different levels depending on what is being fermented. Proper distillation removes almost all of this methanol, so it's kinda silly to say one vodka over another is worse when wine has all the methanol from the original fermentation as it isn't distilled.

Since you can make it on your own, this is pretty weak argument. 
My personal experience fighting insurgents using AK47s and homemade explosives in Iraq would compel me to answer that yes, when fighters have popular support and the initiative to pick and chose their attacks, they do stand a chance.  Furthermore, what I find illogical is the fatalism that pervades people who make your argument. Even if you don't think you have a good chance, why would you prefer to ensure you have no chance by giving up modern weapons?

If you're going to make gun control advocacy posts, then you should go to a gun control advocacy subreddit. This is a pro-gun sub. If we can agree on anything, it's that the right to own a firearm shouldn't be reserved for elites. You posting a vapid, hollow talking point that appeals to anti-gun outrage doesn't add to the discussion. \n\n>"Gun crime is more prevalent in the US than in other rich countries"\n\n\nNo fucking shit, we have more privately owned guns than any other "rich" country by far, but smart people understand two conditions: \n\n* Trying to remove guns doesn't end crime, but it leaves populations vulnerable\n\n* Removing guns in the US will only affect a those who abide by the law and turn them in.\n\nThe framers of the constitution made a deal with their new compatriots: *To back up our promise to be just, we'll leave you with the means to resist.*  That freedom comes with a cost, we get it. We also know there are far better ways to combat violence, than just combatting gun violence. \n\n\n> but I guess according to you, people should probaly start worrying about the heat death of the universe, that'll result in more deaths than even cancer!\n\n\nAlso, fuck off with this straw man bullshit.\n\n\n

Any car with bluetooth already has a mic and software integration.  
here's a few points that might help clear it up. Take the text:\n\n>A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. \n\nFirst, the "people", in the rest of the bill of rights, are interpreted individually, not collectively, so it's inconsistent to apply that to the 2nd, without supporting documentation. As the *Heller* decision illuminates, the supporting documentation of the time was for individual ownership. \n\nAlso, look at the text of the amendment again and ask yourself two things:\n\n* What is to be well regulated?\n\n* and what shall not be infringed? \n\nEven if we ignore the vernacular use of "well regulated" as closer to "well functioning", it's still the militia that is to be regulated, while the right of the people to keep and bear arms is not to be infringed.  \n\nAnother way to think about it is to rephrase a modern sentence in the same way: \n\nA healthy and capable workforce being necessary to the production and goods and services, the right of the people to posses and consume food shall not be infringed. The first clause is the justification for the second. \n\nOther interpretations are motivated reasoning. \n

McMaster was my Regimental Commander with 3rd ACR in Tal Afar. He also promoted me to CW2. To say that our devotion was cult-like would not be an overstatement. He was everything you could want in a senior leader. He fired non-performers, took care of soldiers, and made sure everyone knew where they fit into the plans. I was a replacement to my Squadron in the fall of 2005. He and CSM Burns personally greeted us on the pax ramp. At the time I didn't know how rare that was. \n\nWhen we got back to Ft. Carson he threw a giant party with free beer and bands in one of the hangers at our airfield.

We had at least one vocal fudd type like that show up in here when we grew quickly after the election.

Cool, I didn't think you were arguing against the AR, but you asked for a response, so I obliged. As a father with a job and a stable life, the last thing I want is to arm up and fight, and I'm really a centrist moderate, politically, but the gun debate is so fascinating because otherwise well reasoned and rational people have a hard time separating their desires for peace from the reality that the world is not so stable and safe. Trump's ascension has opened some people's eyes to this. For me it spending a lot time in Iraq and seeing modern, educated people trying to raise families in a failed state. 
> Even criminals are allowed to open carry.\n\nWhat do you mean by this? If you're a convicted felon, you're not allowed to open carry or possess a gun at all. 
I'm dead serious.  I fought in Tal Afar.
>I think you know very little about what I do for our country.\n\nAfter that line I'm wondering if you add to it's national embarrassment.

This is an exceptional pick. McMaster is a soldier's soldier. I feel like we're a little bit better off as a nation with him as the NSA.
If you could just not shift the goalposts you might actually realize that your arguments are weak and should probably be discarded. 
You're missing his cool nickname: we always called him "Heat Round" McMaster. A HEAT round is a high explosive anti-tank round.
Until you understand *why* we have the Second Amendment you'll never understand why we believe modern rifles are important.  \n\nIt is to empower and entrust the average citizen with the means of defense of self and community. \n\n>something designed to kill as many people as quickly as possible.\n \n\nIf this were true, then why do our police also carry them? Modern rifles are not murder machines. They consistently kill less people every year than are killed by bare hands and feet. 
Both could explain the actions to this point, but they are different motivations with different legal ramifications. Basically, one is corruption, the other is treason.

Your anti-gun position and your "BashFash17" username seem to be at odds with each other. How exactly do you expect to resist fascism without modern weapons? I don't think you've really thought this through. \n\n>I am an Army Veteran...\n\nI don't believe you. 
The ability to defend yourself was exactly cited as a fundamental right in the majority opinion in DC vs. Heller. Until you can come up with a better way to defend you, your family, and your property than a gun, owning a gun is a civil right. Is that such a stretch to accept? \n\n>There are plenty of countries that don't allow citizens to hold guns at all. \n\nThere are plenty of countries that will put you to death for leaving your religion, or cain you for littering. America is unique in the developed world. I'm disgusted that so many are willing to trade that for a false sense of security.  \n\n>Almost everyone agrees that citizens should not be allowed to make bombs, even republicans. People just disagree with what level of weapon is reasonable.\n\nExcept we're talking about rifles, not bombs.  The risk/reward/effectiveness for bombs is not really in the discussion for effective self defense. 
Looks great! My first rifle was my WASR. I really think the 7.62 is what all carbines should fire, weather it's 300BO or Soviet special. The fact that it's a carbine should preclude shooting much past 300yds.
>To carry arms as weapons and with reference to their military use, not to wear them about the person as part of the dress.\n\nSince the Army issues holsters this wouldn't survive an ill-conceived challenge against open carry and probably not concealed either because soldiers do occasionally conceal weapons too. 
It's why the determination is arbitrary and blatantly motivated by a desire to subvert the 2nd Amendment. It has no meaning as a standard if it can't be applied evenly. We can apply public risk/reward standards to things like howitzers and sarin gas (from your other comment), but to call a rifle a weapon of war and deem it off limits because it's been used in "war" doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 
and you seem entirely willing to be lied to if it confirms your bias. You people are part of the problem with politics. 
\nNo, we're talking about an infringement of civil liberties at the altar of gun control advocacy, Jfc...\n\nLink to Letter from the ACLU to the House regarding this action (PDF):\n\n>[On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), we urge members of the\nHouse of Representatives to support the resolution disapproving the final rule of the\nSocial Security Administration which implements the National Instant Criminal\nBackground Check System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007.](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLU.pdf)
The text is pretty plain and it's also the interpretation that has been agreed upon the SCOTUS. The only reason you're debating it is because you seem to disagree with the individual right. Are you against other civil rights too? \n
I've heard about Trump's handshake recently. When McMaster promoted me my hands were soaked with sweat.
Right!? I mean there's no possible way a lightly armed insurgency could resist the might of tanks and satellites for over 15 years, say since September of 2001. I'm always amused at how anti-gun people can, on one hand, be aware that the US military has been stymied in Iraq and Afghanistan, but completely ignore that when it suits their arguments against personal ownership of AR15s. 
>The worst part about this is that the media has been sitting around for almost a month, waiting...\n\nIs that worse than the possibility that Trump knew about this for the same past month and only fired Flynn because the information finally leaked? Yates is on record saying the administration knew about this, so if WaPo never breaks the story, are you just totally cool with Flynn, Pence, and CiC lying about Russian contacts?
You're letting your bias against guns cloud your judgement on an obvious phony. Look at all the people pointing out the inaccuracy and inconsistency of his military knowledge.  I'm a vet, a liberal, and a gun owner. This guy is a liar and you don't understand the 2nd Amendment so you're upvoting him. 
> Take note of this guy, NSA :)\n\nWait, I thought liberals loved Snowden and hated the NSA... or do you only want the NSA to spy on people you disagree with politically?  You and Trump have that in common.
> I have had friends that own small businesses trigger these rules for simply making, and depositing, over $10k in revenue. \n\nI have a feeling either you or your friends are on the wrong side of this. Depositing over $10K in cash (because checks have no such gate) will not trip anti money laundering alerts, since you will need to fill out a Currency Transaction Report for that transaction. It's when people attempt to break up deposits into chunks under $10k that the alerts go off. Small businesses do this to avoid the CTR because the IRS also sees CTRs and will expect you to declare all that cash and pay taxes on it. Money  launderers also do this to avoid the CTR raising questions about where all that cash is coming from. \n\n\nI'd bet money your friend was making multiple cash deposits *at or under* $10,000 and got the bank's attention. \n\nMoney laundering detection is part of what I do for a living. 
*"It says people who are unable to deal with their own finances ― requiring a trustee to administer them ― and are unfit because of a disability stemming from a mental problem would have their information sent to the NICS."*\n\nFrom what I understand, the issue is that any mental disability when paired with the social security administration appointing a financial trustee would then trigger a failed background check.  This means that a non violent patient, like someone with a gambling addiction would be denied their second amendment rights.  \n\nIf you're end goal is to simply deny guns to as many people as possible, then you also have to ask yourself, "if someone doesn't want to lose the right to own a gun, will they seek treatment for a mental illness that otherwise wouldn't affect their fitness under this law?"

Right on, these debates get heated.
> They are selling an inherently dangerous weapon,\n\na blatant appeal to emotion to try and imply third party responsibility because you don't like guns.
>School shooters often kill more people than suicide bombers do in the middle east.\n\nYou made that up. Have you ever seen the aftermath of a suicide attack? I have, and you don't have a clue what you're talking about.\n\n\n\n>It is the same risk/effectiveness discussion. Certainly there's nothing wrong with guns that can shoot 6-10 rounds before you reload, because if you want to kill 6 people you could do it with a good knife. But there is a good argument against more powerful weapons.\n\n\nYou're trying to ban a class of weapons that are a blip on the radar of murders in America. AR15s kill less than hands and feet every year. Also, the second most deadly mass shooting in America was committed with two handguns. A mass shooter has the initiative so trying to pretend mag limits do anything is to ignore the fact that planning will overcome any bans. Take Newtown. Lanza could have used a revolver to kill the unarmed teachers and the butcher children with a hatchet. He could have used pipe bombs, as could have James Holmes. These bans are just feel good measures that will do nothing to stop someone bent on being a monster. What they will do is fuck over the average person who finds themselves in an extraordinary situation and hasn't put effort into subverting the law.
It doesn't matter which side you identify with, but if you're going to use the might of the military to nullify the efficacy of civilian owned small arms you have to justify why insurgents forced the US into a withdrawal in one case and a protracted stalemate in the other. 
>TiA has managed to convince Redditors that every gender non-conforming person is some Tumblr radical who pretends to be an animal or whatever.\n\nAlmost everybody is gender non-conforming.

\nI'm a combat vet. I spent a lot of time fighting insurgency.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, but you're doubling down on it. Please stop, you're a civilian who doesn't "like guns" so you think trying to paint people who argue for their efficacy as wannabe terrorists is valuable. It's not, you look like a toddler arguing with adults.  \n\nYou really think you have no room to have your arguments challenged?  What a crock. \n\nUltimately, my "best argument" is that people who'd also just fought an insurgency felt it was best for civilians to retain the means to resist and codified it into the Bill of Rights. Until you can get a 2/3rds majority to change that, you're just trying to subvert that document. \n\nHow would you feel if a circuit court decided you don't have the right to encrypt your communication as that's a military tool? It's the same thing, but people like you and (Jim Jeffries with his stupid "I like guns" bit) don't get that the right to effective self defense is a *civil right*. Liberals all over America are screaming and crying about Fascist Trump and his new Alt-Right brown shirts... who do you think is going to come to your aid if the worst happens? \n\nI'm not wanting to be "an inconsequential terrorist someday" but when rights are lost they can take decades to return and I'd rather not chance it over a weapon that kill less people than hands and feet every year.   \n\n

Smart people are more likely to use birth control.  I'm pretty sure it's a symptom of the problem in society, rather than the problem itself, though.

There are plenty of other identities I would be happy to describe if you want.\n\n>Person B:  \n>You don't actually think that's an answer, do you? But since you kindly offered, I don't suppose you could describe some characteristics of the "bish-friggel?"\n\n>Person A:  \n>Labeling bish- and sor-friggels is difficult because friggel is such a complicated spectrum. For example, I am a cis bish, and I'm more sorly than bishly. There are plenty of bishly bish-identifying people as well. With other friggel identities, it's more clear-cut because the label is more specific.\n\n\nBased off the above conversation, does person A even know what "bish," "sor," or "friggel" mean?
"I saw what happened to my car last night" can mean "Something happened to my car last night, and I saw it" or it can mean "something happened to my car a while ago, and last night I saw it for the first time since then."  He probably should have phrased it differently to avoid confusion, but at this point, it's obvious he meant it the second way and not the first.
>If the law gave me an option of avoiding some of my tax burden, I would probably do that.\n\nIt does.  Anyone is allowed to pay extra income tax.  It's just that no one does.
This is the part where the group of people who complain that gender dysphoria and homosexuality used to be classified as mental illnesses, start saying that having a condition classified as a mental illness should prevent you from buying something, right?
1. Isn't it at least a *little* sexist to say "a man who doesn't have male 'gender expression' is no longer a real man?"\n\n2. Apparently there's "sex," "gender," "gender identity," and "gender expression."  You special snowflakes can't stop digging this hole, can you.\n\n3.  Is there a word to describe a gay guy who's only attracted to bears?  If so, is this sexuality a subset of homosexuality, or is it different?
The root problem is, why is it that as soon as someone is finished with public school, the reaction is "great, now it's time to go to a school that's actually useful!"\n\nAlso, "free higher education" is an oxymoron because "higher" is defined as "what comes after the free stuff."
>Sometimes your opponent suspends rift bolt and in response to the suspend trigger you Mirrorweave everything into Eidolon of the Great Revel.\n\nOK, that's hilarious.  And I thought [[Redirect]]ing Thoughtsieze was my favorite troll move.\n\n
Okay, no, seriously.  He cut off someone's head and ate his eyes.\n\nAccording to him, all his mental illness did was make him think that he had to do it or he'd die, so he's still immoral, unless I'm missing something obvious.
Yeah, the slaves learned English and didn't commit many crimes.
If you care about something dumb like that, she probably dodged a bullet.
I'm not sure why you're constantly spouting off anti-religious stuff.  You know this guy said he cut off someone's head because he thought God wanted him to, right?\n\nIf anything, I would expect the anti-religious response to be "so what if God told him to kill someone, he still shouldn't have done it."  But then again, I'm an atheist over the age of 30, so I'm old-school like that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYEl09nzxls  \nhttps://youtu.be/E3rGev6OZ3w?t=2m10s
Women tend to vote for a bigger more 'motherly' government that costs so much money that people can't afford to have kids.
>What about being transsexual/homosexual/etc generally makes you more likely to go on a shooting spree?\n\nNot much.  That's the point.
You could not have started in a better place. \n
>It also means that you could easily argue masturbation is murder. Or that every time a woman lets herself have a period, it's murder.\n\nJesus fucking Christ.  At least when conservatives are dumb, they're usually aware of it.
I guess I don't understand the point of this.  Doesn't each person at the cemetery already have his/her own tombstone?\n\nThis would only make any sense if there's a policy that forbids women from having tombstones or from being buried at the cemetery, but then a better solution would be to discontinue both this memorial and those policies.  So either way I really don't get the point.
Uhhhh.... it's 25%.
Why are Baubles used?  I remember them being used with Swiftspear, but now there's probably something I'm missing.
Stupid question time:  Have you ever recieved a tax refund check?  If so, did you use it or did you throw it away?
Jesus Christ.  I have a huge ego, and even I can't imagine being so full of myself that I consider myself a "geostrategist."
Okay, no, seriously.  If a movement calls itself "pro-choice," they can't make fun of other movements' names.  People who think people should be allowed to choose whether or not they own guns aren't dumb enough to call themselves "pro-choice."  People who think they should be allowed to choose whether or not they smoke marijuana are smart enough to realize that calling their movement "pro-choice" is dumb.
>It's not "needing a new title", it's just feeling like another word describes them better.\n\n"Star Wars fan" is descriptive, but it isn't a gender.  "Procrastinator" is descriptive, but it isn't a gender.  "Good at cooking" is descriptive, but it isn't a gender.  "Republican" is descriptive, but it isn't a gender.  \n\n>Besides, what gives you the right to police people on how they label themselves?\n\nBecause they want others to label them that way too, and because they're promoting sexism.
The women's memorial is located inside the gender-neutral memorial.\n\nUnless women are excluded from the cemetery, this monument is pointless (and if they are excluded, a better solution would be to get rid of this memorial and make the cemetery gender-neutral, so either way this memorial is dumb).
>You can't say you didn't pay taxes because the law allows it and expect anyone to think that's a reasonable argument.\n\nHave you ever recieved a tax refund check?  If so, I'm assuming you threw it out and didn't use it, right?\n\nOr let's say you use turbotax or whatever, and it says you owe $1,067.83.  How much do you write the check for?

Trump asked the government how much he owed in tax, they told him an amount (I think $0, not sure), and he paid that amount.  If that is a loophole, then your example is a loophole too.
Trump says election might be rigged; media say elections can't be rigged and the winner (probably Hillary) will win fair and square.
Compared to the thread above this, this thread has 33.7% as many points and 9.52x the comments.  Strange...
Yeah.  As opposed to Britain, which practically gave them the death penalty at the time.

>Pansexual is...  not gender related.\n\nSoooooo.... Pansexual doesn't have anything to do with transgender people, meaning it's the same as "bisexual."
>The implication of loophole is "an unintentional omission or obscurity in the law that allows the reduction of tax liability to a point below that intended by the framers of the law."\n\nGreat, then Trump didn't use a loophole.  Glad to see we're in complete 100% agreement.\n\nEDIT: Never mind, I wasn't aware that I was arguing with someone dumb enough to be surprised that some guy on reddit who defends President Trump might actually post on the official Trump forum here.  
Whites are growing tired of "you're evil, you constantly oppress us, you are doing most of the bad stuff in the world, the other bad stuff is done by people who you taught how to do bad stuff, the world would be better if you went extinct" and "by the way, can I please move next door to you?"
> birth control was until recently not included on insurance \n\nTo be fair, for car/life/property/fire/whatever insurance, trying to make insurance cover a choice ("my body my choice") is insurance fraud.
It's a thing that is legal and it lets people pay less taxes.
Um, ok?  Did he also say the sky is blue?

>It's the job of the whole world to help people in need...\n\nIf people spend so much time/effort/money doing this that they can't have kids (which could be evidenced by a birth rate <2/person), they are cucks.  Literally.  Like, from the scientific/evolutionary/biological perspective.
> if you don't want to be carpet bombed or nuked, don't declare war on all your fucking neighbors\n\nDidn't Britain and France declare war on Germany?\n\n
Okay, what event becomes 0.016% less/more likely to happen, then?
It *looks like* you don't know what "gender," "male," and "female" mean.\n\nMind you, I'm not saying your definition is wrong.  I'm saying you don't have definitions in the first place.

You can mention on your dream sheet something like "I'm planning on going AST, and respectfully request to be stationed at an Air Station." (looks like we can't make up our minds if we want to abbreviate that as "AS" or "AIRSTA")\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can inform someone higher up at your first unit that you'd like to go AST and they'll try to transfer you to an Air Station for a bit.  This "higher up" person could be MKC, BM1, or LT, for example.\n\nYour recruiter might have advice on what to do, as well.
That scene where the word "woman" doesn't occur to him is one of the creepiest things I've seen in any movie ever.

Drawing with pencils. A full pencil art loadout looks like this:\n\nKneaded eraser, three bucks. \nFour pencils. 7H, HB, 4B, 7B. Seven bucks total. \nPaper blending stub. Two bucks. \nPencil sharpener. One buck. \nDecent but economical hard bound sketch book with about two hundred pages. Twelve bucks. \nTutorial videos and websites. Free. \nReference images. Free. \n\nSo twenty five dollars and you're set for a ludicrous amount of time. And none of the consumable items cost more than two bucks. \n\nI rounded the prices up in a lot of cases just to be sure. You can probably get the pencils for around 5. \n\nIf you try to buy pencil art beginner packs they'll try to sell you a dizzying array of pencils. But no beginner has ever actually needed to differentiate between an 5B and 6B pencil. They're so similar they may as well be identical to anyone but a pro, and even half the pros laugh at the idea of caring about the difference. \n\nThe exact pencils you need MAY vary depending on how hard you're accustomed to pressing and how dark you like your lines to be. Just FYI. I like light lines and the above work for me. I also lean heavily on the HB for fine lines so I use a six dollar mechanical pencil with lead that's like two bucks for a giant pack. 
Functional literacy is a real bear, ain't it.
Its also probably BS.  They culled their CCW holder crime rate from CCW revocation stats, and every time those are audited it turns out that huge numbers of people who ought to have their CCWs revoked never do.  And interestingly, the audits with which I'm familiar from previous reddit arguments were in Florida, where they draw their figures.\n\nUnfortunately I can't say if the stat is off by enough to change who's higher or lower, but I can definitely say that this study compares \n\n1. The notoriously unreliable rate of CCW revocation, with\n\n2. The notoriously unreliable rate of police officer criminal conviction\n\nSo I don't find its conclusions very credible.
Are you kidding?  What about the whole thing where he says that poor 25 year old teachers are getting seduced by sexually aggressive 13 year olds, and the adults are the real victims?

You can roughly divide illegal immigrants into the following groups that represent the majority of what we deal with when we discuss illegal immigration.\n\n1. Drug traffickers.  Nobody likes these guys.  They don't really set up residence though.  Their whole shtick is going back and forth over the border again and again, so they're pretty much a law enforcement issue.\n\n2. People who come into the country and work undocumented jobs.  The whole reason companies hire undocumented immigrants in the first place is because you can pay them wages that are good in their home country, but terrible here.  Entire farming communities function because of the availability of these workers, and the fact that you can bypass minimum wage by hiring them.  This is completely illegal, but no one ever targets them or the people who hire them in any meaningful way because the companies that hire them are economically important to the regions in which they exist. \n\n3. People who overstay VISAs.  Some of these people have relatively serious jobs. \n\n4. Children who were born in Mexico, then brought to the US when they were infants, and who have since grown up here in the US and have no memory of Mexico. If you were too young to remember entering the country and your parents don't tell you, you can make it to about 16 before it becomes really, really likely that you'll have to do something that requires valid citizenship, and your status becomes clear to you.\n\nEveryone hates group 1.  Group 2 is a problem, but the solution to it is to prosecute the companies that hire them.  Half the time group 3 is a problem, but half the time its more of a paperwork issue and no one wants to target it because its overkill.  And most people feel some degree of empathy for group 4, especially because a lot of people in group 4 are young adults on their way to becoming functional and contributing members of our society, and who will essentially be condemned to homelessness if they're pushed out of an airplane in Mexico and told they live there now.\n\nThat overview provides the basics for how different groups react to illegal immigration.  The left typically favors some sort of clemency and path to citizenship for group 4 as long as they avoid meaningful criminal records (the left generally doesn't care if you get caught smoking pot, but will deport for more serious crimes).  The left also tends to favor a path to citizenship for anyone who is in group 2 or 3 for a really long time on the grounds that such people are effectively part of our community, and prefers to deal with both by going after employers who knowingly enrich themselves via the hiring of illegal immigrants.  And everyone hates group 1.\n\nThe right doesn't really have a position.  They're generally hostile to illegal immigrants in all situations, but they're not willing to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants, and they're rarely willing to stand up and publicly say that group 4 should be deported.  Instead they try to hide behind a "aw shucks, the law is the law, don't look at me" attitude, which is idiotic when you're a politician capable of passing laws.  The right instead tries to deflect onto some fantasy of illegal immigrants sneaking into the country and getting rich on welfare, which pretty much doesn't happen because, aside from some really niche local stuff, government benefits are going to require legal residence.  So the right ends up chasing something that doesn't exist, while occasionally coming down like a hammer on random people in groups 2, 3, and 4, but never any of those groups as a whole or in a concerted way.\n\nTLDR- illegal immigrants mostly aren't a burden on the US if you take out the drug traffickers and just focus on the ones who are earning money and sending it home, UNLESS you consider the fact that they're enabling businesses to function by paying sub standard wages to undocumented workers to be a "burden," but if you think that then you should be focused on the businesses themselves, not the workers.  The money they send home is a trivial drain on the economy, and calling that a drain is like getting upset that someone saves money in a sock.  And the trade deficit with Mexico isn't necessarily a problem at all, that's not how trade deficits work.  A trade deficit just means that we buy more from them than they buy from us, which is unsurprising given that we're rich and have all kinds of money to spend and they're poor as dirt and can't afford any of our stuff.\n\nPS- your "earned" comment really grates.
The constitution CAN'T be taken literally. If literal is the only sense that matters we might as well rip it up. There is no literal meaning of "due process" or "unreasonable search and seizure." Some phrases that might seem to have literal meanings fall apart instantly once we get to an actual dispute: "respecting an establishment of religion," for one. And even seemingly literal phrases fall apart when you really have to dig into them in unexpected ways- Congress created Guantanamo and ordered that it be used. Can the President use his powers as commander in chief to not use it? To close it altogether? To leave it open but pull all the prisoners out of it until it may as well be closed? \n\nThe dominant legal theories on constitutional interpretation are, roughly,\n\n1. Interpret the words of the constitution as they likely would have been interpreted at the time it was passed. Positives: roots the constitutions language in a place and time. Claims legitimacy from connection to the populace who's representatives crafted the constitution. Negatives: often fails to produce a clear result, leaving the judge to full in details from his own politics. \n\n2. Pragmatically full in unclear details in the constitution by reference to how the constitutional principles that the constitution protects are popularly understood, and a healthy respect for precedent written by other judges trying to do the same. Positives: questions have to be answered and this does it. More honest than the first option because judges who claim to do the first thing often can't do not and have to do the second anyway. Derives legitimacy from the assent of the people who choose on an ongoing basis to live under the constitution. Negatives: less rooted in permanence than the first option professes itself to be, though advocates of the second wouldn't agree that the first option actually does what it says on the tin. 
Presumably the reason is an effective legal regime for grenade control?
You didn't call anyone a cuck, and none of your words are misspelled. Obviously you are actually George Soros engaged in a long term false flag operation aimed at discrediting anonymous internet commenters as a class so that secret underground child molestation rings can continue to pass messages via super secret code words on random Reddit posts. \n\nThere can be no other explanation. 
He didn't say that.\n\nAs for what he DID say, he's right.  Conservatives are literally a threat to this country.\n\nTheir primary elected representative right now gave one of the most important positions in the entire government to Bannon, a guy who believes that we're on the cusp of a climactic christianity vs islam battle to the death, and who's eager to get things started.  I don't know how much more they have to do before we stop and think, "wait, this is a serious threat."
I'm willing to forgive him for that one too. \n\nI'm a lawyer. I've worked on politically sensitive cases, though nothing like an actual attorney general. I've never been in the public spotlight, but I've been in situations where, had I said something insensitive and had someone wanted to make a national scandal out of it, they could have. I don't want to make it sound like I was important, because I really wasn't, but I was just involved enough in an issue of popular interest at the time that someone could have made a lot of fuss over any insensitive words on my part. \n\nI'm *pretty* sure I never said anything I wouldn't want to see on the news under headlines like "Lawyer for [household name] mocks [really sympathetic person]." But I'm not 100%. My brain does dark humor on auto pilot. I know I kept an even stronger filter on when in public than when among other lawyers like myself, so it's possible that someone who knows me well could come up with something really awful I've said over the years. Especially if you dress it up a little- sometimes the really sympathetic little old grandma or whoever is actually a horrible human being and you react to that, but when the story is recounted all that context disappears. \n\nBut I'm a lot less forgiving of Sessions' participation in selectively targeting black voters for "voter fraud" investigations based on nothing more than a conviction that if they're black and they're voting there must be something shady going on. I'm not willing to pretend that 1980s Alabama was some magical racism free color blind wonderland and the targeting of African American voters was a racially neutral act premised on some justification that no one can remember anymore. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck I'm operating on the assumption that it's a duck. Sessions could maybe satisfy me by apologizing- the world has changed a lot since the mid 80s and he's a much older man and maybe he's changed- but not by denying. Denying and having the Senate use procedural tricks to prevent people from discussing it is proof that nothing changed. 
That still doesn't work without comparing how long the people in question have been working as police officers at the department where complaints are being counted.
Breitbart is so into the supposed Muslim subjugation of Sweden that it borders on sexually fetishistic. Imagine their headlines and most quotable lines about alleged Muslim subjugation of swedes superimposed as captions on interracial porn, and it makes a lot more sense. 
I am aware that Trump's rhetoric on this has been decent at times. \n\nI am also aware that one of the FIRST THINGS that congressional a Republicans said when he won was that this would not be a priority for them. \n\nAnd I am aware that Trump has since commented on how he recently learned that infrastructure spending isn't really a republican thing, and how he was surprised to find that out. \n\nNow maybe Trump will take on Congressional Republicans and actually win on this issue. If so I'll be amazed, and I'll owe him what credit he's due for accomplishing something difficult and positive. Who knows, maybe conservative hatred of bridge maintenance will be lessened if they think a republican president will get the credit for it. \n\nBut I'm not holding my breath. Trump isn't the only republican in DC, and the way I win so many political bets is simple- I assume that the same people will do the same things they did the last time they were in the same circumstances. And supporting oil pipelines, coal subsidies, and "public/private partnerships" that are effectively just giveaways to campaign donors is what the Republicans did when Bush was in office, and they're still mostly the same people and the same ideological faction. 
I do about 10 fine meals per colonist, and 5 regular. This solves literally all food production/consumption chain priority problems, and a lot of negative events. 
John Doe and Jane Roe are police officers.  John Doe has 90 complaints in the city of Chicago.  Jane Roe has 15.  Your "sound logic" concludes that Jane Roe is the more ethical cop.\n\nBut you don't know how long they've been Chicago cops.  If John Doe has been a Chicago cop for 30 years, and Jane Roe has been one for two, Jane Roe is accumulating more complaints per year than John Doe.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the fact that the best way to avoid complaints is to not have a public-facing job description, and we don't know anything about what they spent their time doing while working as cops.
Well, this was supposed to be less about who's at fault, and more about what we should do as a country.  
Comma usage was NOT the only issue, or even a major issue, in any of those cases.  The Heller ruling interprets the constitution such that the second amendment, uniquely, explains its reasoning in language that is effectively just commentary.  An interpretation that renders the second amendment grammatically and structurally unique makes it an anomaly, and usually interpretations of documents that create anomalies are wrong.  Additionally, one of the classical rules of jurisprudence, known to the drafters of the constitution, is that interpretations of the law that render entire clauses without legal import are strongly disfavored.\n\nI don't think necessarily think that Heller was definitely wrong, but I think it is ridiculous to assert that it was definitely right, especially on grounds of comma usage, when so much militates otherwise... including the traditional means by which laws have been grammatically parsed for centuries.
> Martin physically assaulted someone he perceived to be a threat. But there wasn't legal justification for him to assault Zimmerman.\n\nYou have no way of knowing this.\n\nEasy hypothetical scenario that is 100% consistent with all testimony except that of the man who was on trial for murder- Martin approaches Zimmerman to confront him about stalking him in the dark.  Zimmerman believes Martin to be a thug (that's why he was stalking him) and responds to Martin's approach by putting his hand near his weapon.  Martin, in arms reach, realizes what Zimmerman is doing, and in fear, attacks Zimmerman in hopes of preventing himself from being shot.\n\nA reasonable jury could easily find that 1) Martin had a right under Florida law (which includes stand your ground) to approach Zimmerman, and 2) Martin's fear that the man who was stalking him in the dark and who was carrying a gun and reaching near said gun was a reasonable fear that justified a self defense right.  And if Martin had a valid self defense right created by Zimmerman's actions, Zimmerman did not.\n\nCertainly self defense has been legally justified over less.  In my state it certainly has.\n\nNow I can accept that Zimmerman was acquitted.  Accepting that Martin threw the first punch only provides Zimmerman a self defense right if Martin's punch wasn't justified.  But truly knowing whether that punch was justified is impossible because the only witnesses to that moment in the fight were Zimmerman and Martin, and Martin is dead.  \n\nIts no surprise that this didn't rise to "beyond a reasonable doubt."\n\nBut the reddit conviction that there's no doubt the other way is asinine.  It is trivially easy to contemplate scenarios, consistent with all the available facts and testimony (except that of the accused) in which Zimmerman committed murder.
5 points isn't much, but 40k less debt and no monthly debt payment is huge. \n\nI used to be tangentially involved in a process where lending was underwritten. There are a million ways to do it and I'm sure it's possible for anyone to get screwed over for some stupid reason along the way. \n\nBut very generally, what I usually saw in situations where real underwriting was happening, is that the lender was most interested in 1) what you earned each month, 2) what you spent each month, and 3) whether they thought you could meet loan payments with what was left over. \n\nCredit rating mattered but "seriously, does this guy have enough money to pay the payments on this loan he wants?" was huge, and dropping a monthly student loan payment directly makes more money available for a house payment. \n\nTake all of that with a grain of salt. I wasn't actually an underwriter and there's a lot of ways to do things. And I definitely can't give personalized advice of really any meaningful advice at all online with no real research or personal knowledge of anyone's situation. \n\nBut I would rather have $1000 spare income each month and a 650 credit score, than $700 spare income and a 655. 
Full disclosure- my knowledge of that case comes entirely from reading the Wikipedia article and I therefore reserve the right to change my mind if additional information becomes available. \n\nI disagree with the outcome of Hermesmann. I'm less concerned about the babysitter relationship than I an about the fact that the sexual relationship started at twelve. As I think I said earlier, maturity is a progression. Twelve is really young, and thirteen isn't much better. Had the pregnancy occurred at 14 or 15 or 16 I would probably feel differently. I'm not familiar with most states age of consent laws (age of consent isn't exactly an important issue in my life, this is all academic for me), but in the one or two I know 12 is definitely within the range of heightened punishment, in what I take to be recognition of the differences between 12 year olds and older teens. \n\nI agree with the general critique of child support law- that it is over eager to grab likely looking males and assign child support obligations in order to ensure that at least someone is paying, even if it doesn't seem fair that the particular man in question pay. \n\nThat said, I can't speak to whether the court was actually wrong on the law. Presumably they were applying and citing actual laws passed by the legislature. That's outside of my knowledge. 
Yeah, a "sit in" protest where everyone carries rifles and screeched about a willingness to die rather than be moved while meaningfully hefting said rifles. \n\nBlack Lives Matters is really annoying when they block a highway over some shooting that they don't even know for sure was wrongful or they don't even know for sure isn't being handled properly. \n\nBut they'd be a damn sight more of a problem if they blocked highways while carrying rifles, eyeballing cops, and declaring that they were willing to die rather than get out of the road. Police response would be MASSIVELY different for that, and for good reason. \n\nFFS. The idea that we should think the same way about Occupy Wallstreet and a hypothetical Bizarro Occupy Wallstreet where everybody is armed and talking up their preparedness for a bullet hell showdown with the cops is just ridiculous. 
In addition to what u/redem said, being the primary source of Nato's power gives us leverage that we utilize every day without even thinking about it. When the US prides itself on being the leader of the free world, we're only the "leader" in the sense that other countries are often willing to follow us. And they follow us because the advantages of being our friend are so great. Be America's friend and your businesses get access to our economy and your security forces can borrow our strength. The whole reason we get what we want so often is because other countries want us to keep doing things like providing security guarantees. \n\nThe multi national force that followed us into Iraq only existed because of these forms of "soft power." If Greece had asked the world to do the same thing, no one would have shown up, no matter how righteous their cause.\n\nWe squander this at our peril. A good president ought to cultivate it, since it's the real reason we're the most powerful country in the world. 
My wife likes to do the "here's what your competitor is offering, can you beat it" routine. \n\nEvery time they trick her. We're paying exactly as much now as we always did. Technically our internet speeds get faster each time she calls, because they offer her upgraded service for the same money. But we don't USE the extra speed. She watches netflix sometimes, and I play overwatch sometimes, and our system was already fast enough to do both at once. So the extra speed is irrelevant, and probably costs our provider nothing. 
1. This makes it even more clear that your real plan here is to cut retirees quality of life via a lower benefits threshold (the poverty line) and later retirement, thereby spending less money.  We can do both of those with the existing system of we so choose.\n\n2. The prior system made it about a hundred years before a "shortfall" that is more technical than real.  If that's a problem, then a constant drip of government funding for all the people who manage to live longer than expected is definitely a problem.  If the latter isn't a problem, then I fail to see why the former is.
Then do it. \n\nI'm not kidding. If you genuinely believe that you will be better off poor and with government benefits than middle class without, do it. DO IT. \n\nPeople say this all the time but none of them do it. \n\nUtility subsidy eligibility varies by state. I spot checked a few near me and for income levels under $20,000 for a one person household. \n\nPhone subsidies are similar. \n\nSNAP is slightly lower. \n\nAnd all the tax credits in the world won't do you any good if your income is already low enough that you've zeroed out the income tax portion of your tax bill via other deductions, which WILL happen if your income falls beneath 20k and you're doing your taxes properly for both you and your business. \n\nThose tax deductions and credits are a middle class subsidy, because you don't benefit from them at all until you earn enough to clear all other deductions and credits. \n\nIf you genuinely believe that earning about $18k per year and having free time and a subsidized gas bill is worth it, give it a shot. \n\nI've earned that and F THAT I am not going back. 
It's plausible if you assume he's weaseling on his 35k "taxable" income, and actually has a huge pile of money he's sheltering as deductible. If his real income is like 50k/year, and he's writing off 15k somehow and ignoring it when he runs his percentages, these figures make a lot more sense. \n\nBecause otherwise, you're right. This doesn't make sense. A $3500 property tax bill implies about $175k or more in house, which gives him a monthly mortgage payment of like $1100 or more, and like $350 to live on. \n\nBut if you figure he's hiding another $15k from his post, that's another $1600 to live on. Which still gives him more house than many metrics would recommend, but at least he's a lot closer to the mark. 
The reporter should have asked what he would say to a twenty five year old woman who has been seduced by a thirteen year old boy.  Since apparently Milo thinks that's a real thing.
The vocal, visible, *policy making* people for whom the rest continue to vote. 
IIRC, post 9/11 anti terrorism bills included an intent to spread fear as a qualification for terrorism classification. So shooting up a synagogue because you hate the Jewish would be a hate crime, but shooting up a synagogue because you hate the Jewish and want to spread a message of "be afraid you might get shot too" would be a hate crime and also terrorism. \n\nI remember that conservatives used to hate hate crime legislation on the grounds that it involved enhancing punishment based on a guess about meta level motivations, but love anti terrorism legislation, and the analogy between the two was problematic for them. 
I think I qualified what I said quite carefully and detailed how it supported my similarly qualified agnosticism (an agnosticism that apparently didn't even register to you in spite of me repeating it multiple times), but your response is certainly on par with the mental caliber I anticipated you would demonstrate.  So, cheers, I guess.
The "3000" statistic for terrorism is "since 9/11/2001," which is about fifteen years, not ten.  Its also a little questionable, because 2001 did happen, and low frequency high impact events should probably count... but then 2000 and 1999 and so on also happened so both stopping our count right before and right after 2001 yields screwy results.\n\nYou seem to have confused "kids accidentally killed by guns" with the actually relevant statistic, "people accidentally killed by kids with guns."\n\nGoogling accidental gun deaths yields a little under 600 in 2011, with about 100 being children, and about 50 of those being children under 13.  The article notes that this almost certainly undercounts, because many coroners do not specify whether a shooting was caused by a person's error, and simply classify all human-shooting-human incidents as "homicide."  For example, from one quoted coroner's report: "Homicide: Shot himself with an unsecured handgun."  That case would not have be included in popular statistics on accidental deaths by firearm due to its homicide classification.  \n\nThe article goes on to note that our information on accidental deaths caused by children with firearms is even worse, and no numbers were available at all (at time of publication, the article was from a few years ago, maybe someone has accomplished something on this since then, but probably not since the Republicans have been prohibiting this sort of research by government funded groups or departments for some time).\n\nSo TLDR- it would be foolhardy to conclude that accidental deaths caused by children with firearms exceeds that of deaths caused by terrorism.  But it would also be foolhardy to conclude the opposite.  Further, the best statistics we have regarding accidental firearm deaths of children puts the number at about half of that of terrorism if you use a 15 year window on terrorism, and we know that these statistics undercount accidental firearm deaths of children... but we don't know how much it undercounts.\n\nAnyway.  Thought I'd add some good math to counter the bad math.
He doesn't care and has never heard of her.  This is a far left news site and a single illegal immigrant flapping her gums.
I think OPs reasoning is pretty bad, but I do think it is at least hypothetically possible to envision a situation where the bakery has an argument, and your post connects with it. \n\nThree scenarios. \n\nSometimes the cake is a cake, and has no speech content. \n\nSometimes the cake contains speech content, chosen by the customer, and transcribed by the baker. \n\nSometimes the baker is hired specifically for the purpose of using their expertise at artistic cake design in order to come up with a cake that has speech content that matches the customers desires. \n\nI'm very comfortable requiring bakers to sell off the shelf or otherwise indistinguishable products to anyone who comes in the door. I'm reasonably comfortable requiring them to transcribe whatever they're given onto otherwise standard issue products. Neither of those involve compelling speech from the baker himself. \n\nBut the cake design scenario, in which the baker has to use artistic discretion to come up with the best way to use the medium of cake design to communicate a message of celebration of the marriage, seems meaningfully different. That invokes the bakers own speech rights. \n\nMy own career involves taking people's money and then speaking on their behalf. My situation is a little different because I had to sign over certain rights in order to enter a licensed profession, and I can definitely be compelled to speak on behalf of people I might choose not to speak on behalf of if I were allowed a choice. But even there, there are limits, and I generally will not be compelled to advance political causes I find objectionable. \n\nTLDR- if cake design can be protected speech, and it seems like it ought, that's different from non discrimination in selling a generic product. 
I don't know whether this will change your view or not, but...\n\nThe popular internet theories of sexual consent are kind of nonsense, including how the internet talks about statutory rape. \n\nOn the internet people will stand up and declare that minors can't consent, then pat themselves on the back for opposing rape. \n\nIn real life the law acknowledges that minors CAN consent, but that they aren't as good at it as adults. That's why criminal punishments in most (maybe all but I haven't counted) states increase as the age of the victim goes down. That's why it's not double-rape when two minors have consensual sex. That's why it's still actual rape if a minor rapes someone. \n\nThe actual justification for statutory rape laws has a lot more to do with disparate power and concerns about undue and inappropriate influence than about some bold, unqualified declaration that a minor "can't consent."\n\nYou're concerned about the inconsistency of saying that child support shouldn't be imposed after non consensual parentage, but not applying the same reasoning to statutory rape. Don't be. They're entirely different. And if you want to illustrate how they're different in the easiest way possible, imagine two sixteen year olds having sex on purpose and because they choose to, and then keeping the resulting baby. If we insist that minors "can't consent" in the same way that rape victims "don't consent," what then? We've got two people who didn't consent to sex (after all they literally can't, right?), so can we impose any parental obligations on either? How did we let them choose whether to keep a baby or have an abortion if they're psychologically incapable of choosing to have sex? Are they mentally competent to make such a choice? Shouldn't it be taken away from them and given to someone psychologically able to handle it? \n\nAlternate suggestion- anyone who's ever been a teenager understands that teenagers may be impulsive as may have poorer judgment than an adult, but they can definitely consent or not consent to sex. There are other VERY VALID reasons to prohibit adults from having sex with minors, because such relationships are VERY PRONE to abuse and it's no big burden (though it may seem that way to an immature sixteen year old) to wait until legal adulthood. But our desire to condemn these relationships shouldn't lead us to go so far as to pretend things about teenagers we know aren't true. In the main, absent actual coercion, teenagers really do understand what sex is, and really can choose whether to engage in it, and really can validly be handed the consequences of those choices if that's necessary to protect an innocent third party like a child conceived along the way. Teenagers are dumb but they're not THAT dumb. 
In Soviet Russia, this technology is up in you. 
You don't get ruled incompetent for being irresponsible. You can blow your money on stupid things and no ones going to have you adjudicated incompetent for it. Incompetence is when you are mentally unable to manage your affairs. Not unwilling to manage them properly. 
"Is human life" is way too black and white for thinking about, well, anything. Your skin cells are human life. Gametes are human life. Unimplanted fertilized eggs that the body expels naturally are human life. \n\nAnd no one cares about any of them. \n\nWe have a continuum. At "baby," we seem to view the human life in question as sufficiently developed to worry about. At "fertilized but not yet implanted egg" literally no one cares- everyone is content to let nature take its course even though nature kills about a third of these. \n\nOne reasonable way to view this is that the developing human life's interests and rights develop with it. Meanwhile the mother already has hers. Under this view we might conclude that abortion is perfectly reasonable early on for any reason the mother chooses, because her right to bodily autonomy easily outweighs any rights held by an undifferentiated clump of cells that can be split apart or smushed together like play dough and then left to develop into one or more people. But as it develops, the balabce of these rights might shift, and perhaps more compelling reasons might be required to justify an abortion. 
Which, in fairness, is both how they're marketed and why they're purchased. And if that's gonna be a thing, and plainly it is, we're gonna need a name to use when talking about them. \n\nI suggest "DIRFs." "Dick Insecurity Revealing Firearms."
I spent a bunch of weeks studying Protista and now I just start laughing when people say "life begins." 
Yes and no.  Yes, technically, but the law makes it a really bad idea in a lot of circumstances to challenge someone who tells you their pet is a support animal, so people get by pretty well without documentation most of the time. 
1. Inflation, and 2. If your plan to save money is to cut benefits, just say so.
So does a professional human trafficker. 
Well, remember, the Court can strike down things in part but not in whole.  So its possible for the Court to strike down part of the executive order while leaving in place the parts they think aren't unconstitutional.  And since foreigners off of US soil don't have a lot of Constitutional rights, its at least theoretically possible that a court willing to carve up this turkey with sufficient precision might end up leaving some of the order in place.\n\nI don't know for sure whether that's possible, I'm not enough of a Constitutional scholar to do the carving myself.  I just know they're allowed to carve.\n\nI'm just depressed because I know that Bannon is really running this country, and he is literally praying every night for Muslim terrorists to kill American citizens because then he can tell Trump to go scream "I TOLD YOU SO!" and to wave the bloody shirt.
Another commenter covered it.\n\n"Shortfall" as you used it to refer to social security is the point when incoming funds aren't sufficient to cover that year's obligations (ignoring any surplus built up in prior years for reasons that are not clear to me).  Your system explicitly contemplates that the government will handle gaps between money required and money generated by PSAs by kicking in extra funds.  That's the same gap.  I mean, there's some financial mumbo jumbo in the middle, but the bottom line is that people put in a bunch of money, but it wasn't enough money, so the government paid some more money from some other source.  A shortfall.
As in from another city. ARE complaints carried over for the purpose of this count? Given that the relevant stat is approximately three per year and anyone with the info to write this article would have had the info to calculate that for others instead of just for this guy, why didn't they? \n\nThis article is like... imagine a headline proclaiming that one city has five times the high school graduates of its average peer, but when you look it turns out they're not controlling for population. Would you presume that population can't be that different, so you'd better be "alarmed?"\nOr would you say, "wait a minute, it's really obvious that a big city would have more graduates than a tiny village. Why isn't this being considered? What gives?"
I'm pro choice relative to the status quo, but philosophically inclined so I feel an obligation to point out the flaws in the violinist thought experiment. \n\nTo begin, let's recognize what it does. It starts by crafting a scenario that strips out a lot of the moral intuitions that people have about the pregnancy and the obligations of a mother to her child. It substitutes a scenario that's foreign and outside our experience, and explicitly stipulates that many of the features of pregnancy that motivate people to believe in a mother-child obligation have been reversed. For example, the violinist scenario is imposed by a malevolent third party, which is not the case for most pregnancies. The fact that many people who are hostile to abortion make exceptions for rape shows how important these distinctions are to people's moral intuitions, and how they may be influencing people in the background of the violinist scenario. \n\nOnce that's done, the scenario posits a burden on its subject that probably exceeds that of pregnancy, and the target of the pitch is asked if they believe the violinists right to life means they should be forced to let this continue for the duration. In its full and classical form, if the target says yes the duration is increased until the target says no. \n\nOnce the target says no, the pitch shifts to claiming that this means there is no right to life that can override bodily autonomy, and the subject would have the right to refuse instantly. \n\nThis is less like a philosophical argument than it is like a rhetorical mugging from a Christian apologist trying to trick you into a "checkmate, atheists!" moment. \n\nThere are two easy ways to demonstrate this. The first is to take the full argument and run the slippery slope in reverse. Ask if the subject agrees he should have to accept this for nine months. If he says no, ask about nine days. Or nine minutes. Or say that the doctors have already prepared an artificial liver that will support the violinist as well as you could, but they need nine seconds to safely switch the violinist to the artificial liver or else he will die. Is it ok for you to rip out the tube *then?* Can an orderly hold your arms for the nine seconds needed to save the violinists life? And as soon as the target says what you want him to, that the orderly could validly restrain him for nine seconds, claim that this shows that a right to life outweighs bodily autonomy, and try to convince him that he's now on the hook for a nine month sentence. \n\nAnd if none of that works add in intuition drivers that go the opposite direction. It's not you on the table, it's an abusive father, and a crazed vigilante has connected him to his daughter, whom he's been molesting for nine years. When he wakes and sees the tube he starts screaming that he's always hated his daughter and doesn't care if she dies, while trying to rip the tube out.  You're the orderly. Is it ok to restrain him for nine minutes? Seconds? Even though that violates his bodily autonomy? \n\nThat illustrates what's really going on. There are two interests being considered- the violinists and yours. And the violinist scenario does its best to cook the books against the violinist... and then to trick the subject into thinking that deciding against the violinist once means agreeing with a timeless principle that obliges them to oppose the violinist in all other scenarios. But it works both directions precisely because it's a trick. \n\nThe other quick trick to show the sleight of hand is to run the violinist scenario again, except instead of using abortion and liver tubes, use child support and a guy named Vinny who hits you up for cash every month, and will lock you in his basement if you don't pay.
I think whether you're wrong or not depends on what you mean by "likely to attack."  My dachshund (adopted as an adult) used to be extremely "likely to attack" (he wants to be in charge but he's tiny so he tries to intimidate other dogs and new people and it doesn't work, and if they move towards him suddenly he instantly transitions to fear based defensive aggression, this can be bypassed by forcing him to get to know new people and dogs for about an hour with a muzzle on, and preventing him from encountering new people or dogs in uncontrolled settings) but he weighs ten pounds and people forget about it pretty quick. \n\nBy contrast, rarer acts of aggression from a pit bull will be more memorable, because they might involve someone's face getting ripped off. \n\nAmericans have this weird insistence of only ever discussing desire to do harm... but capacity to do harm is also important. A frequently aggressive gerbil is still a gerbil. An occasionally aggressive fighting dog can kill children, and sometimes even adults. A mini dachshund who defensively bites a dozen times per year is a terrible dog who should be properly trained and rehabilitated, but is still a manageable problem. A pit who aggressively bites once in ten years might need put down. \n\nWith great power comes great responsibility, and all that. 
ARE bank accounts more stable and resilient than government communications systems?
You can't stop using language just because it will be co opted by the Alex Jones style anti American right. \n\nThey're going to co opt anything effective. \n\nAnd there's nothing to be done about it. We're talking about a demographic who thinks that it's fine if the President openly expresses admiration for the "Sandy Hook was all actors" nutcase. If they can be convinced to swallow something like that they can be convinced to misuse a word. 
I'm just posting for people interested in the Washington post article. \n\nThis guys "even the Washington post" stuff is disingenuous. The post is a real newspaper and prints opinion articles from a wide array of points of view. This one is from a well known very, very staunch conservative. It does not represent the Washington post and implying it does is dishonest. \n\nFurther, the article isn't very good. Statements indicating intent to discriminate are frequently used to aid in determining whether a law does in fact discriminate. \n\nThe only thing here that's even close to unique is the fact that the statements were campaign statements. Volokh's arguments that the Presidents oath somehow cleanses any intent he may have had pre and post swearing in is so dumb it brings into question Volokh's integrity (does anyone anywhere actually believe that a politician who promises to do a thing while running and then does it once elected is engaging in two separate behaviors that one cannot draw a line between when considering why the latter is happening? It's idiotic). And the issue is unique enough that neither of the cases Volokh cites are even close to on point in terms of their legal findings. 
I'm saying, given that the author of this article has "total complaints" and "duration over which complaints occurred" for this guy, presumably that's information that's available for other officers. So, the author could have given us good statistics, like "complaints per year," and compared them. But instead the author opted for a statistic that looks bad at first until we realize that it is meaningless unless we make a bunch of assumptions. \n\nYou don't know how complaints were calculated for this article. You don't know if this guy had a longer career than his peers (he probably did, since some of them are no doubt new and he's getting a promotion). You don't know a lot of things that could be relevant. But you're filling in the gaps based on your prejudices about Chicago cops, and concluding that if an article tells you there's smoke via a not actually conclusive smoke detecting methodology that has a lot of obvious holes and assumptions, we should be worried about fire. 
I wouldn't blame mental health laws for not doing a better job of accounting for your buddy's decision to tell lies about his mental health in hopes of defrauding his landlord. 
I think the issue is that if you study exoplanets your sense of what is or isn't like earth gets skewed by all of the alien hellscapes you witness. Eventually you find something with only one and a half times the gravity and where the acid rain occasionally stops and you declare "it's just like earth!"\n\nAnd then you go home and have trouble telling your daughter and your dog apart because they're both hairy mammals I mean have you even SEEN Protista under a good microscope come on it's an easy mistake to make after a while. 
He did.  And then congressional Republicans informed us that this would not be "a priority" for them, and then he had a talk with them and came back with one of his more hilarious quotes: \n\n"That's not a very Republican thing -- I didn't even know that, frankly." Donald Trump, after finding out that congressional a Republicans don't care about his infrastructure plans.\n\nIf he pulls this off I'll give him credit, but I stand by my characterization of decades worth of Republican rhetoric.
Its a simple and cogent explanation for why Donald Trump is so friendly with Russia, that doesn't involve Russia having blackmail info on him. \n\nBrannon's speeches on the Church Militant are publicly available. His speeches and writings and commentary on ethnic and religious clash of culture are publicly available. Trump's foreign policy friends and goes list exactly matches Bannon's, and Bannon's lines up with his well established "let's prep for a showdown" view of ethnic politics- a POV that basically accepts the world view of ISIS re: clash of religion and ethnicity, but roots for Christendom instead of Islam. \n\nThe CMV asks for political analysis. Nothing about political analysis requires that it be pleasant, and Bannon is not a pleasant person. 
Conservatives have spent decades telling us that government infrastructure spending is economically disastrous. China is engaged in some of the bigger infrastructure investments the world has ever seen. \n\nI guess we're gonna find out who's right. 
> he's been stopped or at least hindered by the public\n\nCourts, not the public.\n\n> nor even an American\n\nOk, so, this is actually an interesting point that I don't think a lot of non Americans know.  The United States is basically Democracy 1.0, and everyone else in the world is running on a more recent version.  The US version of democracy was put together by people who were absolutely terrified of the government accomplishing anything at all.  The first version of our constitution (the articles of confederation) included so many rules preventing elected officials from actually doing anything that the whole system collapsed.  That system was replaced after only 12 years, though we actually realized it needed replaced a lot earlier and just did a really bad job of getting the replacement written in a timely manner.  The replacement recognized that sometimes elected officials need to actually do things, or else a country can't function.  But it was still being written by people who were really, really, REALLY worried about the government having too much power, so they deliberately designed the entire system with redundant steps that are only really useful for stopping things from working.\n\nThis has bedeviled our country for centuries at this point.  To do VIRTUALLY ANYTHING, you need the president, half the house of representatives, half the relevant committee in the house of representatives or more in certain cases, sixty percent of the senate, half the relevant committee in the house of representatives or more in certain cases, five supreme court justices, and time.  AND there are a lot of places along the way where having just a single person disagree with you can create delays that force and can force you to seek even larger majorities than you're technically required to on paper.\n\nThe ironic outcome of all of this is that the legislature, recognizing that this system is shit and doesn't actually work, has delegated enormous amounts of power to the executive branch in the form of orders that the executive branch create and manage various regulatory agencies under sets of rules written for the executive branch by the legislature.  This not only makes things even more complex, because to truly understand who can do what you need to understand regulatory procedure law, but it also very ironically makes the President far more powerful than the original framers of the constitution probably wanted, because the President can heavily influence the operation of the regulatory bodies.  BUT.  The President can only influence them within the discretion allotted to him by the legislature, including discretion given to him ACCIDENTALLY (that's an actual thing!) due to the way that our system lets the President control all budget prioritization during periods in which regulatory bodies are under-funded by the legislature, which is ALWAYS, which usually means that he can stop them from working correctly, but can't actually push them to do much other than what the legislature said.\n\nTLDR, its really hard to accomplish anything at all in the US system and every party who wins anything always feels frustrated.  Right now President Trump is actually being MORE successful at getting his agenda passed than most other Presidents, because the legislature is from his party.  Most of his major failings at this point have been his own unforced errors, such as spending months calling his muslim ban a "muslim ban" and then letting Guiliani go on TV and say that he did his best to write a muslim ban that wouldn't be held unconstitutional, and then including existing permanent legal residents on US soil in the ban- a choice that was so obviously unconstitutional that he was forced to walk it back, but nothing in the actual order justifies walking it back.\n\nBasically, our system sucks at getting things done by design, and Trump sucks at getting things done as a person.
I play morally for the most part. I might steal all of a downed raiders clothes, patch him up, and shove him out the door into the rim world wilderness  naked and unarmed, but I won't execute him or steal his organs or his skin. 
That's still pseudo math.  You have no idea whether those people worked for comparable amounts of times on the relevant police force.
Step one- get hired to work as an American troll. \n\nStep two- outsource to three Russians. Let them keep 20% of what they earn you. Promise them that if they outsource further they can keep 20% of anything earned by downstream trolling producers. \n\nStep three- explain that 20% may not look like much, but if they recruit three more people each, and those people recruit three more each, and THOSE people recruit three more each, they'll earn literally dozens of dollars. \n\nStep four- await trollpocalypse. 
You have no way of knowing that all commanders have similar tenure length. You have no way of knowing if these stats are career complaints or just complaints at Chicago. You have no way of knowing if some of the other commanders were recently hired from outside Chicago and therefore have virtually zero complaints in this data set, skewing the average. You're assuming that commanders are at the ends of their careers, except that apparently this commander is getting promoted further along his career. There are a ton of things you don't know, but you're happy to make presumptions based on an article that uses career total complaints without ever considering whether careers are comparable. You shouldn't be willing to make these presumptions. You are choosing to look at data that is obviously incomplete, and where in every case the incompleteness would tend to make things appear worse than they are to a casual reader, and being far too confident in the conclusions you jump to along the way. 
Steve Bannon is part of that psychotic group of nutballs who believe that the world is on an inevitable course to an unavoidable Epic Grande Finale between the Islamic and Christian world.\n\nNutballs like that put Russia on the Christendom side for some reason.\n\nTrump does whatever Bannon says. 
Please see my response to everyone else who has posted that. \n\nShort version- this is the ONLY thing regarding which congressional Republican leadership has made clear they will ignore Trump. Because, like I said, conservatives have a long standing anti infrastructure spending position. \n\n"That's not a very Republican thing -- I didn't even know that, frankly." Donald Trump, after finding out that congressional a Republicans don't care about his infrastructure plans. 
But if you have to use a slippery slope based pseudo philosophical mugging to do it, maybe this is a conversation that shouldn't be happening. 
Conservatism 2017: "We defect in all prisoners dilemmas."
1. I don't consider Parental Surrender to be a serious idea. \n\n2. If we really, really want to treat pregnancy like tort law, here's how it would work, presuming up front that an unplanned impregnation is a mutually negligent act between two equally negligent parties. \n\nAn accidental pregnancy would be a jointly created harm suffered, in the absence of legal redress, entirely by the woman. \n\nThe baseline adjudication would be that both parties have an obligation to take on half the harm. Meaning, half of all of the negative consequences of the unplanned pregnancy, including a 50% financial redress for pain and suffering and physical harm suffered by the woman. But see below. \n\nThe woman would have a legal obligation to mitigate damages as completely as possible. Presuming the legality of abortion, abortion would be the most thorough method. Any damages that the woman could have mitigated but which she opted not to mitigate would be entirely hers. Any costs of mitigation would be chargeable to the man at the same 50% rate as above. \n\nPlanned pregnancies would not fall under this as the law would presume that the parties worked out their division of obligations on their own and tort law was inapplicable. \n\nCaveat- some (stupid) states have comparative negligence laws that may deny any compensation whatsoever to parties who were even 1% responsible for the overall negligence. Presumably a woman in such a state would get nothing, or this would be deemed to be a situation in which that (stupid) rule does not apply. \n\nInterestingly, one might argue that if a woman dies as a direct result of the pregnancy and in spite of having made all reasonable efforts at mitigating that risk, a wrongful death suit could be filed against the man. \n\nAlso, one might argue that a woman who attests that she has a firm moral conviction that abortion is wrong is thereby made immune to the obligation to mitigate. This would be analogous to wrongful death suits by the estates of jehovahs witnesses who wouldn't have died if they received blood transfusion, but refused them on religious grounds.\n\nEdited to add- real life style example. John and Carl are each 50% at fault for negligently playing with firearms together while drunk. In the process a shotgun discharges, vaporizing Carl's finger and shooting a shotgun hole into Carl's roof. Repairs cost $1000. Carl could repair it but doesn't. John can't repair it because it's not his house. Carl doesn't repair the hole, and water damage results, amounting to $25,000 and increasing the repair cost to an additional $10,000. The two have a falling out and Carl sues John over the incident. \n\nThey're both half at fault. John will owe Carl half his medical bills for the finger, plus half an amount determined to represent pain, suffering, etc. This represents using the law to even out who has to deal with the harm the two jointly caused. John also owes half the amount Carl would have needed to repair the roof had he done so in s timely fashion. He does not owe anything for the water damage though, since Carl let that happen all on his own.
The entire idea of summarizing your capacity to build and infrastructure buildings, deploy workers on public projects, pursue cultural projects, and levy and train military, into one single "production" statistic is a pretty major simplification already. I'm willing to accept "hills have minerals and you can mine them and metals make everything easier" as a corresponding simplification. \n\nIn real life production comes from physical infrastructure and a workforce trained to use it. Terrain barely matters except for farming and transit. The highway system and rail system are the modern version of terrain- you can be in a featureless void but if two highways cross and you've got a rail stop you can make a city. 
Whatever their initial purpose may have been, "tacticool" is a thing these days no matter how many downvotes reddit throws my way.\n\nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tacticool
Well, by its wording, it DOES apply to existing green card holders, doesn't it?  Wasn't the uncertainty less of a "we can't figure out what this means," and more of a "they can't possibly be right, can it?"\n\nEven if the full order is struck down, the nature of a judicial ruling is that the court will have to explain why it reached its conclusion.  And Trump can take that and have a more competent lawyer than Guiliani (whom I would sue for malpractice were he to do to me what he did to Trump when he went on TV and openly admitted that the whole reason Trump had him write up the ban was to let him satisfy his campaign promise as much as possible without being unconstitutional) write up a better tailored, more constitutionally plausible ban.
He started going on and on about how sexual relationships between 13 year olds and 25 year olds can be really positive for the 13 year old. \n\nThe whole speech is online. I'm not going to link it because I don't feel like contracting internet cancer, but it should be easily located if you want to view it in context. \n\nThere is some reference to his own experiences, but I gotta say, "sexual relationships between 13 year olds and adults are fine, just look how I, Milo, turned out!" is the bleakest unintentional joke of 2017. 
Broadly speaking, I agree with you.  In particular I agree with you with respect to DACA immigrants, and I think its shameful that Trump is stabbing them in the back.\n\nBut I do have one additional caveat.  \n\nAs a country we have systematically refused to enforce immigration laws against employers who hire illegal immigrants.  For decades.  With enthusiastic, albeit deeply hypocritical, support from Republicans.  The degree to which this is true is almost hysterical- I remember recently reading an article in which a bunch of Trump voting farmers were talking about how they couldn't afford to bring in their crops without illegal immigrant labor, and how they really hope Trump understood their "small business" needs and wouldn't focus on *their* illegal immigrants.  Who were of course working the fields in the background while the interview was taking place, in the open, in farms that are well known to everyone including INS to be places where illegal immigrants work, so much so that they're comfortable being interviewed about it and photographed.\n\nThis has created a de facto system in which illegal immigration is encouraged and rewarded by the US government as a means of providing cheap labor for agricultural businesses and a few other sectors.  Mexican people have built their lives on this.  \n\nBecause of our own culpability in creating this system of illegal-but-tacitly-accepted immigration, I think we have an obligation not to be complete dicks to the people who have relied upon this system in order to improve their lives.  I think that just declaring, "well, they're breaking the law, and that's that" is unfair if we intentionally ignored their law breaking for years because we wanted things that way.
Can you provide an example or two that meet the following criteria?\n\nA constitutional clause with\n\n1. A clear meaning\n\n2. That isn't written into the constitution in a manner that suggests that it is intended to peg the constitution to the common law as the common law changes over time\n\n3. That has subsequently been reinterpreted through a cultural lens?
> If you want to remove the discrepency youd have to go global because the US has by far the highest rate of gun ownership. If you do that, you reach over 20k deaths a year from terrorism and not even remotely close for accidental child related firearms fatalities.\n\nWhy would we possibly have to "go global" on terrorism statistics to account for America's high rate of gun ownership?  That just leaves us comparing international statistics on terrorism to US domestic statistics on accidental gun deaths, which is asinine.\n\n> then removing the worst year for terror attacks.\n\nFunctional illiteracy is a curse.\n\n> No matter how you try to spin this its undeniable that terror attacks are a far greater threat to the average person and its insanity to pretend otherwise.\n\nMathematical illiteracy is also a curse.  You don't want to get into a discussion of relative threat levels; to do so you'd have to adjust your risk levels to account for the population differences between "all americans" and "american children," which 1) would screw your position even harder, and 2) is obviously way too hard for you.
Why do you feel that distinction is meaningful? Can you give a rule that would help us determine what other situations are like baking a cake for a gay couple, and what are like baking a cake for a gay couples wedding? 
Maybe YOU'RE using it that way, but not what Judith Jarvis Thomson wrote, and that's not the way I ever see it.  What she wrote and what I see is an intuition ratchet and nothing more.
Liane is wearing her chest guard on the wrong side. 0/10 literally unplayable. \n\nActually I'm pretty excited.  I picked up\nAtelier Sophie on PC as kind of a gamble- as s PC gamer I rarely get the chance to play true JRPGs, and I wanted to try one, even if I was a little nervous about the crafting thing. Crafting in a lot of games is a task of rote memorization, but in this you need actual long term planning and execution once you hit the mid to late game. I won't finish Sophie in time for Firis' release, but knowing it will already be out once I'm interested in playing another Atelier game is pretty cool. \n\nBut seriously. Wrong side. 
That was the weird, almost optimistic thing about Idiocracy.  The dumb people were, ultimately, good natured.  They weren't malevolent, they were just stupid.\n\nWhat we have in real life are people who aren't stupid, they're just malevolent.  And in their malevolence they're willing to believe any slander they hear about the people they hate the most.  So they come across as very stupid, because they end up believing a lot of really stupid things.  \n\nBut they're not stupid people, they're just evil.
The article doesn't say he has five times the complaints of the next commander. It says he has five times the average. Which is one of those weirdly chosen statistics that should make you raise an eyebrow. Let's say that one or two of the other commanders were recently hired from outside the department and have close to zero, and that this guy's promotion is connected to his long tenure in office as a commander and his seniority. It's very possible that averages were selected to make this look as bad as possible. \n\nWhat's actually concerning is why the article insists on using career totals rather than complaints per year. Surely the authors have that information. 
It's absolutely not confirmed at all. We know Martin approached to confront Zimmerman about Zimmerman following him in his SUV. The ONLY testimony we have about how or why that approach became violent is from Zimmerman. I acknowledge (repeatedly) that it isn't surprising that Zimmerman's uncontradicted (more importantly, uncontradictable, because Martin is dead) testimony was enough to raise a reasonable doubt. \n\nMy point, which I made pain staking my clear, is simply that people who are absolutely convinced that Zimmerman was in the right, are relying only on the testimony of the accused as to an absolutely key part of Zimmerman's defense. Maybe we can't say that Zimmerman is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but conviction in his innocence beyond doubt is completely unreasonable given the facts available to us. It is literally nothing more than declaring that if Zimmerman insists on his innocence, thats enough to be sure of it. That's not how crimes work. 
Politics is weird.  I have a Muslim acquaintance who by all rights should be a Republican.  But, Trump.  So he's as anti Republican as you can get.
Because people are physically making them with scrap wood and carpet from contruction jobs.
Short answer- you can't get put in jail for failure to pay child support without a court finding that you could have paid but didn't. Typically, repeatedly and egregiously. 
Unlike the rest of reddit, I had a double digit age back in 2008. So I remember Obama entering office with an infrastructure plan, and a republicans flipping out and going to the wall to oppose it. You're 100% right he didn't do much for infrastructure, but I remember why. \n\nAnd we're going through the same experience now. Trump talked up infrastructure in his campaign. The moment he won congressional republicans started telling the press that Trump's infrastructure goals weren't going to be a priority for them. And now we all get to watch as "infrastructure" gets defined down to "oil pipelines and giveaways to the coal industry and selling federal lands at fire sale prices to for profit companies who promise to develop them for private profit." 
It was. But please see my reply to others pointing that out. The short version is that Trump is an ENORMOUS outlier on this issue, and congressional republican pushback on this began the moment he won the election. \n\nThere are even Trump quotes from after they had one of their little talks with him about it where he expresses surprise at finding out that infrastructure investment isn't really a conservative thing. 
Are you seriously arguing that if corporate taxes were lower, businesses wouldn't try to avoid paying them? \n\nIf Big Corp is taxed at 35% but actually pays 15%, and you cut their tax rate to 25%, dodging taxes by hiring accountants to help them shelter money still gets them somewhere between a 14 and 20% lower effective rate, depending on how things are calculated. That's still real money. The percentage of businesses who decide that it's cheaper to pay taxes than to hire people to help them avoid paying taxes will be utterly negligible, ESPECIALLY considering that most of them are going to be hiring accountants either way. 
Short answer 1- you're describing commercial science, not academic. Academic science also has a problem with "interesting" studies being more widely published than uninteresting ones, which makes replication checks less prestigious than original research, and makes it easier to widely publish positive results than negative ones. But it's not cynical or money driven, it's just human. \n\nShort answer 2- the FDA is not under regulatory capture. On the sliding scale of "approve this drug quickly, there are lives at stake" versus "be very cautious, there are lives at stake," it leans towards the latter relative to other countries. 
The whole point of avoiding conflicts of interest is so that your political decisions don't look like corrupt efforts to advance yourself and your family.\n\nObama didn't have stock in Fox's competitors.  It was apparent that his statements about Fox related to the relationship between Fox and Obama in terms of Fox's status as a news source with an openly acknowledged political agenda, and Obama's status as a President in opposition to that agenda.\n\nTrump's relationship with Nordstrom is that of father using the Presidential bully pulpit to call out a business with which his daughter was in conflict on a business matter.\n\nIt is shameful that we have become a country where this is acceptable.  The biggest damage Trump is going to do to us is to make us think that it is normal for a President to use his Presidential status to advance his family's financial interests.  If Republicans feel obliged to accept this since its coming from their President, we will be half a nation closer to being a banana republic.
The less important point to make here is that it literally didn't apply to all faiths.  It specifically included preferential admission for "minority faiths" of known Muslim majority countries, meaning, "all the people who aren't Muslim."\n\nBut the more important point is that the Constitution is generally interpreted to not only prohibit certain forms of discrimination, but also acts which are legally engineered to look like they're not discrimination, while accomplishing discriminatory goals.  And one of the ways we know when this is happening is by examining the politics surrounding the passage of the law.\n\nFor example, if a particular city has a big public debate in their city hall about "all the jews" coming into town, and how something needs to be done about "all the jews," and then they pass a law that's supposedly about animal abuse but "just happens" to force the kosher butcher to close while having literally no effect on any other existing business or animal care practice, courts are allowed to say, "Hmmm.... we think the animal abuse thing is a cover for efforts at excluding jews, which you're not allowed to do, and you KNOW you're not allowed to do, which is probably why you're talking up the animal abuse thing in the law while having public debates about jews in real life... so this is unconstitutional."
> How would Martin know Zimmerman was armed when the firearm was concealed? Martin could not know Zimmerman was armed until Zimmerman drew his firearm, and that didn't happen until well after Martin attacked him.\n\nOnce again we see that Zimmerman's supporters do not understand that one should apply just a hiiiiiiiiiint of skepticism when considering the testimony of the accused.
The executive branch's prerogatives are limited by the Constitution, including the bill of rights.  Ample evidence exists that the travel ban was motivated by religious animus, and not by a good faith belief that the ban would protect us against (admittedly religiously based) terrorism.  This evidence includes but is not limited to,\n\n1. The incredibly poor tailoring of the ban itself to the threats we face,\n\n2. Trump's statements prior to the ban in which he regularly characterized it as a ban of Muslim entry into the US,\n\n3. The statements of Guiliani where he proudly admitted that he was asked to craft this ban to satisfy Trump's Muslim ban promise as much as possible without being unconstitutional, suggesting that the national origins aspect is pretextual.
How is this possibly being downvoted? The Republican Party threatened to force the US to default on it's debts unless democrats promised to help them overturn the ACA. They've repeatedly threatened and carried out government shutdowns in order to extract unrelated policy concessions. And that was before this last election- they've gotten worse on this score since!\n\nAnyone who thinks the Republicans wouldn't exercise the nuclear option is stone cold ignorant about the positions of the American political parties.

The rule stating that courts cannot jail someone for failure to pay child support without a specific finding of ability to pay is a national one, crafted by the Supreme Court. 
Realistically...\n\nFrom the article, and from basic knowledge of prosecutor's offices...\n\nIt says that these cases weren't entered into the case management system.  The case management system is a workflow tracking system used to make sure that you meet all your deadlines and keep every case moving forward.  Cases don't start out in it- they start out in the form of police reports and so on.  Somebody's job is to review these things, determine whether the report justifies filing charges, then input the case into the system to get the ball rolling.\n\nIf you're not the guy who's job it is to review the case and input it into the system, then, if this works like things I'm familiar with, you literally won't even know that the case exists.  You'll get your daily tasks from a computer, but the un-entered case will be in the form of a physical folder in someone's desk drawer, or a series of emails in someone's inbox, or something along those lines, to which you really have no access.\n\nThe article, and the incoming prosecutor, keep talking about child sexual abuse cases.  But if I had to wager a guess, there were probably a BUNCH of cases sitting ignored in someone's desk drawer or inbox, awaiting review and processing.\n\nI'd like to think that either the police or the victims would be able to reach the supervisor of whatever person or persons was responsible for the work that wasn't getting done, and that the supervisor would follow up and discover the backlog.  I don't know why that didn't happen... or if it DID happen, and this is the backlog that still remained.\n\nI remember working with a large corporation once.  I can't name it for legal reasons.  Suffice to say, they had an employee who literally didn't do half of her work.  The problem was, the work was the sort of thing where literally every customer, even the ones who were being attended to properly, complained constantly about how long things were taking.  So she went under the radar for a few months before vanishing and being replaced by someone else (no one confirmed to me that she was fired, but she was mysteriously gone one day and someone else was answering her phone, and her work started to move again).  But firing her was only half the solution- now there was a giant backlog of work that needed moved forward, and it wasn't always even that easy to figure out what was or wasn't done.\n\nTLDR- while this is definitely really bad, I would assume an incompetent employee or two in an overworked office before assuming malice, and I would assume that the child sexual abuse cases that were ignored are just the most morally egregious of a long list of cases that were ignored.  I doubt any prosecutor is actually trying to go easy on child abusers on purpose.
I think you may be making an unfair comparison.  "Hillary Clinton's Private Email Server" isn't the same thing as "government communication systems as a whole."\n\nThe biggest vulnerability on government communications systems appears to just be phishing.  But bank accounts get phished all the time too.  So... ARE government communications systems more secure than banks?

The Sand Snakes.\n\nLike they are simply the instruments that Elaria uses to achieve her ends and could just as easily be 3 random nameless guards.  They tried to kidnap Myrcella but got stopped by Bronn and Jamie and then Areo and his men.  Then they sit in prison playing games but not really doing anything significant and then they kill Trystane and Areo but again that could have been done with poison or just 3 random guards backstabbing them both.\n\nElaria didn't actually need any of them as none of them actually have any specific skills beyond simple combat proficiency.  One is a bitchy spear fighter the other a frumpy double dagger fighter who also uses poison and the third an ineffectual whip and dagger fighter.  The 3 or 4 guards Jamie and Bronn met on the beach were a bigger challenge than the Sand Snakes.\n\nThey were probably much more meaningful in the books (haven't read them) but in the show they are not only useless but they are not at all entertaining.

>NEW SECTION.\nSec. \n3.\nA new section is added to chapter 9.41 RCW \nto read as follows:  All firearm sales or transfers, in whole or part in\nthis state \nincluding  without  limitation  a  sale  or  transfer  where  either  the \npurchaser  or  seller  or  transferee  or  transferor  is  in  Washington, \nshall be subject to background checks **unless specifically exempted by \nstate or federal law.**  The background check\nrequirement applies to all \nsales or transfers including, but not limited to, sales and transfers \nthrough  a  licensed  dealer,  at  gun  shows,  online,  and  between \nunlicensed persons.\n\nIf a C&R license holder, as per federal law, does not require any type of background check when purchasing a qualifying firearm I would think that exemption by federal law would be enough to qualify under that exemption in the state law.
As it turns out over 140 years of national history tend to agree with me hence why we have all these nonwhite nonchristians in this nation and no slaves as much as that pisses ignorant racists like you off.
Probably it stick has a headphone jack. 
Yes you are a disgusting person.  There was never any law saying that people of certain religions or races could not live here and in fact I do believe that the constitution states and the founders stated as well that this nation is not a christian nation and the first amendment specifically states this and so this retarded idea of no nonwhites and no non christians is entirely false.\n\nYou're just a disgusting person.  
> Jon isn't going to have to worry about the politics of kings landing\n\nHe still needs to understand the game itself.  The game for power which as KITN he is now playing regardless if he likes it or not.  Littlefinger has plans and Jon was not among them.  Cersei, Danny hell even whatever is left of the Freys in the Twins and Riverrun now represent pieces in the game that Jon needs to be able to distinguish and manipulate when possible or spot manipulation on their part to protect himself and his people and because he has spent his entire life in an environment of soldiers and fighters he has no idea what dealing with politicians is really like and Sansa does and she represents that knowledge base for Jon.  
If you legitimately think that is what I meant then I don't think you should be driving let alone voting.
A Lannister always pays their debts.  
> that total gun control works in Europe and East Asia. \n\nOnly 1 nation in the world that I have found has 100% total gun control(banning of all civilian ownership of guns) and that is North Korea.  Every single nation other than them allows for some form of civilian firearms ownership.  And this ignores entirely the logistical, historical and legal aspects of the topic.  Some nations might never had many civilian owned firearms to begin with nor much domestic firearms production making gun control easier to enact and maintain.\n\nAnd what is total gun control and what constitutes it "working"?\n\nPeople constantly point to Australia as a pinnacle of gun control working because they haven't had any mass shootings since Port Arthur (they actually have).  But here is the thing.  If you look at all incidents of [mass murder in Aus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia#Massacres) in the same 21 year time period pre Port Arthur when guns were easier to get as opposed to Post Port Arthur when guns were heavily restricted, you find that actually more people were killed in mass murders after they enacted their gun control but they were simply killed by different means.\n\nSo if the only point of gun control is to stop people from being killed specifically by guns then sure it works great.  But it doesn't actually stop people from being killed because it doesn't address why someone feels it is appropriate to kill people.
Get rid of those torps on biggs and give him R2D2 instead of R7 to keep him alive longer.
> Bend the knee Liberals. Democracy is dead. America is dead.\n\n**WE DO NOT KNEEL!  AND WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE BUT RISES HARDER AND STRONGER!!!**
Likely because liberals/democrats tend to push for gun control and conservatives/republicans tend to push for gun rights.\n\nMany people tend to be single issue voters and for some of those people gun rights are that single issue.\n\nI won't say that it is for me the most important factor in deciding whom to vote for but I will be honest and say that it is a leading factor in deciding to not vote for someone.\n\nedit:  And it would be ignorant to assume that people who are avid supporters of gun rights are not also avid supporters of other rights too.  But the difference is that fewer people are yelling to protect gun rights and so those of us that do must yell louder.  The result is that you hear us individually more when we talk about guns because we blend into the larger crowd when talking about supporting other rights.
> The two sides of this country have Sunni/Shiite level hate towards each other\n\nTalk about hyperbole.  We are not even close to that level of discord in this nation.  \n\n>There's no coming back from the right declaring open war by electing a dictator.\n\nDude you need to calm down.  If Germany can come back from Hitler and Russia from Stalin the USA can get through Trump.
We are founded out of revolution from a perceived oppressive govt so it makes sense that such a notion would be a consistent feature in American culture.\n\nPlus look at govts all over the world and how casually they feel like they can invade the privacy of their citizens, spy on them, ignore their laws when they feel like it and basically are accountable only to themselves.\n\nHow much trust should we have in these institutions to continually work towards our good and not theirs at the expense of ours?
> I don't see the end goal for her character. Sansa is strong now, okay, but she's still ancillary to the main story unless Jon dies\n\nRight now Sansa is Jon's best source of information on how Kings Landing actually works, the way that people act and are influenced and effectively how to play the game of thrones.  Jon does not know this nor is he concerned with it just like Ned, but just like Ned that gives him a **HUGE** blindspot that before Ned had nobody to fill but now Sansa can fill and protect Jon where Ned wasn't.
> Should it protect grenade launchers? Those would be fun until grenades were raining down on crowds in a theater or night club.\n\nYou can currently legally own grenades and grenade launchers as well as flare launchers that can fire similar projectiles and here we sit in a world blessedly free of these random grenade attacks you are fearing.  Seriously that is the worst defense I have ever heard.  Random grenade attacks on night clubs and theaters...\n\n>How about stinger missiles? Just don't fly again, ever. Perhaps nuclear arms? That would be a nice way to end humanity. I don't think putting reasonable limits on the 2nd amendment is unreasonable.\n\nJesus fucking christ every single time the 2a gets mentioned you people have to trot this shit out like it is an actual argument against the 2a.  **NOBODY IS SAYING THE 2A PROTECTS NUKES OR MISSILES** but that is a great strawman to create...  \n\nWe are talking about firearms and firearms only.  Handguns, rifles and shotguns.  
> Only the Sith deal in absolutes.\n\nAre you... absolutely sure about that???
>calls for removing restrictions on the sale of gun silencers; allowing gun dealers to have more guns used in crimes traced to their stores before the federal government requires additional information from the dealer; and initiating a study on lifting the ban on imported assault weapons.\n\nThe part about silencers would actually bring us inline with places like the UK where firearm suppressors are considered hearing protection and are sold over the counter, as it were, without requiring any special licenses or fees.\n\nThe second part is a bit wordy but sounds like they want it to take more guns from crimes traced to a specific store before it triggers some sort of ATF investigation.  If right now it takes like 5 guns in 1 years from 1 store to trigger this and they want to raise the bar to 10 in a year that may or may not be very bad depending on various environmental factors and if local ATF resources would be saved and put to better more efficient use.  But if it is like 5 guns in a year from 1 store and they want to raise that to 50 then that is a big problem.\n\nThe third one makes a logical sense.  If we can make and buy these things here then why can we not import them from abroad?  Especially since the defining features of an "assault weapon" are all cosmetic.  I mean that would be like saying in order to protect public safety no alcohol made outside the USA can be imported but any made inside is 100% legal...  That doesn't really protect public safety as much as domestic market share for some brands.  \n\nPersonally I'd say 2 of 3 of these seem like actual common sense and the one regarding gun stores and guns sold that end up used in crimes needs a lot more info but I'd support that.  I mean come on.  If a gun store is selling guns that get used in crimes at a higher rate than those around it I would expect a regulatory body to look into it even if it turns out it's not the fault of the FFL holder.  At least then it helps clear them of wrong doing.
I'd probably be Ed.  I'm not from a special family and don't have any super special skills other than moral lifting sarcasm.

>Quid Pro Quo isn't part of the deal\n\nHe is altering the deal.  Pray he doesn't alter it any further...\n\nBut seriously our military spending is out of control and there is only so long that we can shoulder so much of the financial burden of being the world police before we can't afford to sustain it any longer resulting in pulling back or out and so other nations need to start stepping up a bit more before that point comes.\n\nIf anything Trump getting voted in should show the rest of the world how quickly the leader of the world police can change and drastically alter the state of their national safety and as such they shouldn't rely as heavily on the USA to provide that safety when they need it so much but have so little influence over it.\n\n
> We live in the common law. That's just how it is.\n\nThe common law dictated by the constitution.  The constitution is literally the foundation of the nations laws and ignoring it and saying "well we live in a time where we can't abide by it because reasons" is bullshit.
So voter ID laws...  racist or no?\n\nI mean they need the same ID to exercise the right to vote as to buy a gun so if requiring that ID for exercising 1 right is burdensome and unconstitutional then it must be so for exercising the other...  Right?

> But on the other hand that really highlights that the problem is the semi automatic and automatic action and the fact that the 2nd amendment could never have been written in anticipation of the non-military consequences of that technology.\n\nWell as luck would have it the founders actually did know about the semi automatic and automatic technological advances in firearms as such things existed in very early forms when they ratified the 2a.  [The Belton Flintlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belton_flintlock) is the best example as it was by all definitions a fully automatic rifle that the continental congress knew of and made an order for. (cancelled only due to cost).  Then there are things like the Puckle Gun, Pepperbox revolvers, punt guns and duck foot pistols and more.  Plenty of firearms that could be classified as semi or fully automatic.  And the fact that during the entire evolution of firearms to semi automatic nature being standard in the 1800s not once did the 2a ever get changed to specify only certain types of weapons.
> How the fuck is an anti gun court a thing?\n\nWell the court issued a ruling ignoring previous SCOTUS rulings specifically saying firearms in common legal use are covered by the 2a.  They didn't do that because they are pro gun and their argument is nothing but junk.  How the hell can you argue that an amendment that says both the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed as well as that the purpose of this amendment is to allow for formation of militias, somehow does not protect the ownership of the most appropriate firearms for that cause?\n\n>What happens if SCOTUS ruled similarly? Is SCOTUS just an anti gun court too?\n\nWell that would require the SCOTUS to rule against at least 2 or 3 previous SCOTUS rulings which seems incredibly unlikely.

"The Obama administration wrote a regulation saying that people who had applied for Social Security disability benefits because of a mental condition, and whose condition makes them incapable of managing their own finances, should be referred to the FBI background check system and prevented from buying guns. That’s what Republicans have now reversed."\n\nYeah that is a really vague law and denies a right before allowing for due process just like the no fly no buy bills.  I am sure they meant they don't want people with Alzheimer or Dementia or the like to have guns but I feel like "mental condition" probably is too vague and should be a specific defined list of known conditions or specific list of diagnosed behaviors to prevent abuse.    
Then as someone with legal training you should recognize that the 4th circuit ignored the Heller, McDonald and Miller SCOTUS decisions.  
Is there any reason your dad waited so long to tell you about the note?  I mean between 10 and 24 there are a lot of stupid teenage an early 20's years where a gun can get sold for stupid reasons and then that treasure would be lost.
Reading the 2a it is obvious that arms refers to small arms meaning man portable weaponry.  A nuke is not in any sense an arm meant for a militia to use.  Rifles, pistols and shotguns are however.
Sadly I think they are the type of Trump supporters that are more about party loyalty than country loyalty.  
> This is why those on the left and center shouldn't pay attention to the right's cries about free speech being stifled on college campuses. \n\nIf "the right" can't have their own speakers appear and speak without being violently protested and the events cancelled then is that not stifling of free speech?  People are doing what they can to prevent someone from speaking their mind at the invitation of other college students specifically because they dislike and disagree with what the person says.\n\nIf you dislike what someone has to say then debate them and display why what they are saying is wrong and then you might actually change minds, don't just shout and bully them into silence or else you just reinforce their opinions.
Difference is you do not have the constitutionally protected right to drive a car or be a nurse and require no passport to travel within the USA nor do I think does the USA require you to have a passport to leave it though I believe other nations require you to have one to enter.  \n\nThose are licenses to perform jobs or operate vehicles or travel to other nations not licenses to exercise rights.  That is the distinction at play here.\n\nYou have the constitutionally protected right to vote and it has been stated that requiring an ID to vote is a burden to the poor.  If the simple requirement of that ID is a burden to the poor when they try to vote how is that same requirement not also considered equally burdensome to exercising another protected right?\n\nAnd for the record I am not arguing for voter ID laws I am simply pointing out the hypocrisy in place when requiring an ID that is at most like $20 and valid for multiple years is somehow a burden for the poor but requiring the same ID, training classes, permits and safe storage methods are not burdensome to those exact same poor people...\n\nBoth are methods used by people on both sides to discourage as many people as possible from exercising a right by making it as legally burdensome to do so as possible.
You are going to die some day.  In this scenario you can die on your feet fighting for your life and freedom or you can die on your knees cowering and praying for mercy from those trying to kill you.  \n\n
He has fallen on harder times regarding his career and as he was really enjoyable in movies like the Mummy and has a solid acting range as seen in movies like School Ties he is just a random celeb that people want to see more of.
What do we say to the god of death?\n\nNot today.
> 40,000 Americans killed by Americans....I think it's underreported and needs direct attention.\n\nThat is an interesting thing to say since there are actually only around 33k total gun deaths a year in the USA, about 22k of which are suicides, about another 1k are legal self defense another 1500 are police caused the rest are composed of accidents, criminals shootings criminals and people actually murdering other people.  And that number has been dropping over the years so it isn't exactly an epidemic that needs constant news coverage which it already gets any time anyone anywhere gets hurt by a gun...\n\nAnd again are you actually saying that the NRA advocated for no gun restrictions of any kind, guns for everyone, everywhere all the time???  Because if you are you are seriously delusional and really need help.  
So you're a white supremacist then?\n\nOur nation went to war over 70 years ago and 150 years before that to stop people like you.  \n\nI will happily volunteer to do it again if needs be.
Our first and oldest ally.  
Dude what the fuck.  We have citizens and we have residents who are here legally but not citizens.  I do not give one solid shit what race, religion, gender or sexual orientation you are.  If you are here legally one way or the other and have no intention of harming the USA or anyone here then I am ok with you being here.  \n\nIf you think this is an unreasonable position then you obviously do not understand this country and what made it great.  
Only non criminal citizens get to vote.  Sorry if it sounds mean but let us be realistic here.  They either came here legally and overstayed their visas or came here illegally but either way they broke the law to stay here.  If we forbid convicted law breakers who are American citizens from voting why would we give illegal immigrants more leeway in exercising civil rights than American citizens when they by definition are breaking the law?\n\nConvicted and released criminals pay taxes too but have to work to get their voting rights restored.  Illegal immigrants should have to work beyond just having a job, if they want to vote.
> Yet another argument the right won without even making it an argument. Any little bit of common-sense gun ownership regulation is "taking all our guns!"\n\nThe gun control left lost this fight because in general it doesn't know anything about guns it did not see in a movie or on tv.  When people trying to regulate a thing don't understand how that thing works then you get stupid and poorly made laws.  Women seem to have a huge problem with men crafting laws regarding reproductive rights and birth control and rightly so because generally speaking men know the least about these things compared to women.  So gun controllers who know the least about guns, making gun control laws is about equally stupid and why they tend to be losing.
Yeah definitely.  I find the celeb subs like  the one dedicated to bringing Brendan Frasier back into acting mainstream are generally fun but holy fuck that donald sub is downright scary.  Like I really really want them to just all be trolls because I am afraid what they would do when/if donald does get impeached or leaves office and they are not trolls.
Jesus guys I hate anti gun grandstanding celebs as much as the next guy but this is such a fucking non issue.\n\nActors are literally paid to pretend to be other people and often likely people who don't necessarily share the same values.  Is every person who plays a criminal in TV or movies a hypocrite because they likely are not pro criminal in real life?\n\nAre the actors on Game of Thrones who dare I say, all are likely to be against rape and murder, now hypocrites because they portray characters who rape and murder?\n\nMichael Gross the guy who plays Burt Gummer is not very gun friendly, Sigourney Weaver dislikes guns and even Sly Stallone has made pro gun control comments.\n\nNews Flash.  Actors portray other people for a living.  If they only portrayed people who agreed with their personal ideals nobody would ever make a WW2 movie again because not that many actors are also professed nazis.
We spend a lot of our money on the military in the USA and a good portion of that is providing military assets and presence in a lot of the world that is not America in order to provide safety and stability.\n\nThere is only so long that we as a nation can afford financially to keep spending that much and morally there is a limit to how much presence we should have in other nations.  We wouldn't really want or allow foreign military bases in our country would we?  Do we have the right to demand we have them in other nations?  And if those nations want our presence shouldn't they then financially kick in enough that the USA doesn't cripple itself financially by spending on our military what we could be spending on our infrastructure and education and medical care?\n\nI am all for supporting NATO and our allies but frankly we spend way too much on the military and that costs us the ability to afford some things that the rest of the world can like cheaper education, healthcare and social services because we are buying more jets and aircraft carriers and bases and shit.  
God you people are ignorant.  Sad.
Were they any good as a brand?  Never really had any experience with them.
>Our founding fathers were explicit about who to keep out of our country: nonwhites and non Christians. It is American as apple pie.\n\nJesus Christ you're a disgusting person who has no idea what America stands for or what freedom means.\n\nAnd apple pie isn't even an American invention you idiot.
As a dude who randomly stumbled on this thread from r/all my take is that "mansplaining" is just someone being an asshole.  Does womansplaining exist?  If so then why not just call it what it is.  Being a condescending dick?  
> Maybe we just need more intense screening.\n\nOn that general idea we can agree though I suspect we might differ on the details.
If an honest question is considered derailing and saying someone who is condescending is a dick is considered a slur then I think I'm done here.\n\nHave a good day.
Why would gun rights advocates come to the aid of someone who fucked up and shot someone unnecessarily?\n\nAnd while the NRA might not have said anything there were plenty of gun rights people who did.
I own guns because I am pro life post womb also.  
> Trump is actually restoring rule of law.\n\nNo he is not and a court just said so by putting a stay on his immigration order since it is almost certainly unconstitutional.  \n\n>Ps: the nation was already extremely divided. Trump just personified it and gave a voice to a part of the country that is both forgotten and extremely well armed. \n\nAnd he is exacerbating the problem with his actions and words.  If you are so blinded by loyalty to Trump that you can't see the damage he is enabling then you're part of the problem.
>  Cars kill more americans than just about any other for of preventable death yet we mostly ignore it.\n\nTobacco use kills around 490,000 Americans a year while cars kill around 30-35,00 ish.\n\nI'd argue tobacco is the largest killer of Americans and is perhaps the single most easily accessible form of preventable death out there. 
How long can California defend itself?  It won't get to keep any military assets without a fight and that is a fight it would lose.  If they did secede and try to form their own military how long would it take to become established and effective enough to actually deter any outside aggression?\n\nFrankly if CA seceded I could easily see the Mexican drug cartels flooding up through the border and seriously fucking with an independent CA.
The original Bond gun as well.  They called it a PPK in Dr. No but the actual screen gun used was a Walther PP in 32acp.\n\nGot me one and I love it.  
That is actually a really cool idea.  
4 boxes.  Soap, ballot, jury and ammo.  We use them to protect our freedom by using them in that order.\n\nWe are still able to use the soap box, the ballot box and jury box to some effect meaning it is not yet time to open that ammo box.\n\nWhen the govt no longer listens to the people on the soap box, ignores the results of the ballot box and ignores the will of those in the jury box then we open the ammo box on them.  NOT BEFORE THEN!
I go into that sub when big stories break about Trump or his admins to see how they react and it is the craziest and scariest thing I have ever seen.  I mean I thought the rabid Hillary supporters were bad but the level of denial, deflection, delusion and sometimes pure hatred of their fellow Americans is beyond imagination.\n\nTrump has admins that he has to ask to resign (that is politically being fired) because they effectively collude with an enemy state and these people are talking like Trump is smart and winning and a moral example and these people are not being fired they are resigning with honor.
He should consult OJ on a book.\n\nI didn't have Russia hack the election.  But if I did...
> I'd say most liberals I know simply want a discussion about it.\n\nMost pro gun people I know want a discussion too.  The problem and I say this with no intent of being insulting is that people wanting more gun control tend to not know very much about guns or the current gun laws and often when shown their lack of knowledge they tend to ignore it and purposely not educate themselves.  \n\n>People who blindly vote for someone who promises not to take away their guns, but proceeds to act contrary to American values are... well, they're not smart. \n\nTrue but that assumes you both share the same idea of what constitutes "American values" and upholding or infringing them.  I have learned recently that many people in this nation do not have that same definition.  For example to me gun rights are a core American value and people trying to curtail that right are acting in an anti American way.  Sadly there are many people in this nation that view what Trump is doing as being very American.  \n\n>The government is already waging war on the people, and has been for decades. \n\nAlso true so voluntarily surrendering any rights even ones you might not think are valid or important, should not ever be considered because I would rather have a right and not need it than need a right and not have it.\n\n>These guns are only useful once society collapses, in use against former citizens of the former USA. They will do nothing to stop tyranny. \n\nThey were pretty useful this one time in 1776...  They are also pretty useful for hunting still.  And they are actually pretty useful in modern society since defensive uses of guns outnumber offensive uses of them significantly.  The point isn't that the people are guaranteed a military victory against their own government.  The point is that if all else fails they have the right to fight and try.  But the key component there is "if all else fails".  You have to let all else fail before you try the most extreme solution or else you run the risk of making a situation worse than it would have been by escalating to violence.  Violence is the option of **last resort** but it must always be an option.\n\nAnd if guns are so useless against a tyrannical govt then why is it that the police seem to act much less aggressively when there are say gun rights protests and marches as opposed to say... Black lives matters marches or occupy wall street marches?  Because the people on the ground who have to carry out the actual tyranny when facing an armed and ready populace that outnumbers them, they tend to act more sensible.\n\nIf they can't stop tyranny then they can help us fight to take our country back from it.  \n\n>The 2A is used as a prop to snow people into voting for the very people the 2A is supposed to protect against.\n\nWell here is the thing.  The 2a is a right and a right for a good reason.  As long as the democrats stupidly fight to curtail that right they will lose votes to the GOP because of it.  It seems pretty stupid to hold a position that only drives people away and then blame the people you drove away because of that position for not voting for you.
It varies by city and state but as I understand it for the most part you can't concealed carry in an establishment that is mainly for serving alcohol but you can carry in a place that happens to also serve alcohol.\n\nSo like you can't carry a gun into a bar but can carry a gun into an restaurant and order a drink from their bar.\n\nHowever there are likely some cities or maybe even states that do allow for CC in a bar but it is not the norm.
> "Total gun control" pretty much means it's almost (but not entirely) impossible for the average citizen to buy a gun. It's pretty much what they have in Korea or Japan, and the streets of Seoul and Tokyo are incredibly safe, though gun control isn't the primary factor to that.\n\nExactly.  Gun control is not the primary factor nor is it likely a large factor since gun ownership and as I understand it generally weapon ownership isn't a popular idea in those nations.  I could be wrong though.\n\n>The low crime rates in other developed countries would disagree with that.\n\nSo you are saying that low crime rates in other countries are directly a result of gun control because that is incredibly naive.  And gun control stops gun crimes but not other crimes so saying there is lower general crime in a nation without guns compared to one with guns is pretty lame because gun ownership does not drive crime in and of itself.\n\n>Actually, the US has an extraordinarily high homicide rate compared to the rest of the world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#By_country\n\nHomicide is not the same as gun deaths.  And gun ownership does not drive homicides.  Your mixing stats now and all it does is show that the USA is generally more violent than many other nations but it in no way actually points to data saying that is specifically because of gun ownership is driving that violence.\n\n>I don't think it's deniable that having a populace with 0 guns makes a safer society, \n\nI think it is deniable. Firearms are a force equalizer and represent the only realistic way for many people of older or physically weaker dispositions to defend themselves against violent attack.  There are around 33k total gun deaths in the USA every year but an estimated minimum of 50-80,000 and upwards of possibly over 1 million defensive uses of firearms in the USA every year...  \n\n>but the real question for us is whether gun control in the US can actually keep weapons out of criminals' hands\n\nIt can't if that gun control is based entirely on banning guns because of cosmetic features which is what this ruling is about.
> Your speech is not protected from violent protest. Violent protest is illegal, but that is because it is violent.\n\nSo then my speech is actually protected from **violent protest** because violent protest itself is illegal.  Not protected from all protests just violent ones.\n\nAnd nobody is bitching about nonviolent protests against speakers.  They are bitching about ones that go beyond that and are still not called out by those that would otherwise be championing the rights of people to speak openly and freely at the invitation of others without the threat of violence as a means to silence them.
Funny since CA is the leading state for gun control and restricting the citizens right to bear arms and their ability to acquire modern arms.  Maybe now the gun control crazed left will not think the 2a only applies to muskets and is outdated...
Conversely using a fist in a gun fight is stupid.\n\nI do not think that Zimmerman acted at all appropriately in following the kid but if you're in a fight you believe is for your life then you don't hold back and you don't handicap yourself to serve some other persons sense of honor or fairness.
Never get involved in a land war in Asia.  
Just imagine how shocked the poor bastards at Eastwatch and the Shadowtower will be?  I doubt they know everything about the current state of the White Walkers and the imminent threat.  They probably think its just another day on the wall then all of a sudden they will see the wall crumbling and have no clue why.
Gods that was good!  
I'll be the one to say Ned Stark.\n\nSacrificed his rep by calling Jon his bastard instead of his nephew.  Sacrificed his safety and family stability by becoming hand of the king when he could have refused.  Sacrificed his friendship with the king to try and save Danny from assassination.  Sacrificed his safety again in giving Cersei a chance to escape Roberts wrath and once more when he backed Stannis rightly instead of Renly or going with Littlefinger's plan.  And finally sacrificed his honor in lying to say Joffrey was the true king when trying to spare Sansa and Arya from harm only to be beheaded.\n\nBasically everything Ned did in his life was a sacrifice to the greater good of the 7 kingdoms and his family starting with marrying Cat after his brother was murdered to formally ally with the Riverlands.\n\nAs short as it was I think Ned's story is one of the most tragic in the series.  Such a good man always forced to make the right decision that assuredly hurts him.
> Why didn't Georgie fight trayvon like a MAN instead of using a fucking gun. Sure seems like it was a fair fight.\n\nThis idea of a fair fight only exists in sports.  In real life not much of anything is fair and if you are in a fight you think is for your life then purposely handicapping yourself in order to fulfill someone else's sense of fairness is stupid.
Saw my friend do that yesterday. Holy crap that was hilarious. 
The issue that exists as I understand the situation with the ACLU and gun rights is they apparently believe that the right to keep and bear arms is a collective right not an individual right.  Meaning they allow for an interpretation of the 2a that is ok with many forms of gun control that were it viewed as an individual right wouldn't be ok.\n\nI am sure I am giving a very base level description but as far as I know the ACLU is ok with things like requiring background checks for private sales, "assault weapons" and "high capacity magazine" bans as well as requiring permits and licenses for ownership which can be viewed as similar to requiring an ID to vote as it represents a financial and sometimes logistical burden towards exercising a right.\n\nI know there is a little resentment between much of the gun rights community and the ACLU and I believe it to be because they generally don't fight to protect the 2a as ardently as they do other right and in some cases allow for what many consider unconstitutional gun control laws to be passed without a fight.
> In what fucking universe is the 4th Circuit anti-gun?\n\nWell they ruled in direct opposition to established SCOTUS rulings using extremely weak and incorrect information so...  This universe?\n\n>I wish you guys would spend as much time actually learning the law around this issue that you can't stop talking about as you do memorizing minute details about gun specs and shit like that.\n\nAccording to the Heller decision any firearm in common legal usage is protected by the 2a.  Pretty cut and dry legal ruling from the fucking SCOTUS but apparently a lower court knows better according to you.\n\nMaybe you anti gun folk should learn more about the laws surrounding the issue....
Do you people honestly believe this?  If you do I regret to inform you of an incident in Bowling Green...
Wait is all of that the prize?  The ships, foam, token and alt art Ketsu are baller but the other upgrade cards as prizes confuse me.  Like were they just giving out random upgrade cards as prizes too?\n
Good god you are just disgusting and pathetic.\n\nSince this nation is beyond the 90% white that you love what would you do?  Deport people to countries they have never lived in based entirely on the color of their skin and your sense of entitlement?\n\nMaybe the Native Americans would look at that and take a cue from the white man...\n\nI'm done with you. You're a sad and hateful human being with no concept of history or morality and I hope to god you're just a troll because if not then god help us all if people like you are voting.  SAD!
I'd have killed Balon and Yara as they would never suspect it and taken the Salt Throne by paying the iron price for it then reinforce Robb under the understanding that after we win the war, the iron islands are their own kingdom again and me as king.
But same adults that can enlist in the military and be given more dangerous weapons to openly carry.\n
> And people don't think this government wants to be fascist...incredible...\n\nI'm very glad that the GOP has protected my gun rights from Democrats all these years.  Because of them I am most likely to need them for their intended purpose.
Police chiefs and government officials do that all the time and people consistently get pissed.  Have you not heard of how expensive and difficult it is to get a gun or a permit to carry a gun in many cities and states and how much people constantly complain about it like in CA, NYC, NJ, D.C. and elsewhere?\n\n\n\nIn fact there is massive outrage anytime anyone in an official position says that people shouldn't be able to exercise their 2a rights.  And a lot of those people also get pissed about the same thing being done to their other rights as well but you won't see them showing up to first amendment protests wearing cammo and carrying AR15s because that isn't the right that protest is about.
That was regarding citizenship not all travel into and out of the nation.
I feel like Zeb and Boshek on Heff Tober is a good combo.  
Only ship I would ever put it on would be Miranda with flechettes so she can regen a shield, dish out a stress and almost certainly keep the torp to do again.  Kind of a limited application but eh.
These guys are the equivalent of people who would stand on the street corner yelling "Nigger!" randomly as a means of exercising and protecting the first amendment.  Legal: yes.  Smart:  nope.
> I'm not entirely convinced that Shae did love him, more that she loved what he could give her (material wealth, semblance of a high class life, etc.).\n\nBut if she just wanted to live the high life why did she refuse the large bag of diamonds that Varys tried to give her to leave?
> but instituting universal licensing and background checks. Wanna buy a large capacity semi-auto handgun? Cool. But you should have to go to a safety course, get licensed, and have a thorough background check before buying. Maybe even have to register the weapon as well.\n\nProblem is that all costs $$ and effectively eliminates the ability of poor people to exercise a protected right.  Same reason poll taxes are unconstitutional should apply here.
\n\nSo if I buy a non assault version of the rifle then do I not require the license or class?  That would mean that simply adding a pistol grip, or a flash suppressor, or a bayonet lug would magically alter the function of the weapon to a point requiring a special training class and license...?  That is like saying you can drive your normal car with a normal license but if you tint the windows, put on spinning rims or add a rear spoiler, then you must register that as a racing car and require a special drivers license that require a yearly safety class and renewal...  That is absolutely retarded.\n\nAnd what if I already own scary assault weapons...  Do I now need a special class and license to keep owning things I have owned without issue for years?  \n\nDo people understand how ignorant and insulting this bill is or how full of BS the people pushing it are?  \n\n>and would fix what some call a loophole in the current law, which makes it easier to get an assault weapon than a handgun.\n\nThrough the entire article they never once actually say what the loophole is that lets someone get an "assault weapon" easier than a handgun.  They do not mention what this loophole is because it does not exist and is a flat out lie with as much truth to it as the Bowling Green Massacre.  \n\n>Democratic Rep. Laurie Jinkins of Tacoma, the sponsor of House Bill 1387, said her bill aims to prevent accidental and mass shootings in Washington state. Under the measure, a person would have to be 21 years old to purchase an assault weapon, would be required to undergo an expanded background check similar to those required for concealed weapons, attend an education course and go through the renewal process every year.\n\n>Jinkins said this topic is personal for her because a drive-by shooter shot at her nephew and his friends while walking home from school one day. She said he lived because he was on the other side of the street, but some kids aren’t so lucky.\n\nUnless the people who did that drive by shooting were under 21, using "assault weapons" and were unaware of safely using and storing their firearms I don't really see how these bills would have prevented that or similar drive by shootings. \n\n>Deputy prosecuting attorney Adam Cornell, told the group his worst day out of the 15 years working in Snohomish County was when he arrived at the scene where a 19-year-old, Allen C. Ivanov, shot and killed three of his former high school classmates at a house party in Mukilteo last year.\n\n>Authorities say Ivanov opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle he had just purchased. Ivanov pleaded guilty and has been sentenced to life in prison.\n\n>“That shooting, those murders,” he paused and said, “occurred in a span of less than 35 seconds … Assault weapons are the most efficient killers of people that we have in our communities.”\n\nAnd that exact same event could have been carried out with a 5 shot pump action shotgun that the same 19 year old would **STILL** be able to legally buy if this bill were passed.  If these weapons are the most efficient killers of people why do they account for literally the smallest number of people killed by guns?\n\n>Inslee said there’s a loophole in the state’s law that doesn’t require background checks for assault weapons.\n\nThat is again a **100% FLAT OUT LIE AND HE KNOWS IT**.  The only way someone can get a gun legally without a background check is if they are directly related to the other person giving them the gun.  And that is a caveat in the federal background check law that was specifically negotiated when the law was passed.  It is not a loophole it was a compromise like people ask for.  But apparently yesterdays compromise is tomorrows loophole and now you might understand why gun rights advocates tend to have the "never give an inch" attitude these days.\n\n>“It shouldn’t be so easy to get your hands on an assault rifle,” Cornell said. “The legislation proposed is responsible, it’s common sense and it will go far toward making sure the tragedy at Mukilteo never happens again.”\n\nIt is none of those things.  It still allows people to access firearms it just makes access to arbitrarily selected ones based entirely on cosmetic features more expensive and burdensome.\n\nIf you want gun control then use honest facts in your argument or else you're no better than the Trump administration that lies through its teeth about easily verifiable things to justify its unconstitutional emotion based actions.
Holy shit that is sad.
The part design hasn't changed in over 30 years. So nobody is interested in changing anything. The part will be made complete in one op on a mill/turn. I can spin the c-axis at about 200rpm which would probably be ok for the material (52100) and the geometries involved. I know people do this on cnc lathes, it's actually a selling point with some machine tool builders. So there is no question about that. I just wanted to have a conversation with someone that has experience with it.
>"We believe, in the absence of any other information being developed, that unfortunately this is a tragic, unfortunate accidental shooting," Butler told The Florida Times-Union (http://bit.ly/2kC9l3y ). He added that the mother of the girl had left to go to a store at the time.\n\n>Police said 34-year-old Maurice Antonio Mobley, the mother's boyfriend, was arrested after he turned himself in and charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\n>Sheriff's office spokesman Officer Christian Hancock said in a news release that police believe Mobley brought the gun into the house.\n\nOh a convicted felon had a gun and was left alone with children...  Whats the worst that can happen?
They should wear their red shirts and brown pants.
I want to see Stark reunions.  I want to see Jon and Arya and Jon and Bran especially but Arya and Sansa would be great too.\n\nFor so long the Starks have been down and the pack separated but like Ned told Arya in S1 the pack survives when it stays together and with Winter here I feel like thematically the Stark pack should get back together for the final parts of the story even if they end up parting ways for whatever reasons.
I don't think that is the case at all.  Everyone I know is more up to date on politics now than at any time before and it seems more people now than in recent memory are actively engaging in the political process of contacting their representatives when they want action and are publicly demonstrating to display their dissatisfaction.  I mean in less than a month he has lost cabinet members, been implicated in legit treason and election rigging and has the lowest approval rating like ever along with active talks on impeachment.\n\nI'd say we are sticking it to the motherfuckers and we shouldn't let up even if we start to feel like its not working.  It is working and the crazier they act the more you know it is working.  \n\nWhen your opponent is mad they will make mistakes because they make decisions based on emotion instead of logic and eventually the weight of their own mistakes will crush them.  All we have to do is continue to put pressure on them, call out their BS, contact our representative government and fight the bastards back.  They will continue to make mistakes until they inevitably make a fatal one and then they are done.\n\nTo quote a great ships captain...\n\n"NEVER GIVE UP!  NEVER SURRENDER!"\n\n
That is what "they" want you to do which is why they are inundating you with this shit.  They want you to feel helpless and to tune out because that means you won't be paying attention or protesting when they do the horrible things they want to do.
I do have a feeling though the reason he doesn't is because if he tries to explain it he's going to come off sounding like [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-1_9-z9rbY)
You don't need to nor do you want to wet the entire pot at this point.\nJust keep the center moist. If its drying to quick put a glass upside down over the center.
You guys need to stop giving that thing exposure. If it wasn't for posts like this I would have no idea what it thought or tweeted.

I estimate machined parts and assemblies for a living. \nThere are companies that send me tons of work, no problem paying bills, and for that reason they will never be thrown under a bus for a person that's looking for a one time one off job, especially someone I don't know. That said I still do some low quantity work but usually I can put it through my prototype department. I can just throw a print at them and I don't need the job to go through a bunch of functional departments like engineering and programming. But basically they have an hourly rate and a lot of one offs you're looking at 3 or 4 hours min usually. Having not seen your mold design, if it involves a complex cavity deeper than 1.5" that needs to have <8 RMS you're going to pay no matter where you go. You're looking for a guy that is working in his garage, and willing to work for $30 an hour, and has nothing better to do. Of course he has no CMM and is as far from ISO as you can possibly be. 
There's an old Union Carbide plant just around the bend.
To grow herbs yeah. To grow weed no.
bake him cookies or something, offer him 10 bucks for gas at least.
w/e dude I ride the rct a few times a week to work. I see a dozen junkies every day getting to or from the methadone clinic. I'm on a first name basis with a bunch of them. It's a great slice of life every Vermonter should experience. Most of them are not from Vermont either. Also when I'm on it I'm one of two people riding it to get to a job. All the rest are either going to get methadone or social services of some kind. It would almost make for a good situation comedy though it may be too dark for sensitive viewers. I would have to name it for the bus, which I call the Bipolar express.
Realize it's the 49th least populous state out of 50 and there is very little in the way of employment. There are a lot of people in Vermont already that wished they had a job.
Rihanna in the sauna. 
WTF Canada!!!
yeah I forgot about the weight lifting accident. Nothing tells potential stoolies to stfu like one stoolie getting his wind pipe crushed to death as an example.
Now that you did that it should start growing/flowering again in a couple of weeks. The reason you don't want to fuck with auto's is because it takes time for a plant to recover from something like topping. Since auto's are only going to be around for 8-9 weeks losing 2 or more of those weeks will have a significant impact on production. With photos you can keep them in veg forever so recovery time isn't an issue.
Nice try DEA.
Never seemed to stop Barry 
They are looking pretty western and are reaching an age where that's going to start becoming a problem for them. Just sayin.\n\nedit: I guess that picture is a few years old. would be interesting to see what they look like now in terms of how they dress or even if they're still alive.
Fight back or be destroyed.
No boats or FLYOVERS allowed, for safety. \nSafety and security seems like a frequently used excuse to censor our view of reality. \n
The seed went in the ground 11/7/16. As with every auto I've ever seen it started showing sex at 21 days after sprouting.

What I have a problem with is being forced under the penalty of law to pay money to a private company. Period for any reason. If we want to run a social program like health care, because that's exactly what it is, then it should be single payer. I don't mind paying a little towards my neighbors kids medical problems, what I do mind is some guy in a suit skimming a 25 million annual salary off the top.
The security of the republic is at stake. The moment when government is transitioned is when it's at it's most vulnerable. We take this seriously.
Agreed. Just make it legal and stop trying to regulate the fuck out of it. One day we'll look back at these times and realize how ridiculous marijuana prohibition is. At least that's what I've been telling myself for the last 40+ years.
Everybody has gotten used to it, that's the problem.
he didn't even score the touchdown, it was the guy standing next to him.

Never ask a toddler a question, just tell them what you want them to do. e.g. "are you ready for bed?". Correct way is "It's time for bed". You'll both be much happier that way.

70lbs per square inch of surface to surface contact. It can actually be more like 100lbs/sq.in depending upon the flatness and the finish.
That assumes that cannabis impairs driving. There is no such proof of that in fact studies have shown the contrary. 
why not just ban then? oh right it's better to be sneaky and deceitful. 
The best smelling auto I ever grew. I have two of these one is about 5-6 days faster than the other. This pic is the slower one. The other ones been flushed out and I'm just waiting for it to dry out for another day or so.
Because we're the biggest nanny state out of 50. Methadone clinics, free transportation to and from, general assistance, free health care, free meal sites, soup kitchens, pawn shops, etc etc. It's like Disney world for junkies here. If I was a junkie anywhere I'd want to come here. 
Is this pizza related?
What a good looking group of people.
Hey Bob! Yeah still all fluorescent lights. No changes, we've got this down to a very simple science. Good seeds, 5gal smart pots, promix, Advanced Nutrients sensi ph perfect (don't even own a ph meter) grow/bloom and all the rest of the AN line, T5's 6500k,3000k mix 95w bulbs, and patience. 
> P480:no spec.:milling\n\nalmost sounds like you're trying to program in polar and don't have that on the machine.\n\n
At first I thought the same. It seemed like the yellow car was in between lanes moving from right to left. But when you look it's possible he was already in the left lane and was trying to avoid the guy crossing the solid white line and was moving to the right instead but there was a car there so the yellow car had to hit one of them.\nPersonally I would never feel comfortable flying along at full speed just beside two lanes of standing traffic when the only thing separating us is someone elses patience.

Do they really have influence that they can still peddle? 
You can tell by Hillary's reaction exactly what he's doing.
I must be a hipster cause I've hated her forever. I can't remember the last movie I saw that she was in, but I'm sure it was boring and pretentious. 
I've only heard them called Vermont windows. I think it's just cause we wanted to maximize the light we could get in the winter.
Funny how they can only examine themselves and determine that now is the moment they will start behaving like true journalists. It only took them 40 years to come to that realization. It's just more of the same old shenanigans. A leopard doesn't change it's spots. They only play the ignorant game when the establishment elite are in positions of power. When anybody other than establishment elite are in the white house they suddenly decide to start becoming investigative journalists. 
It just demonstrates that they are really just two sides of the same coin.
You are starting to sound like that character in like half the movies. But we're better than that, we won't stoop to their level. I say fuck that let the bodies hit the floor.
From your description I'm having a little trouble envisioning exactly what you're trying to do. A u shaped channel in the end of a .02 tube with a .125 endmill. Can you show a pic of what its supposed to look like or even better a print with dimensions?
It also means Barry won't be riding in it again any time soon.
big bud, bud candy, b-52, final flush. maybe a little cal mag depending on your water.\nnext time go with the sensi grow/bloom.
It's either thing one or thing two.

My problem with Rick Perry is that he reminds me too much of Moe from the three stooges. 
That's when you should say, not only are you not going to be full time, we don't want you here at all. GTFO
do you want it to suffice or grow out the auto to it's full potential?\nBut beware of those numbers, you want true at the outlet wattage not some "equivalent" wattage bullshit.
Do you need to use the tent?
Which the ph perfect? Yeah it actually works ...perfectly.\n
That pic was from a few days ago. They started 11-7-16. I've since cut them both down as of today. They are amazing I love them. I like them because not only did they produce rock hard fabulously crystally, deliciously fruity smelling nugs. They did it relatively quickly and kept themselves nice and compact without any branches or many leaves as you can see there. Cleaning is a breeze. I just trimmed them up right in their pots standing there. They are just solid mass standing there all swollen and smelly. I estimate 3-4 oz ea dry. Can't wait (but will) to smoke some. If it smokes anywhere near as good as it looks and smells I'll be happy.
1 5gal smart pot. A bag of Promix bx or bh. AN sensi gro a&b, sensi bloom a&b. A light source capable of producing about 400 real watts. Water. A seed. \nNow if you have to be stealthy and need a tent you'll need ventilation. So the tent + fan and filter will add quite a bit of cost if you have to go that route. Also noise and sheer ass pain with the heat and less access.
It's still going to affect the petition. People would rather add their name to a list of thousands than a list of one.
how many hours a day are they on?
how ironic that you didn't ignore me to make such a statement
No I guess I'm going by all the posts on reddit of things like here's a picture of my mom in Iran in the 70's before the Islamic revolution (shown wearing western clothes) and here she is last week (full burka). 
It's ironic that the illegality of cannabis makes it's users obey the rest of the laws more carefully. While those that don't break several of them every day without a thought.
don't mind him he's been watching tv all his life.
which one do you like the best out of those?
I think if you've never grown weed before you should get a seed, some soilless mix, nutes, and the best light you can afford. Keeping shit simple works best.
I think of a country who's total population is less than that of the state of Texas, sprinkled around the periphery of a largely uninhabitable wasteland of a continent. This is not a knock against Australia, I love Australians. It's just the first think I think of.
Since when did the president need permission to tap someone's phone?
Why doesn't someone break out the emails and ask him about specific cryptic references and what was really meant by them. You know sort of give us the logical explanation of what they were "really" talking about. No one every directly addresses the content of the emails with him publically. If he really is innocent and this is all a misunderstanding than he can clear it all up once and for all and the problem goes away. 
At least it means they read it. 
She hadn't written one. That and she was in too much of a drunken rage to be brought out. Also she cried so much that her tears washed off the many layers of makeup, revealing her reptilian skin.

This. Exactly fucking this.
Some really old woman with inter-cortical vascular dementia who they had to sling into her ambulance van like a side of beef. 
It's hard for you to get a real sense of what the average American thinks if your only source is via MSM. MSM right now is about 180 degrees out of phase with reality. Most of us feel the same as you which is why he's the president. It's confusing only because status quo elites that control all media (not just in the USA), are trying to put forth a different narrative because they are not liking reality at the moment. They are trying really hard though.
The reason I ask is because I keep mine within a few inches of the bulbs. I can do this because I don't use a tent and fans blow any heat from the lights away from the plants. Have you grown other autos in that setup before?
That assumes marijuana impairs driving.
What form of payment did you use?
He should be banned from participation in any collegiate sport for the rest of his sorry life.
Why do we keep giving this .. thing coverage? Ignore her and she will go away like her mom did.
-Hillary Clinton
the 300 will suffice. Understand this though. When you reduce the intensity of the light source, it's not that you'll simply get less buds, it's that the quality will be affected. If you want good quality rock hard buds, glistening with crystals, then you need max light. You can cut back on everything else and have less affect than cutting back on light power. If you pay whatever the extra is to go from 300 to 400, but that increase means you get 4 ounces instead of 2 it may be economically dumb not to. Especially when you consider the time it takes to get the next crop in jars. If it means you have an endless supply of weed vs having to jones for a few weeks because you're not producing enough per grow to maintain your head, well that's something to think about.
Lights?
My guess is you don't have enough RPM on a live tool that small in brass.
I've only gotten one bad seed for them so far. With the genetics being what they are, auto and feminized we have to expect a weird mutation from time to time. But every other seed I was impressed with. I think they outperform pretty consistently from what I'm seeing. I don't like to buy too many strains from any one breeder cause I superstitiously believe that I'll get more of a difference in strains if they also come from entirely different sources. So I was quite apprehensive initially about fastbuds since they were brining out an auto of like every popular strain there is. But so far from strain to strain they seem to have the phenotype of whatever it is they are saying it is, as an auto version. [7] 
So....make a under class of non-citizens laborers with few rights that directly compete with our most vulnerable citizens.  Sounds like the status quo.
I can't validate your desire for a culturally homogeneous planet.  Lots of weight and force in "Ought" that most folks don't want to think about.

There likely is a government sanctioned alcohol cartel in Mexico.
Yes.  They are arresting people who post anything anti-refugee on social media.
Not in North America.   NA has vast amounts of land dedicated to agriculture and we are nowhere near carrying capacity.\n\nSEA, China, India, ME and Africa are different stories.   A soon to be deadly mix of environmental damage bringing the capacity down, a population boom and agricultural tech 150 years behind western nations.\n\nIt's so bad that the Clean Water Act is now a strategic advantage to the US over China.
Be sure to check their immigration status when you arrest them.  Start some shit on a visa, get the boot.
Next time there is a constitutional convention....you will not like the results.
This is a strategy the left is now using to bully Republican reps.  Rush called it a few days ago.
I don't know how sucking the factories out of Japan to SEA will help them.
Note: T1 armor is pretty effective for the low cost.  It takes all the way to T5 to double effectiveness at 5 times the cost of T1.  So if you're looking for a cheap defence on a throw away unit T1 Armor is relevent.
The "liberal" left has been slowly trying to normalize certain sexualities, like pedophilia and beastiality.  It seems more than a few people in power are pedophiles and have a taste for beastiality.  Certain voters blocks are also ok with arranged marriages at such young ages and this form of animal abuse.
They already have the model for infinite money.   App+driverless electric taxis.

Put up an fronteer outpost on your own home star and see what happens.\n\nThen put your best scientist in society, society research grant, free thought, and burn for border range tech.   then when a star flips put a outpost/colony(not if it's a holy world!) in it.

Note:  Nuclear reactor used steam turbines to generate electricity.  Steam so hot and so high pressure that it is considered "dry steam".\n\nThis is where you get the stories of pin-hole leaks cutting broom handles (and limbs) in half on US CVNs.
ICE officials frequently use high capacity passenger vans to detain deportees when they raid a site.
Can you imagine the KKK having international following and funding. 
No, it isn't.  It's the history of civilization and before.  There is hard force behind every rule and regulation.  We all are so used to it, we don't even think about it.\n\nThink about ignoring something seeming harmless like defaulting on a car loan by $5 and how it escalates to potentially lethal force if you refuse to comply.
I can not wrap my mind how stateless communism is supposed to work with a group of more then five likeminded people.
Why would we want to extend out a hand to the same bunch that ruined Europe?  Especially now we are winning, with a POTUS that actually loves campaigning.

Trump's former companies makes us to the H-2B visa, the legal way to import seasonal labor.

This will have unintended consequences for silicon valley.  Many Corperation use private contractor personnel transportation services to ferry their employees about.   Not to mention the various religious organizations that do the same for their parishioners' children.
I'd be fine with drone striking a few cartel heads and leveling their lavish blood money funded homes.   Also rooting out their money launders by means of finance investigation and fraud charges.\n\nWe can turn these cartels into the same types of cave people afraid of sunny days we did other terrorist organizations.

You would do more "damage" with the shield debuff...   hitting them with -25% shield HP is really nasty.... it's like 500 to 2500 HP in a second.
Military Stations can shut down offensives while enemies fleets the pre-5k range.  Just put a shield dampener tanky one in front of your spaceport and a snare at the edge of that range.\n\nThe spaceport gets some nasty firepower as it's upgraded with better base weapons tech and levels.  The snared fleet gets hit with the shield dampener for an instant 25% shield HP reduction to all ships.   This will be hundreds to thousands of HP in "damage".\n\n

Clinton's loss is because she is a candidate that doesn't inspire enthusiasm.   Most states have early or remote voting in some form or another.  The people that didn't show up to vote for her in critical states did so by making a conscious decision not to vote at all or not vote for her.

Because people pretend he's the worst thing ever and literally Hitler for no reason. Because people think beating up and harassing and calling people names because they support a candidate you don't. (hapened many times to Trump supporters.) Because people say things like this just because it's Trump. I was vehemently opposed to Obama for eight years. We think the Left is absurd largely because we just put up with a president we didn't like for eight years and we didn't act like this. The protests and talk like this? No when someone said something like this about Obama more people would say that's disrespectful of the office and rude. Liberals clamor on here and say they'd punch him in the face. The attitude towards Trump because of what? Because they were told he's a racist and everything else. No other reason. Because people aren't thinking for themselves. That is why Trump won. It helped drive many of us to Trump. I voted for Evan McMullin but if the riots and protests happened on November 7th instead of 9th, I would have voted for Trump. \n\nIf I met Obama I would shake his hand and take a picture with him. I oppose 99% of what he's done and his policies but he was the president. I respect that he was the president. I couldn't do it. In fact I've done this before. I live in NY and when I was playing with the steel drum band in school we played at the State Fair. Chuck Schumer (#NotMySenator) was there and guess what? I shook his hand and got my picture with him then told him something. I got told "you're way out there, kid" (which my parents were appalled a sitting Senator would tell a minor) but guess what? I was perfectly respectful of him and sure didn't kick him. \n\nThis attitude and mentality that Trump = worst thing ever I literally can't even is why Trump won. We thought it was ridiculous and a party that was totally divided by him got driven behind him by it. 
Finally a non-political joke that's even funny. 
Mohammed is already long dead. 
I actually agree with this and I was definitely not a Trump fan during the entire election. \n\nMy mom and myself went to Sean Hannity's townhall with Cruz in Binghamton, NY in May, the week before our primary. He stuck around for pictures and questions and we attempted to get in line to meet him. We would have, if people could use their heads and didn't make two extra lines... And of course the last one to be made is the one that ended up actually getting to him. If the original line stayed the real line, I was going to ask him "WHat will you do to appeal to general election voters?" because I've been a huge fan since he was elected... Wanted him to run for president in 2014 then realized that he would never win... Of course now Trump is president and I think he would have won big if he was the nominee. If Trump can win it then Cruz could... But yeah I think Cruz isn't exactly the type for president. It'd be fun to see him in the debates, but as president I think there's better candidates... This is why I was a Rubio supporter. While I agree with Cruz on just about everything policy wise and think he speaks best for me, I thought someone like Rubio or Kasich would be better as president because they're a little more to the center.
Whatever else Elizabeth Warren tells you to think.
You know the Obama-Clinton foreign policy is why Russia is the savior of Syria right? Is why Russia is screwing around all over the world. Is why ISIS was able to boom and grow into large swaths of land. Is why Iran freely violates sanctions and the Iran deal. Obama's failed foreign policy and failed leadership is why ISIS exists the way it does. Obama was a horrible president and history will not look on him kindly. I know all my fellow millenials seem to think he was some amazing president but seriously... You're just ignoring literally everything remotely negative. Which isn't hard mind you, it's not your fault that the media clocked out for 8 years. He made the world a less safe place and that's not exaggerating. Obama was a terrible president. Objectively speaking he simply was not good. Sorry ideas don't make fact. Actual results judge Presidents. Obama had poor results. \n\nThe man literally said he should be one term president because he didn't fix the economy in four years. He said that himself in 2008 or 2009. He presided over the slowest economic recovery in eons. Obama was a bad president. Objectively. 
I'm sure he'll take in and pay for refugees, right...? \n\nGod forbid we not inject liberal politics into everything FFS. 
You're an idiot. The Secret Service would arrest you immediately. 
Well if the Democrats nominate someone who people actually like or want maybe. Trump was lucky it was Hillary. The two worst candidate in history and no one had a proper choice. \n\nBut then again if I learned anything in 2012 it's that an incumbent no matter how bad has a pretty good chance to start with. So yeah. \n\nI don't think he'll ether survive or be healthy enough to run again though. That's my hope so I can get a good conservative Republican maybe. 
Adults do not have freedom to choose something that isn't even healthy for you when you're in poverty and getting government welfare. Sorry. The point isn't so you have all the food you would ever want. It's so you have food so you don't go starve and die. \n\nAlso one reason there probably aren't many grocery stores in these areas is because that would make it not very profitable. That's how business works. 
Hahahahaha this guy thinks those evil rednecks Bill Clinton grew up with are all racist hillbillies. \n\nIt's hilarious to me the intolerance of the left.  
Man if we said this kind of stuff about Obama....... \n\nIf you really think this... Well you're retarded.  
I would've loved to see him in the debates against Hillary... But as a president? Nah. Would've rather seen other people. That's the reason I was a Rubio supporter not a Cruz supporter.
There's no way I'd queue for a ranked match knowing I was muted most of the time.... Which is why I'd like to know if I am in the first place. 
I can stop your breath, leave you paralyzed, end your heartbeat, take you to the brink of death and pull you back to life. (Anesthesiologist)
That's an interesting contradiction considering how much he said the term "access" to Cruz in the CNN debate a couple weeks ago....\n\nNice of Bernie and Obama and his Democrat pals to make Obamacare so affordable that people can't afford healthcare. ROFL.
Lol. I just read a comment on something on the front page that was a comment basically the Jews and Israel for the travel ban. Like really. I forgot how antisemitic liberals were because we've only been talking about black white, Hispanic and Arabs. It's amazing to me how antisemitic they are. What did the Arabs do to get them so on their side? 
Well if you read stories of people who worked for him you'd know a long time ago that the media narrative is absolute bullshit. He's apparently a great man as a person. He just has a stage persona/outward character that he puts on display. This is immensely obvious to anybody who actually pays attention beyond what the media tells them. It's very sad how no one is thinking for themselves let alone at all when it comes to Trump. Very very sad. The Dems and media made such a narrative that they have to get up. He's the racist evil bully nevermind that we can't really tell you how. Ridiculous. And after 8 years of saying \n nothing about Obama... 
Can confirm the edit: am post-election self-identified Trump supporter: I blew air out of my nose.
You can't wait for someone to get arrested? 
So the problem is that he used a phrase everyone misinterpretated and so he should lose his career because everyone misinterpretated it? \n\nLet's be honest... It's only because he's a conservative and worse: a Nazi homophobe Trump supporter. That's the truth. If anyone else said this we wouldn't even know about it. \n\nWhat a great country we're turning into... 
Bernie's Dream? Kappa
Or they just didn't consider it something they thought needed to necessarily be public and archived it....?? \n\nNot everything is nefarious ffs. I guess I missed that memo the past 8 years. That I was supposed to say how terribly unethical literally everything Obama did was. Oh well.  
My favorite part of that was how she asked how she could pay for it without raising prices or **lowering wages**. His confusion on that made me laugh and then shake me head in disgust at how he so clearly knows **LITERALLY NOTHING** about economics.
While I as a Republican said he won't be nominated.... I don't honestly believe he will LITERALLY last four years. As in survive. I figured he'll have a heart attack or something. He is not a healthy guy. 
It's kind of sad and shows how ignorant most people are.... Because I've heard over and over again how great it is working for him and with him. He's a great employer apparently. But most people have just been told how crappy he is and racist and this and that by Democrat talking heads and so think that what he's like. It's kind of sad, because as a person he's apparently a great guy. 
I mean until the whole fake news thing came out I didn't even know Buzzfeed did "real" news let alone had a White House correspondent? (at least I think they do? Do they? See how much I know about Buzzfeed)  \n\nFor some reason I always thought they were just a site for crappy memes or something. 
Because they're not lesbians... Which don't really exist.
Well I doubt he uses that land by now. 
He meant the hating on Trump. It's a term that is apparently now being used to refer to people saying things like he did about the refugee policy. People making a political statement about something Implying they're caring so much about the people in that situation when most likely they usually don't really. 
Thanks Obama. 
If you weren't just drowning in Trump kool-aid for the primary you'd like him before.\n\nThat's the part all us #NeverTrumpers (former here) didn't understand at all. Cruz was what you were looking for. We all assumed when Trump dropped out you guys would all jump to Cruz. Of course, that never happened and Cruz vs Trump remained the final two and their supporters ended up despising each other... Which was funny because you guys all wanted the same thing really.\n\nCruz has been speaking out about draining the swamp longer than Trump. Cruz has been a total thorn in the side of both the establishment and media for a while now.
Rofl. Obama was a bad president. Talk to anyone outside your bubble. Of course he wasn't a fascist. We said he was a socialist. Durr. Trump isn't a fascist either. Do you even know what fascism is? \n\nYes, Obama had dozens of scandals and *he* never fired *anyone*. IRS, Iran deal, Benghazi, war in Libya, VA scandal, Fast and Furious and more. You just all nicely ignore that.   \n\nAlso Vox of all places literally has an article on why Trump isn't a fascist and the difference between fascism and populism. Google it. Don't be ignorant.   
> And he was right. \n\nNo. But the Democrats sure could do anything and still get as many votes apparently, given that Hillary actually did something and people still voted for her.... Trump says a lot of dumb, hyperbolic things. If you think he's serious when he says these things you should learn English.
I mean as a Republican it is funny to me. We've been saying crap like this about anything. Dog pooped on the floor? The Russians did it. Spilled my dink? Russians. Etc. \n\nBecause the Russians ruining the election is a dumb bullshit conspiracy theory. (inb4 downvotes) Hence we find it funny. I laughed at this joke.  
>Neocon. \n\nAs someone who also repeatedly said he was moderate until our primary in NY when I voted for him: have you read his record as governor? He's actually done some fantastically conservative things. The man defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio the right way: rotate it around to the bottom of the list under all the pro-life, non abortion-providing organizations so they can't whine as much about it. Did a lot of very conservative things at least by reading his Wiki article. 
Yep. That's what I learned in 2012.
No. They archived it. People just want to be upset and outraged that Trump is deleting things when he's not. Obama changed the website to his ideology too. Not sure why this is *sooo* horrible. God forbid someone have different policies than my party... 
Eh. Let's be real if you're a liberal you don't have to do anything. If you're a conservative you have to do it all and it's 10x harder with you guys calling us racists every step of the way because we dare to think different.
It's kind of funny how the spoon fed libbies seriously seem to believe that Trump supporters are what the narratives you eat up tell you. \n\nMaybe you should get out of yours house and out of your precious bubble and meet people who disagree with you. You might quickly find out who Trump supporters really are. \n\nAnd I was not one until the reaction to his victory.  I voted against him twice. Don't see me pretending everyone's a racist. 
Sure.\n\nThe things you guys say about Trump is so amusing. I guess you were just as outraged when Obama's IRS was targeting political opponents? Or when he told the Russians he would have more flexibility after the election? Or they admitted to lying about the Iran deal so the public wouldn't disapprove? \n\nNo? You weren't as upset? Yeah I figured. Most of you don't even know about this stuff. Sad. 
Is that why Mohammed killed people of the book and said to? \n\nDownvoted to hell in seconds I'm sure.  
Why? \n\nSerious question. As a conservative I'd be ecstatic to have President Pence. I wanted a real conservative and didn't get it (thanks Trump ffs) and would love it if Trump was out. \n\nI see comments like this on everything political on reddit. Why? What exactly do you actually KNOW that is SO horrifying about Pence? That's an honest question. Do you actually know how he was as a governor or are you just repeating talking points you've been told by the Democrats? 
Archived. 
> just because you post more news on refugee committed crime won't make it some enormous problem\n\nWooooow. Nice. So because you don't want it to be a fact means it doesn't happen? Dude. This is a fact  everyone knows it. If you're not too stuck pushing your narrative then you know: sex crime and other crime but largely sex crime is SOARING in Europe because of refugees. There is no other reason. Are you seriously ignoring this and pretending it isn't a problem because it doesn't fit your world view? That's pretty sad, buddy.
This is the part that drives me insane. When people like my uncle (aide for Pocahontas fml.) say crap like nothing was found or she hasn't been convicted.... We literally all know. It's universal common knowledge that Hillary destroyed and tampered with evidence. That's illegal. \n\nI'm so glad she lost.  I didn't vote for Trump and I didn't call myself a Trump supporter until the riots and hysteria happened but I was glad he won if for no other reason then the precedent it would set if Hillary won. Like really. Horrible. SAD! 
We can. Because people acting like whiney ignorant idiots constantly repeating talking points they heard and going around pretending it's okay to act uncivilized and just generally like an asshole to anyone who isn't a Bernie or Hillary living Democrat is acceptable. Because people going around talking like as if it's the end of the world calling him and his supporters ALL racist and a basket of deplorables. This hate politics helped drive support for him because people don't like that kind of behavior. We don't just go and call people every name in the book without substance because we don't like the candidate they like. This is America. \n\nSo this IS how Trump won.  I voted for Evan McMullin. I would have voted without hesitation for Trump if the protests and riots and whining happened November 7th instead. 
Here let met do that to Obama. Oops I'm a racist now. 
But the notion here is that if you don't hate Trump you're a horrible person. I would know this as a Republican who didn't vote for him. I just want people o think objectively about him. No one does. If I criticize bullshit I get downvoted on and shit on. People don't want to think. They want to be told what to think.  
In NY they did a pretty decent job I think at getting rid of them. We have boxes that attract them and such. The problem has died down a lot. 
I have a Ben Carson sticker on my car. I wanted him as soon as I saw him at the prayer breakfast trashing Obamacare in front of Obama. I wanted Carson until the debates, then it became so obvious he wasn't very great with policy. Then I became 100% behind Rubio until he dropped out. After that I wanted Kasich then Cruz, because Kasich had the biggest chance of winning. Kasich would have won in a landslide and all the polls even showed that he would have won big. I knew Cruz wouldn't have any appeal to moderates.\n\nOf course I just watched in horror as Trump won every primary. Then on November 8th I got to watch in glee as Trump won. Lul.
Yeah fuck those crackers! They come in here and dare to think differently than I do and vote for different people! Fuck white people!
News to me Reddit even equated ISIS and Islam. What the heck are you reading? The Reddit I see would downvote me for calling them Muslim.
Yeah. It's kind of funny to me how they seem to be trying to push a narrative (using the code word for "muh single-payer", the word "access") about this being about some kind of policies.... No. It's just about health choices of our population mostly. We are unhealthy AF.
"if I don't fix the economy in four years I'll be a one term president." -  Barack Obama. \n\nSo yeah
Sorry being starving in a first world county does not give you a license to punch people in the nose for no reason. 
It's a funny day when people proclaim like a college professor that it's not reliable when in fact that has been proven otherwise by actual studies. (Google it) 
Not be a celebrity. 
Thanks to the Russians. \n\nThanks Obama for such horrible leadership across the world. Russia expanding their influence and looking like the good guys. Nice. 
You do realize that measuring Trump's approval ratings immediately after taking office is literally meaningless? How can you measure approval so soon after the most nasty election? When half the country has had it drilled into them that he is a racist and everything else? You can't measure anything. Wait a few months maybe. People aren't saying they disapprove of his presidency. They disapprove of him because the election just happened and was nasty. If Hillary was president it'd be the same thing. This is a horrible way to claim anything. 
Well he wouldn't try to kill their career. There's the difference. Milo would troll them and mock them (maybe. Possibly not given his experience. Watch enough of his videos and you'll see he's really not a horrible guy at all.) but he sure wouldn't go in a campaign to deliberately end their career over something dumb. \n\nUnlike liberals, conservatives don't try to censor everything they disagree with. 
All my games with mutes I ask to stop spamming if they keep doing it then I know they're muted. I usually ask and get another well played back. They're muted. 
And this is why conservatives don't believe in FEDERAL government programs.... 
Except that's he's not actually part of the inner circle. There's two factions in the White House. The Trump branch of anti-establishment types like Bannon, and the establishment/politician branch with people like Pence and Priebus. I do not believe Pence is a part of the "inner circle" in reality. Look at the VP debate. Pence is his own man. He was totally separating himself from Trump. He literally was not in the loop about some things during the campaign at least and clearly now still. Pence is not the inner circle. \n\nAlso don't equate Trump with Pence or any other Republican really either. Even Jeff Sessions. The second Trump is gone they won't care. 
Acts like what? Archiving the data from the old administration?\n\nIf the Democrats took over the government and Trump was before them wouldn't you expect and I imagine WANT them to get rid of the stuff you didn't consider a priority or agree with?\n\nIf you think about it this way it might make a lot more sense to you guys. Sorry not everyone has the same views as you do.   Obama did this too.   
>checking to see that the blowers were turned off \n\nWell it would seem there were blowers and they definitely weren't turned off...
The Clintons?  
I'm a conservative who would agree with you in most cases.... But somehow I think scamming people for a living when you live in Syria doesn't make you a shit person. That's an awful poor measure of character given what's going on there to begin with. Lul. In Syria being a shit person is joining ISIS. 
But it's interesting history to have. There's nothing bad about having a historical artifact of any kind. 
"Wrong!"  \n\nYeah some of my most enjoyable games are when I'm muted but also some of my most avoidable losses. I remember one game I was muted and it was fine except that we had an AM who never saved buyback and he attempted to solo push a rax where he barely did any damage to the T3 and we lost everything. That lost us the game. I was desperately wishing I could tell him to TP back but no. \n\nThose times are the worst. Yes it's often enjoyable to play ranked muted so you literally can't talk to the retards, but sometimes rewards need a little prodding to do the right thing. 
Look at who your party nominated before you say you're ashamed at Trump... Rofl.\n\nGuess what I was saying eight years ago?
Sorry I must have missed the part where the president tells the Russians that he'll have more flexibility after the election. Nope. That was Obama. \n\nSo far the only real scandalous part of this is that Flynn lied to Pence. If you want a good explanation of this fact to YouTube and find Ben Shapiro's show about this. I think it was the one uploaded yesterday. As he points out there's nothing scandalous about the incoming security advisor talking to a Russian official. The problem is he lied. Obama did far worse. Obama literally promised the Russians flexibility after he won the election. Sorry I think that's a much bigger scandals that sure wasn't covered like this. 
My dad works a the premier cancer center in the world. He often befriends his patients and helped a family through their daughters diagnosis and treatment of i believe leukemia. She was a young girl and it was pretty devastating when she stopped responding to the treatment. Its just incredible to see someone still get emotionally vested and work so hard to help people he hardly knows. I see him go through it about twice a year. Its inspiring to know that after twenty or so years he hasn't become cold or numb to it all. 
As a #NeverTrumper until November 9th when the riots happened and I quickly became a Trump supporter...\n\nNo. Cruz demolished Trump on substance. The problem was Trump needed *no substance at all* to win votes. The man did not win a campaign, he just won voters. Cruz destroyed everybody on that stage over and over again. He was, in fact, the best debater. You just can't debate with someone who is only up there to yell at people and shut them down. That's what Trump did. Cruz and Rubio both went on to debate.\n\nI still believe that if Trump didn't pussy out and skip the last debate because "we've had enough debates" (Fuck you Trump. I was looking forward to seeing that whole debate live for once.) that he might've ended up losing. I still believe he was afraid of debating Cruz and Kasich without anyone else. Trump was good in a group because he stood out. With only three people on stage, one of which is the best debater and has the whole entire conservative wing in his pocket, and then one other guy who's appealing to just about everyone else in the country and has common sense on his side? Yeah don't think Trump would do all that great in that debate setting. Smart move on his part to pussy out of it... But I still hate him for it because I really wanted to see it live.\n\nAnyways, point being: To say Cruz wasn't prepared for Trump is just ridiculous. Go back and watch the debates. Donald Trump never once got anyone good on substance or policy. He had some fantastic one-liners and gotcha's if he was debating on Youtube comments, but in a presidential debate? Nope. He basically just attracted more attention to himself. That is, in fact, how he ended up winning so much and propelling himself to the top: saying ridiculous things, getting attention, getting his face on TV (genius), and then getting free airtime and coverage. Same thing at the debates. Constantly yelling at people and shutting them down while they try to actually debate so that he gets more face-time and talk time. It worked, apparently. \n\nI think the only reason this sub is suddenly surprised at Cruz is because you were all told he's "Lyin' Ted!" for months and ate it right up. Cruz has always been like this. This is the guy who literally read a bedtime story to his kids on CSPAN on the floor of the Senate to filibuster. 
YUSSSS TRUMP FASCIST I KNOW DAT BECAUSE DUH MEDIA TOLD ME SO REEEEEE
Doesn't means she's ethnically Jewish. If someone is referred to as half Jewish then they sure don't mean religiously. If you're religiously Jewish then how can you be half Jewish? \n\nI am half Jewish. I'm a Christian but my mom's side of the family is 1000% Jewish... Ethnically. 
If he said CNN instead of Breitbart you would still ignore it...  \n\nAnd there are reputable sources in there. If you cared you would notice.   TIL Harvard isn't reputable. 
It is to me.  \n\nMaybe it identifies as a joke and you offended it. Triggered. 
Because you would expect either either of the two least popular presidential candidates in history to have a high approval ratings immediately..? 
Do you think they need my SSN too? 
Also the simple fact that the United States is as large as several European countries put together has an effect on the homicide rate as well..... Of course we have much higher rates of everything: we have a larger country.
It's funny because it wasn't TOO bad when you could ping and draw on the map. But thanks to the Russians (when they were a thing 4Head) then we can't even do that. Like really. 
> according to reddit.\n\nLol was prepping my "well that's what everyone on Reddit seems to think" but I just had to finish reading your comment.\n\nFor **FUCKS SAKE** this drives me insane about Reddit after Trump won. They literally are all commenting like as if Obama never did a single thing wrong when his administration was riddled in controversy and major scandals that just never got coverage so the public didn't know about or forgot about. "SAD!"
Hillary didn't get a sentence. What makes you think Trump should? \n\nSeriously this makes me laugh. Democrats pretending they're so high and mighty about Trump having the tiniest, stupidest "scandal" already talking impeachment.... Which party nominated Hillary Clinton again? Which party called that whole thing a political stunt again? Absolutely absurd and hypocritical. Funny. \n\nExcept the fact that get this: Republicans would probably be glad to impeach him. Because they don't like Trump. They love Pence. Most of the party does. That's why the guys saying Trump will be dictator are so delusional. He literally can't because we all don't like him. Rofl. I feel like I'm living the general election all over again. His first week was encouraging... Then the next two were full of "really? This idiot?" moments.  We aren't fans. 
And your name is "Nofascist". You think Trump is a fascist. Why? Because you were told that. Just like you were told it's okay to be an asshole to anyone who thinks differently than you do because Trump supporters are Nazis right? 
Well then you should be a big fan of President Trump!! IF you HATE special interests and big money influencing politics, you ought to LOVE President Trump's plans to hinder lobbying and special interests!!!\n\nIt's hilarious to me how people just eat up the narratives so much so that they don't know the slightest thing about what Trump wants to do Washington. Did you know that Trump was advocating for term limits on Senators and Representatives? Or bans on lobbying? Hillary sure as hell didn't advocate for those things. You should be optimistic with Trump in office if you don't like special interests and the political climate.
Oh so that's what happened. I live in Upstate NY and this was on our news. I missed the part about why the bull was in the streets... 
Not sure if troll or serious. \n\nIf you're serious then you should look into the fact that very few Democrats actually did switch to Republican. This is a pretty dumb myth. \n\nIf troll: lul. 
If you know anything besides the narratives you've been fed you might know that Trump and Pence are completely different have different views and half the administration, the likes of Priebus and Pence and people like that are basically one faction of the administration. It's not at all difficult to imagine that they're alienated about some things from the Trump branch. (Trump, Bannon etc.) 
Thank You, Thank You...
Not sure why but his bolt is locked back to the rear. Not ready to fire? 
When someone sees a few of them repeated and immediately disregards the entire valid point.... \n\nLol.\n\nIs that how far up your behind you have to be to keep up the narrative on refugees because your party says Trump is bad for it? That you literally have to go and disregard objective facts (that there is a LOT of sex crime from refugees in Germany and Sweden. Fact.) because it will make your side look bad? \n\n This isn't why you look at Trump supporters and say that. You say that because you were told to think that way. You don't look at a thing they say, you already have your conclusion. This is the kind of cognitive dissonance that makes ACTUALLY reasonable people look at you and go "lol. Trump is actually right on this. More right than them at least." \n\nTl;dr: this is why Trump won. Way to disregard a fact (rising crimes) because of your political opinion and narrative on refugees. Nice. 
No because the federal government is not and should not be in charge of education. 
Lmao. I want to see this. That's Bill Clinton level stuff 
I'm okay with this. \n\nDo you know anything about Pence? Of course you know he's *SUCH* a homophobe right! 
Living in Upstate New York very close to the PA border (25 minutes) we get a lot of commercials and protests and talk about fracking. I've basically thought the entire time that yeah it's a fantastic idea and way to get energy romantically but we don't know how safe it is. Now we're finding out because it's been several years. \n\nBasically it seems based on what HAS happened so far that it has the potential to be safe but there are some complications. I think if it was regulated properly and able to be done properly with proper well encasing and storage and other techniques it would definitely be safe. \n\nOf course it sure doesn't help when either the last president was so against it and the new one is just for it no matter what. We need a skeptical government policy on it. No sensationalism either direction. 
I initially thought "well duh" when I read the title... Didn't realize until your comment that *they* are Sunni.... Well then. 
LOL. Found the idiot blaming Jews and Israel. Are you a member of Hamas? I'm sure they'd love to have you. \n\nI've got news for you: the Arabs are the ones who don't stop attacking Israel. They've been given the opportunity for peace and reject it every time. Pay some fucking attention. People like you really piss me off. I hate ignoring, stupid, bigots. 
NY Times wants Trump supporters to die early: might as well just report that. ROFL. "Fake news!"
LUL you got downvoted. 
Minority culture as long as it's not Christian culture like the minorities in Syria.... Lul. 
You sure would need an awful lot more to pay in taxes for much higher wait times for simple procedures that ends up bankrupting the whole country. If you want a good example in our own country of the failures of single-payer, government-run healthcare... Look at the VA. Remember that VA scandal? Oh sorry that was an Obama scandal so we don't mention it.... But yeah. That's what single-payer is like. Just go watch the CNN debate between Sanders and Cruz and pay attention to all the stats Cruz rattles off. Single-payer is actually a horrible healthcare "solution". You just end up rationing and those the government deems not as worthwhile have to wait far too long for medical care.

I do not find it all that surprising. The populous in Houston is not as stereo typically "southern texan" as one might think. Wendy Davis gave a rallying speech at my university and I was surprised at the turn out. Houston Chronicle is a rather progressive paper as well although they generally reserve their backing until later in the election. I feel it reflects the views of the majority here in Houston.

Purchased mine 4 years back and it has been my only handgun since. Gen 3's are all I need and it has become my most trusted tool. 
When seconds count my friends, I may be bloody, I may no longer have that finger, or hand or even arm. I dont care, the last thing I need is my gun being rendered inoperable from lint, water or scuffling for possession of my firearm. I have no problem with people purchasing finger print scanning guns, that is their choice. Im afraid in the name of "saftey" All my guns will be forced to have them as well. 
With locking bipods it is less or an issue. But yes the proper way is legs swinging toward the muzzle. 
No comfort in the physical not emotional sense. Carrying a sidearm inside your waistband is rather uncomfortable. 
Yes! Completely unrestrained is not really a good solution to anything in the world of public policy. Currently the policy of shipping firearms for purchase solely to FFL (Federal Firearms Licence) Holders and mandating that they phone in the background check after the person has submitted their ID is a great way to ensure convicted felons don't have easy, immediate, and "legal" access to guns. Sadly beyond the step of initial sale any further programs to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals would be impossible to enforce on a broad enough scale to warrant the violations of civil liberties of law abiding citizens (firearm registrations, magazine limits, bullet buttons, etc.) All of which have loopholes that really can not be closed. \n\nAll the legislation that i have seen beyond a background check has been so intrusive that I do not trust it, especially given that a few of my rifles have been banned in this nation in the past, and attempted to be re-banned in the very recent past.  \n\nFinally, and most disturbing, even under the strictest of limitations on firearms, eg. France, Great Britain, Denmark, etc. we still see violent criminals getting their hands on firearms, the only difference, is the law abiding citizens who chose to abide in authority, and were left defenseless.\n\nGreat question and I am sorry i can not recommend any regulation beyond what is already in place. Criminals have guns, and most were law abiding before their life of crime. Keeping guns out of their hands can not be accomplished without taking it from everyone. Because anyone could become a criminal. \n\n

Many service members in every branch will be armed in the line of duty well before age 21. An example would be military police who could be armed as young as age 18. Infantry and other combat arms branches as well arm their Privates and Private First Class (generally age 18-21) in the line of duty.

Just a heads up. I prefer the bipod backwards. In offhand shooting it moves the weight balance closer to the shooter. But sacrificing good grip on forend  and stability in prone. 
That when using a scoped rifle as long range the shooter holds his cross hairs on the target (dead hold for the gun guys) Rarely past 400m or on a moving target will you ever head dead on the target.   
Guys! This man just lost his arms. Cut it out with these off handed remarks! 
You are almost correct. Service members can carry at age 18 in the state. But yes for 95% of individuals it is 21 and over. 
Thank You, Thank You...
He also utilized a dead goat I believe in Scotland or Iceland to escape some sinking mud by increasing his surface area utilizing the goats body. He laughed and quipped "whatever floats your goat". 
Thanks. Ill probably enlist. 
Most of the guys I deal with in combat arms (infantry, artillery, armor) love em. 
Its not an issue solely limited to campus carry. People in the state of Texas have been carrying for years, openly on the belt for the past 7 months. Legal concealed carries are among the most law abiding citizens in the nation, and nearly any prior convictions felony and sometimes otherwise would preclude that individual from carrying. That stated if someone decides to lash out and harm another the fact that he has a gun in hand, or one in his car or domicile makes little difference. If you are willing to take the life of another human being your access to a firearm is not going to be the limiting factor. finallypermitting campus carry will plant a seed in the mind of anyone who wishes to lash out, what if the person you intend to do harm to is carrying? The man sitting over there enjoying his latte could be as well. This is not to create a sense of paranoia as a law abiding citizen has no need or worry of carrying citizens. But to the person who is debating lashing out, the thought of another armed citizen could very well be an effective deterrent. 
Welp, that explains why she's being a bitch about losing a water bottle...
Planet of the rapes.... \n
I used to watch Lynn Thompson's edged weapon videos about his products (cold steel) they have some excellent knives and ones that serve me to this day! But a lot of their stuff is imported junk. Not bad for being from Taiwan or china but seriously weak edge retention and hardness. \n\nHis videos about edged weaponry are comical at best. Just a bunch of grossly overweight 80's guys who look like a dateline special poster boy. Everytime i see these videos i feel like John Walsh should narrate his clips. 
I am a Christian. I have a gay friends. This is just what i feel in my heart is right. I am not about to be so myopic and arrogant as to assume that my choice of religion or beliefs is absolutely correct and that everyone else deserves to burn in hell. I feel if we we truly judged for our actions i would be just as guilty. Its my duty to love those who do not believe what i do. For the same reason i can have athiest, muslim, trans, mormon, or agnostic friends to name a few. 
Wrong site.. this is Reddit, not Tumblr
Perhaps because it wasn't stealing? She asked for it, was told yes (her manager misunderstood) and even offered to pay. You're being down voted because you're implying that she *was* stealing.
I really enjoyed this class
"What dressings do you have?"\n\n"Italian or ranch"\n\n"Do you have bleu cheese?"\n\n"Nope, sorry.. just italian and ranch"\n\n"Can I get a Caeser"\n\n"...FML..."
Yes, in the same way "The Outer Limits" is still watchable. It's not really scary, but the slightly "horror" themed short stories are still enjoyable.
There's are all great picks. Wyrmwood really surprised me, and though it has some pretty silly things in it, it was very well done. \n\nOh.. and Turbo Kid! I need more movies like this!\n\nSome I'd like to add.\n\n* An American Werewolf in London\n\n* Zombeavers\n\n* Stitches\n\n* Baskin\n\n* Stung\n
I respect that, and I'm sorry if I came across as blaming you. There's very few subs I can really feel at home in, and I want this to be one.. I just can't stand the bickering over what really comes down to semantics. I want to see more releases from the CoS (documents, stories, writings.. I really do love a large part of what they do), more artwork, more personal reflection and yes.. even some posts about the TST. Push the CoS for sure, but you can't deny it gets a little circlejerky at times (is that a word? fuck it.. if tumblr can make up words so can I!).\n\n\nAlso, I'm not sure on Pence. Best analogy I could think of on the spot is Trump is like a schizo, and Pence is bad. I'm not sure who I'd rather have around me. The bad guy that I know is bad and can sort of deal with, or the guy I'm not sure about, who I think I can deal with, but might snap on twitter and cause WW3. If Trump is gonna make it, he's gotta show he can make positive changes, and needs to stop making enemies out of everyone. So far, he seems (in the public view.. which does matter quite a bit) to take criticism personal insults more seriously than he does the country. Stop caring what people say about your inauguration crowd, or your CIA speech FFS, fuck.. come out and say "yep, Obama's crowd drew more, I mean.. first black president.. of course he did, but I'm more concerned with relations with Russia and China, preventing the spread of terrorism and uniting our country. Who cares about crowd sizes?" Well.. he does, which is really the only reason people care... but now I'm ranting, and this is starting to sound like something that belongs in a very different thread. \n\nAnyway, I've taken some positives out of this, I'm glad that we can disagree and still have dialogue.. that's what Reddit subs should be, well.. that and making fun of consoles peasents over at /r/PCMR :D
Naw.. you're right. The proper thing to do is use some [dirt or kitty litter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLt3q0HLyr4), then get a good night's rest. /s\n\n\nIf you're still bleeding, or have a wound that won't close on it's on, then a suture seems much better than nothing. Why are you opposed?
Hmm.. dunno then, I haven't ran into much issues, but TBH, I haven't done much pvp recently, so maybe it's something with an update.\n\nHang in there, these guys (the devs) have made some amazing progress in this game... I'm sure they'll track it down :)
I agree.. Green Inferno did nothing for me. Was an ok flick, but none of the violence or gore made me cringe.. it was more "Oh shit! Lol.. look at that!".\n\nBone Tomahawk? Now that's a whole different beast. Gritty, brutal, and [mostly for the gore] out of nowhere. It really hits you more. Green Inferno was like a less gory "Hostel" for me, while Bone Tomahawk was just disturbing. Really enjoyed/hated that ride :)
236\n\nThe Stanley Parable!\n\nThanks op.\n\nAlso, screw you guys downvoting to prevent visibility!
> "About me: inserts cliché "lol TST cuck" comment.\n\nNice contribution. Don't you have a coloring book to insult, or a statue to make fun of?\n\n\n 
I'm in the US too, and that "30 minutes after 5" rule is pretty rare in the service industry. The majority of my work the last 13 years has been waiting tables. Virginia, Florida, Illinois and California. The only job I've had that does that is my current one. I worked for the same company in Chicago and there was no rule. You'd often work [at $4ish/hr] for 8-9 hours with no breaks, other than having someone watch your tables so you could kill a smoke in 45 seconds. Lunch is that thing you eat an hour whenever you get a second in the back.\n\nThat said, your job shouldn't feed you, never said that... but a job limiting non-alcoholic drinks to service employees is pretty shitty. It's one of the highest marked up items, and nearly always comes with free unlimited refills for a reason. It's cheap as shit, and costs next to nothing to waste.. hence the unlimited refills. How much of the $2.99 do you think the company actually pays in cost?
Very cool watch.. thanks :)
You seem to be trying very hard, so lets just leave it at this. If you're gonna leave mocking quips, expect them in kind. Don't get all butt-hurt and turn to cliche ad hominem. \nMan up already, geeze. The fact you can't even take a slight poke without losing your shit is pretty sad.  @@\n\n\n
Outer Limits was my favorite, the slightly newish one (1995 one). The stories were just so out there at times.. absolutely loved it.\n\n
What was the point of that?
Well that certainly changes it. Never have heard that term before, but my much older (65) roomie had. \n\nWorked at this awesome bar in Chicago that allowed the few of us that worked there to drink on the job, as long as we paid half price. I do miss bar tending in a local dive :)
Not OP, but this is great to hear. I've really been considering getting a test kit, and $20 off sounds pretty good to me :)
Hmm.. so .\n\n* Do you have frostbite? Yes, see step two\n\n* Dry off, find somewhere warm, warm up\n\nReally?\n\n
> My main point is that the ad does nothing to bring Americans together.\n\nYou mean does nothing to bring trump supporters together? Considering it's reception on youtube, reddit, facebook, and in the media, so far it seems to have a much higher percentage of likes/positive to dislikes/negative.\n\nYou cannot picture how the ad was viewed through someone else's eyes, as you already have your own fixed opinion on it. You can explain how it plays to people who share your bias, but certainly not mine, or many others. \n\nHonestly, the whole basis of your opinion is that other's must view it as you did. As for the second half, you are reaching quite a bit.\n\nI'm not sure what Obama and Islam have to do with this. Sure, many Muslims have views different from yours. Many Christians have views vastly different from mine. Has zero to do with this commercial or this conversation. I'll just assume it's getting late and you're digressing. 
I really loved the ending.. during the first half, I would have never guessed it would move that direction. Really liked that one.
lol same... only mines usually because a new game came out, or I took a break, and can't bring myself to restart and play through the first 14 hours that I've played over and over. 
Can't find it now, but just read a story yesterday about this very situation. An Iraqi interpreter who worked with the Army is now banned. I believe he was close to moving his family over, after working with the US against ISIS for quite some time. His family has been threatened multiple times and his brother was murdered because of his work with the US. \n\nThese are people who risked their lives and those of their families to help, they've earned their place in this country, many times more than some of the keyboard cowboys here have.

A satanist doesn't stop being a satanist just because you do something to help. You make it sound as if you stop becoming a satanist so that you can do something that might end up benefiting you, then you become one again when you log online.. not making much sense. You don't need to attach a word to it. The point of the OP wasn't "hey, this is a satanists call!" but rather "we are satanists, how do we feel about this?" You don't stop being who you are.\n\n> It may seem that this sub is that way because that's what Satanism is\n\nuh huh.. and I suppose /r/European went all neo-nazi because that's what the continent of Europe is right? Just because one sub-set is currently more vocal, doesn't mean that is the only definition of Satanism. If this sub suddenly had an influx of theistic satanists, would satanism suddenly change? Can't use the loudest of a group as a metric for the definition of said group.
That's the best part.. I'm not a member of the TST, or the CoS. I just call out "bandwagon" remarks and poke fun in return.\n\n> this is really not the place for TST\n\nI'm gonna disagree there... The CoS was my first introduction into Satanism, and I've learned a lot from them, though I also don't agree with everything from them, which is perfectly fine too. On the same vein, I do agree with some of what the TST does (not satanically per se, but in some of what the "real" organization does) and disagree with a ton of it. So long as this is a Satanism sub, and not a CoS sub, then I feel all forms should be allowed here to discuss. I mean, look at the sidebar. If the TST isn't welcome here, why are they even mentioned? The Seven Tenets, the TST website and their FAQ are listed. I would say (at least for now) they are welcome here, if only by the mods and 10% of the subs.   \n\n"/r/Satanism values the free exchange of thoughts and ideas as well as an open dialogue." is right under the rules, however there's a vocal group that seems to think that isn't the case. The moment someone exchanges a thought or idea that doesn't fit the narrative, it's "lol cuck fuck off with your black lipstick and basement!" to which I can only laugh when I see the black robes, alters, candles and skulls. Now, that's just me sitting back watching the whole thing. That's not me mocking one or the other, just simply pointing out the obvious. \n\n> The hostility is unfortunate\n\nI completely agree. There's no reason for it. It's like /r/gaming and PC vs Console. Sure, you can argue one or the other (I'm PC, so that's a stretch to admit) but you can't argue they're both gaming. If this sub went "CoS members/ideology only" I really wouldn't care. I'd still sub, still get what I want out of it, and still chime in once or twice over the months and months of silently browsing. In that situation, though, it would at least make sense. As for now, this sub (at least according to the sidebar and few interactions with mods that I've had) is for all Satanists.. even if that doesn't conform to any particular person's view.\n\n\n*edit*\n\na letter
> Reading comprehension... live it, love it... learn it.\n\nBut not practicing it apparently. /smh
What does "barely speaking Spanish" have to do with it? Prestigious schools? Pretty sure most American born people don't go to prestigious schools.\n\n\nKinda seems like you already have a bit of bias. If I'm wrong, I'm sorry.. it just seems that way when you point out language and education as a merit for judging an immigrant, when a large portion of the American population can barely grasp high school level English, and has a much lower education.\n\n\nAs for how you saw it's message, well.. that's you. And like you said, other's may have saw the same. I can't argue that, because interpretation is in the eye of the beholder, so no argument there. I just don't think the commercial was to be taken literally. No one is going to be able to build a giant swing door into a massive wall by themselves without attracting a lot of attention. If it's not a literal message, then it's a symbolic message, which leads me to my original point. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nSeems more likely [to me] that it is a simple statement, that they [this company] don't support Trump or his xenophobic ideals. Those thinking this is literal, are ignoring the rest of the commercial.
 Hear what Captain Planet has to say
It's not really weird to carry them in the area, it is pretty rural here. Just in the restaurant I work at, plenty of the younger servers never grew up with knives, and so don't know the usefulness of having one.\n\nI already got some strange looks when I forgot to take off my fixed blade after getting caught in the rain when I rode my bike to work. Just park, covered up the air filter and ran inside. Now I stick to the multitool at work, just to avoid having to answer the same dumb questions again and again. "Why do you have a knife?" "Why do you need a knife?" etc.
Other than a bit of ad hominem, seems you sort of agree with me, though don't want to admit it.\n\nYes, I was alive then.. so.. guess that point doesn't land.\n\nActive duty.. ok. Are you saying you don't know any other Satanists in the service, or that you're the only one with completely selfish reasons for being there?\n\n> A person doesn't have to be a member of the Church of Satan to be a Satanist, but they do have to feel that The Satanic Bible reflects who they are as a person.\n\nI completely agree, and that was *my* point. You can be a Satanist and not agree with everything the Satanic Bible says, or you can have an interpretation that differs from that of the CoS's. The whole point was that this endless CoS vs Everyone circlejerk gets old after awhile.\n\n\n Didn't anyone ever read "*The Sneeches and Other Stories*" as a kid?
> Does the ai still walk through walls, flip out when you enter buildings, or give up when you go upstairs in a house?\n\nNope, there's been some pretty good improvements\n\n> It's a game where you walk around collecting canned cat food, and hiding from other players who want to rape you.\n\nWell.. yeah, no ones arguing that ;p
SWOOSH...\n\nJust went right over your head didn't it? You may want to go back and google that again, then sleep on it, maybe come back tomorrow. If you still can't figure it out, I'll walk you through it step by step. \n\n
Yeah, I've got both this and TiA in, and honestly.. the two are so similar (in the utter stupidity I see from the examples in the posts) that I confuse them. Actually, I think I found this place first, then got all my random bans (offmychest, etc) then laughingly found TiA as well.\n\nThe gamergate stuff is great too; stories of dumb censorship, the whole power fantasy vs objectification nonsense, etc. Just devil's advocate on the politics. The rest are just retarded, and I can't imagine why people would visit just to report. I can see that in really big subs (news, worldnews, politics, T_D) that might spill over into others, but damn.. come to a place and cry about what they're doing? Why not just fucking leave?\n\n\nKinda curious.. what new changes are coming?
"Ain't no thing but a hyper-chicken wing"
Having seen the first two, I'd say hell yes! Fun cheesy movies that are overall, pretty entertaining. 
It's completely legalized now, but sadly many places still will. 
I've noticed the same thing. I picked up a Gerber folder, one of those half serrated, half tanto blades. Don't get me wrong, it was still a decent knife, but the finish chipped/scratched very easily, the hinge screw was always either too lose or too tight, and the belt clip was crap. \n\nI remember Gerber being a good brand :(
Wine, always wine.\n\n
Also the end of their career

Have any experience with adding items to your bracelet? I've recently developed an interest in a paracord bracelet, and had that "I can do better" mentality. I've only browsed a few videos, so haven't really made a decision yet, but I've seen several for sale with "kits" braided inside. Most seem very gimmicky, but I do think being able to stash a couple of fish hooks and a firestarter in one would be nice, so long as it wasn't bulky enough that I wouldn't want to wear it.\n\nAny advice or perhaps a particular video you'd recommend?
What are playing on? I haven't experienced any of these "crippling frame rates" even in pvp. \n\nSure, there's some performance issues that should be fixed by release, but nothing as bad as you describe. \n\nMaybe post your system specs, and we can help?
My pit bulls would [disagree](http://i.imgur.com/wzWUFYp.jpg). I think cats belong inside, but only because I wouldn't risk having my pet killed. The 3 or 4 cats dumb enough to jump into my yard last year aren't gonna make a huge dent in the numbers though ;p
> anarcho-communist? What the fuck is that?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communism
Someone else said that, and I thought.. damn.. that's a bit paranoid.\n\nQuick search, and there's several phone apps for just this! I suppose you'd have to be targeted for someone to do that, but doesn't seem so tin-foil now. You won't get robbed from it (windows being easy to break and all) but someone near by targeting you, finding a picture, and making a copy that way? Damn.. what a world.
Yeah.. first off, tourists visit a helluva lot more of the city than Navy Pier.. you have been to Chciago right? \n\nThere's also a ton of reasons for tourists to visit the south and west side of Chicago, so I'm not sure where you got that. I'm guessing since you said you got your facts by proxy, that you really don't know what you're talking about and have never actually been to those areas.\n\nYou heard, through your cousin, that he heard a cop say, that it might have been a gang? Really? @@\n\nI'm sure that one indecent put a little fear into you, but believe me, shit happens everywhere, and given the amount of people in Chciago, that incident is much rarer than other smaller places. Yeah, there's a violence problem in Chicago but it is very contained within certain neighborhoods. Nothing like your "Gangland" hype.\n\n\nI'm sure your "Chicago cops" know best.. those guys are the most upstanding police in the nation... right? RIGHT??!? @@\n\n 
Safe space? Was that a freudian slip? I must've struck a nerve with that one. LOL!
2017.. time to repost this again!
Oroville Dam **Spillway Failure**\n\n\nTitle is accurate.
The topic definitely devolved through the comments, so I'll give you that. OP asked for opinions and got some, however I was more responding to the overall theme in general held through all the comments, which I never clarified. \n\nWhy I'm more addressing, is one group going against others for differences in opinion over the same source material. The biggest example would be christianity vs islam, whereas an outsider can easily point to fact and history to show the common origins, while either side would vehemently claim the other was the impostor. I don't care if people are CoS members, TST members or something in between (where I find myself).. don't care if it's theistic, atheistic or agnostic. I'm not trying to be mean, or attack or insult anyone.. I'm just tired of this mentality of "us vs everyone" that keeps cropping up. Maybe this will change, but last I checked, this sub catered to Satanism, not one particular brand of it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for the last part, that's pretty optimistic. 8% of US presidents have been assassinated in office, with verified attempts on 37%. Considering his actions, his plummeting approval rating and the number of enemies he keeps making, both domestic and foreign, I'd put my money against him making it that far, but now we're simply guessing. If there's one this Trump and this election proved, it's that no one knows what the fuck is going to happen. 
Not a fan, I don't want to lose the percentages.
[The Similars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5KzfzyDxrQ)\n\nWow, just wow. Now there's a lot of good reccomendations in this thread, but haven't seen this pop up.

I went in blind after reading a rather silly review, and was very impressed.\n\nWell worth a watch!\n\n\nOthers,\n\n* Stung\n\n* Let Us Prey\n\n* Infini (sci-fi horrorish)\n\n* Wymwood\n\n* Turbo Kid\n\n* Zombeavers\n
Yeah, but office work isn't demanding at all. You clearly have time to sit around and post on reddit. Not so much with many service industry workers, who are constantly moving, and often go entire shifts without a break or lunch. Can't really compare the two.
that's more money than I made tonight waiting tables >_< \n\nDamn California floods!
Same in every game, until you're the tank, then the squishiest guy around won't stay behind you. 
I mean.. I get the politics reports. I love this place, but lately everything making it to my front page is pretty much the same shit being covered by T_D and Politics, albeit with a radical slant [in either T_D or Politics] in one direction or the other depending on which sub. I mean it's either "boo.. no free speech, look how violent they are" or "LoL, this guy that was quoted saying he won't apologize for being mean is asking for an apology for people saying something mean to him!"\n\n\nI like this place for humor, eyerolls, and a glimpse into the nonsense that goes on with the Tumblr crowd, not for reading the same political crap being posted in political subs. Just my thoughts. /shrug\n\n\n**edit**\n\nclarification
Didn't mean to imply that, never read you as saying you'd quit.. just my "well.. I'm out of ideas.. try waiting?" approach. I love this game too, one of the best survival/crafting open world games I've found. Sorry if I came across that way.\n\n
Thanks for that, I just got a new knife and wanted something like this.. you just saved me days of google :D
Federation! It was a MUD way back when. You could buy a planet and describe it anyway you wanted. I was a kid then, but my mom was diabolical. Her planet was very nice, relaxing, and full of stuff people needed (so they'd visit) but was also full of deathtraps, unkillable spaceships and all sorts of evil things. Was awesome!
I don't think so.. but with the quotations maybe, as it sort of implies it's a title, and not referring to the take on Nazi. It wouldn't be capitalized without the quotations though. People discussing the orthography on english.stackexchange seem about 50/50 depending on it's implied use.
Not even that, just the fries worth about $1.

Hey conspiracy nut! Yeah you. The annoying type that wants to look "woke" like the tweens on Tumblr. Why would you be so paranoid and afraid that someone has access to the DNA you are practically shooting and spreading over everything you come into contact with? Your complete identity left smeared over every surface you've come into contact with, just out there in the world?\n\nGet your head out of your [dunno, can't even come up with something to make fun of that dumb statement] and welcome to the real world. Get Woke!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk, serious time. Why are you so terrified that someone has access to the same thing as every single surface you've ever touched? They gonna make clones of you? Maybe send your clones to the moon to mine H3 with the promise of returning after two years, only to recycle you and pop out a new one? \n\n\nHonestly, why are you worried about your DNA? Do you avoid getting haircuts, because the people at the salon have access to your DNA? Do you not eat out, just in case the server decides to send your spoon off to a lab? What are you so worried about?
I do at work all the time, draws less attention than my regular knife. I wait tables, so there's a lot of "variety" in the type of people there, and a smaller blade on a multi-tool is less "threatening" than opening up my dedicated knife.
If they charge her, are they going to charge every person at the school with manslaughter too? The principle, perhaps the superintendent. Should blame the parents too and charge them from not taking enough action. \n\nI know this will get downvoted, but I feel like charging someone with manslaughter for being a dick (which isn't a crime, though it does make you a dick) is just outright retarded. \n\nIf your manager is being mean/rude/insulting/unfair/etc, then report it to someone higher, transfer to another store or simply find a new job. This person was wrong, and a terrible person, but didn't commit a crime. \n\n\nSecondly, is this quote that keeps coming up in the comments.\n\n> Glasgow School District Superintendent Mike Reynolds admitted bullying took place in his district, but he claimed it wasn’t too bad.\n\nWhy does everyone seem so shocked? Did you not go to school? I went to two different high schools; one in Florida, and one in California. Guess what, there was bullying. There was bullying in grade school too, and at the rec center, at the YMCA and even at the summer camp. Now, as a teen.. sure, I thought it was awful. Several fights, vandalism, name calling and even being chased home several times. Yes, bullying is bad, but it's not as if every single time a micro-aggression is commit, there's students lining up to add the report to the "Big Book of Bullying" the Superintendent keeps on display. Some people are acting like there's roaming gangs of bullies striking terror and fear into the hearts of the student body, and the Superintendent is purposefully hiding the fact as he's on the bullies' payroll.
So much this!!!!\n
It's legalized in **[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Use_of_Marijuana_Act)**, this is a California sub.. are people really not getting that?
Incredible? Looked like he was struggling to keep up with a bike that should've been at a disadvantage... with two people. 
just replying to say whoever downvoted this is a douche,\n\nAnyway, friend of mine has one of these, I tried playing with it. I dunno, seems kinda big for me, though I guess I'm not much of a "fidget" person. He raves about it though, and it did seem very well made. I think if there was a micro version, like half the size or smaller, I might enjoy it. /shrug\n\n\nAlso, how are those headphones? Any latency issues? I've been thinking about getting a wireless pair, but the fact that a lot of my headphone time is spent in Rocksmith (already a shit-ton of latency there) I've kinda avoided them. In reality though, I'm constantly snagging, running over, or pinching, the cord on my Turtle Beach set, so wireless would be nice. 
Yeah. It was fun to read, but there were a few headshakers. 
Good.
One drink per shift?!? Are the only drinks you serve high end specialty drinks? Where is this? I've worked a lot restaurants (and fast food when I was a teenager) and it's always been a "if it's refillable, it's free" sort of deal.\n\nI work at Olive Garden now... soft drinks, tea, coffee, lemonades, juice.. all free. We get left over soups, [some] mistakes (Darden has a "Harvest" program that freezes and donates the majority of "mistake" food to shelters), pretty much as much bread as we want, extra salads at the end of the night, free appetizers and deserts for guests raving about us, etc. I couldn't imagine working somewhere where they wouldn't allow more than a single drink during a shift. I'm sorry. 
Yep.. you sure can!\n\nFirst, you might wanna head over to the [Steam Workshop ](https://steamcommunity.com/app/383120/workshop/) and sub to a few things, there's some amazing ships, bases and other misc things. There's some pretty nice starter blueprints included, but you might find something more suited to your taste there. Once you sub to the item, it's in your blueprints :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk, now you have two options in game.\n\n    finishbp\n    spawnanyblueprint\n\n*finishbp* will finish whatever blueprint you have loaded. So with this command you load the blueprint you want into the factory, then open the console [~ key] and use finishbp\n\n*spawnanyblueprint* is a toggle that switches from the factory to the creative mode (for blueprints). With this command any of your blueprints can simply be spawned.\n\n\nTo see more commands, just type help in the console. Most are self explanatory. Also, *itemmenu* will toggle the creative item menu, which you can access with the H key. Great if you just need to grab a bit more fuel/o2/etc :) 
I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. 
Oh yeah, they're great. you can also add em in using the steam overlay while in game (visiting the workshop) and they'll be available right away to use :)
How do you like the Keysmart? How is fitting a [oversized] car key?\n\nI've been wanting to get one, and only have 3 normal keys, and one car key (large plastic body) and was wondering how they'd fit.
Not sure if you'd consider animation, but [Dead Space: Downfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M40k7JgHEFQ) and [Dead Space: Aftermath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD4CFJ8ncZc) were both very good imho.
What are the little pieces of (guessing here) drinking straw over the keys for?
It's ok.. wouldn't really expect a RN to have much experience with military training. I'm sure it goes without saying (and no offense) but I'd rather take the advice of my instructors. \n\nThe original comment was more a joke/meme rolled into one anyway (hence the family guy clp). No.. you don't typically suture to stop bleeding, though it can be used in extreme cases. Same goes with large non-closing wounds that would either tear more or cause other risks being open, where a simple bandage won't hold, though less rare. In cases like these, emergency sutures can be effective until proper medical attention can be received.\n\nThere's a lot of things you shouldn't do, if you don't know what you're doing. That doesn't mean there aren't other people who do know what they are doing.
Not really, both are to the Constitution. The enlisted oath just has the additional bit about obeying orders\n\n> I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God." (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>  I, _____, having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God." (DA Form 71, 1 August 1959, for officers.)\n\n
Stop thinking and buy!\n\nI've actually never seen someone cheat, and I've been on a lot of servers. PVP isn't really my thing, so I mostly do PvPvE type. (mostly friendly, but combat in space and other planets. The offline protection is something missing from a lot of games, but not here. \n\nOverall, I'd say it's worth it even if I don't play as much as I should.
Meh, this is full of half truths and a ton of lies (in regards to Chicago). I'm not sure if you got your info from "Gangland" or just youtube. Having lived in several areas, from North Chicago (the city, 1300 Broadway, straight up GD territory.. I literally lived across from the main NCGD house there), to Edgewater, to the outskirts of Portage Park, as well as having plenty of friends on the south and west side.\n\nNo, you will not get jumped (99.99% chance) walking home drunk on the north side. I worked for years in Lincolnwood as a server and would walk home to edgewater late at night, many times stopping to drink along the way, without more than a few scrubs asking for smokes. Some punks tried to jump me once, but it was on the bike path connecting Howard and Devon at 11am, and had nothing to do with gang violence.\n\n\nLol.. south and west are no go. Are you serious? Sure, I would probably avoid walking if I could, but I certainly never felt like I would die being there. Hell, one of the two main "public trans" routes to the Science Museum leaves you waiting in the south side. Never had a problem once. That's not even mentioning the clubs down there.\n\n\nI get you wan't to make a point, but don't go spreading nonsense based on what you saw on Gangland >_<
Did you watch the commercial, like the whole thing? Remember the guy in the truck, driving away with a smile, bed loaded with lumber and tools?\n\nPretty sure the message wasn't a literal "hey, illegals this way" but rather that real Americans will make a stand, and that the company stands by real Americans, not xenophobic cowards.
> In response to Newton and other mass shootings, the duly elected members of the General Assembly of Maryland saw fit to enact the States Firearm Safety Act of 2012  (the "FSA"), which names the AR-15 and other  military-style rifles and shotguns (referred to as "assault weapons")\n\nMaybe go back and read the full document.
/facepalm, I read damn near everything except the last sentence >_<\n\n\nalso.. finish the games and watch :)
Should check out [Subnautica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsZkt6E7nmo) :) \n
or just have the spots they punch spawn minerals and rubble, sort of like the Sea Treaders do.
> he plane that hit the Pentagon on 9/11 flew over my car in Alexandria that day. I joined the military to fight back against people trying to control my life with their religion\n\nEverything else aside, and us arguing here and in a few past posts, I have a ton of respect for that. I was actually already signed up with the Navy and had one last MEPS visit before shipping out for Great Lakes Naval Station.. on 9/12/2001. It was at MEPS the next day I spoke with an Army recruiter, and swapped branches and MOS. My reason for swapping to Infantry were different, but anyone enlisting after that, knowing what might have came.. you get my respect.\n\n\n**edit**\n\na letter
If there's one thing I can say about Corsair, it's that they have THE best warranty / customer service ever. I've dealt with them twice, and am constantly upgrading to Corsair where I can now.\n\nI didn't even know about those rugged usb keys, but damn.. now I need one!\n

If you're going to go "grammar Nazi" on someone, you might want to actually use proper grammar, capitalization and punctuation when you do it. Just saying...\n\n/smh
> How is throwing a coffee breaking the law?\n\nUm, because it's illegal to throw objects at a vehicle, and in Chicago it's another charge for throwing something into the roadway.\n\n> If we expect a cop to be above childish, shouldn´t we expect it from everyone?\n\nThat doesn't justify the opposite.. I don't get what point, if any, you're making.
You're right.. what do I know. Those guys in charge of my training must not have known what they were talking about. My bad.. I guess the US Army wasn't a good place to learn first aid. I'm sure a random person on reddit knows much more than my instructors. \n\n/smh\n\n\n
Man.. I'm a bit buzzed.. I completely forgot about /r/All. I've only ever even looked at that maybe 3 times in several years. That makes sense. Even if this didn't get there, whatever made all would probably bring them here.\n\nthanks for the link.. I'll be sure to check that out.
What does "assault rife" mean to you. Would you define it? \n\nIs your definition based on capability, or appearance? 
... Gross. I'm mad that I'm laughing...
ha ha. When done right, yes. \n\nI have a buddy that got a place to do it on one of his guns... Let's just say they got a little trigger happy with it. I don't have the heart to tell him I could have done better with Krylon. 
I'm gonna say Croc Hole is much better, due to usefulness and the novelty of the term. 
Mmm. If you're playing the newest version that's gonna crash your game. Glass weapons break, and if a weapon breaks in your trap the code doesn't know what to do so the game crashes to a halt and you're suddenly back on your desktop screen. 
That is an enlightened response. 
> Cold blood won't keep you warm at night!\n\nFantastic hypothetical slogan, Urist. 
He did. I don't recall if he finished it yet. I pretty much went to bed right after that, and I didn't get to play yesterday. 
There are some pretty decent places to fish freshwater within an hour or two. Smallmouth, largemouth, panfish, and catfish are pretty much what you'll be after. If you go a little further west you can get into the mountains and try for trout. \n\nThere's plenty of hiking, and a surprising amount of hunting within a relatively short drive, so long as you're not trying to use a centerfire rifle. \n\nI second the Park Lane tavern plug. Love that place. Also try Saisaki Asian Bistro and Sushi Bar over around Kiln Creek. Great place if you're into sushi and Asian food. 
Geez, man. Watching that katana bend is almost physically painful. That's a lot of work, just to ruin it. I guess the longsword that he breaks was a lot of work too, just the fact that it shatters is somehow less jarring than that pretzel bend. 
Actually, no. You have to set them as being used for that specific purpose using a 'q' menu, I think. 
Buddhaception?
I never respect the 1 v 1 if I have a choice. Who cares about honor? ... *reads title* ... Uh... Balls. Ok. 
Our cat was getting ready to be an impromptu sock due to his constant peeing all over the wash room. Odd, considering he's generally a great cat. I finally witnessed firsthand what was wrong. \n\nSee, we'd gotten a big tote box (like a 40 gallon tote) and cut a hole in the lid for him to enter. This way, the litter didn't get kicked out and our toddler couldn't get into it. The problem was that I cut the hole when Gambit wasn't fully grown, and now he couldn't get all the way through. This left him with his head, shoulders, and much of his body in the litterbox where he wanted to be, but his hips were hanging out and spraying rancid cat-water all over the place. \n\nI cut him a bigger hole before I even washed the lid off. Problem solved. 
Yeah! Delicious industrial sized health potions! \n
It's bloody effective. \n\nWell, it was in old MW. 
That's good advice, but I'd learn to farm before I tackled water. From a farm you can get your products for booze, which your dwarves need more than water. 
They can smell desperation like a shark smells blood or a bear smells fear. Sometimes, though, they mis-read the signal and try to bite the wrong thing, like a surfboard or a car full or NRA members. 
Depends on where the deer lives. In a heavily hunted area a large buck will probably be hunted multiple times until he eventually goes down. \n\nMore remote or less-hunted areas will obviously decrease the likelihood of any animal being hunted, let alone shot. 
Love the alligators coming up through your water system. Had a similar problem once, but with a weremammoth. 
Depends on if you just reached the turn-around point in your morning run. On the one hand, its super panicky and stressful. On the other hand, motivation!
Ha!
It's like carrying a gun, or an epi pen. You probably won't need it, but if you do you REALLY NEED IT. Heck, I can't imagine a tourniquet is that difficult to pack around, anyway. 
They're a lot of fun, and that's about it. Practicality has very little to do with it. 
THEY PROBABLY DID! THE JACKSONIAN POLITICAL ERA IS SO HILARIOUS TO READ ABOUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE SPITE AND PISSINESS.
It might not do as well for breaking armor, since steel/iron is harder than the silver, but the force shouldn't change. 
So they know that they're little interfering, thieving douche-birds? I'm supposed to like this?\n\nNope. Send out the crossbow squads, amirite /r/dwarffortress? 
This is what I did. 
Why do they need to do that when ganging up is so effective? The objective is to win the fight. Can you do it by tossing them off a cliff? Go ahead. Use your run speed to clear a losing fight until you get help? Go ahead. Play smart. 
It's in the bucket of the trackhoe down at the bottom of the hole. Can't see it from here. Use trackhoe for scale

America! 
I wasn't sure either, but I played the open beta and that sold me completely. It's a really interesting experience. 
I was talking to my wife Sunday, and she said that my dad and I are a lot alike. This was a great compliment to me, because my dad's great. It put me in mind of how different our hands are. My dad's got these hard, rough, hands and a face full of scars from the things he did on my paw-paw's farm. I'll never, ever have hands like that, because by the time he was my age my dad had already done three lifetimes worth of manual labor. I work hard, and my collar's been blue plenty of times, but it give me this weird mixture of relief and regret that I'll never get past that particular benchmark. 
Yep. \n\nIt's a riot. There's only one game I've played that I completely hated, and that wasn't the game's fault, I was just getting outplayed to an outrageous degree. \n\nThe fighting has a lot of depth, and the characters feel a lot more unique and special than your average shooter character does, mostly because the weapons are very much functionally different. \n\nIt's a good game, and I'd recommend it.  
So did the Lieutenant in my office. He laughed when he came to look more closely. I'll probably end up telling him about the game later. Pretty laid-back office. 
Too many commas, amigo. 
One thing I have to say to you is this: Until you understand a little better what you're doing, don't pick the "prepare carefully" option when you start to embark. Pick the start now option. They'll give you everything you need for a basic embark, just perhaps not optimized to the degree a lot of people like. That way you can learn what steps you need to take to strike the earth successfully, without accidentally forgetting to bring picks, or axes, or food, or whatever. 
Oh man, I was sooooo hoping that's where that link would go, and I was not disappointed. My maw maw had a tape of Ray Steven's greatest video hits. That bad boy was on there. 
I'm kinda sad I sold my Rossi .17 HMR break over when I was younger. Same sorta thing. It was also one of their line of combo rifles, so you could just slap a new barrel/chamber on there and be good to go with a new gun.
I know I've done that in dwarf fortress at least twice. Once with water, once with magma. \n\nAlso: Hello Urist! I don't see a lot of us out here in the wilds beyond /r/dwarffortress. 
Seeing that trackhoe down there really basalted my sense of scale. Wow that's a deep hole!
Doesn't that make it pretty much just milk again?\n\nMaybe not whole milk, but like 30% milk?
I have the version from the Lazy Windoze Pack, but there are a few differences. \n\nHow would I go about updating to this version?
Basically. 
That's the thing about good tactics and solid play: You don't leave room for counters or even realization. \n\nSometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you. 
Sucessfully bitten and it draws blood. If the bite latches over clothing or armor, without breaking the skin, it is not an infectious bite. Additionally, shaking attacks do not seem to spread infection, despite being done by the biting parts. 
I'm going to go ahead and guess that this was posted from mobile and that's why the lake's name is wrong and the word "urban" ended up in there for some reason. Autocorrect got OP. 
Did you check to see if he'd had a relative die recently?
Have you read the Stormlight Archive? 
And pig's intelligence varies by pig. Some pigs are smarter than some 2-year old children. Some pigs, if you ask me, as smarter than some adult humans, but that's me having had a really smart pig for a pet, and generally having little faith in the intelligence of other humans. 
If you find yourself in a fair fight, it means your tactics suck. Does it annoy me to have that happen? Yup. Is it my fault I fell for it and got rekt? Yup. Sometimes you just gotta let em go. 
No that's something else and I still can't figure out what the hell she's talking about. 
I FOUND YOU!! NOW I CAN MAKE MY RED ROOK!!!!!!!
A good way to put it. 
Etch first, then cerakote. Cerakote goes on as a spray, so it'll get in the etches just fine.

We're 'Muricans first. As long as we meet on that ground, we can get along and make progress. Loyal dissent is the hallmark of our relationship with our government. Without the parties that oppose us, we lose the counterweight that keeps us balanced and run off into all kinds of madness.

This is a falsehood. Due to wounds sustained in the French and Indian Wars, George Washington was on his death bed, when an eagle flew in through an open window and fused itself to his torso, saving his life and giving him superior vision, along with the ability to produce the eagle's scream as a bone-chilling war cry. Historical artists were not ever able to adequately capture the fusion. 
Because their single-minded obsession with material wealth often overrides their sense of self-preservation. 
Happens in cages a lot because you tame them in cages, but they' won't get dealt with again as long as they're in cages. Get them back to "tame" and then let them out. For the most safety, make sure they aren't assigned to any particular trainer so that if that guy winds up busy, dead, or both they won't go feral. 
It just takes for friggin ever. 
Not promotion eligible, therefore no reason to give a higher statement that could better benefit someone else?
"good" does not necessarily mean "complex" or "difficult." In fact, in the realm of tactics, things that are effective are good, and generally get better the simpler and easier they are to do, while still being effective. \n\nAs for "being planned" I guess I can agree with that. I doubt they discussed it beforehand, but some tactics are spur of the moment, and this is smooth enough that I'm pretty sure it was intentional. \n\nAnd no, it's not R6. It's a lot more interesting. 
Wow, what a story! Definitely not the usual way things go. \n\nJust FYI: "should have" not "should of" 
I used the bones of cave toads, forgotten beasts, naked mole dogs, giant gray langurs (those were killed outside in a separate border war), cave crocs, and giant olms. All the stuff (aside from trolls and troglodytes) that died to the FBs during their occupation of the caves. 
Probably need gypsum powder for a cast, then. Trade for it. 
Build a floor on the level above the magma. Wall it off and then floor the level above the walls. Remove floor tiles to allow your shops access to magma. 
I think the bigger issue here is "stop trying to play online games on your friggin 4 gig up/.75 down connection. Maybe replace your 8 year old modem or something. Games require a good connection. If you do not have one,get one. If you cannot afford one, perhaps you should re-think sinking 65 bucks into a video game when you probably need other things more. \n\nI haven't ever been booted because of me. I have hosts d/c a couple of times per long play session, but it's hurt my performance a whole lot less than an over-fondness for heavy attacks. 
I love it. 
It doesn't always work that way. If the attackers are willing to back off for a few seconds, or just really good at defending, they can wait out the revenge and resume massacring the poor dude they're after. \n\nSource: I'm the dude they're after... T.T
And a crossbow. And firebombs. And artillery strikes. 
Remember also that you can't 'd'ig into a flat layer. You have to c'h'annel down a layer, then 'd'ig into the wall. 
Given the astronaut ratio, I think that's a lot of people's rule, with variations in extremity. 
The thing is that in the case of heavy clothing interfering with an HP round, the thing is just gonna clog up and work like an FMJ anyhow. It's not gonna just friggin stop. 
Play the campaign. Lots of training there for you, and the bosses are no joke. Friggin Gunmundr and his damned dogs. 
I had to stop playing MOBAs in general. I enjoy them for depth of play, but I hate them because I'm a rager. I hate it when there's an idiot on my team who's not getting beaten because his opponent is very skilled, but because he himself is a retard. I hate it even more when that guy is me. And one or the other of those things happens in 2/3 games. It just quit being worth it. I miss em, sometimes, but I won't go back. 
I mean, it's possible. If you're willing to dox your grandpa. \n\nToo bad though, I'd like to see that. 
Your best bet is to make a marksdwarf cage, so they can't get to the enemy, then lock em in at the start of a siege. 
And floors over the top. Yeah. \n\nI tend to make a 1-wide walkway with fortifications on either side as a sort of ring wall around my entry area. In this fort I've modified the process. It's a double wall, with one space between, floored over with grates. They double as a walk space and shooting access for my dwarves, while the artificial tunnel is my trapway for enemies to negotiate. I like to think it's a good plan. We'll see how it pans out in practice. 
If I'd have thought about it a little more, I would have. I just thought we could handle the beast. \n\nThe number of crying mamas in the Mountainhome tells me I'm wrong. 
"Bugukkie" pornos, lol.
M855 has a steel penetrator at the tip, just fyi.

How in many movies you have tons of characters in US crime dramas using full auto guns. I could understand some of the older 80's weapons like the MAC-10, but plenty of heist movies that take place in the US have crooks using modern assault rifles constantly. "The Town" is a great example of this because you have bank robbers running HK 416's, same kind of rifle DEVGRU used in the Bin Laden raid. How the fuck did they get their hands on that kind of hardware when that shit is so regulated only special dealers can import it but can't even sell it? If the ATF ever recovered one at a crime scene, the person who imported it would be royally fucked.
But what's bugging me is that my Lee wasn't an issue until today, until I unlocked the Sherman.

I'm not sure I can say it's the fault of /r/news or people posting here, but there's too many articles with good headlines and shit bodies these days. I've posted stuff here and had to link to or quote blogs on the same subject because they had more info but weren't allowed to be the OP.
It's...the legendary Super Tengu!
I'm pretty sure the grandfather's axe or Ship of Theseus paradox involved things replaced completely. In the case of the TKIV, the receiver, the serialized part, is from an antique rifle potentially from 1893.
Which gun control measures? You mean the Social Security thing? That was a due process issue that even the ACLU couldn't ignore.
I'll just list it:\n\nM2 (1.3), M3A1 Stewart (1.3), M2A4 (Reserve 1.0), M3 Lee (2.7), M13 MGMC (1.3)\n\nBefore this all started, I had the M4A1 (3.3) where the M2A4 was.

As much as I am shocked at the current administration, I'm more afraid that this will lead to a major alt-left movement for 2020 to rectify everything done by Trump and the Republican Congress. I don't think we will see normalizing any time soon. 
Does this math kick in once I unlock a tier 2 or something?

Dude, Homura tried that millions of times. Bullets and fire don't do shit to it.
Now I see they're all similar BR. But why these new maps all of a sudden? It's all Conquest 3 now instead of 1, and on maps I've never seen before and most of my tanks have issues traversing.\n\nEDIT: Nope, new mission and all are 3.0 or higher now. Did something change because I unlocked the Sherman?
Can confirm. Am valet in Miami, like to drive rich people cars. Sometimes I know more about the car than the owner does, like where the button on some BMWs to fold the side view mirrors is, or how to mute the radio on a Mercedes without deactivating the backup camera. 
Read it as "we will show you how to design lead" on the first pass through.
Mercedes in a nutshell. So many features in the cars over the years are so badly designed. Every model has a warning on the dash to not forget your keys, even when it's one where you had to insert the key to start it. Some models from a few years ago had the cruse control handle above the directional arrow handle, so you would fumble with that uselessly trying to signal left.\n\nThey aren't alone in the world of bad designs. Cadillac's have a fucking awful control system that uses [panels instead of buttons to change the volume or mute the radio.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4_vysJCtELA/maxresdefault.jpg) You end up bruising your fingers trying to change channels.
BUT REMEMBER TO STEER! 
DEUS LO *VULT!!!
One reason why I don't get why people like him. 
Did I come off as being in favor of the assault weapons ban? That wasn't my intent, I was just stating that there are various reasons why the world at large wants the US to be stable. I don't think access to ARs destabilizes the US, as like you said it's not a major killer in this country (neither are handguns in terms of major causes of death, but they are the preferred tool for homicide). Economic stability and other social issues will be what creates tension.
It wasn't doing this to me for a full damn month. Something is broken here if it think I can fight against tier 2 tanks in reserve level Japanese tank all of a sudden.

They've been part of the DOJ since the 2002 Homeland Security Act was signed. \n\n>In the wake of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In addition to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the law shifted ATF from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice. The agency's name was changed to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. However, the agency still was referred to as the "ATF" for all purposes. Additionally, the task of collection of federal tax revenue derived from the production of tobacco and alcohol products and the regulatory function related to protecting the public in issues related to the production of alcohol, previously handled by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as well as by ATF, was transferred to the newly established Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), which remained within the Treasury Department. These changes took effect January 24, 2003. \n\nWikipedia

It's a fucking retarded design if you ask me.

It's hard to disprove that people who would want near or complete bans aren't either leading the charge or have lots of power.

I meant more along the lines of playing while my child's playing and yelling in the mic that I fucked his mom if he starts crassly shit talking the other team...\n\nI mean I know the working struggle. I'm a dev. 
He got hired by google well after leaving 4chan. Leaving 4chan was probably because the fappening and gamergate occurred almost simultaneously. It didn't help that he was tied into the "middle crust society" of techdom (which is what most on the chans were mad about. Not just that he was cucked, but it seemed he made changes because the girl he was being cucked by was higher up in GAWKER. It additionally seemed she was using him to influence the site )\n\nSo between all the shit he was getting from his IRL pals, and the fact his older userbase was fuming I cannot blame him. 
Yeah, bruderhof isn't a very well known one, but they're also known as The Community. Basically a set of communes in multiple parts of the world, mostly Europe. There's one in Albany, though, and I had the pleasure of meeting them. \n\nThey pay for their peeps to get educated, and let them leave whenever they want without issue at least. Commune I saw had two doctors in it who grew up in Bruderhof communes, and plenty of former professionals. They also have their own classroom and it seemed like they took good care of their children, even if they restricted their own lives to an odd extreme. \n\nBasically, your description seemed very close to what I saw of the Bruderhof.
Apologies and filtering are good and all, but ideally there needs to be some sort of guarantee posts aren't edited without notice.\nModification of posts/comments without notice and ability to rewind could lead to putting words in others' mouths. Some sort of flagging system that cannot be circumvented, or at least given additional trust from outside the reddit dev team needs creating to truly put this to rest.
I just want to get my say and maybe get my view changed a bit.\n\nIt just seems like a weird clusterfuck. Milo is an asshole, but he was abused as a kid.  It kind of makes sense he believes that his 'relationship' as a teenager was good for him. If it was not, then it takes away the agency he has from his formative years. It's like a weird victim blaming thing. Victims of many sorts have differing coping mechanisms, and one is re-affirming their agency. People are yelling at a person that was abused as a child for their coping mechanism.\nAt the same time, it doesn't mean that he's right that the 'age of consent' should be pubescency. That's basically the optimal time to take advantage of anyone between the hormones and new confusing thoughts. \n\nThen we have people like Lena Dunham who literally wrote IN a book about molesting her younger sister while she was a teenager and her sister was pre-pubescent. That just seemed to slip under the mainstream radar when that occured. Yet, because Milo is an asshole, it's like it's okay that THIS is the route of attack on him. Not on his assholey views or his intentional trolling to infuriate others. His justification for his being abused as a child is his noose.\n\nEverything is just confusing. \n\nI guess my idea is that slamming him on his statement as hard as he's being seems almost cruel. Granted, he's spent his career saying stupid things, but this is literally slamming a child-abuse survivor for the way he's come to terms with it. Like a push for him to get therapy or something seems like it'd be a better course. Not slamming him as if he's an active pedophile who's pro diddling pre-adulthood boys. \nTrumpeters are yelling about context and what not that he didn't mean it. He definitely did, but it doesn't seem like a place of wanting to do children. Anti-Trumpeters are pushing the view he's an active pedophile when he probably isn't.\n\nAm I the one wrong here? Who's even right about things anymore when everyone is pushing their own damn narrative.

He goes and makes a fucking spreadsheet of his wife's excuses and pushes it in her face.\nGirl not feeling ignored by her partner? One of them has already done something stupid to exacerbate it to the point they're asking strangers for help.\n\nAdd to all of that the karma system. Ordinary problems don't get upvoted; they get answered and people passively scroll past. Crazy problems? Up to the top, where they get more answers and more views.

This has less to do with stars than to do with those who earn erratically/as they find work. \n\nIe: people in creative fields often dont have fixed wage work.\nAs in their earnings are based on negotiations and output. \n\nFrasier is just a notable example as his divorce occurred after some paydays setting his alimony rediculously high. But there are many examples with similar circumstances. \n\nA person working a small business.  Freelancers. Commission based artists. \n\nThey and many more can suffer issues related to low demand for their work. If their alimony is based on a high point, they can be screwed even if they were shewed at saving. 
Tell me about it. Being brown I have a front seat to it.\nSeveral weeks ago, I was getting my hair cut alongside my dad. Barber asks my dad if I'm his brother, dad states that I'm his son who's come to visit.\nAnd then some guy asks if I was held up at the airport simply because I'm brown. To which my dad repeatedly attempts to explain that 1: I'm a citizen 2: We're not from any of the countries involved 3: That I'm from around "here" and wouldn't have needed the airport in the first place.\nGuy somehow couldn't comprehend this somehow and kept trying to be "woke" about the struggle due to the airport\n\nThen more recently, was with my white girlfriend at a gay nightclub because it was her last week in the area before she traveled to Boulder for a project for a bit. Some guy picks a confrontation with her because she's a white girl. Gets on her case because when asked about politics stuff, she said that she didn't want to get involved ( because even though she marched and all sorts of things, she just wanted to have fun for her last couple days with her friends/bf ). Guy immediately calls her a trump supporter, starts harassing her. Tells her she's too much of a bitch to get a boyfriend, at which point she tells him I'm right beside her. He then gets in my face asking 1: If I hate people of color 2: If I know my girlfriend is a Trump supporter.\n\nHe then continually gets in her face trying to harass her out of the club. To simply end the confrontation without getting us kicked out so the night could be saved, I had to act like a goddamned stereotype. He kept talking about "White ignorance" and that if she wasn't involved, she was the problem and something about breaking chains. I had to agree with him, talk about possibly being put into concentration camps and the whole muslim registration thing to get him to stop with him acting as if he knows my life better than I do. \n\nAnd on the other side, I have people continuously acting as if my religion inherently = throwing gay people off roofs and all sorts of barbarity. It isn't the religion, it's all sorts of factors. The problem is the religion is part of the culture. There are plenty of people who can stand by the 5 tenants of Islam without demonstrating behaviors that have more to do with old arab culture than the religion.\nie: regarding women, the only time they actually need to be covered is in the mosque. Men also need to be covered, there's just no head covering. But the cultures of those areas dictate that women need to always be covered, not Islam. You don't see Bangladeshis wearing burkas, let alone always wearing hijjabs. \nAnd many places force their daughters into marriages when it's stated the woman must willingly enter marriages. \nIt's all sorts of contradictions, similarly to what one would see with evangelist interpretation. The problem is just that the culture of those areas become the version of Islam in itself.\n\nI just hate how regardless of where I am, there's some form of stupid racism. Either people think for me or just make assumptions.

>implying you could shoot it often
I definitely see the difference. In one case, a subject is making a proclamation that those in compromising positions have agency when really there are many circumstances out of their control. This can suppress those who feel they have lost their agency, let alone send a positive message for a crime that can drastically affect a victim's perception.\n\nIn the other, a woman growing up exploring their sexuality exhibited behaviors similar to grooming behaviors. Perhaps at 7, there is a lack of understanding. But by the time she was older, certain acts should not have been repeated if it was just exploring. She bribed her sister with both candy and dollar bills, and had stated she'd done it for a while. it only widens the span of time, let alone the masturbation. The problem on top of this is that she published these actions in a positive light. She portrayed her actions as good ones, if not at least not bad ones. Even when exploring my sexuality, I wasn't fapping by my sleeping sister. Even if I did, if I was going to write about it, it wouldn't be as if there was nothing wrong with it. Let alone considering those who may have been abused by siblings and seeing someone somewhat prominent portray actions they may have experienced in a positive light.\n\n I just don't see why the difference in reaction is as strong as it is. People took to her defense strongly, and she herself defended her statements. The only news media outlets harping on her actions were right wing echo chambers, whereas others gave her a public defense.\n\nIn the case of Milo, he has not pursued the younguns. He is a known victim of child abuse. And people are portraying him as if he was not the victim of child abuse but an active perpetrator. His statement itself is a bad statement and should be disagreed with. But he should not necessarily be portrayed as someone who hurts children. He isn't, but everyone talks as if he does. \n\nThat's the problem. Action without context vs. context without action.\n\nWhy does the statement of a person get taken out of full context of why it may have happened. Why do the statements of another get the opportunity to be contextualized?\n\nIt's appropriate to denounce the statement. It just doesn't seem right to portray him as a pedophile.\n\nMaybe between the crap my sister and I have been through, our perception is forever colored. But is there a problem how I've reached the conclusion I've reached from what I've stated?

I wouldn't say that. You generally reach endpoints similar to each other, but the context behind them has changed drastically.

It may be the attitude the Trump administration wants, as it invalidates attacks on him as much as it invalidates pro-trump pieces. But it doesn't help the media is playing into his hands if that's the case. The WSJ attacked PewDiePie for being an Anti-Semite, followed the bulky half of news organizations. How am I supposed to trust major news organizations when they put 3 journalists on a single story that's assuredly a hit piece and there's an internal mail list that was used to coordinate the story between outlets. Let alone the fact if the videos in question are watched, they weren't pro-nazi as much as portraying subjects in question as nazi-like. He wasn't yelling about securing a future for white children or any of that bullshit, let alone even hinting at it. He was comparing Keemstar to anti-semites; to Youtube Heros as facist, and at one point just pointing. If I can't trust sites on an accusation of this magnitude, what else do I trust when there's no other evidence for me to go over? What do I do when I cannot take them entirely on their word without exterior sources. At least with trump, there's people making statements and actions with trails that can be followed often enough. He's making his own noose.\n\nI make Anti-Muslim jokes AS a muslim half the time, let alone all the other racist/sexist/innapropiate jokes I drop. I'm more than aware of what prejudice is considering I got beaten up in Jersey right after 9/11; and I'm also aware a good part of my bad humor is coping with how things are. If I was in the limelight, it almost seems like I'd be painted as someone normalizing all sorts of things when my actions are easily ignorable by simply looking elsewhere.\n\nCognitive dissonance is a common symptom of a traumatic experience. I have a sister who was almost raped overseas in Bangladesh when we were much younger, and she swings from growing stronger from what she experienced to being extremely upset unprovoked, even now. How good is saying surviving attempted rape makes you stronger? Obviously it isn't but it's understandable where such a view comes from. You don't just say "they can't keep their story straight."\n\nYou can say a person is wrong. It doesn't make them an active proponent. My sister is not a rapist, she's still struggling. Milo doesn't molest children or teenagers as far as anyone knows, yet he's being portrayed as if he was an active pedophile.

But it also went for longer than that. \nThere's at least a 6 year gap. For money and the like to even work as a bribe, the kid would be 5ish. That puts her at 11 at some instances. Masturbation happens pubertyish short of her being abused and learning ahead of time. So somewhere between 11 to 13. And it continued for a while afterward. She was at least  around pubescent when the masturbation and the like occurred, let alone the bribing. \n\nEdit: Regardless, if the same arguments are being thrown around, it's still not good to normalize such behavior let alone the effects it may have had. It's safe to assume Dunham is probably not a pedophile, but has performed actions that even in her context are still somewhat disturbing, let alone to those who actually have been groomed and abused. Yet she states it in public record, her own dissonance. \n\nIf Milo is being shat on for his dissonance of his abuse as the one taken advantage of, what defense other than "She didn't actually engage her in sex" is there for behaviors that may have strongly affected her younger sister?

Bribing her sister to make out? \n\nIf I did any of those things near my sister, would it not be sexual assault on any level?
not with that attitude you don't ~<3
I think that's more than valid. It just seems like the general jist of everybody is that he's an active pedophile. People just see that "he's a pedophile" and not the fact his statement came not from a pulpit of righteousness but a defense on his views. It was an on the spot defense of himself on Joe Rogan. \nBasically, I agree his statement wasn't a good one. I disagree with it greatly. I also recognize the negative impact it has. \nHowever, the push back that he's a pedophile just seems extreme. At best, he's an insensitive idiot who needs therapy to deal with his agency issues regarding his childhood.
Anita was patient zero in a way. \nIf it wasn't for Anita's profitability, Zoe would likely not have used wizardchan to create a cult of personality around herself. \nWithout the wizardchan shenaniganry, her rise in the clique may not have occured. Her rise is what gave her exposure, in turn had her expose herself to others.\n\nWhich led to five guys, Grayson and Totilo claiming nothing was wrong, further investigation raising more issues eventually leading to Gamers are Dead.\n\nWhich then resulted in the larger GG vs. SJW schism when writers claimed the GG backlash was anti-woman stuff. This further led to "respectful nod" but more importantly the cuckening of Anthony Burch. The Cuckening of Burch led to the popularization of cuck in many parts of the internet.\n\nFurthermore, when parts of the right gave shelter to GGers, it created interest to others. Milo got his big break taking a stand for GG, which eventually transitioned him into the alt-right in general due to shared interest in free speech.\n\nThe same basic playbook played in GG was played in the election, what with hard spin to portray Trump as the incarnation of bigotry, which actually succeeded. Plenty of people who voted him in still think he's a buffoon, if many of the "It Should've Been Sanders" threads popping up count as evidence. But many more seem to have hated the Clinton playbook as much as Clinton herself. Many got ticked off at CTR, who's influence on the site is now almost impossible to disprove considering the difference in r polictics post-election. The push with celebs, money, and some level of patronization ("I get you're upset, but this is the right thing. Fall in line.") without any true care. Clinton ignored Wisconsin because she expected a fall in line. \n\nAnd I think it's because they begin to believe their own spin. Spin is just spin, not reality. But when all you read is spin, how can you tell?\n\nsimilar with GG, when it's evident there's a ton of spin, you begin to not beleive any of it at all, which brings us back to trump.

Certain parts of it had roots in gamergate\n\nThe popularization of "cuck" (at least you're not Anthony Burch)\nThe rise of Milo and to some extent Brietbart (and minor popluarization of the 'modern' alt right)\nThe spreading of media distrust in general (when msnbc, colbert, etc.. took sides against gg)\n\nfor a lot of people, gamergate was the first experience of hard media spin directly against a civilian bloc that tends to be pretty diverse.

To what extent are invented technologies created by human circumstances and technological development.\n\nBasically, what drove the invention of the car for instance? What combination of existing technologies and societal issues led to someone making a car? And then the innovations on top of it.\n\nI mean it seems like crock, but at the same time I feel like its helped me a little with innovating. I'm having issues figuring what my next personal project is, I think about issues and resources until I get something I wanna write.\n\nIt's kinda useless if you're not going into policy or innovation though. 
Half of that reason is the fact people aren't allowed to say anything connecting islam to the attack on these subreddits.\nThe banning results in all those thinking those thoughts banding together elsewhere and boosting the thought elsewhere.\n\nWhat sucks is that I'm muslim, and even I think that there is a high likelyhood of the perp being an islamist extremist. Issue being, from the news at least, while the majority of muslims may not be terrorists, it seems the majority of extreme acts are islamist in nature. Additionally, the ghetto collating of refugees and muslims into packed areas where they are unable to assimilate even a little just seems to make things worse. \n\nOnly thing I don't really get with the people yelling about islamists is the pushing of the islamist slant on the Turkey assassination. The guy is apparently muslim (yelling allah huakbar and what not), but it seems much more political in nature than religious. The banning of people saying otherwise removes any possibility of seeing opposing views.\n\nI recognize why those bannings occur, but I wish that they didn't. \nThen again I think /r/unexpectedjihad is funny, so I'm probably nowhere near the majority of those here in terms of veiws.

Well, I didn't pay attention to that cobble bug thread like 2 weeks ago or so, but I have experienced it once, everyone on my team except one guy just crashed to the desktop with no error at exactly the same time right off spawn, I run a 6700k @ 4.6GHz 16 gigs of ddr4 @ 2400MHz and a 1070 founders edition, I do not think it is an issue with a bad pc. I have no clue what it is, but I am almost positive it is not a pc issue. 
i mean, it isnt stuck, since you can boost up there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQxw-pX4dak here is a video that does some analysis from 6~ months ago
wat
yea i disabled it and i still have a lot of sounds that sound like shit that a few of my friends are not experiencing. Really annoying when i have the new shit turned off i still have to deal with shitty sounds from the new option
no shit he was joking, but he is annoying as fuck
ohh shit, well i was mistaken 
works fine for me still
what?
very true
idk man, its annoying and i have gotton countless kills because i can see someone through a smoke because of it, it needs to be fixed, but i dont think there is just one cause for it, so its harder to find out exactly why it happens and therefor harder to fix on Valves end
no
300+ constant
> This is a very commonly known bug, therefore I don't know why valve hasn't fixed this yet.\n\ninstead of fixing bugs valve adds new skins
chalk rounds are also DDs according to the ATF, and therefor require a $200 tax stamp for each chalk round
no..... you always need as many frames as you can get so animations are more smooth, please stop spreading this bs
https://www.uhaul.com/ that might help
the shittiest shitpost
thank you kind sir
yea, it has always done that, it even does it for me on 1080p on a 24 inch monitor, it cuts off like an inch on the right, valve doesnt care
okay? he is not banned on esea, so he can play open all he wants
this is odd, cause when i set mine to only friends can join, it stopped happening to me, have not got on in a hew hours to see if it still happens
3 fps cant see what is happening in mm

What can you get a cheap AR for right now? Like 600 or 700 bucks. Designing a new rifle and tooling up for manufacture would not make it cheap. And even then, i dont think a pump action 5.56 rifle that takes ar mags would be much cheaper than an ar. And what is the point of a pump action rifle that is marginally cheaper than an AR15.
spread out and try and work picks?
its not just the bullshit rng in the game, its the amount of damage pistols do. And the moving accuracy of the pistols, particularly the 5-7 and p250 are insanely high
NEW SKINS
i like it a lot, cause if i am in discord or something i use back mousebutton for ptt in it and i always accidentally back out of streams. I bet when BTTV gets their update out to fix the fullscreen issue they will add an option to disable it.
LUL Your 'friend' lied to you and you are quite frankly not very smart for believing that bulllshit. 
Fair enough.  :)
no idea, maybe verify game cache if that doesnt work reinstall if you have not tried it. It is probably a software error, but it could also be hardware, maybe play some other games and get into intensive situations and see what it is like usage wise\n
god damn hughes amendment plz go away
try 15k+ from my quick searches on classified ad sites that specialize in NFA
bullshit, that is what it is
no
PC SPECS PLEASE
they never changed their mind, it was never going to be open in the first place, the person who tweeted that out was misinformed and not even on the team
specs?
no
4k is 4 times as many pixels as 1080p, if you upscale 1080p on it, it will look like native 1080p, just like on your current monitor 
I think it also has to do with the molly smoke and the smoke grenades smoke interacting with one another, cause it also happens with grenade smoke, not sure though, it seems kind of random when it happens
Sorry I just woke up, i will do $30
They fixed one bug that was game breaking(alt tab crash, which was introduced with the giant update a few days ago), it is obvious they do not care about fixing the bugs that have been in the game for a long time because fixing bugs does not make money, releasing more skins and ugly ass glove skins that are as rare to open as a knife makes them money, so why would they fix bugs. 
QCK+
i also miss it, warmup used to be a fun time full of banter, but now its just boring, but its been gone for so long and I dont see valve ever bringing it back

I do not have mat_savechanges anywhere and I dont have gaming evolved enabled. I tried to fix it for like 5 hours yesterday and tried everything google turned up but nothing worked.\n\nEdit: this might help, but i dont know why it would matter, but it started happening after I installed my new 6700k
i was on globaloffensive and saw it there and then came here and thought i was having a weird case of deja vu

yea, for the first few days after the new sounds, i hated them so much, and now i hear the old sounds, and they hurt my ears so much, very glad they changed
You can queue with ranked people, but unless it is a 5 queue they have to be within i think 7 ranks of you, so for you max would be nova 2 i beleive that you can queue with unless you get a 5 queue then you can queue with any rank and it doesnt matter\n
go into game settings and change the default lobby privacy setting to only friends can join

Thats the great thing about capitalism, they would not be making money if people did not enjoy the product that they put out. They have every right to do whatever they please with their property. If you do not like how they run it, speak with your wallet, do not purchase any valve products if you do not agree with their way of doing things. 
fl0m said they are not open tryouts on his stream.
do not open cases, the odds are against you, the house always wins, just spend the $5 to buy a skin you want. If you open cases, you will lose your money, turn $2.50 into 10 cents.
got a link by chance? i cannot find it and i would love a fix
the sounds are still really bad, super annoying echo of all gunshots, really wish they would fix it.
w*at?
because twitch added new features with the player, so bttv has to add compatibility with it on the plugin
the ump has the same base damage and the famas(iirc, if not it is very close), it has insane armor penetration values, doesnt have a shitty spray pattern like the famas, gives you a $600 kill reward, and costs $1200. It is a better choice to than the famas unless you are taking long rage fights only. 
good for you

yea i saw something about it on TFB like a year and a half ago or longer and never saw anything else after that, just took it as truth like a dummy.
one of the best threads i have ever seen
type mat_info and look somewhere at the top and look 'Display Mode' and after that it will show the res you are playing and the refresh rate. For instance mine shows "Display mode : 1920 x 1080 @144Hz" this will help you see if it is running at 144hz or not
Yea I hope OP fixes them, i really like them and want to use them. u/Lbpsack 
yes
they are a twitch partner, the issue afaik is turners equipment is older and cannot do 1080p 60fps, or something like that, so it is 720p,.

i have the same issue, i disabled hrtf the second it came out because it sounded like shit, and then i played a game and all my sounds in game and in the lobby still sounded compressed and bad, and i have multiple accounts and not all of them have the same sound issues, and it is really annoying. 
iirc they have older equipment at turner and it runs hotter and is less efficient than new stuff would be, could be wrong on that though
I have never looked at my cpu and gpu usage numbers but i know csgo puts my cpu under about 40-50% load, not sure on my gpu, but it seems really high and very abnormal
well, yea, but the new sounds for the first few days were a downgrade for me, especially the awp sound, the thunder in the background took me a while to get used to. But now the new sounds are miles better than the old.
logitech has very good wirless technology in their gaming mice, never used one, but people say they have around the same latency as a wired mouse

>Whether mathematical theories are consistent is irrelevant to whether they have an objective mind-independent basis that we are obliged to accept.\n\nWell, we're not *obliged* to accept it.  It's certainly *useful*, but if you could come up with a new, fundamentally different methodology for mathematics that didn't share the same properties, it'd sure be interesting!  I don't know of any other systems of that nature, though - we have different based numerical systems (binary, octal, hexidecimal, etc), but mathematics as a logical construct to overlay upon them still applies.\n\n>So I'm really not sure why you are harping on consistency now.\n\n...because an objective morality would need consistency, would it not?  It needn't be absolute, but if it was inconsistent would it really be moral?\n\n>Also, the further up you go in mathematics and formal logic, the more contention and disagreement you see about the consistency and groundedness of basic axioms in those theories\n\n...oh well?  Academic disagreement isn't the same thing as demonstration that a primary axiom is demonstrably wrong.  It's all theoretical, but in the end 1 + 1 is still 2.\n\n>you would know this if you actually read the paper I linked\n\nI didn't.  Don't have the time to.\n\n>Furthermore, other historic cultures would likely not have accepted much of our mathematics or logic as valid \n\nAgain...  oh well?  We can still apply our properties and logic to their systems to come to the same conclusions, meaning that the fundamental basis of their mathematics is the same as ours.  1+ 1 is still 2, X/1 is still X, etc.\n\n>It is exactly like ethics in that sense.\n\nBut that's just us applying our particularized moral sensibility to their culture.  There's no logic saying that anything is particularly "good" or "bad", because logic doesn't make absolute moral judgements, that's us imposing our opinions.\n\n>And you never engaged with my point about ethics and epistemology and universal relativism.\n\n...because I didn't see the point in doing so, it doesn't address my primary point:  I still see no evidence of any objective source for morality.  All I'm seeing from you is arguments/appeals from consequences.
>Again, disagreement doesn't mean there is no fact of the matter.\n\nSo can you prove that there *is* a supreme moral authority we can all agree on?  Because that'd be a first for all mankind.\n\n>If that was true then even science and math would be subjective\n\nNot true, actually:  mathematics has logical proofs we can go to which demonstrate the inviolability of certain principles.  For science, it's entirely based on evidence, and the theories we hold as most accurate are those that best describe the available body of evidence without being contradicted.\n\n>Ok, so where do those intuitions and perceptions come from and why can't they be understood as a basis for objective morality?\n\nOur evolutionary ancestry as social animals, most likely, but that remains to be determined, as evolutionary psychology is [a very young field that's mostly bullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5tg2r7/what_are_your_views_on_evolutionary_psychology_is/ddmgh8w/).  As for a basis as "objective" morality, that would at best be "human" morality, and even then, it would really be just a subset of behaviors that collectively helped those groups of humans that were pre-disposed to those behaviors (much as wild dogs or monkeys might have similar behaviors as pack animals)  survive - not exactly the sort of thing I necessarily want to have as a basis for an enlightened modern morality.\n\n>remember that all of our natural science is based on human perceptions and commonsense intuitions\n\nNot really, actually.  Much of modern science isn't commonsense, it's counter-intuitive - especially when you delve in to deeper physics or quantum physics.  It's not subjective, that's why we rely on evidence, but it's human perception is ruled out as much as possible through the use of either multiple experiments or the use of instruments that capture the reality of the situation for us (electron microscopes, for example - or the really mind-bending particle detection apparatus in the LHC).\n\n>Not actually true, I don't know where you heard that.\n\nThink about it:  in an objective morality, a specific crime has a specific punishment.  It's *rigid*.  Look at the Koran - you steal, you lose a hand, period:  there's nothing in there about debate, or the circumstances of why you'd do such a thing - to do other than the proscribed punishment is attempting to subvert the divine command of god.\n\n>Moral particularism, however, is the stance that the objectively correct ethics is context-dependent\n\nThat sounds a lot like subverting the will of the ultimate moral authority.\n\n>You have no real justification for obeying these if you don't believe they have objective force.\n\nSure I do:  enlightened self interest.  I *want* a world where there is as little suffering as possible, because that also applies to me.\n\nEdit:  added link - DarwinZDF42 is a biology professor

>Yeah, I don't see why this matters. The point is that just because they evolved in response to the environment doesn't make them completely subjective.\n\nDifferent environmental factors would create different morality, then.  That hardly sounds objective to me.\n\n>You're still not getting it; it means that science is dependent on normative considerations, just like ethics.\n\nI don't see any reason to assume that any objective source of morality exists, though.  The American Humanist association does a very good job of explaining the whole situation [here](https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/human-basis-laws-ethics/) - suffice it to say, we can have a very beneficial system of ethics that does not rely on any objective source for morality.\n\n>Yes there is, otherwise there would be no reason to choose those particular theories over any other nonsense you could think up that is internally logically coherent and fits the evidence.\n\nThat's just the thing - there *are no other competing theories*.  Those theories are the best explanations we have *right now*, but that doesn't mean they're *right*, they're just *less wrong* than anything else we know.\n\n>Yes they do, because those inputs feed into our brains.\n\nBut the inputs themselves are measured objectively.  Said objective measurements can be shared, especially with those who don't want to accept their consequences, and the experiments can then be repeated - which then reduces/eliminates bias, as Peer Review tends to do.\n\n>We could very well one day discover that all our results from some machine or other were systematically biased due to some unknown effect.\n\nSure - that's why we like multiple lines of independently cross-checking lines of evidence.\n\n>all observations are theory-laden\n\nIndeed.  There's nothing wrong with that - the observations and conclusions based upon them are still less wrong than anything else we've got, and in the end that's all we can realistically hope for.\n\n>An objective ethics is simply an ethics that is independent of the arbitrary preferences of any agent.\n\nObjective morality is the perspective that there are things about the universe that make certain morals claims true or false.  It's an Absolutist form of morality, because those things are *always* true or false...  but even if we go back to evolutionary psychology (and I hesitate to do so), different environmental factors then lead to a different morality, which is *decidedly not objective*.
Modern ~~conservatives~~ Republicans are only for local government control when it means that they can use it to push their own agenda without getting national scrutiny.
>They may trump hurt feelings, but they don't trump morality\n\nMorality is subjective man.  We here say ISIS is Evil, but they think they're righteous, and that the West is evil.  Nobody paints themselves as the bad guys, after all.\n\n>and they don't trump self-defensive action, which all anti-fascism is for the potential victims of fascism.\n\nSo far, the Nazis here haven't done anything illegal, have they?  So it's not self defense.  As a CCW holder, you learn that line pretty clearly.  If they were planning/advocating illegal action, that'd be one thing - but that's also a matter for the *police*, not an angry mob.\n\n>Everyone is equally obligated to not be a fascist.\n\nI don't recall reading that in the Constitution...  see, we don't have "thought crimes" on the books, last I checked.\n\n>...but they still did the morally right thing and should be treated leniently.\n\nSee, that's where the constitution disagrees with you, specifically the 14th amendment.

Damn dude....  just...  wow.
I really just want the surround sound.  Watching Amazon videos with no bass just kinda sucks.
So long as they're obeying the law, they should have nothing to fear:  we shouldn't seek to actively silence those we disagree with, we should *engage them in debate*.  That's how you change *their* minds.  Just punching them in the face isn't going to do anything to solve the problem, and it's not going to do you any favors either when you're convicted of battery.  They're citizens too, they deserve the protection of the law as much as anyone, and we can't just selectively enforce the law:  it either applies to all of us, or it applies to none of us.  As abhorrent as their bullshit is, they have the right to say it, and they have the right to equal protection under the law.\n\nIt's easy to just say they should be silenced.  It's much harder to engage them.  Somewhere along the line it became impolitic to talk about politics person-to-person, to discuss things calmly and rationally.  Do you think it might be that very phenomenon that has led us to our current situation?
The purpose of the first wish to to actively preempt malicious action...  so unless the book can subvert a wish that removes subversion, it's kinda moot.

>the propaganda is the precursor to the planning which is the precursor to the genocide.\n\nBut one is illegal and the other isn't.  There's nothing wrong with spreading a political message, distasteful as it might be.  The second it goes to planning an illegal act, that's when it crosses the line.\n\n>we oppose it because it is almost certainly an objective moral evil.\n\nI don't believe in objective morality, but I have the same general feelings about Nazis (most any rational person would!).  HOWEVER, it's not illegal to be an idiot, racist toolbag.  So long as that's all they're being, all they're doing, they're still protected by the law.  That doesn't stop one from taking great pleasure in *enthusiastically* arresting them when they cross the line, but they still have to cross the line!\n\n>...just for the grassroots community itself to violently expel them from civil society.\n\nI agree with that entirely, except for the "violently" part.  By all means, make them social pariahs.  Reserve the right to refuse them service, shun them socially, make them outcasts who can't even buy groceries without going far enough out that nobody recognizes them... but keep it *legal*, that's all I want.
That's a very good point, and one that I had forgotten entirely - thanks!
:)  Yeah, anything going in to the book is going to get looked over for specifics.  I suppose one of the first things to mention will be "unless otherwise specifically stated, any further wishes written in this book that reference velocity, location, or time, will be referring to such in relation to the frame of reference of the writer."
They ought to do that for commercials - show people dropping them, rolling over them with cars, all that good stuff.

Delete it out of his "sent items" and go about your day.  If this doesn't get him canned, escalate.
That'll just plain fuck over anyone who drives all over for his business...  spending a shitload of money in MO if he happens to drive mostly out of state.
Pretty much, yeah.  I hesitate to mention it, but there's a great FanFic out there called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, where Harry has a bit of a different upbringing and applies rational/scientific methodology to magic...  it's complete, well written, and fairly long.  I recommend it, if you like what I did there. :)

There are exactly three variants that were ever legal for common civilian ownership, and only two of those are legal for civilian ownership now.  All of these variants fire pistol rounds in Semi-Automatic mode only, and despite their popularity in Hollywood, they've never been popular in the US.

I seem to recall the Dremel that runs around on his back calling him "Ty" or "Tie" or "Thai" or something, but I had no idea he had a last name.\n\nI don't really watch it much - when it's on in the evenings, I tend to be cooking in the kitchen.
...do we really want to be in the same shit-show as North Carolina, that lost billions of dollars in revenue thanks to their idiocy?
My kid also likes Dinosaur Train, which is just so absurd it's funny.
...neither does punching someone, really.\n\nI think their ideology is disgusting, but I'll defend their right to espouse it.  Equal protection under the law, and all that...  coupled with the first amendment, which exists specifically to protect *unpopular* opinions...
Wow.\n\nI had no idea it was that bad.  I mean, I'm making that $1600 about weekly, so I'm doing OK personally (especially as I live in the midwest, where the cost of living is much lower than on the coasts)...  but I have no idea how you can get by on that little!  Food stamps & other government programs?  That's below-the-poverty-line levels of income!  :(
Ug, no.\n\nLook, they engage in any planning or activity that would cause that sort of harm, and they get taken down hard.  That's ALSO in the law.\n\nBut they the same rights as we do as citizens, and that includes equal protection under the law.  We can't just selectively enforce the law because an idea offends us.\n\nEdit:  It doesn't even have much to do with principles - just consequences.  Think about it - if we open the doors to selective enforcement of the law just because we don't like someone or some idea, how soon will it be until that sort of selective enforcement is turned against people who happen to be in opposition to the minority party?  Oh, you want to take my guns away?  \\*BAM\\*  It's OK officer, he's a liberal, he had it coming!

Well, you've gotta be careful with this sort of artifact - it's almost certainly a monkey's paw sort of item, that will grant wishes in the worst possible way.\n\nSo, draft up a first wish that forces the artifact to grant wishes in the way they were meant by the writer, without malicious unintended side-effects or follow-on effects that would be considered "bad" in any way by the wisher.  No causing death or physical/psychological harm, basically.\n\nAfter that, wish that there was always at least one more blank page in the back of the book - either via magical pages or through an expanding spine - so you'd never run out of wish-room.\n\nFinally, some tests.  Low-grade, VERY SPECIFIC stuff, like "I wish a pebble of igneous stone, weighing precisely 100 grams, of the sort commonly found on our planet would materialize on the sidewalk in front of <insert street address here> twenty minutes (relative to my frame of reference) after I finish this sentence."  Then get some good distance from that area, wait twenty minutes, then go find the pebble.  Pick it up with tongs, and test it thoroughly (no radiation, no contact poison, nothing harmful about it, etc.).  Ramp up tests to larger items, set up recording equipment to see how such materialization occurs, and have future tests specify the same method of materialization, to avoid unintended changes/consequences that could have detrimental effects.\n\nAfter sufficient testing to determine that materialization of physical objects could be done without harm, and that the "monkey's paw" aspect of the artifact had been neutralized effectively/never existed in the first place, use it specifically for that purpose alone.  If other effects are needed in the future, sufficient testing & wish-drafting must be done to minimize chances for unfortunate outcomes.\n\nEdit:  readability
I *think* that's an Anime?  I've heard of it, but no:  haven't seen it.
Goddamn!  That lady's comment was *ON POINT*!
I believe that would be covered by the first wish.  "...or follow-on effects that would be considered "bad" in any way by the wisher."\n\nHonestly, such a limitation, keeping it from harming anyone, is probably the best thing you could do with such a device.  Causing death and destruction isn't something anyone should ever be able to do lightly.
Yeah, I checked that too before posting, and that was my conclusion too (Poe being a Troll, of course).
Dude, forget that - just say "scientists figured out a means of duplicating a lizard's ability to regrow limbs in humans.  Trials complete, you can now regrow lost limbs in months with a simple injection!"
>You and your liberal ilk don't really believe in right and wrong\n\nGot some news for you buddy:  I'm not a liberal.  I simply believe the law should apply to everyone equally.  Is that really too much to ask?\n\n>You are afraid of righteous violence\n\nNo, I simply believe that we are a nation of *laws*, and the law trumps (no pun intended) hurt feelings.\n\n>You unquestioningly accept the coercive violence of the law\n\nWrong again, I'm an active participant in /r/bad_cop_no_donut and /r/amIfreetogo.\n\n>god forbid you actually go and challenge the men with the guns\n\nI *AM* one of the men with the guns.  Most days either a Glock 19 or a Ruger LCP.\n\n>People like you are cowardly and disgusting\n\nBecause I believe that the law should apply to everyone equally?  Come on man, be *civil*.
For RPGs, generally no.  It makes having conversations with others about said RPG difficult in the future:  You're talking about Slicey-McSpikeyHair, and your friend is referring to Cloud Strife.  In a game like Dwarf Fortress, though - hell yes, because when I discuss it with friends, I tell them about how their namesake dwarf did something incredibly stupid and died horribly.
> That isn't how mathematics actually works though. The "basic principles" of mathematical theories ...\n\nThe point is that we can apply the same theories we have now to earlier numerical systems and they will apply.  Mathematics is *consistent* like that.\n\n>Mathematical fictionalism\n\nDoesn't really apply here.  The basic claim of objective morality is that there exists some moral authority external to humanity that can define a universal "good" and "bad" that we're obliged to accept...  but I see no *evidence* of that.  We have cultural definitions of good and bad, and they're normative within said cultures, but we have cultures that clash as well, with both cultures thinking they're morally in the right.  When it comes to mathematics, though, we can demonstrate through logical proof that the various underlying principles are consistent - we **have** evidence for this...  but try to do that with morality, and it'll all fall apart because nobody is going to agree on the source of that external moral authority, and as such the definition of what is and isn't morally "good" is going to change.  Numbers may have different representations, but they mean the same thing, because they're grounded in logic - but if we had a universal definition of "good" then we'd have a lot fewer conflicts in the world.
The Witcher.\n\nYeah, the first one, with the shitty combat system and clunky animation.  The story was so damned good I didn't care.
Awwww, poor piggy hasn't gotten to beat anyone in to unconsciousness lately?

Unfortunately ir might do so by slamming a tablet out of the sky towards your face. You have just enough time to read the rules before it landed upon you.  Preemptively acting to restrain any bad behavior seems like the safer choice.

Well, to be fair, the "microscopic" amount of belladonna wouldn't have had any effect on your little one:  the "active ingredient" in most homeopathic remedies is best measured in particles per cubic *light-year*.  If she'd actually gotten **any** of the belladonna, it would be miraculous - and also completely impotent.
Glock 21 IIRC, in a frame that gives it a shoulder stock and front grip.  Technically at that point it's what's called a short-barreled rifle. I've used it a few times, and it should not be that easy to put 45 caliber rounds that accurately down range. It's ridiculously fun to shoot.
Probably. :)
>Math is also very different in different cultures. For example, math in Ancient Greece was considered equivalent to geometry and basic number theory; they couldn't envision the subject independent from ideal spatial forms and almost never made use of, say, algebra.\n\nSure, but the same concepts held true, even if they viewed it differently.  If they had a precise number system, the properties of mathematics still held true - identity, additive, etc.\n\n>You don't think numbers exist? Does that mean you're a fictionalist?\n\nNumbers are abstract concepts.  We have symbology to represent them (the symbols we write on paper that represent the numbers), but those are arabic-origin symbols - other languages have other numerical symbols with the same meaning.  It's not as though I can point to some physical representation of the square root of negative two, for example, but we use such concepts in mathematics.\n\n>What is "cross-checking with reality" even supposed to mean?\n\nLet's say we're doing some mathematics to plan out a building - we can cross-check our math with physical boards of measured length to see if our math is correct, if we'll actually have a usable structure.  Similarly, we can do mathematics to figure out the value of Pi, but we can cross check that against a physical circle to measure the ratio of the radius vs. the circumference to see if it's correct (within the margin of error between our physical circle and a perfect circle, of course).\n\n>There are plenty of mathematical fields today that have no real-world applications or interpretations at all.\n\nSure, but the basic principles of math are easily checked.  If we build upon those, and if the logic leading to the other fields is sound, we can be reasonably confident that the field is at least logically consistent.\n\n>This is precisely what I'm saying is not possible, because the same arguments against moral realism can be used against any other field just as effectively.\n\nSo, given that my argument against moral objectivism is that I see no evidence of any objective source of morality, what's the turn-around to mathematics?

Go to the COO:\n\n"The way I see it, you've got 2 options.  First, you give me an immedaite raise, benefits, and promotion to Head of HR.  I'll get you the employees ASAP, but I'll do it my way - the other girl is going to be *my* assistant, and I'll need her in the building.  Your other option is to do it your *damn self*, because I won't be here, meaning you'll have precisely nobody trained to handle the workload I'm dealing with.\n\nSo, which is it going to be?"
I'd still have to write things down for wishes to work, of course.
Be excellent to each other!
...has it occurred to you that we're *REALLY* off topic?
>At the very least can you make a rational argument as to why you think morality is subjective?\n\nBecause there's no supreme moral authority we can all agree on.  Lots of people here in the US say it's their god.  Lots of folks in the Middle East will say the same thing, but get in to specifics and you'll get a WIDE range of different opinions, all backed up by supposedly "holy" books that purport to be the word of a supreme moral authority, most of which will be contradicted by different "holy" books, and oftentimes within the very same book.\n\nWe as humans have morality that seems to generally work well for us as social animals.  Ideas like "No Murdering" and "No Stealing" work well for the most part, but even those will have regional and historical variance - the Aztecs though that all their human sacrifice was good and moral thing to do, but we look at it in horror.  Native Americans used to think very little of stealing from a competing tribe (they might even applaud the act) - but you'd better not steal from your *own* tribe.\n\nPersonally, I don't want objective morality - because objective morality means there's no room for mercy.  I want morality that is argued, reasoned, and takes the entire situation in to account, working towards a goal of least harm first, then most benefit second, but those goals are distinctly *human* goals, and even then subjective towards the society in which they exist.  We like to think of ourselves as very advanced morally, but in a thousand years what do you suppose humanity, if it still exists, will think of some of our practices and behaviors?  Surely they'll look at some of what normally we do as completely barbaric, and to think otherwise is completely hubristic.\n\n>And besides, if you don't believe in objective ethics then what rational argument can there be to prove that we ought to follow the law in the first place?\n\nBaysean Decision Theory and Utilitarian Ethics.  The "Golden Rule".  Hell, even enlightened self interest.  There are plenty of good reasons to follow the law - just as there are lots of good reasons for the law to encourage good behavior.
>Encouragement of criminal activities is against the law in my country.\n\nI don't believe most modern Nazi adherents actively want to engage in genocide - could be wrong on that, it's not exactly something I do any research on - but I agree with you:  if they're encouraging illegal behavior, they should be stopped.  However, being a racist toolbag isn't illegal.  Stupid, socially unacceptable, and scientifically unsound...  but not illegal.\n\n>It's pretty impossible to persuade someone through debate. Science proved it. Our brain istinctively protect us by refusing to listen if the pillars of our character are challenged.\n\nEven if it doesn't change their minds, it can change the minds of people who are undecided.  When you make them look foolish, show them to be ignorant, and defeat their arguments at every turn, it becomes very hard for them to recruit.  *They* may not change their minds, but they'll also eventually die from natural causes.  Their ideology then dies from attrition.\n\n>Oh really, you're throwing out already the "you're the real fascist" argument?\n\nNO!  Not at all!  That was more a general commentary on how we, as a society, don't debate with each other anymore - it's considered "rude", isn't it?  It used to be that neighbors could talk politics, politely disagree about something, and still respect each other.  When was the last time any of us did that?  And now our current political climate is becoming more extremist on both sides, with no respect or civility for people on the other side of the aisle, leading to less and less cooperation...  it's *sad*.  I'm not calling you, or *anyone* a fascist!  Well...  except the actual fascists (the Nazis, in this case, I suppose).  Fuck those guys. :)
At some point, yeah - but that's not something an angry mob should decide, that's something to be argued in court.
So, gerrymandering is good because it subverts democracy?\n\nI can't tell if you're a Poe or not!

> It's a necessary assumption for anything in ethics to make sense\n\nNot at all.  [Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_morality) - the idea of subjective ethics is as old as the idea of agnosticism.\n\n>In other words, a normative epistemic value judgement about what is "best"?\n\nYes.  There is debate, of course, among competing theories...  but such debate is usually short-lived in the scientific community as theories must be falsifiable, so then effort is spent on attempting to falsify one or the other competing theory - or both!\n\n>And as for math, if you think there are no persistent controversies in mathematics then you just haven't studied it at a high enough level.\n\nI'm aware of some high-level unanswered questions, but the beauty of mathematics is that eventually, if there is a solution, there will be a proof to go along with it.\n\n>So, kind of like our empirical senses and our ability to reason?\n\nNot quite.  Behavioral tendencies with a basis in evolutionary psychology, epigenetics or just plain genetics, are *tendencies*.  We can derive certain norms that we find beneficial to the survival of the group, but beyond that you venture outside the realm of established science and in to bullshit.\n\n>No it's still intuitive and commonsensical\n\nThere's nothing intuitive or commonsensical about quantum randomness, Hawking Radiation, Special Relativity, overcoming Survivorship Bias, and more - there's a great deal within science that's just plain difficult to grasp intuitively.\n\n>Seriously? Multiple experiments are an aggregation of perceptions.\n\nNo.  When the same experiment is performed multiple times and keeps getting the same result, that's *evidence* that has ruled out the bias of the experimenters.  That's a fundamental cornerstone of the Scientific Method:  Peer Review.\n\n>Instruments are an extension of perceptions\n\nNo they're not - we have no perceptions that can detect a Higgs Boson, for example...  but even if we did, it's immaterial, because while our human perceptions might be subject to error with our wonderfully self-deceiving meatbrains, such biases don't exist in an oscilloscope, or in a chromatograph, or a genetic sequencer.\n\n>and even come with theoretical and methodological assumptions embedded in their use.\n\nSure, but that's to make sure they're used correctly in context.  They're tools, and just like you don't want to use a hammer to pound in a screw, you don't want to use carbon-dating to measure the age of marine fossils:  it's inappropriate for the job.\n\n>Well then its a good thing that secular ethics is based on reasoned inquiry and makes itself open to contestation\n\nWhich means it's not objective.\n\n>Which is bullshit. The moment harming other people is in your "self-interest" you won't be behaving in a very "enlightened" way anymore.\n\nIncorrect - because I don't want a world where such behavior can then be turned back against me.  There's also human empathy to take in to consideration.
Oh for sure, it's a weird concept, but if you get over that it's not half bad as a kid's show.  I particularly like that the good guys don't solve their problems by violence most of the time - they solve them by building stuff, working together to fix things, and in the end their overall situation is better than when they started.  It's a nice lesson for kids to learn, IMO.
I wonder what Beethoven would think if he could hear that.
Hell, we're a very long flight from anywhere that speaks anything other than English, for the most part... and most folks don't *want* to go to our southern neighbor, what with all the violence.\n\nThat's why we don't learn other languages: no chance to practice them, thus no retention.
Well yeah - a proper education in physics is important!
That's a fair point...  requires more thought.
> Unless, you know, different environments and situations objectively require you to do different things. That's how a particularist objective ethics works.\n\nI guess I just don't buy that morality can be both particularist and objective at once.  Objective morality is, to my understanding, *absolute*.  If it can change, it if can be reasoned or mitigated, it's no longer objective.  I mean, I suppose you could have a much more complex objective system that accounted for *everything*, but that sounds like the sort of thing you'd need an omniscient agent to justify.\n\n>The fact that rejecting it would seem to require you to commit yourself to either complete relativism or rational inconsistency is probably a good enough reason to assume it exists.\n\nThat's fallacious reasoning - [Appeal to Consequences fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences).\n\n>The most defensible understanding of how it works metaphysically is just a platonic realm of abstract moral facts\n\nThat which is asserted without evidence...  see, I can demonstrate that mathematics exists, as an abstract concept, and then using proofs I can build up to our modern understanding of said mathematics from there.  For Morality...  moral proofs don't exist.\n\n>If you ditch commonsense rules of thumb like parsimony there's literally no limit to the bullshit you can make up, and no way to determine what the "best" explanation is.\n\nWe can of course use Ockham's Razor (parsimony) as you said, but there exists a great deal within science that is decided counter-intuitive, and the point of what I'm saying here is that while such things are useful on a foundational level, they're actually detrimental at other times.\n\n>or a logical contradiction in assuming that morals are subjective but math, logic, and nature are objective.\n\nI don't see any logical contradiction here.
I'm with your grandparents, man.  I grew up here in the US, and I've never really been entertained by Baseball, even when I was playing Little League as a kid.
>destroying their economy.\n\nnot that they had much economy to begin with...

Ooooh, good call.\n\nEdit:  I'd specify that any such device/AI would A.) know everything there is to know about the book, and B.) will not lie to me or otherwise attempt to mislead me.
Honestly, it's...  ok.  I like the animation, but the action is a bit inconsistent.  The main character, can't remember his name, can swing that beefy wrecking ball and knock holes in the ground or smash through rock walls...  but swing it against a bad guy and it just knocks him around a bit.  WTF are these things made of that they don't even get a dent?
>Well your understanding is simply wrong. All that "objective" refers to in analytic philosophy is a standard independent of the preferences of any agent.\n\nFine then.\n\nI still see no reason to believe that any such independent standard exists.\n\n>Calm down fallacy man, no it isn't.\n\nIt's the very definition of an appeal to consequences.  You used an argument that said that "well, the alternatives are either X or Y, so we'd best just assume Z is true".\n\n>I'd imagine that 1) you aren't a relativist or have much sympathy for postmodernism\n\nI *am* a moral relativist, because nobody has yet proven that there is an objective source for morality (be it a god or anything else) - we have our SUBJECTIVE experience that we can define as good or bad as we chose, and that definition is largely dependent on cultural upbringing.\n\nI'm not a relativist for any other field, however - mathematics, based off logic, is well supported.  I know numbers themselves don't exist, but I can play by the same rules as someone else and come to the same conclusions as someone else, and we can cross-check those rules with objective reality to determine if the rules themselves are useful.  For morality, however...  there's no such cross-checking, because there's no universal definition of moral good.  A fundamentalist muslim would say it's a good thing for women to be kept barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, whereas an American feminist SJW might say it's a good thing for that muslim to be castrated slowly with a rusty spoon in public...  and my opinion is that neither one of them is right - but is my opinion inherently more valid than either of theirs?  I can say my opinion might be more beneficial for an equitable society, but that's my personal value judgement that an equitable society is a "good" thing, and it's obviously not one that is universally shared.\n\n>Yes they do, analytic philosophy is full of them.\n\nSo what is the definition of "moral good" then?

This seems to be where I'm at as well. I have all the gear, just not the greatest versions of them that allow me to progress. I guess it's just farming for ancients and upgrade mats until I have better gear?
I'm very happy with the progression rate as it is now, but I consider myself a more hardcore gamer in terms of understanding the grind. I've played games like EQ2 where it took longer to just level up to 70 then it does to reach solo grift 80+. A ton of people play much more casually than we do because they don't have the time, maybe they had kids and don't have time now. PTR drop rates are fun as fuck when you don't have the time, and I think there could be a "casual ladder" where drop rates are increased and stat rolls have higher range values. Just a suggestion, but I think that would appease a lot of the players who are screaming on forums to make the game more eazymode while not destroying the game we currently have.

> they are done with the game because of how little loot hunt there is.\n\n>  \n  \nI sort of agree. You can have the same items you would need for grift 100+ after just a few days, but they won't be ancient or rolled well. I enjoy this system, as I can't curse RNG for never giving me a starmetal kukiri anymore. Now I just say "damnit why isn't my bakuli belt rolled ancient?". It gives everyone access to all builds and playstyles, but doesn't let you faceroll t13 in a week. If you look at D2, it had so much less diversity, and I still argue that it is a better game than D3. In D2, you could end game run hchaos or baal runs. Maybe kill ubers. But every time it was the exact same monsters with the exact same map setup.
I've risked my life for much less.
Couldn't Trump just increase tariffs and taxes accordingly so that Mexico makes up the difference? I don't expect Mexico to sign on the dotted line for this but if they amortize it over 20 years by "putting America first" in terms of trade deals and economic policies I see this as totally doable with or without Mexico's agreement.
HT Garg WD no question. It's the most boring build but it is so damn effective. Make's it almost impossible to die but you get to press a button every 10 seconds.
Anyone else find HT Garg is like watching paint dry? Every skill has a cooldown and even with spirit vessel I find myelf just standing around a lot and watching my pets kill stuff. It's impossible to die but it's just plain boring to me. I find jade or firebats with angry chicken to be much more fun, even if I die more often.

Preface: Start with 10x  \nDon't do full 120x bong rips  \n  \n  \nI was on the top balcony at the beach of a 4 story rental unit. I took a full bong hit of 120x, and instantly as I exhaled, I had this feeling in my soul that I needed to get the hell out of there and back to safety. I dropped the bong and luckily my friend was there to catch it. As I was running down 2 flights of stairs, everything was suddenly made out of legos. I was in an entire world made out of legos, sprinting for my life, and every time I closed a door behind me the entire room would fall apart just like on Mythbusters when the giant lego cube they rolled down a hill just collapsed. Each room I left was just no longer in reality. I finally made it to my room and stared at a picture of a cactus for 15 minutes until I felt ok again.  \n  \nSalvia - 6/10  \nDoing too much salvia - 2/10

Met a girl at Mardi Gras in New Orleans and got engaged by making her a ring out of a 20 peso bill I always kept in my wallet.
If you do let me know! Sounds awesome.

I'm confused why this guy admits to breaking the rules set forth by twitch and is now complaining that his game isn't allowed. If you are driving in a group of 20 cars and you are all speeding, but you are the only one who gets pulled over are you going to tell the cop "But you let all the other people speed why am I getting in trouble?". This guy goes into explicit detail on why his game is banned, listing the reasons. I fail to see the problem here.
So its useful to have this on WD HT Garg build follower?
This is spot on, and I would suggest making two WDs. Your HT Garg WD is going to let you get gear/shards/gems by farming rifts. You're going to get bored of it quickly because you get to click a skill every 10 seconds and then you can hop on your Firebats WD to actually have fun, but in lower torments until you build your gear up and get ancients / augmented. 
Honestly this is the best advice you can give someone. A lot of falls you have as a beginner hitting any feature can be attributed to a lack of proper speed. 
Sorry, 4 inches by 10 inches. I always mess that up.
I mean isn't this technically true?

Most polished game of 2016
Kind of confused by your comment. Are you saying most people on reddit support this law? Or that most people on reddit support abortion? I know the latter is true.
Higher grifts will have longer engagements and time for you to keep up and build charges. I have the same problem in lower grifts on my WD as my run speed is abysmal and i need to keep soul harvest stacks up as its 50% of my defense.

How prevalent are they nowadays?
The best way to counter this is to completely stay away from wherever they are setting up (which is usually a high traffic area with two entrances to a defendable position). Find a patrol area on the opposite side of the map that people will learn you are in, and come to revenge kill you. This draws enemies away and thus slows down their SPM and ability to get 30 before you. Also report them if you are certain they are actively colluding.
It's called Average Joe's Gym. We treat everyone as family here and we go against most of the "Globo-Gym" stereotypes that you'll see at big name gyms. That being said it's tough to keep the lights on in this place without using some of these unfair and shady practices like other gyms do. We're training to enter in this tournament in Vegas to win enough money to save the place.
Used to cook at Chili's. Somebody asked for "half-mashed, cold mashed potatoes."
He hit the nail on the head in his video saying that the reason they are ignoring him is because of money. This indie game that is going to get 50 views max is a drop in the bucket compared to AAA titles. They have done a cost analysis on games like these and if there is only X amount of profit to be made, you can only devote X amount of resources to support for this particular game. Should twitch spend hundreds of hours explaining, troubleshooting, advising, or helping someone who will bring in zero profit for the company? Why spend so much of your resources on something that admittedly breaks their already stated rules? Just to be a nice guy? This is a business, and this is a sunk cost for them. OP is well aware of this and I hope he gets a swift resolution, but I don't think this is likely.
I play quite a bit (700 paragon in about 3 weeks) and I feel like with the addition of getting gear to be competitive for end game ladders take 10 times longer a big turn off.  \n

Esoteric Alteration is a big damage reduction as well as adding a unity. You can also try putting your remaining points in vit instead of int. Other than that there's not much you can do other than try to keep soul harvest stacks up all the time and not get hit. Arach firebats is pretty glass cannon.
Not a single one?
I don't think 1 second of spawn protection would break this game.

I go back to subs of games I used to play that went in the wrong direction because I want to check to see if maybe there have been changes implemented that corrected whatever I didn't like. Some people just have to take it a step further for no good reason.

Okay, I can buy that if the ISPs are really giving out traffic information that shows people moving to newsgroups/streaming.
>This officer should be the one responsible for paying any legal fees\n\nI disagree.  That gives the brass the incentive to throw rookies under the bus any time something bad happens.\n\nI'd prefer the penalties come from the department so that next year, when they're underfunded and have to send officers home or they can't keep enough officers on the street to back each other up, they think about how they are all at risk when they make BS arrests.  \n\nAt least, it would be nice if it worked that way.
In texas, the store signs carry weight if they word them and sign them properly, which lots of stores are privy to.\n\nIn other states, especially states where no sign carries the weight of law, stores put up whatever.
If you're streaming it from a website, its unlikely it will ever be a problem for you because its unlikely that lawyers in the US will be able to tell you are watching it.\n\nIf you're using something like popcorn time, you're actually torrenting the video and watching it as it downloads.  Functionally equivalent to just plain torrenting.  That can land you in hot water, because your access can be traced by third parties.\n\nI know a bunch of people that have no idea what torrenting is and are not computer savvy, but have purchased android based boxes off of amazon or ebay to run kodi and stream from popcorn time.  They have no idea how it works, just that it works.

They tried to offer me a similar deal, telling me that even if I didn't watch cable, it would be cheaper per month to have it.\n\nI straight up asked the guy if I'd be able to cancel the TV portion in a year and go back to just internet, or if Comcast was going to act like it couldn't be done.\n\nHe said "honestly, they probably wont let you go back to just internet only after a year".\n\nThey know what they are doing.

Yeah, it sounds like the other guy just went all '28 days later' on him all of the sudden.

Where do the apple dongles come in?
Its really not ambiguous at this point.  The Supreme Court has ruled on this more than once - the militia is made up of all citizens in the US capable of bearing arms.  Its not the army, or the national guard, or something you have to sign up for.  Well regulated at the time meant well equipped.\n\nSee [Presser vs Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presser_v._Illinois) and also DC vs Heller to a lesser extent.\n\n"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the States, and in view of this prerogative of the general government, as well as of its general powers, the States cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government. "
Did you not read the headline?  Its UN-imaginable!  
Not sure I follow.  Shots were fired and people died before anyone carrying intervened.\n\nFollow up question - if the concealed carrier that intervened had been an off duty cop, but the outcome was EXACTLY the same, would you still say the concealed carrier did the wrong thing?  Or would it suddenly become the right thing to do?
> But think about all the people you know. The ones who aren't criminals, and probably wouldn't be carrying if they couldn't legally, but maybe don't have awesome judgment at times. The eighteen year olds, alcoholics, people with anger problems, people with butterfingers, people who are just stupid.\n\nYou could make that same argument for a lot of things that are potentially more dangerous - driving a car, drinking alcohol, using sharp scissors, driving a riding lawnmower, owning a swimming pool with kids, starting a fire....\n\nSure, some people I know should only be trusted with safety scissors, but just because they 'don't have the greatest judgement' and they haven't done anything illegal doesn't give me enough to take away rights or privileges.\n\nMost of those things you listed (with the exception of being 18) would  not exempt you from having a concealed carry permit anyway.\n\n
She just watched Kill Bill and this was the closest thing she could come up with on short notice.
Maybe.  Or they might have shot it out with the police in the parking lot and twice as many bystanders could have been hurt.\n\nIts one thing to say that the outcome wasn't ideal, but I don't think you can make the leap that 'no one would have been hurt'.  \n\nFurthermore, if we suddenly found out that the people that intervened were off-duty cops, nobody would be saying they 'shouldn't have done that, nobody was going to get hurt'.\n\n
That website has a higher chance of giving me cancer than the radiation its talking about.

Very cool concept.  I've been considering a DIY trailer and always assumed if I designed it, it would come out looking like trash.  Now I can just copy yours!  \n\nQuestion - about how heavy is the whole setup without the trailer/frame?  I already have a flatbed car trailer and am considering something I could lift with 2-4 people and place it on top of the flatbed and go camping, and store in the backyard the rest of the time.  I figure it would have to come in around 500lbs to make it work.\n\nWe just camped sebastian inlet park this weekend and starting to look at doing some more camping.

I think his comment was a bit of tongue in cheek saying the same thing you are.\n
I will admit I didn't read the article.  That said, the copyright lawyers involved in this could tell me the sky was blue and I wouldn't believe them.\n\nI'm somewhat suspicious of how they determine that things have moved to direct downloading since they can't track that, unless the newsgroups have started publishing download statistics.  Same thing with streaming.\n\nI highly doubt that if the answer was that all of the bittorrent traffic was coming from unenforceable VPNs that they would come out and say it.

> You mean the ban that only lasted 10 years and included a grandfather clause?\n\nWhy do you suppose it had a grandfather and sunset clause in it?

An idea was tested, it failed.  Compromise is not just "Ban half the guns" and then next year "Ban another half" and then a few years later "Ban another half" and each time calling it compromise.\n\nIf you don't compromise, you get nothing.

"If we impose harsher sanctions on Iran, russia may opt out of an agreement that we would like them to sign as a show of cooperation that we want to leverage against other countries in the region.

At the same time, usually.
I was not referencing the sample size.  My point is that you can't point to suicides that happen to be by firearm in the USA and call them 'violence' and then say the UK has zero of that, just because suicidal people in the UK have easier access to other methods.  Same thing when it comes to urban violence, or gang shootings, or whatever you want to call it. \n\nIf you had a sudden influx of immigrants from eastern europe, and they all had the means to bring guns with them, and started committing armed robberies in the UK, could we sit back and say "why doesn't the UK do something about its gun violence?  The UK has such poor gun culture!"\n\nThe vast majority (after suicides) of people that commit crimes with firearms have no regard for the law or the culture of the land, firearm law or otherwise.

Could be, although the people that intervened weren't armed.  Despite that, half the comments in here will be about how people with guns shouldn't act like the police...\n\nAlso, theres no saying the robbers wouldn't have started shooting if their exit was blocked (by police or otherwise), or if they needed to carjack someone to escape.
In other words, the vast majority of bittorrent traffic can now be traced to VPN services and there is nothing they can do about it.

Ad Hominem is using personal attacks to invalidate someone's position.(Such as saying that someone who smokes can't tell anyone else not to smoke because they do) What is currently happening is Thoorin has always said and done things that are intentionally inflammatory just to get a response. Players and viewers are saying that he goes too far and is past the point of professionalism.\n\nHere his actions are the topic of contention, not his position on the topic and as such saying he is a bully or that his actions go to far would not be a fallacy as it is the actual topic of discussion.
Turok just had this happen going into the B bombsite against Mouz. But I think they are using a rolled back version because of the sound, so maybe it just wasn't really fixed before?\n\nWhatever the reason is, it should be fixed as it has already affected a pro game at a significant LAN

An illiterate sex slave owning warlord is not the role model. To someone who has grown up in a region torn apart by war and conflict they are a symbol of power, someone who doesn't have to worry where their food is coming from, or if they are going to be killed. That is what they envy. \n\nBut you entirely disregarded the point of the first comment. If Islam is the entire reason that there is Ethnic cleansing going on why are Christian groups and regions participating in such widespread Ethnic cleansing?\n\nIn addition what would you like to happen? You condemn them for attacking Christians and other groups, but if you then want to persecute them for the same reasons, what makes that any more moral than what you have condemned?

I would also recommend changing some things about the car position as right now it feels like a cluttered 1 for 1 trade spot. Maybe get rid of the cars and add boxes or barrels and widen long just a bit so that that position can watch where the new door would be. Then if the T's want to molly that position they have to push far enough out that they would have to check pit for players. I would also raise the wall separating pit just a bit so that T's have to push forward a little bit further so the crossfire from car and pit is much more effective. That would make it riskier for the pit player to peek and riskier for the T's to clear pit and maybe make it less of a straight aim duel/ spawn race.

Casters and analysts going past the point of professionalism was the original topic. If a caster or analyst goes past the point of professional boundaries to belittle players most people would consider that to be bullying, and even if you don't want to use that term it means that they are still outside of what is acceptable in a professional environment.\n\nIn regards to the comment on Poland; people were upset because he compared a westernized country with significant infrastructure who have arguably the best team in the world to an area lacking in infrastructure that would not benefit from having it as people in that area would not be able to go and it would be difficult for others to travel there.\n\nIf you would like more examples of Thoorin attacking players outside of analyzing a game or going too far I would direct you to his twitter.\n\nThe order of importance for issues such as tournament conditions, or player rights depends on the individual, I personally would defer to the players, as they experience all of these issues and would be in the best position to determine in what order these issues need to be addressed.
If you are playing competitive you can talk to your teammates after you die. If you are are wanting someone to join your game to spectate the other team and tell you their positions that's ghosting, and cheating.
Yeah, all I could find were printers, just that link to the special switches for their keyboards though
He's a support player, and in the last 3 months he's had a higher rating than Seized, Edward, and RPK as well as the same rating as pasha and .01 lower than Taco. He's not flashy but he does his job and does it well. He isn't a star that the team is built around but a solid dependable support player that puts teammates into more favorable situations.\nHe may have had a few bad games in the last month but overall he is generally consistent. 
The games are delayed until tommorow? Where did you find that?
Maybe give the player being shot some sort of visible outline? That way you can keep the dark fog but the viewer can still see the frag
My sister has gluten sensitivity (non-celiac) and she had no ill effects from a batch of amber I brewed using clarity ferm. \n\nIt's cheap, dead simple (just dump it in with your yeast at pitching time) and I didn't notice any off flavors or other negative effects on the beer at all.
I'm far from obsessive about keeping it out, but do you just dump EVERYTHING in? \n\nI usually run the wort through a large strainer, which by the bottom of the kettle ends up being dumping trub into the strainer and letting the liquid drip through, then pitching the brown/green sludge onto my lawn.
So..here's my experience with a kit that looked pretty much like that one:\n\nBack in college, I got this type of kit. I followed the directions as written, did everything I was supposed to and when it was done I had beer...technically. It was alcoholic. It contained all of the necessary elements (water, hops, malt). But damn, it was nasty. Even as a broke college student who desperately wanted to believe that the several weeks this had taken were not a waste...it was undrinkable. After forcing myself to choke down a few pints...down the sink it went. \n\nNow in all fairness, I knew NOTHING about brewing at the time. But if you're looking for a beginner kit, I'd highly recommend getting an actual homebrew starter kit online or at your LHBS instead of spending money on this. At the very least, the buckets, hydrometer, etc. you'll get with that will still be usable should you decide you like the hobby.
Yep, exactly this. I usually switch over to an s-shaped airlock before cold crashing so the air can bubble back through. Forgot to this time.
Must confess: While nowhere near this level of ineptitude, I did repeatedly fuck up driving a moped I rented in Key West once. \n\nBoth turn signals were by the right hand grip, but the kill switch (pretty much an identical button) was by the left hand grip. For a while, I couldn't figure out why the engine kept sputtering or cutting off every time I turned left. 
Go Noles!
How do you get past the time issue though? Even if you "make" wort with the thing, you'd still have to let it ferment into beer.\n\nUnless they're thinking of doing the whole dehydrated alcohol thing, which is even weirder.\n\nPlus, if you want Budweiser or Corona...why the hell wouldn't you just buy them already made? I can't imagine you'd save any money. they're already dirt cheap.
Hey, you watch your language!\n\nDon't make me follow you into a restaurant, push your friend away, punch you in the face, walk out calmly, suppress the video for 18 months and then release it the morning it was about to be released anyway and claim I'm glad to finally share it.\n
For everyone who's stirring their wort vigorously or moving the chiller around a ton, how do you deal with the trub all getting stirred up again?\n\nOne of the things I like about leaving the chiller still is that I can rack out most of the wort pretty clearly until I get to the funky stuff at the bottom. \n\nOf course, one of the things I hate about leaving it still is that cooling it takes longer than I'd like...so looking for a happy medium.
That Ginsu knife went right through my finger when I missed that carrot and chopped my knuckle instead. Why do they have to make a knife so sharp?

This includes the swivel nuts if you're using them. Hand-tightened one and never realized it was leaking until I tried to pour a beer a couple days later and nothing came out. Opened the kegerator to find the gauge on zero. Lost about 3/4 of a tank of CO2.
Well...crap.

4 pin locks for $100 is great. \n\nI got them at $35 each a while back and thought that was a great deal. IME, AIH used kegs are decently beaten up and pretty dirty outside & sticky inside, but I've had no structural problems and wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
Because Stan Lee INSISTS on a cameo.
I'm not really sure what the point of comparing brewing yeast to baking yeast is. Unless you want to brew with baking yeast, it's not a viable option.\n\nThe point was more that even at $4 a packet, if the required DME costs $1 is it really worth $3 in savings to measure, boil, cool, sterilize container & stir bar, and spin the mixture for a day or two vs. just tossing in another packet of yeast?
Kill it. Eat it. Thank the lord for it. 
Wait, what? It's perfectly ok to add 2-3 cups of iodine sanitizer to a batch of beer?\nI assumed that drinking that much iodine would be a bad idea and would definitely mess up the taste of the beer. Is that wrong?\nIf so, I'm doubly sad.\n
BOOM!
See if your lhbs carries insulin then. :-)
What do you mean that the gravity reading was "1.035 up from the 1.011?" When did you take each reading?

You da real MVP. 
I completely agree that Blood Meridian was more challenging, but I would have been ok with that if there had been any kind of payoff. There wasn't. \n\nIt was just a long, slow drudge through one awful scenario after another. I didn't care a bit about any of the characters. I couldn't discern any particular point to the plot. I just wanted it to end, and when it did all I felt was relief that I could move on and read something else. \n\nI have enormous respect for McCarthy's skills as a writer, and the language used to depict many of the scenes in the book was beautifully chosen, but the whole thing felt like a test the author was putting himself and his readers through. I passed, I suppose, but I'm glad the course is over. 
I did add a bit more up front as suggested in the recipe (basically used the hops that would have been left over from what I ordered- I have the specific #s at home) and I had to use Tettnang instead of Opal since I couldn't find Opal anywhere without placing an unnecessarily expensive separate order.
They should ask Trump about this so he can tell them more about his impressive Electoral Collage victory.
So for the price of a Grainfather, you can brew 13 beers at a time instead of 45-50. Whoo hoo!
This looks identical to the one I first used, though I bought mine at Bass Pro Shops on sale for $40.\n\nThe kettle is pretty flimsy, but I still use mine to heat strike/sparge water. The burner stand is sturdy, and it has no problem keeping a 5-gallon batch at boil.\n\nOnly downsides are that it's a bit loud and it has the stupid timer on it that you need to clamp a vice grip on to keep it from spinning and kicking the flame off when it times out.
Seconding the keg. Get that now and buy yourself a kettle later. 
Is that what Director Fury told you? 
I'd MUCH rather have someone tell me they don't like the beer, what they think is wrong with it, how they wish it was different, etc. than to just say, "Yeah, it's ok" and leave it at that.\n\nYou don't learn anything if you don't get feedback. And if the feedback is coming from a friend who normally drinks Mich Ultra...I can just filter that out myself. (Like they filter all of the flavor out of Ultra.) :-)
I used [this](https://beerandbrewing.com/VP3vXywAACoAebzq/article/funkwerks-tropic-king-recipe), which was published in Beer & Brewing and is supposed to be the real recipe, scaled down for homebrewing.\n\nThe sample last night was pretty damn tasty, and that was before the dry hop. Can't wait to sample this one cold & carbonated.
Loved The Road and I have a huge amount of respect for Mccarthy as a writer, but I just finished this book last night and can't say I liked it much.\n\nThe lack of punctuation, which is part of his style in this one, made discerning narration from dialog a bear. The plot was virtually non-existent. The endless stream of misery was necessary for the concept, but brutal to slog through. And the ending, while appropriate and skillfully crafted, wasn't enough to justify all the work to get there IMO.\n\nObviously, everyone has different opinions, but I'd have a hard time recommending this one.
How am I supposed to know you're reveling in your win over...Iowa?\n\nYet another sign your program is decidedly not in good shape. \n\nBut hell, enjoy. 
Maybe a dumb question, but does her lab use pro quality refractometers? 
Your defense was absolutely exceptional at times this season, and you absolutely have been cranking out NFL players. But a lot of what made that defense exceptional is headed to the NFL now, some of them leaving early, your DC just left and you haven't been recruiting at the same level since Muschamp left. I think you're overly optimistic to think it's plug and play, but we'll see. \n\nPair that with an offense that's Calloway (who I think is underrated, even though he's already highly thought of), Scarlett and a whole lot of question marks and I don't see you beating Michigan to start the year. \n\nAs for FSU fans, of course we're going to talk smack when we've owned you for 4 years straight and Miami for 7. That "yeah, well you can't win your division" argument is garbage when the team that did win our division has been in the NC game both of those seasons. Put UF in our division and you're 3rd at best those years, so give that a rest. \n\n
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuddddddddddggggggggeeeeeeee!\n
It's been 54 minutes now. Do I win something?
Nobody tell r/TheDonald about this. 
Is Moon Cricket a thing? I'm trying really hard to even figure out what group that could be intended to disparage. 
I may not have been totally clear. \n\n I was never considering adding more water and doing an additional sparge. I'm just talking about allowing the liquid already in there to continue working it's way through the grains to the ball valve in my cooler so I can drain it out, then adding that to the kettle. \n\nYou're right, it's not a ton of wort (a few pints seems about accurate). 
I diluted it according to instructions, which I believe is 1/2 oz in 2.5 gallons of water (not at home right now, so I can't check the bottle for sure, but I used the built-in measuring chamber).\n\nThe solution, which I've always used for sanitizing, definitely has a fairly strong smell to it. It's a no-rinse sanitizer, so there's always a BIT of it in the beer after you empty out the carboy before filling, drain bottles before filling, sanitize tubing, etc... but 2-3 cups of it seemed like an awful lot to mess around with.
Yet another time I really wish I liked scotch/whiskey/bourbon.\n\nTried it many times and...I just don't.
Tallahassee, Florida. There's only one LHBS here, called Homebrew Den, and the people there are great. I end up ordering a lot of stuff online because the prices and variety are often better, but still shop there when it makes sense. \n\nI usually listen to the silence of my garage or driveway since the smell of the beer keeps the kids away. :-)
Lol, ok then. \n\nIt's GREAT to be a Florida Gator!!!\n\nBetter now?
Tasty beer, but I can't imagine wanting 5 gallons of it. I could barely get through an entire bomber without feeling like I'd just given myself diabetes. 
That's pretty high. Where are you? 
Use bigger bottles. Lagunitas Sucks sells in beautiful 32 oz bottles, and plenty of beers come in 22oz size.\n\nFewer to fill means less time. Besides, when's the last time you drank just one 12 oz brew? 
It wasn't the taste I was worried about. I honestly thought that it was a bad idea to drink that much sanitizer. Didn't want anyone getting sick, even if it tasted ok.\n\nYou're right about me researching before dumping again though. Lesson learned, and at least I have an excuse to brew another batch, right?
Never worked there, but this has been 100% my experience as a Starbucks customer. \n\nI order "a grande coffee with skim milk and splenda" pretty much every time I'm there. It's < $3 and it's hot and strong. Done.\n\nIf it's hot out, I'll get an iced coffee or, occasionally, a Frappuccino. Still < $3.50 - $4.\n\nNever had anyone laugh at me for calling it a "large" even when I did. Never felt pressured to buy some Venti whipped pumpkin spiced nutmeg laden thing with 6" of whipped cream on top. It's just a place to get coffee and use WiFi and eat lemon pound cake for breakfast.\n\nI don't get the hate.\n
Beating your rival 31-13 is right up there. :-)\n\nHad to do it.\n\nGo Noles!
He's going to need to beef up considerably to play FB, but maybe that's the plan in a year or two. Don't see him cracking the RB rotation though with Patrick, Rasul, Green, Akers, Laborn & White on board.
How long do you usually ferment? \n\nThis was started two weeks ago this evening at 65°F and then ramped up to 75°F over 48 hours per recipe instructions. It's been at that temp ever since.
I did this, but found that the pot that came with my turkey fryer was just too thin and flimsy for me to trust it. Bought a 10-gallon aluminum kettle for $40 from Staples (yep, the office supply store- free shipping too) that's much thicker and sturdier, but still use the original pot to heat sparge water. 
For the last 8 years you've had Muschamp and/or his recruits. Now, you don't. And if it takes a few games to gel, you'll likely lose to Michigan, which was my whole damn point when I started commenting in this thread. \n\nOur success won't last forever, but I'm sure as hell going to enjoy it while it does. 
Exactly what I came here to post. Looks like he's free, then a Transformer's scorpion tail gets him.
Loved Ender's Game, and I liked Ender's Shadow far more than I expected. I thought it would be a gimmicky attempt to string out the Ender's Game story, but instead I think it greatly enhanced it and built out another truly extraordinary chracter in Bean as well.
TIL: Some people don't call it "nuking" their food.
There's a very small town in S Georgia that I drive through fairly often on the way from FL to Atlanta. Along the main/only road through this town is an aluminum canopy typically meant to park a car under, and over the last couple of years I've watched as someone slowly and sloppily bricked in the open ends, and the front now has a door as well. I'm pretty sure someone lives there, even though there's no way it's up to any kind of code at all. \n\n
Day 7 update: It definitely started slowing down yesterday, but it's still bubbling through the blow off rhythmically a week after pitching.
Yo dog, I heard you like mouths...
What about the offense? Even with all the injuries on D, that was the side of the ball you guys needed the most help on. 
Unless you're feeding them to draw them closer. Because venison sausage goes GREAT with beer. :-)
Ah, the transitive property!\n\nSo, Louisville beat us by 43. We beat you by 18. So Louisville would beat you by...61!\n\n
For states with a "Stand Your Ground" version of the law, you don't have to even have the gun pointed at you first.\n\nAs long as you FEEL that there's an imminent threat to your life, you're clear to shoot first. 
I mean, where do you keep YOUR grenades? 
Probably? 
It was IO Star, and probably a good 2-3 cups of it. Not worth the risk IMO. 
To each his own. That just seems like a ton of work to save $4.40 a batch, max.
I was just using your math. ($44 savings / 10 batches)\n\nNot interested in arguing with you. Do what you like.
That is much preferable to going to JJ. 
Not really. They eat a lot of insects, but unless mosquitoes are the only game in town they tend to choose other more substantial insects like moths, beetles, etc. \n\nhttp://www.mosquito.org/faq
Particularly when that side of the ball was responsible for propping up the other. 
If he's miserably hot now, he's going to die by mid-May.
Might be true, but I've read both and loved The Road but didn't like Blood Meridian at all. 
Maybe Lane's going pro and Cook isn't. \n\nThere's a chance, right? Right? RIGHT? 
They should be. But the comment I was responding to was from a Michigan fan worrying about playing UF to start next season. Thumping Iowa does not equal beating Michigan. \n\n
Thought I'd do a quick check and...yep, Republican.
Fuck yeaux guys.\n\nSigned,\n\n 2,000 Chickens
Only one piece of advice, eh?\n\nGo all-grain. I know a lot of people say you can make great beer from extract and I'm 100% sure that's true. I'm also 100% sure that I've been happier with every one of my all-grain brews than any of my extract ones.
Ok Mangino, whatever.
Much appreciated.
You could go the Grainfather route if you're only planning on 5-gallon batches. [Here's](http://www.homebrewfinds.com/2016/12/free-refurbished-keg-with-grainfather-purchase-3.html) a deal that includes a free keg with one. \n\nYou'd still want a ferm chamber and keezer + CO2 tank/regulator/tap though.
I like to think they're just really polite and it's more of a, "Whoops!" (Probably followed by an inaudible, "My bad.")\n\n
The look on Bilema's face while his team choked away yet another game was great. He's now 1 game under .500 in his Arkansas career. \n\nI hate that guy. 
As an FSU fan who just watched us play UF and then Michigan back to back...don't be nervous. \n\nYou're losing a lot, but so is UF and your program is in far better shape. \n\nUF's offense is historically bad, and their D is losing quality at every level. By the end of the year, they may have figured some things out, but you're playing them early and I just don't think they'll be able to score enough to keep it competitive. 
I used to do it before I had a ferm chamber. Seemed like it helped to slightly clear the beer and reduce the amount of sediment that ended up in my bottles. \n\nNow I could crash and keg, so no more secondary. 
It looks like its going to be a pretty big event. Last year they had just over 500 jeeps and they are expecting more than 1200 this year.
You're being downvoted to oblivion, but I'm with you. I had a burger for lunch and don't feel the slightest bit of emotion for that delicious cow.
Friend and I thought it would be funny to sneak into the back bumper of the ice cream truck in my neighborhood while another guy distracted the driver. \n\nWorked until we realized the truck was leaving our neighborhood. I hopped off, bracing to land forward since that's the direction I was jumping, and as soon as my feet hit the pavement, the back of my head did too. \n\nLuckily all I got was a knot on the back of my head and a slight scalp abrasion. Could have been much worse. 
And the cold crash. So. Damn. Clear.\n\nSorry NEIPAs.
Caribou!
And the kid, right? \n\nThat kid obviously loves Rhino Lightning and it's not his fault the parents made shit decisions about buying it and training it and are now forcing him to abandon it. 
This is where I pass on info I got from this sub that helped greatly:\n\nPut your bottles on the open dishwasher door. Beer dribbles, pools up and when you're done you just...shut the door. One of the best/simplest tips I ever got for bottling.
I long for the day we can brew in the vacuum of space. Plus, think how fast chilling the wort will be at absolute zero.
Peace be with you, my brother to the North. 
The MVP of what game? The one you lost 31-13, even with your LBs playing "out of their minds?" You're picking an MVP for that?\n\nDo you honestly think your program is in good shape? \n\n
Man, that's a new one to me. Thanks for the education. \n\nAt my job we had a guy from Pakistan come work for us and my/our boss started calling him "Paki-man" just as a play on Pacman/Pokémon because he thought it was funny. A week or so later, the guy tells another co-worker that he doesn't want to ruffle any feathers because he knows it's not intentional, but that calling a Pakistani a "Paki" is really derogatory. Like, the equivalent of the N word. \n\nWe told our boss, who had no idea, nobody ever called him that again and it just quietly went away. 
Extract is fine to start off with, particularly if you have no experience at all. Most homebrewers start with extract, and some choose to stick with it. I started with it, but have since gone to AG and wouldn't go back, but to each his own.\n\nThe type of kit I mean is something like [this](http://www.northernbrewer.com/brew-share-enjoy-homebrew-starter-kit?gclid=COyS0ffNn9ICFVMlgQodOpoKhw)\n\nIt doesn't have to be that exact kit (you can shop around, or build your own if you already have any of the elements, like a pot) but it should have similar items included.\n\n
Spruce tips? They'd add a bit of Christmas tree vibe and the piney/resinous taste is still in line with the IPA style. \n\nMaybe pick a few fruits commonly found in fruitcake and make a "fruitcake IPA," with cherries, dates, pears, etc added to secondary?
My sarcasm was directed at the OC, not you. And I agree. Who gives a shit if I buy a rubicon and put 20" rims on rubber band tires and never wheel it? You will want to buy it in 15 years since you know it wasn't ever beat on, right? So for that fact alone, I'm glad there are plenty of pavement princesses on the road now. Also, if every JKU wheeled, trails would be shut down in no time. Half of the places we wheel, we aren't given a hard time because we don't trash the land (and often clean it up). \n\nAnd completely agree on the lockers before light bars thing. They are a hell of a lot cheaper. With that said, I just removed my lightbar on Saturday and will never put another one on again. \n\nI'm defending the right to make these choices, but I dont necessarily *like* what every owner does with their shit. 
> Terrorism fails to overthrow a country of the potential of the US.\n\nAny evidence to support this?\n\nMy evidence against your claim is the fact that we are not any more closer to controlling Afghanistan today as we were 16 years ago. We are trillions in debt because of it. The definition of attrition warfare is wearing down your enemies resources (because you can't win a direct engagement due to their overwhelming fire superiority). \n\n>You're defending it with the Revolutionary war, which at the very premise of this argument was disqualified because AGAIN, technology has moved on.\n\nI spent 9 years in the Marine Corps and fought in the First Battle of Fallujah in 2004 and patrolled Fallujah and the farmlands to the south of the city in 2005-2006. Yes, we have technology that gives us the advantage in a direct engagement. You don't really understand attrition warfare. The tactic is to make your opponent deplete their resources. A large military is expensive to maintain. You maintain a small threat and attack and then quickly retreat. The large military dedicates a lot of men to respond to a small element. Multiply this across the entire battlefield spanning years and the large opponent will have to withdraw. \n\n>Even more on the point, Afghan "fighters" have hardly succeeded at what you state is their goal, have they?\n\nI will refer you to my statement above in that we are no closer to controlling Afghanistan today as we were 16 years ago and we are in significant debt in trying to do so. So yeah, I would say they lose more battles but they are winning the war.\n\n>The same taking place in America, where the country would invest full resources, would make the goal even less possible.\n\nNegative ghostrider. You should take a look at the oath military service members take (as did I). We swear to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. My personal experience leads me to believe that service members would not support a tyrannical government in the capacity you suggest. \n\nYou think I dont understand this debate? I have a BA in Political Science. I have studied failed states, tyrannical governments and laws. I have provided actual reasoning behind my claims, yet you provide only assertions. [As Walter would say....](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/df/df3612486fb50970411774f991b6baec9fb7cca2e144180b885f03fba7b07217.jpg)
I didn't have a problem with the AK when I was in Iraq. When they were shooting at us 600m away in an open field, it was great. We could rest easy knowing that they weren't hitting us and everything from the M16a4s to the m2/Mk-19s, and 203s could reach out and touch them just fine.
What camera are you using? How is this actually done? This is really cool! Great job, OP.
Yes, it is. \n\n>A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State\n\nThat's exactly what that means. Still don't believe that is the reasoning? Read the Federalist Papers No 46 by James Madison. Would you take *his* words to heart since he wrote the Bill of Rights? 
Omg I wanna snug him.
Wouldn't an insecure person be looking for SecuriTea? 
I was joking to a degree. \n\nI'm happy OP shared this, but this really isn't DIY when it requires this much technical knowledge and professional equipment. \n\nMaybe better suited for /r/IMadeThis than DIY. Again, I was joking when I commented and am glad OP shared his ~~torture chamber~~ underground party bunker.
Hey, that's me!!!
Honestly, the hate is really only in this sub. I mean, everyone has their personal preference but IRL, no one in Jeep clubs bash personal build choices like the keyboard warriors around here. 
Man, you make me feel like a wus. Its been in the upper 60s and low 70's and I ride with my windows up. Florida life has spoiled me. 
The CELs will clear on the JKs if certain issues have been resolved. A CEL for a loose gas cap is one that will self clear after driving a bit. It's happened to me a couple of times.

Zero fucks given for the haters. I build my jeep for me! I wasnt even looking for an exhaust. The guy had it listed for 300 and I texted him saying Ill give you 150. A week later he text me back okay come get it. I wouldnt pay the $400 they are listed for though.
You know what is stupid? Thinking your ideas are the best and everyone else is wrong. Like /u/wut3va said, if your ideas truly are the best, why don't you amend the Constitution? \n\nJump on board with all of the other anti-2Aers, write an amendment and have it ratified. \n\nIt wont happen because it is an ignorant, silly, shortsighted idea that aims to fix a non-existent problem and takes absolutely no recorded history into account for its justification.

I didn't edit my original post because the differentiation is not really integral to the point. It's more pedantic. Thank you though.

It was great. Saturday closing for lunch was silly but other than that, I thought things moved along well for the number of Jeeps there. \n\nNext year I will plan to camp so I have two days of wheeling. \n\nIt would also be nice to not have to be escorted on the trails but I guess that's how they keep people from messing up the land.  
Yeah and that has about as much reasoning and logic as the 5 second rule or saying "no homo" before performing fellatio on another man. Doesn't really change the reality in any of these scenarios, does it? 
> And if it gets baked on by a few hot months good luck getting it off without WD40 and a pressure washer.\n\nCompletely agree. Took a 3500 PSI pressure washer to get it off my mazda wheels. \n\nThe other option would be to use HVT wheel Paint. Worked well for me on my stock wheels before I bought new ones.
I was waiting for their head to get caught on a beam.
> you shouldn't drive quickly over suspect bridges.\n\nI think that really is the point we should take away from all of this. \n\nIf it's suspect, don't drive over it.
Try the nicotine lozenges. They helped me kick my dipping habit. Any time I feel like I am going to slip, I get the lozenges again, use them for a week and then drop them. They are much easier to quit that actual tobacco. 
Yes I agree with that, but that is how the 2nd Amendment was written and intended, like it or not. Our founding fathers express their intent in the Federalist Papers.\n\nA well-regulated militia means just that. A well equipped civilian population. 
Look no need to name call. I never called you a name. \n\nPersonally, I dont think citizens should own RPGs and alike. I am simply stating that the Constitution does not permit the regulation of arms. 
I don't think it looks bad. Kinda like a Tacoma. 
'Cept with boobs.
It really was a lot of fun. They made a mistake of closing the trails for lunch on Saturday and they made changes for Sunday. I heard there were a lot fewer Jeeps on Sunday. Next year, I will be camping there overnight so I get two days to wheel. \n\n10/10 would recommend! 
>Seems like a gotcha.\n\nUnless it is publicly funded. If I could go train at the police department range, it wouldn't be much of an infringement. More like a perk.\n\nMan, you come off like a 19 year old polisci freshman with just enough information to chime in on an adult discussion without offering anything meaningful. Still waiting on your response from our thread but I suspect you have tucked tail and won't address what I said because you are out of your element so you choose easy comments to pick at.
Man, I would love to live in a place like that.
It happens *way* more often than you think. It's easy to get complacent/busy/distracted. 
I had the same problem. I used back to black plastic polish and it cleaned it up. 
I did say TSA so you are right. But individual airlines have specific rules as well.\n\n[Spirit Airline's policy](https://www.spirit.com/content/documents/en-us/Special_items.pdf):\n"Ammunition must be packed in the original\nmanufacturing package or metal/wood box, with a maximum of 11\npounds per customer. "\n\nI just remembered the rule from when I flew.
>My assertion is that using "overthrowing the US" as a reason to support is invalid.\n\nExcept it is actually written IN the Second Amendment. That is the fundamental reasoning for the 2nd Amendment. \n\nIs your position that it would be a futile attempt to fight the US Federal government and this is why the 2nd Amendment doesn't matter anymore? I don't want to correct every little detail and inaccuracy. What is it that you are stating?
I thought that is what you meant when you said it was ambiguous, which is why I asked.\n\nIf we substitute some words, you can see the meaning pretty clearly:\n\n"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."\n\n"A well balanced breakfast being necessary to the start of a healthy day, the right of the people to keep and eat food shall not be infringed."\n\nWho in the above sentence has the right to keep and eat food? A well balanced breakfast, or the people?\n\n"Well stocked libraries being necessary to the development of a sound mind, the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed."\n\nWhat is the library comprised of?\n\nOne more that applies a bit more directly:\n\n"The liberty of the press being essential to the security of freedom in a state, any person may publish his sentiments on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty."\n\nWho in the above may publish their sentiments on any subject, the press or 'any person'?\n\nThe part about a well regulated Militia can be completely ignored. It is just a preface to the Constitutional Right. \n\nI sincerely hope this has helped. 
*Pounds* with a "P". Sorry, sometimes I mumble.
Thanks for the LPT. I'm from Florida so I would prob be that second guy if I were ever in this situation. It would be really embarrasing since I laugh pretty hard whenever someone gets hurt in a non-life/limb threatening way. So I would have eaten crow pretty quickly.
I know they said lockers were required for Twin Rock and Hog Root. Did you really need them or could a skilled driver with 35s make it?\n\nI ended up not going on them because I didn't want to be the shmuck to hold everyone up because they didn't have the required equipment. 
You haven't been to Flint Michigan lately, have you?
From the Federalist Papers No. 46 written by James Madison:\n\n"Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. **To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence**. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides **the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition**, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the **governments are afraid to trust the people with arms**. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, **it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it**."\n\nEmphasis is mine of course. \n\nIf you do not study history, you are doomed to repeat it. Our founding fathers gave us explanations of their intent. The Second Amendment, just like the rest of the Bill of Rights aren't rights that are *granted*. They are immutable, inalienable INDIVIDUAL God given rights of any free man.\n\n"governments are afraid to trust the people with arms"\n\nYou should be afraid of a government that doesn't trust the people with arms.\n\nYour phrasing suggests that it would be ridiculous for someone to believe that they should have the right to own a weapon such as one that a standing army would carry. The words of the Constitution as well as the words of our founding fathers suggest that it is your opinion that is the ridiculous one.

Arms was not restricted or limited. Well regulated means well equipped in good functioning order. They explicitly meant citizens should own military grade weapons. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5vgmi2/assault_weapons_are_not_protected_by_the_second/de2kxs1/?st=izh7afgx&sh=76f8660d) is a link to the 2A broken down.\n\n>None the less I would love to know how an AR-15 is going to protect you against a government that has hell fire missiles in a drone above you right now.\n\nIts called attrition warfare. Look at Afghanistan. We do not control that country any more than we did 16 years ago and we are trillions of dollars in debt. We win battles but they are going to win the war.\n\nAnother example is Vietnam. \n\nAlso, you assume that military service members will ignore the oath they took to follow orders of a tyrannical government.
Awesome! What do you have for a front axle? If its the D30, what reinforcement do you have?\n\nI just went to 35s and thought about skipping right to 37s, but trusses, gussets, sleeves, chromoly shafts, gears, ball joints, tire carrier, wheels and tires was too much to swallow all at once.
Queston Posed:\n\nDoes the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights address a collective right (standing military unit) or an individual right (citizen)?\n\nThe Bill of Rights are all individual rights; none of which address a collective right such as a right of a unit of people, corporation or government. So if you have a hard time understanding the sentence structure, knowing that everything in the Bill of Rights are individual liberties and through the transitive property, you can infer that it was not Madison's intent to address a collective right and the only possibility would be that he was codifying your inalienable right to bear arms.
I thought the TSA said ammo had to be in the original box in a locked case. 
I said that those weapons are included as permissible, however I don't really believe that a private citizen should be able to. I understand the law but don't agree with it entirely. \n\n>You said weapons equivalent to the government. You said arming yourself to resist the government. The government has those weapons..\n\nTyrannical government, not just a government you don't agree with. A government that goes against the will of the people. A government that individual actors have usurped power for their own benefit. Like the idiot Stephen Miller who was claiming that the Presidents actions should not be questioned by the Supreme Court. \n\nThe ruling in which we are talking about is extending beyond weapons of our military. Our military do not use an AR-15 which is semi-automatic. They use select fire and fully automatic weapons. \n\nSo even if I agree that citizens shouldn't have the weapons of a military, this ruling is beyond that. They are restricting citizens from owning weapons inferior to the weapons of our military.
I just copy and pasted where I spelled it out for another redditor. Sorry if it came off condescending as it was not my intent. \n\nThe sentence structure is a bit different than what we are used to today but it does pass muster. \n\nIt starts with the justification of why the right is necessary and then codifies the individual right.\n\nI've seen the 2A reworded like this:\n\n"A well balanced breakfast being necessary to the start of a healthy day, the right of the people to keep and eat food shall not be infringed."\n\n

And I really dont take issue with prohibiting nuclear weapons in the hands of citizens (even though it is laughable to even suggest this could be a possibility; entire nations cannot come up with a functioning nuclear device, much less a single private citizen).\n\nThis thread is about a rifle that is no different from a common hunting rifle being banned. It is a complete over reach. 
Yeah, its just an axle back. I got it for $150 off Craigslist and it sounds pretty decent tbh. 
Vibrating luggage will set off flags too and then they have to call the police. 9/10 times it's an electric razor, but every once in a while it's a dildo.

No, you need to read the Federalist Papers. A militia, even by today's standard would include any able bodied, willing to fight person. Nothing to do with a standing military at all. \n\nA militia: generally is an army or other fighting unit that is composed of **non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation** or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically,\n\nWell regulated means well outfitted aka armed with military equivalent weapons.

This would be cool to get hydro-dipped. 
You think so? What other Right in the Bill of Rights was a collective right and not an individual right?\n\nThis is actually a problem stemming from our educational system.\n\nIf we substitute some words, you can see the meaning pretty clearly:\n\n"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."\n\n"A well balanced breakfast being necessary to the start of a healthy day, the right of the people to keep and eat food shall not be infringed."\n\nWho in the above sentence has the right to keep and eat food? A well balanced breakfast, or the people?\n\n"Well stocked libraries being necessary to the development of a sound mind, the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed."\n\nWhat is the library comprised of?\n\nOne more that applies a bit more directly:\n\n"The liberty of the press being essential to the security of freedom in a state, any person may publish his sentiments on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty."\n\nWho in the above may publish their sentiments on any subject, the press or 'any person'?

Thank you for the report. I haven't seen this before and I have a K&N filter exactly because I was told it was the best for my Jeep.\n\nI do have a question though. The statement "plugs up 3x faster but passes more dirt/captures less dirt" is self conflicting. \n\nThe filter has but only two options: pass dust/dirt through or filter it, right? Plugging up a filter just means reaching its maximum capacity. So either it plugs up faster because it is capturing more dirt/dust or it would last longer because its capturing less. \n\nI'm not arguing one way or another. I just want real information so that I can make the best choice. 
Okay, can you point out any other Amendment that is a collective right and not an individual right?\n\nThe Bill of Rights are all individual rights by definition. \n\nThe first 10 amendments to the Constitution make up the Bill of Rights. Written by James Madison in response to calls from several states for greater constitutional protection for *individual liberties*, the Bill of Rights lists specific prohibitions on governmental power.
600m is far for m16s too but at 800m, it's effective for group targets. The specific patrol I was talking about, a Huey and Cobra were shooting rockets and guns on target too. \n\nWe were engaging a 25mm AA gun and a squad sized element. 
It's just outside of Tampa. Man, it was a lot of fun. I'll definitely be there again next year. 
Eh, I read and interpreted the Federalist Papers No 46 a bit differently. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._46\n\n"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation"\n\nHe specifically refers to the People separately than the militia. How does that not suggest that they are separate and not one in the same?  
What? It is very clear. Read the Madison's essay the Federalist Papers no 46 if you want more of a narrative of Madison's intent as he wrote the Bill of Rights.\n\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n>A well regulated \n\nThe phrase "well-regulated" was in common use long before 1789.

Do you see how you actually haven't supported any of your arguments beyond your assertion that it is the correct viewpoint?\n\n>Right. That will overthrow the most powerful country in the world from within it's own borders. With rifles.\n\nThe Vietnam War. You may not have heard of it given the way you position so many of your arguments. Some farmers in the woods successfully repelled the most powerful military in the world. Afghanistan. Same as Vietnam. The one thing those two have in common is that those fighting against the US were nationalist fighting against an invading force. \n\nYou have at least 2 service members in this thread that have stated that they wouldn't follow a tyrannical government's orders. The oath of enlistment that each service member takes prohibits them from following a tyrannical governments orders. They would literally be fighting their own blood; it wont ever happen in the way that you think. That punches a HUGE hole in your assertions that attrition warfare couldn't be successful in a civil war of the people fighting a tyrannical government. They wouldn't have the bodies to fight the war. \n\nThere could be a smaller portion of fighters that ally with the federal government, but it certainly would not be the majority of the service members. \n\nThen you go on to assert a truth, that the right to bear arms has already been infringed. What bearing does this have? We have had bad interpretations or flat out wrong laws on the books before. It didn't stop African Americans from fighting for what is right. \n\nAnyone that believes in the democratic society we have here in the US would value the right to bear arms. Without a way to ensure you are able to exercise your rights, they are in jeopardy of being taken away.   
You make me thirsty for ORM!
Oh they do quite a bit, however, it's usually less than flattering... 
Nice strawman argument there. So you think a semi-automatic AR-15 is comparable to those weapon systems? What branch of the military did you serve your country in?\n\nSuggesting that a private citizen could ever even afford a nuclear weapon is so far beyond absurd, its not even laughable. I usually refrain from calling an idea stupid, but this qualifies. \n\nPersonally, I dont really think that we *should* be able to own those types of weapon systems, but as the Bill of Rights reads, they aren't precluded. \n\nLet's just back up and focus on what the thread is about. It's about a State restricting the use of a semi-automatic rifle that has no additional functionality of a common hunting rifle. In fact, because an AR-15 uses an intermediate cartridge, they are *less* powerful than a hunting caliber round (again, by definition).\n\nThe Right to bear arms is to protect the people from a tyrannical government. Even if we ban private ownership of RPGs and .50 cal machine guns, it doesn't mean all is lost. We have been fighting in Afghanistan for 1.5 decades now and it has cost the US taxpayers trillions of dollars. They don't have access to MK-19s, F-16s, Howitzers etc yet we are no closer to conquering those lands than we were 16 years ago. It's called attrition warfare and it is a proven military strategy and our founding fathers ensured we will have the tools we need in the event of an ambitious government. \n\nYou really ought to read the Federalist Papers.
You aren't going to change minds by saying "look it up".

Craigslist. Found them in my area for $100.
You have to be trolling. Straw man after straw man with nothing more to support your position beyond your incorrect assumptions.  \n\nTerrorism isn't successful? Are you aware of the past 16 years in Afghanistan? First, the fighters in Afghanistan are hardly terrorists. They are fighting a war of attrition just like the colonists fought the British for independence. I'd say the fact that we have a President and aren't ruled by the British monarchy suggests that it *is* an effective war fighting tactic. \n\nAgain, you are either trolling or will refute any and all evidence contrary to your ignorant opinions so I won't be responding again. \n\nFor our futures sake, I hope you will actually read some history books. 
Name one other right in the Bill of Rights that is a collective right.\n\nThey are all individual rights. \n\n>It's a different but equally technically correct interpretation.\n\nIf you seriously want to learn what the intent is, read the Federalist Papers.

You're the 3rd person to make this same comment now...look down in the chain. I meant assault rifle, the correction doesn't really change the point. 
So lets just throw in the towel and roll over, huh? \n\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, they don't have access to F-16s, Tomahawk Missiles, UAVs etc yet we have been fighting them for 1.5 decades and it has cost taxpayers **T**rillions.  Just because citizens won't own the greatest arms available, guerrilla warfare is a valid, successful and proven military strategy. It's called attrition warfare. 
What do you mean going out? Like an axle seal? Wheel bearings? Shaft breaks? 
You can but how do you assert your right when someone usurps power and takes away your liberty?\n\nYou are going to protest peacefully? What happens when the government says you don't have that right? Without a way to ensure your rights are protected, they are liable to be taken away.\n\nThat is the entire premise of the 2nd Amendment and Madison expresses this in the Federalist Papers. 
Except that the Bill of Rights are individual liberties and have nothing to do with states rights.
Na, the Iris scanner on the Note 7 was almost instant. The only issue I ever had with the iris scanner was outdoors in the bright sun.

I have no reservations about the iris scanner after having the Note 7. \n\nI'd imagine the majority of N7 users will agree.

Shall not be infringed means shall not be restricted. While I agree that it wouldn't be a great thing for joe blow to be able to go and buy an RPG, all I am asserting is that the 2A does not allow for these "reasonable regulations", but rather the opposite. Our government has asserted that it *can* regulate arms.\n\nRead Madison's Federalist Papers No 46 if you want to know what he meant when he wrote the Bill of Rights. It's clear as day.
Agreed! Also, a militia member by definition is 17, not 16.
A part of me feels as though he's using more calories than those other two.

Summarily, for the duration of the reanimate corpse spell, they will get four followers. 
It really is a skill that pays dividends!\n\nAlso, I'll just add that making the right friends at the right MOS/Rank also has great perks.
Same happened to me. I have the Warrant for the NAM, however I honestly don't feel like putting in the effort for amending the forms. \n\n
National Archives is pretty much a solid. Also, they can give you free medals.\n\nBut once again, just check your DD-214 MBR-4, it has a box with the goodies on it. 
It is good to know that everything is as it should be. \n\nEdit: Status update, everything is still fine...
I can cook a dozen eggs in just a minute too! 
I have a leek, I have a cat, *Uh...* 
Wow! For them to clap so naturally at something they like is pretty neat. It appears to be a form of communication that has followed us throughout our evolutionary process as well. \n\nI like to think about how we do the same thing, especially at performances. Just like how we can be at a very sophisticated concert or play and right after it finishes, we immediately clap just like our primate cousins. 
Tried it, wasn't much of a fan.
If it were us, we'd not only get our National Defense Service Medal, but also a Combat Action Ribbon as the packaged deal! 
Man, same here. One time I ate something out of the trash. I didn't have to do it, in fact I wasn't even hungry. Never saw a scholarship from it.
But I can handle you at your tootiest. 
[National Archives.](https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/public/awards-and-decorations.html)\n\nAlso, MOL is not that bad when you just want to see your stack. Over in the Awards TAB, there's an actual picture of how it is supposed to look on your uniform. It'll be tailored to what's in the database.\n\nThe DD-214 MBR-4 should have a section as well.
Wouldn't that action result in the same answer every time? 
Good lookin', thanks!
Huh, I live off of KetoOne and I didn't know about the whole cinnamon thing.\n\nEdit: It turns out that they do use [Ceylon cinnamon](https://www.ketoone.com/pages/nutrition-ingredients).
I assume that these rocks were manually added by someone instead of grown there. 
Those tails are like an extra cat. 
Sometimes I also burst into tears and act like I don't know where I am.\n\nThat should seal the deal and give you the rest of the evening to yourself. 
Appreciate it, thank you! 
What an unexpected way to make friends.
But still, there's so much potential!

I wasn't on it, but I remember the USMC Recon and the ROKMC Recon did a ruck march together a while ago.\n\nThey did a round trip from Pohang to Seoul and back again.\n\nI tried to do a Google Maps link with a random walk route just to show you how far it is, but it's so far that it won't even allow me to try it.
I'm ok with NO ONE shooting at me, regardless of make and model of rifle. 
It's like slowly admiring a photo album! 
Not saying that there's a "safe" way to shoot at your recruits, but no one is even looking through their sights!
Same.
Depends, there was a definite gap in thought and ideas in the USMC. \n\nThere seemed to be a kind of cut off point for Marines in terms of what era they enlisted in. I noticed that some of the ones that were in for over a decade tended to lean more towards the conservative side. Not all of them mind you, anecdotally speaking there was a noticeable difference.
A little chocolate bunny!\n\n

I'm not necessarily on board with an "alarm"... seems too exciting.\n\nI'm more for a text from a grandparent informing us that nothing has changed. Seems more pleasant. 
Oh good! I'm not the only one then. For real though, I have found things in the trash that was wrapped up enough to the point where I found it acceptable. \n\nLuckily, the last person who threw their slice of pizza away had enough kleenex stuck to it where I knew it was still safe to eat.
Naw, I was always told not to move a person if they're in that situation. I'll gladly lay down next to you and keep you company until... what was it again? A mailman or an actuary? Yeah, a mailman arrives to properly assess the situation. 
Don't worry about it, he gets it all the time.

Depends, are you in a Reserve status such as IRR?\n\nIf not, you will not have access. Both Retired and IRR are considered the lowest you can go for having MOL permissions. \n\nAfter your IRR time has passed, you really don't have any affiliation with the Corps anymore and you lose a whole bunch of your data on MOL. It's a way to keep the "Locater" section clean (amongst other things). 
I like to think of them more as coworkers whom you share a drink with from time to time.

There was an Army LtGen who visited us Marines in Korea for Thanksgiving to give us a speech (I have no idea why). I got to hear him complain to an aid about the pony show he felt he was forced to do. \n\nLook, Mr. General Man, why bother? Just stay home and let us have our day off as well. You actually took EFFORT to drop your morale and subsequently drop ours too!

At a first glance, it seems like your rent money is being thrown away. Compared to owning a house, that may be true, but only if all other things are equal.\n\nConsider that by renting, you aren't getting *nothing* in return. You are gaining the ability to save at an accelerated rate, so you can afford a down payment on your house. By renting now, you are saving some financial risk so that you can comfortably afford a house in a short time.
I read "Bill Nye Answers a Difficult Ken M Question", was not disappointed.
I also lived a dozen miles or so from a nuclear power plant. One that resides directly over a fault line. I declined my pill every year. Best case scenario? Nothing happens. Worst case scenario? I become a ghoul and get to see how accurate Fallout was.
Lower value against the USD, nearly double the minimum wage (17.70 AUD/13 USD in Australia vs only 7.25 USD in the US)\n\nThat's why even digital downloads are more expensive. Just on currency conversion alone, things should cost more in AUD than USD. Then you factor in the huge disparity in minimum wage, and it makes a lot of sense that companies can get away with charging more in Australia.
You may not see this, but I wanted to ask a question that may not seem obvious: is there any possible way you can continue to live with your ex?\n\nWe don't know (and aren't entitled to know) the terms of your breakup, but if you can work something out to continue living with your ex, that potentially solves all your immediate problems. It may not be possible, but you're entering crisis mode. You need to do whatever it is you need to do to make sure you finish your training and have food/a warm place to sleep (for you and your pets).\n\nAlso, quit calling it an internship. That makes it sound like the program is doing you a favor. It's not an internship. It's a training program.

It's almost as if there are a bunch of different issues that we've lumped into the big category we call "regulation".\n\nAnd when someone says "regulation is good", opponents dismiss them as an idiot because they're only thinking of harmful regulations. And when someone says "regulation is bad", opponents dismiss them as an idiot because they're only thinking of beneficial regulations.\n\nNot that this is the case here (because this is an admittedly naive simplification of the issue), but it is an unfortunately recurring theme.
The very first thing I came up with was dicks. I could own a lot of dicks.\n\nThen I thought "there's probably not really a second-hand market for that many dicks" and decided I would just buy a lot of dollars.

You're wrong.\n\nSource: OP is full of shit, none of it makes it to the septic tank.

Just want to chime in and remind you: you're 13. As long as you're active and eating well-balanced meals, weight should mostly sort itself out. Don't snack on a bag of chips and drink two cans of soda every time you sit down to watch TV, but don't be afraid of eating "junk food" once in a while..
If you know the Fibonacci sequence, converting kilometers to miles is pretty easy.\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...\n\n5 miles is about 8km, 13 miles is about 21km. It's really only necessary to remember the first few numbers of the sequence, and multiple by 10, 100 (etc) to get where you want.\n\n1250km? That's a bit less than 800 miles.\n\n* 1250 is close enough to 1300, which is 13 x 100\n* The number before 13 is 8\n* 8 x 100 = 800\n* Actual value is 776 miles\n\n1500 miles? That's probably about 2300km.\n\n* 1500 is a bit more than 1300, which is 13 x 100\n* The number after 13 is 21\n* 21 x 100 = 2100, plus a bit more = 2300\n* Actual value is 2414km\n\nIt definitely is not exact, but it's generally within about 10% margin of error, and it makes converting distances much easier (especially when travelling, reading foreign news, etc). It doesn't take long for this method to get you within the ballpark when estimating distances.
Maybe a long shot depending on where you live, but if you have on i the area, try calling Planned Parenthood. They are about more than just abortions and birth control, and if they can't help you, they can probably point you to resources in your area to get you help working through your trauma.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't think that "succeeding in school is the only way to succeed in life." Effort and commitment are how you succeed. If you don't do well in highschool, you won't be able to go directly into a 4 year university, but you *can* take classes at community college (where you will also be able to get counselling/therapy for very cheap or free), and transfer to a nice university to finish your last couple years. You can also go into trade school, become an electrician, or mechanic, or plumber. They aren't glorified jobs, but they pay well, and can be very satisfying if you like working with your hands.\n\nGood luck with everything. Hope it all goes well.
It's never been about shame, it's all about the salt.

Something important to keep in mind about the "gun show loophole" is that any vendor who represents a licensed dealer is still required to follow federal and state regulations as if they were operating out of their store.\n\nThe "loophole" is *exclusively* about private party sales. Gun shows are just an easy way for private parties to congregate and sell/trade firearms. Being at a gun show doesn't convey any special leniency.
And you have to remove the body from your car to fill it up.
This completely depends on what you can afford. If your savings can afford the ~$6500 hit, pay the money (especially if they will reduce the charge for a lump-sum payment, try negotiating on the price with them). If you can't afford to pay it all at once, can your monthly income cover the extra expense? Will your tax returns be enough to cover the bill?\n\nWithout a better picture of your finances, we really can't make this decision for you.

Yeah, the movements were a bit ridiculous, but mentally I just treated them as a "stand-in" for whatever magic/cgi they didn't want to use so they could keep the audience speculating.\n\nI think my biggest issue was\n\nSPOILER:\n\n`\n\n`\n\n`\n\nthe fact that the show was split between making you think OA's story was true, and thinking that OA was schizophrenic (or was having some serious PTSD coping issues). I would have been okay with the rest of the in-universe characters having this dilemma, but as a member of the audience, I never had a character that I could root for. The show wanted *me* to be confused about whether or not OA was insane.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of people who think that was an interesting direction for the show, and enjoyed it, but it really kept me from thinking the show is great. At best, it was okay in my book.
From reading through, it also sounds as though he isn't being maliciously sexist, but he is simply ignorant of the issue on a larger scale. Keeping this in mind during your discussion will help you keep focused on correcting his misconceptions, rather than feeling like he is just "another sexist asshole", for lack of a better term.\n\nIt's true that many forms of prejudice are born of ignorance, but that doesn't mean all prejudice is hateful (a very, very common misconception). Some people have never had exposure that affords them a better understanding, and their beliefs are often mimicked from a respected person in their life (so they usually have very little reason/desire to go looking for contradictory information).\n\nGood luck with your conversation! As with any debate, don't let it devolve into attacking the *person*, keep it focused on discussing facts, and correcting misconceptions. If at any point it turns into yelling, just excuse yourself, especially since that will bleed over into the workplace.
Yeah, in California, I cannot purchase a firearm without also purchasing some sort of locking device, or providing a registered serial number for a safe I own. Lying about that information is a felony.

Computer science has nothing to do with operating a computer.\n\nI'm only being nit-picky because I'm a computer scientist by education (software developer by trade). The field of computer science is actually just math and logic, and has nothing to do with actual computers.\n\nComputer science is all about the theory behind computation. The "computers" we deal with are strictly mental constructs. They have a strict set of rules, which we basically take as axioms for proving whether or not something is possible (or, at least, what types of solutions and algorithms are possible).\n\nNow, I was taught a fair deal of software development during the course of my degree, but that was only so I could have a computer do my work for me. Many of my classes that were explicitly computer science classes (i.e., classes that the software engineers and other software development related degrees didn't take) didn't use computers at all. We used good ol' notebooks and pencils, because we were actually just doing math.
I love that Tommy misses a cue in that scene, and the whole conversation still happens, just all of Tommy's replies are late
To explain a little further: 72 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9. This makes it very easy to do quick, round math and get close enough for all practical purposes.

Castle Doctrine states don't give you the ability to shoot someone who is trying to flee.\n\nCastle Doctrine states give you the ability to use force (including deadly force) against any perceived threat, regardless of how that threat is or isn't armed.\n\nMaybe there are other laws in place in Missouri that allow this, but the concept of Castle Doctrine does not allow this. It simply relieves a person of their duty to retreat (avoid the conflict if at all possible, i.e. "just hand over the money").\n\nAlso worth noting, Castle Doctrine isn't a law, but a concept that is partially incorporated into various laws in a state. States who have sufficient laws to cover the concept of Castle Doctrine are commonly referred to as "Castle Doctrine states".
Can confirm: my dad worked his ass off to support us, and didn't take time for himself ever.\n\nRetired (more like rage-quit after driving a truck for 30 years), and died in an accident a few months later.

When filling out my mortgage, I had to sign papers that expressly indicated that I had no loans that I didn't disclose on the paperwork, and that none of the money I was using for a down payment was a loan.\n\nSure, you can trick them by not declaring that money as a loan, since they won't ask for the origin of all the money in your savings. You would still be committing mortgage fraud if the paperwork is even remotely similar to what I filled out, and I imagine all mortgages in the US have basically identical paperwork.
That's the dumbest advice ever. How am I supposed to ghost ride the whip?
Fun Fact: there is an [esoteric programming language named after Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Piet)
Your husband needs to start looking for a new job. Preferably one that he wants.\n\nWhen he finds one with a better salary than what he's got, he needs to go to his boss and renegotiate his salary. Don't reveal your new offer, just tell the boss "I'd like to be making what the company says my position should be making".\n\nIf they can't/won't do that, then your husband needs to accept the other offer. If he does take this route, he needs to be 100% prepared to accept the other offer.

It sounds like there are a few things going on here:\n\n1. You *want* a child, but you thought you couldn't have one\n1. You *don't want* an abortion, the reason for which isn't our business\n1. You *can't* adopt the child away, so you have to keep it\n\nThis sounds like you have two options, really, and they are entirely your decision to make. As others have said, you can have the child, but you have to be understanding of the father's desire not to be a father, and so he may leave. Or, you can try to reconcile your feeling about abortion if your relationship is that important to you.\n\nIt sounds like you actually want a child, and considering your age and history having difficulty conceiving (I'm assuming this, since you believed you were infertile), this really may be your one and only chance of having your own child. That, combined with whatever other reasons you have for not wanting an abortion, makes it sound like abortion is really not an option for you.\n\nThat leaves carrying the child to term. If you do, there are really only a few outcomes: Either the father leaves, or he stays and helps support you but doesn't help with the child at all, or something changes for him and he decides being a parent isn't all that bad of a thing. You have to go into this assuming you will be raising this child as a single mother, though.\n\nLike other people have said, the decision is ultimately up to you, but this is something you need to have a long, thorough discussion with your SO about.

If you forget to file expenses: nothing.

Hell, you risk that even when it's in your house. Certain uses of firearms in defense of your person or property (against intruders who are not armed), improper storage resulting in theft/use of the firearm by an unauthorized individual, ownership of certain calibers, models, and combinations thereof.\n\nYou build an AR-15 in California, and order the parts online. If you don't know that you can't legally have a standard mag release on it, you could be committing a felony by assembling a standard parts kit. Parts that are legal to own in California, just not installed on that particular style of firearm.
Certainly not the pinnacle. Halo 3 was a superior multiplayer experience. More balanced gameplay, far less bugs/cheaters, better graphics, and some much needed QoL improvements.\n\n*However*, I haven't played any FPS as much as I played Halo 2. I recently checked my matchmaking history, and had over 10,000 games recorded on Halo 2. This is at a time where I was also playing World of Warcraft. Halo 2 was the game that I got the most enjoyment out of on a console, because it was one of the easiest ways to continue hanging out with friends after school, and contrary to the "videogames are antisocial" trope, was a great way to socialize and make new friends.

This depends largely on your area. For $4000 you could get a 2002-2006 Toyota Camry or Honda Civic (two low-maintenance, reliable cars). If you want to get something much newer than that (2007-2010), you're going to want closer to $7000. Make sure you test drive the cars. Make sure they can get up to freeway speeds. Ask them where they get their oil changed (most people use the same lube shop, so the shop will have records of the visits you can check). Ask for a smog history for the vehicle.\n\nMost importantly: buy something that is bone-stock. Don't buy a car with a huge subwoofer in the trunk, or one where the owner put loud exhaust or body kits on it. If you want a reliable used car, you want to find the one that has been well taken care of. Aftermarket parts will decrease the reliability of the car.\n\nRemember to say "No" if something seems even a little fishy about the car. There are plenty of used cars available.
You can! Many parking lots contain signs saying which tow company services the lot, so if your car has been towed, you can find who has it.\n\nJust walk into one of the stores and ask to borrow a phone. Then call the number on the sign out in the lot, say you're <insert store here>, and that a vehicle is parked incorrectly, and needs to be towed.\n\nAlso, I am not a lawyer. This may or may not be totally legal. I don't really know.

And, like other heart-cross leaders, you only need to make the cross when your shield expires. If you sweep the floor and the next floor doesn't have a pre-empt, you retain your shield (and damage) bonus.
If you ever have nuts like that, please see a doctor. You have testicular cancer.
I watched that show, and I flipped between "That's a good show" to "Alright, this isn't really that good" like every other episode. The ending left me on the fence.\n\nOverall, worth the watch, I think.

One argument I've heard from a doctor friend (possibly only propaganda aimed at new doctors) was that the shit pay and terrible hours was partly to weed out people just looking for a big paycheck.\n\nYou wouldn't be able to work like that unless you really wanted it, and were able to stay consistently capable after a 30 hour shift.

Salusbury steaks\nGround beef (1lb)\nCream of mushroom soup \n1 Onion\nMushrooms\n1 tube Ritz crackers \n\nMy measures are guestimates btw\nTake about 1/3rd of the soup, mix it with a cup of water. (Not counting water as an ingredient)\nPut the rest of the soup in a bowl with the beef, along with chopped (or diced, don't be picky) onions and crushed up crackers.\nMix it all together with your hands, and form into patties, I can get five or six.\nCook at 350 for 25 minutes (I'm not 100% on the time, I'll check when I get home)\nSautee the mushrooms in some butter/oil/lard whatever works.\nIt's a great meal for cheap, goes great alone or with rice or mashed potatoes.

As a mechanic, '50's cars. They look good, but mechanically, suuuuuucked. No performance to speak of, much less keeping up with freeway traffic. Adjusting points is an absolute bear, constantly checking oil, and hoping that smell doesn't mean you have to open up that goddamn carb again.

And thank goodness we didn't listen. Isolationist policies are dumb.
Lots of people dont do their own taxes, or have a family member handle the finances of the house. Or they dont have good hearing any more, perhaps english isnt their first language, and get a younger relative to deal with the government on the phone for them. Plenty of people may work for a living but their spouse handles all the bills. Might be a dropout from school 50 years ago, made a living as a mechanic and goes hunting every year.\n\nThere is all sorts of reasons for why people might not want to or be able to handle dealing with financial stuff that doesnt make them a danger to themselves or any other person with a firearm. That alone isn't enough to automatically consider them incompetent in that area.\n\nFor that matter, the ACLU noted that many legally competent people were being included in this:\n\n> The rule includes no meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s \ntransmittal of names to the NICS database. The determination by SSA line staff that \na beneficiary needs a representative payee to manage their money benefit is simply \nnot an “adjudication” in any ordinary meaning of the word. Nor is it a \ndetermination that the person “[l]acks the mental capacity to contract or manage his \nown affairs” as required by the NICS.  Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly state that representative payees are appointed for many individuals who are legally competent\n\nhttps://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLU.pdf  <good overview of the issues with the legislation.\n\n\n\nNow, if my old mechanic example that doesnt deal with his own finances is also disabled in a way that makes them a danger to the public or themselves, they can still have their gun rights removed(as they should be) but that would require going through a proper process and getting that diagnosis from a qualified medical professional/court system.\n\nPeople being individually evaluated is how it was done before this overreaching change was put in place.
I think that's unfair to other Islamic nations. Countries like Lebanon, Turkey, and Kuwait are alright and can be pretty progressive as long as you avoid the rural parts (same can be said of Iran)

No... I really don't think you have to worry about the US government accusing you of being a spy and sending you off to a blacksite. Calling the US govt and Iranian govt equally dangerous isn't accurate.

And to see that distinction, you need an education and background in law. We should leave the legal opinions to those trained to properly form them and not to your average Joe on the internet. 
Again, I challenge you to civil discourse instead of name calling. No one is going to take you seriously otherwise.
An otherwise peaceful event?\n\nNo, the riots shut down the event. The event never happened.
I'm not saying this is indicative of the behavior of all liberals but my point was that generally speaking, it makes the left look bad. This is mostly a problem on college campuses with young millenials who just wanted to break things and punch people in the name of "social justice."

I get your point, which is where to draw the line but an AR-15 is an old, obsolete rifle. It's not a super duper killing machine like certain people want you to believe.
The modern college environment is scary. It's such a weird, transparent indoctrination to an ideology.

People that have been paying attention to Europe know that this has been an ongoing problem.\n\nViolence, riots, gang rapes and yes, Sharia patrols are happening across Sweden, Germany, France, Denmark etc with very little MSM coverage.\n\nBut if I have reservations about mass Muslim immigration due to Islam's very obvious cultural deficiencies, I get labeled a bigot. 
Sounds like you tried real hard. 
You said racist again so what in her Twitter posts can you label as racist since race and ethnicity wasn't mentioned once? You can't because you're an idiot.\n\nIt seems like she wants illegals to be deported like millions of other Americans. At the end of the day, wanting secure borders and responsible immigration enforcement is not racist no matter how loud you stomp your feet and shout "racism".
Haha..not a bad joke, though I should correct you by saying I'm no Republican.
Holy fuck...get the play by play guy off the broadcast. Terrible commentary.
The fact that Trump was even tied into this report is utter nonsense.
Please...universities in the west are the epitome of liberal groupthink echo chambers. Don't act like conservatives can have an open dialogue on most college campuses because they will be labeled bigots, racists, fascists or whatever buzzword is trendy that week in an effort to shut down their opinion by discrediting them through baseless allegations.\n\nCollege campuses are great as long as you hold certain political and social opinions.
Modern M16's and M4's are not automatic weapons. They are semi-automatic with 3 round burst.
This was posted about a week ago. Her comments are a bit crude but nothing that warrants a suspension.
Yes, you can send it in to be fixed under warranty. It doesn't matter if you are the original owner.
But in your distorted view of reality she isn't allowed to express her opinions on immigration. Nothing she said was racist or offensive to a particular culture, race, ethnicity or religion because none of those things were mentioned. \n\nIt was off color, sure. But labeling someone a biggot for a social media post about immigration? I don't think so.
Yea, it was ported very well to the 3ds and the game is loaded with content for being a handheld platformer.

Impossible. Redditors assured me that the migrant crisis in Europe and their multiculturalism failures were made up by the alt-right. 
You seem to think that because I favor responsible immigration laws and border security that I am a Trump supporter that agrees with all of his policies, both current and future. The two aren't mutually exclusive.
She won 2 rounds out of 3.\n\nZing.
By "challenge him" do you mean physically attacking people attending his speeches, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in property damage and shutting down his events because of riots? Because that's what has been happening.\n\nThat's not challenging him. That's playing into his message, giving him more notoriety in MSM and making the left look like pyschopaths. \n\n
Well, Milo being an idiot doesn't change the fact that Lena Dunham is also an idiot.

That would make sense...if race was mentioned once.
It depends on where you live. For instance, food and clothing is not taxed in PA.
I agree. We don't need to play teams. It creates an absurb divisiveness that we just don't need. Most Americans are centrists (or at least I like to believe) and we can find common ground on issues as long as we as the public are informed and start discussing these issues with logic and legitimate ideas instead of emotion and talking points.
Yea..that's quite a sensationalized headline you got there.
It was late but we've seen much, much worse.
It's getting to the point where any conservative or libertarian political opinion is labeled hateful, inflammatory and/or offensive.
That's a pretty poor comparison.\n
Well, it helps if you tell me what country you are referring to.
Relax, virgin.
I think that's fair. No classification of people whether race, ethnicity, gender or orientation exists as a monolith.
I think there was only maybe one thread about it. It definitely deserves to be talked about.

Xenoblade is a N3ds exclusive so yes, you would need a n3ds with a c-stick for that game. \n\nI don't know if Monster Hunter requires it but I sure wouldn't want to play it without it.

Irony, eh?
Well, I suppose it won't matter if they are guilty or not because their name and reputation will be dragged through the mud no matter the outcome. 
Yea, r/politics is a toxic groupthink environment. It's pointless to even post there. 
Milo is an interesting guy. Even though I don't agree with a lot of what he says, I fully support his message regarding the regressive left's attack on free speech and the ridiculous movement that is third wave feminism.\n\nIt's pretty funny hearing idiots call him a racist, homophobe Nazi considering he is a gay guy who is ethnically Jewish that never shys away from talking about his relationships with black men.
I commend you for speaking honestly. I think the disconnect is that if people don't see it in their neighborhoods they don't think it's real or call it an isolated incident. 
Go run into a knife.
Yes, Pittsburgh is one of them.
I think any logically sound person echoes that sentiment.\n\nIt's difficult for societies to be inclusive when certain demographics want to be exclusive.

Oh, Christ.
Oh..sorry. I thought you wanted to have a conversation instead of childish banter.
That's interesting. I wonder how many of her bad experiences can be written off as simple trash talk and veteran players playing a rookie or young player very physically, something that happens in the NBA quite often. 
You're right but in this particular case, you are just throwing around the word racist and Nazi because that seems to be the trendy thing to do.\n\nListen to what he says. He is a troll and someone with very controversial opinions but at the end of the day, he is harmless. He isn't spreading messages of hate or violence or anything he gets blamed for.
Excellent post.
It was a fairly friendly exchange. Milo knew the audience and allowed Bill to get the rub while Milo benefits from the HBO platform and notoriety. Win/Win
To release alongside the Switch version of Smash Bros. I think it's fairly obvious at this point.
Oh, give me a fucking break. Even rich white women need their victimization points.
By killing a bill meant to allow more of them to be done?
I still haven't played Cave Story but Shovel Knight is one of the best games released in the last 5 years and might be my favorite in that time period. I'm happy I was able to snag a physical 3ds copy and an amiibo before they disappeared from retail shelves.\n\nThough it sounds like with the added expansion and price increase, Shovel Knight may see an updated print.
Impeached for deporting people that don't belong here?\n\nAm I the one going crazy or is it everyone else?
What lies? Tell me one lie in my post and I would be more than happy to source the reports that back my claims.\n\nInstead of throwing around racist and bigot in an effort to shut down civil discourse, why don't you actually respond with something of substance.
If you followed Milo's campus tour you wouldn't need to ask that question.
There is a price to pay for stealing and I hope you are paying for it with your 3ds.
Aww...they aren't staying to pick up all the fucking trash they left?
Considering there are retail hunting rifles with an effective range of 500+ yards, you might want to walk that argument back.  
I'm trying really hard to give a shit about this....\n\n\nYea, I just can't.
Good talking points but the numbers don't agree with you. It costs tax payers over $2 billion a year for the incarceration of criminal illegal imigrants. The Heritage study done in 2013 shows that illegal households do not pay in taxes enough to cover the services that state and federal government provide to a tune of a $15,000 deficit per household per year. \n\nAs for breaking up families, it's a tough situation that we as a country need to find a solution for. However, illegals that came into the country knew the game they were playing and the risks involved. They don't get a free pass on this either.
Precisely.
How do you justify forcing religious people to violate their beliefs? I believe in a free market and that money is the single motivator for businesses. I would contend that it is patently false to assume their housing choices would be "greatly" diminished. Diminished minimally maybe, but we don't get to tear up the Constitution. Should churches, synagogues, or mosques be forced to accommodate an lgbt wedding in your opinion? That is the next step, and then I don't even know what the first amendment means anymore.
I got a feeling the 2020 games are going to be very interesting politically.
That would be .001% of the federal budget per year. I don't think a wall will really work, as long as you have a welfare state people will still find a way to show up.
Not surprised. It was grossly over priced, and they had yellow queso, yellow!
Only one person has ever been indicted under the Logan act. It was a Kentucky farmer in 1803.\n\nMost recent accusations have been against Jimmy Carter, Jesse Jackson, and the Republican Senators who wrote a letter to the Iranian government when Obama was in discussions over the JCPOA.
What a completely sensible decision, good on ya Aussies.
Chill chill, he's just trying to launch Trump to Mars, be cool and he'll never figure it out until he's speeding past the moon at 30,000 mph.

The homemade tortilla machine was the shit, and the only thing that made that sludge of a cheese dip edible. 
Arizona is actually trying to "divorce" the 9th circuit because their overturned decision rate is so high. There is no doubt they tend to legislate from the bench far too often. Pretty cooky, fun to watch, it's always a "what are they going to do next?" game.
What a ridiculous man.
The nonsense notion of judicial activism is the only threat I see to the American court system. It's a basic principle, read the law, apply law. Judges don't make law, that's what Congress does. When judges start making ethical or moral decisions, they take the power out of the people's hands to create their own laws, that's not democracy.
Well, he's technically not wrong. It has been a hysterical reaction to a seemingly benign conversation between Flynn and the Russian Ambassador. However, those same lingering questions about the nature of the Russian's election influence campaign are still deeply troubling and virtually completely unexplained thus far. 
He has got to stop giving cavity searches for routine traffic violations.... /s
It's the top down federal mandates that prevent restructuring and choice.

You're an idiot, but i'm quite certain you know that.
How empowering?
No. Jim Crow was laws on the books in southern states, those businesses had no choice. This is essentially applying those same laws to religious people. Government has no business in religion, period. Capitalism is the solution, people get to choose if they want to violate their religious beliefs, and consumers get to choose if that place stays in business. It is grossly inappropriate for the government to mandate people violate their own beliefs.
Welp, that's terrifying..
The Taliban is the extreme arm of the Pakistani government to control the Afghan region. They have always been directed out of Islamabad. Ya, we armed them against the Soviets, with the help of Pakistan, who have always been their keepers.
OP is the kind of stupid that is frankly, dangerous.

Brookings Institute: Three ways to avoid poverty in America.\n\n1. Graduate High School \n\n2. Get a full time job (any full time job, even minimum wage)\n\n3. Don't get married or have children until at least age 21\n\nOnly 2% of people who follow these rules are in poverty. 75% are considered middle class (55k+).
This is crazy. The government just put a gun to religious people's head and said: you will comply, regardless of your religious beliefs. That's not ok.
USA USA USA USA USA USA!
In a word, Accountability, they require it, we don't.
Because i'm a fan, and have been a fan since the day I was born at Northside Hospital at 6:43AM 7/6/85. Because I have a team that the whole world dismisses and no matter the success of the season, they are my team, my city, my hopes. I love the Falcons for what they are and what they could be one day (Very. Fucking. Soon.). I know you wanted a dumbass answer to your dumbass question, but you got the ATL answer. So choke on it bitch, cuz we been here, and we gonna be here.
There is almost a decade worth of opinion pieces out there on this subject. The 9th circuit is kind of the opposite pendulum swing of a constructionist. Definitely read some highly regarded sources and make up your own mind, I have my opinion.
Classic Iranian, "we're victims of the big bad USA." No, you're victims of a theocratic dark age ideology. \n\nSo bizarre to see so many westerners aligning with the Iranian regime, who most certainly do not hold the same values. 
That family fucks.
I didn't down vote you! I'll make up for that jerk face though! The overturn rates are high as well almost identical, but they send a quarter of the cases, it's not really a controversial statement to say it has turned into more of a political "dog and pony show." I think everyone kind of accepts that as fact at this point. 
I mean, i'm pretty sure I have seen the "Norwegian arms dealer to Iran" character at least 25 times in movies. \n\n"Lock it down TSA, Lock it down" 
You have to be this educated to be this stupid.
This is like a college freshman "Intro to Religion" thesis. I don't know how to go about second guessing history, so I won't. You cannot believe in a powerful being without being religious, that is the literal definition of religion.
I think the protracted cabinet process has finally made McConell snap. He's supposedly a Senate rules savant, this could get medieval.

Nothing threatens Islamic Extremists like equal protection under the law. If we are all equal under the law then why can they get away with beatings, stoning, beheading, intimidation, or disfiguring people. The rule of law is the most important concept for a country to develop and advance. The people in power will never freely share that power with the people.
It's probably the result of climate change! /s
I didn't say there was nothing, but i'm not going to lose my mind over unsubstantiated innuendo. Show me evidence the campaign was coordinating with Russian officials and impeach the asshole, otherwise it's just disgruntled political espionage from within the bureaucracy. Flynn definitely lied about talking to the Russian ambassador about sanctions, but that's not putting anyone in jail.
Damn, that's a lot of terrorist attacks. 
I'm so proud of my Falcons! 
Socialism works! /s .. Anyone with a brain can see the simple math was never going to work. "I'm breathing, give me stuff" makes bad policy. 
Again, those previously stated anti-discrimination laws had nothing to do with religion.\n\nSo what does religious freedom mean now? A person can only practice their beliefs at church and home? That's not freedom to exercise my right.\n\nI'm not even religious or care at all about gay rights. I do care about government overreach. It's completely inappropriate. The government has no business in marriage. It should be completely out of all marriage. The government marriage license means nothing to religious people, what their respective institutions say is what matters. I've seen this coming down this pipe for years now. First, "what happens in my bedroom is none of your business", true. Then, "marriage is a right of all people regardless of sexual orientation", fine with that. Now, "you will be forced to participate in my marriage regardless of what you believe, or the government will show up with guns and shut you down", officially crossed the line.
This is the stuff that drives people crazy. There is compassion and then there is common sense. It's not "mean" to enforce laws.
You lost me at "Massive Government Crackdown".....
It goes against American values to say the Ukrainian people don't get to choose their own government. Russia has no legitimate claim to forcibly take territory from a sovereign nation.
They love these types of covers, they've done Merkel as Mother Teresa, George Washington with a bullet in his head, and Bush as Rambo. They get great publicity out of it.
The missile system was placed in Romania as an anti-ballistic missile battery aimed at Tehran. It just so happens to be pretty close to Moscow as well. I can guarantee you, that system is going no where until Mr. Putin makes a full withdraw from the Ukraine. 
We spend the 5th amount of money per student in the world. Per that investment in our children, we have rec'd the 17th ranked educational system. Many many factors contribute to this phenomenon (in my personal opinion we have the worst parenting generation in the history of the world). The argument that the status quo is acceptable doesn't really compute for me. DeVoss most likely doesn't have a clue, but at this point how long do we keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result? Give it back to the states, the feds have failed.
Did Mr Snowden really think he was anything more than a piece on the chess board when he "happened" to end up in Russia.
1. The florist had served them for 10 years, no problem.\n2. Only when asked to participate in what she considers a religious sacred ceremony, did she refuse service.\n3. She offered them a list of available florist to fill their request.\n4. They sued her.\n\nI would contend she's not the "bad guy" here.\n\nThere is a thing called common sense. The government should not compel religious people to participate in ceremony they find counter to their beliefs. I love that you use the extreme examples to prove your point on religious conduct aspect. I would ask you don't use the extreme marginal cases to paint broadly. "Hard cases make bad law" is a particular phrase you may want to look up in reference to your "poor, gay, Alabama hard case".  
Why are you wearing a helmet? /s
All the reports I have seen just say that he told them not to overreact to sanctions. It's not really unusual for a NSA to reach out to other countries. The FBI has said they interviewed him and did not recommend charges and they have actually read the transcripts of the conversations. There is plenty of other "smoke" out there to look into, but this one particular incident seems, as previously stated, fairly benign.
Totally, if that happened. Only thing they kind of have him on right now is the communication with the ambassador on the day Obama dropped the sanctions, which was after the election.
Sad story, but is the intent to blame immigration law for this guy killing himself, because .. "that dog won't hunt monseigneur." 
Your first argument is ridiculous, no one dies in any scenario we are discussing, stop. Your second argument is a baseless personal attack, moving on. Third, do I think amendments are unconstitutional? No, the people got to decide, that's called democracy.\n\nWelcome to America, where people get to be, and believe, whatever they want.\n\nThat court decision is hilarious. How in the hell do you propose we legislate equal "treatment" in the commercial market? It makes less than zero sense, and has nothing to do with religion. Participating in what religious people consider a sacred ceremony has everything to do with religious freedom.\n\nAnd i'm going to insist you answer my previous question, should the government mandate that churches, synagogues, and mosques participate in an lgbt weddings?\n\nWhen the government starts to tell you what to believe, you should be terrified. That's called tyranny.
It's strange to see people excited that the US Gov't is supporting an authoritarian regime rather than a democratic success story of the Pacific. I get the politics, but the values are fucked.
Shouldn't the law protect everyone equally? You want to make law that protects "vulnerable" groups at the expense of the majority. "Government is not the solution, it's the problem." \n\nI could make a pretty good case that religious people are a "vulnerable" group in terms of majority opinion. It's incredibly popular to denigrate Christians, it's become a sport on college campuses, and in the media I see more lgbt friendly programming than religious programming. \n\nThis really boils down to one thing, should the government compel a private business to participate in a religious ceremony by force, I say no way. I don't think you will be convinced by my argument and i'm not convinced by yours, I base my argument on the 1st Amendment of the Constitution, you base yours on "feelings", so I guess we are gridlocked. I don't think your opinion comes from a bad place, I do believe you want to protect people, but government intervention is not the answer. \n\nIn this scenario, the gay couple is the only one doing anything by force. It's inappropriate, and tyrannical.
Oh shit! Haha.
Since it's required, and since the funding is tied to it, the test are all essentially the same, narrow competition is the result. They choose the one easiest for teachers to teach so they can guarantee funding. It's not about the students anymore, it's about teaching the test to get the money. 
Agreed. Details matter, everyone needs to stop "painting with broad brushes."
For the sake of Yemen and it's people I hope this isn't true. The Tehran funded rebels they are fighting require more resources than they have available.
Perhaps, legally it sounds more like a constitutional crisis, although i'm admittedly vague on the latitude judges have in Sweden.

I'm looking for the big leak, Snowden style. So far we have people from inside the intel community anonymously giving statements. Where is the hero who will come forward with hard data? They have the transcripts, I want to see them. It's entirely possible Flynn lied to everyone about the sanctions call, although it's hard to believe he wasn't instructed to make the call by the President, but again, that's not illegal. My only point with the post was none of this stuff is good enough for prosecution, and even the NYT article this morning said there is no evidence of coordination with the campaign and the Russians. I'm not going to hyperventilate for no endgame. 
If the being dictates nothing then you are your own God. Congrats!
Either the Independent is the most bogus rag ever written or they have the best sources in the history of D.C. reporting. Honestly, it could be either one at this point.
Super quadruple double secret LOL! \n\nGet back on your meds kid.
Then why do we have unequal learning environments. It's because individual accountability is not the top priority. Teachers and school boards are more concerned with keeping their jobs and funding rather than doing what every other sector in the economy does, promote the best, get rid of the poor performers.
Except for the fact that men and women have different rights under those laws, because they see men and women as having different roles, so in the classical sense, they are not treated as equals.
See above post on judicial activism. I don't know anything about it, but i'm quite certain that sentence was not carried out by the law, but rather by the whims of a judge.
Well, the Hill, who has subpoena power, is taking over with multiple investigations. The truth never stays hidden, but I hate the idea of faceless national security people leaking unverifiable stuff, that's super creepy.
Rock bottom loser.
No, a gofundme donation is voluntary.
Our laws supersede religious law. Religious freedom is protected, but religion is not a defense for discrimination. Equal protection means one thing to western law, and that one thing (human is human) is not congruent with Sharia. If one set of anything carries more weight than another thing, that is not equal, no matter the rational. 
If you can't even talk to someone who disagrees with you, it doesn't make you principled, it makes you a weakling. 
I don't think you really have a concept of how many federal regulations there are on schools and how those mandates divert funds which could be used differently on a case by case basis. While equality was the goal, nothing about each individual school, community, or student is equal. For your example, the company used for that standardized testing was required by the federal government, they don't allow for choice or competition.
Yeah, but then he is free to be with someone who respects herself and him.... I'm not suggesting leaving her for leverage or something.
He's probably talking about the Georgia Tech student who was convicted on terrorism charges in 2009. That kid never got to the act, he was caught before the attack was carried out, but it was an Islamist driven plot.\n\n[Convicted in 2009 for material support to terrorism including the 2006 Ontario attacks.](http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/10/georgia.terror.trial/index.html?eref=ib_us) 
I think you should be able to do whatever you want. It's kind of our founding principle. I don't think the government has any business mandating how people run their own private enterprises. Do I think people should be allowed to do those things above, yes. That doesn't mean I don't think your an asshole if you do, and I would never give a dime to those businesses who practiced those policies. My point is, it is inappropriate (and almost certainly unconstitutional) for the government to mandate to citizens they violate their religious freedom.
Christianity went through an intellectual enlightenment, Islam has not, that's why one of them throws gay people off buildings and one just says I don't want to make you a wedding cake. This comparison is horrific.
No question in my mind TJ would approve of this display of freedom and personal sovereignty!

Over the last four terms they have sent 26% of the total docket of the SCOTUS. They have been overturned at an 80% rate. So they send a disproportionate amount of cases and are overturned at a high rate. Their reputation precedes them.
Do assholes and psychopaths exist, of course they do, but i'm pretty proud this kind of violence isn't government or even church sanctioned like it is elsewhere.
Falcons fan here, native Atlantan, never been so jacked in my life!
Now that I think about it, it's got to be sketchy for the rest of the world when a country of essentially "anarchist cowboys" elects a new dude to run a 7000 strong pile of nukes every four years. Just do what we do here in the states, walk around tense, all day, everyday!
You're making a false equivalency. 83% of Americans identify as Christians and only 35% of Americans oppose gay marriage, maybe the the US isn't as hateful as you want or perceive it to be. State sponsored homophobia is not really a phenomenon in Western cultures anymore, it is quite strong in the particular part of the world I was talking about. So if we have to choose which faiths are progressing, and which is extremely dangerous for homosexuals, I know my answer.
I think you nailed it, the fall of the Ottoman Empire and consolidation of power by a few is probably most to blame. The Ottomans were actually a quite diverse society with different cultural norms mixing and matching and a willingness to engage in the world outside of themselves.

Religion can control people. That doesn't mean it does control people in every case. If it does control people, what does it control them for most consistently throughout history, to be honest, faithful, not murder, to not steal, to help the weak, to be kind, to be patient, etc. I'm not religious, but I also don't see all religion as evil because there is ample evidence of good people who are religious. You can argue that religion is not a necessary to develop the concept of right and wrong. I could also argue that all mainstream concepts of right and wrong over the last millennia are inherently based on religious teachings. \n\nAbstract thought is good for the soul. Try it.
When the ACA first came out, I think it was Bill Maher that described it as a blowjob to the insurance companies. Reading this thread it's amazing how right he was. \n\nAs a Canadian, this is all just making my head hurt. How do you people not rise up and demand better? How do you elect people who would dare to suggest that something like a lifetime maximum or denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions is acceptable? In my province of BC, health insurance is $75 per month for an individual or $150 for a family. It doesn't matter how old you are or how sick you are. If you're below a certain income, the fees are waived, because the health of our citizens matters. Some of you are paying $800 A MONTH? Some have a $12000 DEDUCTIBLE?? Are you fucking KIDDING ME? I don't have the right synonyms for "appalling" to describe how fucking awful and inhumane that is.

Don't think you can attach a debit card to your iTunes account, though. 
But he doesn't think that because the umpire is clearly signalling that he's safe! That's why he's coming off the plate looking to see if he's got another play. \n\nAnd this was arguably an incorrect interpretation of the rule about what the umpires should do if a video review overturns the first part of a play, thereby affecting subsequent plays.
A lot. So ending NAFTA means one of two things, both of which increase the price of goods for US customers: tariffs, or repatriating manufacturing. If companies have to spend the capital to create plants here anyways, they're going to be massively automated to minimize the effect of having to pay higher wages, and those capital costs will likely to be passed along to the consumer. 
I've seen "the necessary" used as a very old-fashioned euphemism for the bathroom, so I automatically assumed this was a weirdly distorted way of saying one was taking a shit.
Yeah, just get this several-hundred-dollar accessory instead of hoping for a rather obvious use of location services and calendar events. 
It's going to be part of the NAFTA renegotiation. He'll present numbers that whatever new deal he gets with Mexico and Canada brings at least $X billion to the US, meaning Mexico just funded the wall. 
Legit surprised I haven't seen the iPhone mentioned yet.
Right, but the spirit of replay is to reduce injustices, not create new ones. Also, I'm not as sure as you that the protest would be obviously denied. He wasn't protesting a judgement call, and video review is new enough that it's possible this specific play hadn't been addressed. 
Yeah, welcome to reddit. 
This was taken from Earth. That's why it's all wavy, from the atmospheric distortion. Someone pointed a telescope at the edge of the moon just as Saturn was coming out from behind it. 
Bizarre timing, given that they've just introduced the second of new products in the last couple of years that currently sit atop their respective fields, in the Watch and AirPods.
That is the entire point of Match, yes. The song limit is considerably larger than your library. Six figures, iirc. Apple Music provides the same functionality. 
Oh I was thinking a round of 32 bye. So everyone plays the group stage, but then you give the top group stage performers a bye through the first round of the knockout round. Kind of like the NFL playoffs. 
Because it was a pass attempt, not a shot, this is covered by the rule about the defence accidentally causing the ball to enter their own basket. Two points. The only point of confusion is whether the basket gets credited to the last attacker to touch the ball, the team captain, the nearest attacker to the defender that scored, or the team as a whole. 
But since he didn't, and shouldn't be expected to based on the first base umpire's call, a protest is not unreasonable, which was the point I was responding to. I think to make things fair they should give the umpires the ability to nullify the play completely in a situation like this. 
He wants there to be a passcode required to turn the phone off. Most thieves know now that if you don't shut off a phone immediately it can be tracked. Ideally, the same code that you use to unlock the phone should be required to shut it down, thus giving the owner more time to try and recover it.
Is it the lead runner? I thought it was the first runner to occupy the base. So R1 and R2, ball is hit to the outfield, R2 rounds 3rd heading home, R1 rounds 2nd heading to 3rd. R2 realizes he's dead to rights at the plate, stops, retreats to 3rd. Before getting back to 3rd, R1 arrives at 3rd and occupies the base. R2 then joins him, also occupying third. The defense tags both runners. R1 was the first to legally occupy the base, so he is safe and R2 is out.
Yeah, but the actual fighting, from what I've heard, was as bad or worse, and more frequent. The advent of helicopters meant combat missions could go way more often, instead of having to march troops into place over several days. In terms of total troops deployed, you're right, there were only about 2.5M US troops in Vietnam, compared to ~16M in WWII.
Not really. A big reason for that shift was to allow a much longer Voyageurs Cup competition. This will actually mean a much shorter period between the crowning of the Canadian champion and the entry into CCL.
Red Bull as a whole could refuse to sell any of their players to anyone but RBNY. If he's set on coming to MLS though, VWFC could put a discovery claim on him which would give them right of first refusal. It's unlikely RBNY would have him on their discovery list, since you're only permitted five claims and they wouldn't have room for every prospect on Red Bull clubs.
Kind of in the same vein:\n\n"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"  \nRichard Dawkins *Unweaving the Rainbow*
I like Hot Fuss, but I think Day and Age is even better.
Wow, that is fucking pathetic. Who the fuck downvotes for trying to offer a reason OP might have a point?
No, but that doesn't factor in video review. In this case, they're changing the first part of the play, which affects the necessary behaviour from the defence for the rest of the play. He's not protesting the tag call, he's protesting that it's unfair to allow the video review to change the tag call when his defence no longer has the ability to properly react to an out call on the runner. 
I'm pretty sure you still can, but if I could just type, I would. There needs to be a hands free way to do it or the whole thing is pointless. 
The distance from Earth to Saturn is 1.2 billion kilometers when the two are at the closest point in their orbits. Earth and moon average about 384,000 km apart. Saturn's radius is about 34x that of the moon's. You're looking at a telescopic view of Saturn that includes part of the moon to create a cool perspective trick.
Fuck, man, poor Allen. That ball is probably incomplete unless he comes diving in and gets his hand between it and the ground. 
The best part about the second question is nobody even knows what antiquity looks like. It's all clouded by people's perceptions of what their youth was like. 
Not with the ST package, no. Whitecaps use a points system. You get points for buying your ticket, points for buying food in the stadium, points for answering trivia questions from their social media accounts throughout the year. Each year for the last five or so one of the perks you can redeem points for (if you're fast enough) has been the current FIFA.
Sure, do it, just remember that unless you've been counting cards and the deck is rich, you're likely hosing yourself by splitting up a very solid hand. \n\nMost of the "superstitious" players I've ever encountered only get pissed off when somebody does something that's counter to basic strategy and it messes up their hand. E.g., you stay when you should hit and the second card after that is one that the superstitious player needed. Playing basic strategy was the fastest way to get people not to be pissed off at me anymore.
Yeah, that's probably why I never really liked it. Don't much care for country. Hero of the Day and Until It Sleeps are great. Ronnie's a really good and underrated track.
I'm aware of the math. Try using reason to convince superstitious people that their superstition is unreasonable and let me know how it goes for you. 
Yeah that's a fair comment. What I would suggest is voting as far left as you can possibly get. It was encouraging to see Sanders do as well as he did in the primary. You guys need politicians that don't think socialism is a dirty word.
The job number is secondary for him. He wants big companies to move here so he can spin that. His supporters, in their bubble, will never hear about the fact Apple's new plant only needs 100 workers instead of the 1,000 that were needed in China, they'll just see propaganda about great American companies moving operations back to America.
The distinction is in "takes a three point shot." There's a difference between a shot and a pass in other codes. So if you're clearly not shooting, you haven't attempted a three point field goal. \n\nThink of this, the offence is down 2 with seconds to play, having just been scored on. They inbound and chuck the ball downcourt, clearly intending to pass to a player for a tying shot. Unable to steal cleanly, the defence flails and knocks the ball in the air, deflecting it into the basket as time expires. No way should that be 3 points and a win for the offence. The only reason they've scored at all is a cock up by the defence. (Not disputing your interpretation, just think the rule is wrongheaded.)
Any context for this? 
Nope. Part of the gambler's fallacy. They only notice when it hurts them. 
Not sure. My wife's with TD and hers is Visa debit. I'm with Tangerine, which is owned by Scotiabank, and they don't.
Well I don't propose they should actually show all of that, just that the "hail the planet and bloop, there's the leader chilling out and apparently not busy running a planet" that they always depict is amusingly unrealistic. 
Google "Apple Energous" and read the first couple of entries. Apple is rumoured to be working on wireless charging at a distance. 
They really aren't. They fear a completely different set of problems than exist here. A set overblown and disconnected from reality. If you laid out exactly what goes on here and what goes on there, I highly doubt many people would pick their system. 
Just a small point, /u/gumpstumps, the title should be Vancouver SG, singular. There are two other supporters groups in Vancouver and I doubt the Southsiders would presume to speak for them.
It's supposed to ensure that the Southsiders aren't running events where some of their members, due to an accident of birth, are unable to participate. 
My goodness. Couldn't they divert some resources from paying off match officials to put this thing through some focus groups with actual fans?
OP said he used CarPlay. Does that allow 3rd-party apps? I thought you were limited to stock. 
Is it a visa debit? A lot of banks and credit unions issue debit cards that are incompatible with online transactions. Especially outside of the US.
No doubt gonna get downvoted to hell for this but here we go. I don't understand why people have such low success rates with Siri. I use it frequently to set timers, to change settings, to get directions, to change music, to send texts. I would say my success rate is between 90-95%. \n\nMy biggest frustration with Siri is that I can't spell to it. The other day I was going to a local bakery called Breka and asked it for directions. Fail. Tried to send me to some town in Norway with a similar name, which is hilariously wrong. If I'd been able to say get me directions to Breka, spelled bee-are-ee-kay-eh, I assume it would have found the local bakery no problem.
NASA is already planning missions to metal-rich asteroids. That problem will be resolved soon enough. Petroleum is a more difficult problem, but as we transition away from gasoline powered cars in the next 100 years the demands on that resource become much less, giving us more time to find plastic alternates. Today could be the peak, but I honestly think enough smart people are working on major problems that we'll be ok. 
Suits.\n\nEvery dramatic conversation:  \nPerson A: "You son of a bitch, you did X!"  \nPerson B: "What the hell are you talking about?"  \nA: "You know! You did X!"  \nB: "Nuhuh!"  \nA: "Yahuh!"  \nB: "Well ok, yahuh, but I had to because Y!"  \nA: "Well you better fix it, or else!"  \nB: "You wouldn't!"  \nA: "Try me!"  \n*One person storms out, the camera zooms to the other person looking constipated.*
You would not be. The difference might be small, but over a long enough period you'd lose. 
It's the difference between a pass and a shot. If the referee determines that the player is shooting, the attempt is worth three points. If she's passing, then this would be covered by the rule about the defence causing the ball to enter their own basket, which is always two points. 
This was actually a de-escalation technique they used to teach to umpires. Coach gets all heated and in your face, turn slightly so he's not in your face and it's more of a conversation than a confrontation and walk very slowly in the direction of his dugout. Worked like a charm.
Canada. Most of the banks up here issue debit cards without Visa or MC payment processing. They've all banded together to create the Interac payment processing system that's Canada-specific and doesn't interface with most places. That was one of the big holdups in getting Apple Pay up here in the first place. A couple of banks, TD Canada Trust for instance, issue Visa debit cards, but most don't.
Dubya was a lot of things, but I never got the sense that he was dangerous the way Trump feels dangerous. Looking at Trump, his advisors, and the Republican party in general right now makes me feel like they have aspirations beyond an 8-year term, and not in the traditional "let's keep winning elections" sense. It makes me more than a little worried to be sharing an undefended border with them.
Over a dozen members have reportedly advised the Southsiders that they would be affected by the EO. 
Someone's been doing it wrong.
I'm not sure what rule set you're quoting. NBA and fiba both include definitions of a field goal attempt that require the offensive player to be attempting to shoot the ball. From the NBA rules: "5.1.c. A successful field goal attempt from the area outside the three-point field goal line shall count three points." That's the only mention of scoring three points. So if you're not attempting a field goal, you can't score three points. This would be an accidental field goal, and would count 2 points. 
Didn't realize the scoring was that low. That's interesting. Doesn't change my perception of the tournament though, and as others have noted there were several excellent low-scoring games. \n\nI wonder if, in a 48-team tournament, you could do a first round bye or something to incentivize teams to play less cagey. Or borrow an idea from rugby and award points for high scoring. 
I once came out of the changing room ready to umpire a ball game and found the diamond covered with a swarm of bees. Partner and I looked at each other and noped the fuck back to the room for twenty minutes. \n\nLater that day I got home, about five to ten minutes from the park, and found that a swarm of bees, probably the same one based on the way they'd been flying, had taken up residence in the outer wall of our carport. It was surreal. 
All about the money. Using their own payment processor means they get to keep and share all the transaction fees. Fuck the consumer.
How do you know? Lots of places use modified FIBA. 
Teacher starts one of our first lectures on Sex Ed. Gets a couple of minutes in and is going over the basics of the anatomy. Diagram of the female reproductive system is up on the overhead. Dude just gets up and starts walking for the door, but faints before he gets there. Full on face plant. Continued to get woozy at every Sex Ed class to the point where they just let him stop coming to class.
That depends on which rules are being used. I just looked up FIBA's rules, and the basket would be credited to the team captain. 
Surely it won't, on its own. But surely we will feel better knowing we're taking a stand against injustice than we would organizing a trip that some of our friends can't participate in because they were unlucky enough to be born in the wrong country.
I can't see Apple ever implementing wireless charging in its *current* form. It's actually less useful because you can't move, and therefore use, your phone while it's on the pad. There's enough rumours about the Energous form of wireless charging that I'd be kind of surprised if it doesn't feature in this year's phones. 
Yeah, every system has its flaws and we certainly gripe about ours, but NOBODY up here is clamouring for the horrendous clusterfuck down there. \n\nWhat happens is you end up with some long delays for non life threatening illnesses, mostly because people who need immediate care get it immediately. So people with the resources sometimes hop the border to jump the queue. 
Yeah, I'm sure it has its uses, but I also think this is Apple's wheelhouse. Good idea, but not implemented as well as it could be. 
We have luxury health care up here too. That's for things like massage therapy when your back hurts. Gotta pay extra for that or get an extended health plan. Basic shit like going to the hospital or your GP? You guys are getting hosed so bad I don't even know. 
I have not noticed the punchability, possibly due to being busy staring, slack-jawed.
There's plenty of fragmentation still. FB messenger gets a lot of group chat use, for instance, in addition to WhatsApp. 
For me it's nail files. Any time someone's filing their nails nearby I have to look away and possibly plug an ear.
I find the traffic data to be a little more accurate in Google, but I prefer Apple because it's tied in to the OS. I just use Apple unless I'm really pressed for time and need to shave a couple of minutes off my commute.
I THOUGHT I was ok! I was trying to pass that dude up ahead and didn't see anyone behind me, then suddenly HOLY SHIT THERE'S A PISSED OFF AUDI DOING 200 AND BLINKING ITS HEADLIGHTS RIGHT BEHIND ME!!\n\nAutobahn is crazy, man. 
I love the bridge of the USS Apple Store. I hate that it takes 42 seconds to warp from Earth to Vulcan and that anyone would consider crewing the bridge of the flagship of the Federation with cadets.
Look at you all optimistic. I hope you're right, but I have my doubts.
Meghan Markle kept me watching way after I was done with it. 
Yes. Visa and MC work fine. Amex too. It's the debit cards that deal with unsupported payment processors that won't. 
Don't care much for the format, but I like the expansion. I'd prefer they keep the 4-team groups. Top 2 from each group go through. Best 4 3rd-place teams go through. Remaining 8 3rd-place teams play off for the final 4 spots.
It accomplishes the only thing it set out to do. 
My favourite is in basically every Star Trek episode where not only is the planet completely homogeneous, but when they hail the planet, regardless of time or day, the leader just happens to be sitting around in a room ready to respond instantly to the Enterprise's call. No working your way up from the switchboard through multiple levels of functionaries and lackeys when the captain of a Federation starship comes calling.
Good to know. How recent is that? I've been a credit union guy for a long time, and when I switched to Tangerine, which is Scotiabank-owned, I still didn't get a visa debit. 
There's a kennel for the police dogs and a stable for the police horses. Separate buildings, unfortunately for your daydream.
Since when was that a policy? We've been doing overtly political statements yearly since 2012 at least.
Well in a horribly twisted way they're not COMPLETELY wrong. There are definitely bureaucrats who control what is and is not covered by the health care up here, but we're talking like whether or not a new, expensive, experimental treatment is going to be covered. If you're sick and your doctor says you need heart surgery you go and get the heart surgery. If you have extended health care you can get yourself a private recovery room instead of having to share with other patients.
FIBA rule 16.2.2, "If a player accidentally scores a field goal in his team’s basket, the goal counts 2 points and shall be recorded as having been scored by the captain of the opposing team on the playing court."\n\nEdit: 15.1.2 also matters. "The act of shooting: Begins when the player starts the continuous movement normally preceding the release of the ball and, in the judgement of an official, he has started an attempt to score by throwing, tapping or dunking the ball towards the opponents' basket."
I think that while mulligans don't really make sense in politics, one of the situations where they DO make sense is when a winning side, literally immediately upon winning, start walking back some of the core parts of their platform, leading to a large drop in the winning side's support. The polls suggest that a repeat referendum would result in a remain vote. If circumstances change, should people not be given the chance to correct what they now see as an error?
Hey man. There is a way. Economy of scale. Everyone in BC (4.631 million) is on the Medical Services Plan. Every adult not a dependent post-secondary student pays the premium, which maxes out at $75 per adult. Other provinces do it differently, but it's always similarly affordable.\n\nHere is the BC Government's MSP page, if you don't believe me. http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/premiums\n\nNow as for taxes, yeah mine might be higher. The price of socialism. If you want to compare, last year I paid just under $16k tax on just over $84k, for a total effective tax rate of 18.76%. How about you?
I'm not sure if you read the statement or not, but there's a couple of things here. First, all fans are free to make their own decisions with regard to away travel. The Southsiders will still be coordinating ticket buying for away matches, they just won't be organizing bus trips as they usually do to Cascadian away games. Second, it's not about doing any good. We don't expect to influence anything by this decision, but we also can't look ourselves in the mirror if we say we're going on this trip... except you, because you were born in Sudan or wherever. If some of our friends are being discriminated against, we all are.
It's pretty, but a truly modernized hoop kit would have to read "BELL" instead of "WHITECAPS".
Hindsight is 20-20 but they legitimately thought that pretty much anyone in the rest of the Republican field would have trounced her. I'm not sure they're wrong.
There may still be a trade deficit, but it will be tarriffed. It's not clear that any of these options provide a win for the American public. Remember that Mexico is the 2nd-largest foreign purchaser of American goods after Canada. If you start taking away large numbers of Mexican jobs by pushing manufacturers to come back to the States, you significantly decrease the buying power of one of your largest customers. 
Yeah, I just checked. Unless you bank with a financial institution like TD that issues Visa debit cards, Canadian debit cards (most of which are processed by Interac) won't work with iTunes.
Don't really think that's ideal. Of the three, only the Impact really have an appropriately sized stadium for CPL. You'd piss off a LOT of fans and lose big on attendance in the short term. I think the Welsh model is for us. Small domestic league with a few big clubs playing in the neighbour's bigger league. 
That's an interesting perspective. I can see why people entering the workforce in the 80's might have a different perspective than WWII vets, but I wonder why boomers would have the same perspective. Wouldn't a large number of them have run smack into at least the tail end of Vietnam? 
When I was a kid I LOVED Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future. Children's show, ostensibly, but with some pretty dark themes. Early J. Michael Straczynski work. Keep waiting for it to come back.
People are certainly free to do that. I imagine no small number will. We're simply asking them not to do so with Southsiders scarves on as a gesture of solidarity. 
LOL. All right, I concede. I'm Canadian, so I'm not familiar with US high school rules. That seems like a ridiculous interpretation though, even if it is explicitly mentioned in the casebook. 
Exactly. I did a doubletake when I saw the title, because that's basically the stereotypically bad idea with exs.
Ok you may feel that way, but it doesn't make it murder...
Yeah sure they may be somewhat more moral than their shitty neighbors, but that's not saying much. They've killed 10s of thousands of innocents since 2000, seized vast amounts of land, displaced the native residents, and have a system controlling Arabs who live in their conquered territory. They are not moral.
Check out reviewmeta. It lets you check the Amazon reported rating vs the actual rating.

Everyone has a right to criticize, but the author of the article is pointing out the hypocrisy of the US criticism, something everyone should be made aware of.
Nope, they can't discriminate based on what you believe, but what you do when you are being paid by them is completely different. If they told you to do something while you're on the clock and you don't do it, they're completely within their rights to fire you. And that's not even counting "Right to work" states, which don't even need a reason to fire you.

Yeah the contract was for $60000 a year + relocation, anti-malware research in an expensive place to live. It was a great internship and I was really lucky to get it! I thought that paying it outright would be the right thing to do, but just wanted to confirm. 
I've seen Billy Madison and it just didn't click with me. I like some stupid humor movies like Ace Ventura, but it just felt so gratingly stupid and juvenile. I know some like it but it got on my nerves.
Uh there is no her money and his money. They're married, anything given to one is given to both. She has been hiding money from her husband, who is already financially supporting her completely.
It is 100% psychological. You need willpower to lose weight, and she clearly doesn't have the willpower.
That's what the Justice Department said at the time. ABC is reporting that he did.

Unfortunately since they are out of print, flippers put insane markups on them. Your best bet is to check your local library and see if they have it, or if another library will loan it to them to loan it to you. Then you can just take it home and rip it yourself.
He tried being supportive, for five years. Now everyone is telling him to drop the issue and just accept that the person he married is going to be very different than she was when he married her. If he can't accept that her weight may never change, and will likely keep increasing, he should leave her. Easier for him, easier for her since she doesn't have to be with someone who values her being healthy and attractive.
There is no separate wedding for gays... What, do they need to bring out the gay flowers, the gay champagne, and the gay benches? Its the exact same wedding, except there will be two men or two women.
Break up with her, unacceptable double standard. Imagine if you started doing porn, told your girlfriend, but then tried to forbid her from watching it.

Red Oxx, they make awesome luggage and bags. Forever warranty against anything. They literally mention passing the bag down to your kids in your inheritance.
My advice is to never make big (or even medium) purchases from friends or family. They create a lot of resentment because it's rare that these purchases go perfectly. Maybe you buy the fit, it works well for a month or two, and then a non-powertrain issue crops up, or you find out the maintenance wasn't ever done, or really anything that you didn't notice beforehand. You can't take it to the dealer and say fix it, you aren't protected by lemon laws, and it might cause issues with your friendship if you feel like he took you for a ride. Just something to think about. 
Yeah sorry, been reading too many Aleppo threads today.

Nope it's not, and even if it was, focus your blame on the content providers who require obscene and draconian DRM that Intel has to design special chips for.

Lots of people in my life, especially my girlfriend, wonder how I'm able to stay so calm with the day to day turbulence of life. As best I can explain it, I trust myself enough to know I will make the right decisions and control the things I have control over, and the inner strength to not fret over the things I can't control. The important part is being able to tell which is which.
In what fucking profession are you doing an 80 hr/week unpaid internship? Cut that down to 40 hrs, 50 at the absolute maximum.

If your parents are divorced and your mom is paying for your brother's college, you probably are due child support after you turn 18. Unfortunately the money goes directly to the parent you live with before then. Ask your dad about it and do some research online to find out what forms you need to file to get it transferred to you when you turn 18. Your mom should be paying her fair share to support you.
And I'm 100% sure that all of these savings will be passed back on to the consumers, instead of pocketed by the for-profit utility. Oh wait, this is America...

She's already shown that she doesn't have the self control to manage her diet, so what makes you think she'll control herself in the future? And furthermore, since she's reacted so poorly to his (very reasonable) suggestions in the past, what makes you think she would react well to a suggestion to see a therapist?
Both of those are much steeper than whistler bowl so I would be cautious. Having skied both CE and all the Spanky's runs, I'd say the next easiest route would be Garnet Bowl to Lower Ruby. My main reason is that the entrance to CE, Sapphire, and Upper Ruby can be tricky, depending on conditions, plus Diamond is one of, if not the steepest run on Blackcomb.
That's also a motto common with Hikers. I remember my dad saying it when we would go backpacking.

OK I'll lay it out nice and simple for you:\n\n* NETFLIX - Has content deals with movie/tv companies that mandate a certain level of DRM. \n\n* 4k Video Playback - As served by NETFLIX, 4k video is in [10 bit HEVC](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/11/netflix-4k-streaming-pc-kaby-lake-cpu-windows-10-edge-browser/).\n\n* 10 Bit HEVC - [A new video codec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) that needs a special processor to decode at a HW level.\n\n* INTEL - Makes new chips that support decoding HEVC at a hardware level, starting with Kaby Lake.\n\n* Microsoft - Built support for the DRM into Windows 10.\n\n*HOW IT ALL TIES TOGETHER - The video format and DRM that NETFLIX uses needs a special chip that Intel has built on new CPUs, starting with Kaby Lake. Get your fucking your Intel hate boner out of your ass and start hating on Netflix, as they're the one's causing this issue.
Yeah lets just kill the average guy who works for shit wages there because I don't feel like I should be in jail.
In my other comments I've suggested that he leave her, as her behaviour is unlikely to change.
Yeah, I'm sure during the Civil Rights movement your solution would've been for those troublesome negroes to just use the damn separate facilities. Trying to do something in order to bring an end to discrimination is just "retaliating against those that oppose you".
Honestly the best way for us to obstruct Trump and the conservatives is to constantly sue them and require the courts support our rights. The best way of doing this is to keep donating to good charities willing to sue; eg ACLU, EFF, etc.
I wonder why? Oh yeah because we were stuck while waiting for the retarded conservatives on the SC to die off. We got rid of one, hopefully more soon.

I mentioned it in another comment here, but they also have the second highest suicide rate in the world, at a staggeringly high 28.9 per 100k.

Its not going anywhere. \n\n\nThe part being changed here is where getting someone to help you manage disability/social security benefits and finances makes you automatically considered mentally ill and dangerous. \n\n\n[The ACLU](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLU.pdf) also happens to want this section gone, and its pretty rare that they take any sort of pro stance on gun stuff unless its also violating the other amendments with issues on due process, etc. \n\n\n\nIts been explained better by other people in the 30 other posts about this law in the past day or two. 
>Why the hell should I consider racists, xenophobes, transphobes and homophobes as my equals?\n\nWhy should you blanket consider all rural people to fit that preconceived mold? They don't. If a rural person said that all city people were gay Jewish abortionists that would be wrong too. \n\n>Politics aside: cool username. I think there used to be a disabled one of those big bastard guns in a park in the tiny rural town I came from.\n\nHeh,  didn't even realize the howitzer connection, it's the name of an ultra high gain distortion pedal I use sometimes. Overkill for just about every situation,  but cool name regardless. \n

\n> Every idiot can google and find out that 'assault weapons' cause about 2% of gun deaths in america. \n\nIts a lot less than that actually. That 2% is from the roughly 250 rifle murders per year,  it refers to *all* rifles(from 22s to AKs to elephant guns)  of which stuff like ar15s makes up a much smaller subset\n\n
I love how extremely bent out of shape they get at the slightest hint of someone disagreeing with anything they say.
> DeWalt is just a yellow black and decker.\n\nThe same company owns them, but they arent the same product. Try dropping a black and decker drill(most of which look and feel like super soaker level quality plastic) and a dewalt from the same height off a ladder.\n\nMore of an older makita guy myself, but the dewalts still hold up decently well in an industrial setting. Gather they arent as good as they used to be, but still miles above black and decker and Skil brand garbage.
Your comment has literally nothing to do with mine. What a truly pathetic response.
So are you saying that every old guy in europe who has his son or someone else do his taxes/benefits paperwork for him has had their license revoked and guns confiscated?\n\nBecause thats not how it works here in canada either. Lots of senior citizens or disabled people dont handle their own finances. Hell, lots of healthy people dont either.
So the 40 that supported it, and other prominent politicians(like the president) that were in support, *werent* saying "why dont we ban these guns?" when they proposed, fought for and/or voted for a law that aimed to do just that?\n\nThats like saying the GOP isnt trying to repeal the ACA just because they havent succeeded yet.
The stupidest thing is that 99% of all firearms ever made effectively have barrel shrouds. All that is is a part of the firearm that "shrouds" part of the barrel, allowing the user to hold it without directly holding onto the barrel(which would affect accuracy, and also get too hold to hold very quickly.\n\nFor instance, this old [lever action hunting rifle](http://www.browning.com/content/dam/browning/product/firearms/rifles/blr/Browning-BLR-Lightweight-with-Pistol-Grip-034009-693.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.835.835.jpeg) has a wooden forestock, which is effectivelly doing the exact same thing as a "barrel shroud", in providing somewhere to grab the rifle that doesnt get hot.\n\nApparently grabbing a piece of black plastic or aluminum is much more dangerous than a piece of wood.\n\nClearly then, if you made an [AR15](http://cdn.net.outdoorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/outdoorhub-pictures-of-great-looking-wooden-furniture-for-ars-2016-02-03_21-31-02-800x507.jpg) with wooden furniture, that would be perfectly fine, right?

> Step outside of those shoes that make you orgasm at the site of chrome barrels and black stocks for a second\n\nSounds like a pretty [common rifle configuration to me](https://www.gunsamerica.com/UserImages/109943/948918146/wm_2160670.jpg)\n\nWood is expensive, heavy and warps/cracks in bad weather. With modern manufacturing methods, synthetic stocks are just becoming more common for everything. Everything else is more of a aesthetic or ergonomic concern.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having the generic looking rifle I posted above. What might surprise you though is that the same gun is basically the exact same kind of gun as an ar15. Takes the same size magazines, same semi auto action and fire rate, same caliber, similar overall size and accuracy.\n\nYou could put a different stock on the same [rifle](http://s1094.photobucket.com/user/rellikmok/media/mini14ebr006.jpg.html) and it might look scarier/cooler to some but its still the same rifle.\n\nI would imagine a hundred plus years ago people like you would be yelling at those kids for having the same sort of fancy bolt and lever actions that the military guys use, why cant they be happy with grandpa's falling block rifle.
I'm really not a fan of her proposed ideas for gun laws, but otherwise don't have much trouble with her at all. Not much more so than the average presidential candidate. I typically support the democrat politicians over the republicans.

How many social security benefit receivers who get someone else to manage their finances,  have gone out and started shooting people? \n\nBecause that is all that this bill is about. People deemed mentally ill are still going to be banned from gun ownership. 
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/27/do-it-yourself-background-checks/2088479/\n\n"Gun control advocates are more skeptical of Coburn's plan, and Coburn himself admitted he doesn't know whether it has the votes to pass, but it appears his plan will get a vote: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., promised as much last week as he pulled the gun bill from the floor, saying he would bring it up again later. "\n\nFrom what I can tell, that never happened, and it was never brought back for a vote. \n\n

One of them murdering ex members while the other doesnt, seems to be a pretty big difference to me. 
http://www.sprc.org/scope/age\n\nLike you said, homicide and suicide are big factors in early death, though even in the USA suicide is still the larger factor. In most other countries it wouldnt even be close.\n\nGiven that, and that unfailingly suicide accounts for many times the overall homicide numbers, I thought it was weird that homicide was the cause mentioned, but suicide wasnt. Especially when it is such a comparatively huge problem for many of the top countries listed like South Korea and Japan. 
Sorry, I put a little "/s" at the bottom of that post to show I was being sarcastic.\n\nWhat I wrote is a common response by people/journalists/politicians looking to do away with other amendments(most vocally the 2nd, is where that language is used). Just a jab at the "assured that with the first amendment" part, not such a sure thing.

Good. Cause something about his face/nose to hand proportion was genuinely shocking.
> Why is that so far out of line with GVA/GrC/ShootingTracker data, which has a only slightly expanded definition (4 vs. 3, roughly).\n\nSlightly apparently now means several-10 times higher numbers than other definitions. They also changed it from deaths to injuries, and in some cases not all recorded injuries were due to gun fire. ie, guy shoots at bus, 4 are injured when bus stops, none are hit by bullets, mass shooting
Is this story, with misleading headline and all going to just keep being reposted every couple of minutes then?\n\nIts already been posted in /r/politics dozens of times in the last day.

You can own all sorts of vehicles from dirtbikes and ATV's to cars and trucks, to drag racing cars, racebikes and tractors, etc on private land without them needing to be registered or have any sort of licensing for them.
Martin had every opportunity to not get shot, by simply deciding not to walk back out of his house intentionally looking for a confrontation and trying to beat a man to death.
So is this you admitting that there is a strong similarity between voter ID and it's implications(which I presumed you don't support)  and the new gun laws(which it seems you do support)? 
> "A barrel shroud is a covering attached to the barrel of a firearm, that partially or completely encircles the barrel which prevents operators from injuring themselves on a hot barrel."\n\nThat is exactly what a forestock on a rifle is. There is literally no functional difference.\n\nThe forward part of a rifle stock is 100% a barrel shroud. It is there to shroud the barrel and give the user something to hold onto.\n\nIs there any difference between the foregrips on these two rifles? [lee enfield](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/bf/37/13/bf3713cf8cc6418f1d0ddbd76a5c1257.jpg), and an [AR15 with a wood shroud](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2c/6d/83/2c6d8332850b8dd737957ce96489c3c4.jpg) for comparison?\n\nThe only functional difference between what you would call a barrel shroud and a forestock is what material they seem to be made of.\n\n> More like 10-12" AFAIK Not all collapsing stocks are the same.\n\nNot on most adjustable stocks, unless you are referring to folding stocks(which in general doesnt exist on an AR15, as the gun wont function without the buffer tube in place).\n\nGuns are still bound by barrel length requirements, and there is nothing illegal about having a rifle or shotgun with the buttstock removed(which would make it more compact than a folding stock could)

I would agree with that as a large factor. \n\nAlso, Much of American violence is related to prohibition. First of alcohol,  which brought organized crime and high violence to the USA,  and continued in the war on drugs.  A huge portion of shootings is gang members/criminals killing each other,  and there is just no where near the same level of criminal activity like that in Canada to compare. \n\nStill,  both countries(and most first world countries) have been trending down for violence at similar rates in the past few decades.

All of your examples are of gunfire injuries. If someone shoots one shot at one person, and 4 other people hurt themselves running away,  that isn't a mass shooting. Or at least it shouldn't be.

You certainly can. I just legally sold a truck to a guy who isnt going to be registering it or insuring it, because he is going to be using it on private property, as a farm truck.\n\nAll sorts of other vehicles like dirtbikes, ATV's, go karts, dune buggy's, dedicated 4x4's, track racing sportbikes, drag racing cars, tractors and other heavy machinery is bought and sold for use on private property without needing licenses, registration or insurance.
Does the homicide rate actually figure into these numbers in a statistically significant way?\n\nThe USA had 2,626,418 deaths in 2014, and 14,249 homicides. If the USA's total homicides were cut to match canada's rate (roughly 3.1 times less, a difference between 4.5 per 100k in USA and 1.45per100k in canada) it would have been 4596. The difference to the overall death rate for that year would have been 0.36%, which imo is fairly small on the grand scale of things.\n\nEspecially when the differences in suicide rate between the USA(12.1 per 100k) and a few other countries on the list are just as, or potentially more significant to total death numbers. For instance, with South Korea being the most improved in the linked article, it has a homicide rate of of 0.7 per 100k, which is very very low. However, its suicide rate is astronomically high at 28.9 per 100k, 2nd highest in the world.\n\nNow, if you were to give the USA the same rates, there would be 12k less homicides, but also an additional 59.4k suicides. On balance, the additional 47.4k deaths per year would be a change of 1.8% more deaths in 2014.\n\nSame goes in the opposite way with the countries with significantly lower suicide rates, there is a lot of variance in suicide rates and it is typically affecting numbers much larger than homicide rates in any given country. In most countries it is a very significant cause of death, especially in younger people( [2nd highest cause of death for 10-34yr olds in USA](http://www.sprc.org/scope/age) ) which would greatly affect overall lifespan averages.\n\nSince suicides account for 3 times as many deaths as homicides in the USA, and suicide rates are slowly trending up while homicide rates are trending down, that seems like it would be a point of interest in studies about increasing lifespan but it wasnt mentioned in the article.\n
> Feel free to punch\n\nNope,  that's already a crime. 
I edited some of that in, and put it in replies to other people. \n\nGoing by age distribution http://www.sprc.org/scope/age, I answered my earlier question, that yes homicide is significant, but still supports my line of questioning about suicide not being mentioned, as even in the USA suicide is the higher cause of death for younger people, and overall responsible for 3 times the number.\n\nIn many other countries in the comparison it wouldnt even be close, suicide is still one of the top causes of death for younger people(with homicide not as high), and in many of the other examples i looked at, also responsible for between 10 and 60 times the overall deaths as homicides.\n\nWith it being a comparatively larger problem, especially in some of the countries listed like japan and south korea, I was expecting to see some of the article focusing on its effects.
Bet you wish there was a few on your side.
This dude leveled Dex.
>  More than 16000 homicide deaths in the US in 2010 [...] Add the > 31000 firearm deaths (86 per day!), which is rather unique for high-income countries\n\nThat is a bit misleading.\n\n1) the 31000 firearm deaths is already including roughly 9k of the 15k total homicides, so no need to add them together. Leaving 22k out of 31k firearms deaths being suicide and 500 being accident\n\n2) more importantly, while the 22,000 suicides by firearm is an unusually high number even when translated to per capita basis, the USA's total suicide rate(12.6per100k) is in no way unusual, unique or high for developed countries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate\n\nSo while the tool used for suicides in the USA is unusual, the total outcome isnt, so in that regard most(2/3) of the 31,000 firearms deaths arent really driving overall death rates in any significant way compared to many other countries.\n\nHomicide wise, yes, but for suicide the USA is pretty middle of the road.\n\nI did another comment elsewhere in this thread on why suicide is really the bigger factor of the two in lifespan, internationally and in the USA\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5vg0vn/life_expectancy_will_soon_exceed_90_years_for_the/de22047/ 
Worldwide elephants account for 500 or so deaths per year. [1](http://www.animaldanger.com/most-dangerous-animals.php)\n\nIn the States, motor vehicle accidents kill roughly 30,000 people a year, and people 75 and older make up a pretty decent amount, and [growing](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-05-02-older-drivers-usat1a_n.htm).\n\nJust saying, people take vehicle accidents for granted, but they do account for a pretty significant amount of deaths.
Its a step in the right direction to automatically consider anyone receiving SS/disability benefits and getting someone else to manage their finances to be dangerously mentally ill? The ACLU disagrees.
Plenty of canadians have these sorts of rifles, and do hunt with them, if that makes any difference to you.\n\nI would have to ask why canada had still the same fraction of the USA's homicide rate in the years before canada enacted stricter gun laws, back when it was legal to mail order a full auto AK47 or FAL without a permit and have it shipped to your door. The new gun laws werent really what made canada safe, it was before, and continued along the same trend relatively unchanged as new gun laws were added and occasionally removed.
Aww too bad. What sort of injuries? Im playing a guitar that was designed by a guy with carpal tunnel/wrist issues(though i got it for other reasons) but people I know with wrist injuries have said they find them easier to deal with \nhttps://www.ormsbyguitars.com/what-is-a-multiscale.html\n\nIve only tried a little bit of classical stuff on guitar, I can do a pretty good Rondo Alla Turca/Mozart and am working on a Paganini tune. Much more of a metal type player in general but the classical stuff plays similarly.
> yeah, it makes sense - the Canadians have a less fearful, desperate and insecure society, because they have a more robust safety net to protect and support people. Not only that, they do not shame those who need help, but support them. there is a greater sense of community.\n\nYup, people who dont have their backs against the wall dont tend to turn to a life of crime to pay bills.\n\nThat is a major problem in the USA, and healthcare is what I see as the most glaring difference. \n\n> ok. but ties into the bigger question - why don't Canadians have the same gang problem? what is different about the US and Canada?\n\nWell, to start, canada didnt try banning alcohol, leading to incredibly lucrative smuggling and illegal manufacturing to be in high nationwide demand, which basically was the fuel organized crime needed to become a massive force in the USA. Violence skyrocketed as a result. The War on Drugs, and the USA as a huge market for stuff like the cocaine trade also kept this trend alive.\n\nCanada is a much smaller pond for big fish to really be interested in.\n\nAlso, racial and class based segregation(immigrants, poor people, blacks, etc) being basically forced into smaller parts of the cities, where education suffers, law enforcement is non existent or actually harmful, and poor people are essentially trapped leads to people choosing criminal, and thus dangerous, means of supporting themselves.\n\nAn easy way to tell that the USA is just a plain more violent society than canada, even if every gun were to vanish overnight in the USA, is that the USA's non firearm homicide alone(which is a relatively small portion of homicide) is higher than Canada's total homicide including firearms. And its not like we dont have access to guns up here, there are upwards of 1 gun per three people in the legal supply and plenty more smuggled in from USA and in shipping containers elsewhere.\n\nAnd, thats in an ideal scenario where once all the guns south of the border vanish, not a single potential firearms homicide is committed with a different weapon. In reality, even if guns magically disappeared, a good portion of those murders would still happen without them, so the USA would still far exceed Canada for homicide.
Yup,  have for quite a while,  mostly on 7 strings now. Don't really have any remotely recent recordings though, but I'll look in my comp next time I'm home and see what I can dig up.  Been meaning to start recording and doing videos again for a while though. \n\nHow about you?

While its true that suicides tend to be a bit more frequent in older people, they still affect a very large number of the younger population. http://www.sprc.org/scope/age\n\nThey are typically in the top 5 causes of death for younger people(ie, while more seniors kill themselves, they are also dying much more from other causes by that time). Sadly, a lot of young people commit suicide.\n\nIn that link above, they are listed as the 2nd most common cause of death for 10-34 yr olds, and 4th for 35-54yrs, beating homicide in all age ranges(though homicide is close behind for younger people, as you said, homicide is typically young people killing each other.)\n\nGoing by huge gap between suicide(high) and homicide(low) rates in most developed countries, suicide has to be the bigger driving factor.\n\nAs i mentioned above, the USA is one of the few where they are somewhat close together(due to a higher homicide rate and a relatively average suicide rate) and its still 3 to 1. In a lot of other developed countries its more like 10 to 1 or higher
>is it automatic?\n\nNo\n>is it a hunting rifle? \n\nYes. \n\n> what was it made for?  \n\nThe Armalite ar10 was originally made for civilians and marketed as a sporting(target shooting and hunting)  rifle very early on. \n\nMost "traditional hunting rifles" in use are originally military designs,  so it's a pretty weak distinction. \n
What exactly do you think is wrong with allowing *nonviolent felons* to have 2nd amendment rights again on a case by case review basis?

And thats what you think the difference is? Thats it? 
> And what are your views on drunk driving laws? \n\nThat if they were applied in the same way to guns, you would be removing gun laws not adding them.\n\nDrunk driving is a dangerous behavior that is illegal. Similarly, dangerous behavior with a gun is also illegal(like carrying a gun while drunk for the closest example, but also shooting targets in urban areas, firing in the air, that sort of thing.)\n\nDrunk driving isnt combated by banning certain items, or else cars and liquor bottles would be banned.\n\nAs soon as anti drunk driving legislation makes a hard 180 degree turn and goes back to pushing for prohibition of alcohol, then the comparison to banning guns or types of guns can be made.
Probably because of all your posts about gun rights for them to respond to.
> The barrel shroud is to protect you from getting burned after firing your gun a lot, which is arguably a feature geared more towards mass shootings or military applications.\n\nDude, practically every gun ever made has a barrel shroud.\n\nFor instance, this old [lever action hunting rifle](http://www.browning.com/content/dam/browning/product/firearms/rifles/blr/Browning-BLR-Lightweight-with-Pistol-Grip-034009-693.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.835.835.jpeg) has a wooden forestock, which is effectively doing the exact same thing as a "barrel shroud", in providing somewhere to grab the rifle that doesnt get hot.\n\nApparently grabbing a piece of black plastic or aluminum is much more dangerous than a piece of wood.\n\nClearly then, if you made an [AR15](http://cdn.net.outdoorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/outdoorhub-pictures-of-great-looking-wooden-furniture-for-ars-2016-02-03_21-31-02-800x507.jpg) with wooden furniture, that would be perfectly fine, right? Because if its wood, its no longer a barrel shroud?\n\nDoes this mean black synthetic stocked hunting rifles should be banned for having barrel shrouds?\n\n\n> Not an adjustable stock, a collapsible stock...very important for concealing a rifle.\n\nRight, making a 3 ft long rifle 4-5 inches shorter is crucial for concealment. Personally i find it much more useful for ergonomic adjustment especially when my foot shorter wife uses mine.
People deemed mentally ill are still banned from gun ownership in the USA. This does not change that. 
> Here's a thought: what if the school shooter was part of the faculty?\n\nOk, now lets imagine this crazed faculty member in literally any other school that doesnt allow permitted people to carry concealed firearms.\n\nThey wake up in the morning, think "yup todays the day" and put the same gun in their pocket/bag and walk right through the doors, past the "no guns" sign and start shooting.\n\nDid anything change to make it more or less easy for them? Nope. Except that you can guarantee there wouldnt be any well meaning staff there with any means to shoot back.

Yet you are far more likely to lose your life to one of the guys buying the car when they shouldnt.
The title of this article and the 30 plus other ones posted in the last few days(not to mention the vast majority of initial commenters, posting in response to the title) make it abundantly clear that the message getting across to people is that "mentally ill people can now buy guns". Which is absolutely not true, and would in fact be a huge change affecting long established law if it was actually happening.\n\nThe reality is this is a considerably smaller change, rolling back a new law only recently implemented. It is about the change where they added anyone who was getting their disability benefits handled by someone else automatically to the list of dangerously mentally ill people that are prohibited from gun ownership. This expansion has the effect of taking gun rights away from people who have not been deemed mentally unfit for gun ownership by a proper court of law or any medical professionals. It quite simply is an overreach, and repealing it is if nothing else a fairly minor change to rules that hardly even exist yet.\n\n[ACLU](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLU.pdf) explain it better than me.\n\n
It would be sweet if that was true, but it isnt.
But they havent succeeded, therefore they arent trying! It is actually the same, and their tactics are very similar. Neither stand much of a chance of outright getting what they want, and settle for chipping away at the edges. Thats why when they cant ban abortion, they can just require that the buildings it is done in follow ridiculous standards that none of the current clinics meet.\n\nSimilar has been done in cities like [San Francisco](http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/San-Francisco-s-last-gun-shop-gives-up-the-fight-6601929.php) and chicago, by forcing all the stores out, making the permitting process extremely difficult or allowing cops to deny a application that meets all standards for no reason(may issue permitting). There are countless examples of this.\n\nYes, comparatively few Democrats will come out and say they want to ban and confiscate guns, but that doesnt mean that isnt effectively what is being tried, piece by piece. Banning the most popular rifles in the USA is a plank in their official platform. Or, as another example, the politicians who dont want to "take guns" say America should follow the Australian model, famous for being a system of widespread banning and forced confiscation.\n\nIt would be like a Republican saying "america should follow Ireland's example with abortion" and then apologists trying to claim that statement is anything other than advocating for banning abortion.
>  I'm in Alabama so I can't transfer a handgun across state lines.\n\nAnd yet so many people think that you can do exactly that[cross state border to buy a gun in a laxer state]. Presumably because they have never tried.
Ah ha ha ha oh man that's a good one.
I mean, you havent even tried to dispute anything Ive actually said.\n\nAnd yes, plenty of target shooting and small game guns(like the most widely owned .22lr rifles around the world, such as the remington 597 or ruger 10-22) have mags that size. Doesnt stop them from being a gun meant to shoot squirrels and cans with.
Everything I've ever heard about them has been negative. Worse than makita, milwaukee, dewalt, rigid even.\n\nNow thats just hearsay, but from handling some of their stuff, looking at the pricepoint, i dont think they are made to hold up in a professional or heavy use setting. Im sure they would be quite enough for household use, but I wouldnt be spending money on them if i was taking them to work.
Not only does the bill not make sense(by primarily going after arbitrary cosmetic features on guns that are statistically never involved in crime, despite their high levels of ownership. Guns that are available elsewhere(good luck slam dunking a bill that bans americans from owning guns that canadians have in spades)), but it has already been tried back in 1994, and found to have been pretty useless. \n\nIts hard enough to push a bill where it is barely theoretically capable of doing anything when there is already public record and data of a previous version of it being just as pointless as the detractors always said it would be.
So you are an idiot then? \n\nHow would Budweiser be criminally responsible for a drunk driver? Why not sue Ford? Or Shell,  for selling him the gasoline? 
They all look like rifles to me.
So you trust the NCVS DGU numbers? 
If you feel that the UK's current stats on homicide means that "you got it right", then you should be perfectly happy to repeal the 1997 handgun ban, given that the homicide rate was just as low before it was put in place. [graph](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2SW2_lbrxgY/TSx_HwmwClI/AAAAAAAABaQ/SqgzulUPCwo/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2010-12-01%2Bat%2B%2BWednesday%252C%2BDecember%2B1%252C%2B3.10%2BPM.png)\n\nGiven the UK has had consistently low homicides for decades long predating any of the modern gun control laws, it seems illogical to give all the credit to 1990s era laws for a country thats been relatively safe for most of the preceding century.
People deemed mentally ill are still not allowed to have guns.\n\nThe only change here is that receiving benefits and having someone else deal  with the finances for you is no longer enough to automatically have you considered dangerously mentally ill. ie, Grandpa has his son deal with taxes, benefits paperwork for him.
Yeah, its the middle aged conservative voting NRA members that are responsible for all the homicides in the USA.\n\nDarn those rural maniacs, running around killing each other over drugs and street corners with their 2 thousand dollar 3ft long rifles tucked in their pants.
So, who's America was it for [the OSU attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ohio_State_University_attack) last month?
Is it just me, or are his hands much larger than you would think?
Lots of people dont manage their own finances.\n\nFor instance, i know tons of older couples where one of them takes care of the finances of the family and the other stays out of it entirely. Or older people, hard of hearing, whatever who get their children to deal with the govt. bureaucracy for benefits and all that sort of thing. Its extremely common, but doesnt say anything on its own about that person.\n\nMy grandpa not wanting to deal with taxes etc anymore, and letting my mum deal with it wouldnt have meant he is incapable of going hunting in deer season.
You mean the document written by slave owners? Why should a 200 year old piece of parchment hold any sway in a modern society the framers couldnt have possibly envisioned?\n\n\n^^^^^/s
Did you forget what comment thread you are in? About Reid killing the Coburn Bill to expand background checks?\n\n
>Extreme vetting for all brown, non-Christians but no vetting for guns. This makes sense.  \n\nThere is plenty of vetting on guns. This changes almost none of it,  they are just saying that people who receive social security benefits and get someone to manage their finances for them shouldnt be automatically considered dangerously mentally ill. \n\nPeople who have actually been deemed mentally ill are still banned from gun ownership. \n   
I dont. Are you a bot, or just a massive idiot?
You know there is basically no reason you should,  right? \n\nThe guns being targeted are not any more dangerous than other guns, and account for a statistically insignificant amount of violence,  despite being one of the most widely owned types of rifles in the country. \n\nAlso, its been well proven that the previous AWB had no positive effect on crime,  and was basically incapable of doing so,  even theoretically. 
Well now it makes sense why they don't let Brits own guns.
Is [1779](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_air_rifle) close enough for a 21 rd mag?
If kawasaki ninjas were banned, but I could still buy a honda CBR, I would be complaining about it being logically inconsistent. And perhaps I just prefer the look/seating position of one over the other.
According to the ATF(and any other gun control legislation in any country Ive ever heard of), a 2 or 3 round burst still counts as a form of full auto.
I never thought Noctis was charming. He's just some dumb awkward brat with a destiny a lot bigger than he is, that he really doesn't want, who'd be lost without his friends. He's really kind of normal, and I guess that's where the character's charm lies. I think, of all the Final Fantasy protagonists you're most likely to run into someone with a personality like Noctis's.\n\nVersus XIII Noctis was being set up to be the same dull dark and edgy boring protagonist Lightning was. 
Opinions are not more relevant than facts.
Soooo glad they scrapped this edgelord concept.\n\nIt's kind of annoying how it's become everyone's perfect game even though it literally never existed, though. 
Your child's future teachers will know he's "on the spectrum" yes?\n\nThink about all the frustrated, angry children "on the spectrum" without being diagnosed who are throwing tantrums, distracting and hurting other children and not learning in school because their parents don't understand the signs and are not getting the help their children need.\n\nThis will benefit them.
I'll check it out if I ever need to purge after a meal.
I mean, people are allowed to change their minds, especially when they receive criticism. You *should* change your mind when you're confronted with evidence that you are wrong. Credit where credit is due *if* he's truly changed perspective.\n\nThing is, and maybe this is just his innate smug self-righteousness coming through, this seems very disingenuous. He's saying he's wrong for what he said, while blaming everyone who criticized him for taking his remarks seriously in the context that he said them. 
All  Mexico has to do to beat out the US's life expectancy is have more accessible healthcare. The US doesn't do too well in that department right now, especially considering our rising costs and the poverty rate. \n\nI don't know the status of Mexican healthcare now, or where either country will be in 30 years, but it's possible just considering obesity rates. 
Yep, patting these guys on the back for this is essentially patting them on the back for saving their own asses.
If you don't already know how to cook, learn it. Don't just live off fast food and take outs, that's how you rack up debt and get fat fast. Get a slow cooker or preferably a pressure cooker, they're both great for making big meals and portioning out the rest.\n\nCoupons are awesome, but don't buy shit just because you have a coupon for it. Learn how to shop, save yourself money. It's expensive out there.\n\nLock your door behind you.\n\nBe careful who you invite around and who you allow them to bring along. When you live alone your shit is a lot easier to steal. Don't post about your comings and goings on social media. Vacation and night out posts should be left for your return. 
So why do you oppose UBI?
Lol are you fucking serious right now? You do realize these "simple joys" would amount to this child spending days in the hospital when he's already spent so much of his short life in one? \n\nIs that how you would want to spend the last of your life? *Cheetos and Pepsi* are you for real? This is your great sacrifice? What is wrong with you? Re-examine your goddamn priorities if you think junk food is this necessary of a life experience.
ITT: Bad parents angry that someone might make them face consequences for trying to shove the results of their bad parenting off on other people. 
Why does it seem like he's saying he's wrong, while also saying it's everyone else's fault for it? I'd hope this would make him face whatever's broken inside of him that makes him such a horrible, hateful human being, but it seems that might be a bit much to expect. 
Apparently WW2 never happened and the allies calmly talked the Nazis into *not* killing millions of people. 
B-but gamergate bruh
Because they're not obligated to sell his shit. He can say what he wants.
So you *do* think that a business is obligated to provide audience.
They'd initially said they were splitting it to not leave anything out, but it seems they're walking back on this. But if they truly decided to "not leave anything out" they could easily wring enough material for 3 full 50+ hour games from the original.\n\nI'm sorry you want to bankrupt Square Enix to get a modern quality game with all the content of a PS1 era game for the same price as a PS1 era game, but it's not happening. If you don't want to buy it, stick with one of the ten thousand ports. 
Better than calling it breakfast I guess.
But it's not like they can't subpoena a post's information, right? I think that's people on reddit being a little overconfident. 
It's really hard to have empathy for someone who goes out of his way to attack and hurt people as much as this man does. \n\nIt would be one thing if he kept his actions isolated to politics, but he has a habit of personally attacking people who stand up to him. That's disgusting and there's no excuse for it. This isn't politics.
A couple of very important factors.\n\nObesity, which is a massive problem in both countries, and healthcare accessibility, which is a massive problem in at least one of the two. 
I don't think the hiding actually does anything. I tried it and the MT just ripped poor Noct out of the hiding space. \n\nIt added to the effect though. I don't care what anyone else thinks, I enjoyed chapter 13.
Uneducated white people in the rust belt and Appalachia still hold onto the hope that their jorb will come back if only their water becomes more undrinkable. 
The problem is that the poor states think they're paying for everything when they're actually living on the dole. 
Good thing this isn't censorship.
If a child is repeatedly throwing tantrums, it's not just harming *their* education. It's harming the education of the other 20 to 30 children in the classroom. You can say that schools and social services are harming your child because they're questioning you as much as you want, but your child is not the only child in existence, nor the most important one. The school owes it to the other children and parents to figure out what is going on with the child who is being disruptive and maybe even violent toward their children.
Yeah, I was about the same age and did nearly the same thing (I think I was in the 50s). But I don't think you can compare a speed run from a 12 year old who doesn't understand the game to well, anything. Every game is harder when you rush it and you don't understand it. 
AW HE DED\n\n...Oh, he got up. :)\n\nCan't imagine the concussion he must've had though.
They were a bit more developed than the rest, but omg if they weren't still some of the biggest anime cliches ever. 
I think UBI will depend on where you are in the world, TBH. A lot of Americans, even millennials, will hate that shit because they're so attached to the idea that if you're not working, you're not living. 
Oh wow, I forgot how every genocidal movement ever has been stopped by the power of positive thinking and setting a good example with our free speech.
Did he vote for them, though?\n\nBecause I keep hearing this from people, but when you ask them if they voted for them, they still did. \n\nI know it isn't true for everyone (plenty of McMuffins, Johnsons, non-voters, party-crossers, whatever) but a lot of people will curse congress and then go vote for incumbents, for example. It's a perfect example of talk is cheap. 
He's the oldest, but he's still only supposed to be a 23 year old guy and it really shows when shit gets serious. He's as in over his head as Noctis is and he loses it in a different way.
> (e.g. telling them that she's adamantly childfree and doesn't want children ever).\n\nYou mean telling your employer that you're a coldhearted, psychopathic shrew? A sexual deviant? A (insert any other way to say "waaaaaaat she doesn't want babies there's something wrong with herrrrr") like they always think? \n\nWhile being childfree is more common among millennials (and will likely be more common for Post-Millennials when more of them are of age) we're still a minority and we still fill a lot of older people with contempt and revulsion. 
Some of us are just like this. I wouldn't take offense if this is all you have that he's not happy with you. \n\nI pretty much never text anyone and calling is even rarer. I kind of get that some people can't handle it, but all the people I keep around understand. It doesn't mean I'm unhappy with anyone or I love them less, I just don't small talk. (I can actually be the opposite in relationships: "Ugh, I really like this guy but he like never.stops.talking...")\n\nBut if it's really important to you and you're really unhappy, you can love someone and be completely incompatible at the same time. It's hard and heartbreaking to come to that realization, but if you're not getting the communication you need, love isn't enough.
Stereotypes. Like full on. Do not go into this game expecting to be blown away by amazing story and characters, go into it for fun gameplay. 
Was your family actually under her "care" or were they just bystanders in awe of her "generosity"?\n\nBecause unless they were dying in cots of curable illness I don't think they're any better off than an American catholic saying she's a fucking saint, either. It's denying facts to put a happy face sticker on an ugly truth.
With my bills, I apply for charity and financial aid first. If that's a no go, I call them and I *tell them* what I will pay per month, and they will deal with it. \n\nFor the amount OP has though (basing off my own experiences, I'm guessing surgery with no insurance), I think if they aren't working with them to cut it down then OP should probably work on bankruptcy. 
Sounds like it would have a gritty mouthfeel, with the occasional bit of soggy cake that'd find just the right spot to trigger my gag reflex. \n\nGranted, even thinking about drinking this makes me want to gag a little so that spot would probably be my entire mouth. 
Constant right wing rhetoric about "tax and spend" liberals/democrats (despite facts saying they're just as bad or worse) and evil socialisms (despite not minding being the beneficiaries) and California being a failed state (despite being on its own one of the most successful economies in the world) etc etc etc. Seriously, just pay attention to right wing media long enough, you'll learn that "alternative facts" aren't exactly a new thing. \n\nYou can say that's just the media and the politicians, but the voters support it. 
God I fucking hate that place 
So are you honestly suggesting that it's better to stand by and let people be killed, tortured, enslaved, etc than to ever be violent?\n\nWhat a naive, privileged, shitty, cowardly worldview.
Do they follow the same creepy Christian cult, or is this just an attempt to sling mud at already dirty people for clicks?
Who has first hand experience? Because it's not the person you're defending. His father didn't either. They were people who sort of lived in the area, by this person's own admission.
Reddit really isn't heavy on the censorship though.
The precedent is all of Japanese law. It's really simple, stop being a brat.
I suppose I misunderstood your post as defensive in the chain- it came across (to me) as you saying that you wouldn't stand with specific groups because they're not standing for everyone when they stand up for themselves and you felt attacked for it. That logic does not compute, so I'm glad it's not the case.
I think there's good and bad in this trope. Yeah, the "now it's personal" hero is usually boring and can be kind of gross (ah, what's that? A writer using sexual violence against a woman to fuel his big, strong male protagonist into action? Quaint), but the "woah, wait a second, destiny can go fuck itself" hero is someone I always kind of enjoy. 
Look at this guy. He's so cool. 
If a child has a developmental disorder that is not being addressed, shouldn't someone be getting involved to find out *why*? School officials will know that if a child has a certain DD that he or she may be more prone to tantrums, no investigation necessary. So I could only see this being a problem if the disorder is going undiagnosed.\n\nI think people saying this is overreach are people who are more concerned with parents getting their way than children being safe.
I think UK has a lot of social programs for people like this. 
If a parent doesn't consent and the child is a persistent disruption and abusive to other children, I'm sure the school has other avenues to take. At the very least, social services is now involved in monitoring the unhealthy home situation.\n\n"He's my son I can raise him how I want." Exactly the problem you addressed in your post, despite a clear and obvious problem, and different types of abusive situations (refusing to get a developmental disability diagnosed and treated *is abuse*), so many people are more concerned with "parental choice" than a child's wellbeing. 
Don't absolve Republican voters of their share of the blame for the state of the country.\n\nRepublican politicians have no power without Republican voters.
I think Final Fantasy will have to try hard to top Cinque. All the characters in Type 0 are anime stereotypes with next to no development, and Cinque is the ditzy idiot girl character and she has more lines than like, half the cast because Japan has a fetish for ditzy idiot girl characters. 
>Reality\n\nThe fuck? Is that some place in Europe?
You don't even need knights of the round though? Once your characters are like level 60 they're fine. Get your yellow materia game on point and Sephiroth is a bitch.
She points at the toddler because "b-but I'm a mommy!" grants her instant vindication in the eyes of like 95% of the population. \n\n*She's* blaming her toddler because he's an easy scapegoat who can't fight back. For all we know, she could put the boy to bed at 7 and then have parties until 4 AM all through the workweek.
The gods are dicks.
He's always been human.\n\nNone of what you're saying excuses what he's done to people, sorry. 
"Just trolling" "just joking" "it's just a prank, bro"\n\nYeah, doesn't matter. Actions still have consequences. Deal with them. 
/r/news and /r/worldnews have had problems with being altright cesspools for a while. It gets even worse when one of their circlejerks is shut down. 
So where is all the Republican outrage? Is it so loud I have just gone deaf?
Oh, I know. \n\nBut somehow people have convinced themselves there's dignity in part timing for 8 bucks an hour at McDonalds just because it's work. Not because it's enriching or fulfilling, but because it's work. \n\nIt'll take a lot to break that kind of indoctrination.
I haven't played it. The only Parasite Eve game I played was the first one. \n\nI heard it made a lot of fans angry though (but I guess that would be because of the story more than the combat). 
Well, for example, when you say a war fought to free human beings from torture, slavery and death was unjust, I say you're naive, privileged and cowardly. I honestly do not think you understand just how awful things can be.\n\nI'd like you to tell me why you think otherwise.
You'd better do something to protect yourself from that edge first, bro.
Wasn't she in XIII for like 5 minutes, most of that flashbacks? 
Why should they say good things about him though? What praise has he actually earned?
She was flying around the world, being treated by various heads of state as she begged for donations that she said were being used for things they weren't being used for. Even if she lived in part time poverty that doesn't make up for the evil she did. She was a liar, a scammer, and a torturer. She was not a doctor.\n\nYou know who I'm cool with? Medecins sans Frontieres. The people who do the things Mother Theresa claimed she was doing.
Apparently never, since violence is always bad unless you're a Nazi. But like, who can actually really like, define a Nazi, anyway? \n\nThe Jews should have just showed them their freedoms and the Nazis would have been happy instead of genocidal. 
Okay? The cool thing about UBI is that it pays you enough to live off of so you can pursue what enriches and fulfills you. So yeah, if working the resort is your jam that's great, only now you don't have to worry about affording rent on a 9 dollar an hour seasonal wage while you contribute positively to society. 
A lot of people think these numbers are lies, or leftist propaganda, or they can be explained away by drug users and minorities not seeking treatment on purpose.\n\nI was trying to explain these to my right wing father recently, and he just wouldn't accept it. He literally thinks that the reason we have a higher maternal/infant death rate is because of druggies. \n\nFor the party of "personal responsibility" these people are really good at making up excuses for everything unflattering about Americans.
Porn isn't sex, it's acting. Sex-acting. \n\nSo yeah, it takes talent to make it actually look good, whatever the gender of the participants are, whatever hole it's going in.
I love the combat system. I hate just about everything else.\n\nNow that you mention it, a lot of Tabata's games are my favorites, combat wise. 
"Lol it's a joke" is not some magic phrase that undoes everything you choose to do. 
No, I'm not disappointed they scrapped Safay Roth and went with Ardyn instead.\n\nShit sounds lame af.
At least there seems to be a significant portion of comments on his page calling this story for the bullshit its peddling. It'll never be a majority since she's a mommy and that means she's free of all blame and perfect in every way, but there are a good number of people saying "there's something missing here."
On PS4 you could still play until you closed and installed. 
The alt right will keep mischaracterizing his actions as free speech and by extension the Republicans will keep defending him because Murica. 
It's quite easy to get several of the final weapons in X, including Auron's.\n\nWith Auron's final weapon, you can take the last actual boss fight down with two or three normal attacks, and this is with normal leveling. \n\nThe *final* final boss in X is impossible to lose, so I don't think it counts.
I wouldn't feel sorry for him if someone targeted by his bullshit punched him. \n\nIf he's this desperate for views maybe he needs a vacation.
What 2/3 majority?
Inciting harassment against people for being who they are? Posting pictures of people he didn't have permission to post because they dared disagree with him? \n
But as he was doing that, weren't they also drafting an executive order to take Indiana's LGBT discrimination law nationwide? 
Once again, the needs of one do not outweigh the needs of the many. If the child is being that extremely disruptive, it's not right to tell the rest of the families involved that they have to suck it up and deal with abuse and subpar education because of one child. If accommodations could be reasonably made, that's one thing. But if a child is being triggered by all kids with black hair, or boys, or a raised voice, or anything common in a classsroom, well... he or she should probably be withdrawn from classes until they have better coping mechanisms for the health and safety of *all* involved.\n\nIt's not just about one person here. 
If by "care for them" you mean "take donations from rich westerners under the guise of helping poor brown people and then letting the  sick suffer in squalor while feeding donations to church coffers because suffering brings you closer to Jesus and the Pope needs a new hat" sure. 
Well, one way or another someone's free speech is getting suppressed I guess.
If you really, honestly think this is true, I wish we could trade lives. I can't imagine having the kind of life where I could actually change my problems just by blaming myself, then just trying to change them.\n\nBecause, you know, no one has ever tried that before.
I didn't like 13 and I haven't played 13-2 or Lightning Returns because of that but spending more time around here kind of makes me want to try Lightning Returns. I see a lot of positive praise for the combat system and gameplay.\n\nMaybe if I can pick it up cheaply. 
Ah ha ha ha, doxxing and inciting harassment against people you don't like ah ha ha how comedic!
Do you honestly think they didn't try to solve slavery without war? The United States was already so far behind the rest of the western world on this matter... and you wish they would have waited longer? Why didn't the white people stand by and let black people be treated as property, beaten, raped, tortured and killed, all in the name of maintaining a facade of peace for a little bit longer and everything would have been okay?\n\nYes, they are not realistic to the point of being pure fantasy. So why are you condemning the actions of a world that does exist based on your idealized world that does not? It's one thing to say "it would be nice" or "I wish it were this way" but it's another thing entirely to say things are wrong because they don't work to your fantasies. 
In cases like this, where the damage is caused by a person, the person will be sued by the insurance company. The insurance company won't just quietly cover the expense.\n\nThis mombie and her shitty brat are going to be sued either way. And OP needs a no kids policy on his studio.
Crumbling infrastructure and 0 investment because muh taxes.
Fat and miserable is a bit closer, I think.
Lol\n\nTIL that reporting the news and telling the truth is "talking trash" and "talking shit."\n\nMan, you Trump fans are something else. You should be embarrassed by how gullible you are.
It sounds like this is just adding more situations for a school official to question as a mandated reporter. 
This guy looks smug. Like he thinks he's going to get away with it, like he's gotten away with bullying everyone else in his life.\n\nSad thing is, he might be right. 
Most of these towns already have drug problems.\n\nLook at a coal production map, then look at an opiates prescription map. West Virginia and Kentucky have a drug problem, and a coal problem.
this man was proven guilty of a similar such crime was he not?\n\nyet he was in fact innocent. but he was PROVEN guilty.
Someone posted this ring to this group. I replied that its a $1.39 ring on ebay and provided item numbers\n\nI can't find it anymore so I suspect they deleted the post.\n\nI got the ring in the mail.

yeah. the sniff test comes back horribly wrotten.\n\nno shit on sell and upsize. the size is not the issue (its a $200,000 house that the twnshp has decreed by fiat is worth $400,000 yeah right) and the millage rate in bristol twnshp is insanely high (1.8% my ass)\n\nthe core problem is I don't technically own it even though I paid for it. I am working on that. but I need time. he was a bit of a hoarder so its got a lot of shit in it that has to be cleaned out and I work 7 days a week. I actually have off today and will be spending most of the day cleaning out the damned garage.\n\nahh no. you don't seem to be all that aware of how taxes work.???\n\nI pay roughly 9 taxes and a refund only applies to PRECISELY ONE of them. One of the smallest Base Federal income tax.\n\nSS gets no refund. Medi gets no Refund. State gets no refund. local gets no refund county gets no refund property and school get no refund. at all. no matter how low my income (except state if you dip below $4500 a year)\n\nI don't earn enough to claim anything against my taxes and that would only apply to base federal and have zero impact on any of the others. my Mileage deduction wipes out most of the federal but I can't claim "full" mileage and the state won't let me claim ANY at all since I get paid "anything at all" for mileage (yeah really fucking sucks)\n\nI MIGHT get a slight brake this year since I am now head of household and charged with caring for my handicapped sister for the rest of my life now. but again. I don't earn enough for that to really help. it might wipe out the few percent in base federal income tax I might owe.\n\nits a pretty shitty unique situation that even with hindsight I am not sure if I could change in any meaningful way.\n\nI helped bail my father out of some financial troubles (NOT a bad father no drugs no abuse no alcohol no gambling just some failed businesses and serious health issues largely out of his control)\n\nI AM HOPING to now qualify for health care at the minimum since i don't have any health insurance and have some serious psycological issues I need to have addressed (very very overweight with no medical problems physically and plenty active so the constant hunger issues must be mental) Working on the weight slower. finally dipped to 440 pounds this week!! finally broke through 443 pounds been stuck there for quite some time I guess all this shit storm may have finally helped in some small way as I desperately need to get rid of the weight before it does in fact kill me)\n\nChildren do inherit their parents debt when its all in their name. or the state declares it so.\n\nI maxed out all my credit to catch my dad up on all his bills (to the tune of $18,000)\n\nthis was over 10 years ago. I have been working a second full time job just to pay the notes on those and am JUST NOW starting to get a handle on it (got more credit with 0% interest to help pay it down finally instead of just interest payments) but then this shit happens and he died. just great.\n\nthen 2 years ago the tax people came into his business and stated that he owed all the back taxes from the business that was their before us!!! yes I know its like WTF ????\n\nbut officers with guns locked the building and our only choice was to pay the thugs with guns to reopen the business so we could EARN money to TRY and fight this.\n\nI signed for a loan for $20,000 for that so we could reopen and have a chance of fighting.\n\nso now I have $38,000 in debt all from my pop but its all in my name only (his credit was hosed at this point massive medical debt and from being behind/defaulting on everything.)\n\nbut again. hindsight. the plan was eventually to sell the business and pay all this off. all would be right with the world.\n\nthen the state by fiat declares "I" am the financially responsible party. so the debt gets stuck to me not him (I think they knew he did not have much time left so stuck it to me as likely to live longer no joke I think that is what they did) and I have ZERO money to fight them. pops accountant is trying he is working on it I hope.\n\nThis is the core problem. I AM NOT A SIGNATORY. it was my dad's business. except for helping him work the counter (for free I might add) and helping him with computer stuff I was not legally a part of his business. the state has simple DECREED by fiat that I was.\n\nnow of course that he is dead I have no choice but to run the business (new corp new lease) since that is the only hope of paying down all this debt. but they are trying to use Bulk Sales Transfer to make me culpable as well as declaring that I HAVE BEEN financially responsible for years)\n\nI KNOW that does not sound right but how do you fight people with guns and no money?\n\nlandlord for the BUSINESS.\n\nyes it exists. 25 white horse pike 08215. the adult book store under the old massive acme sign. nightmare of my existence.\n\nwhy don't I stop? because stopping would ONLY remove the possibility of paying teh debt back. THE DEBT would still exist and I won't earn enough in the rest of my entire LIFE to pay this kind of debt down.\n\nwith the remortgage the store is the only thing paying the $1600 a month mortgage! lose the store I instantly lose the house before I can sell it for enough to pay down the debt and find another cheaper tax house.\n\nI simply don't earn enough to pay these bills! not remotely close.\n\nI lose the house I literally lose everything EXCEPT the debt which will survive even bankruptcy.\n\nI know it sounds like some fucked up shit from some cheezy dollar store nightmare novel and I am the main fucking character.\n\nOWE and I forgot the most entertaining part.\n\nTHere was never going to be a selling of the business. that was a delusional fantasy of his. its not worth anything.\n\nfun. how nice. so now I have no choice but to RUN a business I don't want to run because its the only chance of salvaging anything from my life (I no longer desire a wonderful peaceful life now my desire is simply no debt and lack of misery)\n\nit CAN make money. if the state will let me. if the landlord will let me. I can turn it around. I know what needs to be done. I think I could get it working well enough to pay off all my debt in 3 or 4 years and put asside a little to secure my sisters future if something happens to me (she is mentally handicapped and will need some level of guardianship for the rest of her life)\n\nI finally started the process to get her on SSI. something my father failed to do (pride/ego)\n\nits all a matter of CAN I do all this in time.

the bolt supports the weight (this is the STOCK factory mounting location and method for this vehicle)\n\nthe 3d printed part is only "centering" the wheel on the bolt. and its doing so in its strongest configuration (compression)\n\nthere is a pretty decent chance this is PLENTY strong enough for this application.\n\nI might print it in a firm TPU at which point it would be stronger and more forgiving in an accident than the factory component.\n\nHIS problem is that he can't close the hatch with that tire their anymore (its too large)\n\nunless its offset enough that the protrusion juts out into the "window" cavity of the hatch (it just might work)
it does. they are right.\n\ndue process makes law enforcement harder and less effective. they have to do more work to meet the burden of due process. due process reduces effectiveness but INCREASES accuracy (getting the right guy and not the innocent people)\n\nif they can't meet the burden of due process good people don't lose their shit but bad people also get away with shit.\n\nit depends on how you define "less effective"\n\nto the police "doing anything they want with the least amount of work" is most effective.\n\nto you and me it is not. especially when "WE" are in those cross hairs.\n\nSO what is my point? considering the effectively of law enforcement is a red herring. its the WRONG MARKER its the WRONG DISCUSSION.\n\nProtecting people and enforcing the constitution is what the marker should represent and what the discussion should be about.\n\neven if that makes law enforcement "less effective" at getting bad guys off the street.
what is your point? the smaller car will have both less M and less A resulting in less F.

Wait until you're older, son.
this is what I came to mention. he (box guy) did it first not this guy.
I got the same one! about 1 year old now. Freaking love it!
its not a cylinder. its a taper.\n\nNO PLA would never compare to factory molded. my comment in that regard was strictly for my idea of a TPU one (damned near indestructible and i mean that)\n\nso depending on his fill and pattern and extrusion width etc.. it might be plenty strong relative to the factory component.
keep twisting in the wind little man. keep twisting.\n\nthere was nothing to answer that was not already answered. its part of your tactics. you ask twisted circular logic questions and they go AHAHA gotcha even when you have .... nothing.\n\nkeep twisting traitor.

anyone got a non invasive download link? how much weight can it handle? of note of course its no a chair (neither is this one) but just the SEAT of the chair. I know a nitpick but ehhh.
I would estimate he was at 150-200ft and the plane was under 600ft maybe under 500ft. not by much though. there was more than 150ft vertical sep maybe 200 between drone and plane. plenty safety margin I would not have even changed course of have been concerned as either drone pilot or GA pilot.
a decade is not very good.\n\na NICAD will last 10 years. a NIMH will last 10 years. a LITHIUM pack will last 10 years.\n\nhow do they get "Exceptions long time" from "a tiny short period of time or 10 years"
its ok. I have never installed a windows update in 20 years except for SP packs for XP after they are vetted by the community for some time.\n\nI keep abreast of the major issues and know what to watch for and what application versions can be troublesome etc.. for serious issues.\n\nnever had an issue. ever. not once. strict user control (IE control the one at the keyboard) is the real key here.\n\nI have my own custom unattended XP and 7 installation discs I made up (well downloaded and customized)\n\nI run a firewall. I don't lets apps get online that have no business being online etc.. its really not that much work. once the discipline is in place its automatic.
because its not their money. that's why. there is very little downside if any to them.
the INTENDED outcome of having juries of your peers.
$1400 a month. I would live very very well indeed. that is $16,800 a year. I sell my house buy a cheaper house with much lower taxes. I can live decently for the rest of my life without much difficulty on that much money once the debt is all gone.

the warrant is to "GET" supposed evidence. not because THEY HAVE evidence.\n\nthis is why he is NOT CHARGED with anything.\n\nYou do not get to decide what is not in evidence. this is the VERY fucking scenario we are discussing.\n\nthey have NOTHING but suspicion. enough to get a warrant to "LOOK"\n\nbecause they are unable to look they are holding him FOREVER because he will not help them HURT HIMSELF.\n\nthe courts are VIOLATING the constitution. challenge the violation won't do shit since they are already violating it.\n\nits kind of like telling the guy about to blow your brains out with his gun that ahhh sir you know thats illegal right? BOOM.\n\nYOU support your claim.
distorted perspective (wide angle lens) and figure of speech.\n\nif that plane was a few yards away the air disturbance of its passage would have likely knocked the drone out of the air.

Jury Nullification is a fiction. What you mean is simply "jury's"\n\nthis fictional nullification aspect is not some special thing a jury can do. IT IS WHY WE HAVE A JURY to begin with.\n\nIt is the only REASON to have a jury of your peers.
from what I gather uber passes all taxes directly onto the drivers themselves.
This is actually a pretty decent deal.\n\n$8 and change on ebay (best price $8.30 shipped) but TYPICAL price is $10.59 to $21.99\n\nso all in all this is actually a pretty decent deal.

Compelling decryption is not the problem. Compelling the accused to do it for you is the problem.\n\ncompelling decryption is not the violation of the 5th amendment. compelling it OF THE ONE YOU ARE ACCUSING is the violation.\n\nyou already have your example. The state has NO evidence at all. just noise on a hard drive. and they are holding him in prison for 16 months because they can't see what that noise is.\n\nnothing more.\n\nwhy in the world would you ask for an example of this kind of abuse when you are REPLYING TO IT via this thread.\n\nI don't want to move my whole reply to this thread. read the other reply or go away.\n\nYOU give me an example of where it makes any sense to force the accused (who is presumed innocent) to do your prosecutorial duties FOR YOU to convict himself.\n\nremember ANY evidence gained can and will be used against you and ONLY against you. if there is nothing their you will NOT be permitted to use it to exonerate yourself. this is the law.
irrelevant. THE PURPOSE if the traffic disruption of lights and sirens IS SPECIFICALLY FOR the traffic disruption so people stop and get out of your SPEEDING WAY to avoid EXACTLY THIS from happening.\n\nthis is why its usually 100% ILLEGAL to do exactly what he just did for exactly the reason you just watched.
well. its not illegal to carry an EMP gun (since they don't exist yet there are not yet any laws regarding them)
law is law. what you DID is illegal not HOW you did it.\n\nsame applies here. HOW you " you are adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort" is irrelevant.\n\nyou did it. so yet again you are wrong and yet again I am right. you keep having to backpedal and twist and dodge and contort your mind to try and make your delusions real.\n\nI just keep quoting the law. like a rock. unchanging. you make it too easy.\n\ntraitor.
he is right. though I fear trump will be more max headroom/death race.
no. they are not. that is not what a jury is for.\n\nif the SOLE function was to determine if you did or did not break the law a professional bench of judges and jurors is far far far better equipped to do that far more fairly than a jury of your peers can.\n\nthe ONLY reason for it to be a jury of your peers is to be judged. by. your. peers. your peers will judge you. will judge the law and will judge the application of the law.\n\nthat is the point.\n\nthere is no functional difference unless you intentionally (and incorrectly) limit the "point" of a jury to be did the crime happen or not and did he do it.\n\nonce you remove that false restriction your fact is no longer fact.\n\ninstead of there being a functional difference as you note it is now simply a jury doing what a jury is SUPPOSED to do.\n\nJury nullification is a bullshit term to try and convince the population that the normal proper function of a jury is some sort of rogue vigilante improper immoral power a jury has.\n\nthis would only come into play when the law and crime are both societally sound but the jury aquits anyway (such as in the old days and maybe today as well aquitting a white guy for killing a black guy for example ie racism)\n\nyou can't have your cake and eat it too. with great power comes great responsibility and with that abuse.\n\nbut what you "define" as jury nullification is "the normal proper function and purpose" of a jury of your peers.\n\nNOT a jury is NOT the same thing as a jury of your peers.
ahhhhh I was thinking it said snoopy for prez but could not find the for 4 makes sense.

not as cheap as you think. its usually 3 to 5 % for each "transfer"
plane was not that close really. good vertical separation no issues. he WAS however lower than was likely legal depending on how populated the area is around that beech. if its not a city or town there might be no altitude limit for the pilot and he may have been fine that low.﻿
i can freaking tell you why. 3% minimum goes to the CC company.\n\n3% of a $20,000 car is nothing to sneeze at.
not ever american has taken an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of these united states.\n\nyou (claim) to have done so and your statements clearly indicate you have no confidence in that oath at all and have simply rejected it.\n\nthat would be treason.
keep deflecting buddy. keep deflecting. I will always be here for you with the mirror to help you out.
Got my just under $9 IDENTICAL watch today (same model sand brand) in 21 days. not bad for china really.\n\nits actually quite a nice looker and also (bonus) fits my gigantic wrists out of the box (I normally have to poke extra holes to make watches fit) I also really like the double tab latch. more durable especially in a cheaper watch.\n\nit seems to be a rather well built watch. it is LARGE so if you have small hands and don't like large watches you don't want this\n\nbut for those of us with very large hands its just right. its also beveled nicely so it does not jam into your wrist hard.\n\nclearly the crystal is likely just plain glass or maybe plastic (feels nice looks nice can't quite tell if its glass or plastic) but its nicely recessed in the watch face so not prone to taking hits. Its probably plastic.\n\nI like it. I would not pay $20 for it but its a bargain at $9 and actually does have EL illumination.\n\nalso has stopwatch and alarm (cheap watches are usually missing those function as well as the EL) and the secondary displays are functional (day at top seconds on right time on bottom)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SLL0ILu.jpg\n\nsorry for the lack luster picture I forgot to take the plastic film off the crystal before the picture.
yep. two characters on the left of snoopy and at least 9 pumpkins.\n\nand it says snoopy at the bottom and maybe prez ?
oops forgot you can't speak english very well.\n\nWho said anything about law. We are talking about OATH breaking (you) not Law Breaking (though you probably break those too)\n\ncatch up slomo.
more reflection deflection. you simply describe yourself. Here look into my mirror.
negative. I have more than 10 year old 2000mah NIMH cells that still contain 1500mah capacity or more.\n\nNicads. been too long but I have gotten more than 10 years with over 50% capacity.\n\nhell my electric car is degrading like mad and it has undergone 733 cycles (not charges cycles) and has only lost some 20% of its capacity and it was abused by the PO.\n\nin the 714 cycles I have charged it I have only lost 8% capacity. (12% loss when I bought it with 4800 miles on it)\n\nall of these numbers are no where near 75% capacity loss in 10 years or 2000 cycles.\n\nwhere do you get this fiction from? seriously?\n\nthe problem I have with the article is ONE angle makes the batteries out to be amazing (less than 1% of its capacity per 1000 cycles) which is absolutely amazing.\n\nbut then it says simply more than a decade (which implies only JUST a decade)\n\nSo what gives? at even 1% per 1000 that means 50,000 cycles down to 50% SOC\n\nin a properly scaled household application that is if we assume 4 day typical capacity with degradation buffer so you can go 7 days if you push it that means I can run the packs down to what? 55% before I can't get 4 days any longer?\n\nthat is 45,000 cycles or 494 YEARS\n\nwhich WOULD be absolutely fantastic.\n\nbut I already know its bullshit or they would be saying 400 years not more than a decade.\n\nso which is it? is it 45,000 cycles and nearly 500 years or is it a decade.\n\nhell if you cycle the damned thing DAILY that is still 123 YEARS to 55% SOC\n\nI smell bullshit or a really bad article.
fucking bullshit. civilians get CRUCIFIED in the media first and then quietly later they release the "facts"
why even bother? inflation is 3.3% so at 1% your still losing 2.3%
your going to have to be more clear than that.\n\nthere is no conflicting information I am aware of. I am not really concerned with how this is supposed to work IT IS in fact how it is being applied to me (right or wrong)

no. it was not. the second amendment has nothing to do with natives and foreign governments.\n\nit has to do with first we "ask" (1st amendment) and if you ignore us we stop asking (2nd)\n\nthat is why it was written. NO OTHER REASON.
the point is people don't "save" because there is no point. it just devalues. it serves no function unless you have a LOT.
no issue. plenty of vertical separation.
this was not a car accident. it was a crime. big difference.\n\nhe was breaking the law doing what he did intentionally. like me drinking and driving.\n\nnot a "simple" accident.
For the average person for whom this is actually important 6 months of expenses is literally 6 months of 100% of their income.\n\nthat's simply not possible/feasible for most people at this income level.\n\nhell my TAXES are 70.65% of my total income (long story pop screwed me before he died)\n\nif I had ZERO debt at all it would take me 4 or 5 YEARS of spending "$0" at all to put away 6 Months. that includes food.\n\ndepending on where you live of course once you get past $30k a year or $32k (median income) things become a lot easier or at least manageable if you handle things correctly and get lucky.\n\nbelow median? forget it.\n\neven once I somehow figure out how to get lucky enough to survive long enough to sell this damned house and move I will still be looking at a tax base of over 45-50% of my income.\n\nmy longer term plan is to put away 3 years of property taxes and insurance. this way at least my home will be safe for a small period of time if the shit hits the fan but even that is impossible until I can sell this place and move.
once again you can't read. READ WHAT I SAID AGAIN (ALL of it not just a snip-it out of context). and KEEP reading it until your small retarded tiny slow little mind can almost grasp it.\n\n" you are adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort." is the crime.\n\nviolating your oath is the method you use to commit "adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."\n\nwhich is treason by the constitution.\n\nI know this simple stuff is hard for you to grasp. take it slowly. keep reading it. you will get it. I have faith in you.\n\nno. I don't, but it sounded good.
the worst is property/school taxes. 43.3% of what I make ($18k a year delivery driver) $7800 a year (no its not an expensive house it is just in Levittown PA (bristol twnshp) which has some of the very highest taxes there is.\n\nthe rest is normal taxes. the multiple federal income taxes local county and state income taxes and sales taxes.\n\npop left me with $209k in debt remortgaged the house I already paid for (apparently he never filed the deed change 20 years ago and I was too young to know better so I am now stuck with that which is $80k of that debt)\n\noh and the state of NJ has decreed by fiat that I was the financially responsible party for my DAD's business and owe $57k in sales and use tax which would survive bankruptcy.\n\nand now the landlord wants out. if she sells the property I will lose the business (which pays me absolutely $0) which is my only hope of EVER dreaming of paying down this debt.\n\nyep. the universe really fucking hates me ehh :-)

you don't understand. the issue is not responding to calls with or without sirens and lights.\n\nthe issue is both SPEEDING and RUNNING A RED LIGHT without even slowing slightly with no lights and no sirens.\n\nI am aware of not one single town where this is either legal or policy. anywhere.
it is. think hot spots.

all but the crappiest PLA's should be strong enough with that much infill as long as your temps were high enough and you did not use spiral IE criss cross layers.\n\nprobably stronger than the factory component especially if you used a good pla like esun pla pro.\n\njust watch the HEAT in the summer. pla's really hate heat. IE paint it white at least.

like everything else I say it makes perfect sense to normal people. It makes no sense to irrational people.\n\nI think any member of the military "like you" belongs in prison. oath breakers are committing treason.\n\nthankfully most of the military is not like you.\n\nYes. you do need help. the VA has a huge amount of resources for people who serve. even oath breakers. use it.
3% on $20k is a straight up $600 immediately.\n\neven if you manage $600 payments ($1200 first months payment) in 18 months that is only slightly less than HALF the debt paid. then you have to pay another $324 to transfer that to another card and this assumes first that you have another $11,000 card to transfer the balance too and second that you have another 18 months 0% period starting at the right time and third that its only 3% and not 5%\n\nso AT BEST $924 in interest and this is assuming you can make $600 monthly payments.\n\nHonestly though if you can manage that. not a bad overall interest rate at all for a new car.

a good household batter pack would give you at least 4 days power ideally a week (though a week can get very expensive depending on your power needs)\n\nthat is 50 to 90 cycles per year. at 2000 cycles 22 to 40 years. the battery chem itself will self wear before you burn those cells with cycling.\n\neven Lead Acids should net you 10 usable years if cared for properly and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nideally go with Nickle Iron. will last longer than you will live and are very tolerant to neglect and abuse.\n\nif life ever permits me that is the chem I will use.\n\nas I said. 10 years is shit. and they are going gagga for it as if it means anything. 100 years. now that would get me excited.
the 5th amendment has nothing to do with shielding against crime. you are still not grasping reality here.\n\nThe point of the 5th amendment is to make sure the BURDEN of that investigation is not on the ACCUSED.\n\nThis is not about "only I can authorize a search"\n\na warrant does not give the government the right to anything. if give they the power to "go find/get/uncover"\n\nthe point of the 5th amendment is such that the government can't decide\n\n"I want to charge you with XXX" now you go get me whatever I need to charge and convict you with XXX. I hearby order you to put the noose around your own neck and if you don't you get the noose anyway"\n\nTHAT is what the 5th is for. it literally means.

YES. I am suggesting just that. They do it daily.\n\nyou would be absolutely bat shit astonished at what little they need to get a warrant today.\n\nfrom what I understand friends/family stated he had this material and that is ALL THEY HAVE to go on which is why he has NOT been charged.\n\nyou are wrong. suspicion is all that is needed for many warrants.\n\nyou are dead wrong.\n\nnow if you MEANT to say what are they SUPPOSED to need to get a warrant OK now you are onto something. sadly we don't live in that world any longer.\n\nThe judge "is" the state. in these discussions I will not and never will bother to look up specific titles and names and any other such nonsense.\n\nI will simply refer to the prosecutions side as "the state"

> I also stopped donating this past year because of my disgust with topics that were half discussed that seemed to push a narrative for the first time in a decade.\n\nI stopped donating a few years ago for the same reason. They used to get hundreds of dollars from me every year but will never get a penny until they straighten up.\n\nNPR's bias isn't outright cheerleading like you get from Fox or MSNBC, it's more subtle in WHAT they choose to cover/omit and to what degree.
No, it's a state school and the campus is public property.
Why do so many people decide to move here without securing employment first? Nearly every day this exact same question is asked.\n\nYou all make terrible life choices.
Yes, bedtime was a hassle until we started using the Ferber method around 6 months. Before then he was an awful sleeper, up crying every 45 minutes and getting miserable sleep throughout the night. He'd be overtired all day, wouldn't be able to take decent naps and the cycle would begin again every night. It was unsustainable and unhealthy for everyone in the house.\n\nA few days after starting he would be asleep moments after being put in the crib and often slept through the entire night. Nowadays [rarely] he can sleep in the bed with us if he's having trouble staying asleep due teething/sickness but only after trying to sleep on his own for a while. \n\nRead the appropriate sleep training books in their entirety and follow the instructions... do not just let your baby cry.  The first few nights are going to be tough but I promise you your child will probably spend less time crying in the night while starting CIO than he currently is.
Then you need to put a boot in your son's ass and stop letting him think there's a difference between how he's expected to behave in and outside of home.
It would be kinda foolish with a victory already guaranteed.\n\nAuburn had nothing to lose by not quitting and playing the game out.
Turlington Plaza is a large chokepoint on the UF campus. It's at the crux of a large bus stop, several major campus buildings, and a dining hall.\n\nAll the crazies tend to congregate there for attention. Nearly every day there's a guy carrying a cross and preaching against gay people. Students getting into debates with nutjobs is situation normal in Turlington.
I don't care what problems you have going on, my life is worth more *to me* than yours, so if you do something stupid that could kill me on the roads I'm going to be pissed at you.
> Sears thinks they can continue selling the same products and trying to sell everything from garden tractors to tires or beds to women's shoes to jewelry to screwdrivers to ping-pong tables to microwaves and somehow make money doing it. Never going to happen.\n\nAmazon and Costco have no trouble with this model. The difference is they're both give a shit about the consumer.\n\nI agree with you that there is definitely room in the marketplace for specialized, curated retail like you described in a "Sears and Robuck" store. If I could shop at a store that only sold a limited selection of high quality appliances/tools/etc, that would always be my first choice.  I don't like having to spend days researching the best dishwasher or washing machine before pulling the trigger on a purchase. I want to shop at a store that only sells the best and will stand by their product after it's been sold.
US farmed channel catfish is safe, sustainable, and cheap. Eat them.
But if he really payed them to do it, it's a 2-for-1 deal.
Good think AR15s are one of the least deadly weapons in America, then.\n\nThe fact that liberals focus so much on something that is responsible for statistically insignificant numbers of deaths in this country shows me they're insincere with their public safety gun control arguments.

On most carriers, that's additional leg room, not seat width.\n\nI know this because I'm a somewhat skinny guy who always ends up sandwiched between obese people who didn't realize the difference. 
You said you were flying Southwest, so don't follow this particular advice. If you're the last to board on Southwest you will not get seats together.\n\nBoard during the family boarding call, SW tends to board quicker than most other airlines anyways.

Yes, everyone knows about those backwater, trailer park hicks of CHARLESTON. 
If it's recovered insurance won't pay a replacement claim.
Its 2017. There's no more sexual dimorphism. Get over it.
If you don't use your tools often or professionally, Harbor Freight is a great for initial purchases. If you break a HF socket wrench, it's likely you use it enough to justify paying for a higher quality brand.  But even if you don't you can still return it for a free replacement. \n\nAlso, probably not a good idea to buy anything from HF that could kill you if it breaks while using it.

Most of the sims use a collimated visual system. There is a semi-transparent white plastic spherical section that sits right above the cockpit:\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S8bsOEFppac/UR2sz6cMt8I/AAAAAAAABoc/hvpV46MJgi8/s1600/CD-2260.jpg\n\nThere are 3-6 (typically) projectors that project onto this screen. \n\nOut the window is a mylar screen thats held into a perfect spherical section by a vacuum pump. This reflects the image from the plastic and makes the visuals appear seamless and 3 dimensional.\n\nThis DIY setup does a good job of showing how the system works:\n\nhttp://www.diy-cockpits.org/coll/\n\nProjectors are high-end halogen, DLP, or LED sytems made specifically for simulation. They have to be robust to withstand the vibration and motion of a moving simulator. Most of them are made by Christie, Rockwell Collins, or a few other specialized companies.\n\n\n\n
Yes, but restaurant suppliers don't buy directly from the local fisherman.  \n\nMost fish (and especially sushi) is caught by factory fishing ships and  flash frozen immediately after it's caught.
Reverse the races of the victim and attackers and imagine a white southern sheriff saying this in 1960s Alabama. That's how backwards that whole statement sounds.
Any good that's shipped in bulk on a truck would be placed on a pallet anyways, it's not an extra step for the supplier...
I know it sucks getting shafted, but SeaTac workers need to stop sandbagging in protest, though.\n\nThat airport has the slowest baggage handling, security, and transportation employees in the whole fucking country.
Exactly - Express lanes coupled with a cheap BRT (lightrail on wheels) system that utilizes them would be ideal.
It's barely dropped below 80 all winter :/
If you like good UAW stories, look into the shit that happened at the Freemont plant (now Tesla factory) in the 70's before Toyota took over the factory.\n\nUnion workers ran prostitution rings, sold drugs, and deliberately sabotaged the cars they were assembling with total impunity.
That may be the upper limit they'll reimburse you for, but you'll never make anything close to that back.\n\nTECO reimburses you (once a year) for any surplus power you generate, but they pay the *fuel* rate for the power you make. Right now that's like 3 cents/kWh.  To make 350 dollars a month you'll need to generate 11.5 MWh of surplus power, which is impossible on a residential install.  \n\nThis month has had great weather for solar and my 10kW system will likely produce less than 1.5MWh in total, and my house used half of that. I'll probably make just enough extra electricity to cover TECO's 15 dollar maintenance charge this month if I'm lucky.\n\n\nedit - were you thinking of their electric disconnect reimbursement? You need a special utility disconnect switch installed on your house when you install a solar system, TECO will pay up to 350 dollars to reimburse you for that cost.
Yeah, but nowadays kids can just use internet encarta to play maze games.
Don't go through Solar City, there are better options than leasing a system.  \n\nThe cost to install solar in Tampa is well below the national average (2.00-$2.50/Watt installed *before* the federal rebate). You're looking at 7-10 years ROI if you buy a system outright or finance it yourself.\n\nSolarCity will lock you into a 20 year agreement where you're printing them money for most of the term and they'll put a lien on your house. You don't own the system and can't take advantage of the federal tax credit. If you decide to sell your home in the future, buyers may not want to assume your contract so you'll have to pay a penalty to remove the system.\n\nA few things to keep in mind - \n\nIf you install solar, you still have to pay TECO 15 dollars a month to be connected to the grid.\n\nPowerwall doesn't make sense financially unless you're using it for emergency backup or completely off grid. TECO power is cheap and it's better to upsize your system and draw from your net metering surplus at night rather than a battery.
Don't pay for DNS or a static IP, just use duckdns.org
Yes, that was the price before the federal tax credit.\n\nVery happy with the price and service.
You know who *else* was "just sticking up for order"?

I like to use the fire extinguisher in your kitchen analogy (rather than tire jack). Little bit more accurate from a likelyhood of use standpoint.
> An interesting way to stay safe could be to lock the gun up and mail the key to your destination. Then you never have access while in the dangerous state.\n\nCan't do that, in order to check a firearm onto a plane you may have to open your case for TSA inspection.
Just buy the similar set from Harbor Freight. They also have a lifetime warranty and will probably be around longer than Sears.
Finally get a full week of seasonal temperatures.
> The driver was 78 years old, as well\n\nJust another day on the roads in Florida. Old people accidentally kill someone else and go on to keep their license another few decades.
Wasn't really his fault.
Good luck getting Target to replace the craftsman jigsaw you bought at sears 15 years ago.
The dogs are also raised as livestock, not pets. 
Telling home gardeners they can't apply any pesticide because they'll make bees go extinct is ridiculous.  \n\nResidential use is orders of magnitude less than agricultural, and common garden pesticides  like carbaryl, pyrethrum/pyrithrins, and Bt aren't responsible for colony collapse.
That fucking clap
Yeah, I LOVE seeing stuff like this on my frontpage every 3 days.
So does Trump have a secret alliance with Russia that allowed him to get elected or does he want to start a nuclear war with them? \n\nIt can't be both.
> Fatal hit and run. Something like the 30th one in central FL this year(2016). A record, and only like 6 people got caught for them.\n\nFun fact about why those are so common - over 1/3rd of the people on roads in Florida have legally mandated auto insurance.
That is the one downside to southwest, a lot more "large" travelers.\n\nAnd if you're a person of narrow stature they like to single you out as a travel companion.
I figure they got it right if the guy is bragging in court about jerking it to the thought of murdering the victim.
He's about the age where his contemporaries started getting cell phones before drivers licenses.
I work in that industry, you'd be surprised.\n\nA lot of the older simulators use proprietary computing hardware and IO systems, I'm talking real dinosaur 1980s unix systems.\n\nNowadays everything is run on off-the-shelf Xeon servers. The visual systems are pretty basic aside from using top-end graphics cards. 
> Powder Mountain is one of the clearest resorts out there. All the tourists stick to Park City/Alta/Snowbird/Deer Valley and leave that massive place alone\n\nDidn't it recently get bought out and turned into a resort catering to techie/silicon valley types?
That's not available yet, the current SE7600A-US model is only officially compatible with Powerwall 1.\n\nI learned that lesson the hard way after I installed a SE7600A-US 2 weeks before the powerwall 2 announcement.  Although I don't see why the old unit wouldn't be compatible with the DC-tied Powerwall 2, unless the data connection is different between the two models.

When I was a kid  I would have to wipe the ice off my bus seat  and/or defrost my car windshields for a few minutes when going the school in the morning.  When I got home it was my job to hang blankets on the citrus and other sensitive plants to keep them from freezing.\n\nI don't even think I've turned the heat on in my car since the one bad freeze we had 6 (?) years ago.  Fuck anyone who says this is normal weather. They either have a terrible memory or aren't from around here.\n\n
"Spare the rod, spoil the child" means the opposite of how you used it, but good post.\n\nSpanking should only be used as a way to get a point across to a little human who doesn't have the ability to think logically or understand consequences... not beat the fear of an angry parent into them. I'm of the opinion that a (relatively) gentle spanking by a calm parent is fine, but a walloping by a parent who is losing their composure is never ok.
Do not open your gun case for an airline attendant! It's a BAD idea to expose a firearm in an airport and you have legal obligation to do so. You only have to allow them to see that the case is locked and place the declaration decal on it.\n\nYou *might* be asked to have TSA examine the weapon, but that will be in a closed area away from the public.

Where did you find it for $250? I can't even find beat up Ishapores on auction sites for less than 350-400.
It's not your employers responsibility to accommodate your bad decisions. The value of your labor doesn't increase with the number of offspring you have.
Unless you party up. I just started playing that game along with a few other newbies this week. We are all less than rank 20, but get matched with level 250+ and get stomped when we group up. 
A lot of people come into these threads with an agenda and fail to see the nuance between between beating the living hell out your 3 year old because you're mad that they won't be quiet and calmly swatting his behind when he keeps trying to electrocute himself with the Christmas tree lights anytime your back is turned.
That's not low if you live in Taylor county driving a logging truck for a living. Let Miami-Dade set their own minimum wage regulations.
> Oddly enough, as someone who has no objection to incest themes in porn (really, they're unavoidable these days)\n\n*Why did this particular genre seem to come out of nowhere in the last few years?* \n\nIt's all over every website and is a huge turnoff (to me).

Not dumb kids, but lots of kids and parents choose not to engage.  Education is not valued the same way in, say, Tillamook as it is in Beaverton or whatever.\n\nHence, the expression, "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink".

This whole thing is just a reminder that Philadelphia is absolutely the worst city on the East Coast.\n\nDirty, poorly governed, high crime, and the people are the biggest assholes in the world.  Plus, their accent sucks.
So a riot on Wednesday means the police declaring martial law (not even the mayor or governor) on Saturday is appropriate?  What old woman spits on police?

Well assuming it is 9 miles then it's very feasible that they could just drive 5 miles in the opposite direction at the starting point.  5 out + 5 back + 9 there = 19 miles.

You're just making up generalities about "most large cities" with no evidence and then saying everyone else needs to stop following their own biases?\n\nThat's some nice cognitive dissonance.
You must be the world's worst negotiator.
This owns.  I got karma to spare, so who gives a shit.  It's also kinda scary, though, because this dude is sitting in a trailer in like Sutherlin thinking about Milo kissing children.
Just because your dumbass city or county has shitty public schools doesn't mean all public schools are bad.\n\nIn good public schools, we learned logic and critical thinking skills.
Portland PD is out of control with this shit.\n\nThey unilaterally declared martial law on the Saturday following the election and fired rubber bullets at a crowd of non-protesters at Pioneer Square, breaking windows and sending old people and families running for cover.\n\nThey were rolling around, a dozen deep, with full body armor screaming at *anyone* on the streets.  We had to hole up in our hotel, and they recommended we don't leave, or else we get arrested.\n\nI lived in DC for a decade, where there are protests are larger and more rancorous than this, and real security threats, and yet I have never been more scared of the police than that night.  Police vans cruising around with loudspeakers blaring ordering people to stay off the street all night.
CHEMTRAILS... MAKING THE FRICKIN FROGS GAY
Lol I just went to a lecture he gave at my university and things were going well until the end, when he blamed millenials for Trump, because not enough of us voted for Clinton.\n\nThis was in Eugene, Oregon.
Yuppie is not purely a perjorative.
Each city is unique.
Why aren't they in the vehicle lane?
Cool; where does the article say these people caused $1 million in damage?  On the Saturday night after the election, what $1 million in damages were caused?  Remember, the police were breaking windows, too.
Didn't they say like 5 times they were talking about the fakeass college-educated ones?
PS everyone: that's the Pentagon in the beginning.
I was just offered heroin there.
No unemployment, low crime.
I'll continue to block you guys in and cut you off, etc.
I mean, obviously not you, since you're a Trump account, but if anyone else who isn't a MAGA-C.H.U.D. happens upon this post, then them.\n\nI do appreciate your candor.
Better than zero.\n\nI know some Cubans who agree with you; they got their serfs taken away during the Revolution.
Right, you should always make more money from the flag drop fee than from running up the meter; that's the whole point of the fee, right?
Yeah look at this idiot.\n\nI can't believe he thinks choosing future indulgence overy present indulgence makes you more wealthy.\n\nInvesting instead of dining out makes you poor. TIL.
Like it or not, there will alway be an association between delaying gratification and performing well in society. It's not the only performance indicator but to deny that drug abusers can't delay gratification is idiocy.\n\nAlso, middle class is lower class these days. Managers at McDonald's self report as middle class.
They pretty much are.\n\nIf something goes wrong it is the fault of the person who wrote the faulty code or built the faulty hardware.
It suggests that there could be widespread corruption in the departments that these employees are a part of. \n\nIt does not suggest that the entire law enforcement structure is corrupt as a whole. There are just pockets of shit in shitty places for the most part.
The demand for abx resistant gonnhorrea is booming.
>low testosterone can create more stress\n\nAlso, testosterone potentiates the fight/flight response which gives males more power to evade harm.\n\nThis is why crimes against women and children are seen the way they are. You arent some bringer of godly knowledge, you are just a scared male who wants to be the victim.\n\nBe brave Napoleon.
Obviously.\n\nYour parents pass their wealth on to you.
If you have fat stores, you don't need calories. Nutrients can come through \n\nGotta skew the tables so the emotional burden of eating too much is greater than the stress relief it provides.
Lol. Sure, reject the idea that investing in future at the cost of present indulgence doesn't make you wealthier.\n\nJust because all rich people don't delay gratification doesn't mean there isn't correllation.
Hating facebook is trendy.
Sc2 is great to watch. Unfortunately some of your points are valid.
Some of us have metabolism that work this way.
Lol. You got demolished in the argument and have to call edgy. Forlolsakes.
So talent for taking a future reward at the cost of present time indulgence doesn't give you an advantage in becoming wealthy? That is the exact definition of how to become wealthy. Stop dining out and put the money into stocks or other investments.\n\nWe millenials love the homeless and the drug abusers too much. I'm a good person cause I tell them it's not their fault right? 
Men only care about feminine bodies. As long as women dont grow back hair and become the hulk i think we be ok.
Consuming sugar is not good when fasting. Might as well not fast if you are going to take in calories.
Your last paragraph is not based on anything scientific and is harmful to the whole situation.\n\nThere could very easily be a threshold aren't aware of that could trigger calamity in the former of temperature, acidity, weather patterns, etc. We should stop co2 emissions as quickly as possible without creating irreparable harm to people.
What da fuck? Who cares.
Some people have weird metabolisms that scales with calorie consumption.\n\nI usually eat around 1400 calories a day but every few months I get the motivation to bulk up and take hi calorie protein shakes in am and hs + a loaded Chipotle burrito each day. Over the course of a few months I gain weight up to about 160 from my base of 155 but never go anywhere beyond the 160.\n\nThen I give up and drop back to 155.
Stress takes a toll on the body. Manual labor is healthy.\n\nDoesnt matter if you have a desk job or haul concrete all day. What kills your body is stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep.
People lash out in violence because they are afraid, not because they are brave.
How is siding with the police in one instance but not the other complaining?
Word you.looking for is shitty, not complicated.
Obesity is a medical illness and has risks associated.
Well, there are abusers amongst the police and amongst nurses.
I had never come across and unskippable ad longer than 10 seconds until 2016. Didn't they just start allowing them? 
Lol there is a sad amount of positivity regarding Alex Jones in here. WTF is wrong with people?
I'm a nurse. It's not false. \n\nUrgent care exists for a reason.
I can trigger asmr on command. I do a weird thing with my throat+neck muscles and gives happy tingles everywhere. I learned to do this after having a small bleed in my thalamus. Happy little anyeurisms. OK storytelling over.
Without accidental pregnancies we will end up dying off like Germany and Japan.
More successful people are also able to delay gratification more reliably, so they are more likely to realize that destroying your own existence so you can feel good on an opiate high is a losing situation.\n\nFunny how we are not willing to acknowledge facts because it would make drug abusers accountable for their own predicament.
Probably eating bear poop. Cats love eating poop.
You dont learn history but you learn to think.
I don't do it. I just know there are a lot of idiots out there who do.\n\nThat said, if a patient regularly shows up on drugs, and their symptoms routinely match those of a heart attack, you cannot blame the medical staff for not treating it as a heart attack.\n\nThey possibly might not even run the labs to rule it out if the patient shows up multiple times a week.
I find it a lot deeper than the predecessors. Unfortunately, the AI is terrible.\n\nI would be so happy if they could build an AI that was semi competent instead of just giving free stuff to them every turn.\n\nI always got crushed on anything above king in the old games. Now even immortal is stupidly easy once you get beyond the first couple thousand years.
He was too rational for breitbart.
If you are bleeding profusely they will immediately place an IV and initiate IV fluids and or blood transfusion.\n\nEvery urgent care has vancomycin which is the standard treatment for c. diff.\n\nA deep animal bite is not an emergency unless you are suffering from substantial blood loss. The only reason to go to an ER in this case is because they will get you a bed in the hospital more quickly. An urgent care can clean a wound just as well as an ER. Yes it is very important for it to get cleaned, but cleaning it within the first hour or after 4 hours will not have an impact on outcome.
Wow its someone who has my take on human rights.\n\nWe need to get this woman the Nobel Peace prize.
Even with brain aneurysms there are things you can do to mitigate or remove risk.\n\nWith terror attacks only mitigating option is conceal carry everywhere you go.
Wooooa bae. I'm a political anomaly.\n\nWorking class was only mentioned because that was a major part of his pandering.\n\nAre you saying a degree is useless? \n\nAlso, a 4 year degree is more like 20k and that's on the high end if you are smart and use resources. As long as you aren't in school for interpretive dance you will guaranteed earn many times that in your lifetime that you would not have without the degree.\n\nI got my BSN from UoP of all places and it has already netted me 20k more a year that wouldn't have been possible with just my RN. UoP has a terrible public image and it's making me money, a decent school would make bank.
But women typically have horrid spacial perception. Maybe that is what they lose from the reduced neural capacity.
Haa. No reason validates the abuse of an innocent. Trouble is determining who is innocent.
I never said anything about shaming. You can respectfully order a patient to stop eating shit food. Some respectfully assertive communication is very helpful to people who are destroying their own lives.\n\nObviously if you are putting a patient on an NPO diet, you are giving parenteral nutrition.
They are promoting it because it will be able to retain a significant portion of those they can expose to it because it is a great product.\n\nUnderperforming implies it has a market share that was less than was forecast.\n\nI am not an emotional person. I am perfectly comfortable with enjoying something flawed. HOTS is not flawed though, it is incredibly well designed and that is why they are working to make it competetive in a market that has very little room for newcomers.
But when in typical use will you need to spam the play pause button? 
Well it could be that you are the crazy one and don't realize it. Or they could just be shit humans and bad employees.\n\nIf you are going to the ER and they aren't immediately putting you on some sort of medication or oxygen, you don't need to be at the ER.
Wtf is uygur? 
She should be marched around the city nude while chanting shame and whipping her.
Women and kids are more vulnerable and do not have testosterone which lets you tolerate this sort of stuff without such stress.
My 2 year old knows what consequences are. Modern humans are perpetual infants.
Lol. Buffalo wild wings tried something like that where they gave each table a "Fun Coach"
Taking it so seriously only trivializes the more significant events like late term loss and planned loss.\n\nUnknown pregnancy terminations are a joke compared to planned pregnancies and late term misscarriage.
Lol what does this even mean? 
Shit comes in many colors.\n\nAsshole might be very smart and honest. Angel might be half retarded and a lying SOB.
You don't seem to understand that article.\n\nRaping a rapist can be justice as long as it helps the rapist understand the significance of raping someone and brings closure to the victim.\n\nThe victim deserves some degree of involvement in the determination of punishment.
Well, some of us will create meaning. Some of us will eat ourselves to death. Such is life.
This deserves a sacrifice in its honor.
Quick match is supposed to be chaos. Anyone complaining that qm didn't give them a fair match doesn't understand the purpose of it. It is to expose you to different compositions and have to try to design a strategy that can win. It is also for learning how heroes work together and how they counter one another. \n\nDoesn't matter if the teams are even. Doesn't matter if you die 100 times. It's just there so you can learn without impacting rank and mmr. Also QM and it's strange compositions can yield valuable data on balance since it isn't following the 1-2 tank, 1 support meta 100% of the time like ranked does.\n\nQM is a good thing. Just l2 control emotions.
Thou shalt be inhibited and insecure.
Well football is awful so it's reasonable to neg it in front of people you know well.
I love garden but hate warhead and bay.
First beer from vaginal yeast and now titty liquor.\n\nThis kind of stuff gives incels and other weird men's rights fanatics credibility.\n\nWho did the marketers anticipate would buy this? Is anyone actually buying it? 
Weren't there a few witnesses who reported seeing tray on smashing Zimmerman head into the pavement? 
If they cant treat it, their provider will typically order a direct admit to a bed on the med/surg floor at the local hospital.\n\nDoesnt need to go through the ER unless its an emergency. Emergency means it needs immediate treatment.
I have the same situation with food. If I skip all my meals during the work day, 1 beer is great. If I eat during the day I'm gonna down at least 4 and still won't be as good.
Yeah I guess your right. I was thinking charismaless players but I can think of quite a few that I enjoy.\n\nI do think the korean to english translations need to go though. Those are rough.
Refusing to watch something because of the platform it is presented on is embarrassing.\n\nPeople will choose not to watch something they are interested in because the stress of supporting BOTH facebook and HOTS is too much of a social reject burden for them to bear.
Only idiots think someone deserves to die because they don't have money. \n\nThat said, I do think people who spend their money and time on drugs instead of honoring obligations to family and society deserve to die. But it's not my job to bestow that upon them.\n\nThe only people who might have felt you deserve to die are those you may have treated poorly during a bout of frustration. They probably think you are an asshole because you took out your frustration on them when the they were just the messenger of a broken system.
Lol wtf is this shit? 
You should spend some time with some of the shit humans who abuse ER services with no intention of ever paying.\n\nEach time.one of them dies it is a blessing on all of us.
Lol. Applebees ensuring they keep their white trash customers on lockdown. Military people dont want their own parking spots. Its just rednecks who will see this and be all MURICAAAAAA.
The problem with this is that there is no correlation between saying you will make a concise effort and actually accomplishing energy conservation. SAD!
The reason they are cross promoting with HOTS is because MOBAS have the largest esports market. They already own the mmo market and have strong presence in the fps market.\n\nYour original point is dumb. Promoting something isn't an indication that it is underperforming. It is an indication that the product is viable and there is room in the market for it to grow.
I have a similar experience, except polar opposite.\n\nI noticed one day I couldn't feel temperatures in my right hand and I set up a clinic appt to have it checked out. They ordered a CT and by the time the MD saw the results I was already back home. MD called me and told me I need to go to the ER immediately. I told her I don't have insurance so I wasnt going to. She convinced me that I have to so i came back in. They drove me to an icu 60 miles away in an ambulance because local place didn't have the tools needed.\n\nER ran tons of tests and I kept trying to refuse because I wasn't insured and but the doctors insisted it was necessary.\n\nI talked with one of their financial reps and asked what they could do for me and she said she would see what she could do.\n\nI ended up being in the icu being monitored for 3 days with mri and other exams and didn't ever receive a bill for any of it.\n\nI had a bleed in my brain from drinking vodka, taking aspirin, and taking fish oil. They never admitted that could be the cause though.\n\nThey said unknown cause and assumed I hit my head but wouldn't tell them.\n\nMaybe you should move to.mn.
Claiming corruption is rampant is just as bad as claiming it doesnt exist. Gotta go by the evidence son.
Lol they used a thumbnail of white on black and the video looks like a black guy spraying a white woman. Gotta get that race baiting going hard.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with how they handled the male prisoner. Dumb dumb dumb.
Doctors do need to learn to do basic troubleshooting though when it comes to computers.
Hate is good when it is selfless.\n\nEye for an eye is perfect if you have a way of interpreting the weight of circumstances as they are perceived by each party.
I'm just saying it validates some of the weirdo viewpoints on society.
The values and traditions will die when immigrant children become the majority.\n\nIt's not a terrible thing but is kind of sad.\n\nIt's weird that we stop having kids as we develop I to first world countries.
Pretty sure manual labor is good for long term health.
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
Stephano ain't Korean son.
Pretty sure the elites don't go to work. They send people to represent them.
They did nothing wrong in the treatment of the male.
thats just weird fucking behavior.
Yeah thats my point. Stupid people ruin it.
AI is very bad at combat. That is the only real issue in my opinion.
It's common knowledge that there is more drug abuse amongst the poor.\n\nSure the rich may use drugs but the don't destroy their own lives by going overboard.\n\nThis shit is why trump supporters exist, confrontational sjw hyperempathizers on the liberal side are just as cancerous as the retarded white power trump voters on the right.
Cause they heard young whippersnappers were leaving facebook for snapchat.\n\nI stopped using facebook but I'm still gonna watch the Dorms.
Looking for players on central us servers between plat and diamond who enjoy running atypical compositions and who like to argue/debate and enjoy drowning lonely nights with booze.\n\nI'm an introverted niceguy but can enjoy people who like a bit of salt with their hots as long as they don't take themselves too seriously.\n\nHoping to find some people who enjoy thinking for themselves instead of just regurgitating hots logs stats and parroting meta.\n\nI get home from work between 6 and 7 cst on weeknights and have weekends off.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zQ00laVt62c
Obesity is an illness. Good for the doctor, shame on the dieticians for enabling obesity.\n\nIfor I was obese and didnt have the willpower to save myself I would be praying for and doc to do that.
lol thisis the most psuedoscience BS i ever heard.
Yes MN is Minnesota.\n\nI've only worked with a few native American patients but they were all very belligerent, noncompliant, and refused to see the situation from any perspective other than their own.\n\nOne of them was placed under state guardianship because she abused the ER services and staff so badly. She wasn't allowed to request ER transport, it could only be done by the medical staff supervising her care.\n\nBeing native probably works against you because medical staff will have developed perceptions and biases from their previous encounters with Native Americans.\n\nWe're all idiots on this planet.
The more people entertained by him allows him to earn more $ through advertising and publicity gigs and with more money he gains more power to project his idiocy.
Hey, they can just glue the nerve ending together with a paste of stem cells and presto.
Anyone who expected HOTS to pull a significant number of existing MOBA players early on is an idiot. DOTA and LoL players are locked in tight.\n\nStrategy is to bring new players and blizzard fans on board initially and once they have a community to build out an esports league to bring in the more competitive gamers and players from other MOBAS.
Lining is still strong. Pokey as a mofo. Pokes like a nuke.
SAD!
Because giving him attention gives him power. Angry scared idiots shouldnt have power.
I understand the logic there, but to be fair I almost prefer ripping the bandaid off all at once rather than by increments. No matter who won the actual election, the real winners would always have been the billionaire shareholders of Goldman Sachs. \n\nThe obvious criminality of this new administration is galvanizing a broad base to action in exactly the sort of way Obama's or Clinton's mealy-mouthed neoliberalism could never have done.
I've always found that particular bit of rhetoric to be telling. \n\nWhy do Republicans think it costs so much money to protest? Because they couldn't have thrown the Tea Paty without that Koch cash. 
What's your definition of "free market"?
http://bitcoinist.com/interview-libretaxi-free-uber-lyft/\n\n>Bitcoinist: Is LibreTaxi decentralized? Or does the app store any funds and information from the user?\n\n>RP: It is centralized.
>No, it just means I don't want my words twisted.\n\nWhat words? Your definition of "free market" is so loose that it could be applied to China's economy... 
OMG, I've been waiting for Retroshare to catch on. Will have to reinstall it when I get home so I can share my cert with you guys\n
>So in 1602, the Dutch government allowed the creation of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, “United East India Company.”\n\nPretty sure I mentioned that part.  "basically everywhere except in the Netherlands where the government supported it's monopoly."\n\n>VOC ships were heavily armed and empowered as governmental proxies to declare war, hire troops, establish colonies and mete out justice in whatever guise was most expeditious to maximizing profits\n\nI'm sure that did wonders for their legality outside of Dutch territorial waters~\n\nBut yeah, I'd like to how how you think a Dutch-supported monopoly somehow stopped being a monopoly when they operated in other countries like England where they controlled more than 95% of the Asian spice trade. 
How Capitalist~
Right?\n\nWhat has happened to the Republican party?
Way to move those goalposts. First I had to imagine a show with a white supremacist radio host, now I have to imagine it's on a respectable platform? =3
You're going to have to define your use of "Conservatism", then. Because you obviously aren't using the common definition: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism\n\n>Conservatism as a political and social philosophy promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization. Conservatives seek to preserve institutions like the Church, monarchy and the social hierarchy, as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity.
I haven't noticed any issues on my OnePlus One using the nightly release from January 30th (aside from having to whitelist the Pebble app from PrivacyGuard to keep the phone from crashing when searching for bluetooth devices with which to connect). 
Seriously? Please go read Wikipedia's article on Conservatism, you've got it backwards. \n\nThe American Libertarian party is the opposite of fiscally conservative. Rather than retaining traditional institutions like the Federal Exchange, they would dismantle them entirely. \n\nThough you might be thinking of "American Conservatism", which is a very different political philosophy from traditional Conservatism:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States\n\n>American Conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the United States that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for Judeo-Christian values, economic liberalism, anti-communism, advocacy of American exceptionalism, and a defense of Western culture from perceived threats posed by "creeping socialism", moral relativism, multiculturalism, and liberal internationalism. Liberty is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the free market, limiting the size and scope of government, and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.
If he isn't being The President, then he's on vacation from being The President. 
If you could draw a distinct line between the two I'd be amazed. 
Republicans only think that protesting costs money because they wouldn't have thrown a Tea Party without that Koch Cash. \n\nThis gambit is classic conservative projection~
That's my understanding, too. Apparently the app is called [Wallpaper Engine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/). 
I think its important to learn about the different kinds of leftist political theory. That way you learn how Anarcho-Syndicalists and Social Libertarians are almost synonymous when compared to Trotskyites or Marxist-Leninists. Its not really tearing down one to compare and contrast so long as we all pull together where it counts.
You don't seem like much of anything from where I'm standing... 
Not-voting is an acceptable response if there's nobody worth voting for. \n\nIf Democrats wanted to win, they wouldn't have run Clinton. 
Self-hating right-wing homosexual hypocrites aren't a new thing and Milo's mom might be Jewish but he himself is a practicing Catholic. \n\n

What's wrong with the winner winning the election?\n\n>The presidential pendulum swung one way and it will swing the other way next, just as it always has, whining about the "weird system" because your team lost is pathetic.  \n\nHe said, as if this "weird system" ever favored Democrats.
I call it American Libertarianism just to make sure there's no confusion.
>it doesn't matter because as an employee you are obligated to notify your employer if you will be missing work.\n\nAs an employer, you're obligated to provide your employees with a living wage. \n\nI think one of these obligations being broken is a whole heck of a lot worse than the other. 
I'd love for someone to disprove it~
>since I'm talking about American politics and American political parties, I'm talking about American definitions of conservatism\n\nImprecise usage of language like this is how we got to the point where "Literally" also means "Figuratively".\n\n"Conservatives" don't advocate for destroying our nation's institutions (like the Departments of Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, etc) but "American Conservatives" do. Don't you see how that devalues the term "Conservative"?
Nah, Windows hasn't had native support for animated backgrounds since they realized ActiveX was a huge security fuckup. 
>Edit: If you are taking this literally or too seriously, stop. \n\nIf you don't want people to take you seriously and literally, mark your sarcasm. Poe's Law makes fools out of us all~
Its neither unnecessary nor random, it provides the justification for the right to bear arms. \n\nI.E., if people couldn't own guns, how would neighborhood communist self-defense committees develop the skills they need to smash the bourgeoisie?
>I actually do think that republicans will impeach him. \n\nIf that was something they actually wanted, they could have started doing it already. \n\n>I think congressional republicans are going to give him enough rope to hang himself then will get him out of office.\n\nI.E., "He'll be president so long as he signs our bills and only alienates 2/3rds of the population."
>>Backing out of TPP and renegotiating NAFTA would NEVER happen under a [mainstream] republican.\n\n>Nobody ever said that everyone inside a giant political party had the same exact views.\n\nTrump is president now, your argument that he isn't a "mainstream Republican" is specious. He represents what the Republican voter wants, and thus he represents the party as a whole. It doesn't get much more "Mainstream" than literally leading the party as President.\n\n>Is this a troll or are you genuinely mentally handicapped?\n\nDid you manage to miss the sarcasm tags on both of those posts? 
I had to google that name, and frankly I'm more offended that you'd associate me with someone so liberal than the implication that I'd suck a stranger's dick~ 
Praytell, please do explain the difference and why you think its relevant here~
>No, the poster above asked for a source of my claim so they could trash it as non-credible.\n\nEither you knew that the source you got that idea from isn't credible, or you didn't know that and you just assumed you knew what my intentions were.\n\nSo which is it, are you a lying asshole or an ignorant asshole? \n\n
So this bug's been posted to the official JIRA at https://jira.lineageos.org/browse/BUGBASH-17 and it looks to be somehow related to the Pebble app.

LOL, where do you get your definitions?  \n\nhttps://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fascism\n\n>Fascism (Noun)\n\n>1 An authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.\n\n>1.1 (in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practices\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism\n\n>1 often capitalized :  a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition\n\n>2 a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism\n\n>Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum.\n\nAntifascists don't get to decide who "Fascists" are. Lexicographers do.

>Why would it need a justification if the amendment itself is supreme law?  \n\nThe Constitution is a shit pile of code with terrible documentation. Apparently they felt the need to make the amendment self-explanatory for the benefit of folks like you.\n\n>This isn't a regular law which is being written to pass Constitutional Scrutiny, but the Constitution itself.

I'd love to know how you would justify that assertion, but it clearly isn't central to your argument. \n\n>Umberto Eco\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco\n\nIsn't it weird where your 14 points look different than these 14 points?\n\nI'd like to how you think the following can apply to antifascists, but not to the fascists they scrap with:\n\n>"The Rejection of modernism", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.\n\n>"Disagreement Is Treason" – Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.\n\n>"Fear of Difference", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.\n\n>"Obsession with a Plot" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society (such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and well-doings; see also anti-Semitism). Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.\n\n>Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as "at the same time too strong and too weak." On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.\n\n>"Contempt for the Weak", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.\n\n>"Machismo", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold "both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality."\n\n>"Selective Populism" – The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of "no longer represent[ing] the Voice of the People."\n\nSo there's all that.\n\n>Using this definition, perhaps it can become clear why so many people perceive a "fascist-ness" to these demonstrators. \n\nYeah, the American Liberals' sense of moral equivalency.\n\n>Fascism was a brand-new child; a product specifically of the 20th century. \n\nSure, the specific details of the implementation differ from other examples, but totalitarianism's various forms have existed since time immemorial. Fascism as a political system isn't anything new, it's just another kind of dictatorship. \n\n

Probably not, 'cause this poster is a response to:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism\n\nNoam Chomsky has a [famous essay](http://www.spectrezine.org/global/chomsky.htm) written in response to the Black Book of Communism, wherein he applies to capitalism the same methods by which the Black Book arrived at it's figures:\n\n>Overcoming amnesia, suppose we now apply the methodology of the Black Book and its reviewers to the full story, not just the doctrinally acceptable half. We therefore conclude that in India the democratic capitalist "experiment" since 1947 has caused more deaths than in the entire history of the "colossal, wholly failed...experiment" of Communism everywhere since 1917: over 100 million deaths by 1979, tens of millions more since, in India alone.

Level IV plates might be able to stand up to pistol-calibre fire for an extended period, but they cover a relatively small portion of the body and for the cost of a single armor plate and carrier you could afford to arm an irregular with a 9mm HiPoint Carbine and still have enough funding left over for a few magazines and two or three hundred rounds of ammunition. \n\nThere is something to be said for the relative ineffectuality of an untrained rabble, but as America's experiences in the middle east have taught, one shouldn't underestimate the tenacity and resourcefulness of rebels.

You obviously aren't talking about the Anarcho-Capitalist "Libertarian Party", right? 
>Why is this exclusive to liberals? I really would not consider myself a liberal\n\nThen perhaps you have an ahistorical idea of what a Liberal is: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States\n\n>>Liberalism in the United States is a broad political philosophy centered on the unalienable rights of the individual. The fundamental liberal ideals of ***freedom of speech***, freedom of the press, freedom of religion for all belief systems, and the separation of church and state, right to due process, and equality under the law are widely accepted as a common foundation across the spectrum of liberal thought.\n\nhttp://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/26/14369388/richard-spencer-punched-alt-right-trump\n\n>>This gets to a broader point about how much of liberalism is concentrated on keeping a specific kind of social order — one that’s focused on peaceful conversation and free speech even if it means talking with people with frankly abhorrent views. As Atlantic writer Vann Newkirk explained, ***“much of [liberalism] clearly favors law, order, and a suspension of disruption first, and then progress second.”***\n\n>>But fascists and other right-wing extremists can take advantage of this — because the idea that everyone deserves a voice means that fascists deserve a voice too, even if it helps legitimize views in the mainstream that are supposed to be intolerable.\n\nMartin Luther King users the term "Moderate", but it means essentially the same thing in this day and age: https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html\n\n>>I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that \nthe Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but ***the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice***; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\nIn essence, the modern American Liberal is very much like the Moderate German of the late 1920's and early 1930's. Opposed to fascism, but more willing to abide by it than to resist it. \n\n>I think we may consider the downfall of western society to be quite different things here- I'd like your take. \n\nI don't think that the form of said downfall is relevant to the hypothetical question as to whether one would support the "free speech" of those that conspire towards it. \n\n>I consider muslims or communists being able to dramatically effect a western government(to say, make a law mostly exclusive to their or similar ideologies) to be the downfall of western society. And a lot of other things too, which can be achieved democratically and without, say, a terrorist attack.\n\nThat's why I was deliberately vague about the form of said downfall, because in the end it doesn't matter if the society was destroyed by the exploitation of a "terrorist attack" like the Reichstag Fire in Germany or if it was democratically chosen like Mussolini's Fascist Party in Italy. The question is whether or not you support the right of individuals to advocate, recruit, and organize towards that downfall.  \n\n>The opinion of a white nationalist who possibly wants ethnic genocide.\n\nJust "possibly"?\n\n>I'm not sure what your point is. Am I supposed to consider that to be too horrible of an opinion not to be included in freedom of speech? Because I don't.\n\nThe point is that I'm asking you to consider the grey area between "Constitutionally-protected free speech" and "Incitement" or "Fighting Words", and how the alt-right exploits that grey zone to lawfully advocate for a pogrom of white nationalism with [dog-whistle references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics) in support of genocide:\n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0\n\n
>>I find it amusing that you have such a maximalist ideal regarding Freedom of Speech.

>Freedom to start, own and sell businesses, hire people to work for you, make money, sell and buy goods and services in a market where prices are mostly determined by supply and demand.\n\nThat's not a "free" market, that's any market economy. \n\nWhat is it that you think differentiates a market from a free market?

The Poster mentions what it is a response to, "[The Black Book of Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism)"\n\nIn that book, the authors struggle valiantly to build a case whereby "Communism" is responsible for essentially all deaths in Russia, China, and other nominally "Communist" nations.  \n\nThis poster merely applies the same methodology to estimating the death toll under "Capitalism". I.E., failing to provide healthcare services to your population is the same thing as deliberately-orchestrated murder.

The conservatives are going to go crazy. I’m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it’s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We’re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks."\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism#Economics\n\n>Generally speaking, Nazi theorists and politicians blamed Germany’s previous economic failures on political causes like the influence of Marxism on the workforce, the sinister and exploitative machinations of what they called ***international Jewry***, and the vindictiveness of the western political leaders' war reparation demands. Instead of traditional economic incentives, the Nazis offered solutions of a political nature, such as **the elimination of organised labour groups**, rearmament (in contravention of the Versailles Treaty), and **biological politics**. Various **work programs designed to establish full-employment*** for the German population were instituted once the Nazis seized full national power. Hitler encouraged nationally supported projects like the construction of the Autobahn, the introduction of an affordable people’s car (Volkswagen) and later, the Nazis bolstered the economy through the business and employment generated by military rearmament. Not only did the Nazis benefit early in the regime's existence from the first post-Depression economic upswing, their public works projects, job-procurement program, and subsidised home repair program reduced unemployment by as much as 40 percent in one year, a development which tempered the unfavourable psychological climate caused by the earlier economic crisis and encouraged Germans to march in step with the regime.\n\nSo if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and acts like a duck, how am I still supposed to imagine it isn't a duck?

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person).

That still doesn't explain why the quantity is relevant. Do you think a single thousand page regulation causes more, or less inefficiency than ten single page regulations? What if one of them is modifying an existing regulation to make it less onerous, or even remove it all together?
Wow, really. All the links in that story were useless.
And at least one not-angry libertarians.

Sounds like larger and faster premium increases to me, or insurance companies going out of business. Not sure how those are good things, unless he's also let up on the requirement of insurance companies to sell to everyone?

No one will ever feel left out in an ass kicking contest again.
Okay, that makes sense. One other thing I don't understand though. Wouldn't 1187 and Trump's order both violate the non discrimination section of 1152?
Sometimes a plea bargain isn't any kind of bargain at all.
I can't tell if you're serious or not, but this might be the most amazing thing I've read either way.
If you wanted to get open carry outlawed in your state, that's the way you do it.
Yeah, that'd be expanding into your kitchen, though. Analogy wise, I don't think there is a way to explain the concept of nothing, and definitely not at an ELI5 level.

Ah, my bad. Sorry!
I know you're joking, but depending on his state all he'd have to do is have the police come out and report on it, and he'd be able to take it home and eat it. That's quite a few "free" meals (not counting repair bills), and no hunting license required.
I helped my sister clean out her mother-in-law's house, which she had been letting her grandson stay in with his girlfriend and their daughter. It was located in a little neighborhood in Detroit called Delray.\n\n* They had several large dogs. They didn't let them out, or clean up after them. There was a thick layer of poop on the floor of every room of every floor.\n\n\n\n\n* They had a waterbed that had sprung a leak which they did nothing about. Yes, that room had been covered in poop as well. This resulted in a sewage waterfall in the basement.\n\n\n\n\n* There was a spore, mold, and fungus collection in the fridge that would have made Egon jealous.\n\n\n\n\n* The girlfriend was "allergic to soap." So the laundry never got done. They just threw it down the basement stairs. By the time we got there it had piled so deep the bottom layer was embedded in the concrete floor. We named the rats that lived in it George and Gracie.\n\n\n\n\nThere was an upside though. Some Jehovah's Wittnesses tried to come to the door while we were in the midst of pushing waterbed sewage out the front door with a shovel.  They turned visibly green about halfway to the door, and turned and ran. :)\n

Are we talking about the same Obama? The guy that lost more court cases than any other President?
I agree. It's just a commentary on the crickets I hear every time Trump does something that Obama got reamed for.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's made executive orders great again, too.
I never thought I'd say this, but Ashton Kutcher.
I just feel the need to bring up how many times the Supreme Court has found the practice to be, in fact, constitutional. The Bennis (1996) and Kaley (2014) decisions being the two most recent that I can think of off the top of my head, but there's precedent for it going back to at least the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\n\nBecause it's a civil in rem proceeding, the fourth doesn't apply. Your property doesn't have that right, but you do. Yes, I know how twisted that sounds.\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth and fourteenth don't apply because you have access to the courts to have your property returned. In a civil suit. In which you're the plantiff. The constitution is pretty specific about you having the right to due process, it quite a bit less so on what due process actually *is.*\n\n\n\n\nSo, no, not trolling.
I wonder if they wouldn't just call it tinder.

Just for the record, the suburbs are where Detroit keeps most of its hotels and airports.
Maybe that's what's confusing me. The waivers let you get by without a visa or even a valid passport. If we have that little trust in documentation from those specific countries, why require it? And how does the requirement for the same documents nearly everyone has to provide anyway equate to anything Trump is doing?
"Such a beautiful place it is, to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend, Harry Potter."
Your emotions are your body's built in instructions for how to deal with life. In other animals we would call them instincts, they evolved to push us toward certain behaviors in certain situations, although they don't dominate our decision making to the extent they do other animals, and they don't always work quite right. \n\n\n\nHappiness and sadness are a little different from the other emotions like fear (Run away! Stay safe!) and love (Mate! Make friends!), in that they are your internal reward and punishment system. Winning the goals of your other emotions makes you happy, losing them makes you sad, which drives you to do more of the happy stuff and minimize the sad stuff. The sadness you feel when someone you care about dies is just that, loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr I could be completely wrong.

That's not how it was portrayed by Trump, either. It's one of the reasons his EO is getting hit with all these injunctions.

America knew exactly what Trump was months before the election. A large part of it still voted for him.\n\n\nThey aren't good enough to not approve of him even after Trump proves he is exactly what he says he is.
There's no telling what is likely. He made the EO without consulting most of his staff. Anything could happen.
Never overestimate America
read https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ssarq/this_is_the_coretta_scott_king_letter_that/ddhjaw1/\n\nYou don't need it spelled out to you.
I don't care what your experience is. It has no bearing on the statement. I don't know what I'm talking about? Tell me about how you're going to overthrow the government with AR-15s. If the toddler's argument is superior to the adults, well...\n\nIf I'm reading what you're saying correctly, you've taken an argument against the concept of "Militia to defeat the government" and changed it to "owning guns at all." \n\n\nIf that's true, that's explicitly what you accuse me of, moving goalposts. I say that there is already limitations on the potential of weapons people are allowed to have. Therefore, a "Militia to defeat the government" is impossible. That does not mean take away all guns. I cite "right to effective self defense" in a different argument in this thread, actually.\n\n\nUnless your argument is the idea that if anything gets banned, it's a slippery slope to no guns, no self defense? If that's your argument, you're better off arguing for civilians to be allowed to own weapons that actually make a difference, because those are already explicit bans.
No proof, like the analysis done by 538 saying that it absolutely did cost her the election?\n\nI guess professional opinion isn't good enough. There's no proof gravity is real, either.
My assertion is that using "overthrowing the US" as a reason to support is invalid. You're trying to disprove my assertion by creating a scenario where armed civilians matter in overthrowing the US government, with supporting ideas from scenarios that aren't the same, and shifted goalposts.\n\nYour "hole punching" theory relies on the idea that the government becomes clearly and obviously tyrannical overnight. Sure, let's assume that happens. Then military in-fighting happens. At this point, the arms of the citizens are completely irrelevant, given that they are already limited. The real agents in the conflict would be military, and if one side wins quickly the other is already beaten. In the case that the military breaks up and begins a civil war, maybe your one extra assault rifle might contribute to the effort, if they for some reason were running out of those. Keep in mind this is all under the assumption that the government very obviously becomes "evil." There are countless examples of modern military crackdowns. It is insidious, and those that rebel are terrorists. I suppose in that far more realistic scenario, you can petition Russia and maybe China (or whatever other agents are interested in destabilizing the US...) for actual supplies, just like Afghanistan and Vietnam. At this point, again, the level of arms in America stops mattering. And then what, you became successful Guerrilla forces? And overthrow America from within? They "succeeded (if you can say that much)" in Afghanistan and Vietnam because America went home. That is not the case in this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe right to bear arms being infringed is your interpretation. It isn't simple to interpret those rights in modern day, which is why we have the supreme court, where interpretations change. As of current interpretation, and the current set of laws, the Second Amendment is limited. Because it is limited, it has generally no bearing on overthrowing a government, as the level arms you can attain given said limits is trivial compared to those of the actual agents involved. Therefore, as of current, it has no bearing in an argument, unless you preface it with the idea like yours that "every single possible arm should be allowed, and therefore this one should too." You're free to believe that, but that is not the argument.\n\n\n\n>Anyone that believes in the democratic society we have here in the US would value the right to bear arms. Without a way to ensure you are able to exercise your rights, they are in jeopardy of being taken away.\n\nIrrelevant to the argument, but still- consider that many people and many other countries VALUE the right, but generally wish to restrict/or have already restricted it because of the costs of that right.\n
They look like short necked serpentis\n\nIt'd be real cool if we could get more rare pics out of the artbook!
The language is hyperbolic on purpose, but it's true from the viewpoint of technology, at least. America is the greatest in history in that regard because it exists right now.
When your argument is "I want to be an inconsequential terrorist someday" You don't have any room to call other arguments weak.\n\n\nYour best argument is "I like guns." Stick with it.
63 is translated on 4chan too
Training still restricts ownership, since some people cannot pass. Same with a driver's license.\n\n\nYou come off with someone who doesn't know how to argue and has the worldview of a clam. But that's not relevant. I'm sorry I took the time to actually consider your words and not barf out a statement that completely ignores the argument, but it's done now. You're welcome.
The incredible greed is appreciated
I've been looking into it. Is that fundamental reason written into the amendment? \n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Does-the-2nd-amendment-of-the-U-S-Constitution-says-that-citizens-have-the-right-to-use-guns-to-fight-the-government-if-they-see-themselves-as-defending-their-freedom-Re-Cliven-Bundy-Mik\n\nAnd other places say similar.\n\nIf it isn't written in, it's interpretation. 
Talk about some of those excellent decisions. The only one that seems decent has been Mattis so far, and Trump isn't even consulting the man for this EO.

The anti-trump news you're bombarded with is generally exactly what he said or did. The reason you struggle to find a defense except inside a cult? Because the defense is weak to non-existant.\n\nThe idea that r/politics and r/the_donald are on the same level is also ridiculous. I understand your message, but it's an uninformed opinion. r/t_d is a cult subreddit of the worst, explicit racists and fascists among them.

You don't know what a straw man is, do you?\n\nTerrorism fails to overthrow a country of the potential of the US. I thought I stated that clearly enough, but now I'm spelling it out. \n\n\nYou're defending it with the Revolutionary war, which at the very premise of this argument was disqualified because AGAIN, technology has moved on. \n\n\nEven more on the point, Afghan "fighters" have hardly succeeded at what you state is their goal, have they?\n\nThe same taking place in America, where the country would invest full resources, would make the goal even less possible.\n\n\nYou didn't understand the basic idea, and you've deflected it as trolling. Being immune to ideas that are different from yours, or don't understand, is a foolish way to persist.\n\n\n\nFor our future's sake, I hope you read up on basic reasoning and understand that the future and the past are not the same thing.

Fuck this idea. People voted for who they wanted to vote for in the primary.

>Firstly, no one is claiming they are going to overthrow anything.\n\nRead the comment chain. That is where the argument went. \n\n>But to answer the question, through guerrilla/attrition warfare.\n\nRight. That will overthrow the most powerful country in the world from within it's own borders. With rifles.\n\n>Your mental gymnastics are difficult to follow.\n\nI'm glad we're at the ad homiem stage already. Makes this easier. Either that, or there's a severe lack of understanding going on, which makes it harder.\n\n>Let's take the Amendment apart and address everything. I am a Marine, so I have crayons to help draw it out for you.\n\nThank you for your crayon explanation of the second amendment, I'll put it on the fridge next to the others. It's very nice. \n\nThank you also for ignoring the point- That your rights to arms are already infringed. There already are lines between what you can and cannot have. Those lines prevent your militia from overthrowing a tyrannical government. Hence the line of the argument leading straight to domestic terrorism, that you state no one is claiming.\n\n>Arms= firearms, explosives, nuclear weapons, artillery, indirect fire weapons, aircrafts, and anything else the military uses to fight with\n\nShow me your nuke, please. The one that will not be limited, restricted, regulated or inhibited. Your interpretation is invalid in the eyes of the law. The excuse "the second amendment lets me have any weapon so I win" doesn't work anymore. It hasn't since we advanced past muskets. \n\n\n
She and several other characters were way too obsessed with style. There was no point to announcing that Wick is a loose end, for example. And Santiago should have been running, and not being pretentious all the time. And sumo guy did not need to arm bar John. Shoot first.\n\n\nNot that that's a flaw to the movie, or anything. I think it's clear that these characters are purposefully like that. Probably for the same reason serial killers leave hints.
Another card like Hallow grovekeeper that just hardcounters certain strategies. I'm not a fan of the design at all- hard counters don't need to exist. This one is even more prevalent because it has utility outside of it's hard counter target.

The only solution for the current system of government is for the other side to vote down party line better, since there are more of them. They can't let anything deflate their vote.
If anyone looked at Clinton's policies you'd see that she was close to Bernie. If anything, she had much more detailed and likely better policy, except on the point of what to do with ACA (which is debatable.) \n\n\nIf she's a bad candidate by your metric, there will never be anyone good enough for you.
Your logic doesn't even make sense. You're implying Bannon's not a white nationalist because people ALSO say he's anti-Semite, and if he's not one(which is entirely dependent on the idea that Trump knows or cares) he's not the other?\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. 
that you think what I said in any way supports trump says things about you.

I can't tell if you're trying to gaslight me or something. Fake news has an explicit definition. A quick search immediately proves you wrong. Stop bastardizing the term.
I dunno about his old attacks, but I think the difference is if Trump is attacking something the government interacts with or not. Contractors like Boeing can be hurt, for example.
Don't forget uninformed, even though at this point those people have less and less excuses...

The misunderstanding is what "Moderates" are. Democrats, by the standards of most other first world countries, ARE moderates.
>basically only be held by somebody who just doesn't pay attention to her career and campaigns.\n\nSo the mass voting base, who will end up thinking the same thing, because it already happened to Clinton.\n\nI seriously doubt the Democratic party is willing to risk 2020. It's a deep shame, but I don't think it'll be a woman running. There's too much risk.\n
For that to happen, a swath of republican voters are going to need to break from their ingrained positions, which doesn't seem likely.
There's a shocking amount of people who aren't taking a second to think "maybe it's for humor"
So what do you think they should do, play just as dirty? Problem is democratic voters actually care about morals.\n\nUltimately it's the voter bases that are different. Democrats will always be crippled by that.
No, he wouldn't be easier to beat. Trump got normal, if depressed numbers. The issue was in certain areas people just didn't turn out for Clinton.

They aren't wrong, they just have... a misguided higher expectation of the American public. It's sad, but these strategies aren't simple to defeat.
Bernie lost because 3 million people in the democratic party preferred Clinton. There was certainly bias, but the much claimed "rigging" came when Bernie was expected to step down after mathematically losing already. \n\nMaybe he could have won if he was a democrat earlier. Maybe he could have won if independants could vote in democratic primaries. But the rules were in place already, and wouldn't change in the middle of the process, and he lost. \n\n\nAnd he endorsed Clinton because she was the best choice, for him and his policies. Nothing else to it.\n\n\nThat so many people can't just accept that their perfect candidate wasn't an option and that they should choose their strictly next best option is a shame.
In a sample size of one, .5% can and does happen, you realize.
It is gaslighting to try to convince me that wrong things are facts. At least try with terms that aren't clearly defined.
Wow, did not know Trela got gud again
Right, that's what I thought. I guess you can do what Superhot VR does and teleport the player in a psuedo onrails fashion? But that's about it, really.
you're wrong, but your argument doesn't have enough substance to nail down and trivially prove wrong.
Metamorphosis is fine as is. It just isn't the correct meta for it.\n\nUnstable Leviathan should never be too good, but maybe not letting it hit itself with the effect would be fine.\n\nDreadnaught would be fine as a 5 mana card, possibly with 1 less health.\n\nVisionar needs a better starting statline, though I hesitate to make anything that scales as fast as Visionar too good.
Silencer tech has improved, I think? I just assumed technology was slightly more advanced in the movie since I doubt bulletproof suits are a thing either.
This is sorta accurate, but it's more that the centrist believes in sexism, and understands how powerful it is, and really, really doesn't want to lose again.
That you and people like you care so much about how people are employed and not their actual results is part of the issue.\n\n\nHillary and Warren vote the same the vast majority of the time.
Again with the false equivilency bullshit. One option was obviously better than the other, and many of our fellow citizens failed to see that.\n\n\nThat being said, it is(hopefully) still a free country. They were never on the hook for anything. \n\nThere's nothing worth saying to them. They're generally unconvincable. Those few who realized Trump is already fucking them will probably turn around and vote for him again. They aren't enemies. They're just obstacles.\n\n\n Democrats can only hope to reach those who didn't turn out. 
I saved a post about this, actually! \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/5t1u89/america_gettin_curved/ddjy4mx/\n\nBPT is wonderful sometimes
BC's critical flaw is that it abuses friendship tropes without properly developing the basis for them. It's never going to stop doing that.
Demonizing Trump voters will at least make it clear what people think of them, publicly and privately.  It's the same logic behind shaming neo-nazis.
That you buy into this mostly debunked narrative so long after the election is a showing of how deep the roots go.
Green paper and a camera(does it have to be good?) seem to be the only strict requirements above already having a vive.
She wasn't unpopular at the start of the campaign. It was disgustingly easy to erode support. \n\n"Shitty pick?" She was literally the person who overwhelmingly won the primary. Could Bernie have won instead? It's possible. But so would Clinton, had Comey not dropped an empty letter killing her polling margins by factors of 10%.\n\n\nAnd that is why the fault is ultimately the voter's. Who CARES if you aren't excited by your candidate. WHO CARES about empty scandals. VOTE ANYWAY. VOTE FOR THE BEST CANDIDATE WHO IS A REAL OPTION. Otherwise, when you end up with Trump, don't blame anyone else. You're the one who let him in.\n\nAnd you voted third party? I hope you didn't do it anywhere it mattered.
he's on vacation. \n\n\nprobably forever.
It does. Unfortunately, you can't expect republicans to try to make elections more fair.
You're allowed to, through proper regulations, put up a satellite. You are not allowed to own a nuke.\n\n\nThe point is that it's already limited in this day and age. Saying you need your shotgun to fight the government is a laughable reason.\n\n\nThe core holding in D.C. v. Heller is that the Second Amendment is an individual right intimately tied to the natural right of self-defense. You aren't overthrowing anyone in self defense.
I frequent r/politics, and haven't seen what you're talking about. Prove your point with sources.\n\n\nI'm already skeptical, because the idea of a north korean propaganda news site is amusing at best.
The ship sailed, and Bernie lost the Primary by more than 3 million votes. If you read the emails, they're generally after Bernie was eliminated mathematically. Obviously the DNC's going to try to consolidate support after it is no longer a race. It wasn't perfectly neutral, but there was very little that would overcome the massive difference in the primary.\n\n\nHe lost, accepted it, and threw his support in behind Hillary.\n\n\nShould have voted for the candidate Bernie endorsed. Anything less is spitting on his efforts. That's the lesson it seems like a lot of people are failing to take from this. Not everything is going to be perfect every time. You should still choose your best option, not piss and moan and attack the people who are the closest thing to your allies until you get your way- because at that rate, you'll NEVER have your way.
Better voting system, fixed gerrymandering, better education. Make the vote as good as possible, so that the government best represents the people, and make the people better.
Voters are the only ones with power. They let a letter full of nothing stop them from preventing that "pussygrabbing" candidate. \n\n\nPeople need to blame themselves. They're the only thing they can rely on to ultimately make the right choice. 
They don't.  Only republicans do. Clinton won, and she was closer to the center than Sanders.
I'd ask you to stop literally lying, but I know you won't. Hope that makes you happy.
I never said that corporations have personhood. That's not at issue.\n\nYou're basically saying that if an entity (not person) - e.g. a glee club, a village, a city, or a corporation - has more stuff than you (an abundance), then it's OK to take from them?
Dear god. We must stop the discipline. For the sake of the noses!
Love your edit additions. They capture the nature of reddit so perfectly.
Hey I really appreciate your earnestness in explaining his system and the theory behind it to me.\n\nJust so you know though, some of these physics terms aren't being used properly...for example received light shouldn't be measured per cubic meter. It should be by squared meter. Light doesn't fall onto volumes. It falls onto areas. This might just be a miscommunication though.\n\nI'll watch those videos so I can see what he says himself. It's an interesting claim he's making, and I'm not ruling it out...yet.\n\nThanks again.
Haha. Well at least you're wearing pants.\n\nTo date, my freetheundies campaign has yet to gain traction.
Two wrongs don't make a right?\n\nDo you think it's OK for cops to confiscate drug money to buy themselves Corvettes?
My silver tabby went missing in the first storm last week. He's usually really flighty and stays away from people, and previously he's been known to stay out for a couple of nights during wet weather.\n\nIs there something about cats leaving "home" during rain storms?\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say your cat is OK, but he's doing his own thing right now. Maybe enjoying someone else's heated living room. Do hope you figure out where he is though.
Those batteries are next to the service desk because certain people think it's OK to steal them.\n\n(Btw, to supplement our previous sock talk, you should get an oil lantern if you need light. I've been using it during the blackouts. About $6 for the lantern, and $4 for a bottle of oil that seems to last forever.)
It sounds like you might have something important or insightful to say, but your post is somewhat obscure and lacking in explanation and details. Could you possibly elaborate on what you're saying? It could be of benefit to everyone here.
What happens when the drone's radio signal fails, which is a good possibility given the extended range, and the drone decides to ascend to 1000' all on its own?
The computer destruction is a possible strawman decoy. The real reason is that:\n\n1) Comet Ping Pong was getting tons of bad press. A violent attack against them allows them to play to victim card.\n\n2) It immediately casts any Piizagate activists as extremists and armed terrorists which discredits the entire movement.\n\nI'm just answering your question as to why a "crisis actor" might have been hired. Not whether this may actually be true or not.
Based on your comment, I just realized something. The workplace now values accredited authority over an individual's talent of skill. In other words, it's become more important to have a piece of paper that says you know something than to show that you have the capacity and/or desire to learn what is required.\n\nWhat this does is shift control of "employability" away from the individual and gives it to institutions. This strengthens indoctrination and the perceived need for those institutionalized authorities.
Hiking's good for anxiety. Nature and sun, etc.\n\nIf you go on a nice weekend, there should be a bunch of people out there, too. It's a popular hike...unless your anxiety is about people?\n\nAnyway, it's hot and dry out there, so try it on a cooler day. You also don't have to hike all the way out. Lots of people will just make it to the river for a picnic or a little splash in the water.
To my knowledge, no green card holders were ever refused entry. Some were detained or harassed and some decided not to board, but that is much different from being refused entry.\n\n>A senior Department of Homeland Security official told CNN...that no legal green card holders have been denied entry, but Trump's order has made it more difficult to enter the United States.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-green-card-dual-citizens/\n\nBut in case this is wrong, where did you get information that green card holders were refused?
Get out of here with your "facts". Obama can do no wrong!
I didn't think people still used boomboxes. ;)\n\nI've got my trusty pocket radio here for the silent spells. It uses AA batteries - cheaper than D's though not as much "boom".
Wow, thanks for the rundown on rationalwiki. I've only encountered the site on a few occasions when searching on formal logic.\n\nCould definitely be spook run or at least encouraged. Sort of like Snopes for thinking people...or people who think they're thinking people.
I think the majority of sports are supposed to mimic the challenges you might face in life without the possibility of death part. For example, the marathon mimics a soldiers running between cities, except nobody dies if you don't make it in time. Rugby, football, basketball and lacrosse all mimic team hunting and warfare tactics. Baseball is all about throwing rocks, whacking things hard - good skills to have for hunting without anyone starving if you suck at it.\n\nBy this definition, Parkour isn't really a sport. It's basically creating a real life danger for no reason. No predator is chasing you, no game is getting away, no terrorist is going to set off a bomb if you don't jump over five rooftops in time. So it's basically life without the reason and motivation.
Ahh, now I know why you needed those D cells. ;)
Exactly. For example, I can decide to work at McDonald's or the Burger King across the street. Free market, baby!
Yeah, that's what I thought. Shouldn't they have just removed art that was from immigrants who are currently illegal residents? Because that's what the socio-political issue is actually about - despite what the media keeps saying.
This is part of the ongoing forum slide that's been executed over the past several months. I've noticed it myself.\n\nI'm still here. I just try to ignore the obviously irrelevant posts and comments. Granted this does not mean I ignore posts that disagree with my worldview, just the ones that don't have anything meaningful to say.
Hey, don't steal. It's not about what's fair or leveling the economic playing field against corporate giants. It's about respecting the wishes of other entities...*even* if they don't respect yours. It's the only way to evolve.
But what kind of drone wouldn't have that risk? Computer code and processors aren't infallible. A runaway scenario is always possible even on high end models.
So, um, that model he's showing in the news segment is made out of copper and PVC pipe and, I think, other plumbing parts?\n\nAnd setting aside all the "new science" that's he's claiming, the way this thing is supposed to make power is through "photo-voltaic cells"? Seriously? There are going to be mini-solar panels *right next to* the the little ball of light that's burning at, I assume, a temperature similar to that of the sun.\n\nAnd he's going to bother with photovoltaic conversion when such an amazing captive heat source could be used to power a steam turbine or something similar.
I'm really curious as to how you've got this all set up. So I understand, you charge fees based on your own schedule...not based on market rates? What kind of industry are you in? PM me if you don't want it too public. Or just decline to answer for privacy's sake.
Very good point. It'll be a nice challenge.
So the interesting thing is that some people think that mammoths may have existed when the Northern latitudes (where they're found) were much warmer than they are now.\n\nIf the climate warms up, it'll be like back to normal for them. Good timing for their resurrection.\n
> any idea how hard it was to find a boombox with external inputs in 2003?!\n\nHaha. I feel ya.\n\nSometimes it's nice to have dedicated tech. I had this boxy analog cassette tape boom box (although it was more what you'd call a "portable radio") that I loved to play while working in the basement.  And it had external inputs, of course.
Cool, never heard of Bardic humor before...I tried googling, but there doesn't seem to be much about it. Could you elaborate on what it is exactly?\n\n
Good to know that visa restrictions have no meaning then.

I didn't know this about Randi. Assuming for a moment that he is on the CIA payroll, it would totally slot in with his ongoing mission to debunk psychic phenomena.\n\nDon't want anyone thinking Project Stargate might have had real results.
Why have young kids hold drugs for you when you work the street corners?
I stopped drinking coke regularly years ago, but 5 oz sounds like a pretty appropriate serving actually. That's about when it starts getting too sweet.
Are you kidding? Any of those problems would totally ruin your chances at getting into medical school. No thank you.
Hahaha. So appropriate.\n\n(Sorry, French people. You make great wine!)
In the X-Men / Logan universe people are supposed to unrealistic abilities though. So having a super-kid is OK?
Oh I agree. Any kind of cat is a highly-refined killing machine, just scaled up or down.\n\nBut those chimps are terrifying as well. I think it's basically a brawn vs. finesse thing. Cats are quick and lethal, but somewhat fragile because of it. Chimps are like these brutal blocks of gristle and bone.\n\nI guess a chimp vs. leopard fight is going on my bucket list then.
If you haven't, try out high percentage or 100% wool socks. They don't get soaked down like cotton, and for me, they seems to stay "fresher" longer. i.e they don't stink like other materials.\n\nI've been using this brand, and they're great.\n\nhttps://www.rei.com/product/892864/pistil-everyday-merino-crew-socks-mens
I'd really like to see a chimp vs. leopard fight.
That's a lot of BBQ.
A mom saying that is what those 5 kids apparently needed.
Actually, it wasn't the Pepe memes I meant. I was referring more to the political cartoons and satirical images posted over there. Anyways, hope you post about the Bardic so I can understand it better.
I don't think you're crazy. It's the world that's crazy, and you just look funny by comparison.
I think "paranoid" implies that your fears are unfounded or delusional, not so much that you have a high level of fear. For example, when being stalked by a panther your might be incredibly fearful, but it wouldn't be appropriate to say that you're paranoid of being eaten.\n\nAt this point, they should just leave paranoia out of it.
This is a really interesting point. I've never thought of satire vs sarcasm in this way, but it really makes sense. Will be looking at the various forms of humor in a different light now. Thanks.
I guess people in this thread didn't see the news that the women are claiming they thought they were taking part in some kind of game show.\n\nInfo here:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/suspect-north-korea-killing-thought-she-was-taking-part-in-tv-prank-indonesia-siti-aisyah-police-kim-jong-nam
It's more about feels than understanding with them unfortunately. So a few might change, but the majority will remain under their veil of programmed righteous indignation.
Do you mean ugly on the outside, inside, or both?
I remember the the Sarah Jones death when it happened. Didn't realize there's all this press about it now.\n\nA completely foolish tragedy.
I think both you guys are actually making the same point...there must be some better solution than 100 foot wide sewer drains across the city.
This is an interesting case since unfinished receivers are legal for sale without an FFL. Likewise, building your own gun for private use is also legal.\n\nWhat this guy was apparently doing was "selling" the unfinished receivers and then providing a service where he would then "assist" the "builder" with the use of his CNC machine.\n\nHe got slammed for this because it was riding really close to the law. However, I wonder what the outcome would have been if he had separated the operation into two distinct entities. One company would sell the unfinished receiver with a CNC program on a flash drive, then customers would drive across town to a "CNC rental facility". They'd pop the flash drive into the CNC, a technicians watches to make sure they're doing it right, and the machine takes care of the rest.
Most of space is beyond our solar system so this clickbait title isn't really saying that much.
Interesting. That is a UK site too. Maybe the CIA didn't get around to changing it there yet?\n\nAlso the description at that site is so, so clear and simple. They even explain the "strong" and "weak" versions of the fallacy. And ironically (scarily?), the weak version is what is being used as the *definition* in the other wiki sites.\n\nThanks for finding this.\n\nI've never edited a public wiki. Was hoping someone more familiar with the process could do so.
I like me a good Rick and Morty, but a word of caution.\n\nIt seems to me that a person can very much get wrapped up in the "better" cartoons, anime, and graphic novels. And when so immersed, it will seem like the stories are all saying such deep, meaningful, and insightful things.\n\nKeep in mind that they aren't. They're basically shallower repackagings of deeper thoughts and insights from the greater universe of philosophy, literature, and fine arts. Because of the nature of what they are (media meant for passive consumption by primarily teens and young adults), they can't go into greater depths - although they will appear to be speaking with much authority and gravitas. \n\nDon't get me wrong. Cartoons and anime are a nice introduction to deeper thought, but they are not anything more than the beginning of a path.
This article and thread is in bad need of some context. Here it is.\n\nThis wasn't an "overturning of a law". It was congress disapproving a revision of existing environmental standards that are already in place for coal companies. The disapproval of the revision does not mean that coal companies will be dumping waste willy-nilly into streams and rivers as the article implies. \n\nHere is the congressional resolution regarding the disapproval:\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/38/text\n\nAnd here is a pdf of the rule that was disapproved:\n\nhttps://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-20/pdf/2016-29958.pdf\n\n\nI want to point out that increasing the restriction on coal companies could be an economic and political power play - not just a bunch of tree-huggers trying to save the world. Domestic coal mining decreases our reliance on foreign fuel sources and increases domestic employment. When coal output goes down, foreign oil imports could go up.\n\nIn any case, I'm not saying coal power is a good thing or that raping our environment to fuel or out-of-control population should be endorsed. I just want to establish some perspective.
Definitely couldn't hurt though, right?
[Exactly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP539XGDEgk)
Cartoons haven't really been my thing for a while, and it kept me from watching Rick and Morty sooner, but there's something delightfully twisted about it.\n\nYeah, I see your point about vegging out. Though it's not so much that I think cartoons are low bar, but that people will read, say, an acclaimed graphic novel and believe they've uncovered new depths of philosophical insight.
This is a very good point you bring up. Seems like it would end up boiling down to a Begging the Question fallacy.\n\nExperts are often correct in their conclusions...because experts are those people who have been determined to be often correct in their conclusions.\n\n\n\n
Thanks for this. I was going to dig into the history myself but hadn't gotten to it.
Why the downvotes? I think your comment is pretty on point.
You're not following the logic...I have rights, but the people I disagree with don't.
Yes, please do that.\n\nBtw, is this Bardic humor in any way similar to the "shit posts" seen in that Donald sub?
As far as I'm aware, there were two (unknowing?) accomplices directly involved, not a soccer team.\n\n
Perhaps a tie-in with this movie?\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103003/
I think there's something to channeling and past lives, but I'll just throw in this counter-explanation to keep things lively.\n\nPractically all of the world's languages have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years. During this time, a phonetic streamlining occurs (I think there's a term for this but I don't know it) where the combinations of vowels and consonants are optimized to create the lowest energy requirements for the vocal organs.\n\nBasically, whenever the mouth and throat are held in a particular configuration, certain series of sounds will be more easily produced than others. These low energy series tend to propagate as a language's common phrases.\n\nNow when a person speaks in tongues, they might form their mouth in a way foreign to their natural way of speaking, and this will produce foreign "low energy" configurations of phonemes simply based on the physicality of the speaking apparatus. Because a similar process has occurred in evolution of the world's languages, there is a reasonable possibility that some strings of phonemes will match.\n\nMore interestingly, the more ancient that language, the more time this optimization process has been at work. Thus it's actually more likely to find random low energy configurations that match ancient languages than younger ones. And this could explain why we hear reports of spoken ancient Sumerian more than 1970's jive.\n\n
Fine. I'll make an exception for Mr. Bond but only him.\n\nBtw, skateboarding originated as a way to practice surfing on dry land. And surfing was originally a Hawaiian islander sport. And for native Hawaiians, swimming and maneuvering in the ocean was a critical survival skill. So again we've got a sport originating as a means to practice life challenge skills without immediate threat of death - such as learning to swim during an actual tsunami.\n\nAs for BMX riding. You've got me there. Maybe a way to evade urban land sharks? I do know Baltimore gangs would use motorcross bikes and BMX's to evade police in the city. So there's that.
What. The. Shit.
So I'm purposefully not debating the physics behind it because if it is something new there wouldn't be a frame of reference to confirm or deny the phenomenon.\n\nBut using the internal logic of the system, if UV light is converted to *black body* radiation...black body radiation means that no (or very little) visible light is being produced. But photovoltaic cells typically operate in the visible spectrum. Why not just have the photovoltaics run off the UV then?\n\nAnd if there were a blackbody conversion...that's basically radiated heat which will contain a certain amount of energy. You can't get more energy out of it than whatever is radiating out. So how hot is this thing then? How much energy is coming out of it? If the "heat density" isn't that intense, then is it like a lightbulb? A tea kettle? That's not something you can run a house off of. 
Second that for LEDs. I grew up in the time when flashlights used those incandescent bulbs that were never bright enough and ran the batteries down after an hour. I also remember those 12V "brick" lanterns people used for "big" emergencies. With LEDs, flashlights finally work the way I think they should.
Haha. Touche.
Hadn't heard of the No True Scottsman fallacy before. That's a good one to know. Thanks.
Daly City it is then.
Excellent.
Rubber bullets possibly?
The officials have been playing a funny game with the evacuation orders. It's almost like they *want* some people to be killed.
I think there's a little relevance. He's shown himself as tricky person who performs seemingly beneficial actions with ulterior motives that become apparent only when it's too late. e.g. offering software a software standard for free then discontinuing support when a rival company becomes dependent on it. (I might be paraphrasing badly, but that's the general gist.)
>If there is in fact evidence of this, I'd ask that you present it.\n\nThis seems to be a somewhat balanced paper:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037578/\n\n>In five of seven studies, no attention or concentration impairments were found in subjects who had remained abstinent from 28 days to one year (Lyons et al., 2004; Pope et al., 2001; 2002; 2003; Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2005). Conversely, of the two remaining studies, Solowij (1995) examined cannabis users abstinent from 6 weeks to 2 years and found significant impairment in selective attention and concentration.\n\nBasically, evidence exists for both possibilities, but there's no consensus at the moment.
Ok, I'll do this. Guess I'll cross post to /r/conspiracy for good measure.
>The zoo's operator held a memorial service for the snow monkeys' souls at a nearby Buddhist temple.\n\nJapan doing it right.
I think Brap is referring to language capabilities *used to obscure* ulterior and destructive motives. As such, someone with genuine motives would not have to obscure anything and could thus speak simply.
Your cat saved your life because she wanted to own it.
You know you've made a point when the liberal downvotes flow.
I'm having a hard time understanding how the officials didn't see the need to maintain the evacuation through the weekend.\n\nThe second storm had already been predicted, and it was going to dump on a dam already damaged and almost breached by the first one.

I'm predicting it's going to be an array of diseases that will hit us in overlapping waves. None of them entirely lethal on their own, but together they'll create something like a 99% mortality rate.\n\nEven with a 1% survival though, that's still 70 million humans left.\n\nAnd that's when the asteroid hits.
You should be right at home in LA then. ;)\n\nSeriously though, there might be a little projection going on. i.e. you can see right through people so you assume that everyone can see right through you.\n\nI'd try to give you some platitudes, but you've probably heard them all already. OK, one platitude:\n\nThe universe really does love you. Nobody's perfect, and it's only hope is that you can become better, little by little, day by day. There's no shame in failure, and there's only respect when you try.
Oh I understand now. Actually, that was more my brain not working than any issue with your first explanation. :)\n\nThe phrasing for the definition might be better if it read\n\n>claiming something is true because an "expert", even if qualified in the matter, says it is.\n
Haha. I've been using them in LA when it's cooler, and they're great.\n\nThese are great when it's warmer out.\n\nhttps://www.rei.com/product/856654/rei-co-op-merino-ultralight-hiker-crew-socks\n\n(Giving away all my sock secrets....)
Hahaha. Go for it. (Yes, I talk too much.)
It's not decisive, but it is suspicious. Need to correlate it with the other information regarding the organization.
Check your employment contract. It doesn't stipulate regular compensation.\n\nOh, if you walk. You'll be leaving your boss in the lurch. People may take harsh views about that.
I think that "skepticism" itself can become a kind of religion or "reality tunnel" (as I've heard someone here call it). In other words, there are certain things a skeptic should and shouldn't believe, and if anything falls outside of the prescribed thought set, then it is discarded either out of hand or through efforts of rationalization - the end goal being to remain a "skeptic".\n\nSo while this type of skeptic may be employing critical thinking skills, those skills are being directed towards maintaining their worldview *instead of* their knowledge and understanding.
...and in every crash I've been in, I *have* been wearing a seat belt. Wait a minute. Seat belts cause car crashes!
You know, I wonder if most of the people on here extolling Bill Gates' virtues are younger folk who weren't around to see all of his shenanigans during during the 80's and 90's.
Guys, I think we found Bill Gates' alt account.\n\nHow's it going, Mr. Gates?
Well, I guess that's a little further along in the revolution than I'm willing to go. ;)\n\nI do agree in your overall principle, but there are tangible impacts, not immediately to the corporations perhaps, but to those under their employ and the consumers as well. For example, if a large corporate store finds that their batteries periodically go missing, they will be moved to a secure location, possibly under lock and key. This results in increased hassle and loss of time for both store clerks and consumers. Also, shrinkage is calculated into a store's operating costs which can result in lower wages and an increased price for the product.\n\nOf course one pack of batteries isn't going to affect the greater scheme all that much, but one shouldn't assume that one's actions are unique or isolated when trying to determine the ethics of a behavior.
The MiB seems obsessed with finding a way for the park to kill him. I think he's going to discover that way in the last episode of the season.
Seeing the look on the MiB-s face in the previews, I'm guessing he's gonna get a stabbin. He *has* mentioned, several times, that Arnold's game 'cuts deep.'
If this is so, then Maeve is going to make it out of the park. She seems the most... contaminated, or to put it another way: the most human.
 It seems to be a common occurrence. When you're chasing the LL, you just see the value in what they have that you want: sex. When they come around, that value is lowered (less cost to acquire it) and you can now concentrate on other things: like how much pain that person has caused you over the years by withholding.\n\nHow to get past this? I think you need to direct your attention to how *you* think her perceives you. It seems like you think he only wants you as a sex-toy, that he doesn't appreciate you for you.
[SFW Article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201106/sexual-teasing-who-does-it-and-why)\n\nEdit:\n\n> Teasers ascribed generally benign motives to their teasing. They called it harmless fun, flirting with an edge. But they recognized that it was more fun for them than for their target.\n\n...\n\n> The researchers also conducted quick personality inventories on study participants. Personality type had very little to do with teasing. Anyone and everyone is a potential teaser.
Bluntly, even if ever-so-gently bluntly, telling a woman she's fat and unattractive is a quick ticket to getting socially crucified.\n\nI get what you're saying, but IMO there's different rules for guys and gals in this area.\n\nTo the OP, I don't have any good advice to give, just, uh... less-bad advice: use 'we' language. \n\n* We need to lose weight.\n\n* We need to be more active.\n\n* We need to adopt a healthier meal-plan.\n\nThen, once you've socialized that, make a move, on your part, to do so.\n\nYou can't make someone walk the path, but you can show them the path, and that it's possible to walk it.
Folks are theorizing that Abernathy was one of the cowboys  that Juliet dallied with. Seeing her in person is what enabled later-abernathy to recognize her picture.
What murders? The board members came to the park and then, a few days later, they went back home.
My wife would freak out and go into full meltdown I'm a victim mode.\n\nShe would say I wrote hurtful things and that I don't love her and that she wants a divorce.\n\nOver the next few days she would calm down and rethink her stance. She'd start to absorb what I wrote and think about it. Most likely she would make a few overtures after an appropriate period of time had passed. (So it wouldn't appear as if she was pressured into doing anything.)\n\nSooner or later, she would tell her twin about what I wrote. Her twin would read my posts and give her feedback.\n\nEven though she would be sworn to secrecy by my wife, my SIL would tell her husband.\n\nHer husband, who uses drama as social currency, would tell everyone.\n\nThis would eventually get back to my wife. She would then go into a shame-spiral.\n\nIn an attempt to combat all of the social damage she had incurred, she would initiate divorce.\n\nThrough all of this, I would abide.
>  but I worry that he will just kill himself if I leave him. \n\nOr he'll feel free to fix himself.\n\n
IIRC, in Ep 1, Ford says to Bernard, "I hope you will forgive me the occasional mistake." Looking back, I think that was Ford admitting that Arnold was right, all those years ago.
I think the joke goes, \n\n"In the interviews you've been able to correctly guess how many bowling balls it takes to fill up Lambeau field as well as implement Euler’s Totient function in record time. Hell, when we ran the code from your whiteboarding session it opened up a portal to another dimension! So congratulations, you've got the job! \n\nFirst thing Monday, we're going to put you straight to work writing  REST APIs for our marketing department."
I'd love for Season Two to just do a 180 in theme and convert itself to a Delos version of *Melrose Place*.
1: If you see him at Wolftrap, he alternates which side he comes out on. Last year it was the right side, this year it was the left. My daughter and I got to see him go by on his way to the stage. The most fun was alerting the other patrons who were on their way to their seats: "Hey, you may want to hang out here for a minute or two. Someone's about to come through here on his way to the stage."\n\n2: The man puts on a *show*. Costume changes nearly every song. the acoustic medley was a thing of beauty. Eat It sung to "Layla." I also loved that during his rendition of "Fat" when he jumped up and down, first three rows of the audience jumped up and down with him- as if in response to the "shockwave" of his jump.\n\nLast year I took my daughter and my niece. This year I took my family and my SIL (niece's mother) was *pissed* that I didn't give them the heads-up. (Apparently my niece raved about he show (I didn't know!))\n\nEdit: also, for The Saga Continues, Al will invite the local 502nd to get onstage with him. Which is pretty f'n cool.
He can't commit until the Mayor/Governor gets the final polling results and tells the DA what to charge them with.
Why do real journalism if it doesn't generate revenue, but pandering to the lowest common denominator does?
So.... could we make a deadbedrooms connection and you ^knit ^me ^a ^jane ^cobb ^cap?
It could also be that she knows you're out and is doing social maneuvering to set herself up as the aggrieved party in the divorce.
From your other post:\n\n> I got the job because I can read his code, but I'm a humble newb and won't argue too much when they tell me to do it differently.\n\nSo it sounds like you're the only person working on this person's code. If so, this can be a good thing. You own the code now, the "Just make it work" mandate usually means, "Don't break what already works and don't screw up my deadlines and make me look bad to *my* boss."\n\nRefactor what you can when you can, when it *doesn't* impact your deadlines. Managers generally don't mind your making improvements when it doesn't affect them.
It's only happened a handful of times. I just know that if she does get liquored up and is interested, that I have aggression in my future.
If I can exit the area I will. If I can't get away, I hunt down bottles of water or soda.\n\nMy wife only acts frisky if she's three sheets to the wind. Without fail she will become angry and try to start a fight before we can be alone, so I know that her promises of "I'll be sooooo good to you" mean absolutely nothing. \n\nShorty after the fight-phase she will pass out. I try to get her to drink as much fluids as I can get her to before she does this. \n\nTrying to wean her off of the booze *before* fight-phase initiates fight-phase, and also triggers hostility in all of her friends when they see me trying to "control" her. So I usually don't try to interdict her anymore. I just GTFO if I can; failing that, I ride out the storm and do damage-control so I don't have to deal with the hair-holding and the puking.
Bernard had rejected his cornerstone and then completely rejected Ford by trying to kill him. For Ford, it was time to move on.
I was thinking of getting one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YMPHQUG/ref=s9_acsd_simh_hd_bw_bFex3_c_x_2_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_r=CJ2JCX1V76MCD6DVRKJK&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=a81ce419-28bb-53e5-af3f-ba97d0fe1e6b&pf_rd_i=3732341) but it wouldn't arrive in time.
Wow, good luck lady. \n\nIt's one thing to steal from a charity, but I guarantee you just pissed off a fuck-ton of Marines.
> MiB specifically says Teddy is there to lose.\n\nIt's things like this that make me think that the MiB may be Logan.\n\nIf Logan dies and Dolores is responsible, I don't think William would  keep her in that loop. Even if she rebooted, he'd still be inclined to see her as semi-human.\n\nSuch a dickish thing is right up Logan's alley. What does he care? She's just a robot.\n\nLogan saw William as a bit of a chump. The MiB sees Teddy in the same light. They're not winners.\n\nIf he's Logan, the MiB knows that Hector is patterned off of him. He's disdainful of Hector, as Hector doesn't have the uniqueness that Logan thinks someone made in Logan's image should have.\n\nMeh, I don't know. That's what I like about this show, it keeps you guessing. We'll find out in a week.
I think the switch was more of an expression of power and control. He knew that no one in the park could hurt him. \n\nWhy would he care how fast he drew his gun? He did it to inspire terror in the hosts. 
Don't reply. Some people feed on the energy of conflict and pain. Some when they feel helpless, find solace in hurting those they perceive as weaker than themselves.\n\nJust stay silent. Let her shout into the void. Give her nothing.
*"I'm going to do things. Wonderful things. You wait and see, you'll see that I'm doing wonderful things. Others may say that I'm not doing these things, but they're wrong. I've set my mind to do these things. These things will happen. Those people, they're sad, wrong people who know that they're wrong. You just wait and see."*
> While it will NEVER happened BLM should (peacefully) protest against this attack\n\nPrediction: While it most likely won't make the national news, a few black churches in the Chicago area will probably hold vigils calling for an end to racial violence.\n\nWhy? Because good people are good. Their signal just gets lost in the noise.
Not that I'm aware of, I doubt that would even be announced public if it were true. \n\n
One of the facets of this season that I particularly liked was that while the writers planted many hints that the MiB was William, they usually did so in such a way to allow the nay-sayers to have their own  reasonins.
It's whatever lies outside of the boundaries that the couple puts in place. \n\nMonogamy is usually part of a couple's social mores so it is applied.
What I'm enjoying is all of the wiggle room left for each side to make their case. The fun isn't in being right, the fun is found in trying to figure out if you're right or not.
They may not have said anything, but everyone would have had their cell-phones out and set to record.
So say we all.
Teddy seems more like [this type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4UIKbcSHCc).
Good on you for doing that.
I think he goes out of his way to make sure they're viewed as pets/robots by *humans*.
> Why the hell would you want to stay with me if I'm as bad as you say I am? That makes no sense.\n\nHe wants the marriage to survive until the kids are grown up. So when you confront him and put your finger on the destruct button, he has to deflect or even give ground, so that the marriage will survive until the kids are grown up.
I think it's cool that William's hat is getting dirtier as the series goes on.
> When you don't have much, being a "man" is the only thing you can have left.\n\nThey're honor and reputation cultures, but with much less to do with honor these days.
What'd you do to get that treatment? Did you hit a double or wreck the pitcher's no-hitter?
If you want to know someone's true character, give them power.\n\nThere's the possibility that your SIL isn't terribly attracted to you, she just likes the thrill of messing with you and she knows that messing with you is safe. In essence, she's sexually harassing you.\n\nWhat do? Make sure there's an unpleasant consequence whenever she makes a play. I suggest employing "Who, What, Why."\n\nThe next time she does something that is *obviously* inappropriate, ask her with a FIRM tone and LOUD voice :\n\n* WHO SAID YOU COULD <state action here>?\n\n* WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT <state action here> IS ACCEPTABLE?\n\n* WHY DID YOU <state action here>?\n\nThe goal here is to have her associate a negative emotion with her actions and that response should be *shame*. She knows what she's doing is wrong, but hasn't been taken to task yet. Because she's been getting away with it, she's assuming there is consent. There isn't, so make that CRYSTAL CLEAR to her and everyone else within earshot.\n\nYou're going to get shit for this. You're wife and SIL think you're a doormat on this issue. They're not going to like it when the script changes. Hold your ground. No one is allowed to sexually harass you.
I think Ford was going out of his way to make sure no one noticed.
Take what you think I was describing and dial it down by about 3/4ths. :)
Older ladies in the front row: \\**sploosh*\\*
> Thanks for the advice, you're right. She'll say things like "you're so impatient with me lately", or "I just seem to annoy you these days" and things like that make me want to just yell back "what do you expect?!"\n\nShe's attempting to control your behavior by playing the victim. Don't take the bait and attempt to assuage her fears or affirm what she said, just give non-committal responses: "Huh, whaddya know," "That's interesting," "Hrmm...."\n
Compared Bernard's loop, she handled it like a boss.
Low end safes usually still have a minimal fire and/or water protection.\n\nI have my safe bolted to the floor and between two heavy-as-shit bookshelves. It's main purpose isn't so much to keep the raiders from the wasteland out as much as to keep my young son from smoking himself or others.
The MiB does keep calling Teddy a loser.
No nonononnonoNO! Stop writing your number on that dollar bill. Oh, I'm sorry. I stand corrected, you're writing it on a twenty to show her that you're a man of means.\n\nI'm... I'm going to be over here... by the door.... to escape the shame.
> I am convinced that getting a job has a lot to do with personality.\n\nAyup, to quote one coworker talking to another: *"G, when the situation calls for it, it's OK to be an asshole... but you're being an asshole all of the time."*
I'm starting to view Logan as a dumb little puppy playing with the big dogs. He thinks he's barking, but he's just yapping.
>  But Westworld has almost certainly helped him hone his dickbagishness and had some effect on how he treats other human beings, including his future brother-in-law.\n\nCertainly, he's now a more kind, gentle soul: he takes in strays.
No clue. \n\nHonestly this whole thread is pretty fucking insane. 
> Its a form of psychological power play that keeps the recipient in a hope state...and that was how I survived / let a DB last 12 years...hope.\n\nYup, in those instances, she's not trading sex for services, she's trading *the hope* of having sex for services. Actual sex isn't on the bargaining table. \n\nEver heard the phrase, "Well, if you play your cards right tonight, then maybe...blahblahblah." You're not being offered sex, just the off-chance that you may have sex. 
remorse? They all look stoned.
What color was her vest?
I had to cut-off my wife also. It took a few years for her to accept it. During that period I was teh Debil.\n\nEdit: She has her own salary and I pay almost all of the utilities, so I'm not trying to control her. I grew tired of screwing up my finances trying to keep up with her spending.
That could be it. Logan never believed William when he claimed that Dolores was sentient.\n\nThen, years later, he sees a dying woman come to life at the death of her imagined daughter. Feeling dead inside, Logan now seeks the center of the Maze in the hopes that he will find the sweet release of death at the hands of a host, the same way that William died.
> There would be a house to sell and kids to juggle around. Not easy.\n\n
I have a rule: if I'm arguing with myself about whether or not to hit on my wife for more than five minutes I'm to just go ahead and initiate.\n\nIt's on you to initiate if you want sex. It's up to her to either reject or accept your advances.\n\nIf she rejects you, you owe her nothing.\n\nIf you go into a cuddling session trying to stay chaste, but *knowing* that you want to jump her, then you're being duplicitous. \n\nIf you go into cuddling meaning to be chaste, but change your mind, then own it. Don't feel ashamed. There is nothing wrong with you for doing this. 
Sure that's not Galactus?
Valentine's Day holds no power over me.\n\nThere is no spoon.
She'd freeze like a deer in headlights and then pretend that she didn't hear me. A few minutes later, once she had processed what I had said and then rode the shame-roller-coaster, she'd attempt to verbally castigate me for making her feel awkward. I'd stop myself from rolling my eyes and then attempt to disengage.\n\n\nMy wife has always had a problem with low level things like flirting. Hell, if when I want to make sure sex **won't** happen that night, I'll flirt with her during the day. So overtly hitting her up for sex would trigger the poor lass' defenses in a big way.\n\nShe's almost completely driven by responsive desire, so if I want anything to happen, I have to initiate and do so non-verbally. Going about it any other way seems to send her into some  stubborn "you can't control me" loop.\n\nEdit: This is omitting whatever fucked up behavior that I'm glossing over that contributes to our DB.\n
His wife was dead and his daughter viewed him as a monster. He wanted to die and for that death to have some meaning. 
Was the guy in the center the commodore from Pirates of the Caribbean?
Well Maeve shares Ford's utter disdain for humanity, so odds are they'll sit down, have a drink, and share a toast to the woman with the white shoes.
I'm on Team Clem. She has clothes now. Things could happen.
I've always been a fan of *Ghost Facers*.\n\n
I think there was an episode of Squibillies that dealt with something like that.
Translation: she wants to go to Big Bear.\n\nLoaded question: who normally pays for these trips? All you? All her? 50/50?

I think OP's wife knows what Kara is doing, but Kara has framed it as harmless teasing. OP's wife isn't taking him very seriously.
She's just being competitive. Once she has you back and "beats" your GF for your affections, your relationship with your wife will begin to decline again.\n\nSome people just need to feel like they're winning. Based on the (very) little information you've given, you're wife seems like one of these people.

> I wonder how much stigma are we, people who have experienced DB, dragging around.\n\nThey weren't mad at you for making the points you did, they were mad at you for being *WRONG*. You weren't *WRONG* because you were using faulty logic or bad examples, you were *WRONG* because the purpose of that visit was to console her and provide emotional support.\n\nYou have to learn to read the situation and mouth the appropriate sounds at the appropriate times. If you can't, then just bite your lip. No one likes a metaphorical punch to the gut when they're already feeling down.\n\n\nEDIT: A suggestion going forward-> try not to get so worked up about it. In talking with people over the years, I've found that DB's are a hell of a lot more common than anyone will openly admit.
You explain to her that it's a bit creepy for someone that old to be dating an 18 year-old.\n\nThen you also explain that to your daughter.
Because he knows that sooner or later humanity will find out and do what humanity has traditionally done to evolutionary competitors: wipe them out.
With the showrunners' attention to detail in every other facet of production, I can't think of any other explanation.\n\n
I think it was to visually convey to the audience that William was capable of horrific violence.
I love that Jimmi Simpson guessed that he was the MiB when his make-up guy wanted to change his eyebrows. He watched the other actors on the set and found that his eyebrows were being altered to resemble those of 'Mr. Harris.'
So anyone thrown Dolores Wyatt Abernathy into an anagram machine or anything?

Afghanistan is land-locked. The easiest way into the country (and the only way for our Navy's jets) is through Pakistan.
Thanks for posting this. It's nice to see other people bring a glimmer of humanity to a social media rage-wave.\n\nOver the years, after seeing the fallout or multiple instances of the internet pointing their fingers, ringing their bells and shouting "SHAME" I'm inclined to wait before I judge. \n\nThis was a private moment between these two people. Now they will both have to deal with the repercussions of this video being posted. If the girl is this worked up about missing her appointment, how will she feel about all of the judgement she's now receiving?
Considering that the hosts don't remember things they way humans do: the hosts *relive* their memories, it could jive that her "remembering" to lie would lead her to literally hear what Arnold was originally telling her to do all of those years ago.
Won't take no for an answer, eh?\n\n\nNext time, say no. When she won't let you alone and then, when she's doing her thing, start singing this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n"I'm Henry VIII, I Am"\n\n(originally by Harry Champion)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm Henry the eighth, I am\n\nHenry the eighth, I am, I am\n\nI got married to the widow next door\n\nShe's been married seven times before\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd every one was an Henry (Henry)\n\nShe wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (No Sam)\n\nI'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry\n\nHenry the eighth I am\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSecond verse, same as the first\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm Henry the eighth, I am\n\nHenry the eighth, I am, I am\n\nI got married to the widow next door\n\nShe's been married seven times before\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd every one was an Henry (Henry)\n\nShe wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (No Sam)\n\nI'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry\n\nHenry the eighth I am\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm Henry the eighth, I am\n\nHenry the eighth, I am, I am\n\nI got married to the widow next door\n\nShe's been married seven times before\n\nAnd every one was an Henry (Henry)\n\nShe wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (No Sam)\n\nI'm her eighth old man, I'm Henry\n\nHenry the eighth I am\n\n&nbsp;\n\nH-E-N-R-Y\n\nHenry (Henry)\n\nHenry (Henry)\n\nHenry the eighth I am, I am\n\nHenry the eighth I am\n\nYeah!
Try to dial it down a bit more. Wiggle your ass and say "Oooh lah lah" or something. Going from 0-100 can scare people off.

Oft quoted factoid: the actor who played Klink was jewish and would only take the role if Klink never won. Not even the smallest victory. Ever.

I think Ford just wants the sentient hosts to find their way to his house so they can sit down and have a cuppa.
He knew what he was doing. When he asked that question, just about every viewer silently thought "Racism."\n\nHe just isn't allowed to say that because his producers are too scared to let him state the obvious. You never know who may pull their advertising.\n\n
I don't know why. All it should take is watching the video of Cenk Cygur trying to debate Sam Harris to realize how full of shit they are.

The pebble thing isn't the entirety of it, the following quotes are straight out of her book\n\n>As she grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a “motorcycle chick.” Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just “relax on me.” **Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying.**\n\n------\n\n>I shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. **Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.**\n\n\nWho is the sexual predator here? 
A fair amount of the spills are water. As in, straight from a river/lake/resivour water with no additives. A majority of the time spills are on containment. \n\n>The study is showing that there is a big damn problem with how fracking companies are handling their materials.\n\nSpills are going to happen no matter what you do. A pickup pulls on containment and is leaking windshield wiper fluid, it counts as a spill. A freshwater truck driver doesn't close his valve all the way before pulling away, it counts as a spill. Someone overfills a generator, it counts as a spill. These aren't all acid trucks throwing gallons of shit on the ground

> many see themselves as full blown embodiments of Apache warriors and they have had some disturbing incidents of mutilation of enemy corpses with fucking hatchets. \n\nWar crimes aside, that's pretty fucking metal man\n\n\n

>Pruitt has sued the EPA repeatedly while he was the attorney general in Oklahoma—**a state suffering multiple earthquakes as a result of fracking**, and where he took no action.\n\n\nWhy start an article out like this...\n\n>These tremors are not naturally occurring. They are caused by wastewater injection, a process in which million of gallons of salty water are pumped deep underground. This water is often a by-product of fracking, the natural-gas mining process that has spread across the country and revolutionized the U.S. energy industry.\n\nFrom the source forbes used. 
That's cool and all, but you don't get to go around labeling everyone that disagrees a nazi and assault them. \n\n
> All fash gets bashed equally regardless of their identity. \n\nIf this new antifa movement would have stuck to targeting legitimate fascists like neo-nazis, then I would just be indifferent. But the mentality that they can just label anyone they don't like a fascist is cancerous and completely wrong
The differences between Sadam ruled Iraq and Mexico are enormous so this comparison doesn't really work. 
Ehh... Looks legit to me. Nalgene on the assault pack is dirty, he has his camelback in the pack, rifle and pouches have mags, kevlar has the rhino mount attached, and he's wearing a frog top. \n\nDesert warfare training is at 29 palms and I never saw any mud huts or walls at the MOUT towns, it was all conex or stone. \n\nIMO looks like a doghandler in country. \n\nOnly thing that puzzles me is he doesn't appear to be wearing a plate carrier

> However, I do think that modern generals want to be as aggressive as possible\n\nTo a certain degree that's their job. Civilian control of the military is the counterweight. 
> If self-professed fiscal conservatives gave a flying fuck about government waste the military budget would be the first thing they'd hack at because the amount of pure waste is staggering and **could be done away with in the tens of billions of dollars without affecting the military's ability to project force.**\n\nReally now? Please, do explain. What capabilities are required to project force? How much from the budget can we cut and still meet  operational readiness requirements? \n\n>Our military budget is more than the next 5 countries combined.\n\nThat may sound damning, but it really is meaningless. None of those countries are tasked with or capable of anything even remotely close to what our military is. \n\n>Congress allocates money to build tanks and weapons systems the military itself says they don't want or need\n\nYeah, the acquisition process is terribly inefficient and needs to be reformed. \n\n>billions of dollars from the discretionary budget have a tendency to just vanish.\n\nWhere do you believe those billions of dollars went?\n\n>If self-professed fiscal conservatives gave a flying fuck about government waste the military budget would be the first thing they'd hack at\n\nIs it possible to give a fuck about more than one thing, perhaps even at the same time? \n\n>Instead you spend time trying to stop tiny trickles like "social benefits for undocumented immigrants"\n\n>At best it's hypocrisy and stupidity about "fiscal conservativism" (a term that has always meant fuck all), at worst it's motivated by malice\n\n\nAs I said in another post-\n\nThe crux of the issue is that "undocumented immigrants" aren't even entitled to social benefits. If it's racist to not prioritize undocumented immigrants, then it should be just as racist to not prioritize everyone that lives in poverty south of the US border. Does an impoverished persons location somehow strip the racist aspect?\n\nBut anyway, this was your original post\n\n>When you put cutting the bloated military budget in half ahead of cutting benefits for undocumented immigrants I'll believe you're motivated by "fiscal conservativism" and not racism.\n\nWhat if I just wanted it cut by 1/4, would I still be racist? What about 1/3?  How should I rank other categories of government spending in order to not be a racist?

>The United States Department of State (DOS),[3] often referred to as the State Department, **is the United States federal executive department that advises the President and leads the country in foreign policy issues.**[4] Equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries, the State Department is responsible for the international relations of the United States, negotiates treaties and agreements with foreign entities, and represents the United States at the United Nations. The Department was created in 1789 and was the first executive department established.[5]\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State\n\n\n>The Department's mission is to shape and sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just, and democratic world and foster conditions for stability and progress for the benefit of the American people and people everywhere.

It's not that simple, the logistics/command and control issues of combining 27 different militaries are practically insurmountable. Imagine trying to call in CAS in 5 different languages without dropping ordinance on your own head.

Antifa assaulting random people wearing red hats is still wrong even if neo-Nazis are advocating for genocide. \n\nLena Dunham deserves a punch just as much as milo, but I'd denounce anyone that hit her because doing so is wrong. \n\nJustifying political violence because a groups ideology supports it is counterintuitive. Would I be doing the correct thing if I were to assault antifas due to their desire to establish a communist government? Anarcho-Communism is not compatable with US ideals

How far does this logic extend? If we only built 198 we could pay for x number of cancer treatments. If only built 197 we could pay for x number of college degrees. Where do you draw the line? The current mantra is that demanding NATO countries increase defense spending is idiotic because we benefit greatly from their dependence on how much we spend. Which is it?\n\nThe crux of the issue is that "undocumented immigrants" aren't even entitled to social benefits. If it's racist to not prioritize undocumented immigrants, then it should be just as racist to not prioritize everyone that lives in poverty south of the US border.

Idk man, being a boot in the infantry sucked donkey cock back when the wars were in full swing. Especially if your seniors had seen some shit.

As she grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a “motorcycle chick.” Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just “relax on me.” **Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying.**\n\n-------\n\nI shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. **Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.**\n\nThose two quotes are word for word out of her book\n\n>The story is she looked at her sisters vag... read it, it wasn't sexual in nature at all, it certainly wasn't an adult getting off on a young kid\n\nNah, wooing a child like a sexual predator and masturbating in bed next to her "sticky, muscly little body" isn't sexual in nature at all!
The general public more than likely cannot name their states Senators or even a single sitting justice on the Supreme Court. \n\nWhich of Obama's picks did you know of beforehand?

He's a professional troll. You have to give him at least a little credit, he uses identity politics while railing against identity politics and has found a way to make money doing so. 
How did you come to the conclusion that I'm a pedophile?

If we want to say that peace is too expensive, update the NATO alliance, and watch Russia gobble up former Eastern Bloc nations, this will eventually and inevitably lead to war.\n\nIt's ironic that the same people bitching about the US acting like word police want to shift the responsibility of keeping Europe safe to the US. \n\nPeace is never too expensive, but that doesn't preclude us from expecting Europe to "pay its fair share".

>And this leads to a really weird and incestuous mindset where "the way we've always done things" is rarely challenged with newer techniques or industry standards.\n\nConsidering how entrenched the field is in its mindset, where do you believe the best candidate for DIA director should come from?

Why are you in a vain attempt trying to insult me by calling me racist?\n\nBlacks are not oppressed in America today! Look at sports where in the NFL and NBA 70% of athletes are black and richer than most white people will ever be. None of them claim systemic oppression except for the half-black Colin Kaepernick. The fucking president is half-black but he must be oppressing blacks because he's half-white, right?\n\nLook at Lil' Wayne's video about black lives matter when he is being interviewed, even he says he doesn't know what they're talking about.\n\nhttp://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/325 80-90% of Natives died from disease, not because "all white people are racist and want to kill everyone who isn't white"
Are theories true until disproven?
I'm sure the current administration will defend a sexual assault victim.
Atheism doesn't make sense, you cannot prove there is no God. Agnosticism is a much better ideology if you think you don't believe.

Pay to play politics per usual, Donnie is really breaking the mold.
12% of local police officers are black which is pretty damn close to the % of blacks in America. 9% of all lawmakers are black, again, pretty close to 13%. 12% of federal judges are black which is very close to 13%.\n\nI don't know where you are getting your statistics.
You know, she said she wants to advance the kingdom of God through the US education system. And it's like everyone totally forgot that the US was in part created to get away from a government that shoved religion down peoples throats.\n\nIt looks like Trump WANTS a civil war.
I've seen platinum players playing support and pushing the lane since the first wave. Being platinum is not an indicator of skill, it's based on how much you play and how lucky you are with matchmaking or who you play with.\n\nSolo queuing to raise your MMR was a lot easier on legacy for whatever reason, I guess it's because the playerbase wasn't as big and now there is a huge fluctuation of new players who have never played a moba before.
If media wasn't so overpriced and unavailable over the internet then the Pirate Bay wouldn't be needed.

I think it would be interesting to have an ethereal support hero that can only be hit by spells, not autoattacks.
The jail and prison industries plus DO/CO unions also profit from drugs being illegal. And the whole DEA would cease to exist if drugs were legal. There are the criminals who want drugs to remain illegal as well.

Blame others for your problems, it will really help you become successful\n\nAnd you actually ignored my point about how successful minorities don't complain about oppression, because you know you are wrong.
To the people who think it will be abused; I've played over 1,000 hours in Dota 2 and I was only flamed over the mic once by some Russian girl. But, with this game being on PS4 it might attract a younger audience than Dota 2. I think that is what's taking longer for VOIP. The cross platform functionality. Anyway, I would like to see VOIP implemented as well.

Isn't Pakistan cooperating with the USA's war on terror by propagating it so the US has something to fight?
Right, just like some males and females identify as the opposite gender even though scientifically they are not what they say they are.\n\nNative Americans dealt with a hell of a lot more than slavery and they don't complain about white people oppressing them because they live in reality. Sure they recognize that they were mistreated in the past, but now, they are just like every other citizen. You don't see Native Americans killing each other at alarming rates, or committing 50% of all murders in the country.
Building it yourself is a lot cheaper and it's easier than most people think, just plug everything in where it fits, the only tricky part can be some CPU heatsinks.\n\nFor the graphics card I'd go with AMD and for the CPU Intel, then you just have to find a motherboard that supports those two, or you can get prebuilt if you really want to.
I doubt it's about religion, these political hacks couldn't care less about religion, they just cherry pick what they like. More likely it's going to be an attempt to create more republicans.
Dota matches sometimes only last 20 minutes if it's a stomp, but most matches are the same length as in Paragon. And there are always things that come up unexpectedly when you're playing.\n\nI will say again that it's important for competitive play.
Of course she thinks it's all about her. Typical narcissist. This is about the future of the USA.
So they are complaining that what they did to Obama is now happening to them?
They are right, they both support prohibition to target minorities and poor people, they have enough nukes to destroy the world several times, the government is run by a few rich people to only benefit themselves, and they are the two countries with the highest prison populations. Truly great common interests.
Freezing the lane also saves you from ganks. If you are constantly pushing you will overextend putting yourself in hostile territory (the other side of the river).\n\nKeeping the lane in one place by only last hitting and counter pushing is important because you can then zone the offlaner denying them exp.\n\nToo many times I see players who have no idea what they are doing in-game. I don't have enough time to raise my MMR, so when I do play I'm stuck with people who don't know the basics, and they probably don't want to learn.

I guess that's why there are there legal versions of all the popular illegal drugs in prescription pill form. They know it's all medicine. Even though they define schedule 1 drugs as not having any medical value there are synthetic versions of heroin and cannabis legally available.
I guess you just read the headline and based your comment on emotion. One of the "white" occupiers was killed, and they were on public land. The natives are trespassing on private property and they haven't had their day in court yet, so they could be acquitted.
All of my friends who play Paragon have noticed this as well; ever since the Monolith update something strange is going on and matchmaking is just terrible.

Last hits, map awareness, analyzing situations to maximize efficiency (i dont know if you really want to memorize all the numbers, but thats the best way to achieve the aforementioned), if you like to jungle you have to kite the minions so they do less damage to you (they attack fast standing still), if you play mid always look for the river buffs to get mana and the actual buff (red buff is good in mid because it's usually a caster playing mid in this meta), use wards, and cooperate with your team 
Isn't being in the US illegally technically a crime?
All of this gang related killing would be reduced immensely if prohibition was ended. But politicians care more about making money off of other peoples suffering.
If they truly believed in the bible then we would be able to grow and consume any plant according to Genesis 1:29 and the 1st amendment of the constitution.\n\nBut they care more about the pharmaceutical industry, alcohol, tobacco, prisons, jails, gangs, cartels, wasteful jobs at the DEA where they only go after "potheads", and that lobbyist money.

I think if a person wants their kid/s to learn about religion then it is up to the parent to teach them or send them to religious education classes. Do you really think Betsy Devos will be supporting Islam, Atheism, Buddhism, or Hinduism to be taught in schools? No. It will only be about Christianity. And of course they'll cherry pick which parts of Christianity they want to be taught.

I wonder how much money would be saved and gained by ending the war on drugs. But I guess politicians just love gangs and cartels too much to cripple them.

Uhmm.... the article doesn't even say which policy the advisor disagreed with

Legal plunder I guess
You are getting angry because you know you're wrong!\n\nMinorities are successful in America today but you're being bogged down because of "white oppression"? YOU are just looking for excuses for your own failings.
There are exceptions to every rule. And of course you don't want to employ this tactic for the entirety of the match.
This is nonsensical propaganda. Marijuana edibles are extremely expensive, nobody is going to give them away.

Yes for all players it's paused. Each player has a limited amount of pauses and the other team can unpause after a short amount of time, but if someone is afk, people usually wait. This feature is very important for competitive play.

Thank goodness.  I was wondering why someone had a litter of puppies in their ductwork.
I'd be careful mistaking the Vatican for a primarily religious rather than a primarily geopolitical interest.  Remember that it only stopped presenting as the militarily aggressive, expansionistic, conquest-oriented Roman Empire due to the predominance of all the legit Christians in the Middle East in Jesus' wake, and even then it kept the classic Roman Empire's sign of warning to would-be dissidents: the cross.  After persecuting, jailing and executing most of the original apostles, it did a name change for PR reasons and claimed apostolic succession directly from the apostles nearly a century after the last one died.\n\nThe group for which the Vatican fronts - the same thing corrupting the Pharisees in Jesus' time - also responded by concocting Islam completely.  Because you can't very well present as a Christian church *and* pave over the legit Middle Eastern Christians yourself without another major PR problem.  Hence, [Catholicism and Islam share the very same ancient Babylonian occult symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA) once you pry away the superficially distinct veneers.  A respectable-looking exoteric presentation for the goyim outside, and a useful bunch of esoteric covert organizing symbolism for the initiated working the global subversion on the inside.

'Should' it?  First we have to determine whether or not it 'can'.\n\nNo authority for that was ever to my knowledge ceded to the federal or state governments, making 'should' irrelevant here.

Hilarious, Clive.  This is why we require actual courts of law.\n\nHe also makes an excellent case for the healthy version of fundamentalism.\n\n*[Edit: Downvoted But Not Refuted]*
The natural response would seem to be to work to restore our common law courts of, by, and for the People nationwide.\n\n[National Liberty Alliance](http://NationalLibertyAlliance.org/) is already organizing exactly this effort and [will train, online, for free](http://nationallibertyalliance.org/civicscourse).  They with also need four full-time jury administrators in each county.  These will be full-time, paid positions for which the NLA claims to have already secured the funding.\n\nThe People are already getting educated and organized to restore Our system of rights and laws.  As they gain support in their counties the effort is to approach their county Sheriff, to show him the law as established including the full scope of his authority, duties, and liability for failure to perform those duties.  Today's Sheriffs have usually been severely misinformed on these points.  They then offer support if the Sheriff opts to uphold his oath of office and re-emplace the common law juries back into the courthouses.  If he opts not to they can simply replace him with someone who will do so, and track the offending former Sheriff for later adjudication.
Lawyers used to call it 'criminal conspiracy', 'racketeering', or subversion.\n\nBefore the BAR Association committed regulatory capture, obreption and subreption against the entire judicial system.
Yes, we already do that.  But not quite that way.\n\nWe did that when We, the People ordained and established a limited government with specific, limited duties and authorities.  Since that time, rogue public servants have expanded that well beyond the functions we assigned to them.  Every single authority, duty, role or budget item the government has expanded itself into without our approval, they've expanded into what are in fact the rights and inherent authority of the People.  This is usurpation, and though the statutorily-predicated courts have been predominantly approving it it remains unlawful under our common law.  They simply haven't been caught at it for the most part, by the courts and predominantly by the People.\n\nLimited government of course means limited taxes to maintain it in the first place, and for worthy causes there's no need for the state to manage something - it would be funded quite well through a private corporation, religious group or charity.\n\nSecondly, the [income tax as it's practiced is unconstitutional](http://famguardian.org/disks/TaxDVD/Articles/THE%20TRUTH%20ABOUT%20THE%20INCOME%20TAX.doc).  When it was first started it was hyped as a 'necessary' war measure - many lawless enterprises start under the pretext of necessity - and the People were told would only last through the war.  After the war, the IRS continued sending out tax forms to see what kind of a response they would get.  Predictably, the People blithely complied and so it continued.  [The IRS is a private agency](http://famguardian.org/subjects/Taxes/Intelligence/IRSOrigins.htm), and [it was commissioned in Puerto Rico](http://www.supremelaw.org/authors/cooper/cooper.htm) [dense reading awaits you at that link] because Puerto Rico is considered a possession of the federal U.S. unlike the States, and the federal government is deemed to be able to implement things there it could never lawfully implement here.  Later, an internal reshuffle brought the IRS onshore.\n\nThirdly, contrary to the urban myth income taxes aren't for revenue collection.  If that sounds outlandish, that's the position of the former chairman for the Federal Reserve.  In a 1964 article by him ['*[Taxes for Revenue Are Obsolete](http://www.constitution.org/tax/us-ic/cmt/ruml_obsolete.htm)*'], he stated:\n\n> What Taxes Are Really For\n>\n>Federal taxes can be made to serve four principal purposes of a social and economic character. These purposes are:\n>\n>1.  As an instrument of fiscal policy to help stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar;\n>\n>2. To express public policy in the distribution of wealth and of income, as in the case of the progressive income and estate taxes;\n>\n>3. To express public policy in subsidizing or in penalizing various industries and economic groups;\n>\n>4. To isolate and assess directly the costs of certain national benefits, such as highways and social security.\n\nAfter all, our rogue public servants merely borrow hypothecated debt currency from the Federal Reserve [promissory notes are IOUs - a promise to actually pay someone in lawful money at a later date in return for the benefit of using the good or service until the true owner comes to collect their property, which is why we 'purchase' things now rather than 'buy' them] to pay for its programs and then taxes the People to pay off the interest on this imaginary faux-money.  Which isn't printed by the U.S. Treasury as is required by the Constitution, is not of the substance required by the Constitution, and is printed instead by a private organization to whom our public servants purport to make us all more beholden as this routine continues and the interest on the 'debt' of imaginary money continues to grow, payable in actual real-world value of course.\n\nAt this point calculations vary, but estimates are that the People are being taxed up to 50%.\n\n> When I was a teen, beginning work in the early fifties, Uncle Sam took less than 3% in income taxes, and 1% out of the first $3,000 in wages, or $30 for Social Security, making less than $100 total a year for the average beginning worker. According to an article in The New Republic of Dec. 2, 1991, in 1948, a married couple with median income and two children, paid only 2% in state, federal, and Social Security taxes. In 1999, Social Security was 15.3%, plus 2.9% for Medicare, out of the first $62,700 in wages, or $11,411.40, and then perhaps 30% in federal taxes…if you were lucky. That is about an even 50%, plus hundreds of hidden taxes on every phone call you make, over 40 cents on every gallon of gas you buy, luxury and excise taxes, and hundreds more at the federal level alone.  [[source](http://www.gold-eagle.com/article/how-many-taxes-do-you-really-pay)]\n\nAt some point, the time will come when the People will have to collectively reassert their sovereignty over their own public servants.  They will need to re-establish the common law juries ordained and established by law and intercede in the affairs of their increasingly rogue public servants, trying them and ruling directly what behavior is or is not unconstitutional.  The alternative is to quietly cede sovereignty over to those public officials and deem them our masters, submitting to whatever whimsies happen to fall out of them at any given time.  I'm in favor of the former option, and believe the exercise of it is long overdue.  If you're interested, [National Liberty Alliance](http://NationalLibertyAlliance.org/) is working with the People to re-establish those common law courts out of which the People were defrauded over a century ago in favor of unlawful statutory courts which lack the authority in law to fine or imprison but nevertheless usurp it anyway.  I encourage those interested in supporting patriotism to consider working with them, and they will train for free online.

If they were the actual voice of the People, they would keep themselves to the limitations We'd ordained and established for them in the Constitution.  They do not.  They also ignore what we did tell them to do: for example, Congress is responsible for standardizing the training and providing the funding of the state militias.  Let's not forget that lawful money is only to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and isn't paper.  And that none of our current courts operate as courts of record under common law - which are the only type of courts We, the People have authorized to fine or imprison.\n\nThere are fewer pernicious forms of subversion than propagating the notion that the office sanctifies the actions of the officeholder.  We must be careful to keep clear of the [color of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_\\(law\\)) fallacy.\n\nWe repeatedly find these would-be public servants enacting legislation which We, the People haven't been asking them to.  Usually for the benefit of corporations.\n\nAdditionally, the constituencies of legislators have become so large that it is no longer feasible for them to represent their constituents faithfully even if they took a mind to.
People seem to be doing it because they don't understand how surnames work - which is why I used this juncture to put it out there for those that don't - and people seem to have strong feelings in favor of the prevalent misconception.  As evidenced by counterclaims.

**SOLVED.**\n\nI had the exact same problem on an HTC One M8.  OP's solution didn't work for me, and after much reverting of Google Play and Play Services and rebooting I somehow managed to delete my Google account on my phone as a side-effect, without going through Settings > Accounts.  Attempts to re-establish my existing Google account on my device were met with various app crashes.  Then I found [this](http://androidforums.com/threads/solution-cannot-add-google-account-after-factory-reset.695054/), which directs rooted readers to comment out *74.125.93.113 android.clients.google.com* in their */etc/hosts/* file to solve the account creation problem.  In my case my hosts file had too many adblocking entries to easily edit, so I renamed it *hosts.bak*, assuming [correctly] that the system would notice there was no *hosts* file the next time it went for it, autogenerate a new instance, and solve the problem.  This worked: Google Play Store was then able to complete the online check successfully and add a new entry for my existing Google account.\n\nTL;DR: */etc/hosts* is sending Google services to check a non-working server.  Rename */etc/hosts* to */etc/hosts.bak*, or comment out the line for *android.clients.google.com* in the file by adding a *#* symbol at the beginning.  This is also likely why users who factory reset their phones weren't finding any relief; the new default *hosts* file had the same entry.
I don't!  Not a bit.  And as we've seen with our Presidencies it's both unreasonable and unfeasible to expect anyone to uphold laws and rights purely on the honor system, whether they're public employees or the People themselves.\n\nThis is why the militia are mustered only to suppress invasions and insurrections.  When those aren't present, domestic law enforcement is provided by the Sheriff and those among the People whom he deputizes.  These are held accountable to the common law - including the idea that if there's no injured party / rights violation there's no crime and no authority to intervene.  It also upholds the right to due process for all, provided by a jury of peers rather than some arbitrary decrees handed down by potentially rogue public servants.  Everybody's rights are upheld and unless they're violating rights or subverting our form of government everyone succeeds.  The distinction being that if they *are*, society has the means to put a stop to it.  The People, acting collectively, emplacing and acknowledging their own chosen personnel acting on legitimate authority, and all collectively upholding rights, laws and principles.  It's a beautiful system.  And when we stopped having common law courts and prevalent, respected militias, all the problems we now encounter were able to take effect.

At the risk of starting a huge debate here, I don't think we have the same understanding of what the Scriptural category of sodomy was/is.  It appears to refer to ['a foreign, idolatrous cult practice'](http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibh2.htm) which is both a blasphemy due to its idolatry, and something our Creator warned us about because it did and does subvert whole nations.  While Leviticus 18:21 appears to condemn homosexual practices wholesale, the verse immediately before it commands us not to give our children over to a particular foreign idol.\n\n[Which gets interesting](http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibh4.htm), because it was the cult of this idol during the Old Testament times which would use downlow sex, particularly downlow gay sex, as its principal recruitment mechanism.  Wild orgies would be held somewhere out of town by night, and to continue to be invited to participate by night meant enacting the agendas of the cult by day.  Oftentimes this would include the vilification of homosexuality within your community, because having it as a taboo necessarily increased the value of the cult's orgies - and the magnitude of the threat of being discovered either having gay sex without them, or being treacherously exposed upon having it with them if you weren't in their good graces.  The fear of that reprisal usually kept people to task.\n\nThe Vatican's Knights of Malta appear to have picked this recruitment mechanism up themselves and used it to foment wartime Germany.  I know for a fact it's being practiced in the U.S. in my area, and presumably nationwide.  I believe it's this idolatrous practice, which pulls whole nations in with its clandestine undertow and the covert social groupings capable of eroding away at the political structure and culture of entire societies, which God condemns for our behalf, just as He takes direct affront to the inherent idolatry.\n\nThis information surely needs to get out there - not only because persecuting the whole gamut of homosexual activities against the Will of the Creator is persecuting, but also because the workings of these cults and agendas needs to get exposed to stop them.  [Isaiah 47]  The alternative is to enjoin Babylon through passive enabling.  We also need to correctly understand Scripture and correct any error or mistranslation by those who seem to have either lacked the context for an accurate translation of the Hebrew and Greek on this matter or else may have been deliberately collusive.  We consistently find the normal, ordinary words for homosexual practices [avoided in the Greek and Hebrew](https://wordofawoman.com/2012/04/09/homosexuality-and-god-parts-5-and-6-pornoi-arsenokoitai-and-malakoi/) in favor of ones with otherwise weird connotations, like idolatrous ritual cult practices and man-enslavement.  It only seems to make sense in the context of this recruitment mechanism.\n\n

This is nonsensical.\n\n'Welcome', in law, is an invitation to enter.  *[Which is why 'Welcome' mats are a bad idea unless you want burglars you can't prosecute for breaking and entering.]*\n\nIn posting that, some countryman purports to have singlehandedly changed the existing immigration and naturalization laws We, the People have required for centuries.  He lacks the authority of course, which is why this is nonsensical.
It's understood what central banks are and do.  And while the ZeroHedge article doesn't do this, the globalists even make sure to cite that themselves in their alt-media and hype the fallacy that China and Russia don't have them, so they must be legit.\n\nAs we've seen in the articles I've presented, China has the Peoples' Bank of China, Russia has been taking massive ongoing loans from the IMF - most direct to the aristocracy - and both are pushing for the IMF-controlled SDR which seeks to make their currencies (and any others who've subscribed to the SDR plan) mere franchises of the SDR and eventually outmode them permanently.\n\nIn this the globalists are simply performing a '[limited hangout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout)' maneuver, hyping an already-exposed aspect of their hustle that they intend to get rid of anyway, while using that half-admission to bolster the perceived credibility of the new aspects of their hustle which are set to replace it.\n\nIn the U.S. for example, they've already been setting the Federal Reserve up to take the fall for the imminent economic collapse - a role it's been performing dutifully - while setting the BIS which gives the Fed its orders up to appear wise, far-thinking and the voice of reason.  Last I checked, the plan was to replace the Fed with the Treasury which was always mandated to coin gold and silver money per the Constitution - but utterly fail to admit that at this point the Treasury staffed with collusive officials doing the bidding of the BIS just as the Fed is.  So it'll look like a grand improvement when they swap out one for the other - unless the People do their homework and expose the fraud in advance.  Which has already started to happen.
It's a very recent concept that politicians are thought of as our leaders.  Politicians and the media tend to propagate that one.\n\nWe, the People ordained and established their offices and roles, delegated specific authorities to them, all so that they could be our public servants.  They work for us.  Their job is to implement our will - not just any old thing, but what we actually told them we wanted - and to uphold our rights and laws.\n\nGood government doesn't happen well purely on the honor system.  If there were legitimate courts of law, if there were accountability, personal avarice wouldn't be a big problem because their personal avarice couldn't get away with much.\n\nIt's the same with gun safety.  'Gun safety' isn't a justification to pre-empt other peoples' rights away; trying to get the government to violate the rights to other people is called subversion.  Accountability after guns aren't used safely, by having actual courts of law again and using them, is the obvious solution.

> People who escaped a [...] should not strive to recreate it in their new adopted home.\n\n> > In what way do bans on the clothing that people can wear accomplish this?\n\nBurqas do.  Burkinis, admittedly not.\n\nIt would be a lot tougher for people to run around a town terrorizing other people if there weren't coincidentally an accompanying cultural clothing trend that concealed all the identifying features of anyone wearing it.  Enacted and even mandated by the same cultural authority that mandates the acts of terrorism they can help conceal.  That's pretty darn convenient.\n\nWe've seen them compete in international swimming events.  Apparently facial concealment isn't required.  So why in burqas and some burkinis?
Why is that, d'you think?
I'm aware of Islam's peculiar recontextualization of the Christian 'Adversary' figure.\n\nA reminder that Islam only appeared in 610 A.D..  I don't find its mythology compelling, although the embedded covert organizing symbolism can be quite telling.\n\nJesuit-crafted Freemasonry also shares a lot of its "genii" symbolism, from which we get the word "genius".  The parent organization and its franchises seek to bribe significant individuals and groups to enjoin its metaphysically "in container" [read: spiritually dissociated], 'Left Hand' position by offering them whatever material things or fleeting successes they happen to think they want in return for their permanent complicity and collusion.  It's been an ongoing case of 'Let's Make A Deal' as they seek to effect a quiet, comparatively peaceful and low-key transition to a covertly unified 'New World Order'.\n\nThe primary means of resisting this effort is of course to insist on principle and spiritual or moral values.  Few do, in a covert venue where they're comparatively unconstrained.

Of course there are limits on our rights: They necessarily end right at whatever point they would start violating the rights of another citizen.  That doesn't mean their exercise before that requires anyone else's permission or consent.  For example, 'allowing two people to get married', (unless you're one of them, married to them or their parent or guardian), or  'allowing someone to own a gun'.\n\nFor the record, you absolutely can yell that in a theater if it's true.  But yes, accountability doesn't just vanish because someone is exercising their First Amendment rights.  They're still liable for any harm or encroachment their use of those rights cause for another citizen, and it's the same with the Second Amendment rights.  What we don't do is pre-emptively gag other citizens on the basis that they *might* use their free speech right in a way that violates the rights of other citizens... Yet bewilderingly, many people think it's fine to do that with the right to bear arms.

Many things are manifestly 'facts of life' without their being either lawful or morally right.  If you believe that 'being adult' means ceding rights to another, you may have that conflated with 'being a minor'.  If you believe that the office sanctifies the acts performed within it, you may need to learn about [color of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_\\(law\\)).\n\nIt's the job of the Supreme Court to rule on and interpret what We, the People ordained and established in the Constitution when we imbued offices of the federal government with their lawful authority and told them what they must do, and made clear specific examples of things which they may never, ever do.  To some extent the Supreme Court have been careful interpreters of our expressed political Will.  But they remain our public servants, and it would be preposterous to have those public servants unaccountable for their interpretations if they should drift and become increasingly tenuously-aligned with our expressed Will.  I believe that to be the case, and the People never ceded their authority to intervene directly in the case of such error.  They simply appointed interim public servants to act in their stead, in a lesser capacity.\n\nParallel: You own a company.  You hire a manager and go on vacation somewhere particularly nice.  While you're away, you learn that the new manager is in violation of their employment contract with you and doing all manner of things, most to the detriment of the company.  Do you then have the authority to return and dismiss the manager?  Common sense tells us that you do.\n\nSupplemental information and my full response on these issues is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5tib0a/if_you_want_to_be_patriotic_be_patriotic_in_every/ddnx223/) rather than repeat things unnecessarily.

This is because a jury was established to represent the whole of society, and if the whole of society deemed the results of your behavior mutually incompatible with the functioning of society itself - such as the recognition of basic rights like the right to life - however imperfect a solution capital punishment was, no better solution was known and society as a whole couldn't be the one to go.\n\nSecondly, in the U.S. at least we didn't used to be huge on jailing people.  If you committed a federal offense - and I believe there were only four types at the time - you could be sent to a federal penitentiary like Fort Leavenworth.  But other than that, the juries were more concerned with restitution and reparation for the victims of the crime.  At the time, crimes were either a violation of the limited authorities granted by the People to the federal government, or the violation of the rights of other citizens.  This remains valid law, as opposed to a crime being anything violating any statute which happened to drop out of a rogue legislator.\n\nCapital punishment was often the only recourse when the rights violation to the victim was something which was unremediable because it was too great.  Such as the taking of a life, for example.  Monetary compensation even to the survivors wouldn't be on the same level as the injury, no matter how large the sum.

If it helps, we've got the best chance at freedom we've had in ages.  The globalists' plans keep getting exposed, delayed and retooled, and [National Liberty Alliance](http://NationalLibertyAlliance.org/) is set to restore our original common law courts nationwide which will enable us to adjudicate these guys in a court of law and shut all these rogues down for good - along with rogue cops, mayors, CEOs, etc.  NLA is also working with other nations to do the same there, and could really use our participation at this point.
Not at all.  Anyone who's sufficiently familiar with the methods of those organizing and enacting the gradual subversion is aware of their use of "The Fool" Tarot card symbolism.\n\nUnder that heading symbols of recreation, frivolity, entertainment, sports, games, and of course jests are used to make the obreption and subreption appear as just an innocent, agenda-free harmless activity.  All the while of course the means are being planned, schemed and enacted.  At some point the social, economic and political erosion becomes too great for the majority of the People to ignore, which is about where the U.S. is at today - and where Asia will eventually find itself at this rate.\n\nBut earlier on typically just depicted using doubletalk having to do with recreation, children's activities, sports and jests.  You ought to see what L. Frank Baum was putting together back in the day.  ***[The Marvelous Land of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Land_of_Oz)*** in particular makes it particularly clear now that the effort is so much more fulfilled today.

Not at all.  I believe the questions you ask are core to the issue.\n\nParents used to teach them to their children.  Then they outsourced it to public education which removed Civics and moral values.  Centralized control of that education gradually shifted the public mindset.  We still have immigration and naturalization requirements to guarantee education and sworn allegiance to our laws and rights, but this again has been outsourced with very little control over the process because we lack the courts to discipline errant public servants enacting it.\n\nThe decades of subversion have removed from us exactly the structure which propped us up culturally, economically and politically like tent poles.  Education, moral values and principles, rights, laws, cohesion and a sense of civic duty - that sense of duty which makes it feel appropriate and expected to cooperate as citizens to collectively uphold what We, the People established - rather than wait helplessly for public officials to do it.  Or refuse to do it.\n\nSo we need to restore our education of principles, moral values, rights and laws despite naysayers who will claim that it's just 'conspiracy theory' and that the system is exactly the same as the day We established it.  It clearly isn't.  We need to work collectively to restore the common law courts We established (assuming you're in the United States, that is).  And then use those to compel our own public servants to uphold the law, Our rights, and the founding principles We established.\n\nIt's kind of a symbiosis, the People and basic principles.  We learn and uphold the principles, and they keep our system functioning.  The system then in turn supports the rights of the People and perpetuates the process.  Without the support of the People for principles, you're right.  The system invariably collapses.  In more enlightened ages that understanding was usually enough to keep the People supporting principles as the preferable alternative.  Today we're usually more preoccupied with ourselves individually - our lives, our jobs, our budget, our needs.  There's not much room for Civics.  But just as corporations are finding that there isn't much point to profit margins if the whole system is going under, the People will hopefully recognize that there's no use being self-involved and -motivated if that causes the whole thing to collapse.  It's pretty self-evident once it's presented.\n\nThat's why We used to maintain culture, values, standards and principles.  That's why We used to uphold rights and enforce laws.  That's why parents would teach it to their children, and ensure immigrants accepted them as a condition to naturalization.\n\nWe just got distracted.  One way or the other, that can't last.
I known you mean well, but it's poor netiquette to link someone to an hour-long video rather than a specific part making a specific point.  Doubly so when it fails to address the points just presented.\n\nAdditionally, per Scripture humans - with the exception of those collusive with the Beast - don't go to that Other Place in the afterlife.  It's primarily for the fallen angels.\n\nAmerican colonists wouldn't touch the King James, believing too much of it had been changed.  They stuck with the Geneva as do I, but even then study of the original Greek and Hebrew words are necessary for an accurate translation here as I showed above.\n\nIncidentally, the Pride effort has been a Vatican effort to subvert the original, calm, sane, rational gay rights effort that risked - from their vantage point - normalizing homosexuality and thus drastically blunting the effectiveness of its recruiting mechanism.  The "flood", for them, references "flooding out" a legitimately social effort or group with a counterfeit; some of the other symbolism they use there is some Babylonian symbolism that's so awful I'd prefer not to detail it directly outside a court of law.

Horrendous situation.\n\nIt's always so unconscionable for reporting to then shift to overdose statistics, then emphasize the danger of the substance and push an agenda to put teeth in existing prohibitions against it.\n\nIf it were legalized it would be available in measured, pharmaceutical exact dosages, laboratory-grade standards of safety, and government inspections for lab compliance.  That we *don't* have that due to the black ops profits generated by the 'War on Drugs' and the prison industry which relies on jailing people for victimless crimes is *causing* so many of these unmeasured overdoses, and putting adult and child lives at risk.  Irresponsible reporting.\n\nA horrendous situation.  And the reporting agenda is actively making it even worse.

We say that today, but it's actually inaccurate.\n\nWe've taken to calling 'given names' 'first names' and surnames or 'family names' last names, and that's blurred the concept.\n\n'Given names' are given to a child by the parents.  'Family names' belong to the family itself.  This is demonstrated not only by what the names are called, but also by the now-antiquated phrase used when keeping important heirlooms and estates 'in the family name'.\n\nThis is aside from the trend of media personalities taking their own 'stagenames' to be known as throughout their careers.

May I suggest that murder, mutilation, extortion and slavery are already banned in a number of select Western countries - whether they're motivated by religion or not - and that the underlying problem isn't the enactment of new laws but a lack of enforcement of our existing laws?  Muslims move into an area.  Fine.  They push for social concessions.  Arguably fine.  When those social concessions either quit being accepted or have successfully made sufficient inroads into the native law and culture, a call of jihad successfully wipes out the local culture and paves it over for good.  Native law enforcement is overrun and outgunned by the sheet numbers of this rampant movement of the People - the arriving  Islamic People.  They eventually impose their law and customs by means of roving dudes with rifles and religious tracts, checking up on the behavior of members of their community and enforcing the foreign laws and customs at gunpoint.  A Middle Eastern militia, essentially.\n\nWhat a good argument for the Western militias we were always required by law to have, and which have become so prevalently derided today.  Rogue shooty cops or droves of arriving terrorists wouldn't be as willing to try their chances if we actually remained a nation of citizens willing to collectively uphold our rights, law and form of Constitutional government against all comers  rather than outsourcing that to public employees who have so often demonstrated their own mutually-exclusive agendas and priorities.

[Both the CIA and the FBI were established by the Vatican's Knights of Malta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH1DpAk1kkA&t=27m8s).\n\nThey and the Vatican's [Jesuits](http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Paris-The_Secret_History_of_Jesuits_1975.pdf) have spent the life-cyle of the U.S. - including its founding and their establishment of the Freemasons - attempting to subvert and counter the Protestant Reformation which [had their number over a century ago](https://ia800309.us.archive.org/6/items/theTwoBabylons/TheTwoBabylons.pdf).\n\nThey'd been quite successful until recently, when the information has started to proliferate again via current technologies.

I'm glad OP presented this in /r/conspiracy, because that's exactly where it belongs.  (Sincerely, thank you /u/dumbdreamer!)\n\nThe trendiness of 'trans' has to do with an agenda by the NWO occultists.  The male/female 'nonbinary' concept is a reference to Hermes and a few other of the symbols in their mythos.\n\nThis information has been slow to come out because [the Vatican's role in the NWO](http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Paris-The_Secret_History_of_Jesuits_1975.pdf) isn't predominantly known at this point, let alone that of [the occultists for which they're fronting](https://archive.org/details/theTwoBabylons).  That role is set to [increase](http://redefininggod.com/2016/08/how-the-new-world-order-agenda-drives-the-planet-x-nibiru-myth/), by the way.\n\nIt goes all the way back to the Babylonian Gnostic 'mystery priests', and their effort has been tracked from the original Babylon, Chaldea and Sumeria through the Medo-Persian empire, into the Greek, through the Roman, and then the Roman Empire went underground and opted to present as a church in response to legit Christianity.  There is also [compelling evidence](http://youtu.be/gTL0PM9CdNE) that they developed Islam wholesale as a way to pave over the legit Christians in the Middle East without taking the PR blowback for themselves.\n\nTheir occult symbolism presents as Christian, but is instead rife with [Dagonist](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vatican/esp_vatican138.htm) and [Mithraic](http://granddesignexposed.com/sun/baal.html) symbolism.\n\nResult: Running the NWO effort on behalf of the Babylonian occultists - the Gnostic 'mystery priests' - their various fronts and franchises have been enacting agendas which apply their occult symbolism, particularly that of Hermes who signifies them, and bring it to the fore.  And we end up with social movements, an alt-media and often mainstream media which legitimatize gender dysphoria as a civil rights issue.

Mohammed's experience as you describe it is textbook symbolism used by these guys to denote a 'Left Hand' group affiliation.\n\nThat is, out for personal and organizational gain in violation of every righteous thing.  Typically it's a form of self-disclosure.\n\nYou'll find an excellent summary of it [here](http://redefininggod.com/understanding-the-nwo-strategy/), under, *'With this in mind, have a look at the Masonic art outside of the New Carrollton Federal Building in Lanham, Maryland…'*.  The whole article is worth a read though.\n\nOnce their 'Left Hand' factions have gone in, dug in, and taken control over an area the typical strategy is to make them as blatantly awful as possible to gain public disapproval, while bringing out their 'Right Hand' franchises to say and do all the right things and gain public support.  The U.S. for example is currently in that mode.  By contrast, Japan is just starting to get subverted and so their franchises will present using as much 'sweetness and light' as possible.

However unaware you are at the Jesuit Counterreformation being the basis for the lifespan of our country, its founding, their founding of Freemasonry, and the Vatican's use of ancient occult symbolism to coordinate its efforts, the statue is nevertheless an Americanized recreation of the idol Inanna.  Specifically, a 'Left Handed' implementation of her.  The Colossus of Rhodes was likely the cover story to keep the nation's Freemasons - who identify with ancient Greek symbolism - from asking too many questions.  At least the ones who were unaware that Freemasonry was a tool established by the Jesuits as part of their Counterreform efforts.

I really hope it passes. Suppressors are only on the NFA list because people thought they worked in the movies, completely silencing the gun, so no one could hear them.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, a suppressor only makes the gun so it won't rupture your eardrum if you fire it indoors. There is still a loud bang, and if you're using supersonic ammo (which is more common than people think) there will still be a loud crack. \n\nIt's a big boon for hunters, as they commonly don't wearing hearing protection because they need to hear what's around them, and the suppressors would greatly help. It's also a boon for home defense guns, as it will make the difference whether a person gets tinnitus or not in a home defense situation.\n\nI can understand some of the items on the NFA list (like explosives), and can understand the reasoning behind certain NFA bans (like automatics, even though it's kind of bullshit), but suppressors do not belong on that list.

It wasn't the exhaust port that was the flaw, it was the main reactor. The original Death Stars reactor was intentionally designed badly so that even a handheld blaster hitting it would cause it to explode. The exhaust port being hit caused a chain reaction that hit the reactor ever so slightly (which caused it to go boom)\n\nThe second Death Star was actually a completely different design. The first Death Star could fire a shot once every 24 hours (regardless of power usage). However the second one was improved so well it could fire a shot every THREE MINUTES. Plus, I believe the second Death Star was larger than the first. Not only that, but the reactor was WAY stronger, that it took two proton torpedoes, and several concussion missiles directly hitting it to take it out, and even then it didn't immediately explode.\n\nIt's safe to say the found the flaw, and fixed it. I'm sure if the second Death Star had been completed, the rebels would have never stood a chance.

Matter into energy and into other matter is confirmed in Fallout. The Big MT Facility in New Vegas utilized this technology in the Sierra Madre. 
Reported for trying to brigade. That is not acceptable under TOS and sets a bad image for the little pile of shit we have made here
I thought the tin foil hats weren't used to protect against radio waves, but to protect against the CIA microwave thought controllers.... Because foil causes microwaves to bounce around (also causing heat)
MST3K did a very original take on the "Who's on first" skit, with their ["Kabuki and Noh Theater"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa-Kx5M-8Ak) sktech. It was probably the only redeeming thing about that episode... Oye a bad movie they watched.
I had this happen once... a guy stuck a note on my door, saying it was good to heavy a healthy sex life, but I needed to keep it down.\n\nI hadn't had sex for months at that time... I'm wondering if he heard my cats fighting, or a different neighbor
Padme has it too to a lesser extent.\n\nAlso, TIL I have competitive shooters arm.
Utah really does a good job on those road signs. And I'm willing to bet they actually help too.
If they show pretty much the entire story in the trailer. Like, the plot, the twists, and the resolution.
Giant robots doing king fu? \n\n....yeah ok I'd watch that.
I will never play Witcher 3.\n\nI genuinely like Fallout 4.\n\nWorld of Warcraft, Mists of Pandaria was actually a decent expansion pack (excluding the fucking pandas)\n\nDLC is not a bad thing, done well.\n\nMorrowind sucks.\n\nEDIT: Burning Crusade was also the worst expansion of World of Warcraft!
The first time I used the PSG1 on a helicopter, and shot it in the cockpit, causing it to crash was an amazing moment for me...

Except you can answer wrong 95% of the time, and they'll never notice.
"Assault rifle"\n\nWhen it was a bolt action rifle. The "journalist" who wrote this probably saw it was a big black rifle, and immediately thought it was an "assault rifle"\n\nAlso, some FFL in Arizona ordered a $7000 rifle, and instead got a toy plane because of this
I used to be that way. I would jump every time a gun would be fired, even when wearing hearing protection (seriously, wear hearing protection when firing guns.)\n\nI got over it after being around them enough. It's something you just get used to over time, as you begin to expect it
And all trade was done through a single, oppressive organization, consisting of mostly unpaid robot drones. Talk about a serious 1% problem
Apparently animals can report crimes in GTAV
It really does... Ok, yeah the story isn't as good as New Vegas, thats for damn sure, and yeah, the dialog is bad (Bethesda even admitted it was a mistake, and won't do it in the future)...\n\nBut the combat, the world, the overall feel... It really surpasses the other two fallout games. People forget so quickly just how clunky the combat was in New Vegas, and especially in 3, or the bugs that would just outright crash the game (New Vegas was especially guilty of this.) Or how the worlds didn't have much in them. Fallout 3 was closer to "Subway Station game", and New Vegas was actually fairly EMPTY compared to 3 or 4. It's why its so popular with modders, because it doesn't have as much as the other games in terms of locations and things to do.\n\nI remember in a post a while ago, where someone commented that if Fallout 4 did not have the brand of Fallout on it, everyone would be jizzing their pants at the game... An open world, post apocalyptic game with a HEAVY focus on customization for your playstyle? It would have had people shut up about the "perfection" that is Witcher 3...
And how, praytell, would you be able to have it be illegal WITHOUT causing the million and one problems prohibition causes? 
Look up Yuuzhan Vong, then look at the weapons they use. Then look at every weapon the empire designed, and realized every weapon they made was to fight against the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\nIn the EU, the new republic has to fight the Yuuzhan Vong. They win, but at the cost of over 300,000,000,000,000 sentient beings. How many would have been saved if the empire had been around?
That I somehow, someway, suddenly get enough money so I can quit my shitty, stress inducing, overwork causing job, buy out my lease, and move to Seattle to go to school for an aerospace engineering degree...\n\nSadly that would cost WELL over $10,000, and my shitty job doesn't pay much at all... so I'm stuck for a while

Gun control advocates not only allow outright ignorance of firearms, the encourage it to ensure people think they are a threat, so they can be banned.

A better joke would be banning high-capacity gas tanks. No one needs to drive over 100 miles at a time!
Yes, but they are brighter, and more efficient, therefore could be used to blind people before hitting them with their 2000 pound death machine!\n\nNo, people should only use the lower quality, less bright, easier to break lights. So criminals don't use them, obviously!

Late to the party, and not a manager, but a specific employee comes to mind.\n\nHe was hired about half a year after I was, to work in the same department. As standard practice, certain benefits don't come into effect until 90 days after being hired. Mostly vacation and 401k.\n\nThis guy came in, and was admittedly a bit pretentious. Fancied himself an MMA fighter, kept talking about how amazing he was in his social life (and in the ring)... and basically acted better than everyone else. I should point out this "professional" MMA fighter was thinner than me, and I don't consider myself CLOSE to fit.\n\nHis work ethic, on the other hand, was a bit sub par. He was supposed to assist me in various tasks in a diffusion bay (this was in the semiconductor business), but he never did, claiming he was helping other bays. Well, as he wasn't exactly up to par, his 90 trial was extended to 180 days.\n\nHowever, he kept working, even if it was barely above passing, and then, 180 days later, he got his benefits, and was made a permanent employee. Literally five minutes after being told, he decided to go on a half hour bathroom break without telling anyone.\n\n When he came back, the manager asked him where he had gone. The guy told the manager he had gone to the bathroom, at which point the manager said, "For half an hour? You shouldn't take bathroom breaks that long."\n\nThe guy then stormed out of the building. We all thought he had quit.\n\nUntil he came back a week later, acting like nothing happened. When the manager told him he had been fired for having three no call no shows, he got upset because he thought "permanent employee" meant "cannot be fired for any reason".\n\nMethinks he took one too many hits in the head being a "professional" MMA fighter.
The movies are just rebel propaganda. Of COURSE the sith are jerks in their films about the "glorious" jedi 
I concur on Morrowind. It's just so badly designed, even for its time!
Or how about the scene where they are in the Jedi prison, and are in ventilation shafts, but the bladed doors suddenly close, cutting a clone trooper in half (off screen).\n\nOr all the times people got their necks snapped by various Sith (you can hear the bones cracking and all)
Men in Tights was the first movie he ever acted in.

That's kind of the problem with California gun control. It's not about actually lowering crime, it about appealing to voters with what sounds scary, and banning it.

Less features to maintain or fuck up.
Then said it was removed from the list under their leaderships watch. As if it was fixed. They used it as a proposed accomplishment. Whatever I don't expect you to grasp these things. I'm done. 5meta7u
You completely missed all of the context. 2meta4u
Fixed like that issue with great barrier reef.
Okay. Come back when you learn to express yourself
Not sure this is the best time to submit videos like this but I thought it was good. Community will likely not give this too much love cause it isn't on the "hate train." Doesn't mean it's bad though! Keep at it. 
You're getting made fun of because you can't read and you call him salty?\n\nlmao
Uh for some of us the game isn't "free", we spent money in game. Just because you didn't spend money doesn't mean we can't raise a fuss. I'm fact maybe your opinion doesn't fucking matter compared to someone who did spend money. Almost like someone who didn't buy Diablo 3 bitching about the endgame. You aren't even in the conversation.\n\nThe devs made the game for people who spent money. Those people have a right to complain when core features are gutted. Just because you didn't contribute doesn't mean you can negate the opinion of people who shouldered your free-to-play weight. 
Problem: Child Porn.\n  \nSolution: Remove reproduction feature from human types. Remove children currently spawned.\n\nI almost said they would add a tracking feature for children but we know that would get removed.\n
Nah. Brb getting marshmallows. You bring the chocolate? Who is getting graham crackers?
Don't break out the cookies if you ain't gonna share with the class.
Thanks for getting back to me. I will continue to play this game. When things are a bit more stable I will be sure to spend that money again. I value your humble appreciation of our support and look forward to your success!
Yup. Three step wasn't a bug.
And I know you don't read enough.
Quality drawing, great for reading. 6/7.
Quality shitpost. To the top with you.
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Niantic+CEO+tracking\n\nHe said that they would be taking steps to stop that. Shortly after feature is removed and tracking is stopped.
I didn't know this. Thanks for sharing.
Relative velocity? As in velocity relative to your perspective.
Dude. You are actually missing the context.  Not trolling. Australia claimed fixed the great barrier reef by simply removing it from the list of issues..... simply put. 4meta6u
It has uses but not its intended uses. Which is my point. The game can still be played but not the way it was intended or the customer expected to. We have every right to be pissed. If the community is filled with negativity it's because it is warranted. This forum is for the community and that is the way the community feels. /thread\n\nThere was no strawman fallacy. I bet you feel smart using those words doe!
You sound really passive aggressive and selfish.
Dude it was just a "minor text fix".... in the code.
It get harder the greater your trainer level. It get kinda stupid above level 20. It's possible the new patch made new problems though. I don't know if it did.
Seek a professional therapist help. I'm not being funny, or mean. You sound like you are working through some rough emotions. Professional help is nothing to be ashamed of and does wonders. Your mental health is important. Feel better friend.
It's real money. Niantic gets that money. It's currency that can be exchanged for goods and services.  \n\nAn interesting example is EVE online where there is a market based rate for buying game time with in game currency. This means you can create an exchange rate for game currency and real money  (that you bought game time with). Except in your case it's a 1:1 exchange and you actually give that real money to niantic.
Ikea. You have to be brain dead to not build it right.
No problem. I hope I didn't come across as a dick. I wasn't sure I understood the question hence my question mark. Best of luck in your learning!
# #Dank #Rekt /thread
"Fixed" doesn't mean it isn't still referred to sadly.
13% may just be the number that spent money. This is free to play. A small portion contribute.
They didn't state that as the reason they removed it. The state reason was tracking sites.
That's how life works. It's not a "reddit thing".
Search: resign\n\nFuck.
You know what's not helping. No communication from them. They have managed to break literary everything in this game. Literally. Can't track 'em. Can't catch 'em. If you get 'em it changes so it ain't what ya caught.  \n\nLiterally every step of the whole process is fucked . If they rolled back to release version the game would be seen as patched.
She doesn't work for a business. She works for a government entity \n\n
Yea, stop calling it a bug. Call people out on it. You are correct. Do not let them off the hook for gutting a feature.
And yet here you are
Have your credit card reverse the charges. They made a fraudulent game and violated the play stores terms of service (no direct contact with the company).
Lol stereotype m'right guys? Sounds like you went and smoked with them and disregarded the culture of passing properly.
Like we don't know that. There is a logical connection of resource draw and cost. *sigh* /r/Iamverysmart
Okay. I think I have this bug too but I'm bitching and haven't played in a while.
No pledge to be made\n Many of us are done. We are getting refunds and not returning
Idk ask your mom OP.
Looks like Niantic PR is back.
BLM, this is how you lose credibility. This demand is 100% unreasonable and will never happen. Furthermore, its completely racist. It's one thing for your defenders to pin the racism on some fringe people but this removes that defense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Reparations for the systemic denial of access to high quality educational opportunities in the form of **full and free access for all Black people** (including undocumented and currently and formerly incarcerated people) to lifetime education including: free access and open admissions to public community colleges and universities, technical education (technology, trade and agricultural), educational support programs, retroactive forgiveness of student loans, and support for lifetime learning programs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor all the people that said saying "all lives matter" showed ignorance in the face of their issue, I understand your argument and for a while agreed. The issue they want to bring up is specifically black lives being undervalued. I think we can all appreciate the idea and the value in discussing the issue on a national level. There is certainly work to be done. But when you want to lift black lives out of poverty and leave non-blacks to continue to suffer in impoverished regions you are misguided. Many people in those situations are there through no fault of their own, they all deserve opportunity. To ignore your brothers and sisters (referencing all races of people) in this struggle is awful, racist, and continues to perpetuate the racist assumptions that all black people just want free handouts or that they only got to where they are because they are black. You are literally making that stereotype exist, you undermine all black people that deserve their accomplishments. For that, fuck you.
You didn't address the argument. I will not respond further.
Last patch I lost a 10k
No you didn't. We put money into a game that then had a core features gutted. We are pissed. It's like if there was only one maker of bicycles and they said they needed to remove the fucking handle bars... after we bought better tires, better brakes, better frames. "But, but, but the bike was free so it's fine they only took the handlebars!!! It's still fun coasting around a bit. And you can turn it upside down and spin the tires which is cool. I don't get why you guys complain. It still works the way I use it."
Shit post and nostalgia? You know what to do boys! Take it to the top!

What you did could have killed someone and you did it because you didn't want to get in "trouble"
They are too busy removing features. They will add more when they are done removing everything else. Kappa
I'm literally concerned for your well being and it seems other are too. I don't know why you think I'm being mean. I'm encouraging you to seek help in working through these emotions.
Someone already posted this in new. Exact same image. Fuck off.
Literally still missing context and doesn't know it. 3meta5u
You didn't even give credit to (satire) Niantic twitter that said this. Shame on you. 
Ditto has not been seen (that we know of) You are incorrect.
Too good.
A company like Nintendo knows. Us informing them doesn't change that.
OP
This bot is still learning. Be gentle guys.
You literally said to brigade them. LITERALLY
Idk ask a holocaust survivor.
Nothing broke. 3 step issue was to reduce server load. They removed it because putting it back in means buying more shit
Also if someone ahead keeps looking at your doggo, let them know they can pet it. If they feel uneasy they will feel better knowing it is friendly and if they want to pet it your doggo gets love.
Not that I know of. Would be a cool easter egg though!
They didn't state the reason the made 3 footsteps afaik. They did say they removed it entirely because of cheating.
I don't man. Just because you are going through a rough time doesn't mean there is something wrong with you. We have all been through rough shit. Very few people are lucky not to get raked over the coals at least once in their life.
The two happened at the same time. I don't really see a reason to think it was a bug. I'm half wondering if they took it out all together because they can't afford to put it back in. The tracking sites was probably a shitty excuse.
Sounds like whining
Aww shit a bug. Niantic has to remove the coin feature now.
Niantic took out a core advertised feature before adding anything. They know what they are doing. This sub acts like Niantic is just a drooling fool of a company. These are informed choices they are making to achieve their goals. At some level there is a logic to it.\n\nMy bet, they planned on failure. They pushed release in as many countries as possible as fast as possible. They gutted features to make it happen because there is no long term goal. It didn't matter if they lost people because they didn't plan on keeping them.\n\nProbably got the IP on bullshit claims of capability and made plans to maximize profit before sinking. Failure was planned for and we see that in their actions.\n
You know how jokes aren't funny of you must explain them? This is one of those cases.
He ded
You ain't gonna change a hurricanes direction by farting against the wind man. Just batten down and get out the popcorn. It's gonna be windy for a bit.
Uh yea dude. Go get help. You may be able to get through it on your own but at a minimum a therapist will help you get control back faster. Plus you don't want to wait till it is too late and you did something you regret.
Read new submissions before attempting to submit. This is literally being spammed. Everyone knows.
Three step issue. It was not a glitch.
That's for fucking sure. How can you finish a game when you only remove features? Kappa.
Well said
What color was the gym and what is your team?
Mods can you please please please flair this as a complaint.
Can I have a refund?
Many used the tracker websites while waiting for the feature to come back when Niantic could handle the server load. The feature was removed entirely and does not look like it will make a return.
It's pretty difficult to get the AI to do 'exactly' what you want because the AI behavior FSMs are pretty complex. I don't know much about the Zeus interface but you can use scripting to allow fine control of the AI, for example you can use the disableAI 'pathplan' command to make the AI walk between waypoints in a precisely straight line. You can use disableAI 'MOVE' if you want an AI entiry to remain in one spot no matter what. You can combine this with stance commands to make AI stand in doorways and on rooftops etc.
We already have flying cars - they are called helicopters. There's a lot of good reasons (besides the burden of becoming a licensed pilot) why everybody doesn't own a helicopter as well as a car for getting around.\n\nPeople seem quite enamored with the idea of upsizing a multirotor to the size where it could carry people, but with an aircraft of that size, I suspect a conventional helicopter would be a more efficient design - which is going to be the name of the game if you want the thing to fly on battery power.\n\nMultirotors make sense for small craft because a cyclic rotor system is too complex (expensive) and/or fragile so it's easier to use multi engines and  differential thrust for control.\n\nBut an article that says we should build pilotless electric helicopters for rich people isn't going to get many clicks I suppose.
>That is not a fair representation of his opinion. \n\nIt's exactly what he said.\n\n>You should watch the video, if you have, try being honest.\n\nI did.

He thinks 13 year olds can give consent. \n\n\n
NYT headline: "In 77 chaotic minutes, Trump defends fine tuned machine"
I learned about Soviet NBC doctrine during my time in the Army (CBRN was one of my specialisations) but the book 'The Dead Hand' by David E. Hoffman has some good info about the Soviet Chemical forces (although it's focus is on the strategic nuclear forces), although I don't think the book goes into too much detail on the tactical employment of chemical weapons.\n\nSome chemical weapons, such as V series nerve agents VX, VN, VB (Sarin, Tabin, Soman) and choking agents such as mustards will persist in the environment for some time, particularly if they are dispersed in liquid form. Mustard agents can even start off gassing and become dangerous again after being frozen on the ground for weeks.\n\nThe idea is that as your armored divisions advance you can spray key locations on your flanks with chemical agents from helicopters or artillery shells to prevent the enemy from attacking a vulnerable flank, because nobody is going to intentionally attack through a contaminated area, even if they possess an NBC protection capability. Then after a few days the agents will break down (mainly due to UV exposure for nerve agents) and the ground will be safe to traverse for your follow on forces.\n\nBridges and airfields are also great targets for chemical attack because you can contaminate them ahead of your advance to disrupt the enemies ability to destroy them before you can reach them, meaning you have a good chance of capturing them intact. The destruction of bridges and crossing points was one of the main concerns for any advance across Western Europe, so chemical agents were seen as a potential option to prevent this.\n
I can understand why BIS probably wouldn't provide switches in the Zeus interface because it would probably cause more problems for Zeus players, turning off path planning means that the AI won't avoid obstacles so if there's a tree or a building along the waypoint path then the AI will run straight into it and get stuck, which would probably be equally infuriating for players.\n\nIt's quite difficult to strike a balance between the extremes of "The AI doesn't do what I want" and "The AI is so dumb, they don't even do X when Y happens" but BIS does a pretty good job I think. \n\nThe script from QS_Iron will do the job of switching off the combat and cover behaviours for entities created in Zeus, it might be a little hard to read if you're not experienced with scripting, if you want to play around with scripting you can just place individual scripting commands in a units 'init' field from the mission editor such as ( this disableAI 'AUTOCOMBAT' ) etc
Not today but on the Friday, spent the day cutting up timber in the backyard and the next morning I noticed a pain on my thigh, looked like a nasty ingrown hair so I got a scalpel and opened it up to get at it turned out to be a spider bite, maybe a white tail or similar. Got worse before it got better, but is pretty much fine now. 
You are unlikely to find a source within US doctrinal publications that will state that 'airpower' was the focus over ground forces. \n\nAs the saying goes, you cannot take or hold ground with aircraft. Ground forces will always play the decisive factor in theatres like Europe with airpower acting as an enabler, hence the US conceptual doctrine of the 'air-land battle' (sounds familiar right?) \n\nThe key concern for US forces in the cold war (putting the nuclear forces to the side for the moment) was the Soviet Union's large numbers of conventional forces based in East Germany and central Europe. After the end of World War 2 the US and Western European Allies disbanded large parts of their conventional forces, this, combined with other priorities such as the occupation of Japan led to an inbalance of forces in central Europe in the USSR's favor.\n\nNATO was concerned that the USSR could use it's numerical superiority in armored formations to steam roll NATO forces and occupy western Europe. Tactical airpower in the form of fighter bombers and a focus on airborne and air mobile forces were part of Soviet doctrine, so in a sense the role of airpower in relation to ground forces was similar in the USSR as it was in the US. The Soviets did have some unique tactics at the operational level though, such as the use of persistent chemical agents on the flanks of advancing forces to deny NATO the ability to strike at an exposed flank.\n\nIt was the nuclear deterrent more than anything else that prevented a conventional major power war on the European mainland (thus far). Dan Carlin just released a great podcast on the Cold War a few weeks ago on Hardcore History, while it focuses on the nuclear build up he does describe the situation for the conventional forces on both sides in central Europe,  and that would be a great place to start if you want to learn more.
Depends on where the shuttle is in respect to the rupture in the tube and how much air can get through the rupture. \n\nIf the rupture is behind the shuttle then the air is going to rush in and create a situation where there is a pressure differential on either side of the shuttle, kind of like how there is a pressure differential in the barrel of a gun on either side of a bullet when it is fired, so probably the opposite of slowing down is going to happen to the shuttle.\n\nThe other case is when the rupture happens ahead of the shuttle, in which case the shuttle, which is designed to operate in an evacuated tube, travelling at hundreds of kilometers and hour, hits a wall of air going the opposite direction at hundreds of kilometers an hour, in which case, some slowing down is likely to occur in whatever debris is left of the shuttle and it's occupants.
The precision of the analog input is declared in the USB descriptor file that will be included in that library file (sry on phone atm so can't check) I think the spec for HID devices allows 8 analog axes and maybe 64 digital buttons per HID device, so you should have ample inputs for your project. \n\n16 bit precision is certainly possible as long as it's declared in the device descriptor.
Hey no worries, I'd recommend trying to get your products into a shop, because it's a great way to get decent feedback on your products, I don't really regard online comments, forums etc as good feedback because you might get 100 people check out your stuff online but only one person might leave a comment, so it's hard to tell whether that one comment is representative of your customers. \nWhereas if you've got your stuff in a store you can check back in with them after a few weeks and the shop guys should be able to give you a good summary of the general vibe of how their customers are responding to your products, so if they are getting a lot of feedback ie 'they are too expensive' , 'people love them' etc you can use that feedback to improve your stuff.\n\nAlso, if you can get them in the shops then every hour that shop is open you might get a potential sale without any effort on your part, you don't have to worry about shipping etc, it's a lot easier to sell if you can get your stuff into a shop\n
Yeah certainly the air will try and find it's way around the shuttle, but the hyperloop isn't like a regular train where there is a lot of room between the carriages and the tunnel wall, in order to maximize efficiency the hyperloop will need to have the size of the shuttle and the inner diameter of the tube to be as close as possible. When the wall of pressurized (relative to the air in the tube) air hits the shuttle, assuming the shuttle is not completely obliterated it's going to get carried with the wall of air until the air in the tube equalizes, which means the wall of air and the shuttle are going to hit the station at the end of the tube at whatever speed the air is propagating down the tube.\n\nWith regard to safety precautions, you are right, you would need to have some way to rapidly repressurize  the tube in the event it was perforated in order to prevent the scenario above, now if you have one continuous tube you would need to have lots of valves all up and down the tube that could all bleed air into the tube in a controlled manner, at the same time you are going to have to slow the shuttles to a speed that they can operate in regular air. That means that a single breach would stop the entire line (keeping in mind there are going to be many shuttles in a single tube). Now the solution to this is obvious, you build lots of (expensive) air locks into the tube so that in the event of a breach you can isolate a part of the tube and not have to depressurize the entire line. The complicating factor is that you need to have the air locks far enough apart so that a shuttle can safely decelerate from hundreds of kilometers an hour to full stop before colliding with an airlock, so you're going to need a lot of them so you can decide which ones to close based on where the shuttles are and where the breach is, or have them far enough apart that you are going to lose the efficiency of having them in the first place.\n\nThunderf00t on YouTube did a great vid on the hyperloop and he did the math which didn't look good for the feasibility.\n\nMy take on it is that basically you are building an aircraft fuselage (except it has to be stronger) from where you are to where you want to go, and dealing with the challenges of keeping it in the air permanently. Then the hard engineering challenges start. Better off using aircraft.
Hey I'm not sure about the specifics of music equipment retail but generally if you're a new company looking to get products into a local store they will most likely ask you to offer your products on consignment, which means you provide them with some of your products for a period of time and they will only pay you for the products that they sell. \n\nThe benefit of selling product on consignment for the store is that if nobody buys them, or there's some other problem then the shop is not going to be stuck with product that it's already paid for but can't sell. This transfers the risk from the store onto you, because you'll have to bear the costs of getting the products made and will only make your money back after the items have sold. It kinda sucks for you but it's basically the standard way to get your foot in the door.\n\nThe answer to the other question you had about the margins that you'd offer a store will probably require a little investigative work on your part to work out what the typical margins on similar products are, because you will need to offer a store a better margin than competing products as an inducement to carry your products over a competing product that they already stock.\n\nThink of it this way, a local store is already stocking similar products to what you're offering (I assume) so essentially what you're asking them to do is take away shelf space for these tried and tested products to put yours in their place. If they are not going to make a better margin on your product than your competition then you are basically asking them to make their business less profitable, which is a pretty big ask on your part.\n\nHopefully you've got a friend in a store somewhere that could give you some hints on what the regular margins for similar products are, the suppliers obviously try and keep this information highly confidential, so it's not going to be easy to find without some help.\n\nIf you can offer a local store a better product that is more profitable for them to sell and they don't have to take the risk of buying their first order upfront then it's a win win win for the local shop and they are more likely to take on your gear.\n\nBest of luck with the business! \n
>Eh, I work in the fashion industry and wear jeans and sneakers to work most days but putting on a suit can be fun and makes you feel great.\n\nPutting on a suit is not fun for me and doesn't make me feel great. I feel that the suit is one of the worst designed, most useless garments ever made. you have a jacket which is too thin and doesn't protect you from the elements, the chest is open FFS so good luck in the cold or the wind or the rain. The pants are similarly flimsy and are easy to rip and stain. Unless you spent a lot of money or went supercheap on polyester it's going to wrinkle the minute you put your seat belt on and stay wrinkled all day. The shoes are hard and uncomfortable to stand in for even an hour let alone all day, then to top it all off you get to wear a tie all day long which is of course the absolute most useless piece of clothing every invented in the history of mankind. \n\nWhat about sweating all day long in a suit and a tie is fun for you? \n\nAnyway.....\n\nWe are not talking about places where you get to wear jeans one day and a suit the next day. We are talking about places where you wear a navy  suit every day. 
Exactly.
We do have car control laws. We have mandatory insurance, strict licensing requirements, registration of cars, inspection of cars etc.
> I thought that was pretty fair.\n\nYour opinion doesn't matter because you are not a part of the negotiations.\n\n>I didn't lie. \n\nYes you did. You lied when you said they never compromised and never made an offer. Those were lies.\n\n>that they have never formally agreed to anything that didn't give them everything they want.\n\nI didn't agree with that. You are lying again. I agreed they haven't accepted the offers so far. They have never had an offer that has given them everything they want.\n\nAlso I pointed out where you lied multiple times. You are a liar.\n\n>Israel has agreed to compromise agreements.\n\nIsrael has a series of preconditions which they will never compromise on so there won't be any peace.\n\n>What does it explicitly deny that they want?\n\nthe 48 borders.
I am surprised the number is this low. I mean it's a pretty well established fact by now.
That has nothing to do with this story.
People are tired of blue dog democrats.  They do more harm then good.  For example the main reason Obama took the public option off the table was because the blue dogs opposed it. 
Well does make America pay for his son's to travel to Dubai and build new golf courses so....
>I think they're all considering the argument put forward, rather than deciding that it sounds offensive so let's crucify the guy.\n\nThat makes them shitty human beings does it not?\n\n>I think what they're all saying is that most 14 year olds aren't mentally and emotionally in a place where they can meaningfully consent, but perhaps some are.\n\nAnybody who thinks a 14 year old is capable of giving consent to sex needs to have their head examined.
Gun control is happening. I know you don't like it but it's happening. Step by step it's happening.
OK. I now understand you want gay men to molest 14 year old boys if they decide the boy is mature enough for it. 
>By this logic, why don't Americans seem to mind NSA internet surveillance? \n\nI don't think the situations are similar. Yes the NSA does monitor our activities but as of today it does not try to hinder those activities for everybody.\n\n
>A strong unified response - tell China it must abandon legal claims to the land (didn't some international court rule against them already as to that point?) and abandon military plans for its use.\n\nOr else what?\n\n>You ask am I going to "go to war with China". The answer is that I would lead the world in a unified message, and actions, that might lead to war - yes. I don't believe China would risk war if they believed we were strong in our conviction.\n\nI think China knows the world would not dare enter into a war with China. Look at you. Even a war mongering monster is pussyfooting around the idea.\n\n
Why can't the older man help the child without having sex with him?
Why aren't t you advocating for sex with five year old children. It's just a magic number right?
How is he a victim?  He said it's perfectly normal for grown men to have sex with children because he enjoyed his experience so much. 
Has anybody ever seen this black boyfriend? 
Everybody needs money so no matter who is fighting who or who wins they will sell the oil. Even ISIS is selling the oil FFS.\n\nThe oil will flow no matter what.
Hey Mr president.  You get briefings every morning.  Pay attention! 
Everybody needs money so no matter who is fighting who or who wins they will sell the oil. Even ISIS is selling the oil FFS.\n\nThe oil will flow no matter what.
>Isn't that how negotiations usually work?\n\nNo.
I see more assertions. I don't see any any actual information.
Time will tell.  If these people start getting less airtime we'll know for sure. 
I guess gaza is one of the few places in the world which still has the death penalty. Here is more information about that.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/29/death-penalty-countries-world\n\nGaza doesn't make the top ten when it comes to most executions.
So you are advocating for gay men to have sex with 14 year old boys right? 
I am sure this law is going to strike fear into the hearts of all five people it will effect.
I have no idea what you are trying to say.\n\nLet me ask you this question.\n\nDo you agree with Milo that it's OK for gay men to have sex with 13 year old kids? \n\nThat's Milo's position. Do you agree with it? Do you support Milo?
What does this have to do with relativism? Can't the same question be asked of moral absolutists? What if God doesn't exist?
>They just need to give up attacking Israel.\n\nFatah did that and Israel responded by taking land and building more settlements.
Contiguous Palestinian state, full control over Jerusalem, borders as defined by the UN, full right of return.\n\nThat's just some of what the Palestinians want and is not in the arab peace initiative.
Trump could kill and eat a baby every day on television and his supporters would praise his taste in babies.
Everybody needs money so no matter who is fighting who or who wins they will sell the oil. Even ISIS is selling the oil FFS.\n\nThe oil will flow no matter what.
>And if we say "It's okay to knock down buildings as long as they're tall", do you feel safe in saying your favorite buildings will always be called short? \n\nI am not saying the person has to be destroyed so your analogy doesn't work.\n\nHow about this.\n\n"One should not go to jail for spray painting on a building".\n\nThat's a more apt analogy.
No the initiative doesn't say they get full right of return or full control over all of jerusalem. \n\n
You can't buy a car without registering it or insuring it.
What makes you say there was no trial?
Neither one.
Nah I wouldn't.\n\n150K isn't really that much and you'd spend a good chunk of that on clothing because whether you kept your job or not, whether you got a raise or not, whether you got a promotion or not would depend on your wardrobe.
Nothing wrong with protesting especially against racist pedophiles \n\nHow come you love child molesters so much anyway? 
>Well my biggest reason for skepticism about a final resolution is the apparent Palestinian unwillingness to make hard compromises. \n\nSame goes for Israel. Israel has way too many preconditions for peace to ever happen including no right of return, complete control over the Palestinian borders, airspace and waters, control over jerusalem, recognition as a jewish state etc.\n\n
Both of the Sphynx I have will chew on anything. I think that there's a joke about things in their mouths in there somewhere... They're definitely destructive little fucks, but I love them to death.
>They have never made or accepted any offer except the Arab Peace Initiative (which is no concessions).\n\nIt's true they have not accepted any of the offers put forward but that's because none of them were fair to the Palestinians.\n\nAs for offers made they have indeed made many offers and concessions. Even on issues very important to them like the right of return so you are flat out lying there. \n\n>Everybody has things that they need to happen in order to sign on the dotted line.\n\nYou seem to be agreeing with me here. There are many preconditions which Israel refuses to compromise on so that's why there will not be peace.\n\n>The problem is that for the Palestinians, that thing so far has apparently been "everything."\n\nThat too is a lie and from where I sit it seems to come from a place of bigotry and hate.
The BBC is fake news but Alex Jones is totally legit. 
>Basically, what I'm getting at is that it's a bad idea to advocate a precedent that some ideas are worthy of violence or suppression\n\nI disagree with you. Some ideas are definitely worth of violent suppression. We did in fact wage war with the Nazis to defeat their ideology.\n\n>And advocacy of genocide (not pointed threats), while it is a really awful idea, is still an idea, nothing more, until it is acted upon.\n\nbut it does get acted upon, just gradually. He continually calls for genocide knowing that his cult is dangerous and mentally unstable.  One of the cult members snaps one day and kills a handful of black people or muslims or whatever. \n\n> It can, and should, be deflated by counter-rhetoric, for reasons in my prior posts.\n\nSometimes words are not enough. All those people who stood by and did nothing as Hitler spoke, then did nothing as a jewish registry was formed, did nothing as the jews got rounded up and then finally maybe said or did something as the genocide started probably wish they had acted sooner.
> Well, that's true, but they are both arguments, the differences are only of content and severity.\n\nMy house and the Burj Dubai are both buildings the only difference is the height and the number of rooms.
Because republicans hate America. 
>That is not a fair representation of his opinion. \n\nIt's exactly what he said.\n\n>You should watch the video, if you have, try being honest.\n\nI did. He said it's OK for gay men to have sex with 13 year old boys because he doesn't think that's pedophelia. \n\n>What he is saying is on par with the victim of a sexual assault as a child.\n\nNo he doesn't recognize it was sexual assault. He thinks 13 year olds can give consent. \n\n\n
He says he wasn't. He says 13 year olds can give consent and that gay men should be able to have sex with 13 year olds.
>You better let them know that. Here is what they say they want.\n\nThat's the compromise they made.\n\nYou know when you said they never made any compromises? You lied. That's one of the compromises they made.
Why do the Palestinians need to give up things?  The Arab states said they would give bibi what he wanted. 
This is the kind of alternate facts we can expect from the war mongers.
The blue dogs got elected on the coattails of of Obama. They acted like republicans and then in the very next election they got booted because the voters figured if they were going to elect republicans no matter what they might as well vote for the republican.
Yes I do. i think that when democrats act like republicans the voters figure might as well vote for the real thing instead of this republican lite.
Did either one of those people advocate for child molestation like Milo did? 
Maybe the democrats could move to the left to gain some votes. 
Nothing can be done unless there is profit in it.  The fault lies in capitalism and unfortunately can't be cured by capitalism. 
That's what we have now. Neither party cares about good governance or the people who vote for them. \n\nThe democratic party seems to absolutely hate their base though. I have never heard any democrat on reddit say one kind word about any progressive. They hate them more than they hate trump.
I think it's crazy you guys are so sanguine about it.  Why not vote the fuckers out?
>What if there other places just like earth? With the same atmosphere composition, water and land? Places where we can breathe and our plants can grow?\n\nHow are you going to get there?\n\n
>Advocating universal principle instead of individual discretion means that good ideas that sound bad, or that have bad PR, or have big enemies, will have some chance of not being crushed by bad discretion, and that justice will be defined by principles, not by whoever can rouse the biggest rally.\n\nI am having a very hard time parsing this. Every morality is based on situational ethics. \n\n>If "You have the freedom to evaluate each and every situation and act in ways you think are best in those situations." is the bedrock principle, then the Nazis of their time were exercising their freedom, weren't they? \n\nOf course they were. And the people who oppose them were not which is why they won.\n\n> then where does that leave civility or shame of barbarity in the face of strongmen or idiot masses' right to simply exercise their freedom to do what they think is right?\n\nAll it takes for evil to win is for good men to do nothing. The Nazis won because so many people believed like you do and did nothing in the face of increasingly hostile rhetoric until it was too late.\n\n>? Should morality, as well as history, be just a function of the victors?\n\nIt is. Like it or not that's the way it works.
Looks like someone taking it from both ends to me
>Have you ever seen the movie Jack starring Robin Williams? It's not very good, but it's about a person who ages at 4 times the normal rate. Perfectly healthy, but obviously has 1/4 the normal life expectancy. Spoiler alert, but the movie ends with his graduating high school at, effectively, 72 years old.\n\nOk........\n\n\nSo you want to legalize having sex with children because of this movie?
Everybody needs money so no matter who is fighting who or who wins they will sell the oil. Even ISIS is selling the oil FFS.\n\nThe oil will flow no matter what.
We can't colonise any of the planets around other star systems.\n\nWe can't reasonably colonise any other planet in our own solar system.
Posting a story from times of Israel about Palestinians is the first clue eh?
In Israel maybe.
>  but they're still both arguments, and should be treated as such.\n\nI disagree completely. If somebody didn't like the latest episode of a TV show and I did I would treat that argument much differently than somebody who wanted to genocide Jews and I didn't.\n\n>Most ideas that are held up as "beyond the pale" can be dismantled just as easily-- hell, more easily, I'd suspect-- by counterarguments than with fisticuffs. \n\nTo who? To the racist person who wants to genocide Jews? No. There is absolutely nothing you can say to this person to get them to change their minds. They didn't reason into their position and they won't reason themselves out of it.  \n\n>Meanwhile, a Nazi with a sore face is still a Nazi, and probably one with a larger chip on their shoulder to boot. \n\nTrust me, Once you are done arguing with him he will still be a nazi too but he won't be in pain. If he is in pain after he is done talking out loud about killing jews he is less likely to do it again. Doesn't mean he won't, it means he'll be more careful where he speaks.\n\n
I'll need a cite for your claims.
Milo claims his boyfriend is black but nobody has seen this supposed boyfriend so maybe.....
> I thought that was pretty fair.\n\nYour opinion doesn't matter because you are not a part of the negotiations.\n\n>I didn't lie. \n\nYes you did. You lied when you said they never compromised and never made an offer. Those were lies.\n\n>that they have never formally agreed to anything that didn't give them everything they want.\n\nI didn't agree with that. You are lying again. I agreed they haven't accepted the offers so far. They have never had an offer that has given them everything they want.\n\nAlso I pointed out where you lied multiple times. You are a liar.\n\n>Israel has agreed to compromise agreements.\n\nIsrael has a series of preconditions which they will never compromise on so there won't be any peace.\n\n>What does it explicitly deny that they want?\n\nthe 48 borders and all of jerusalem.
>I said they never formally agreed to anything less than everything they want. If you disagree, cite it.\n\nNo you said they didn't compromise on anything and never made an offer. That was a lie.\n\n>They agreed to the Arab Initiative, which is everything they want.\n\nNo it's not. I already pointed this out. Everything they want would be the 1948 armistice lines and a contiguous palestinian state.\n\n>You keep saying that but it still doesn't make any sense. \n\nOK then I'll say it again.\n\nIsrael has a set of preconditions (which I have listed for you) on which they will never compromise so there can't be peace.\n\n>The "48 borders" is the exact same thing as the 67 lines\n\nNo it's not.\n\n\n
Milo is in favour of having sex with underage children. \n\nEnd of story.  There is nothing else to consider here.  There is no other character attribute which could mitigate or negate that. \n\nHe is a terrible human being who advocates for raping children. 
Nobody has ever seen this supposed black boyfriend though. 
So have the palestinians. \n\nBut Israel has some preconditions they refuse to budge from and that's why there can't be peace.
So he is saying that the age of consent is ok but that people especially gay men should be able have sex with people who are underage.\n\n
Sorry I didn't see anything on that page regarding your claims.
Doesn't matter. I would not trust any Israeli newspaper to report on Palestinians in an unbiased way.
What are you going to do? Go to war with China? Put sanctions on China?
>They don't claim West Jerusalem but it does give them all of East Jerusalem.\n\nThey want all of Jerusalem.\n\n>And it does call for 100% right of return.\n\nIt calls for this to be negotiated at a later date.
sexual fetishism is a big part of racism.  Many slave owners had sex with their slaves for example. \n\nHaving said that nobody has ever seen this black boyfriend be keeps bragging about. 
>If you think he is wrong on age of consent then he is a victim. You are not consistent.\n\nMany victims end up being abusers. He is one of those people. He molests children because he was molested. He also advocates for others to molest children.
That's 99.9999% of all roads in the country.\n\nBut yes I supposed you can build your own car and then drive it in your back yard without doing any of that.\n\nWhatever you do don't buy a car or any part of a car which is regulated though.\n\nMUH FREEDOM!
So once again. He is advocating sex with 14 year old boys and you are defending him.
Socialisation has to happen between classes through. I think richer people tend to separate themselves from poorer people both in terms of what schools they attend and within the school itself via clubs and such.\n\nAnyway this just confirms it's not what you know it's who you know that's important.
In Israel maybe.
Wake me up when you can buy a weapon you couldn't before. I'll wake you up the next time you can't buy a gun you used to be able to buy.
Children want lots of things.  That doesn't mean they should be molested. 
Who is this black boyfriend everybody keeps talking about? 
Getting news about Palestinians from Times of Israel is like getting news about Israelis from "Hamas times".
>So can I just start beating the piss out of anyone whose ideas I disagree with, and that's all clear, legally and ethically? \n\nDepends. Are you disagreeing about whether or not the last episode of taboo was worthwhile or are you disagreeing about whether or not it's OK to genocide Jews.\n\nI would say one disagreement is not like the other one.  Maybe you disagree.
So when he actually said going bankrupt is worse be didn't mean it? \n\nLet me ask you something. \n\nHow can you tell when he means what he says and when he doesn't? 
>But what do you do, then, should someone else come for all the other "objectionable" ideologies, claiming all manner of grave importance, and you've already thrown away the principle of civil disagreement for not much beyond a bit of visceral self-fulfillment?\n\nI think I see why you are struggling so hard with this.\n\nYou are an absolutist. You think that all humans must at all times adhere rigidly to any ideology they adapt and can never deviate.\n\nLet me tell you that it's not the case.  You have to freedom to evaluate each and every situation and act in ways you think are best in those situations.\n\nI hope this clears something up for you. You are not a slave to any ideology. \n\n>When you start making ghettoes and kicking people out of their houses, you're beyond the scope of this discussion.\n\nWhat about setting up a jewish registry. That doesn't harm anybody right? \n\n
Maybe you should have tilted the field towards sanders then. \n\nLooks like party didn't learn anything from this election and will continue to demonise the left and keep moving right. \n\nI predict they will keep losing. 
NASA never said it was a major discovery. Just a discovery.
So you agree we should have the same rules for guns right?
Again what makes you say that?  Where are you getting this information from?\n\n
Yes. When given a choice between two right wing candidates the voters decided to vote for the real republican vs the pretend republican.
> If the Clinton Parameters are not fair then they are probably going to have to settle for permanent occupation, or accept something they find unfair.\n\nObviously those are not the only choices. They are still hopeful they will once day get a fair deal.\n\n>As you say "they have not accepted any offers." \n\nI already explained this. You lied when you said they never made any offers and never compromised. \n\n>So the extent to which they would actually concede is up for debate. \n\nThe important thing is that you lied when you said they never did it. You never said it was up for debate. You lied and said it never happened.\n\n>Regardless, the right of return should be a non-issue. \n\nWell it is an issue whether you like it or not.\n\n>It's a bargaining chip and the fact that they take it more seriously than that is absurd by itself.\n\nThe important thing here is that you lied. \n\n>There is plenty of room to find common ground.\n\nThat's not what we are talking about here. We are talking about the preconditions that Israel will never compromise on.\n\n>Just because you have a bottom line doesn't mean that there can't be an agreement. \n\nIf israel refused to compromise they can't be an agreement.\n\n> Are you saying the Palestinians have no bottom line?\n\nI am saying you lied when you said they never compromised. \n\n>No, it stems from the agreed fact that "they have not accepted any of the offers put forward."\n\nI already explained this. There is no need to accept an unfair offer.\n\n\n>The fact remains that the only agreement they have ever signed off on is the Arab Peace Initiative. Which means they have never signed off on anything unless it gave them everything they wanted.\n\nThe Arab peace initiative did not give them everything they wanted.\n\n
>Bashing peoples heads in is protesting? \n\nWho got their head bashed in?
He keeps bringing it up.
The problem is, if some guy sells me his Haas for $100, I'm sure as fuck not selling it back to him. 
Oh, you can definitely kill somone with a 2" knife. It's just a lot harder than with a Bowie knife. Must of the damage will be 'superficial'; you might be able to server tendons and muscles (the Combatives classes I took emphasized exactly that,  but we used 3.5-4" practice knives), but even that week be hard if somone has a lot of body fat. You won't be able to readily cut or puncture vital organs. You might be able to sever the carotid,  if you get lucky.  More than anything,  a knife fight with 2" knives is going to be bloody,  but likely not fatal. 
It doesn't matter how hot the dishwasher is; the heat had no effect on the steel. The potential issues are other hard items striking the edge,  and the abrasive qualities of the detergents. Even plain high carbon steel had a critical point far, far hotter than your dishwasher will ever get. 
I wonder why body art is popularly taught as a sin, and yet it doesn't appear to affect worthiness in any way? I always thought that it was hypocritical to carve out exception for culture when those people are non-white (African, Pacific islander), but not when tattoos are become part of the cultural landscape of the west as a whole.
It's known that the witnesses never physically saw the plates. TSCC had to approve art that gets published in their name. Therfore, TSCC is knowingly posing a fake narrative through art 
Here's some food for thought - the online tests are based on self assessment. Your assessment of yourself is going to be biased; you may believe yourself to be more (or less) impaired than you actually are. My self assessment would have said that I'm moderately impaired, but my clinical assessment says that my impairment is mild (i.e., I can usually pass, but people that know me more than superficially know that I'm, um, *different*).
I'm INTJ; I'd be interested in knowing if that correlates closely.
The two times I've been to Central Park it was both winter (and cold), so it was pretty empty.
Sadly, this is true. I had a girlfriend that stuck around right until I tried to commit suicide, got hospitalized, and was out of work for a few months. While I was out of work and had no spare money to spend on her, she was a ghost. Then she dumped me shortly after I started working again.\n\nIt's all fun and games until the money is gone, and then so are the friends that were only there for the free stuff.
I'm sorry that you had to go through that bullshit also. 
Here's the problem I have: first,  religious discrimination is unconstitutional, and un-American. You wanna throw entire religions out based on a few bad actors? Fine,  let's toss out every. Single. Christian. Remember that guy that bombed abortion clinics,  or the one that killed the abortion doc, Dr. Tiller? Not Muslims. How about those people vandalizing synagogues with swastikas?  I'll bet you that they're Christians. While we're at it,  Catholics have molested a lot of kids,  so we should preemptively throw them out,  just to make sure they don't rape more kids. Oh,  and did you ever notice that pretty much everyone in prison is religious? \n\nFrankly,  I see a relatively small number of deaths from terrorism,  either domestic or foreign,  as a regrettable but necessary thing. I'd rather see a few innocent people die than for everyone to lose their civil liberties,  bit by bit. What I would say to the victims families is that our freedoms are more important than any one person. Or even everyone in the country. Once given up,  freedoms are not regained without revolution. \n\nSo,  I don't care who kills whom in the name of Allah,  yahweh, jesus,  Odin, Buddha, or any other god. Freedoms are more valuable than security. 
Well, I don't think anyone here has yet. You seem to have useful comments.
My wife gets mad at me when I start in on REM. Here, have my upvote.
Hey u/AutoModerator, thank you for the concern, and I appreciate it. I'm doing pretty well right now, really; I'm medicated,  I've got a therapist,  and I've gotten ahold of some of the really shitty things that drove my suicide attempt. At the same time,  I find the political implications of preventing suicide at all costs to be alarming; it implies that society has more of a claim to my life and existence than I do. It seems to infringe on one our most fundamental freedoms. 
Can you clarify something for me? When you say a messenger bag,  I assume you do *not* mean a bag you intend to carry on a bicycle? Because this had terrible ergonomics for that. \n\nThe surface of some of the parts looks to have been sanded to achieve a lightly sueded texture. If that's the case,  those sections are going to be somewhat weaker than full grain (but likely not in any significant way for your purposes), but they *will* stain more easily. You'll need to be careful about that. It looks like a very classy bag though. 
As bad as it is now, it used to be a *lot* worse, in the very early days of automotive travel. There used to be shit-tons of small signs (like the serial 'Burma Shave' signs, meant to be read in sequence over a number of miles), and now there are a relative few very large ones. 
In general,  I don't think people on the spectrum should work in restaurants.  Even fast food work can quickly get overwhelming,  and it gets worse the higher up you go. 
Have any of the Q15 actually claimed to have spoken face to face with Jesus? 
In fairness, the UK is also one of the few places where you have to be 18 to buy scissors, because you might stab someone with them.
Thanks,  beat me to it! Finishing an 80% lower/receiver/frame is and making it into an un-serialized gun is perfectly legal,  *as long as* you do the work yourself,  *and* never transfer the completed firearm. (For these purposes,  the lower/receiver/frame is the firearm.) \n\nI don't know if there are any states that ban 80% lowers/etc., but it's totally cool by federal law. 
It says that the AMF one is an antique though, so I don't think that it's the same machine. Still, it's a good starting point for price. Compare that to my Juki DDL-5500N, which was around $800 new.
...Sounds like it ended up working out pretty well. That sounds like the kind of dating I was comfortable with. I did terribly with the traditional romantic things. Still do. (Thankfully, my wife thinks that a Basic Pistol Safety: Lvl 1 class is a perfectly romantic activity for Valentine's Day.)
The problem is that both sites listed have a vested interest in making Muslims look bad. Given the rhetoric from the Israeli gov't, it's hard to believe that a news source that is specifically Israeli would be completely unbiased. Regarding video being 'real', it's been repeatedly demonstrated that video can,  and often is,  deceptively edited or outright falsified to spread an ideological point of view (mostly aptly by the "Center for Medical Progress" in their spurious and libelous claims that Planned Parenthood was selling fetal tissue for profit). If the video and claims were authentic,  they'd be all over news sites everywhere, and not just far, far, far right-wing sites.
Nah, don't worry about it. My bitterness is gone now.
As a a left libertarian - I'd emmigrate to Canada if I had the skillset to get sponsored for permanent residency. Canada, with the exception of the crazies in Quebec (WTF is up with the Quebecois?), is largely what I think our country *should* be. I would happily pay higher taxes to have better schools (even though I have no children, and never will), high quality healthcare for all (even though I'm very healthy and rarely need to see a doctor), and a police force that largely obeys the laws they are sworn to uphold.
Please tell me that he ended up having to pay all of the associated legal expenses due to his frivolous lawsuit...
A counselor. Saying he 'felt a heavy spirit'.\n\n...This person has no business counseling anyone. I don't know what kind of license the have,  but they shouldn't have it. 
I live in Illinois, and you have to have a Firearm Owners Identification card (FOID) to own or purchase any firearm or ammunition. Any hospitalization is reported to the Illinois State Police,  who then revoke your FOID, and instruct you to provide proof that you have given away/sold/disposed of your firearms. You can appeal (you need to be signed off as safe by your therapist/psychiatrist, and provide records from all the people that treated you), but there's no requirement for them to give your license back of you jump through their hoops. Thankfully, there looks to be a 5 year limit; of I keep my nose clean for 5 years,  then they can't withhold a license any more. \n\nEDIT: AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT,  because my wife wants to start shooting,  and I'd really,  really like to do it with her.
IIRC, there are a lot of legal hurdles to jump over, due to a highway beautification act from something like 70 years ago (originally). It's not as easy as buying a plot of land near a highway and building a sign.
The bodies on Everest very quickly become dessicated as they freeze. It's far, far too cold for bodies to become bloated from rotting.
Our house is heated by radiators.  The radiators have covers. The sphynx spend all their time on the radiators.  :/
Um,  no. That's not the way ratings work. The company that gets the scoop gets the eyes, which means they get more money from advertisers. Sure, MSNBC would spin something bad about immigrants as much as possible one way,  but Fox would spin it the other. But do you really think that Fox, well known for being just barely left of Moussolini, would refuse to cover a story about immigrants doing awful things? \n\nSeriously. Go look for independent sources, sources that don't profit from that narrative,  and see what you find. 
I think in this case I'd agree. Try being proactive; try to figure out what they enjoy as a group,  and then try making arrangements yourself. \n\nNo guarantees though; I've tried that,  and failed pretty badly. 
No, this person is completely wrong. I utterly reject the notion of priesthood authority, or the idea that any leader in the church is led by and inspired by a god. Every single one of my experiences where a leader said that god was inspiring them was just a leader talking out of their ass. The 'spiritual experiences' I've felt have been far, far stronger listening to progressive death metal than they ever have been praying or doing church things, and that's considering that I was 22-23y a very faithful member.\n\nThe doctrinal issues weren't something I even looked at until many, many years after realizing that the church and leaders were all completely full of shit.
...And you think that Trump is going to get our shit together? Really? The guy that doesn't even have a basic understanding of the Constitution, and doesn't understand that the President isn't a king with unlimited power to issue edicts? \n\nAlso: It's 'bearing', not 'baring'. You bear a burden, you bare arms.
If you want a cotton t-shirt, I don't think that you're going to find something that doesn't fade in some way; it's just the nature of the dye and fiber. I've got a collection of shirts going back to the mid 90s; the only ones that haven't faded significantly are the ones that haven't been worn much (in general, long sleeve shirts have fared better, because I wore them much less often). The loss of dye is largely a function of being washed so many times. Of the newer shirts, the ones that are holding up the best were made my American Apparel, and were printed with a discharge process. Plastisol inks (which are pretty much the standard) will, given enough time, harden, crack, and peel off bit by bit.\n\nWith an all-polyester fabric, you can print with dye sublimation. Dye sub can give you photographic results without depositing a layer of plastic inks on the top of the fabric, but both the fabric and the print will fade with exposure to UV. (Polyester will also become brittle with enough exposure to UV.) IMO, polyester doesn't usually feel as nice as cotton.
Haven't heard of them, I'll have to check it out. I listen to a lot of progressive/technical death metal now, so I'm always interested in finding new sounds and instrumentation within the overall genre.
NTs of r/Aspergers, what do you find attractive in a ferret? 
I live in a neighborhood that's 98% black (my wife, myself, and our two tenants are the only non-white people on my block) in Chicago. I like my neighbors; they're considerably more neighborly than any of the white neighborhoods that I lived in here. I know them by sight and by name. I don't care about the racial makeup of an area, as long as the people are nice to each other.
To be more specific, the gun is legally the part that has the serial number. Fire an AR-15, it's the lower receiver. For an AK, it's the receiver (because there's no upper/lower). For a 1911, it's the frame. There are a few other firearms that you buy 80% **X** for (Sigs I think? ), but I'm not sure of all of them. 
The fencing manuals he's referencing are for longswords. Kendo is also fencing.  You can fence with pikes. It's only in very recent times that fencing is assumed to mean only foil,  epee, or sabre. 
Is there a reason you can't be both simultaneously? 
Depends on the religion. I'd definitely marry someone that was into Enochian sex magick. (The 'k' means it's real, dontchaknow.)
That...  ...Seems dangerously like the view that, "You weren't there, you don't know" that TBMs sometimes toss around. I think that you *can* look at various news reports, from different sources, and arrive at a conclusion that is close enough to the truth to not matter, and I think that, when new information arises, you can also change your opinion.\n\nIt doesn't take knowledge of secret foreign arrangements to say, "Hey, maybe it's not okay to shoot rockets into a wedding party in order to kill one militant", because bad actions on the part of other people don't justify immoral actions on our side.
My wife has social anxiety and a phone phobia (literally a phobia), so I get to make the phone calls despite being the one on the spectrum. :/
Kryptonite locks (and all bike locks) are made to resist cutting with hacksaws, or breaking off with something like a huge pair of bolt cutters. There's not much of any material suitable to making a lock that can't be defeated through abrasive processes. You could make it out of a steel that's resistant to grinding (D2, for instance), but that will really only slow a determined thief down, not stop them.\n\nThe point is, a good lock is a deterrent. Most bike thieves are opporunistic; they're going to take what they can get away with quickly and easily. Anything that slows them down will make them move on to another target, because there's always another target, and another idiot that thinks that it's safe to lock just the front wheel. The caveat is that if your bike looks valuable enough, a more determined thief with the proper tools is likely to put in the time (and potential risk) to steal it. 
If you have to ask...\n\nBut seriously, I have no idea. If you can find one of their keyhole buttonhole machines for sale, it will set you back a couple thousand *used*. I suspect that this machine is over $10K, and maybe a *lot* more. 
You're thinking about Body Integrity Identity Disorder. From what I understand, people with BIID don't usually wake up on day feeling like they don't want a particular limb, so much as they've always felt that it wasn't really a part of them. (Similar things have happened with people that have gotten hand transplants, and the psychological distress has been so acute that, in at least one case, the hand was removed again.) As far as I know, the *only* "cure" is to remove the limb in question. There are also only a very few countries where it's legal to do so, and I suspect that most medical ethics boards would take a surgeon to task for removing a healthy limb.
Just a thought here - No one knows exactly how many people have a primary or secondary sexual attraction to children. We know how many people are caught for molesting kids, we have some good ideas of how many children are sexually abused, but we don't know how many people there are that are sexually attracted to children. I've hear at least one claim (...that I can't find now...) that says that *up to* 25% of men experience sexual attraction to children. (I don't know if that's specifically pre-pubescent children, or if that's including minors below the legal age of consent; there are so many taboos against sexual interest in children that it's hard to research outside of populations that have already been caught molesting children, with child pornography, etc.) My point is, if we start with the assumption (and this may be a pretty damn big assumption) that there are a lot more people with sexual interest in children than there are people that molest children, then I think we can say that these people *know* that their feelings are wrong, and understand how acting on them would injure and damage children.\n\nWith Nazis, I think that many of them haven't been exposed in any meaningful way to people that aren't like them. They haven't grown up with gay, Jewish, black, Hispanic, Muslim, etc. friends. They only see them as 'Others'. Combating the toxic ideology of fascism requires exposure to the 'other' in a non-threatening context. Violence, especially coming from the people that they hate and fear, is going to tend to solidify their beliefs.
It's been done. The machine is made by AMF Reece (best known fir buttonhole machines), and it mimics a hand stitch. You can find out more information [here](http://www.amfreece.com/d287-amf-hand-stitching-machines.html).
I can't speak to the criminality of it. What can be demonstrated is that ["Studies continue to find that spanking predicts negative behavior changes—there are no studies showing that kids improve"] (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-science-says-and-doesn-t-about-spanking/). At *best*, it's ineffective at actually changing behavior. Studies are still inconclusive about any negative effects, but the American Psychological Association [has very strong words of caution on the matter](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/04/spanking.aspx).
I've heard of Academy Duello, and I was in the SCA for about a decade. I briefly trained at Forteza in Chicago (I'm still in Chicago), and hope to return. It was tons of fun.
I'm married, and my wife has some kind of legal status in Canada (despite being a US citizen), so my understanding is that it would be fairly easy for us to emigrate. The issue that you are talking about is true in *most* countries (that is, giving preference to certain people), as is the relatives thing. I know that it's absolutely true in all of the Scandinavian countries, because I looked into it. (Iceland and Finland were my only real, viable choices, because I'm not as keen on some of the laws and policies in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.) IIRC, you had to be able to prove that you had either a certain amount of money prior to moving, or have a job lined up already that would pay a certain minimum amount. Again, this is pretty similar to the US; you usually have to have a job already promised to get a work visa, much less a green card.\n\nThere really aren't any countries that fit my personal ideals of the balance between the individual and the state, but many of the countries with more democratic socialist tendencies come closer than the US currently does.
I was accused of violating the honor code due to playing AD&D with roommates at Ricks (now BYU-I)  and got chewed out by a dean for it. I was the only one of the group that wasn't an RM, and i was the only one reported.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt might have had something to do with the Slayer t-shirt I was wearing that said 'root of all evil' on the back. 
Absolutely!  \n\n...But I don't like most of them very much. 
Hmmm. Makes me wonder if the Church of the Body Mod could have been organized a lot more effectively, given that at least one person that claimed their tattoos and/or piercings were related to religion lost their court battle over it. I think that part of the problem comes when courts start looking at practices of the 'religion' to determine which beliefs are sincerely held spiritual beliefs, and which are there as a dodge around laws that would otherwise affect members. (For instance, some native American religions can use peyote for religious ceremonies, but IIRC it's still not okay to use possess/smoke marijuana as a Rastafarian.)\n\nI think that it's something you'd want to consult a specialist attorney about.
I am absolutely an atheist. Once you reject the idea that you can learn objective truth through teh feelz, then the notion that you can know anything about a god becomes ridiculous. (Technically, I'm agnostic; I don't believe in god, because everything works perfectly well without one, but I'm open to the possibility that new evidence may surface at some point.)\n\nThing is, not all atheists are evil. Most aren't. Some are, like Stalin, Pol Pot, and Mao Zedong. But some people that profess to be Christians are also evil, like Joseph Kony, or Pablo Escobar (nominally Catholic, IIRC). Some atheists are genuinely great men, that do their best to leave the world a better place, like Bill Gates and his foundation. Most atheists are just normal people, trying to make their own way through life.
I've noticed that black metal changes from place to place. Black metal from Japan sounds *very* different from anything else I've heard (Sigh is often just *weird*), and Melechesh (one of the few middle eastern black metal bands I'm aware of) uses themes and sounds that are more familiar to that area than norther Europe. I can't say what Hawaiian black metal, written and performed by native Hawaiians, would sound like, but I'd be very interested in hearing some good examples. I'm not nearly  as familiar with Hawaiian mythology as I am with Norse mythology.
I have a strong preference for hairless pussies: Sphynx, Donskoy, Bambino,  and Peterbald. I have two Sphynx now,  two Siamese (bother are assholes), a tortie, and a Mainecoon halfbreed.
I honestly don't know. Leather is much harder to piece than fabric,  so my *guess* is that you'd need a two-step process; first piercing the leather, and then following with the needle. I'm sure it could be done,  but there may not be sufficient demand at the price it wound require.\n\nThere's a computerized sewing center that performs one of the functions of my day job,  but the price is something like 5x my annual wages. Sure,  the company could buy it,  but it's cheaper.for me to do it than a robot. ...**For now**.
I would be ever-so-happy if I could be normal. Being on the autism spectrum has made life much more difficult for me than it needed to be. If I could take his bullshit advice and magically be 'normal' I'd do it in a second. But my 'eccentricities' are a result of being wired differently, not because I cultivated being weird.
There's no trivia that's useless. I'll have you know that I completely kick ass at You Don't Know Jack. ;)\n
I don't think it's the broad picture that changes,  but the details. People on the spectrum are more likely to be more likely to be more rigid in their routines, and they are less likely to be particularly social while at work. 
I saw Marduk, with Incantation and Svart Crown opening, in Chicago. (BTW, Svart Crown was fantastic). There wasn't a hint of protest here, and I certainly didn't see anyone wearing any Nazi shit, or any obvious fascist symbolism. (Admittedly, the tattoos could have been hidden under the mandatory leather jackets.)
I would strongly suggest that, rather than trying to hide it,  you try to get help. In my state (Illinois), you lose your right to own firearms for five years after being hospitalized (either voluntary or involuntary), but it can be appealed of your therapist and other mental health providers sign off. There is no provision for removing your right to keep and best arms due to asing for help (AFAIK), unless it tails in you being involuntarily committed. Point is,  you should be able to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist and get help without losing your guns,  provided that they don't believe you to be an immediate danger to your self or others.  (Please consult a professional for the specific rules of your state.) Because I live in Illinois,  the NFA issue doesn't affect me; ownership of all NFA items is prohibited by state law, so I couldn't have them anyways. 
Have you ever seen a Chuck Close painting in person? 
I can take the basic pistol safety course with my wife,  which includes range time with shop guns. I *think* I can use someone else's gun at a range,  provided that they are present the entire time. I'm not sure how the ammunition rule works if you're reloading. (Maybe primers are restricted?) Yes,  my wife can; she has a FOID. What's probably going to happen, until I can get my FOID back,  is that my wife will get the gun she really likes so far (Chiappa Rhino; it's a pretty brilliant design), and she will also buy an inexpensive 1911 that she'll permit me to use at the range. \n\nI find it perplexing that the state has any say at all in whether I choose to end my life. That seems like quite an over-reach. 
Aside from the exposed props, it seems really dumb to do it inside. If he goosed the throttle a bit too much, he'd go into the struts on the ceiling, and then either fall into the props, or fall 20' onto a concrete floor. That said, work out the major design flaws (exposed props in particular), and this could be really neat.
While you can't get blood from a stone, you can garnish the stone's wages to pay for a court ordered judgement for the next 20 years. :P
I hadn't really thought of body art as being a sin. I knew that it was frowned on, but when I left it wasn't something that would keep you from getting a temple recommend. (Although one of my tattoos would be quite shocking were it seen in a temple.) I guess that, if body art is a sin, then I started doing that while I was still more-or-less a TBM, although it helped hasten my departure. I was still attending church (and I might have been a virgin, I'm fuzzy on my timelines) when I got a Prince Albert and a few frenum piercings.
Um. To the best of my knowledge there isn't any kind of national registry. If there is, I'm fucked for life, since I've been hospitalized for suicidal ideation/attempt. I strongly suspect that it would prevent me from ever getting and NFA firearm (machine guns, assault rifles, short barrel rifles, suppressors), but once I get my FOID back I should still be able to own handguns, rifles, shotguns, etc.
I've felt the spirit too; I felt it just last week,  when I was listening to [Ne Obliviscaris](https://youtu.be/OTiX-xAgBi8). I felt it again when I was re-listening to the music just now. I felt it more strongly than I ever did in my 22-3 years as an active,  believing member. \n\n\n...Except that Ne Obliviscaris is progressive death metal. \n\nSo,  why can I feel the Holy Spirit when I'm listening to death metal?  Because it's just an emotional response,  nothing more. You can feel exactly the same way with many,  many different experiences,  none of them any more religious than death metal. \n\nEmotions lie.\n\nIf there is a god, then god have you your brain because he/she/it intended for you to use it. So use it. Critically examine the Mormon church's truth claims in the same way you'd examine any other historical possibility. Rely on facts,  logic,  not flawed emotion. 
I can't speak to the specifics needed to mill an AR-15 lower,  but I'm *guessing* that there no tooling used that's specific to making just an AR-15 lower. Personally,  my CNC experience was back in the dark ages, when the company I worked for was transitioning to a CAD/CAM system from G-code. All of the programming I did (I did add many as 4 axes, but I wasn't terribly good) was done at the machine,  one line of code at a time. So making a program to finish an AR lower would have taken significant time and expertise. Still does, but the learning curve isn't as steep now,  since you can run simulations on you tool path to make sure it doesn't intersect with the dividing head or vise.
Ooooooohhhhhhhh, so *that's* why you can't hold the priesthood if you masturbate! 
I agree with this. A 12" forged chef knife,  even a cheap one,  will very literally last a lifetime of cutting pizza. 
[Here's a great write up on how Uwe Boll keeps earning money on terrible films](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_81/460-Uwe-Boll-and-the-German-Tax-Code). The movies he makes are terrible, so bad that most people would never admit to seeing them, and yet they are *profitable*. He even manages to land big name actors for roles. And most of the money isn't made through box office or rental revenue, but through tax credits and incentives.
A few things. Body art is a big one for me, because that's definitely one of my obsessive interests. (Given that I'm heavily pierced, tattooed, branded, implants, surgical mods, etc., it also means that they're less likely to flip their shit over my desire to get my face tattooed in New Zealand, or have my eyes tattooed.) Kindness is one of my core values. (Sarcasm and cynicism is fine, provided that people are still kind.) A strong interest and engagement in fitness activities is helpful, since I spend a lot of time at the gym.  Intelligence is very helpful, since I enjoy long discussions about politics, law, art, etc.\n\nAbsolute honesty is mandatory. I've dated a compulsive liar and scammer once, and I will never knowingly have anyone in my life like that again.
I'd love to see the owner fix the safety violations, and get this building re-zoned for the current uses. As it now stands, the building is a hazard to the people renting space.
So, why don't you? What is gained by holding your tongue?
Chuck Close was one of the artists that got the realism movement started, in the 70s IIRC. He did enormous portraits to start; faces 8' tall,  showing every single pore and flaw. Close and Lucien Freud are arguably two of the best known realist painters. Close's paintings are both amazing feats of technical mastery,  and powerful statements in their own right. \n\nAnyway,  my point is,  don't shit on realism until you've had a chance to see some of the masterworks IRL. Photos simply don't do them justice. 
Well, that's bullshit. If the state decides I need to die, I'm allowed to buy pentobarbital, but if I decide I need to die, then I can't? FFS, be consistent.
Uuuuuuuh.... You don't drag it across the pizza. You put the point down at the crust and rock the knife down. It's like the pizza rocker somone else linked to, except not a single purpose item. You could use a cheap-ass Farberware chef knife and get faster,  better results than a wheel-type pizza cutter. 
TIL. Thank you!
If by assault weapons, you mean select fire rifles (like an M-4), then yeah, the BATF may elect to not issue you a tax stamp on the basis of having been treated for depression. If you are referring to assault-style rifles (AR-15, SKS), then they're really no different from any other semi-automatic rifle, and, with a few state-level exceptions, you probably would not have a problem owning them since there's separate licensing procedure in place that I'm aware of. 
Rape wasn't covered specifically because it was already covered under property rights. The simple and ugly truth is that women were property of men: their fathers, or their husbands. Raping a woman wasn't harm to the woman, it was harm to the man that owned her. That's why there were elaborate rules covering what kind of punishment and compensation were required for which rapes.
For longswords,  it's about 1/3 of the length that's sharpened. Many of the fencing techniques assume you are fighting an unarmored opponent (and that you are also unarmored), or a lightly armored opponent. ...Because you probably would have carried you sword everywhere,  but not been armored.\n\nBTW, you'd likely use your dagger once you had performed a takedown; it would be simpler than trying to bludgeon someone through a helmet. 
Oh, this one realized it, no doubt. the list of outright lies and fabrications she told me is as long as my arm, and that's if I was using a 4pt font, single spaced. Turns out I'm not the only one she's done this to; she would date people, get as much money and stuff out of them as she could, and once they started to catch on to her bullshit, she would break up with them.\n\nI just happen to be a sucker that takes what people say at face value, and tends to believe people until proven otherwise.
Please find a similar article on a reputable news site that doesn't pull shit out of their ass. (Stormfront is also not a reliable source.)
What I meant was the Quebec separatists. I would compare them to the people living in Alabama that insist that the south will rise again. (I know,  I know,  the issue isn't simple,  and the Quebecois have some legitimate grievances,  but the militancy isn't a solution to those grievances.) The taxes and level of state support for people is not something I have a problem with at all. 
I think that you need to look at context though. Yes, NSBM is definitely a thing. But there seems, to me, to be a qualitative difference between what Marduk is singing (I'm using the term loosely) about, and what NSBM groups are singing about. Marduk doesn't seem to glorify the Nazis per se; although they definitely seem to glorify the violence, they don't appear to have any interest in who was the target of the violence.\n\nGood article to read: [Voice of our blood: National Socialist discourses in black metal](https://afaarchive.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/national-socialist-discourses-in-black-metal-2011.pdf).
Huh. I figured you bought the machines, and then just owned them outright. That's what we did with the machines in our shop,  but they're also significantly less expensive machines. The most expensive is the pattern tacker, and I'm pretty sure that was under $10K. (Programming it and getting custom plates cost a few hundred more.)\n\nIt almost sounds like they were leased...
I find that the easiest way to avoid feeling hurt by your parents doing shit like that is to largely cut them out of your life. I talk to my parents every few weeks on the phone, I visit maybe every other year. I tell them that IDGAF about what my sociopath younger brother is doing, or what kind of money they're throwing at him now. It makes it a lot easier to deal with.\n\nPersonally, I hope that they spend the very last penny of their assets seconds before they die, so that there's absolutely nothing left for my siblings to fight over. I've got a lot of great memories of my dad, a few pretty okay memories of my mom, and that's enough.
So the Holy Ghost didn't care about people on 3rd shift,  or morning crews that have to be at work by 5am?
Just major depressive disorder and alexithymia for me; nothing unique. I have anxiety/paid attacks sometimes,  but I suspect that those are what other people on the spectrum may refer to as meltdowns. According to the questions on my evaluation, I'm borderline for body dysmorphic disorder,  but all the questions are about food rather than muscle dysmorphia (an unofficial subset). 
I assume that he also wrote the program,  which means that even if someone else pushed the button,  it was his labor that made it go. 
Which one?  I took a few months of classes in Chicago before going through an ugly divorce,  and would love to get back into it. 
Sure,  I wanted it to be real. I wanted to believe that there was a god that lived me and wanted me to be happy. I wanted to believe there was some kind of purpose to life. But the universe doesn't give a shit what I *want*; the universe is cold and uncaring. \n\nIt took me a little over a year of dabbling with other belief systems - notably different forms of paganism,  with some theistic satanism for good measure (of god isn't listening,  why not Satan) - before I started to come to terms with atheism. 
Good thing the Reddit pussy brigade is just a small minority after all, which the election proved. All of your virtue signaling doesn't mean dick, America is now on the path of getting shit done. Get fucked. 
What exactly is he hostile about? Is he really so hostile or is the media's coverage of him hostile?
Dude had a cannon damn 
Please, enlighten me on what their self-interests are
But team success in a new city is heavily dependent on performance. The Raiders sucked for a long, long time, then they were good this year. Plus, they have tons of fans in LA already. I think it makes sense.
I have a feeling that all the "shitty" commercials we complain about here are probably driven by troves of data and research and work well in the big picture. There's just too much money at stake for these companies. They have access to so much information. And even if we hate them, we still talk about them which keeps the companies in that "name recognition" territory which is probably what they're after. \n\nI dunno, I don't know shit about ads and marketing. Shrug 
I fail to see how it's hate speech. Men and women are physiologically different. It's *impossible* to you that those differences, molded by evolution over millions of years and permanently encoded in our genes, could express themselves in varying cognitive abilities in modern society? ***Impossible***? \n\nThe fact that you worked and were taught by female scientists means literally nothing. Negligible sample size, plus there would be a ton of overlap in the Bell curve - millions of women who were great at scientific endeavors. \n\nBut, just to mirror your point - I've worked with females in the STEM industry, been taught by them and had them as classmates. I have never encountered these women being treated poorly or sexist, and in fact they received preferential treatment more than anything. 
Bribing the press core. Bribing. smh
yep, that's pretty much the cult of "fact checking"
Wait what? They're the next 2 highest because they've played fewer seasons...
Man, the best curry I ever had was at a hawker market in Singapore. It was just a couple bucks. God damn I wish I could go back right now and get some of that shit. The dude was serving the naan straight out of one of those cylindrical brick ovens. Hnnnng
Not really, that's just what pit apologists try to say. \n\nThat "study" (survey) is trash. None of the dogs are >50% one breed so obviously they're going to be very hard to identify. Most of them are 25% and lower. \n\nAnd besides that point - there are many many thousands of dog breeds. Pit bulls make up 3 or so and are easily identifiable when they make up a decent chunk of the genes. 
How about people take responsibility for themselves and stop eating like absolute shit? People *can* do it. It's not out of their control. We can do a much better job of teaching them and holding them to higher expectations. It works, and it's cheaper and much easier than more heavy-handed regulations.
Nice ad hominem. I'd be interested to see an actual response. But it looks like in typical Leftist zealot fashion - you're going to proclaim your outrage and flee at the sign of any serious discourse. Sad!

The owners could afford to do both.
Tom Brady - pretty good when he got playing time senior year.\n\nRodgers, Wilson, Big Ben, Eli, Peyton, Romo, Brees, Luck, Palmer, the list goes on. \n\nYou provided *one example* from decades ago. \n\nSiemian SENIOR YEAR: 58% accuracy, 7 TD, 11 INTs.\n\nAnd I like the guy as an NFL qb. I am just pointing out an indisputable fact that he was not good in college whereas almost every NFL starting qb was.
Good. I hope to hear about more firings. 
If the Panthers game was extended by like 4 minutes we would have won. They had no answer for Russ and we shut them out in the 2nd half. We were an equal team to them who had 1 bad half with no breaks going our way. 
Dude
>Realistically, no team is going to be able to get that kind of pressure that quickly.\n\nOK, the Falcons aren't unbeatable. Adjusting for era they're not even a top 25 all time offense. There has to be *something* we failed at doing or *some* way to better exploit their scheme. Just saying "they have the MVP and a good offense, durr" is a cop out. 
So completely off topic but is it a coincidence that this was the ad shown to me? http://i.imgur.com/OWnvODg.png

I wouldn't even classify FOX as "conservative." They've been a mouthpiece for moderate RINOS mostly. 
Let's all keep patting ourselves on the back reddit. This entire sub is classic /r/iamverysmart. Why the hell do I spend so much time here? This stupid ass sub is as slanted as /r/politics but with a marginally thicker veil. Mods need to work much harder to clean up this cesspool. Need AskHistorians levels of upkeep.

People managed just fine before google maps. 
My question is this - sugary foods in prehistory tended to be mostly fruit, right? Which aren't particularly calorie dense. Unless I'm missing something else? Most high-calorie sugary foods today come from processed sugar, like candy, or in combination with processed grains like donuts, cake, etc.

I think he's referring more to Leftist ideology compared with conservatism, and not Republicans vs Democrats. 
You are seriously delusional 
Why? Because historians need to keep coming up with new interpretations of old things based on the zeitgeist of their own times? 
What happened with satellite radio? 
No it's carbon which makes up a lot of the difference.
Well, but you have an offense. Seahawks apparently don't have an offense or a defense anymore.
Hmm, yes, exactly. Easy really. 
What specifically did he say that was preaching hate speech 
Right, Seahawks had 1 timeout and 3 downs. If they ran on the INT play and didn't get it, TO and they have to pass on 3rd down. \n\nThe execution and particular pass play was shite, but I have no problem throwing it there.
So, um, who in regards to this thread wants to shut down free speech?
What are you even talking about? \n\nFlynn likely said something like "We'll take care of these sanctions once we're in office." Oooh no!!! Inappropriate and he obviously needed to resign but that's not an indication of "ties to Putin" nor are the latest "leaks" which might be nothing more than aides conversing about the weather with Russian diplomats. \n\nWhere do you get "Trump is tied to Putin?" You're like CNN dude. 
Get a life man. Seriously.

"Intersectionalism" is yet *another* idea dreamed up by Social Science graduate students so they could have something to write their thesis about since they picked a field that isn't actually relevant or important and thus does not employ people who provide tangible benefits to society.\n\nIt will ultimately end up in the dustbin of history. \n\nAnd yes, it is detrimental to the Democrats. Every day their political platform heads deeper into fantasy land. 
>social science    \n\nlol. how many millions of man hours and endless reams of paper have been spent on "problems" that social science grad students had to dream up to have something to write about
Maybe because some people don't need to be connected to the internet 24/7?

Great, then give USCIS a call and ask them about hosting refugees. 1 (800) 375-5283. \n\nBut you're not going to do that, because you don't *actually* want them living in your own home. You're just virtue signaling.
Your sub is melting down right now. The ENTIRE front page is anti-Seahawks, fuck the hawks, fuck the refs, fuck everything, shit on the cunthawks, etc. Very classy.

You are absolutely wrong. All data supports pits being more dangerous than other breeds. \n\nYet for some reason people have this massive hard on for all dogs being created equal and genetics having no part in their behavior. Absolutely absurd and a pure fantasy. I think people are afraid to admit the importance of genetics because it can indicate their own natural inadequacies.

Poor coaching overall yesterday. Throwing in the towel with 50s and 3 timeouts before the half, not going for any 4th downs and instead kicking FGs as a huge underdog on the road against the best offense in the league. No clue what Carroll and company were thinking. 
>Though that's pretty much counter to the current administrations theme that acts of terror are done by radicalized immigrants, refugees, or visitors from Muslim majority countries bent on harming Americans and thus we need to prevent these outsiders from coming into our fair country to make the United States safer.\n\nWhy not, if it's low hanging fruit? The EA doesn't have to solve the entire problem of terrorism. \n\nIf *some* acts of terror are committed by radicalized immigrants, then stopping immigration seems like a no brainer at least in the short term. 
Uh, words don't matter man. Actions matter. Your "cursory" glance at history illustrates that fact quite well. I'm pretty sure the Germans tank blitzing Poland, and the Archduke getting blown away, started the two World Wars. Not mean newspaper editorials. \n\nThe only thing you're doing is fear mongering. "Anti US sentiment like we've never seen"? Can I get a source on that?
>"Women have problems with math and science".\n\nIs it *possible* that that's true, on average? And if so is it still hate speech to you? 
I was wondering the same. When the planet goes dark why can't we see the sun rotate behind the earth?

There was a post on r/worldnews a few days ago I think, claiming that the rape and violent crime "epidemic" in Sweden is fake news. \n\nWhere the fuck can I find some reliable information on this?

 I'd like to take the stance/propose that we start focusing less on human rights. Let me use climate change and ecocide as an example. Climate change and ecocide are the symptom of a very, very serious problem. \n\nThe problem is not Donald Trump, or Republicans, or rednecks driving pickups. The real problem is way, way too many people. And a global population of 11B by 2100. This planet has finite resources. It's time to start reducing the number of humans. 
Actually, I think the media being the enemy of the American people is a defensible position 
What actually happened with Bowling Green though? It sounds like Conway thought there was an actual attack, she mentioned it a few times:\n\n>“He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away.”\n\nOr are you just saying when you converse like a normal human, rather than scripted dialogue, you get things wrong sometimes?

you forgot the story.\n\nAlso, if you think Helk wants rust to stictly be PVP, then you only read what you wanted to hear.\n\nBP's were too damn easy, which is why PVP players want it back.\n\nComponents is too damn grindy which is why people don't like it.\n\nI'm currently working on a Loot table system in Java. where there's a random chance you could get more than one type of component from crates and barrels. and a random quantity of the components. The rifle/smg bodies would be find able in normal wood crates. but they would be extremely rare.

You mean this?\n\n\n>I want to make one thing absolutely clear. Rust is a PvP game. I know weapon balance is a bit fucked up, and I know raiding is very fucked up. I want a hell of a lot more raiding to be going on in rust but not until we fix a few things. Understand that the goal is not to make rust a happy place where you can build a cute base in a meadow.\n\n\nWhere He's getting at is he doesn't want the game to be "bubble wrapped",  as you put it. The game isn't meant to hold your hand. it's supposed to throw you on the beach. Bases are supposed to be raid-able. Robbing players is a norm. Scumbaggery is accepted/expected.\n\n\nAs for the xp system. no, fucking no. that was a chapter in the game I would much rather Not revisit. i would choose the BP system a thousand times before going back to that hell. as OP put it. \n\n\nBp system is loved by the PVP players because. Easy to do  straight to steady PVP.\n\nThe Component system is loved by the PVE players, because, limits the clan's resources.\n\n\nWhat I'm looking on doing is finding a medium between the two. the thing a lot of players loved about the BP system is the chance to get something they didn't expect.\n\n\nI'm  still working out the kinks, but this is a comment I wrote into my code. \n\n\n>barrels: would have a low chance of providing more than one type of component. Components are always at lowest quantity.\n\n\n>crates: Have a high chance of providing more than one component, and a low chance of providing a third type.\nEach component has a chance to be (minimum quantity <= double quantity);\n\n\n>Weapons crates: Guarantees 3 different components.\n\n\nI would be suggesting a Industrial pipe for the rocket launcher,  and make things like sheet metal use.

He described an experience with an 18-year-old camp counselor as "both wonderful and scary and kind of intimidating, and delightful."\n\n\n>**Important to note ...

Common sense:\n\n* Total length (shorter)\n* Weight (less)\n* Ergonomics (pistol grip, lots of secondary grip options)\n* Optics (way more options)\n* Capacity (higher)\n\nPretty much every American interested in home defense in this country uses an AR-15 or a shotgun, not a pistol. The AR-15 is undeniably the most flexible platform available, and it's hilarious that you think a pistol would be better.
The P30 feels better in my hand. The VP9's grip is slightly different and it feels like the bore axis is higher.
Did you get the pistol grip version or the traditional?

Videos don't accurately reproduce gun shots in the first place, or else you'd be deafened/have your eardrums ruptured--think about it.\n\nAlso, every .338 rifle cartridge I know of short of .338 Federal is a magnum, and I'll confidently say there's no fucking way they'll be "quiet" even suppressed.\n\nIf you want movie-levels of quiet, shoot subsonic .22LR out of a suppressed bolt gun.

You're mis-reading the TF2 pattern. The shotguns only shoot 9 pellets (making the 3x3 box shape). The purple dots are representing the crosshair.

>No, you can't just own a car without registering it, even on your own private property in all states.

* You don't need to "learn" how long your trunk is when you're in reverse. With a hatchback, what you see out the back window is exactly what you get. Granted, this point is mitigated if you have backup cams\n* You get more space with a hatch vs. a trunk due to the verticality. I've moved furniture in my GTI. Good luck in a sedan. Ever think that pass-through trunks were cool? In a wagon, basically the entire car is a pass-through.\n* You get a car with near-identical performance to the sedan version with the trade-off of the additional weight of a fat person.\n\nIf you own dogs, it's so convenient. They have way more room in the back with the seats down than they would in a sedan. Basically you get a ton more versatility for basically no drawback, so why *wouldn't* you get a wagon?

We call it MotoAmerica now, but yes I do follow it. been to 2 races so far, want to go to 2 more this year. It's neat - if motoGP is a sell-out stadium concert for Metallica MotoAmerica is like a local band playing at a bar. Same instruments but a totally different spectacle. \n\nfollow the series & a few of the guys on Instagram, that's how I keep in touch. Rooting for hometown hero Hayden (Roger Lee, not Nicky) and Elias this year, the L7 GSXR is looking like a top bike. Baubeier is gonna be tough to beat though. \n\nIt's a pretty low-key series compared to WSBK or even BSB. It's still finding it's footing and growing.

> He just lost all of the power in the Duc that gave him the edge.\n\nYou may not remember him from moto2 but he earned the nickname the Maniac from banzai-ing it up the inside on every corner at ridiculous speeds. Yeah when he was a kid he'd only show up ready to go to a handful of races, but those that he was 100% on board for he did brilliant.\n\nI'd go as far as saying that the Suzuki fits his riding style better than even the Ducati. He's a corner speed guy, a bit similar to Marquez even although not as extreme. \n\nI too am excited, turns out being a happy coincidence I'm a tall lanky idiot looking guy who doesn't care much for the rules and also wears Dainese/AGV and races Suzukis. \n\nSuzuki looks like they have a great package this year, even improving on the good one from last year. Exciting year to be in motogp.

> for every time the commentators mention Rossi's age in a race you have to take a shot\n\nI still haven't recovered from the collective drunkenness from the past 5 seasons...
> It kind of depends how you look at it.\n\nyeah it sure does. It sounds like you're a bit more like Marquez strategy-wise in 2015 trying to go after that Nth win ;) I personally side more with the "just get on the podium every race & go from there" school of championship campaigning, depending on how challenging your season is turning out I personally think that way is more consistent and less dangerous. \n\nEDIT: after thinking about it for a moment further - I wanted to point out that SX and AMA motocross might have a smaller gap to 2nd and so on because it is more likely you can get back into a race and earn some points after an off than it is in road racing. SX/MX crashes usually involve someone edging you out for a holeshot or corner exit, etc. or going splat when you case a landing. the time delay from coming off the racing line to getting back on it could be much less than in GP racing, where the bike goes skidding for multiple seconds, need help from marshals to restart, bike is more likely to be damaged, etc.

I however do not want the GP to be moved there.\n\n> Silverstone okay for you?\n\nYeah! Silverstone is the best GP venue IMO, even with some of the not-so-good F1 things they cater to. Huge facilities, great track with a few of every kind of corner, straight, hairpin, etc. \n\nLet's move it to ~~Brand's Hatch~~ Cadwell instead, I'd love to see Marquez & co jump the hill on GP bikes.

Here's a novel thought: why aren't they allowed to charge whatever they want for whoever they want? \n\nWhy don't airlines charge fat people double, or charge per kg? it would make more sense than per person.

> long load screens from Ride 1\n\nwhen else are you supposed to pack the next bowl??
Wat is those? 
> Is there any empirical reason why it is staggered the way it is?\n\nYes, and it used to be a different points system before like 1992-93. The points system is staggered to reward the win significantly more than to reward the podium. Also, the staggering has a secondary effect of punishing heavily someone who DNF's trying to go for a win instead of finishing second.\n\nOne's championship campaign these days must be based on a balance between race wins and podium places. 25 is better than 20, but 16 is better than none. some guys like Lorenzo, Stoner, Marquez prefer to structure their championship campaigns on just outright winning everything (as would anyone!!) but many a championship campaign has been lost because a rider crashes out going for the win.\n\nLook at Marquez in 2015, Pedrosa in 13, actually Pedrosa whenever 2007-2015 poor fella. Also one of the most interesting case studies: Valentino Rossi in 2006. He won 5 race wins, many podiums, but ultimately lost out to Hayden who had just 2 race wins but had more podiums/points. \n\nThe reason why they use the staggered points system is to stagger the diminishing marginal utility of pushing for the next position up. 
> Gotcha. Are they still racing at Daytona?\n\nMotoAmerica doesn't afaik. That's pretty far from me so i wouldn't know anything about that anyway. I know my national club amateur races there in the Nationals division, but other than that I don't think they do any other AMA stuff.\n\nElias is actually doing pretty well, consistently toward the front and on the podium. The L6 gsxr was kind to him, it was just that the new R1 in 2015 is kind of the production bike to beat :P\n\n> What are the crowds like?\n\nSmall, maybe 10k people. or less. and I'll bet a lot of those 10k are 1) invited by the team/promoter/riders/etc. ; 2) won a ticket for free in some kind of raffle or giveaway ; or 3) a local who didn't have anything else to do on Sunday. haha. It isn't anything like European racing. \n\n> Do you follow BSB too?\n\nI only know of it, I don't follow it as I don't have access to it. Kind of like y'all and MotoAmerica ;)

> I thought since GP bikes have quickshifters and slipper clutches they didn't need to use the clutch other than for launching at the start of the race?\n\nAnother point that some viewers may be missing is that Satellite tier bikes often *do not* come with seamless shift boxes. the GP15 that Petrux was running last year probably did have a seamless (but it might not have), and the GP14 the year before I'm sure did not have a seamless box. You'd still use the quickshifter to bang the upshifts but most (all?) riders prefer using the clutch to modulate engine braking during downshifts instead of purely relying on a upshift quickshifter. \n\nIn which case, he would have been using the clutch lever a lot during races.
Nah, I prefer it this way. Slipper clutches are really neat on high HP 4 cyl bikes you have to shift a lot to stay in the power band but on my V2 I'm really only ever in gears 3-6 here in the Midwest.  Even the hairpin at MidOhio and turn 5 at Road America are 2nd gear turns on this bike

> Surely such a renowned and prestigious event would be great for a series trying to get off the ground, though?\n\nDaytona's not that big a deal here. That part of the country is more famous for lynching blacks than it is motorsport and bike racing. A buddy of mine races lemons cars down there, the track is still a ton of fun, but the facilities are 20th century as fuck and the surface needs dire attention. cest la vie. \n\n> whilst \n\nhaha fuck. I'm still trying to get my girlfriend to stop saying that word, it's correct in King's English but has no place in Yankland :)\n\n> It does seem that whilst being very talented, Elias just wasn't an alien, or quite the level beneath them. \n\nI try to avoid talking down about riders since I know they are all faster than me by a mile (many miles), but Elias was not "talented" relative to the field. He had a few good runs in 06 including that race victory where he pipped Valentino at the line, but after that year he only got on the podium when his job was in jeopardy, and only once or twice more. Those rides aside he struggled to score points.  \n\n> Still, he will go down in history as a world champion and not many people can say that :)\n\nAbsolutely, Elias is a top pragmatist. He won the inaugural moto2 year on a very heavily-backed Moriwaki, bringing his 5 years of motoGP and several previous years of 250 experience up against kids graduating from 125. A win's a win, but compared to his equal peers he wasn't quite up to par. His number is #24 - he was in the same training and team that Pedrosa (#26) and Stoner (#27) were in under Alberto Puig. I forget who #25 was haha - Davies, DePuniet, or someone. \n\n> BSB seems to be of the opinion they'd rather keep prices low and crowds high, which I love because the atmosphere is mental. \n\nBSB has a winning formula; interestingly AMA Supercross and the GN's have the same formula. MotoAmerica, WSBK, etc. are trying to copy off motoGP which I believe is to their detriment. The right way to do a national championship is how you Brits do it - the racing is less important than or equal to the experience of going to the show. \n\nIs the ole Hopper still racing? He's from the same part of California I was born in. Shame to see his career go sideways after leaving Suzuki. That is probably his life's biggest regret, that and discovering whiskey. he and Vermeulen were a great team. I hope he finds success, he's such a top guy.\n\n> I'm not sure if I'm thinking of the right thing, but are the Grand Nationals a multi-event/discipline thing? \n\nMight do, GN's are the national flat track and dirt track championships here. They ride massive 750cc firebreathing dragons with no brakes. I don't follow it so I don't know much more about it than that, but I do know there are several classes and events per weekend. \n\n> The idea of Harley racing bikes is kinda amusing by the way, I know they always have but I just associate them with over-priced boring cruisers. \n\nExactly this haha. Harley Davidson is the 50 years old thrice divorced guy with a bald head and leather jacket. not exactly the pinnacle of motorsport in my head haha. \n\n> If you ever find yourself crossing the pond make sure you come during racing season.\n\nWouldn't have it any other way ;) Planning on hitting up Spain and/or Italy this year if funds allow, I speak Spanish and a little Italian and would love to pick more up. It's a bucketlist dream of mine to do hot laps on the Snaefell course. \n

> MotoAmerica didn't want a 200 mile race and Daytona didn't want to shorten it, it seems.\n\nThis doesn't surprise me one bit :p \n\n> That's good to hear, Elias career is kinda weird\n\nHis was indeed; he got hooked up with Honda right about the same time all of Puig's other protege's did, but I don't think he really had the same talent. Itwas a bad time to get hooked up with Honda - at the tail end of the "give everybody factory bikes to beat Rossi we don't even care" era. Like every other Honda, he had a great year in 2005-2006 but in 2007 he went backwards.\n\nHe did OK in the 250's whereas Stoner and Pedro were neck-and-neck for the leads more often than not. and once the 800's came to be he just didn't click with them very well. \n\n> Ahh, well tickets must be pretty cheap then?\n\nThey did a Groupon where 3 day paddock pass and meet-the-riders was like $50 for the weekend. I picked one up at that price since I had vacation time at work coinciding. It really is a great value - except the "spectacle" that is motoGP the quality of racing is just as good. I'm not the biggest fan of the cults of personality a lot of premier class riders have.\n\n> Hopefully it will grow, would be cool seeing some more Americans on the world stage\n\nI would love for it to grow as well, but history shows us that American road racers don't enjoy the same success in GP as American dirt trackers. Roberts, Spender, Lawson, Rainey, Schwantz, even Hayden are dirt track guys who happened to do sportbikes, whereas talent like Hopkins, Edwards, Spies, etc. didn't have the greatest time in GP even though they grew up on tarmac. What I'd really love to see is the Grand Nationals here stateside become less of a Harley Davidson type religion/cult and more of a "fusion" where people come & go more often. \n\n> BSB is shaping up to be even more bonkers this season\n\nBSB is gonna be nucking futs this year; hoping MotoAmerica gets some of the same magic. 
I downvoted you just cuz everyone else did. I don't even care
TastyTrade does in fact recommend some of your portfolio be long debit spreads during low IV like what we have now. I have had good success in 2017 so far with debit call spreads. \n\nthe #1 biggest reason why it's ill advised to go long on options is the time decay, Theta. If you position your debit vertical spread in such a way that the long is in the money and the short is out of the money, you can mitigate or even negate the time decay of your long position, in exchange for some of the potential profit. \n\nThe neat thing about debit spreads in non-index underlyings is that you get a boost both when you're correct directionally and/or when volatility increases, since you will be long vega.\n\nThey're relatively cheap to try out to see for yourself - the max loss is defined by what you pay for the spread. \n\n> Is it just luck since you have to time volatility and price movement to be profitable?\n\nNo, just as with short verticals your risk/reward is defined and it is possible to trade long debit spreads with a statistical edge. However, you do make significantly more profit by getting lucky. so to speak.

> I guess Daytona is better known for NASCAR, which I've never really got into. I quite like IndyCar though, watched the whole of last seasons Indy500.\n\nIndyCar is quite neat, the Indy 500 is not so far from where I live, I go more often than I don't go these days. It's a great weekend. \n\n> I had no idea whilst isn't a thing in American. People say it all the time here.\n\nLol yeah, we say "while" here, except my girlfriend who watches too much BBC television on the Netflix\n\n> You make some good points about Elias and also it makes me wonder, with the current system as it is, the goal is to progress Moto3 -> Moto2 -> MotoGP, and it feels like 2 and 3 are just stepping stones to the big time rather than world championships in their own right, in a way. As far as I understand, in the past there were lower cc specialists who made a career out of racing 250s or whatever, but its unimaginable for that to happen now really. Either way, I do love Moto2/3 and cannot wait to see how Moto2 goes with the Triumph engines in 2019! How British out of 10 am I? :D\n\nRight up until Dorna got ahold of it, that's the way it was. Well, first it used to be that racers raced in all (or many) classes during the old street racing days. As far as i know, the rules still technically allow this even if nobody does it anymore. Agostini got zillions of championships and wins that are impossible today because he raced 125cc-250cc-350cc-500cc in one weekend. Once they started using dedicated circuits as I understand it the Spanish and Italians really followed the lower classes as separate-but-equal (how American is that? :D) championships, and made celebrities out of the champions then. Only really in the 4 stroke era that guys like Biaggi, Capirossi, Rossi, and co. really made a career of winning the championship young and moving up a class. \n\n> What do you think of the new qualifying/grid position rules WSBK is trialing this season?\n\nI get the appeal but it's not for me. I'm a racer who spectates, not a racing spectator.\n\n> Hopper got two 2nd places!\n\nGood for him! \n\n> Sounds awesome, speedway is similar with 500 cc bikes, no brakes and no gears. Even though the current world champion is American, its not a popular sport stateside due to your flattrack/grand national scene I guess. \n\nYeah exactly, we do it bigger and more lowbrow over here :D\n\n> Hahaha. Went past a Harley dealership with a friend recently - he has no clue/interest about bikes so Harley was the only manufacturer he really knew and was surprised when I said they're just over priced pieces of shit. \n\nThat's even how it is here, like Harley Davidson is a bigger religion than Islam here haha. But nobody realizes...they are mind stupefyingly slow bikes unless you get the drag racer spec bikes, in which case they are even more unrideable, but for a different reason. and even domestically here they start at around $18,000 USD for one, which is about what a 5 year old Mitsubishi Evo goes for. Three guesses which I'd rather have. \n\n> Man that would be so cool. Spain and Italy are interesting countries, I would say I prefer Italy of the two but I'm sure you will have a blast in this part of the world wherever you end up going. \n\nI'ma go see all y'all Europeans soon; watch out! lol

I have a Raspberry Pi that could probably outpace a 9600Gt lol..
I was referring I guess to "at trade entry" but you're right - if your short vertical spread is ITM it will be long vega, even at trade entry. Learn something new every day.  \n\nI generally think of selling premium as a short vol strategy, although I guess it could be used to generate long vegas with ITM options. Interesting. \n\n

They were very lack on the details. The "weapon" guy wasn't there so they didn't know shit. 
yo sell me some call verticals in this bull market :) \n\n> There is no advantage to buying a debit spread during low volatility.\n\nI don't mean to be the contrarian to everything that you post, and I know that you know what you're talking about when I don't have a counterargument, but are you sure? \n\na long debit put spread would be perfect for a low volatility, bearish play on most ETF's or index funds. Since volatility expands as price goes down, the delta and vega both would contribute to profit in a long put spread. If you're not holding to expiration there's no reason not to get out at the first (or second) vol expansion as the price falls.\n\nthe same applies to long call spreads, to a lesser extent. if you're bullish on a low IV underlying the deltas of a long call spread are doing their thing (faster than vega I might add). the long vega of the long call will offset some of the directional loss if there is a volatility expansion while in the position. YMMV as is the case with all things, but i have been doing long call verts on the major equity ETF's and have been very happy with the performance. \n\n> Whatever debit spread you can buy, you can come up with an equivalent credit spread.\n\nThis sentence is a bit hard to follow to me. of course there is an equivalent credit spread - someone had to sell you the spread for your debit. unless the credit/debit is exactly 50% the width however they do not have the same risk/reward or POP. Alternatively, someone could take a short vega position with a similar PnL and POP, but it would suck up significantly more buying power on a short position than it would on a long position. \n\nIf credit spreads are good for high IV, why wouldn't the inverse also be true, all other things being equal? 
isn't this the 30 caliber clip ghost gun clown? Why don't the people of California throw him out for being an insufferable idiot?

It is an issue for sure. But really it's one of the many with the game that unfortunately that likely won't get fixed. \n\nThe last DLC seemed more of a "Ok we finished our promise and nothing more" approach and I doubt we will see any further support/updates. \n\nHopefully, BF2 will be much, much better. 
I may be biased as I'm from the south, but why the hell does it go all the way to Beddington as the "core section" and meanwhile it stops at Shepard in the South.

I seem to recall the "green line" was originally just a S.E LRT. 
They are unfortunately listed together with the EA servers in the server browser as "custom games" the easiest way to find them is probably to type something like "200%" in the name filter for servers that run 200% bullet damage. \n\nAlternatively, you can try and set your filters in the server browser to find a mode you want. It's a PITA right now as unless you set them just right you won't find any servers. The key I find is to set everything to "blank" and only turn on the ones I want like "200% bullet damage" 
You will likely have better luck at peak times. Such as on a weekend evening. Otherwise it's going to be hard. I really wish there was a proper server browser... 
That's really shitty. I wish they would get rid of half of the EA servers as the community ones are far better to play on. Especially now that there is some sort of admin control system. 
Sure, but they used it as way to get out of answering questions on other bugs/missing features. I will agree that the guys on the stream had no f****** clue what was going on however. 
Ah yes, on PC I am. It's probably the filters. They are so hard to get it working right. I find its best to reset them and type 200% in the name filter. Most of the populated 200% hardcore have it. 
Man I have been waiting for that change for since launch! Can't wait for it to go live for all. 
There are a few custom servers still running 200%. Try and filter for them, once you get it set right you will see them. However, there is only really 1 server that is constantly full thanks to the 20 person start limit. I know NWG and rtr have been trying to populate theirs but the Banzore one is usually the only one up. 
That's awesome... \n\nAlso I find it funny that the SAR mode removes all the other weapons and not just allowing the use of bolts for all classes. If they were going to do that, they should have removed pistols as well. 
Honestly  I'm not sure what the real benefit is with this change. 100 / 21 = 4.76 vs. 100 / 23 = 4.34. So, you still need 5 bullets to kill regardless (at max damage range). The real buff appears to be the damage drop off pushed further out and recoil changes. 
I find it funny that we can't go to the movies by ourselves. It's probably one of the most non social activities you can do. The entire time is spent with each other in a dark room with loud sound and not talking or really doing anything together. Sure there is the after sex smoke. Wait.. What are we talking about again? Movies are awesome. 
I agree. Especially when you see how other game Dev's do this. EA really could stop counting their money for a second and put some effort into patch delivery. Just look at how Blizzard does it FFS. 
Yes it's been an absolute disgrace how shitty the RSP program has been. Why they couldn't also allow third party server support like they had in BF3/4 is beyond me. So much frustration has been caused by this that many clans have already gave up on BF1
EDIT: \nThere we go 35 min in, Server admin Kick/Ban and ~~numerous~~few weapon changes which is about all this was good for.
> If you are discounting online dating, discounting dating older women, have high expectations about attraction, have a low encounter rate (typical in low population densities), have a low drive for social events, do not regularly exercise, spend too much time doing (a) video games (b) internet (c) television when compared to productive hobbies... \n\nHaha, that describes me perfectly well and makes sense why I am single. But on the other hand I am super satisfied with my life so it really doesn't bother me as much as people seem to think it should. \n\n
For cases with a lane that ends, there should never be "cheaters" if everyone was zipper merging. There would be no empty lane for anyone as the roadway would be used up. But, that doesn't happen due to early mergers and we get what we have now. A lot of animosity to others doing it right and a generally a slower roadway. 
Should show the comparison to what the Tsar Bomba blast radius looks like vs. the 1st one. 
20 Mins on ribbons and class rank. Yikes! Hopefully there is more to this...
You can at least try and use the filter they have or just type 200% for the name (if that's possible) I know on PC that's the easiest way. The hard part is you have to default all of your other filter options to the "blank" setting as some servers have other custom rules that might get missed otherwise. 
Why there isn't a limit to snipers yet is just silly. 
Yes.. in about a years time. 
as Americans with SIR enabled, you get the infantry version I believe. Doesn't exist in any other way except for in SIR. 
Why they consistently fail to see the benefits (financially) of large community support is just dumb business practice.  It would be in there best interest to give the community what it wants as more people would then play the game and so would their friends. \n\nIt's almost like EA is intentionally sabotaging its own game. For whatever fucking reason... 
They also have a shortage of tie clips apparently.
Some teams could build their own powered assit but most of it comes from the SpaceX pusher that accelerates the pods up to speed. 
Yeah and with ~30 min to pump down the track it's going to be a long day I guess. 
Eh to each your own thoughts I suppose. I'm not really saying that burying our heads in the sand is the way to go. Examples like this where it wasn't even at all sexist before she said it is a prime example of what I am alluding too. If we start acting like its not an issue, which it isn't 99% of the time, then we move away from blaming and using it as a defense. At least that's one way to look at it. 
That video is easily one of the best sound captures I have heard from a launch. I haven't seen one in person but I imagine this gets about as close as you could get without being there. 
The Filters are so terrible right now. You'd think setting a simple filter setting like 200% bullet damage and a region setting would get you what your after. But, it's almost impossible to find a server without setting everything exactly right. \n\nIt is even worse to try and find a non DICE hardcore server that might have a slightly different hardcore preset. For example, some servers like to keep the HUD on, but if you don't explicitly search for that you won't find it. \n\nIn order to find a say the Banzore Hardcore server (A non DICE popular server) via filters you would need to set the following and leave everything else as either blank or the default: \n\n* Minimap Spotting OFF\n* Nametags ON\n* HUD ON\n* 3D Spotting OFF\n* Friendly Fire ON\n* Kill Cam OFF\n* Regen health OFF\n* Vehicle 3P Camera OFF\n\n* Bullet Damage 200%\n* Elite Classes ON\n\nOr, you could just put in the server name if you knew it. \n\nAs for the new custom SAR mode, the DICE official servers can be filtered for by going into custom games and selecting the ... under the featured mode and listing the servers. This will present your filters to what DICE has determined to be a "new mode".  \n\n\n \n\n
Some of the teams have included on-board propulsion which could in theory get it going faster. 
Man Elon is looking pretty rough for a fairly big presentation! Casual Sunday for sure!
Honestly, even if this sounds harsh. If you can't afford proper equipment for your car then you shouldn't be driving. Without the proper gear you put you and everyone else at risk of serious injury or death. Full stop. Driving is a privilege not a right. 
You could always put the nametags back on in any custom hardcore server. Just find one or try and filter for one that has it. 
You can still find the custom rented servers with 200% Bullet damage
Thanks! So it looks like it would most like not work with the current roads we have right now. I.E, actively snowing/poor visibility with a snow packed road (no lane markings and bumpy). Oh and it's icy as hell so everyone is driving like grandma on a sunday. \n\nHonestly I am not sure how any autopilot will work in these conditions. 
I'm with you there is some serious issue with the RSP. The fact that these patch notes mention nothing about RSP AT ALL. Is either a joke or they really don't care. I hope that they will follow up with their claims and actually fix the RSP sooner than having to wait for the next major patch... 
There are actually quite a few servers, but since its such a PITA to populate them most are dead. The best way to find a proper hardcore server right now is to type in "200%" in the name filter. There are usually about 3-4 populated servers going. Hopefully, with the changes they are making to prioritize RSP servers and change the round player start limit, more clans will have servers up an running. 
I'd like the resupply time to drop a bit to ~4 seconds so that it's not spammed but useful if you do manage to sneak up to a tank. 
I'd like another limpet but it shouldn't be able to be thrown right away. Double limpet spam would be a bit much. So really, it would be better to force you to re-supply but make the time a bit lower than it currently is. I'm not sure exactly what the resupply is right now with the pouch, but if it would be about half of what it is I think it would be balanced. 
The definitely fucked up the server browser. It's too complicated for most people to get it working correctly. I think one of the problems I found is that the name filter box, doesn't work together with the filter options you set.  
What were you looking for? besides still no option for 60% health there are still 200% bullet damage servers with friendly nametags &/or HUD that you can find. They are usually drowned out by the EA 125% crap servers but they exist!
The awesome part is this is apparently what DICE thought people wanted. A uniform gaming experience in all servers. \n\nWho needs Admins on rented servers anyways?
Honestly not sure then. ~~I would guess that the pusher only goes up to about 80km/h so the rest would be up to the pod.~~ Looks like the pusher can go up to ~300km/hr but for testing this weekend it won't be going that fast. 
It's only 1 mile long and these are prototypes. I would be surprised if they went any faster honestly. 
It's because they console-ized the whole game and removed third party server support. Such a shit decision that is the pinnacle of their crusade to control all the things. This goes all the way back to when they killed off the ability to host your own server. 
I believe it's really about testing out a bunch of ideas and ways to travel down a hyperloop style track. In the safest and fastest way inside a vacuum. 
The restyled front fascia looks good, not much change but enough. But why yellow painted brakes for the new 6-piston brembo? Everything else is black and red. \n\nAlso those 19" wheels just look like slightly larger stock wheels from my car (15' STi) and that's not a good thing. I do like the seats and if they actually did reduce the road noise and rattles that would be a large plus too. I am still trying to track down the never ending rattles that seem to pop up. 
I'm on PC and they do exist. So, if you and bunch of friends feel so inclined you could start one up yourself. \n\nOr, chances are you're filters are messing with you. The UI is brutal, so if you don't get it quite right you may not find one.  
Welcome to the new world of EA run servers actually. Without third party servers and server tools we are at the mercy of EA's shit RSP program. 
I had no problem myself completing this. Took me a bit longer than expected on the first time. I missed a gun sitting near the start on the right side in the houses. Other than that, destroying the last 2 over the bridge finished it out for me. 
Risky click of the day: 1
Also, I was looking at the server browser last night at the DICE Hardcore servers and they still show up as 200% bullet damage. I thought they were going to change it to 125%???
My guess is that the DICE official servers that were running that rule set were changed to the next one (SIR). You could likely still make a custom server (or find one if it exists) with the Fog of War rules. The main problem is that there are SOOOO many DICE servers vs. Custom servers (mainly because of lack of RSP support). 
Welcome to the wonderful UI that EA has graced us with. Where competent people can't even find what they are looking for. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lRLy8GGV-E \n\nThis video has some of the best audio capture of the launch I've heard. 
Eh it's a bit a of a debate. I personally have never had any issues with my past 2 EJ engine cars. But you'll see people complain about it blowing up. The other thing is it's been the same 2.5L EJ in North America ever since the STI came here in 2004. Whereas the WRX switch to a new 2.0L direct injection FA20 in 2015. Also, the Japanese STI has never had the 2.5L motor. \n\nThere has been no formal news on when the STI may change though. 
I saw that one. I think I prefer the regular version as it feels more like actually being there watching it. 
The UI is so incredibly frustrating. It seems that most of the player base just defaults to quickmatch (even on PC) since the filters in the server browser are such shit. That means that custom server with slightly different rule sets such as SIR gets lost in the abyss. Custom servers are also drowned out by the DICE official servers (of which there are far too many) 
I got a text at about 830 this morning (about 2 hours after I had already left) saying it was today. 
Played for about an hour on the new map. \n\n* 1st of all, there are way to many tanks and planes. 4 tanks is insanity on such a small map. \n* Secondly, the map is not balanced. The French seem to always capture most of the map and push it for victory. There was some great moments of fighting the germans over the hill trench though. \n*  The new tank is really buggy right now (as to be expected I guess) as it drives like a sloppy piece of butter.  it's also fairly outclassed compared to the other tanks. The version with the pigeon is bar useless as you are a sitting duck while the whole thing goes on. \n* AA nerf doesn't have a place in this game. In fact it should be buffed. I was killed most of the time by aircraft. There just isn't any good counters to it. \n* Map should have more stationary anti tank guns to combat the vehicle spam \n*  The Behemoth tank is ridiculous strong in the right hands. Definitely takes a team effort to kill. Fairly good place right now I think. \n*  The german start on the map at D is bogged down by that ridiculous moat. Tanks get stuck in it easily. 
1 to push it.\n\nImagine being able to slowly reposition the guns!
A lot of HC players went back to BF4 because of the ridiculous changes EA made to the mode. In addition, getting people to actually find and join a custom game is frustrating due to the brutal server browser and filter. 
Which is every source of power generation we know of. A relatively small truck engine is way worse that any large scale power generation plant. Even coal. 
Cool! I guess it makes sense for slower speeds for initial tests. 
Been complaining about this since release. More people need to make noise about this to the Dev's on twitter and official forms (if they even read it)
Or you know be honest about and say something like "I wasn't involved in the patch on that aspect so I can't comment" vs. basically a lie saying "you shouldn't take the patch notes as final as there are other changes"\n\nI think I am more annoyed at the lack of professionalism on the stream more than anything. They just seemed to come across like a couple arrogant or clueless dudes that didn't know anything. Like the one guy didn't even know what Hardcore was. But they sure did know about premium and how awesome it was for you to spend money on. 
Pretty sure this is referencing the motar version of the arty truck. It would however, be awesome if we could actually indirect fire the base cannon version. I'd also go so far as to say it would be cool to actually be able to use the stationary artillery on the map. You know, because it's WW1 and all... 
Hah yeah there is that,  but the rocket sound is worth it!
Exactly, I buy his answer that he would have said to to a man or a woman. For her to play the sexist card is in itself sexist IMO. \n\nEdit: Reminds me of Morgan Freeman talking about Racism. How do we stop it? Stop talking about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMGfhXCpN2k 
Honestly, I play hardcore more for all the other aspects than the ridiculous easy mode TTK. It's all about FF, no 3d spotting and no health regen. \n\nThe way it was before, bolt action rifles were insane. You had literally zero scope sway and the bullets are basically laser beams. Meaning it was pure insanity how easy it was to kill someone across the map. Toning that down a bit with 125% has made that better at the cost of making the medic not a 2 shot kill anymore. 
It would be awesome if you could push the Field guns and wheeled mg's into different positions. Guns like this are the few that are actually useful. 
Serious question. Why do so many snipers try and quick scope. I.e, scope up and fire almost immediately? \n\nThe player here misses almost every one of the shots like that. Where if he waits a half a second longer to aim it will hit where he is aiming. I also believe in BF there is an accuracy penalty that means it won't be accurate until it fully scopes in. right? 
Yup! And no server browser either for operations... It's like they want us to be frustrated with the game or something. 
Ha, awesome and here they were touting on the stream that we shouldn't take the notes as "official" until today. Bunch of BS. 
Genuine question: What is the harm/issue in consumption of cannibals and alcohol at the same time? 
engine #249, prize #1
All of those would have been nice... Maybe someday. 
100% agree. It's really quite sad. BF1 has so much potential to be a really solid title but this RSP just killed it. They are basically re-inventing the wheel when it comes to servers. Which is bloody ridiculous. 
It also fails to mention just how the "tonne" of CO2 is measured. That in itself can be very controversial. Sure you can assign how much CO2 is released by burning a certain typical type of fuel. \n\nBut who regulates how that reporting is done? Company A can say we burnt 300MMcf of fuel last year. So that's $XXX on paper. But in BC this can also be offset by credits and the other means so really the company isn't paying the full amount. \n\nIn the end its really just another market, one that does nothing to reduce the CO2 and more to make certain companies and governments a boat load of coin. \n\n
It's part of the SIR preset. There are actually quite a few 200% hardcore servers running this option enabled which gives you the 1903 with iron sights when you are playing as the Americans. It's bloody glorious. 
You should be able to find some hand wash bays like the new top gear car wash in the North that are big enough inside to wash your car and dry it off with either the supplied drier or quickly by hand before going outside. 
So forgive me as I haven't read much on this technology, but how does a Tesla cope with snow (in general) and with icy/snow covered road roads? \n\nIf a human can barely make out where to be on the road I guess an early self driving car hasn't got a hope. 
Whooa wait is this really a thing? 
I always look at video game purchase as how much time I will get out of it for the $ spent. Typically, if I go to the movie then its going to cost me ~$20 for ~2-3 hours of entertainment. If a game gives me more than that for it's price tag then it's worth it. For me, I didn't pick BF1 up right away as it really didn't look like it would be worth the $180 CAD price tag. I instead got the game later for $15 and picked up the season pass cheap as well. \n\nTL;DR if you don't think it's worth your investment initially, then wait a while for it to go on sale. 
Take solace in the fact that we live in a country where stuff like this is caught and fixed. Rather than a contractor installing it anyways to save a buck like some other countries. 
Yeah, it's much better right now to find a custom hardcore server that has the hud and friendly name tags turned on. 
Good (i.e not bald) all seasons and driving in the city? Sure. Bald tires or highway driving in winter? not so much. 
Yup! the NWG# 5 server can barely muster up 10 people to start a 24 player, 200% hardcore rush/TDM mixed mode server anymore. It's pretty sad. 
DAE if they reduced the minimum player count required to start a server? I didn't see it in the notes, but then again they could have already changed it (my clan hasn't played in a bit) 
Sure, anything in excess would be harmful. It just seems odd that they would flat out ban alcohol and cannabis to be sold/used together at all. 
I like the idea of a small gas turbine generator and electric motor combination. The turbine can operate at a really high efficiency running on natural gas and that in turn recharges a battery pack  which supplies the electric motors. This would be the way to go for long haul applications or even garbage trucks. I have seen a few companies working with this idea. Even though it's not 100% green its orders of magnitude better if every truck used this system instead of the humongous quantities of diesel fuel currently used.  
PSA: Don't do this in hardcore or FF servers. You will die!
Yeah 2020 is the earliest that the STI MAY get a new engine after many, many years... 
FTFY bubble FTW. Only way I've ever been able to do it. 
Or you know let rent-able servers actually run operations. Then you could have a server set up however you want. 
> Please note that Uber rides from the airport will incur a $4.50 additional charge\n\nNot that bad actually.
Calexit pls
The question is what to do better next time.
 
 
The replaceable backstraps fixed it for me. I hated the way the Gen 3 felt.
People kill themselves all the time.. never seems to make the news unless there's something political to gain from it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At least we don't do it 90% of the time...
voat.co
I like trump and i still like this joke. Funny is funny.
That's because Californians are morons.
its where the people that reddit censors go. FPH, conservatives. PizzaGate, etc.\n\nIf you can ignore the nazis its a great place to get the other side of the story which is becoming very hard to find on the very censored and controlled reddit. Non-mainstream liberal opinions are getting harder and harder to find here.
The person asked for the truth about stripping not some rainbows and sunshine story of strong empowered women which is not at all what 99% of all strippers are. That's the truth. I also had an ex girlfriend who stripped for a while after we broke up. According to her, what I described is exactly the world she found herself in for the 2 weeks that she tried it before she bailed because she doesn't have the mentality to be degraded like that day after day. Most strippers are garbage. That's just a fact. There's a reason they say never to date a stripper and it's not because they have giant brains and huge amounts of integrity...
i should also point out that, since trump's deportation plans all center around illegal immigrants, its fucking SUPER RETARDED for legal immigrants to participate in this shit. No one is trying to say they dont belong here. So them going out and losing their jobs over this shit is stupid as fuck. They are doing things the right way, no one has a problem with them. If they are legal then they should have taken their stupid asses in to work because they are protesting something that isnt even about them.
Lol you think it's not accurate but it's super fucking accurate.
Bet you would have been okay if you said flip flopping loser.
Clearly got a little panicked. But didnt fire and put his gun away quickly. Honestly when a crowd of unruly trash is around you its probably tough to stay calm. The night they were burning shit in my city i wouldnt have gone outside without a gun and would have pointed it at anyone that came within 10 feet of me. These thugs get worse every day.
So you guys are down to talk about this fake news crap but not the riots happening in Sweden right now?... funny.\n\nQuestion. Have ANY of you idiots watched milo in his press conference discussing this. Kinda shuts down this moronic narrative rather quick and decisively.
Lol I'll talk about reality thank you. They are gross. Don't need stretch marks to be gross. Being 2 people's worth of person in 1 persons skin is gross all by itself.
lol im not nice. But im not a ghetto piece of trash. I dont try to destroy other people just for the fun of watching it happen. Im not a drug addict manipulating people for my next fix. I dont have a pimp who i pay with my completely legal job (thus completely removing the reason for having a pimp in the first place and basically just paying some guy for no reason). I am a realist. Not a piece of trash. To an ignorant person the two may seem like the same thing. But it is not trashy to accept reality. It is trashy to ignore it and just do whatever the fuck you want.
I dont really care about that. I know what I have experienced in my life. Women allow their emotions to rule over their actions far more than men. I have witnessed it countless times. Men of course are subject to their emotions as well. But not at the same frequency as women.
Why am I not surprised that it's black teenagers...
Lolololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololololol
It's a fair point. I should point out that at no point have I ever supported "making Mexico pay for the wall" because it's our wall and that's just childish. Also I don't actually care that much about the wall. I want the violent criminal aliens deported and I don't want the syrian refugees here. I care far more about the travel restrictions than the wall. But I still think this is a poor choice for mexico. But you may have a point here. If Mexico can put strain on enough farmers then maybe it could have an impact as you desribed.
so they beat him but stopped when he was unconscious. Fine, its just that doesnt really change anything of what i said. Everything i said still stands. They are still violent garbage and the most violent people in the country right now are the ones burning down neighborhoods and knocking people out in their demand for "tolerance" as they call it.
It's true it is an opinion issue. But most people who aren't fat are probably on my side lol.
There's all kinds of social justice feministy studies done lately that try to convince people that what they witness every day isn't true. Trying to convince us that men and women are the same. That people of different races have absolutely no differences between them. It's all SJW nonsense. Reality itself very clearly defies the results of these horse shit politically driven poorly conducted studies. I'm aware the entire mainstream world has become SJWs. Including mainstream science. That doesn't make any of that horse shit accurate.
Lol awwww. I guess you dumb cunts didn't like that response.
Good for them. We will be fine. Harming themselves further won't fix anything.
so, just went to watch the video more carefully. They are literally beating and dragging some other guy 30 feet ahead of the knocked out guy. The camera pans left to it as they stop doing it. They are beating these people. You are just grasping at straws trying to defend them because you hate to imagine that you are backing the wrong horse.
Hahahahahaha!!! They feel like they've been terminated unfairly. Okay first off you are an illegal stealing a person's  SSN. You are committing identity fraud, a felony, just by having a fucking job. Then you have the nerve to not show up to that job AND the outright gall to complain when you get fired for it.... go back to Mexico you trash.
Hahahahahahaha!!!!!!
Not a stripper but my dad has managed the girls at a club for many years. It is demeaning and you are surrounded by low class drug addiction women who are competing with you for the same money. It's aweful. And 90% of the time you end up becoming part of the drug addicted trash. A few girls manage to save 200k in about 2 years and then quit. Most don't and they become trash by spending too much time with the trash.\n\n1/10 would not recommend.
You never saw 50 people undermining obamas private talks lol. And Obama went after leakers like a hungry dog. This deep state sabotage shit is really annoying.
what, no. Obviously 90% of all people on the Internet are raging liberals and socialists. That's totally not manipulation causing that.
of course they did. Thats all they do.
How smart could he be? He's dead.
Lol. Don't use English to write your papers. Use xenglish
Lol I don't care. They are by far the most moronic state. Not by measure of education. By measure of common fucking sense. They invite illegals in to take advantage of their massive welfare system. They prioritize those illegals over maintaining critical infrastructure such as dams. And they believe the govt can fix everything. It's a state of 40 million fucking retards. Don't care if you think that just because there's a lot of them means they are smart. There's a lot of bacteria on my living room table too, they are still brainless despite their numbers... much like californians.
Lol "Hate cant be tolerated" said Antifa right before they viciously beat an unconscious man outside the Milo event. Careful how extreme you become in your intolerance of intolerance, before you know it you are the intolerant one.\n\nEDIT* Watch these videos before the asshole Anarcha-Catgirl tries to convince you that these people are not violent. She is clearly deliberately misleading people.\n\nhttps://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/2017/02/02/antifa-thug-brags-on-twitter-to-beating-man-unconscience-at-berkeley-riot/
lol nah. im an asshole and an adult. double wammie
lol prejudiced is just the SJW word for accepting the evidence provided to you by reality. I mean there are real prejudices but these days that word is misused so much its ridiculous. What i say is accurate. I dont really care how you feel about it. Most of the strippers i have met would generally agree with everything i said, not that they would appreciate the tone in which i have said it. But its still the truth.
Yeah she sounds unbelievably dumb
Stop wasting your effort on mentally ill people.
Dont listen to this chick she is full of shit. We know exactly who did it. Watch the second video on this link. It was the same group she is just trying to mislead people.\n\nhttps://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/2017/02/02/antifa-thug-brags-on-twitter-to-beating-man-unconscience-at-berkeley-riot/
An element of emotion. That doesn't mean it should be your primary form of decision making on almost all situations... yet it is for most women.
lol just because you cant accept the trashy nightmare ghetto culture that surrounds you doesnt mean its not there. Unless you are stripping at a high class joint in las vegas. Avg everyday strip clubs are filled with trash. Every really capable or attractive stripper who might actually have a brain ends up in vegas. So the experience for a stripper in vegas may be different. That also may be the case if you are a stripper in the north woods or something. But if you are stripping in a club that is near a city and isnt a high class vegas club. there is a good chance you are just a piece of trash and dont know it. Because otherwise you would recognize all the trash surrounding you.\n\nAlso my dad has been managing the girls in a club about 3 times as long as you have been a stripper. I have whitnessed plenty.
I just don't give a fuck. I don't care about being nice. I don't care if I'm wrong. There's like a real good chance I'm not. And if I am. Tough titties.
Maybe so. I do not do back breaking work myself because you are absolutely right that your brain is more profitable when you have one. But wealth redistribution really is toxic. It really does destroy the middle class and incentivise a disgusting entitlement culture which keeps the lower class stuck snuggly where it is. Today's liberal ideologies are toxic. Which is why every ghetto piece of trash in the country is a liberal. Because they are feeding off the toxic system of handouts that destroy culture and family structure and generally encourage being a lazy piece of shit.
I'm probably not quite as racist as you might think. When I see white people acting like animals I call them fucking animals. Like the slenderman girls. I hope they put those two little psychos to death. But the same goes for those 4 fucking animals that tortured that guy. I hope they stick them outside and let them fucking freeze to death in a prison yard in winter. Same goes for that white kid I hope someone shoved a coat hanger up his ass and pops his fucking organs with it. A piece of shit animalistic fucking garbage person is trash no matter what color their skin is. Those four just happened to be black so they are a pack of fucking chimps. But like I said. Chimps have more decency than those 4 did.
Check out the AMA by the swedes. Apparently they aren't all brainwashed. Many are just afraid of the repercussions of speaking out. Both legal and social repercussions.
Ummm. If that photo on the left is diversity then diversity needs to go on a diet.
really. they came across him. Gonna pretend like they werent responsible for putting him in that state go ahead. To me thats just a joke. Who the fuck else would have done it in that situation?... The fascist punching faerie?
Site Altered Title... SIGNIFICANTLY. Like very significantly Like the original title was likely complete horse shit because the new one is not even remotely the same.
which, of course, actual violence against anyone is unacceptable. But i just want to say be careful in your demand for tolerance. Because right now the most extreme and violent people in this country are those claiming to be in support of tolerance. Most of the anti-jew hate since trumps election has been proven to be faked, in an effort to rile up all of you "tolerant" people. To the point where you are beating people in the streets to prevent someone from giving a speech. You are being manipulated. Theres a REALLY good chance most of these attacks are fake, or at least most of the new ones are that go so far above the normal rate.
Well they won't turn liberal like some people are suggesting. Farmers are too busy working HARD for what they earn. If you haven't noticed a pretty big constant in liberals is that they aren't hard laborers. They aren't mechanics or farmers. That's because people who work HARD for what they have abhor the disgusting entitlement principles of liberalism. That and if liberals had their way they wouldn't even be allowed to farm half their land for environmental reasons.
The truth is, despite current trends of fat acceptance, being fat is the most lazy irresponsible thing a person can do. It is 100% entirely avoidable for every single person on the planet. Being fat shows that you are lazy, short sighted, lack self control, selfish, and a great many other traits. Being fat is in and of itself disgusting and abhorrent. Think about a person born with a truly disabled body going to the store and not finding a mobility scooter because disgusting hams have taken them all. You were born with barely functioning body and now these disgusting planets, born with perfectly functional bodies, are taking away from your needs because they choose to be fat and disgusting and unable to support their own gargantuan weight. There is nothing noble about being fat. It's not genetics. It's not attractive. It is, in every possible sense, utterly and completely mentally and physically repulsive.\n\nEdit* and that is why fat is unattractive no matter how many stretch marks the person has or does not have. Because by being fat you are wearing your lazy self entitled short sighted personality on the outside for all to see. And those of us that choose to take the necessary steps to maintain a healthy body, we see that badge of fat mentality and it is utterly repulsive.
Man, those refugees sure are enriching the culture hey?

Trump 2020
Really is getting bad
Yes... let me come in and get a vaccine every year for a virus that mutates so fast the fucking vaccine doesn't work anyway. Fuck off. Flu vaccines are retarded.
Lol these are the general results of liberals. They have been mildly hyperbolized for the sake of emphasis. But in general, farmers will never turn liberal. Look at every liberal you know. How many of them do physically challenging work? Probably none. Because people who break their body to do their work understand how toxic liberalism and wealth redistribution really are. If you used your body to earn your bread and butter you likely wouldn't support the govt redistributing your wealth either.
I'm not nice. At all. I'm realistic.
The entire concept of fracking is forcefully pumping this shit into the earth. As far as I'm concerned the entire process is one big spill. And I'm usually in support of energy projects. Like the pipelines. But franking is fucking retarded.
punishing animals with human law is fucking retarded.
well the odds are she is at one of the strip clubs that fits the pattern of my local one because it is the most common form of strip club. and honestly the odds of strippers being generally trashy is a lot higher than normal people regardless of the club they strip at. Not all stereotypes are false. In fact they are almost all based in some level of truth...
He's not advocating pedophilia you are just playing into the attempted spin they are trying to put on the coming pizza gate arrests. He is describing his own life. He is pretty clear on his official stance on pedophiles.
but they dont actually differ that much. Sure left wants economic control and right wants social control and wars. But if you keep jumping back and forth between the two the actual result is more control on all sides, because neither of them repeals the govt overreach of the guy before them. They just start adding more overreach in the category that their side approves of. In the end i believe they are all on the same team. The team that wants to see our rights destroyed.
Except so far all the trump driven hatred has been faked by liberals. The church burning the swastikas. All done by liberals to make it LOOK like nazis are taking over. Something tells me the same goes for 90% of these situations.
i sure do hope his first act as President is to investigate the [rampant voter fraud & rigged voting machines](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/trump-twitter-election-already-rigged) that won him the position.
That's reality. My dad isn't the cause of the nightmare that strippers live through. Just whitness to it. He does his best to stop them from doing drugs and stop them from having pimps (yes snippers are dumb enough to give their stripping money to pimps). But they are ignorant ghetto trash and they regularly self destruct or destroy each other despite his best efforts to get them to act like not garbage. Not every woman having a hard time in life is having a hard time because a man is making it hard. Some are their own worst enemy. Like most strippers. Hmm. And most feminists actually. Lol.
Welcome to the trump train. Wooooo.
Lol don't really care what you think. They were chimps. That little white boy was a fucking animal too. But after watching those 4 CHIMPS can you really tell me they weren't a pack of fucking animals? Because they were. Fuck actual chimps have more decency than what they did.
Lol laugh it up. Gonna be real funny right up unil you or your wife is the one being raped.
And you think I want the Syrians here? You think muslim culture has any place in our culture?
Yeah... this seems dumb. Lol.
2 out of 4 are DEFINITELY FAT. The two on the right are both gross. The far left on is actually in shape and the second left one is just kind of average but not at all fat.
oh right. so they beat a guy unconscious in an effort to prevent someone from speaking. But its cool cuz they stopped once he was knocked out. Except that one jackass who they yelled at. That makes it cool. No worries then. As long as you only beat your ideological opponent to the point of unconsciousness and not too much after that then its not REAL violence. I mean these are fascists we are talking about here RIGHT?
Gonna reply to your comment higher up so that you wont be able to mislead as many people. Here is a link to 2 videos of them knocking the guy out and beating others. This should put an end to your "maybe it wasnt them" horse shit narrative.\n\nhttps://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/2017/02/02/antifa-thug-brags-on-twitter-to-beating-man-unconscience-at-berkeley-riot/\n\nfucking shill. Im not your friend you misleading asshole.
dont bother with the harder diet first. Just change your lifestyle. If you do the diet and then fall back to your new lifestyle you will end up at the same equilibrium you would have if you just switched to the long term lifestyle without the unpleasant diet beforehand. Unless losing the weight fast is important to you.
Wish some rational white people thinking would colonize this dumb cunts brain.
yeah thats my big thing too. I just dont want to fuck up peoples rights at all. Which is why i want less govt all around. Because govt basically fucks people rights up for a living. I definitely wouldnt call myself conservative or liberal. Because both sides look to the govt to solve all their problems and i definitely dont.
well thats just a given. When 2 of the 4 of those chimps that tortured that guy in chicago were female i was stunned. Women typically think with their emotions, which is normally annoying. But it does prevent them from doing most of the terrible shit that men will do.
Being indoctrinated into a cult by the minute is life changing* FTFY
Are the nazis attacking your car? If so then run them over. Are the protesters calmly standing and protesting. Then don't run them over. It's not a contradiction you people are just idiots that don't understand the difference between a protest and a riot.
lol my point is that they are violently beating people they disagree with. I already accepted that they werent being him after he was unconscious. you just keep trying to make me look wrong because you are an actual shill. Its really interesting talking to one. You are pretty talented. I think i have run into one before as well. So good at arguing in circles without saying anything real. You are supporting violent thugs whose LEADERS go on twitter to brag about beating people. You are the fascist. Go fuck yourself shill.
Lolololol so sad how gullible and unintelligent so many people are.
That made me sad
I honestly get a little tired of being right every time I end up thinking that and then they prove me right. Like I wish they would stop living up to their stereotypes because it would be a lot fucking easier to not be racist that way.
Lol. An anecdotal experience... yes all the interactions of my life are a single anecdotal experience... I won't ignore reality just because in the last 10 to 20 years everyone else has decided to start doing so.
Lol well if they are legal then they are protesting in defense of the people I described and again, I don't give a flying fuck. They can STILL go back to mexico.
That almost made sense. For a moment. Then it didnt. And she's still retarded.
You know you could mute it and still get the images you need right?
so you don't think the U.S. is the greatest country in the world, & that it deserves to be led by someone with no experience in political leadership. cool story, bro.  
Here. Watch these two videos. Pay attention in the second video to the fact that one moment there is no man lying on the ground and the next moment there is one. And then SHUT THE FUCK UP because you are VERY obviously wrong. Who needs to get more facts now asshole.\n\nhttps://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/2017/02/02/antifa-thug-brags-on-twitter-to-beating-man-unconscience-at-berkeley-riot/\n\nStop defending these people. They are violently beating people in the streets and bragging about it. Grow the fuck up.
How the fuck does he do this. What kind of fucking ninja is he that he has people in all these places. God this is so much fun to watch. Like a year long movie in real life.
The point is not who is in what condition, but what a bunch of Muslim migrants will do to any country regardless of its condition. They will make it worse. Trump wasn't saying we are better than Sweden and neither are most of us. We are simply saying don't make the same mistake Sweden did or it will do the same thing it did to sweden. Damage our country.
They seemed pretty vicious honestly. All four of them strike me as borderline sociopathic in the way they could do that to another person. I wouldn't be surprised if those two women specifically would have tortured him alone. But it never would have gotten to that point without the men there to beat and subdue him.
Showed this to a friend recently to demonstrate the power of T_D. Did it with like 5 different phrases that we have now manipulated successfully on google images. So much fun.
So... really we are gonna call these people hackers. What a joke.
Wow... I hope they are imprisoned for a very very long time.
i dont care if you think my statements are prejudice. They are reality. I didnt say all strip clubs. I even pointed out that there are likely strip clubs that have a different pattern. But there is also the avg city strip club which does fit the pattern. using your experiences to assess and build patterns is not prejudice it is literally how our brains function.
ask that same question to the huffpost and they will confidently reply "the ministry of truth you white cisnazi bastard!!!"
Oh I'm certainly not sorry to see them go. Just wish they would use a method of suicide that is less inconvenient to the rest of us.

Are you saying he should have been scared of a bunch of old people? 
First thing that popped into my head as well. 
how is "giving voters a slightly larger range of viable candidates" even *close*, in your mind, to "removing opposition"?  \n\nbelieve it or not, a significant group of US voters do see the Democrats as "centrist" & the Republicans as "conservative," leaving no actual "leftists" in any sort of position to actually be elected.  \n\ngranted, that's equally the fault of our current third parties for a general inability to strategise for themselves.... but it'd still be nice if we were a little closer to the 3-party system in Canada (which is notably not a "communist" country).
well, i sure do hope one of Mr Trump's first priorities is to address that particular "issue," since he apparently managed to win a rigged election anyway.  let's see if he does!
i was having a bad day already, & suddenly the universe got more boring.  WHATEVER i'm going to go look at some fake space photos now.

hopefully at least around half of us will be waking-up to the idea that they won't magically become bootstrapped millionaires -- in fact, will probably be in the exact same place they are now -- but now living in a country slowly being decimated by massive cuts to [funding for things like education, arts, transportation infrastructure, & perhaps even state commerce/security matters](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts).\n\nunfortunately, most of that demographic will respond by pointing their fingers at other social groups while still firmly towing the "NO TO TAXES" line.  
> I don't care if you don't believe me Mr. Internet Stranger! \n\nyour post history says otherwise.  what will your last word be, this time?  how does someone so successful have so much time to laud his own accomplishments on reddit?  
yes, & i've also taken chances on 1-2 star things that i ended up really enjoying.  their predictive system, even as it is, seems like it would merit improvement.
to be fair, a couple weeks back i left my apartment to help a huge 18-wheel truck make a difficult turn.  it involved asking motorists in the opposite lane to move back (& helping direct them do so).  one woman responded by getting incredibly angry & threatening to "shoot [my] ass" ......because i had the audacity to tell her to put her car in reverse.  \n\nsometimes that's the reward you get for trying to help.

i now have to make the embarrassing admission that, the year i became obsessed w/ Elliott, i spent his 'deathaversary' in the local park drinking orange creme (i think?) MD from a paper bag.  wrote a poem on the bag & left it under a bench.  \n\ni had actually *asked* at the liquor store if they had kiwi.  i got an extremely judgmental "no" in response.  
i'm definitely a dude, but i'd wear a dress if it got me up there. :)
i assume that you're serious, & that's fine.  i will definitely leave this comment up, in order to reply to you when your own party impeaches president Trump.  i will be curious to hear what you say at that point.  
> no matter who "won" this one. \n\nso, what does "won" mean in your context, then?  the winning candidate of this past election [repeatedly stated prior to his victory](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/17/13304574/donald-trump-twitter-tirade-rigged-election) that voting was going to be rigged & the outcome fraudulent.  do the quotation marks around "won" mean that you question the outcome, or not?
you're not worth the effort it would take to respond, in part because you're talking out of an indefensible position & you know it as well as i do.  that's what amuses me the most about Trump supporters.  none of you *actually* take him seriously.  it's Republican contrarianism taken to a ridiculous (& frankly obnoxious) extreme.  
no, but stopping the idolization of Paterno, who knew about the abuse for [30+ years](http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/05/court_filing_says_joe_paterno.html) might help a little....   \n\njust a suggestion from someone who lived there for a couple decades.  don't mind me.

i'd prefer to see it melted-down into a giant poop emoji.  which is what it deserves.\n\n[NOT EVEN EDITED TO ADD: lived there for 18 years, went to school there for 1.  fuck you, PSU.  you covered up 30+ years of child molestation & now your student body acts like every year of THON "makes up" for that.]
hmmm?  don't *you* give your motherboard a good hose-down from time to time?
awesome, thanks again!  William Fitzsimmons is one i'm looking forward to, as well as the Sun Kil Moon (tentatively).  \n\nYuck has several albums on Spotify, if you have it.  that'll be my listen this morning.  :)
i would give anything to live in rural Nova Scotia, if only i could get Canadian citizenship to be able to work there.  
Almost all of the most famous artists of the past 30 years have no college degree or dropped out. Jean-Michel Basquiat is a classic example that comes to mind, the dude just started painting one day and got really good at it.  \n  \nSeriously, name a few famous artists who became what they were because of their alma mater. Dream Theater is the only group of artists I can think of, and that really only happened because their school brought them together.   \n  \n \n\n
i feel like these are too common, but that's probably because most of what i listen to is sad songs...  in no particular order: \n\n- Neil Young - [Ambulance Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4zAZuB6jBk)\n\n- The Mountain Goats - [Old College Try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnLol5gJWj4)\n\n- OP8 - [It's a Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8ov7W9zZ4Q)\n\n- Michael Penn - [Long Way Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSPDTJJchw0)\n\n- Iron & Wine - [Jezebel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=990kOZxIOKw)\n\n- Azure Ray - [Just a Faint Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fE47xOjAlE)\n\nall the associated albums are great listens, as a whole.
i'm more worried that the sub actually exists, & is set to 'private.'
for that matter, why isn't election day?  so that everyone can have a chance to participate in that democracy.
how many of your guns have been taken by the Democrats during the 30 years you've been voting?  \n\nyou *seriously* vote for a party that you believe "feeds you BS" because of a hypothetical situation that has no historical precedent?\n\ni mean, come on now.
just to belabor the point, let's all remember that [the NRA has consistently fought against any kind of legislation to make trigger locks or gun safes mandatory](https://www.nraila.org/articles/19990729/mandatory-storagetrigger-lock-legislat).  because that's what they do.
k.
aw, we feel so bad for you.  over 30 children have to live the *rest of their entire lives* having been raped by a creep, but as PSU students **you guys** are the real victims. \n\nfuck off.
sure, it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nin addition, there's the sad fact that their non-original content library is steadily going to shit.  i say that as someone who *does* like the original stuff, but man... selection is so far from what it used to be.
this is the "green world" of literature. Garden of Eden, etc. 
wow, that's a whole lot of vitriol you've got going there, man.  yikes.\n\ni have yet to hear a single gun activist explain to me how they're going to actually go about overthrowing the US government.  unless you've got an approximately $600 billion weapons stash laying around, how exactly do you think your AR-15 is protecting you?  do you think 1000 people with AR-15s would win?  what's the scenario in which "*actual* government tyranny" is something about which you can do exactly jack shit?  serious question.\n\n& my space it plenty safe, thanks!  it always has been, & i've never seemed to need a firearm to keep it that way.  funny how that works.
are the other covers published anywhere yet?
i mean... i grew up in rural Pennsylvania, now live in Pittsburgh, & would *love* to live in NS after having dated a girl from Lunenburg & spent time there.  maybe it's not the best place to start out, but if i had a way to get Canadian citizenship i'd be in Halifax in a heartbeat.  yeah, it's a depressed area economically.  but it's also beautiful, generally friendly, & seems like a reprieve compared to the places i've lived in the US.  \n\njust offering an outsider perspective.  
when i had the DVD service, i'd manage that by immediately ripping the discs & sending them back the next day.  i could average 3 discs a week or so doing that, & built up a queue of stuff i could watch whenever i wanted.
this is prettymuch me when i'm drunk.  my cat is remarkably tolerant. 
... did you think this was funny or clever, when you posted it?  if so, why?  
not just "Big Pharma," unfortunately.  [hemp](http://www.hempbasics.com/shop/hemp-information) can also be used to make a *broad* range of products, particularly those that currently are in the plastics industry.  there are multiple giant corporations who have a vested interest in cannabis being illegal.  \n\ni don't even care about the weed aspect, although i do smoke.  the actual use-value of hemp is an absurd thing to ignore, especially for puritanical reasons.  
but you might want to add that pinch of salt to the sugar first, for its anti-caking properties!
if you take off his shoes, you'll see the dicks growing off his feet!
so you'd literally hand an increasingly militarized police force the legal right to murder you, on sight, because of a hypothetical situation?  \n\nthis is the epitome of an "if you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide" attitude.  i find it very frightening that people feel this way.
there's this huge, flaming orb in the sky on a daily basis... but we're like not supposed to ever look directly at it.  \n\n[hits bong]
good point.  & one which could also potentially put a burden on parents to have to take off work for childcare purposes.  \n\nthis seems like it would be such an easy / small issue to change...
Australia's homicide rate actually went up after confiscating all the guns. 
Yes, the gun is squared away with the correct choke for turkey. This was a massive effort because I live in MA, lol.   \n  \nStill to get: Camo clothing, netting for ground blind, call, decoy. If possible, I'd like to get everything else on the list for 200$ or less. 
i was pretty young, but i definitely enjoyed watching her.  we had a fish-tank repurposed as a terrarium.  the most significant memory i have is that, for a few days, she started turning pale/white... we figured she was dying, & that was going to be that.  \n\nturns out, millipedes shed their skin kinda like snakes.  so i got a millipede-husk, & she was healthy as ever.  (this was before the internet existed, so we couldn't exactly look it up) ... when she escaped, i was pretty sure she was still chilling in the basement of our old house.  we moved shortly after that, though, so i can only hope i left a creepy gift for the new owners.  
that PETA apparently [supports this](http://www.peta.org/living/companion-animals/vegetarian-cats-dogs/) is one of the biggest arguments against them.  cats need meat primarily, & to deny them that is the opposite of 'ethical.'
tigers are known for being very eco-conscious.  he probably couldn't afford a Prius, so he picked out a scooter because it's very fuel efficient.
so had the child abuse.  [source](http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/05/court_filing_says_joe_paterno.html)\n\nwhich doesn't relate the two items, but still invalidates your assertion.  also, for what it's worth, PSU & the Second Mile (the charity that specifically helped to enable Sandusky raping children) were completely in collusion.  many Second Mile "events" involved PSU games & facilities.
France has pretty restrictive gun laws and they've had several in the last few years. Meanwhile, Switzerland has massive assault weapons out the wazoo and has an extremely low rate of gun violence.  \n  \nHmmmmmmm.......
Speak for yourself. 
Broken, meaning we don't just let whoever wants to come here in permanently? Last I checked, H1B workers in high demand fields like programming don't have any trouble making it over here. \n  \nSpeaking of which, you guys really need to get your head straight about UBI/Automation and immigration. Either we need Mexican slave labor to pick strawberries OR all manual labor jobs will be automated within 20 years. Pick one, you can't have it both ways. 
The difference between then and now is we will very shortly no longer have the need for cheap manual labor. You may remember that the Irish and the Chinese were needed to build railroads and serve as cannon fodder during the Civil War.  \n  \nThis is the fundamental flaw with your entire argument. Large amounts of immigration was beneficial in the past because there was a role for it: factories needed manning. That America is gone, dude. The shortage jobs are almost all high skill and high tech and any job you *think* you need a Mexican slave to do will be gone in 20 years.   \n  \nThe whole narrative that they do jobs we don't want to do is totally false anyways. A huge amount of the jobs being taken are restaurant and construction jobs which white people are more than willing to do. 
> the idea of a virginal woman having some greater value than a sexually active woman isn't empowering, either.\n\nYou might actually be wrong about this. Every study done on the subject shows that marriage stability is inversely correlated with the number of premarital sex partners. This could be for some other reason, or they could be directly linked: vasopressin and oxytocin are real, and their effects on the human body are profound. We don't know, but the two are definitely linked.    \n  \nIf a long, stable marriage with the right person is what you value in life then you might start placing a lot more emphasis on maintaining your virginity until the right person comes along. 
The government, of course. Silly!
"Something that was good for us at a time when we needed a lot of cheap manual labor will be good for us forever, especially at a time when a lot of low-skill jobs are being automated".  \n  \nLiberals really need to figure out which one they like better, UBI/Automation or open-border immigration. 
Massachusetts, so it could be anywhere between 30 and 60 degrees on the first day of the season. For clothing, I was planning on just getting some surplus at a local Army/Navy store and layering up underneath it.  \n  \nHow many and which type of decoys should I get? Obviously for budget a single hen would be best but I'm getting mixed messages from a lot of different sites.  
\\>Implying the forecast and the shoveling deadline were linked in this particular instance  \n  \nwtf i love unjustified tickets now
Ok, let's not pretend that supporting BLM is exactly an unpopular proposition in the Massachusetts Bay area. Being against BLM would do him way more harm than good. 
Thanks for giving it some serious consideration although I knew that I was going to get a lot of that when I made the post in the first place. From my experience with a total bullshit "Snow Emergency" last year, I actually think in a tinfoil hat kind of way that they do this to place people in a situation where they will face fines. Lord knows they have an incentive because they make a lot of money that way.   \n  \n The fact that they gave up so easily when I contested the ticket says that they knew it was bullshit in the first place and were just hoping that I wouldn't say anything and just fork over the money.   
http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html  \n  \nGun grab happened in '96. It went up from '96 to '97, decreased slightly in '98, and then there was a significant spike in '99. There seems to be an overall decrease between '03 and '07 but you can see that at least in the immediate time being removing firearms from the streets had little/no effect.  
It's almost like availability of guns has little or nothing to do with whether mass shootings occur in a society.    \n  \nGlad we could come to an agreement. 
It's incredibly disingenuous of you to complain about how the US didn't just fling their doors open to you because you wanted to come here. If I threw a tantrum because I tried to move to Japan and was rejected, everyone would just laugh and say "fuck off, they don't owe you anything".  \n  \nThe US is one of the most immigrated to countries in the world. It's a no-brainer that the waiting list is going to be that long, we only want the best and the brightest. 
I'm currently in dental school and see this trait in my classmates all around me. We're going heavily into debt for our degrees but all I see anyone doing is buying 900$ Canada Goose jackets, spending tons of money on going out to bars, and thousands per month on luxury apartments in very expensive areas of the city. They live this lifestyle making negative income right now and there's no reason to think that they will stop or dial it back once they actually have to start paying back the debt.   \n  \nAs a side note, I shop at thrift stores and always make my own food but a lot of people (not all, but more than enough) at school seem to regard me with scorn for this. I feel like I'm in high school again with a bunch of 26 years olds. The snotty rich kids making fun of poor kid with hand me down clothes, it's a very surreal experience. 
muh slave labor
> "A legal immigrant had something racist happen to him so let's open the border"\n\n
"I can just take money from residents whenever I want regardless of their work schedule because it snowed, a common occurrence in New England"  \n  \nLet me guess, you have someone else shovel your walk for you? I'm not particularly interested in the opinion of the good citizens of Somerville on this, it was intended to be a PSA for people who got dinged by the city fucking with the snow emergency system to generate revenue.  \n  \nThey did it to me last year by fining me for parking my car on the even side when less than half an inch of snow fell and the plows were never even called out. It was bullshit then, and it's bullshit now. As someone above said, the snow was originally forecasted to continue on into the afternoon and giving people 5 hours of notice *after* everyone has already left for work is clearly a blatant cash grab.  \n  \nIf they sent the notification out the night before? I'd have no problem. This was either laziness or maliciousness on the part of the city. 
I know many high schoolers who worked at McDonalds from 2004-2008 but then again that was in a state that is 95+% white people. I'd imagine it works a lot differently in Southern California.

There are way too many people that think UBI won't result in a massive number (possibly a majority) of people like this, essentially becoming a conduit for turning food into shit. 
Can't I just hand tighten it? How tightly does it really need to be on there? 
You know all the Harry potter shit is really embarrassing for the anti-Trump people, right? It's really cringey and sad, basically confirms what people have been saying this whole time about liberals being children in adult's bodies. 
http://i.imgur.com/DnMjpl3.jpg  \n  \nhttp://www.livescience.com/55104-sex-partners-and-divorce.html  \n  \nhttp://www.economist.com/node/17956905?story_id=17956905  \n  \nThere's a lot of info to be had, but there's a clear direct relationship between number of premarital marriage partners and marriage stability. (Just google "virginity marriage statistics" or similar)\n  \nThe relationship definitely is a mystery: I saw one that suggested it might even be genetic, they found an allele of the vasopressin receptor gene that was highly correlated with a large number of sexual partners and a high rate of marriage failure. It could also be that childhood experiences cause people to seek a large number of sexual partners and those same experiences cause them to be a poor spouse later on.  \n  \nWhatever the cause, having one's virginity intact *does* say something about you and if long term marital stability is a goal then one would be totally vindicated in filtering for partners who have it. 
It's not really relevant if it's a symptom or the cause of the symptoms, we're not doctors trying to "cure" it. It's a sign that says something about a person, and you can use that when choosing a partner depending on what you want out of the relationship.    \n  \nYou can argue yourself in circles about whether alcoholism causes abusive behavior or if they both stem from some third defect but it's always a safe bet that if you want to avoid abusive behavior you should stay away from people with alcoholism. "B-b-b-but correlation doesn't imply causation!!" Thank you, I'm well aware.  \n  \nI can't say anything about whether marriage is a goal for many people or not but those who DO want to get married (I'd be willing to bet this is still the majority) [fully expect their marriages to last a lifetime](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/17/marriage-expectations_n_1784371.html). 
So you just used 2 hen decoys with no jakes? I'm just taking a survey of the people in this thread so I have lots of options to consider. 
I left my house this morning before all of those people had even started shoveling. Must be nice to get to sleep in. 
*Cringe*  \n  \nIf only you read my fictional children's book, you'd know what happens!!  \n  \nSomeone please remind manchildren that Harry Potter isn't technically real. 
The rest of the latino world isn't the biggest fan of Mexico. Mexico actually has some problematic relations with its southern neighbors because Nicaragua keeps letting illegal immigrants of their own cross into Mexico and cause problems.  \n  \nOn a side note, Mexico's border security in the south is top notch. 
Good idea.
> should have\n\nBut they didn't. The state allowing someone else to be violent on their behalf in suppression of free speech isn't any better than perpetrating the violence themselves. 
Maybe you should work on making your own country a nice place to live then?
I know we all love this because it's against anti-vaxxers (booooooo!!!) but if we ever end up with a UBI system what's to stop the government from doing the same thing to anyone else that they feel is in the wrong? 
[What the fuck do you call this?](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/01/uc-berkeley-campus-protest-milo-yiannopoulos-breitbart/97378104/)
You didn't address the question. Do we need illegal immigrants because they do jobs no one else wants to do or are those jobs all in danger of being automated?  \n  \n
When did I say I was trying to get out of shoveling? \n  \nThis is what tells me you have poor reading comprehension. My gripe is clearly with the scheduling the city picked out, not with shoveling in general.  \n  \nAlso, it was really mean of you to take away that internet point of mine, please give it back thanks.
Your original comment was nothing but a complaint that getting into the US wasn't easy enough for you. 
Which is it, should I quit bitching and suck it up or should I hire a lawyer and drag him to court?  \n  \nI know you didn't think very much about this before reacting so emotionally to the initial post so I want to make sure you've got your story straight. 
Does this explain why they're using the snow emergency system today to pull off a massive cash grab from the citizens? 
"A legal immigrant had something racist happen to him so let's open the border"\n  \nThis is how stupid you sound. FYI, they're probably right about the "learn english" part because not knowing the predominant language is probably a prerequisite to immigrate legally. I'd imagine that a large number of the "immigrants" in the US who only speak Spanish came here illegally. 
Who said I didn't walk to work? My car is still covered in snow because I only use it on the weekends.    \n  \nOh, and good for you, mr. neighborly. I was too busy doing meth and browsing /r/the_donald to be a good citizen like you. I hope the mayor gives you a medal.  
Are they good quality? Have you had any luck with using these?  \n  \nReal newbie question here: What does the presence of the single jake do? Do other jakes run over thinking they can fight him and take his ladies? 
You should look up the homicide rate broken down by different racial groups in the US. 
> We need to allow more immigrants because they make up the fabric of our society. What kind of country would we have if we had such restrictive immigration policies when most of the European immigrants came here at the turn of the century?  \n  \nWhat the hell kind of non-answer is this? This is a purely emotional response with no substance whatsoever.  \n  \n  I do agree with your point about automation being a much more serious issue than immigration precisely because the people who are all in favor of immigration to keep the price of labor low are the ones who will be implementing the automation. What happens to the millions of low/no-skill illegal immigrants when someone finds a cost effective way to automate citrus picking?  \n\n
I'd put money on this being the answer. 
>One can support immigrants while still being opposed to illegals.  \n\nYou say that, but a lot of comments ITT seem to say that a lot of people think otherwise
> Is there at least one woman named as an "Officer" or "Director"? I believe strongly that women make companies smarter and more ethical.\n  \n  \nTell that to Yahoo
I don't own a house. I just live in one and since the landlord lives in TN, I have to be the one to shovel. Any more retarded quips you wanna throw at me? 
I was awake at 5 this morning so I could leave by 615. Must be nice having a cozy 9-5 office job :( 
What type of hen decoy? Some of them have their heads up which I've heard is bad because it makes the tom think there is something dangerous around.  
What do you think about the old-school army BDU camo? I only ask because I have a huge Army Navy store right next to me and I'd prefer to shop there rather than taking a chance with something online.  
As long as pricks like you keep getting this offended by it, no.  
Can someone please explain to me how this got turned into "Donald Trump makes up fake terror attack in Sweden"?
You are absolutely right. I want to ad I love America been there twice and know some people there. But the government are nothing but a bunch of crooks. The president is nothing more then a puppet that is chosen by the real government. Although things are changing the American machine behind it didn't change it only became more fierce and shameless with a narcissist like Trump in  office.
Sorry for my late response to somebody. I tried to message and reply directly but after three times I give up. Baconit Reddit is so buggy it's ridiculous. App closes in itself while typing a big storyline, messages disappearing etc. I am through with this shit. Also people on here (ofcourse not everybody) is just rude or angry. Useless bickering and fighting over nothing but words and statements. And it has gotten progressively worse. If I read some of these messages or replies I am really thinking to myself 'why are you here?'. I am really trying my best to stop all commenting as much as possible maybe even all together, it just isn't fun anymore. All these angry ignorant and probably frustrated teenagers trying to vent their hopelessness or loneliness on someone else. The web has become a sort of echo chamber to just shout out 'this is me'. Especially this younger generation from gen Y and up seem to have this weird affliction of arrogance from ignorance, it's hardly tolerable. I am from a different generation (X) I've seen and experienced the internet from the beginning and man was it exciting at the start of it. When I started out with ICQ and going on chatboxes people really were excited to just being able to talk to someone from the other side of the world. I can't recall it ever being like this back then. I think this really is a lost generation, indeed a generation of idiots has been born just like a famous scientist once predicted. Technology really has surpassed human intelligence and there fore human interaction.\r
It's painfully obvious that Europe is led by the wrong hands.
Those Arabs again, please. When you charge a 1000,00 for a freakin room a night you should at least be able to do whatever the hell you want.
This is why all these women marchers are stupid, it's this topic they should worry or march about!
I kind of like Trump (non American) for what I think he will be able to do but even I was like thunder struck by that god-awful speech. Within the first minute I was like common 'you already got the position you don't need to hammer it in' what he should have done instead was try to surprise his opponents with a little softer or friendlier side wich I was hoping for. It would have been really smart if he would have put some real effort or thought in his inauguration speech trying to convince some people that he isn't that bad after all. Nobody adviced him or wrote his speech for him that's for sure. He's just so undiplomatic it's unbelievable. Yet I don't see him as an evil man, ofcourse I worry about his stance and future policies on environmental issues etc but I think and really hope that along the way he will come to his senses about this highly important issue that simply cannot be ignored anymore. Thankfully a whole lot of people around the world seem to acknowledge these facts now. People forget that government really isn't a one man's job, not even in America. 
'Moroccans' to answer your question. You'll find that bit out by yourself if you'll go. Don't let that stop you though:P Dutch people are generally open and friendly.
What a bunch of puritan nonsense is this still in this day and age especially coming from the US. This major BS all the time about something being too sexual while the whole American society is sex laced. You can't find one female singer or star that doesn't look and act like a cheap hooker in their music video. All the while this is an ff-ing statue are these peeps at FB offices for real? What they should worry about is portrayal of violence or glorifying of it wich is in no way hindered, not in games not in movies "and ofcourse it has no influence at all". *sarcasm alert
Sorry you're just a bunch of kids. Get some real life experience.
BS
Someone who uses the words free and democracy in the same sentence doesn't understand the true state of affairs in this world. 
I don't believe it, I think it's just fake news.
Faith aka religion is the peoples poison. 
Awwwwwwwwwwww that's soo nice.
You don't know what you are talking about.
You don't joke around about stuff like that kid. Is something wrong with you? 
Facebook and Google will merge with Apple and become Skynet.
That was never a true Buddhist that said that, no way. I agree you can be a Buddhist and disagree with certain people but to stop an act of kindness or humanity is a bridge to far if you are a true Buddhist.
Hooray for China the new leaders of the world and fu** Donald Duck.
Ofcourse there's a bias, tell me who on this earth is unbiased? Nice those educated words, you put something in a hypothetical box and label it so now what? It is just my opinion on a matter I have followed for years. I make a quick judgement about you're age by your response and I guess you are about half my age. (I could be wrong though) so I had at least 20 years on you seeing this puzzle unfold. If you're an American you are sure to be even more biased towards Israel because of the American Israel relationship. In terms of politics I regard Israel almost as a part of the US.
That shit took forever ! meanwhile billions and billions were made. 
SNAP feeds poor families, but it, nor any of the programs born of the Great Society/War on Poverty have done a fucking thing to actually end poverty
Welcome to our new world where more people are busy looking at their bloody phones and filming something than dare to act like a human being. This is the smart revolution, isn't it great?
The downvoters are nothing but uneducated ignorant millenials and spewing out some random witty words doesn't change that. I didn't wrote a single thing that is untruthful or illogical. Ask people who lived in Fukushima or Chernobyl how safe it all is.
What you wrote is absolute nonsense. First of all Buddhism isn't really a religion, it's a practice that deals with you're own mind and actions. You don't rely on an outer source or God, there is no concept of heaven or hell (as in after life) Some people think this is nirvana or samsara but those two are actual states of being. For heaven or hell you must die. Nirvana is the ultimate state of bliss something you can attain in this life (for instance when you are meditating) Samsara is the self inflicted pain or suffering we go through because we cannot detach ourselves from our desires and try avoiding suffering without attending to it's causes. Buddha himself was one of many enlightened beings in this world, he never asked anyone to worship him. He just became a great symbol and example. Secondly you may have read something but you didn't understood it's meanings. Always be careful when reading or interpretating old texts or scripts. Many stories are mythical, the mistake people make is they can't seem to read what the underlying message is. You can't hardly be any more peaceful than a Buddhist if you are practicing it. We Buddhist respect all life even animals. An end note worthy of being said is, even Buddhist are people and so yes there are some bad stories to be found. 
Nuclear energy is not safe and never will be. Also the waste problem which is a by product is an immense unsolvable problem. We humans simply don't learn as well it seems. Nuclear energy and even more nuclear weaponry should be stopped forever and ever. If people that have kids would want to vow to create a better world start with this. The big problem is we've seen something, we learned something that's takes a responsibility bigger that we can ever handle. Abolishment is the one and only correct answer.
Indeed 500 million is like pocket change for a company as Facebook, the profit numbers are just ridiculous. Check their last quarter earnings.
They should ban diesel engine cars everywhere in Europe. Especially in a country like Belgium where 99% of the people drive diesel cars, it's ridiculous. Diesel is one of the worst fuels when it comes to the environment. Also very bad for you're health directly. It should only be used for industrial purposes until there are better alternatives. What is even more ridiculous when it comes to Belgium is that the ignorant government there actually gives the people an incentive to choose diesel cars sinds they don't tax it higher than petrol.
I don't get the simple minds that can joke about matters like this. Just because this isn't happening in your backyard it is happening in your world. Ignorance is not bliss.
3. Regarding the actual caption (sorry guys:) the EU warning the USA or Israel on anything is a joke not even worth telling. The amount of influence that the EU has in anything regarding these two combined forces is comparable to pissing in the wind.
And these are the people we idolize yet these rare fat cats are the reason of the whole post 2008 disaster world were in right now. You think hey didn't profit with subprimes, derivates, credit default swap's etc aka any of these scandalous activities?
Exactly the right number! Japan seems to understand what many of our countries here in Europe do not. (although that is beginning to change as well) When people talk about muslims or refugees or simply economic immigrants I don't understand why nobody even questions why 'their' own holier than holy brothers like the Arab Emirates, Dubai, Qatar etcetera don't even want them. These oil filthy-rich states where the police are driving around in Lamborghini's have all the room and all the money in the world, why don't they intervene? They don't even want them! There they have sharia law plus they are swimming in money. (I thought islam faith was against capitalism??) Nobody even talks about them, there is you're religion of peace. You're own brother's don't even care maybe they simply know better.

After killing 69 people you lost you're so called human rights.
You guys don't understand what Buddhism is because you're not interested in it. You are only interested in trying to win an argument. Buddhism at it's core is very simple and can be explained in a few lines. All the Veda's and papers written are not Buddhist bibles and should not be seen that way. Yes there are small different forms and shapes of temples and customs depending on the country. Buddhism is a practice, if you don't understand that you are in the wrong. This is not about a western version. I spend a long time in Thailand among other places so I understand at least their version very well. 
'Skynet' is getting nearer and nearer.
Exactly... and that is just one of the problems. 
Was that supposed to be a trick question lol
Justice served but where is the picture?
Maybe it's irrelevant to you, I state what I think is more important here. About Putin being accused about being involved in doing such things is laughable. Putin is a real leader who doesn't spend his time pressing keys on Twitter like that monkey Trump is doing. 
Because they're smart? Secondly polls don't mean shit, you can make a poll or survey go anyway you like. It all depends on what outcome you want for starters.
I hope president Trump will put an end to this madness. (I am responding to the US build up and troops) This is the big test in my opinion, his reaction to this situation will show his true colors. As he is now the new commander in chief I am watching this very closely. But who knows who is really in charge behind the scenes, we will find that out shortly I think.
A nuclear engineer right wasting his time on a time waster like reddit alrighty then. Anyway I am not an engineer but tell me you don't think month's and month's of leaking radiation water into the ocean and into the ground water doesn't affect nature, wild life, fish, the fish we eat ? The same fish and marine life that we are already infecting and polluting with plastics, this all doesn't do any harm? It doesn't matter how much book knowledge you possess, it doesn't matter how many pseudo scientists or engineers downplay the dangers of nuclear energy, it isn't safe or sustainable by any standards. I am a logician and I don't need the reassurance of someone else in the form of a degree to be capable of critical thinking.
I wholeheartedly agree with Mikhail Gorbachev who was a great and peaceful Russian leader. It is somewhat frightening what is going on especially if you can read between the lines. There is a sense if sensibility missing in today's leaders. What's even more scary, there's a whole generation that seems to think something's only real when it appears on their phone screen. A huge part of these entitled young millennials that comment here really think that their neat little lives can't be disturbed by anything. It's because their only sense of struggle is 'if they can afford the next iPhone'.
You're a soulless brainless kid, have you ever seen some victims or footage from Hiroshima or Nagasaki sick kid. You don't even joke about that if you have some respect. Ofcourse you would need a brain to know what respect really means.
Nothing wrong with the taste of Jack Daniels, it's not a boy's drink it's a man's drink. It also has a secret ingredient that when someone drink's it that is not a real man it doesn't taste that well :)
I think you missed my point, in honesty I didn't know that there was a status in which a refugee could work before they get a green card. On the other hand that is not so much what I am fired up about it's the contemptuousness of companies like Star Bucks that are ripping people off but somehow remain undamaged no matter what they do. The fact that they actually sell in the figures they do is just astounding to me. Check how much a Colombian coffee farmer gets for a month's labor, it's more lucrative for them to grow coca leaves. It's this globalists over the top 400% profiting that needs to stop. Therefore I don't buy into Howard Schultz message trying to be good as a company, he is just using momentum and politics as a marketing scheme to grow even more popular. This is misplaced on many levels.
All lies, there are more than enough criminals in The Netherlands and more than enough acts of crime. The problem we have is a lazy parrot government and lousy, soft and incapable judges. The same goes for our police, our police officers just get laughed at. Belgium is even worse. Check for instance Badr Hari he only has to go to jail for 6 months for beating someone to death. On another occasion we let a notorious hardcore women trafficker and abuser from Turkish origin who was already in jail go to take a break (verlof) and disappeared abroad. I can tell you 1000+ stories more just like those. The Netherlands judicial system and it's punishments are a joke. In 2002 a famous and upcoming politician called Pim Fortuyn was shot and killed outside a Dutch radio station. The murderer named Volkert Van Der Graaf did some time behind bars and is already free and walking our streets. We don't need to close prisons instead after reading numerous sentences some judges should even be locked up. We need more authority and competence in our weak and outdated system of law and order.
Globalization isn't working for anyone. It has only worked to make a small percentage extremely rich like say Amazon. On the other side all this extreme economic growth is putting millions and millions on the breadlines' hard to even make a living. Subsidized farming etceta it is all ludicrous while some on the end of the global stick are reaping insane amounts of wealth by for instance Starbucks the coffee growers in say Colombia are getting next to nothing in return. While big supermarket chains sell you tomatoes flown from half across the globe some small local farmers can't make a living anymore. While the better half of this world reap the short time benefits of easy buying anything you want at the click of a mouse button we cannot see what happens to make all that happen. It's just unsustainable, because of the insane amounts of resources, energy, pollution and human sacrifices that are being made. We are only catalyzing our early demise on this planet by our ever greater greed and need for artificial satisfaction to live our lives.
You guys don't know what the fuck you're talking about. China isn't perfect but it's far ahead of America in many ways. 
Who cares about these silly studies, WHO? tell me what is their purpose? I think you know the answer to that already. You can make a study to go any direction you want. 
Japan, China devaluing their currencies? Please wake the fu** up. If any currency is devalued it's the US Dollar. It isn't worth the paper it's written on with you're 20+ Trillion and counting in national debt! But you're scandalous real government the Fed keeps printing money like there's no tomorrow. Money that is not backed up by gold anymore. Worldwide several countries here in Europe have already taken back gold that is parts stored in NYC , something that hasn't happened in the 40 years I'm alive don't you guys understand what that means? It means that the world don't trust the US anymore. That's why the whole world is raising it's prices for goods going to the US. You're money is worthless.
there is something in add remove programs for office.
This is not racist it's anti religion. Or maybe just an insurance fire to get a bigger building. It seems though they didn't trust allah enough to take care of it so they launched a crowdfunding campaign as well. Religion is poison.
Turkey was always like this. Erdogan is a real dictator pig with an ego twice the size of Trump's. Turkey should never ever become European. The EU is already fucked up as it is no need to make it worse.
We humans are still the savages we once were, we hardly even left the cave in real sense of time. We've only swapped our sticks and spears for modern weaponry that includes the possibility to kill everything that lives on a massive scale. If that doesn't scare you at least a little when you let that information sink in.. I don't know what does. Making 'funny' remarks about something this serious is only a sign of absolute ignorance or a total lack of imagination.
Some people rather die than open their eyes to what's going on. You could stand in front of the mount Everest and you wouldn't see it. Political correctness is the disease of the ignorants and it's rampant.
I think Europe (and I am European) is making bad and stupid decisions. Where there is a real threat nothing is being done yet where there isn't one.. unless there's something going on 'we' don't know. I don't see Russia as the enemy. It's our own leaders that are rotten to the core. The UK made a smart move I think. It feels uneasy being in Europe right now to put it lightly. It's like a cheese that's been eaten from by many rats at once, if we wait a little longer nothing is gonna be left.
Instead Starbucks should start paying tax, cut their prices in half and start paying the coffee farmers some decent money.
Better start stockpiling your maple syrup this treat could potentially become a lot more expensive.
It's not about not having fun. It's what you make fun about. If you don't understand that yet maybe you need to grow a little older. One day you will be a whole lot wiser and a whole lot more thoughtful. You're respons tells me you haven't seen or experienced much in life. 
I am not pro muslim by any standards to say the least but it's a fact the state of Israel does whatever the fuck it wants. Drop bombs on civilians, put homes on soil that's not theirs and all this is backed by Americans. Also whenever you say anything about that or actions against those are immediately regarded as anti-semitists, it's ridiculous and disgusting behavior. When I was young I thought those stone throwers on the news that we have all seen for years and years were the bad guys, I don't see it like that anymore. The hamas is also misunderstood I think, they are just a reactionary movement that logically evolved because of the US's and Israelis inhumane treatment and actions.
I agree for 200%. Those are "the new parents' call em parents generation 2.0. First they let others raise their kids so they can earn more money. Secondly they behave like teenagers on their phones. Some people just shouldn't have kids. It would be a whole lot better for this world anyway for a large part of humans to either stop fuckin', use contraception or whatever it is we need to do for this human overpopulation going rampant on this planet.
Just the nuclear waste that is piling up around the globe coming from 450+ nuclear facilities is madness and is an unsolvable, unmanageable problem, a problem that doesn't disappear in thousands of years. We are creating forever growing no-go areas in this world for generations to come. If anyone sensible wants to check some of the scary facts a nation like Japan already faces look for a documentary video about their severe nuclear waste stockage problem. They are now basically stacking the waste inside their nuclear power plants out of necessity. The reason being behind it is they are having problems building and financing these incredibly costly nuclear waste storage facilities. Another reason is Japan simply doesn't have that much room to incorporate these type of places, obviously you just can't put these places in people's backyard.
Ignorance is bliss 
America's new lapdog visited that dirty swine that has an even bigger ego than Trump. Dirty alliances are being build again nothing really changed.
Next to nothing, it's at the same scale as Apple indirectly pays it's foxconn employees.
I would like to see they wrestle this out. Obama vs Putin. They get one uninterrupted round of 10 minutes. No guns, no knifes man to man. On second thought, hell everything is allowed:)) I bet a 1000 Bucks on Putin 10 to 1 :) who's in?
We here in Europe are also tired of all the biased left or liberal news telling us what to believe, all in the name of the EU. It is time to resist here, against this European Union 28 country disaster. It's time for some European people to wake up! The American citizens weren't stupid to elect Donald Trump. We need some of that vibe over here but Europeans are too soft too indifferent it seems to even care. Our borders are open to everybody with a sob story. All the while everybody can see where this is going, nowhere! Like Donald said in his last speech "A country without a border is no country".
Don't get mad at your crazy cousins for saying out loud what y'all have kept quiet for years...\n\nParliament and 10 Downing is rife with boyfuckers who were kept in a supply of boys by an insane looking weirdo that was the A&R point man for the BBC
Fucking brutal, mate
All I see is grass teeming with ticks and other bugs *itch itch itch* 
I don't care who downvotes my comments I really don't loose any sleep about it. What I will say is this, people babbling about China this China that don't have a clue like I said what they are talking about. Okay let's talk about manipulation, if China manipulates it's currency or not isn't even of real concern to me because I weigh that off against the country complaining about that. Now if anybody in this world manipulates anything, it's the U.S. With it's 800 military bases, the Fed reserve, sanctions, mega corporations etc (all in the name of democracy ofcourse) I think they far outreach any other player in this world if we are talking about influence or manipulation. Hence why you guys are called a superpower. (even though you have trillions and trillions of debt) but that's okay you just keep printing some more money while the whole worlds markets are based on that same currency that is actually not even worth the paper it's written on. But you guys get away with that, now THAT is manipulation. Any other country would be bankrupt dead and buried by now but because of you're major military force and with the help of mega corporations and some smart moves you manage to conquer and thrive. But when someone else in this world try and does the same and want something of the pie too you Americans act like a spoilt brad who doesn't want to give up it's toys.\rWhen talking innovation or environmentalism China is way ahead of the U.S. when we talk about real investment numbers, real efforts that they are making. They already have several complete eco friendly living projects running (including a small city sized one) where is the U.S.'s ? Ofcourse it's not perfect and they still have a long way to go but China has made a giant leap from where they were to where they are now.
And what about that vapor crap that is so trending right now. (even though you look like a douche while doing it) this chemical crap is also just junk.
We all create our own karma every day, cannot receive any from others lol. You are probably talking about the reddit karma , hell I don't even know how that shit works. Anyway why all this racial bs all the time? I am not out for sensation with this post, all I read is one stupid and ignorant human being is damaging a coral reef. I just cannot understand people like that, I don't care where the heck they're from! 
90% of the US government is nothing but a bunch of crooks and bankers married to the military. The biggest corporations own the lobbyists in turn own the politicians and control what decisions are being made. And these crooks do anything and everything to get what they want, which is more money and more power. This new clown in the white house is not there for the people, he is allowed and choosen by the machine above. Some people believe all they read, it's divide and conquer that's all it is. The people in charge have no heart for anything or anyone besides themselves. They will scorche and bleed this world dry until there's nothing left to take.
Just ban it totally makes much more sense. These half ass measures all the time. Just ban it or don't ban it.
For some reason I find it difficult to understand why this Bitcoin thing is still around. Although I have found it an interesting concept from the get go. The volatility of the value of Bitcoin together with the vague controls of this IOU, not to mention the overshadowing criminals* issue who tend to like this untraceable currency, it puzzles me who other than someone that wants to laundry vast illegal sums of money would want to be interested in to buying Bitcoins.
Wake up call, there are a whole lot of things were not prepared for by the slightest. There is a never ending list of possibilities of things we haven't even have a clue about I am sure. When human life is terminated in the foreseeable future I am sure, all that will remain on this planet are billions of cars and iphones and mountains and oceans full of plastics as lost relics of a gone species who thought they were god.
Messages like this just confirm that we humans barely left the caves. It doesn't matter how many wars have been fought and how many atrocities have been committed. It doesn't matter how many people have died, we haven't learned a thing. Maybe it's in our DNA, kill or be killed just like in the rest of the animal kingdom because that's what we are.. mere animals.\rWe will be the only species that really killed themselves, I believe it will happen one way or the other. It's just a matter of time and prefered method. We will become extinct by either ignorance or agression. Environmentally we are already on the right track poisoning our earth and heating it up at the same time. Nuclear war is just option number two. 
Ofcourse Star Bucks should be boycotted and by everyone with a sensible mind. Now they just gave me yet another reason not to be seen in this hipster brothel. Very smart move from Star Bucks to play on "the good side" it makes for good marketing plus you don't have to pay refugees that much I guess (it's a win win) hey wait a minute, are refugees technically allowed to earn wages..? I don't think so. For starters let them start paying taxes worldwide and pay the coffee farmers who do all the real work some descent money if they wanna be civil! And O start cutting your ridiculous prices in half because no coffee in a paper cup is worth $5.50
Unbelievable there are still ignorant f***'s left out there. 
Their " special relationship", what the hell does that even mean? It's just the US-UK relationship nothing special about it. Well maybe the role she will play 🎭 namely his English lapdog when I heard her talk. Again not the slightest attempt to caution or rethink his policies on for instance his ignorant stance that global warming is a hoax, presenting the world he is gonna fire up the "clean coal" plants again. It's a disaster.
POLITICALLY, I would argue that the model does apply \n\nEconomics aside, reunification in Germany literally happened almost overnight, with almost no poor affect POLITICALLY. \n\nThe same could apply in NK/SK if conditions were amenable. I would argue that the greatest obstacle politically is neither NK nor SK, but rather, China.
It's not like that in CA. May-issue CCW and they overwhelmingly decided that they may not issue. 
First of all it's Fukushima not Fukishima , if you start about getting your facts right. Second it's not at all okay, contained or under control. More than 300 tons of radiation water is leaking into the ocean every single day. I could write a whole lot more alarming facts here but do you're own research not only read reddit postings. If you don't think just this single fact all by itself is nothing to worry about go visit this area and make a couple of selfies while you're at it. The radiation level is so high they can't even get to it with humans. Besides I've read and seen hundreds of articles about this topic from various sources on top of that I am somewhat of a logical thinker but logic seems something lost from today's world. My credibility doesn't rely on having received likes or votes. We've already seen what that does  with people's thinking only recently. People don't wanna hear the truth if it's inconvenient. I don't just echo of here because I want to battle entitled kids who only think something is real if it appears on their iPhone, it is out of real concern. Don't downplay the severity of something you obviously don't have a clue about. \rThe fact that seven people downvoted my first comment says a lot about how dumb-downed this new smart-fed generation is. 
What if they just get it of Ebay ?
There are a bunch of clowns in the white house. It's business as usual. In some shape or form the majority seems to think "this time it will all change". Every 4-8 years people tend to experience total memory loss, it's almost like they think this 'new commander in chief' is Jesus. He will save us all, he "will make America great again"? "Government by the people", seriously?  Go ahead pray to you're imaginary friends in the sky. God bless America 😂 
Let them please, Twitter is just one of many useless apps the world can do without.
No propaganda is needed to denigrate Merkel. She is doing a fine job denigrating herself by her own actions. This bitch needs to go.
You are the ignorant one here. There is nothing pretentious about what I wrote. The fact that you misinterpreted the message by being misled about the word god sais it all. I don't believe in god as such so tuff luck what I just meant was how fucking high strung ignorant and thinking like we are the top of creation kind of species we've become (hence I used the word god because I don't know a better word to describe our behavior) it wasn't a religious statement but a way to tell the story. So next time you respond to someone learn to think for 60sec longer if you really understood the meaning of something or instead just keep using you're lizard brain.
Religion is poison.
2 can play that game, ofcourse.
It's people like you who keep making thing's difficult that are not. If you feel triggered I am sorry to have hurt you're precious feelings. I live in the same world as you and have been for 40+ years, how long is you're experience? A rational argument hmm oh my god have to look that word up, it sounds so  intelligent you must be right. I can assure you I'm a logician by the purest standards so making a rational argument is my strongpoint. However the truth hurts, some people rather hear a sweet sounding lullaby  than awaken to the bitter truth.
2. Trump is also pro Israel (duh) him talking with that asshole Netanyahu was his first significant meeting in office. Ofcourse his partner in crime knows all about wall's. With Donald Duck in charge the US of A could become an exact copy of Israel's standards, something I would worry about if I was an American citizen.

Yes indeed it would but it's inevitable that is exactly what is going to happen at some point in time.
Ofcourse it does. By making jokes you are downplaying a situation whereby other even  les enlightened people than you could think everything is okay, just like the global warming issue. You're language also displays a problem with mentality. It's okay we all have to learn something some time.
Trump wishing the Chinese a happy new year of the rooster 🐔 11 days after the festivities  is nothing more than a disguised insult. Trump is an ignorant buffoon that underestimates China's capabilities. The Chinese play a far better game.
I think we should give everybody guns it's a lot safer, someone of the staff could become the culprit. Everybody should have the right to defend themselves. Also ammo should be sold at the schools at discount prices, we certainly don't wanna discriminate against anyone who can't afford to buy bullets to defend themselves. 
It's not Reddit though but "the world".
It IS the source of modern terrorism, not the only source but a major source.
Ofcourse we do. We're fed up with this pseudo religious bullshit and act's of terror being shoved down our throats on a daily bases.

How do you insinuate this from what I said ? If you weren't trained to crew a tank, then of course you would be useless without training.\nThe silo issue aside, as this was never my argument, TACTICAL nuclear arms could very easily be deployed by a militia whose members had training in use of artillery or armor. Personalizing the argument limits the capacity to a militia to operate without YOU. This was not at all the argument I was making.

The fees associated with Ticketmaster have always been egregious, hence the lawsuits they have endured.\n\nWhat you're witnessing now is price gouging, as the music industry have found that, unless you are a superstar selling millions of records (not so common any more), the only way to make money in the music business is through touring.\n\nTicketmaster is just taking their cut.

What a snappy comeback\nAlmost as cogent as "I know you are, but what am I ?"
I think you, like most people, are talking out of their ass when categorizing the current system as archaic because the path to legal immigration is slow and cumbersome\n\nLiterally yesterday I was accused of "knowing nothing about immigration policy, and am I even aware that the path to legal immigration and citizenship can take literally years and you probably don't even have any real understanding of why that is..."\n\nTo which I immediately replied "of course I know what it takes so long. Because the law currently limits immigration from any single nation to a maximum of 7% of the total immigrants allowable by law. As Mexico and Latin America are where the highest demand for immigration originates, the wait for prospective immigrants from this region tends to be much longer."\n\nResponse: fucking crickets. I don't know if current immigration policy is just or unjust. I DO know it is the law. Violating the law has consequences \n\nThe one thing I rarely hear from on anyone, PARTICULARLY those who demonize the current administration's immigration policies, is a coherent reform of current policy, which is clearly unworkable.

In the US, in nearly all 50 states (I will have to research conclusively)\nestablishing that an accused criminal is not guilty due to mental illness or insanity is nearly impossible.

You are terribly misinformed.

So you're correct there there are what might be considered mitigating circumstances The following statute defines the procedure for submitting an insanity defense. As u/ElvisGretzky has pointed out, it is basically a moot point. Insanity and Not Criminally Responsible as a defense are just not really viable in the US, except in very limited cases. The last case I can honestly think of is John Hinckley, who attempted to assasinate Ronald Reagen. Keep in mind that case was 35 years ago. Had it not been a President that he took a whack at, I'm certain he would have been one more crazy fucker convicted of attempted murder. Even 35 years later, Hinkley is only now being released from supervision.\n\nhttp://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(faqokc3z13cuerdtbxekpzpt))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-768-36\n\n

You must not know much about nuclear weaponry. There's no such thing as a low-yield hydrogen bomb.

He was attempting to JOIN the Taliban.

He was treated poorly while in American custody. Nevertheless, he was trying to join a radical terrorist group. His failure to do so merely delayed his further motivation and he ventral success at doing so. With the added bonus that he was able do pay for his eventual total radicalization, and likely pay for others to do so as well

So what you're saying is that if I limited the discussion to citizen militias using conventional shells (HE) in artillery, this would elicit the proper gravitas to make you and your coworkers actually...I don't know... do some fucking work ?\nWhat part of the argument is so off ? You are adamant that a militia could not field personnel capable of manning field guns, either towed or self propelled ? Because the tactical nuclear shells require almost zero training, aside from handling and storage, beyond what is required for conventional shells\n\nMaybe you and your coworkers should ease on back to doing something useful

I wouldn't exactly call the NYT a bastion of precision, but it is ironic that they cite a lack of precise statistics in record keeping as it concerns girls participating in the sport \n\nThe overwhelming disparity in gender participation speaks for itself. Several girls have won big, seemingly all at the 103 weight class. One girl was even robbed of competing for a state championship in fucking IOWA, literally the capital of competitive amateur wrestling. \n\nMy experience is measured in a somewhat intense interest in the subject, and several family members that have competed at the state level in high school. Anecdotal, maybe. But much more precise than asserting that girls win "often enough"\n\n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/sports/28wrestling.html

We definitely still possess, and continue to develop new tactical nuclear weapons. Most are designed for potential deployment with NATO, though a new class of so called adjustable yield weapons are being designed for use in South Asia, to meet a perceived threat from Pakistan. Additionally, they are being developed to eliminate nascent, though as yet unrealized nuclear programs in places such as North Korea and Iran. The idea is to have capabilities to target underground weapons sites with minimal collateral damage \n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/as-us-modernizes-nuclear-weapons-smaller-leaves-some-uneasy.amp.html\n\nhttps://www.extremetech.com/extreme/221064-us-presses-on-with-tactical-nukes-despite-outcry\n\nhttp://www.defenseone.com/business/2015/06/report-us-needs-new-small-nuclear-bombs/115765/\n\nhttp://breakingdefense.com/2016/03/beef-up-conventional-forces-dont-worry-about-a-tactical-nuke-gap/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Saying YOU are paying for it is a tortured argument. I'M paying for it as well. This very salient bit of information dilutes not only the amount YOU pay, but also your opinion on the matter
To be more precise, the US currently claim it has destroyed its tactical nuclear capabilities for artillery or tank deployment. This may or may not be true, my opinion is it is likely sort of true\n\nIn December 1996, NATO pledged to refrain from deploying tactical battlefield nuclear weapons (weapons deployed via artillery or tank) on all new NATO signatory territory. This agreement did not hold NATO to any standards for non expansion nations as it concerns such weapons, excepting preexisting treaties.

Well what you're describing is already sort of illegal. Hypothetically, let's say I have a gun and you want to buy it. First, I have to have kept that firearm in my personal collection (not in a listing or actively for sale) for at least 1 year. If for example our paths crossed at a gun show, you can't buy a gun that's sitting on my for sale table and avoid a background check, but you could (hypothetically) buy the firearm I'm conceal carrying provided I've owned it personally for 1 year. Second, I can't sell, let you borrow, give, or gift a firearm if I have any shred of evidence that you are a prohibited person, or if you don't reside in the same state where the transfer is occurring. Finally, I have to keep a written record of the sale/transfer. \n\nRemember this only applies to sales between private citizens. If I'm doing business as a dealer, I have have have to enter your info into NICS and you fill out a 4473 for the background check or I'm losing my license and going to federal prison. \n\nThere's so many legal opinions and legislative writing about this my thumbs would fall off before I typed it all out. Read all of that above and change the word gun for car and you'll see why it's hard for people to justify what is essentially an expression of free trade and commerce with some restrictions seeing as firearms are in fact dangerous devices. Further, keep in mind that only 10 percent of gun sales are private citizen-private citizen sales. One example I stumbled upon was Columbine. Even with all the legislation in the world, neither Harris nor Klebold were prohibited persons at the time of purchase. And even if they were, who's to say an illegal sale wouldn't have occurred?
The reason for the "Shall not be infringed" type of rhetoric, while somewhat standoffish, does have its merits. \n\nIn VA, where I live, getting a CCW can be done by taking a test (online or in person) and filling out a form. Now this may seem a bit too easy however you have to consider different types of situations. Not everyone has the time or money to wait an extensive amount of time, pay licensing fees, range fees, and testing fees. The point is to make self-defense as accessible as possible for everyone. That includes the banker buying a $1,200 Kimber and the battered wife that can only afford a $250 Charter Arms .38 Special to protect herself from her drunk husband.\n\nAnd the part about accuracy/shooting tests I do kind of understand, being a shitty shot myself I would want to increase my skill before daily carrying. That being said, research shows that most DGU follow the rule of 3. 3 shots, 3 seconds, 3 feet or less. Doesn't take much skill to land 3 on a target at 3 feet. \n\nSo you can kind of understand where not wanting to put more regulation in front of ordinary, law-abiding citizens who want to purchase guns is coming from.

You realize that all insurance basically works like this. You pay a certain amount of money into a pool that is utilized by people when they need it. You could go your whole life without an auto insurance claim...that money goes toward somewhere else who does file a claim. \n\nSocialized medicine just makes it so people aren't dying or going bankrupt because their numbers on the screen are smaller than the hospital's numbers on a screen.

um i have had to do that on purpose on a server 2008r2 machine that got stuck. I ended up just blowing away the machine and redoing it \n
so then there is no problem then because they would be rolled to tmo...
The question is do you have wireless? if so you can do a wireless camera in the corner.
You can always pay for your own return label...
I also believe they are using different controllers.
Thats part of the problem construction should be a well paid wage not bottom tier immigrant work. 
They may have the most active members because of bases but pennsylvania has the largest  national guard in the country.
Ive traced through worse and done a direct path and replace... I would have taken a picture but wasnt allowed to...
Tiny is involved but it aint pretty...
no more like  aweek so
They spec to the top end chip that is currently out because that is the only thing they can certify with. This is just like the old am3 boards that with a bios upgrade could go to am3+
Do you have a link to the vid by chance?
http://www.androidauthority.com/java-vs-c-app-performance-689081/\nThere is a difference not a tremendous one but there is. I have done this for a long time as well. \no and fyi java is an emulation engine...
Do you really think they already arnt?
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JqgHbj
No you are wrong. The layers between the browser and the cpu do matter. Android doesnt run most of its code bare metal. There is an emulation engine between most of the code and android itself. This emu engine does slow stuff down significantly.
Not always easy alot of places arnt near anything. 
I have the same issue with my fury x this hasnt harmed it in the year and a half i have had the furyx .
So the real question is why did they bundle a cooler that isnt compatable...
I mean the fact he even counted rounds and changed mags was so different from the normal that it helped.
Is that the corsair 460x? 
Not everywhere they have alot of LP ones where im at.
Im ok with this i detest caps lock as i work with accountants and they perpetually leave caps on and its a pita.
not really one is a performance one with a seperate controller the other is a basic one. Its a cost thing.
yea im a solo network admin / support so this does not work. 
What is this Firewire you speak of??? /s
If you like chrome try vivaldi not nearly the memory hog that is chrome but is still a chromium browser.

I cant wait till i can see how well they do on a self contained unit like the h110iv2
Well in all fairness a monitor can be an aio. 
So how was it?  Did it taste like a pancake, have the same consistency? 
Yum.  I like a clean work space.  :-) 
Oh damn....I've never heard this before, this is awesome. \n\nedit:  Even more respect to these guys.  Just read the leader singer, Ralph Saenz, holds a Ph.D in English Lit from Berkeley and was an asst. professor. 
Don't feel too sorry, her story never happened.  No rape victim is going to be jailed for "public lewdness" in the U.S.  She's looking for attention. 
Hey!  That looks like a little me with less hair. 
I would say that definition is quite narrow, it says *children*, adolescents are not children. 
No, they are interpreting court decisions and Monday morning quarterbacking. 
LOL  Too cute. 
Oh OK, thanks.  
My mom used the whiskey on me and all my brothers when we were teething.  She'd never admit this but out dad told us she would sometimes slip a wee little bit into our bottle to help us sleep.  Before anyone loses their shit and calls my mom a bad parent, her children were born between 1950 and 1973. 
I gots me a big dick and I'm pretty bright as well. 
I woulda been like: is *all* of you big? 
Every time I see this picture of him that overbite just kills me.  
LOL  Nice!!  
It reminds me of the sound a very young puppy makes when it's looking for it's mother. 
who cares, get over it, it happens.  Whining on reddit isn't going to fix it. 
And just imagine how much they have seen of the world change.  Can you imagine what the world will be like when you're 90. 
OMG!  He is precious.  After a kinda crappy day this photo made me smile. 
He's technically correct.  Pedophilia is a sexual attraction to children who have yet to reach pubescence.  Pederasts are sexually attracted to post-pubescent adolescents.
Oh yes, the conservative fall back: when one lacks a cogent argument resort to name calling. 
So...this crazy sues because crunchberries aren't real berries but not for the trauma to the soft palate from eating those rocks?  Bitch missed out.  
Why do you dislike him?  I'm an 80s kid but was never into the skateboard scene, we didn't really have that in my part of NJ at the time. 
Oh christ, get a fuckin grip and stop reading PETA 
you're a shitty asshole that obviously never outgrew high school. 
Ohhh yea! 
LOL  This made me legit laugh because I had this EXACT conversation with my ex-bf, who also hates onions.  Except, in his case it isn't because of the taste, it's the texture he doesn't like, which I countered with "But you won't even notice it, mixed it with everything else" to which he replied "doesn't matter, I KNOW it's in there, just use onion powder please." 
Yummy!  Nothing like a med/well steak with a little A1 and a baked tater. 
Be nice or I'll have to spank you. 
You can't remove a sack when the cyst is infected like this, the wall is very thin and weak, it will shred. 
Maybe because the other players in the game have stores all over the world and it would cost them millions to outfit those stores to make one blind cry baby happy. 
THat'll leave a bruise. 
No, they had an accident and than hung the creature correctly.  Jesus, get a grip and grow up.  This was 1916, they had no understanding about animals the way we do. 
And don't forget they were getting ready to go to college and that rap album was bout to drop. 
You and your mom are a couple of hot Bangladeshi girls.  I'd go straight for ya...haha 
Sorry you're being downvoted for being correct.
I tried da weed a few times in college and I was so disappointed because I never got the munchies.  First I got a wicked erection than I got super sleepy and that was it. 
It's funny, the illegals thought they were making some grand statement, like we couldn't function if they skipped work but guess what...their little temper tantrum didn't effect me or my schedule one bit and it didn't effect any one I know.  
They wanted some of dat white boy ass. 
Nope, he was murdered because he wanted a divorce, at least according to speculation by the prosecutor. 
http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/06/14/how-to-make-epic-pancakes-with-your-japanese-rice-cooker/
You'd be wrong.  When asked, the prosecutor speculated the reason for the murder was because the guy told the wife he wanted a divorce. 
So very true.  I'm the youngest of 5 boys and at 43 I've already lost two brothers. 
I'm sure plenty of parents still use the whiskey on the gums but the reddit crowd can be so holier than thou when it comes to old school parents doing shit like slipping it into the bottle without realizing that back than it was considered perfectly fine for a mother to smoke and drink during pregnancy and for fathers to spank their kids. 
Old people fights are the best! 
LOL  I nearly forgot about that feeling.  My dad would put a towel down on the backseat so we didn't burn to death. 
I found if you mix about a tablespoon of peroxide into a capful of detergent than pour some on the stain and work it in, it takes blood right out and doesn't bleach your clothes in the process.
and neither are you.
So you killed a 10yo?  Not cool dawg. 
Having gone to school or reading the Constitution does not make one a lawyer or a scholar anymore than having watched brain surgery on Youtube makes them a neurosurgeon.  There is a reason why you have to be licensed to practice law. 
> You can tell because it's in 5 other subs too.\n\nSource or you're just another low life shit poster. 
The state would disagree with you.  They gave him a posthumous pardon a few years back.   And those articles are based on what the sheriff said, the same sheriff who forced a confession, probably by way of physical violence. 
Gotcha. 
There is no evidence to support a detrimental effect. 
Not particularly, but thanks for your concern.  
No, it isn't terrible in the least and I would suggest you leave the relationship.  Schizophrenia is a very serious illness and it sounds like your BF is exhibiting some serious symptoms.  \n\nWhat I would STRONGLY suggest you do is speak to his therapist at the hospital and tell him or her that you intend to end the relationship.  Telling him once he is released can have all sorts of unforeseen and unintended consequences, the least of which would be him not taking his medication and relapsing (which will probably happen, schizophrenics tend to have med compliance problems, esp. newly diagnosed patients).  If you talk to his therapist first than either the two of you can break the news to him in the controlled situation of the hospital or the therapist can address it with him during their therapy sessions. \n\nSince you are concerned about his living situation, by telling his therapist of your intentions they can make arrangements for him to find a living situation before he is released.

STOLEN VALOR!!!! 
You make some good points and I think the most important is one you're missing...an open relationship is not for everyone.  Obviously it is not for you and that's ok.  I tried it once and it didn't work, so now i know, never again.  
C'est ca ca
You really shouldn't use big words that you clearly don't understand. 
Apparently you care since you're getting your wittle feelings hurt.  Since you love the illegals so much, how about you let them into your neighborhood.  Oh yea, you won't, typical "not in my backyard" liberal. 
So, what I get from this is that this family think mental illness is something to be ashamed of and instead of trying to help the man they instead chose the route of mocking and degrading his illness. \n\nNot for nothing but I suspect the ex-wife wrote this, it has vindictive ex all over it. 
Is it painful to be such a raging low life? 
OP mentioned in an earlier post that she was a murder victim. 
Years ago I was a substitute teacher.  I was working this one assignment with a class of 2nd graders, we had just finished story time and I gave the kids some pages to color.  As the little darlings were sitting there quietly coloring I looked out at them and it suddenly dawned on me "if something happens, if some psycho comes busting into the school, these kids are my responsability. Their parents sent them to school this morning, having never met me, probably not even knowing I was there and they are trusting that I will defend their child, perhaps with my life."  It was a sobering moment for me, knowing that 30 sets of parents were trusting me to take care of their children. 
That version was forever ruined when I caught the meme circulating a few months back.  It's a picture of super fat Axl and the line "Knock, knock, knocking on the kitchen door."   LOL 
LOL  I'm horrible, that last sentence made me laugh.   It reminded me of a story a buddy in college told.  He was working with a girl who had Downs, he decided to play "toss the ball" but apparently she didn't understand you had to catch the ball because my buddy threw the ball at her and she caught it square in the face.  True to form, instead of freaking out the girl just laughed and laughed. 
Check ebay, I bet people are selling back issues. 
lol
*hug* 
Am the youngest of 5, can confirm.  Oldest is the golden child than they gradually get worse until you reach me, I'm the one where they turned down the griddle and got a pretty decent kid. 
The presence of nerve endings in a part of the body doesn't inherently make it useful.  It is speculated that the foreskin evolved as part of a natural defense mechanism to keep things from the urethral opening, this same speculation has been used to explain the presence of public hair.  Now if this hypothesis is correct than the foreskin has outlived its usefulness for modern, Westernized humans since we no longer need protection due to the presence of clothing and modern hygienic practices.  \n\nThe foreskin is now more of a problem.  There are a number of medical conditions that can result by leaving the foreskin intact and in contemporary times, presence of a foreskin has been shown to increase your risk of contracting HIV and other STI's, not to mention contracting other infections that are the result of our clothing. \n\nFinally, if you're going to claim that the foreskin is natural and it needs to be left intact than you also have to not clean the foreskin because the build up of smegma is merely the body's natural cleaning mechanism for the foreskin, I don't know one person who is uncut that is not going to clean it. \n\nThis whole argument, about keeping the foreskin intact is a contemporary invention, brought about by the same crowd who latch onto any issue that involves telling other people how to live.  There is absolutely no legitimate medical evidence for keeping the foreskin intact.  As I said, it no longer serves a purpose but has a ton of negatives.

Yes, I have.  I just ignored them and walked away.  You can't reason with people like that and you're playing a dangerous game by outing yourself to them.

YOU leave you un-American, yellow coward. 
What did your dad say? 
That's because he owns the Christian Broadcasting Network. 
Because it doesn't matter if they are legal, illegal or whatever, the fact remains, their temper tantrum did nothing. 
Well you guys don't really help your cause by continuing to elect psycho republicans and fucking up national elections. 
This makes sense from a natural standpoint.  If you look into history, whenever we've had massive loss of human life (e.g. The Black Death of the Middle Ages) there has always been a spike of child birth that follows.  So it stands to reason that nature would also slow down once we reach maximum growth.  
Wide receiver?  :-) 
Two dudes yelling at each other in a bar, it's on the edge of a fist fight.  The little dude says to the big one "You have one chance to shut your mouth before I butt fuck you and than sell your ass for some chips and kool-aid."  Big dude busted out laughing, fight averted. 
Sorry for hijacking but how the hell do you post to this forum?  I can't find a posting link anywhere on the forum front page. 
Well so far as I am aware, the little tantrum didn't affect anything.  And I'm not a snowflake princess, so drop your little attitude before you really get triggered. 
People who believe main steam media is their altruistic friend are dangerous.
Back then they would sometimes bury an unknown under a short description of how they died so they could find the grave again if needed.  But even in modern times they don't always bury a person under a John or Jane Doe, sometimes they give the person a "name", especially if it's an abandoned/murdered child or a murder victim.  
Uhh...NO!!!  
Actually, it has nothing to do with liquids, it's because when muscle burns they shrink, that shrinking can cause all sorts of things to happen with a body.  
Hopefully the SCOTUS comes down in favor of America.  I'm so sick of my tax dollars being wasted on these cockroaches who take advantage of our system.  Don't want a shot to the head, than don't throw rocks at cops.

haha  Very true.  I'm from NJ and I distinctly remember the late 80's, early 90's every old Italian and Jew from Jersey was gonna retire to Florida.  
But what if Jesus tells you he knows a short cut, are you really gonna tell Jesus to stick to the directions/ 
Sweet!  Thanks my man/woman.  :-) 
Totally agree.  I'm reading some of these replies and all I can think is "what a bunch of bitchy, whiny bottoms." 
Yea, a whole range of STDs if the bottom is a whore and infected.  STDs don't magically appear once a cock goes in raw.

It's so refreshing to come to r/news and see sense.  No name calling, excuses, or misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nThank you.

How self-righteous.  This only reinforces the fact that socialists are just kids that don't read history books.
What's wrong with having all options?  \n\nHow is it any different from other positive things that discriminate based on other physical features, like a Spanish college fund?\n\nNo one will actually tell you this but many kids are put in boy scouts because they don't have a dad or strong male role model in their life.  Having it be a "guy thing" is important to many current and past boy scouts in a way most people not affiliated would have trouble understanding.
Don't worry mexico I'm sure America will miss all you did to stop drugs and security issues from crossing the border. The effect you were having is SO APPARENT.
Trump was right.  The media is the enemy.

The problem is outsiders dictating what a legal private organization can do based solely on their feels.\n\nThere are plenty of group who will take you camping.  Leave boy scouts alone, they didn't hurt anyone.

In those times we had factories and they didn't.  So lots of Americans could go do unskilled work and still make the neatest stuff.\n\nThen everybody got factories and go from having nothing to having a tiny bit and they love it.  So now everybody has the same neat stuff and it's pretty much worthless to our now (rightfully) inflated American standards.\n\nSo one American says "I'm gonna go make a new "factory" none of those guys have, like Google or Facebook.". So he creates skilled labor,  which then becomes the norm and leaves to many people out.\n\nThis is literally all my 5 year old cousin would understand so I hope I'm close.\n
So nobody was doing their job eh?  That should make this little falling out pretty easy.\n\nNext youre going to tell me americans are sending drug to mex.... O MY GOD...
Yes!  Maybe even a couple dogs. 
I don't think most people are lazy, just either content or defeated.  They don't think they can do better.\n\nThere are so many options out there, from temp agencies to going back to college.  (Seriously, just START a degree in computer science and you will start getting emails begging you to apply to several $15 an hour internships)\n\nYou decide what your time is worth and I believe just about everyone is aiming a bit low.
All of these subs are a joke but they keep making them to get past the all filter.\n\nTruly pathetic.

Here's an idea, don't slave away at a job for 7$.  It's no one's fault but your own if your working a job you don't feel fairly compensated for.
The only thing I've notice is purposefully leaving information out.  Like when news anchors talk about the clinton emails but not what they revealed or that trumps "muslim ban" countries were countries recommended by obama for having failing governments who could no longer satisfactorily screen visa holders coming from their country. 
Blaming boy scouts for girl scouts being shitty is probably how it got shitty...

Nothing wrong with wanting to be paid.  My point wasn't that they are shit for reporting news, my point is they don't do it out of concern or altruism for the people.  \n\nIt's clear they are just as willing to post a hit piece on some nice guy as they are willing to report major news.  Doesn't matter as long as it's brings traffic.  That is unethical.
Well if you're not working then you are part of some under class so I'm sure the stagnation caused depression will fit right in.

It's true dude.
If the boy scouts is forced into letting in girls I hope women's shelters are held to the same standard.
It's pretty cut and dry.  They are stuck between the EU and the swedish citizenry.\n\nThey had no choice in taking these people and now they have to keep face while it causes the obvious issues.  I don't blame them for doing PR but out right denying any problems is disingenuous to native Swedes.\n

Bullshit.  Please overturn it courts.
Feasible, but hilariously expensive.  The proposed wall would also be built over remote and inhospitable terrain, and would require serious investments in infrastructure to get the materials necessary to build it to the actual construction site.\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/602494/bad-math-props-up-trumps-border-wall/\n\n>After initially proposing to wall off all 2,000 miles, Trump said the wall could run along roughly half of the border, with mountains and other natural barriers blocking immigrants from crossing elsewhere. And on the portion where Trump envisions a wall, there are already 653 miles of fencing—some designed to stop cars, some to stop pedestrians, depending on the likeliest mode of crossing in each section. Building those fences has cost $2.3 billion since 2006.\n\n>If you wanted a wall instead of a fence—and if it truly were, as Trump has promised, 35 to 65 feet of concrete reinforced with steel—then the costs would mount extremely fast. Imagine a 1,000-mile wall, at a height of about 50 feet, the middle of the range that Trump has thrown out. Then suppose the wall extended 15 feet underground—a little more than is structurally necessary for a foundation, but enough to deter some tunnelers. You wouldn’t really build a long wall at a constant thickness, but let’s assume that on average, it’s one foot thick—enough to make a 50-foot wall stable and hard to cut through, a concern that Trump and his supporters have raised with the existing border fence.
It also mandated a preponderance of the evidence standard, which is kind of a problem when dealing with allegations that, if true, allege a felony. \n\n>Thus, in order for a school’s grievance procedures to be consistent with Title IX standards, the school must use a preponderance of the evidence standard (i.e., it is more likely than not that sexual harassment or violence occurred). The “clear and convincing” standard (i.e., it is highly probable or reasonably certain that the sexual harassment or violence occurred), currently used by some schools, is a higher standard of proof. Grievance procedures that use this higher standard are inconsistent with the standard of proof established for violations of the civil rights laws, and are thus not equitable under Title IX. Therefore, preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard for investigating allegations of sexual harassment or violence.\n\nDoE guidance on "due process" is also extremely nebulous, going back to a 2001 letter noting that FERPA doesn't change due process rights, and otherwise limits it to whatever process is "consistent with any federally guaranteed due process rights involved in a complaint proceeding."  This has basically proven to be a toothless guarantee in many of the more high profile cases as it treats what should be a criminal matter as a mere administrative issue. 
I was a finance major graduating in 2009.  That was a good call up until, like, my last semester. 
In all seriousness, run this up the chain through your servicing JAG office.  Mine had a similar issue, but I'll be damned if I can remember how we resolved it.
I'll admit, I find it interesting that early in the last century and the one prior, open carry was the norm, and conceal carry was the hallmark of thieves, assassins, and brigands.  Afterall, an honorable armed man makes no secret of the fact he's armed, as he doesn't intend to do anyone ill will.  I'm real curious as to why its shifted.\n\nIn either case, a pistol in a holster is significantly less of a threat than a pistol in the hand.  In the same way, a rifle or shotgun in one of these positions (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dqFPKVfp0oA/T6BjMgqSt0I/AAAAAAAAAGs/7iSa4nHtA-I/s1600/Three+Ways+To+Carry.png) isn't an immediate right-this-second threat, whereas carrying in the low ready seems like more of a threat.\n\nThere are ways to avoid demonstrating an imminent threat despite being visibly armed.
There is a widespread belief in the military, especially the Army, that being honest on the questionnaires given at every health appointment, will result in mandatory referral to substance abuse "counseling," and all the professional fallout that entails.  If that wasn't actually the case, I'm quite confident people in the military would be more honest with the ones who actually are in the best position to counsel on the risks. 
Its complicated...\nhttp://flsalaw.com/practice-areas/government-employees-exemptions-from-overtime-pay/paramedics-and-first-responders-exemptions-from-overtime-pay/\n\nIn my jurisdiction, comptime and overtime just require pre-approval from the employee's supervisory chain (not sure how further up its withheld).

At least in my organization, we legally review FOIA requests.  And, depending on how good the FOIA guy is, we also end up having to train them.  I'm not sure how the STATE level FOIA would work on this (keep in mind that actual FOIA is federal, and states have their own versions), but I wouldn't be surprised if the police staff attorneys spent time and effort making sure the exceptions are applied correctly; especially as, in law enforcement, there is a lot of information that might be disclosed that shouldn't outside of a court room.
You are aware that the border is already largely fortified and, as you said below, already uses natural barriers... right? \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_barrier\n\n
There's a great book called "Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland."  It tells the story of the broken, old men who couldn't be sent to the front who carried out most of the liquidations.  This may shock some, but apparently the Soldiers didn't particularly like having to shoot men, women, and children on the edge of ditches.  Instead, they preferred to have the local collaborators do it, often while rip roaring drunk, because, again, who actually wants to be a trigger puller for little children?  Highly, highly recommend.
I'd rather be in the USDB than in any civilian prison.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/160ggp/iama_convicted_felon_who_spent_time_in_military/c7rjg13/\n\nAlso, the USDB apparently had a perfect accreditation score, which many civilian facilities would not.
Why am I the only one who likes pants without a jacket?  
She ordered her department not to defend what she believed to be an unlawful executive order.  Big difference between that and "defy the President."  The AG is the lawyer for the United States as a whole, not the President (that being the of White House Counsel), and is supposed to only defend those laws and actions they believe "just" and "lawful."  The statement about "betrayal" came from the Office of the Press Secretary, here:\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/30/statement-appointment-dana-boente-acting-attorney-general.
I stayed in a hotel at phoenix for a week for a business trip. The hotel had 2 pokestops within range of my bed (which was great for stocking up while doing work).  The unofficial trackers worked for that time, and I saw that I could have walked in literally any direction and stumbled upon any number of pokemon I'd dream about catching where I live, ignoring the awesome ones that spawned within range of the room.  The game has two different worlds, and players who live in the land of plenty don't seem to get what its like to not. 
Actually didn't think of it as "Hurr durr salty," more like that's what I call going to work.  
Are you at LRMC or in the stuhl proper?  In either case, there is almost no parking outside of on Kaiserstrasse that doesn't allow 24 hour parking.  The residential areas don't really have parking limits to my knowledge on the street; I can't speak to the big lot by Blarney Stone.
At least it doesn't restrict overtime and comp time.  And I hope you aren't going out and being a hero and violating the antideficiency act. 
Don't forget that 2ID, the ADA, and the ESC all issued MORE restrictive curfew policies, requiring you be in your assigned barracks slot, and not anyone elses, or off post at a hotel, or just somewhere without a pass.  Go out to borrow something of your buddy's at 0130?  Curfew violation.  
Germany is weird, the "installation" is multiple smaller bases spread out all over the damn place.
Go to TDS, and stop asking for advice from internet people. 
At least in NY the transit cops are state troopers, which means you just brought yourself a hearing date in state court, not local. 
This isn't a suspension of the refugee program, it invokes 9/11 to both suspend refugee admissions to the country, but also to then ban travel from 7 countries that were not associated with 9/11 (such as Saudi Arabia).  Obama had previously suspended the visa waiver program for travel related to these states (such as dual nationals of other countries, those who entered those 7 countries recently, and so on).  \n\nAs I prefer to listen to people who are smarter then me on these things, the real HUGE problem with the EO is that it was poorly written and not adequately staffed and not adequately coordinated with the implementing organizations (such as DHS) to minimize risk of litigation (of which there is a ton due to the mishandling of people who were already given valid visas, and lawful permanent residences of this Country).\n\nhttps://lawfareblog.com/malevolence-tempered-incompetence-trumps-horrifying-executive-order-refugees-and-visas\n\nThere are multiple acts of congress identified at least in this article that seem to conflict with the EO, but I'm not an immigration lawyer, so I'll rely on their analysis over my feelings on the matter.
Dude, as someone who was in your shoes a few short years ago, learn something about the job you're applying for.  There are no "civilian JAGs," JAGs are commissioned officers in the military, and there is a lot that goes with the job as far as lifestyle and responsibilities.  While there are Department of the Army civilian attorneys, you'd apply for that through USA Jobs.  
>(no ones even coming for them)\n\nBoth Hillary and Trump advocate banning guns for those on the no fly list; an opaque administrative list with no known criteria and no real due process for getting off of the list.  Both of them.  One cannot say with a straight face that they are any different on a lack of respect for the 2nd Amendment, and yet the Trumpites refuse to acknowledge it.
Its right wing moral-hypocrisy mongering, especially with regards to Streep.  "How can the left back someone like Streep when she criticizes the President for mocking a disabled reporter, when she wants a pedophile released?  They are quick to burn Milo down, yet refuse to do the same to their side! They are all hypocrites, and should be disregarded."  That's what that dog whistle is about. 
That authority was removed from every Commander above Company grade, except at formations.  However, good luck choosing a uniform of the day that your senior rater's senior rater is not a fan of.
I'm in Germany; its slim pickings in most of the places I've been in (or so it seemed).  Nothing like San Fran at least. 
It grinds my gears that the claptrap Starship Troopers is part of reading lists (or at least was for a bunch of our junior enlisted at my current unit) but Forever War is conspicuously absent.

You are aware that the executive branch has not increased in size since 1999, and the last time it had this current level of employment was the 1960's, when the nation had half the population... right?  Just making sure, because there has not been any true growth of the size of the executive branch in nearly 20 years. 
Q: What are the thoughts on allowing beards?\n\nA: The issue is currently being openly discussed with the CSA. Input was solicited from other foreign services like the Norwegians. Current assessment as to the likelihood of beards within the Army is 50/50.\n\nI did the Nijmegen 4Daags March, and while I was having my bloody feet bandaged by a Dutch Medic, him and his buddies were all laughing at the Americans, as we have short hair and no beards.  I can only hope that, one day, I won't have awful razor burn every working of my career.

Trump wants to disarm people on the no fly list; an opaque, secret list with unclear criteria for membership that has swept up infants and sitting senators.

I appreciate your sentiment, but when it comes to budgeting, retention and recruitment are a line item with a pretty valid purpose.  While you might disagree with them spending their recruitment/retention budget in this way, its a pretty effective way to get a general patriotic message to a very, very large group of people.  
That is on par with the people who post comments on DuffleBlog thinking its real.

NCO's aren't officers; they're generally much closer to the ground pounders than the higher ups.  That and there are a whole lot more NCOs than officers.
http://reason.com/blog/2016/06/15/no-fly-list-no-guns-trump-agrees-with-ob\n\nTrump is a fan of using the no fly list as a means to restrict gun ownership.  You wouldn't even need to have a rap sheet; just administratively put on a list that has extremely minimal means of redress.  Its even more insidious than what you suggested.

Pretty much; just to quote from Lawrence v. Texas: "Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now is overruled."\n\nNo reason they couldn't do that in this case.

I'm glad we discovered that the SLQ for single officers in Korea didn't constitute a "barracks" under the punitive policy letter on Alcohol, otherwise every apache pilot (and lawyer) would have been facing disciplinary action.  
I've practiced labor law in a jurisdiction without the federal unions.  Its actually pretty easy to fire an employee for cause, but in my experience, a lot of managers don't want to be the bad guy. \n\nYou've also brought up another problem with the hiring freeze: now the Government needs to decide if they'd rather have a high, drunk, waste of oxygen doing a job, or nobody, because they cannot replace the high, drunk, waste of oxygen with anyone.
We need a service uniform like the marines have to correspond to a suit/business casual, and a dress uniform separate from the service uniform, to correspond to civilian black tie, for ceremonial and fancy functions.  Right now, we decided to smash the two together for no discernible reason. 
> Oh this election was about hating upwards. The whole establishment was on Clinton's side and a good chunk, if not an outright majority, of the Trump supporters absolutely loath everyone at the top. \n\nThere did also seem to be a fair amount of loathing of immigrants, Muslims, and refugees (though that might be encompassed with "Muslims).  So there was a fair amount of downward scorn as well.

Nothing mitigates the chance of a lawsuit being brought.  You can sue anyone for anything.  However, you won't get very far.  
Its generally illegal to respond to minor, non-felonies with lethal force.  There is a whole line of caselaw about spring guns being put in abandoned barns, which end up killing and/or maiming children.  Basically, if you couldn't use deadly force in person, you can't use deadly force remotely.

You might need help with reading comprehension.  I said "do not trust." Don't read more into it than that.
No.  The watch list is stupid.  Either title someone with an offense and charge them in Court, or don't.  Regardless of if you are a liberal or a conservative or neither, you should be in favor of due process and not arbitrary, unreviewable, opaque "lists" by the government used as a basis for denying someone rights of any kind.  
The FBI doesn't indict; the DOJ does.  Sounds like Loretta Lynch's fault.
They'll also ask for collateral.  If you have a simple drunken assault, you might post $500 bail.  Don't show up?

She's not "required to obey his orders or resign," nor did I see indication of "actively try and make her department work against him."  \n\nhttps://lawfareblog.com/quick-thoughts-sally-yates-unpersuasive-statement\n\nThis gives a much more in-depth view of her statement and does a good job pointing out the weaknesses of her reasoning that I think you'd probably agree with.
Going to correct you letter you sent mandated "preponderance of the evidence."  The document makes it clear that OCR, when determining if a school is in compliance with Title IX, will utilize the standards set in that document.\n\n\nIn this document, they state the following:\n\n\n>Thus, in order for a school’s grievance procedures to be consistent with Title IX standards, the school must use a preponderance of the evidence standard (i.e., it is more likely than not that sexual harassment or violence occurred). The “clear and convincing” standard (i.e., it is highly probable or reasonably certain that the sexual harassment or violence occurred), currently used by some schools, is a higher standard of proof. Grievance procedures that use this higher standard are inconsistent with the standard of proof established for violations of the civil rights laws, and are thus not equitable under Title IX. Therefore, preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard for investigating allegations of sexual harassment or violence.
And now they can't be replaced. 
Same thing happened to one of my coworkers in Cologne; he ended up breaking his leg trying to chase the pickpocket. 
I know several cops.  Because anecdotal evidence is still evidence, and can reasonably be assumed to be indicative of a wider trend absent contrary evidence, they tell me that people get a lot calmer and more polite with them once they know the camera is on. 
His plan was a tax on remittances to pay for a border wall.  We already have a border fence, so I'm not sure what a wall would do that a high security fence would not, but what do I know.  Also, "what happened to the wall?" would be a pretty good counter-campaign in 4 years.
I volunteer as tribute.
That would imply that Niantic has actually cleaned up a mess they've made.  Near as I can tell, they haven't.  If we're the histrionic housemate, Niantic is the roommate who had a perfectly clean house, and then silently threw all their dirty crap around, got rid of the TV without saying why, and then put up some half way decent posters in the common room. 
Does it usually direct the Director, OMB, to establish a plan to decrease the government through attrition?  He also promised this on the campaign trail (hiring freeze to decrease size).  
He'll take away guns from anyone on the no fly list.  You know, that bureaucratic, opaque, secret list that everyone from infants to sitting senators have been put on?  He's cool with taking away someone's right to liberty and property without due process of law if they're on that list.  However, the Trump supporters I've talked to, who label Hillary a gun grabber, don't seem to see the issue when its Trump.  And not like the no-fly list could be abused for partisan political reasons... right?\n\nhttp://reason.com/blog/2016/06/15/no-fly-list-no-guns-trump-agrees-with-ob
Article 92, UCMJ (and its explanatory notes)\n\n(2) Failure to obey other lawful order.\n\n(a) That a member of the armed forces issued a certain lawful order;\n\n(b) That the accused had knowledge of the order;\n\n(c) That the accused had a duty to obey the order; and\n\n(d) That the accused failed to obey the order.\n\n(2) Violation of or failure to obey other lawful order.\n\n(From the explanatory notes)\n\n(a) Scope. Article 92(2) includes all other lawful orders which may be issued by a member of the armed forces, violations of which are not chargeable under Article 90, 91, or 92(1).\n\nSo that is quite literally how it works: the order is presumed "lawful" unless there is some reason that shows that it isn't "lawful."  Not to say its a good idea, but that's how this works.\n\n
Not only that, but it's like missing the coupon expiration date. Deal closed, man. 
Hey dude; there's no shame in getting evaluated for inpatient treatment, same as if you had a crushed leg or ebola.  \n\nNo one is going to judge you; I know several Soldiers, both junior enlisted, senior enlisted, and Officers, who've spent some time in inpatient mental health treatment with absolutely zero effects to their career progression or treatment in and around their work places.  And as an attorney, very little would bring me more pleasure than absolutely demolishing any command or organization stupid enough to retaliate against someone who actually does the right thing and gets themselves checked out. 
You alright there buddy?  Rough day in the salt mines?\n\nI misread your post as "what part makes this a thing they can do" referring to the counseling/ban/whatever you want to call it, not the ability to impose the UCMJ in response.  They can issue the order, and kick it up from there.
It isn't an argument; its a distraction or a deflection.  Its not meant to appeal to you; its meant to appeal to other like minded folks for whom holding the moral high ground is very important.  Same thing when Limbaugh ham-handedly said that rape is equivalent to threesomes and homosexual sex.
And for active duty, our spouses.  Its hard enough to get a job every 2 to 3 years in a different location when following an SM around.
I did the Nijmegen 4 days march; the only reason I think I still have feet are the Daener socks.  Expensive, but so damn good, and thin enough to still let your feet fit into your boots after 3 days of swelling and bleeding.
The creators advertised the game as having tracking (in a really cool way that would be AWESOME if it existed currently, and probably could client side with google map-like directions) and with people in cars and on bikes.  How again was this designed solely for walking when the creators envisioned alternatives?
The curfew came back because a dude torture-raped a Korean student, and it was done to placate the angry, angry horde that showed up at the gate the next day.  
While that might be true (I'm not an Ohio attorney), the federal standard is preponderance, which, in a Title IX case, would preempt state law on the matter.
When I reported to my first office and stood at attention for the OIC, she called other people around to "get a look at LT!"  Had a lot of "d'awws."  Still, better to do it like that the first time and downgrade from there.
The guards have yelled at me plenty for trying to park there, and that hill sucks.  The areas off Kaiserstrasse seem to have tons of free, no time limit street parking, for what its worth.
Finance as a field of study doesn't require you to personally have money; it isn't all just stock investments (most of my classes related to treasury management and analyzing and forecasting profits, cash flows, and so on.)
Its great, because you actually have to be told what you're accused of and that they want you to incriminate yourself, and that you don't have to (there's a friggin script on page 2 of the form).  And people are like "yea fam, lemme tell you about all the illegal shit I did.  And when I'm done telling you, I'mma THEN demand to not speak anymore."  
I got mini medals for my mess to get married in.  Marlow white's weren't bad, and they will arrange it how you like.  Unless you have any existing minimedals, I don't know if I'd go with anodized.  I have anodized, but they almost look cheap and fake.  The non-anodized look pretty nice.
Gun manufacturers are protected by The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA); as groups like the Brady center were bankrupting smaller firearms manufacturers with the threat of lawsuits.  While one could proceed against Niantic in a "negligent failure to warn" type setting, they'd probably fail based on the warnings in the game (Don't drive and play), and the fact that its pretty gross user error to play a game while driving. 
Very nice.  I love that place. 
I pay for a personalized email address, and have had the same email address for over 20 years now. I've kept it through several ISP changes, and several home address changes, including moving to different states.  I've watched others change from AOL to ATT.com to Verizon.net to gmail, do apple's .me accounts, and now @icloud.com accounts.  All of this time, I'm staying with my original .mac account name for my purchased content and iCloud access, and a completely separate email account for notifications.\n\nI wish we could have IDs that were not based on what company we're using at the moment, but are permanent person IDs that transcend corporate allegiance.  That way, we could have one ID that's solid, that would be used to identify us to whichever company needs our ID, without having to worry about which brand we're talking to.
I did just that, 15 years ago. No more kids from me.  My wife and I have stopped at replacement levels (two of us, two children), and my sister and her husband stopped at one.  My niece has also stopped at one with her new husband.\n\nSo, my family line is well below replacement levels.  Thanks for asking.
If I were you, I'd consider this an assault on our Civil Rights and the right we might have to own the means of our own self defense.  The 2nd Amendment doesn't mention "guns" anywhere in it.  If the 2nd Amendment is made null, then *any* weapon in the hands of the people is grounds for criminal prosecution.  Pick up a stick?  could be a felony.  Have a bottle in your hand during a verbal argument, could be used as a weapon, hence you are "armed."  \n\nI can live without ever buying another gun, but.... I do think I want to live in a nation where the people are never allowed to be armed.
I may have bought my last internal combustion engine based car already. I have a 2011 Jeep Compass and a 2013 Nissan Leaf. The Jeep does get used - when the Leaf has been taken somewhere else by my wife, and I can't walk to where I'm going, and the weather is too bad to ride my bike.\n\nGenerally speaking, though, if the Leaf is available, we take that. It's quicker, in that it has better acceleration than my Jeep, more nimble, easier to park, cheaper to operate, cheaper to insure, and I generally just like it better.  \n\nNow, if I'm going to go on a LONG drive (more than 150 miles one way), I will most likely take the Jeep.  I do this because it does take a bit longer to charge the electric car (a Level 3 EVSE takes 40 minutes or so to charge my Leaf), and there are fewer charging stations available than gasoline filling stations.  But, I don't go on those long trips all that terribly often.  Mostly, I drive under 25 miles on a given day - well under 1000 miles per month.\n\nAs soon as we have long-haul electric trucks available, with 250 mile to 500 mile electric only range, I'll buy one to pull a camper. Even better, for me, would be an electric only RV, with a 500 mile electric only range. I'd buy one of those, for certain.  \n\nOne day, perhaps, we will have self-driving electric "mules," passenger-less tow vehicles that can pull a 5th wheel RV from one campground to another, or pull a boat trailer from one's house to the lake.  They can do their job for a few bucks then scurry off to pull something for someone else.  Then I would not have to own a tow vehicle at all.
Wait a second... we have white people "identifying as black" now, and men identifying as women.  Why can't you be a man who "identifies as a woman, who also likes sleeping with women, and is therefore a lesbian?"
More people died of legally prescribed medications than of lack of helmets or seat belts.   Should we make pharmaceuticals illegal?
And the first amendment only covers words issuing from your mouth or things written on parchment by a quill and ink.
Ah, the wonderful, never dishonest police.  Only a few bad apples, right, guys?  
Yes, that's true.  Black thugs and Hispanic gang members (and those who sympathize with them) are scum of the earth, also.  Reasonably nice, ordinary white people, black people, hispanic people and such are fine, though.\n\nWhat was your point, again?
That is correct.  I am smart enough to know that the risk to me is higher if I "try to do something about it" than it would be if I just avoid them.\n\nThey have all of the advantages, here.  They are armed, they have the legal system on their side, and largely, they have public opinion on their side.  I am one person. If I took on one cop, I'd be essentially taking on all cops.  That's just foolish.\n\nSo, yes, I do not trust them, and I think they want to harm me, but I am not going to "take them on."  It would be like swimming in a small lagoon with 1000 sharks and deciding to just go out and attack one, thus bringing all of them against me.  Stupid.
Why would you worry about whether the center for DISEASE control compiles crime statistics when we have a bunch of agencies, state and federal, who's job it is to pay attention to crime?
I've watched cops for over 50 years.  I've had them as friends, gone to their parties, known people who have been married to them and who have dated them.\n\nI've watched cops on good days, and on bad days.  On their best days, they seem to be happy to help people. At worst (on their best days) they are more interested in letting people slide for things that they consider inconsequential, preferring to look for more egregious crimes to arrest people over.\n\nBut that's the point, really.  Cops are not out there to help anyone; they are out there to arrest people.  If they wanted to help, they'd be firefighters or EMTs or something.  What they want to do is to use their authority to inflict harm to bend people to their will. They want to give people tickets, to fight with people (hit them; causing pain) to physically restrain people who don't want to be restrained.\n\nBasically, the entire job depends on people who like physical and emotional confrontation and dominance. These are classical bullies, who can only enjoy their job if they enjoy making someone else's day worse.\n\nTell me how I'm wrong, here?  If you say, "it's about justice," then you are once again missing the point.  The police are not supposed to "inflict justice" on people. The only job the police have is to use force.  The "Justice Department," lawyers and judges, deal out justice.  Justice is just "inflicting an equal and commiserate level of pain and suffering to counter the crimes committed."  But, once again, cops don't deliver justice, they enforce.  They bully, and issue tickets, and sometimes kidnap people.\n\nIf you're a cop, and you don't know this about yourself, you need to do some deep reflection.  If you're married to a cop - get used to an abusive relationship.  Cops beat their wives at WAY above the national average.  They are inherently abusive.  It's just their nature.
Oh, okay.  Only one kind of discussion allowed here, and that's how bad white people are? Fine.
The batteries that we use TODAY can be charged and discharged at a very high rate.  This is how we can have 800 horsepower electric drag cars without the batteries blowing up.  A battery that can be discharged at a huge rate can be charged at the same rate.  \n\nI spoke about the fact that my car charges at 6.6 kW under normal conditions.  The battery pack is rated for 90 kW.  That means that my current battery pack could (in theory) charge 13.6 times faster than it does today.  For simplicity's sake, let's assume that we would only ask it to charge 12 times faster.\n\nAt 80 kW of charging, I could deliver 21 kW to the battery in about 16 minutes.  My battery pack (24 kWh total) only has a bit over 21 kWh "usable" energy, due to a reserve the system imposes.  \n\nIf we assumed a larger battery pack, half an hour of charge would be good for two to three hours of drive time, depending on how fast you drive.  That's with today's chemistry, and more energy delivered by the charging cables than what is currently legal.
Seems reasonable.

My point is that violence is not about the tool. It is about the people. If a population is not committing lots of non-gun related violence, adding the ability to own guns does not make them suddenly become violent people. \n\nSo, if you think that banning all the guns in the US will solve all the non-gun related violence, can you tell me what the mechanism is that make s people violent when a law is not in place to control something unrelated?\n\nIf the US populations where gun violence is a big problem were without stabbings, blunt force trauma, rape and other violent crime, you might have a point.  If guns just caused crime by themselves, I would be all for banning them. They don't.
I tend to think that there really is no such thing as an ideal car.  Or ideal vehicle of any sort.  There are always compromises. If the Leaf serves your needs 99% of the time, then it's pretty close to ideal for you.\n\nI have been married for close to 24 years now.  We have never been able to be a "one car" family.  We now have an SUV, a Leaf, a Motorcycle, and my eldest son has a pickup truck.  I have, at one time, had a large pickup truck rather than the SUV, and we used to have two bikes.\n\nIf I had to drop down to only a single vehicle?  it would be a very tough choice. I could go with the Leaf, and just rent a truck when I needed it.  That would be the more responsible route.  I could stay with the SUV, since it's "more versatile" while giving up all of the things that I love about having a small electric car.\n\nAs things stand now, I drive the SUV during the cold and/or raining days, while my wife drives the Leaf most days.  If it's nice, I'll often walk to work, or to the local stores, and ride with my wife when going out to the movies, out to eat, or anywhere else we go together.  If I'm going a lot farther, or if the weather is really nice, I'll take my motorcycle.\n\nStill, we've dropped down to under about 3000 miles per year on the SUV, even with long weekend trips included.  I'd be willing to bet that I could drop even owning the SUV without too much bother, and have the Leaf as my ONLY car - but that's right now.  In two or three years, I don't know if that would work, after range degradation.\n\nI still get 90 miles of range during warm weather, 70 miles during cool weather.  Of course, I've only got 33,000 miles on my Leaf, and it has the upgraded chemistry when compared with yours.  What will it be like in 3 more years?  Maybe a lot like yours, down to 40 miles of range. \n\nAt that point, I will most likely consider either having the battery replaced, and ensuring another 6 years of useful life, or buying a new electric car with over 200 miles of range available.  Maybe by then, we'll have a 200 mile range, 4 wheel drive, self-driving, crossover SUV that can pull a decent load when it needs to, and I can have my ideal car.
$500,000 is a rounding error when talking about UBI.  I love the idea, but it will be silly expensive.  I just don't see the rich people allowing this to go forward fully, as most of the money would have to come from them.
Not that sea ice in late September or early October is that important (and if they are claiming no ice as early as the middle of August, they are out of their minds) but....   It would be more sensible to put up huge sunshades to reflect the sun's direct rays on the water than to make ice.  This would allow IR to escape the surface of the water, which is a lot warmer than the surface of ice, and the rate of heat transfer is dependent upon the difference between the temperature of the hot part of the transfer and the cold part of the transfer.  Also, exposed ocean water cools by evaporation, which would be cut off by covering it with ice, and by convection which would be curtailed by covering it with ice.\n\nSo, open water, shaded from the sun, is the fastest way to cool the Arctic Ocean.  Making an ice cover for the Arctic after September 15th is the opposite of what they should do.
It's nearly an hour north of Atlanta.  Hardly a suburb.
Honestly, you have no idea what you're talking about.  If you think that laws prevent criminals from having guns, take a look at the nations of Central and South America, all of which have more restrictive firearm laws than the US, and all of which have higher rates of violent crime.\n\nThere are nations where the people are just less violent than the people who currently live in some of the bad areas of the US.  If we got rid of all of the guns in the US tomorrow, would those violent people stop committing rape?  Would they stop stabbing people with knives?  Would they stop beating people with blunt objects?  All of these activities happen more frequently now than assault by assault weapon.
Actually, most of them get the guns from the black market, and the sellers got them from legal private sales.  There are 300 million guns already in the public in the US.  It's as easy to buy a gun today as it is to buy a bicycle.  Some of them will be sold at retail, some will be sold at garage sales, and some will be sold in an ally to a shady, possibly illegal, purchaser.  It's just the way things are.
I think the best idea is to be a farmer.  With enough power available (through solar panels or nuclear fusion or whatever), one can pull water from the air, shine light on the water and grow plants hydroponically.  Produces food and oxygen.  I'd essentially live in a garden and sell food and water.  
Yep, they are.  But... how much power do you really use in a day?  Have you ever really thought about it?  The US average is [901 kWh per month](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3), or about 30 kWh per day.  The people who pay attention to these things say that we, in the US, average about 5 hours of "full sun" per day, which means on an annual basis, we get enough sun to generate full potential out of a solar panel for about 5 hours per day.  More in the summer, less in the winter, of course, and more or less depending on where you live.\n\nSo, say you need 30 kWh of electricity per day, and you get 5 hours of sun that can be relied upon to deliver that energy.  That means that you'd need, what? 6 kW worth of solar panels to power your entire household.\n\nBut, remember that you get a lot more sunshine in the summer.  What if you geared your system to be fully sufficient in the summer, and knew that you would be dependent upon other energy sources for the winter.  You might very well only put up 2 kW worth of solar panels, and use that energy to cut your summer bill to almost nothing, spring and fall down by 80%, and winter bill down by 10%.\n\nWorth doing?  Even at 20% efficiency?  Could be.
Can we stop talking about it and just start cutting me a check already?  I mean, by the time this actually goes forward, I'll be dead of old age and won't get any of the benefit.  I'd like to take advantage of this while I can still move about and enjoy the freedom afforded by not having to work.
Kinda the same reason I won't date a rabidly Christian/Vegan/Crossfit/Evangelical of any kind. I don't have the energy for their passion!
If you ever get that CETME L we're gonna need a full write up for science. 
>the amendment was created to arm militias \n\nThe militia is "all able bodied men who are able to come to the aid of the nation in a time of war."  Those men were required to *bring their own weapons with them* because the nation didn't own any.\n\nObviously, we live in a different world today, with standing armies and huge stockpiles of nationally owned weapons. But, the point here is that the 2nd Amendment was written to enforce the *right* of the people to keep weapons of war, because they might need them to fight a war.  Since they have the right to keep weapons of war, obviously they were trusted to do so.\n\nNow, they are not necessary to secure the safety of the nation, but the question remains "are the People to be trusted with weapons."  I say yes, most of the anti-gun people say no.  If we are not to be trusted with weapons, who can be trusted?  The government alone?  The government is made up of the people, and if we can't be trusted, neither can they.  \n\nAlready we are in a condition where I don't trust the police, because they use force where it is unnecessary and suffer no consequences for their actions. They largely ignore the laws they are there to enforce, and instead spend most of their time enforcing their own egos - and doing so with weapons they don't want to allow me to use.\n\nI know how to make weapons, and so I don't care if weapons become illegal to sell - I will always be able to possess them.  Ban whatever you want. When no one but the Police and the Criminals have weapons, and the criminals outnumber the police 10 to 1, things will get much more dangerous, not less.
Well, damn.  
I LOVE Dead Horse Point.  It's one of the most spectacular views I've ever seen.  I could live in Utah, without question.
Most power plants are steam engines already, regardless of what the heat source is.
So, bow and arrow should be illegal as well?  What about cars, that can be used to drive down a person without losing enough energy to stop, and thus carry on and mow down a dozen others in a crowd?  
I just recently moved to NN from the Atlanta area.  I'm renting in "the most expensive apartment complex in the area" but it's very close to where I work, and it's really nice.  It's up within half a mile of the Airport, so not right next to Langley, but is within a very short drive.\n\nMy wife and I play D&D at Atomic Comix on Denbigh, and there are other shops in the area that host games, so you should be fine.  I've got a co-worker who lives near by, and one who lives in Buckroe Beach, in a waterfront apartment, and is happy there.\n\nAll in all, there are a ton of decent places to live, temporarily or long term. If you want a great place to rent for a few months, and don't mind paying a little extra, check out my complex. It's a great place to live while looking.  I'm not planning to stay here long term, but until I find out house, I'm happy here.\n\nThis place is dog friendly, has a dog walk area on property and lots of people here have pets.  It has a nice pool with swim-up bar, nice gym area and the office hosts events several times a month.  You can walk to several fast food places (Jason's Deli, Five Guys, Firehouse Subs, Frosty Frog, etc) and grocery stores, Total wine, etc. from the apartment.\n\nPM me if you want details.
Read the law again.  It's against the law for the CDC to advocate for gun control.
>Now that **the GOP** can repeal all the anti-energy, anti-job regs—the Left offers to trade those regs for a carbon tax,” tweeted Norquist, president of the group Americans for Tax Reform. “Nice try. No.”\n\nSo, the party itself is making laws?  Interesting. I always thought that the party leadership called the shots.  Nice to see it confirmed.
Came here looking for comments referencing Kevin Bacon.  Was not disappointed.
I'm all for it!  Yea California!  (I live in Virginia)
This is a GOOD thing.  I love children, and we need to keep reproducing, but right now there are too many people.  If we could slowly taper off to about half (or a quarter) of our current population it would be a great thing.
Security theater is not what is keeping all the planes from being taken out by terrorists in the US.  If there were terrorists who wanted to create chaos in the US airline transportation system, they could simply bomb the lines waiting to get through the screening process.\n\nStatistically speaking, the number of terror attacks the TSA has stopped (when expressed as a percentage of flying public in the US) since 2001 is zero.  There's no reason to expect that the TSA is making flying in the US any more safe than wearing a "I'm bomb proof" sticker would.
I can do better than just the name of the apartments.  [Here's a link](http://radiusmaac-px.rtrk.com) to the website.\n\nHonestly, the airport noise is surprisingly low.  Yeah, we hear airplanes fly out every once in a while, between about 5:30 am and 10:00 at night or so.  But it's not bad at all.  The traffic on Jefferson is more noticeable, most of the time, and that's just normal traffic noise, with the occasional siren or whatever.\n\n
We used to contribute more dispite having a smaller percentage of the population.  Is moving in the right direction a problem for you?\n\nChina used to contribute much less despite having a HUGE percentage of the population, now they contribute more than anyone.  India's per capita percentage has doubled over the last few decades - but that's just fine because the US is still relatively high, right?\n\nSo, just hate us, because we're a successful industrialized nation.  Got it.  What have YOU done lately to change this?
I've spent years in Dahlonega.  Never saw a KKK meeting or march. Never attended a lynching.  Yeah, some of those things happened, but it doesn't mean everyone in Dahlonega or in Georgia is a racist.
I'm interested in this place too. Even WCA has had enough stupid shit to make me want to find somewhere else - I had a Linda carbine pointed right at my face just two weeks ago. 
Generally, the People who are " up in arms" over this are those who can't stand the idea that there is anyone, anywhere, that isn't in a panic over Climate Change. I mean, the people who don't care are not marching or yelling about their own apathy.\n\nSome are "up in arms" over the proposed change in legislation prompted by the claims of the Climate Change alarmists. Me, personally, I don't mind the changes proposed. I don't think they will do one damn thing to change the temperature, one way or the other, but that's because I am actually a little more informed about the issue, and I can do math. \n\nBut, hey, if people's want to feel good about themselves and think that passing these kinds of useless but feel-good measures will help, I'm fine with letting them go through. After all, making people feel good is a worthy goal, isn't it?
Don't forget that the "world's only superpower" only contributes 15% of the emissions, and in the US the amount of emissions we produce today are about the same as the emissions we produced in the 1990s, while the population has grown by about 30%.  \n\nIn the same timeframe, the developing nations have more than doubled their *per capita* emissions while also growing their populations more rapidly that we have.  Assuming that things progress in the same way they have been, we'll continue to reduce our *per capita* emissions while other nations continue to ignore their growth.  \n\nAll of the scary projections of Climate Change are predicated on growth of emissions, not steady state, or per capita declines, as the US is demonstrating.  But, hey, keep blaming the US for everything if it makes you feel better.  Hate us first, right?
Depends on the mortality rate. If it's more than 0.51 people who fail to reach a child-bearing age, then it's not growth.
Did I ever say "we have the right to continue to emit at higher rates than all other nations" or anything similar to that?  \n\nAlso, while I agree that "every nation has the right to industrialize," I will disagree that every nation has a right to do anything like increase their own emissions to dangerous levels, just because someone else is also emitting at dangerous levels.  \n\nThat's like saying, "well, since there are serial killers in the world who have killed over 30 people, everyone should have the right to kill 30 people."  If (and I'm not arguing this point either way) GHG emissions are dangerous and must be curtailed for the sake of the planet, it is irresponsible for any nation to increase their GHG emissions.  If we must reduce GHG emissions to zero (or as near to zero as we can manage) to prevent global disaster, then why is it okay to allow any nation to increase their emissions while others are required to reduce.\n\nIs it okay to allow murders to "catch up" to other murderers before they have to stop killing people?  Is it okay to allow companies who are manufacturing deadly chemical contaminants to *increase the number of children they kill* because some other company has been killing more children?\n\nEvery time I read "but other nations should be allowed to increase their industrialization and emissions, because they have to catch up with the US and Europe" I increase my belief that this whole thing is less about the climate or about temperature than it is about economic envy.  If it were truly about an existential threat to the environment, no one would ever be allowed to *increase the damage* they do to the environment.  We'd all be pushing as hard as we can to prevent any increase, no matter how small, in the damage we're doing.\n\nBut, no.  It's "the US must exchange places with developing nations as the most damaging polluter for a while, until they catch up."  Yep. That makes perfect sense.  We need to do whatever it is that we can to make certain that we're reducing our emissions, but developing nations such as China and South Africa, Brazil and India, should be allowed to grow without restraint until they rival the bad old US for 100 years, or until they crush us economically.  For the children.

>Batteries aren't "power" per-say, they only store energy created by another energy source be it wind / solar/ oil / gas / coal.\n\nTechnically speaking, fossil fuels aren't really an energy source either, they are just chemical storage for solar energy.  Wind is caused by the uneven distribution of solar energy on the surface of the earth, causing air in some areas to rise creating low pressure systems while allowing cooler, more dense air to fall in other areas, creating high pressure systems (oddly enough, high pressure systems are often warmer on the surface, due to the ideal gas law and the lapse rate, but that's besides the point).\n\nHydro-electric systems generally rely upon water that was evaporated by the sun, moved around by the wind, then deposited as precipitation on a higher elevation, then runs downhill to where it can be used to turn big turbines.\n\nSo, all energy, really, is solar energy or nuclear, with the vast majority of the energy that we actually use being various forms of solar.
Let me do some math for you.  At 3mm per year, 30 years would see a sea level rise of about three and a half inches.  A good bit of California is several thousand feet above sea level.  \n\nYou are off by, oh, a few thousand years, at least.
After 13 years of tent camping with the Scouts (as an adult leader), my wife and I are getting back into camping with a camper. We just bought a [Teardrop](http://golittleguy.com) camper and in the first month, we've taken it out 3 weekends (the 4th weekend was spent on a group motorcycle ride with the Indian Motorcycle's Rider's Group). Can't wait for this weekend coming up, we're going to [Shenandoah Valley](https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm) for a couple of days.\n\nTent camping is great, and we've spent hundreds of nights on the ground in a tent, but having a comfy bed and a kitchen along is very nice.
I'm currently driving a 2013 Leaf, after about 33,000 miles, still have 90 mile range in warm weather.  I have no idea what the value of the car will be in 8 years, but I assume it will have very little value left, if any.  For the next four or five years, however, you should get lots of good service from the vehicle.  And, honestly, if you consider how much you will save in gasoline, oil changes, and other gas-car related maintenance, it's worth doing.\n\nNo one can really tell what the future holds, and I'm not going to try to speculate.  For today, however, the Leaf is a good car to own.  In two years?  Maybe a Chevy Bolt will be the go-to car, or some other new electric.  Who knows?  
This list doesn't take a lot of things into question, such as race, religion, state where one lives, socio-economic status, etc.  An upper middle-class white man living in New York has more in common with an average Swede than he does with a black man in Mississippi, for example.  He'd be much less likely to have a criminal record or have ever been in jail, have higher educational attainment, lower birth-mortality, etc.\n\nContrast this with any nation on the Continent of Africa, for example, or anywhere in South or Central America.  With just under half of the US being either black or hispanic (or both), each with much higher percentage of the negative attributes on this list, and a MUCH smaller percentage of such people in Sweden, the comparison is just not apples to apples.
Really high compared to .357 mag. I feel like a 10MM Kriss Vector might be your jam. 
The problem here is that comparing the US (315 million people) with Canada (35 million) is like comparing, oh, New York with all of Europe.  Canada is not safe *because of it's gun laws*.  Look at how incredibly dangerous and murder filled Canada was before the crackdown on gun ownership.... that's right, it wasn't.  It never was an incredibly violent place.  People there are, in general, less violent.\n\nThe US is a very diverse nation, with areas that are incredibly safe (as safe as Canada) and areas that are decidedly NOT safe (as dangerous as Brazil or South Africa, perhaps).  \n\nLet's ignore guns for a moment, and focus on crimes committed by other means.  Are you saying that the existence of lax gun laws causes stabbings?  Or perhaps the lack of good gun laws causes more death by blunt force trauma?  Does the ability to own a firearm not intended for hunting greatly increase rape, even rape that is not committed at the point of a firearm?  Because all of these things are much more common in urban areas of the US than they are in Canada.\n\n\nIf so, why do you think that hunting rifles owned by hunters and no other guns allowed makes Canadians less likely to use a date rape drug, or just force one's self on a helpless victim?
This is the problem I have with all of these "unattended package delivery" systems.  Deliver in certain neighborhoods, and the packages will never arrive - and you'll lose robots, too.
It's hard to argue with that. The only thing to consider is if it's for use or for resale.  If it's for use, then it's worth the money.  I figure having the electric car saved me $110 per month over the last 3 years versus driving an equivalent gasoline vehicle. Add in oil changes, air filters, annual emissions tests, and the eventual replacement of the timing belt, catalytic converter, radiator, etc. and that adds to the figures by a good bit.  Enough so that over 6 years, the battery is completely covered by the extra costs I would have had to pay anyway.\n\nStill, if you're paying attention to resale value, the car is losing value fast, and the best thing to do is to drive it until it's no longer serviceable, and then just walk away from it.  Maybe you can get a high functioning used battery pack from a junk yard for a lot less?
The cop says that the citizen has no need, and no permission, to record the encounter because the police are already recording it.  I'm pretty sure that's not within the police authority to enforce, but fine.  Show me the police video, then.  And, when it shows the police are, indeed, showing a profound lack of respect for both the citizens and the law, the policemen should be fired.  If the police video turns up missing, that's destruction of evidence and the police who were in charge of preserving that evidence should be arrested for that crime.\n\nI'm tired of cops thinking they can swear at people, threaten physical violence, and make up laws in their own tiny heads to enforce.  Show some GODDAMN RESPECT, or get the fuck out of the job.
That's entirely my point.
Just out of curiosity, how many times a day do you have to fuel your gasoline car?  We plug our electric car in when we come home at night, and tomorrow it has a full charge.  It takes us literally zero minutes waiting for the car to "fill" with energy.  We plug in (3 seconds) and walk into the house.   Done.\n\nIf you drive 300 miles a day, you're driving, what? over 2000 miles per week?  Over 9000 miles per month? over 110,000 miles every year?  That's just nuts.   Let me do some math for you.  I'm going to assume that you don't own one of those pansy little eco-hybrid cars, do you?  You probably own a big-block muscle car or pick-up truck.  So, what? 20 miles per gallon?\n\nAt 9000 miles per month, you'd need 450 gallons of gasoline per month.  We'll figure you spend $2 per gallon.  That's $900 on gas per month.  It's also at least a couple of oil changes per month, a new air filter per month, etc., but I'm going to assume you do all of your own maintenance and it's magically cheap.\n\nSo, I get 4 miles per kilowatt-hour in my electric car.  If I drove 9000 miles per month, that would be 2250 kilowatt-hours of electricity, at $0.11 per kilowatt-hour.  My energy costs would be $247.50.  That's $652.50 per month cheaper than your "better range" car.  If, of course, I drove my electric car 300 miles per day.  I'd have to charge my car twice while I was "out" at about 30 minutes of charge time, each.\n\nSo, saving $650 per month, for five years...  That's $40,000 in savings, or about twice what I spent on my car.\n\nNow, of course, I don't drive nearly as much as you do, so I don't need a 300+ mile range.  I can drive over 180 miles in a day with minimal charging interruptions (one charge at 30 minutes, while I'm out), if I were driving a lot, or around 90 miles and never, ever stopping at a charging station, gas station, or anything, and just charging at home, while I'm doing other things.\n\nIf I were commuting, at 75 miles one way, and I had charging available at both ends, I would once again have zero time spent filling up my vehicle at a gas station.  Charge at home (zero time actually spent, because I plug in and then go in to do other things, like eat, watch TV, and sleep) and plug in at work, and let the car charge while I'm earning money at work.\n\nBut, I'm sure you can't do those things.  I'm special. Right?  Oh, wait...   The national average is under 13,000 miles driving per year.  That's only about 30 miles per day.  That means that a 60 mile drive is twice a normal days' drive, and 90 miles is three times a normal day's excursion.\n\nRight now, today, you can go out and buy a car with a 124 mile range, which would cover a normal person for nearly a week's worth of driving.  Soon, cars (later this year, with the 2018 models) with 250 mile ranges will be available.  They are not as cheap as the cheapest cars on the market, but they will be cheaper to own after fuel and maintenance costs are figured in over the life of the vehicle.  Break even costs with gasoline cars will be in the 3 year time-frame, I'm guessing.
> As an industrialized nation living on the same earth as the others, we have an obligation both to ourselves and one another to use this industrialized economy to invent ways for developing countries to bootstrap themselves to full industrialization\n\nWait, we have the **obligation** to invent ways for other nations to industrialize without doing it the way we did?  Why didn't some other nation have the obligation to invent ways for us to do it better than we did?  Why do we have the obligation to fix things for other nations?\n\nI fully get that we should be working together to make things better for everyone, and we should take the best ideas no matter where they come from and try to implement them, but why is it OUR job to come up with all of the ideas?  I reject that view.  It's not our obligation to always be the inventors.  We we don't do it, it can't be done?  Bullshit.\n\nThe history of mankind includes advances from all over - Asians had civilization for thousands of years.  We did not demand that they invent a way out of the Dark Ages, and you don't get to demand that we invent the way out of the Industrial age.\n\n>You can claim someone is insulting your country when they attack the exploititave economic system it utilizes, but then you'd be missing the point in order to act proud and patriotic.\n\nWhatever.  An economic system is judged on the quality of life it affords the people who live under it.  I'll accept any economic system that gives a better quality of life than the one I'm living under today.  Let me know when the northern European model abandons capitalism and money all together, and I'll encourage the US to do so as well, if it becomes clear that buying and selling things is worse than some other system.\n\nOr, in reality, I'll be dead long before that becomes a reality anywhere.  Until then, a Capitalist society with socialist styled safety net for those who can't (or won't) contribute through work and taxation seems to be the best system we've come up with yet.
Look at how much crime is "smash and grab" burglary of unattended property versus armed robbery of actual people.  But, sure, you might be right.  There might be zero uptick in theft from delivery robots.
>Please, go ahead and tell me I'm some kind of bleeding heart with no grasp of the practicalities at hand and that there is no practical benefit for us Americans to a have other countries go green.\n\nYou're still accusing me of things that you have no evidence for. I never said that it is no benefit for us Americans to have other countries go green.  Show me where I said that or take it back. Strawman attacks are so common, and effective against people who will not read, but I'm tired of trying to defend against things I never did or said.\n\nI said that we do not have an obligation to develop other nations, or to invent ways for them to develop.  I also said that it is in our best interest to help them.  What more do you want?\n\nAgain, we in the developed nations are currently reducing our per capita GHG emissions.  We're leading the world in reduction of pollutants, and increasing our economic gain while reducing our impact on pretty much everything.  We're moving in the right direction, and we are sharing our technological advances with anyone who will listen to us.  \n\nSo, how again is that "not understanding the benefits of long-term strategy?"  If you just want to say, "the US is bad, because I enjoy hating the US" go ahead and say that.  Otherwise, give me some sort of rational of what it is that you think we're doing wrong, here. Or, even tell me what you in your superior wisdom thing we should be doing that we are not.  I might even agree with you.  Instead, you seem to be stuck on thinking that I'm blind to any thought of the future, without any reason to believe it except that you want to think it's true.
Okay, so you want to talk about how we're producing 16 metric tons per capita, while China only produces 7.6.  But, you are more than willing to ignore the fact that we used to produce 20 metric tons per capita, at a time when China produced 3.  We've reduced our per capita by 20%, while they've more than doubled theirs.\n\nFor me, it's not about pure numbers per person, but about where the journey is leading.  We're reducing our per capita numbers while increasing our efficiency. That's the right direction, isn't it?  We get no credit for that?
That's 180 degrees away from what you said the first time.  You said that we hand an OBLIGATION to help developing nations grow without repeating our mistakes.  We do not.\n\nIt may very well be in our own best interests to learn how to progress into the future with more sustainable energy policies, but that's not even close to what you suggested the first time.\n\n>The fact that you haven't considered the long-term effects\n\nYou are stating as a fact something you have no way of demonstrating. I have, in fact, considered the long term effects of our current methods or production (you call it "industrialization" but that's a misnomer.)  \n\nWe industrialized using massive coal powered steam engines that directly powered factories and foundries.  It seems that we have already "invented" newer and more efficient ways "to industrialize," and shared those newer ways with developing nations.  Stop being so preachy and assuming that everyone besides you is ignorant and has never had a thought in their head.  Odds are I thought about those things before you were born (although, this being the Internet, you could actually be my senior, I don't really know.)  But, since I was thinking about new technologies and new ways of making things back in the early 1970s, I'm going to guess that I am correct.\n\nI also spent a lot of time thinking about the old ways of living, before industrialization, and how we in the modern world should embrace some of those older, more sustainable ways of living, too. The pre-industrial people did not live horrible lives at all times - being able to run to Walmart to buy a new toaster oven is not the epitome of a perfect society.  They had light at night, warmth on a cold winter day, art and music.  We have refrigeration, better medicine, and the ability to do more work than can be done by animal muscles alone.  Add in electronics and modern communication and we have great advances, but at heart we are not all that much different from ancient man.\n\nThe big problem is that we can't stop growing and can't seem to stop being wasteful. But, hey, you seem to have the solutions for everything. I'll just sit back and let you run the world for a while, and I'm sure everything will turn out perfectly. I won't even try to run it, since I'm so ignorant.
that would be very wrong.  Calling for the destruction of someone else's property because of a sign that was put up is wrong. What if the owner wants vandals to burn the place down, so he (or she) can collect on the insurance, raising rates for everyone else?  You don't have enough information to make a call for something that can't be undone.
Damn it!  I just moved to the coast, too.  I drove to the beach yesterday - fortunately it was still there.  I'll check back this evening, to see if it disappeared overnight.  The local hotel even allowed me to book a room in advance, the crooks!\n\nHey, I have a campground site pre-booked for August, this year.  Should I trust that the east coast will still be there by then?  
You know, I'm thinking that one might be able to make a lot of money in the near future by adding a "sound circuit" to electric cars so that *inside the car* one hears and feels the sound of a big-block engine.  I've been on rides in Disney where you'd swear you are in a real rocket or fighter jet, because the speaker system rumbles your seat and fills your ears with that sound.  A decent sub-woofer and speaker system would solve that sound problem for you.
I work only for money; but I don't live to work.  I work for enough money to live well enough to do the things that make me happy, like spending time with my wife and kids.
And Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize.  Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
I do not. But, I'm happy you have somewhere to live where you feel safe.  I lived most of my life in an area where everyone I knew had guns, and I felt safe there.  Now I live where only cops and criminals have guns, and there are shootings every couple of days.  Last week, someone was shot right outside of my office building. The person doing the shooting carried the gun illegally, as do 90% of the people doing the shooting in any of the areas that are high in crime.\n\nSo, go ahead and make it illegal to carry long, black, scary looking rifles.  Enjoy your illusion of safety that brings, while criminals still do 95% of their crime with easily concealed pistols.  
I find it very interesting that I see this post just after I wrote up a bit for my son, who's game I am the DM for (both my boys, and a few of their friends, actually).  Anyway, he "found" old writings of his grandfather (who is now missing, presumed dead) in a basement.  As he was reading those documents, he was transported to a world where magic exists, but he arrived naked and without any gear.  After bumbling along as a 1st level Warlock, he just leveled up, and I'm giving him his Book of Shadows, which is written for him by his Grandfather.\n\nThe Patron is Yig, the ancient Great Old One who is the parent (father or mother, whichever you want to believe) of all Serpents.  This Great Old One was documented by the Lovecraftian Mythos, but also exists in other pantheons, under different names.  Ancient and inscrutable, Yig is so alien to our way of thinking that direct contact would drive most men insane, so she (or he) communicates with people via hints and notes left behind by older, more established worshipers.\n\nEven Tiamat will have to acknowledge Yig as an ancestor, and a high level Warlock of Yig will have significant advantages and abilities.  This could be fun.
>I have no clue what "Pog-town" is.\n\nPoquoson, probably.
> I work by a precinct and have heard the phrase "I can't breath" or "I'm hurting" probably over 1000 times in the past few years. \n\nI wonder if part of the reason you hear this is because cops regularly cause people pain.  Oh, sure, part of it is acting, but....\n\nCops enjoy inflicting pain.  They use pain to "gain compliance" all the time.  Don't want to move quickly enough when a cop issues you an order?  Get moved, and have pain delivered along with it.  Is every word that issues from the mouth of a cop a "legal order?" Hell no. But, cops seem to thing that if they say it, non-cops have to obey, and if they don't the cop is justified in causing pain to enforce their will.\n\nThe best response to being asked anything by a cop is to keep silent. The best response to being physically detained is to not resist.  I won't help a cop against my own best interests.  Since anything I ever say to a cop "can be used against me" and any action I take can be twisted around by a prosecutor to try to convict me, my best course of action is to take none.  I want cops to remember that whenever they want me to help them do anything. 
The term "assault rifle" is very carefully defined, as is "assault weapon."  They mean two different things.  An assault rifle is highly regulated, and no one can legally buy an assault rifle manufactured after the year 1986, and the ones that are legally in private hands are never, *ever* used to commit crimes.\n\n
The barrel is so damned long as it is. I want to SBR it but that takes time and a new receiver, so I probably won't...
Most of the discussions here are about big business - huge corporations run by the top 1% of wealthy individuals, or the managers of huge investment funds.  We, the little people, have virtually zero say in what happens, how this is managed, or how emissions rise or fall.\n\nYes, we can decide to buy LED lightbulbs, but the electricity for those bulbs is generated in massive electric power plants - and the consumers have very little choice of how those plants generate electricity.  [The generation of electricity is responsible for over 40% of the CO2 emissions in the US.  Industrial (non-power related) emissions account for about 20% and Agriculture accounts for about 17%, nationally](http://whatsyourimpact.org/greenhouse-gases/carbon-dioxide-emissions).  I'd be willing to bet that California emits a bit higher emissions for Industry and Agriculture than many states.\n\nYes, the transportation sector is a large part of the equation, and personal vehicles are a big part of transportation, but so is Shipping (Port of Los Angeles, anyone?) and moving cargo via trucks and trains.  California has a HUGE interest in how much fossil fuel is used to move cargo around, both within the state, and through the state from other nations into the rest of the US.\n\nThere are more issues here than what individuals can accomplish, and if it were cheaper to do things another way, the huge companies would already be doing things another way.  What the discussion is all about is how can we force companies to use more expensive methods to generate electricity, to move freight from one place to another, and to grow and process foods.\n\nFor companies, there are only two options when costs go up: make lower profits or raise consumer prices.  Good economics understanding shows that raising prices, all other things being equal, reduces demand.  People will spend the same amount of money, just buy less with it.  \n\nAt the end of the day, higher costs means a lower overall quality of life, as the same things just cost more.  As the costs in California continue to go up, it becomes more attractive to do business elsewhere.  Yes, I know it's not a all or nothing decision, and I know that raising incomes for the poorest among us has not resulted in massive business losses.\n\nIt's a balance.  So, assume that California does decide to continue to push for zero (or very low) emissions from the state.  How do we move the cargo, make things (industrial emissions) and grow food with very little emissions?  Will "cap and trade" or "carbon taxes" solve this puzzle?  Or will it just move money around?
What keeps people from stealing the packages it's delivering?
Yes, I agree. That's why my wife was a "stay-at-home" mom for 19 years, and I chose to stay in a job that I could work when I wanted, for the most part, rather than a more lucrative management position where the demands of the job come first.\n\nNow I am pairing my life and my needs down as much as I can in preparation for giving up working at all. I can live on a lot less than I am making now, if I just do a few if the right things, and am willing to give some things up. I figure that I have less than five years of work left that I have to do. I will like continue to do some work for another ten, to make the transition easier.
You know what keeps a ship flying?  Love.  
It sure seems like the current politicians (not just the US based ones) are pushing us that way.
Or even 1 billion.  Of course, I'd be fine with four or five billion, I guess.  Even ten billion would be okay, if we weren't so poorly distributed and we could learn how to live without so much pollution and habitat destruction.  But, we're pretty stupid, as a species, and I think fewer people is better for the time being.\n\nNot that I think we should go about killing anyone, or even requiring population controls like China had for a while.  Industrialized societies tend to be more educated, and more educated societies tend to know more about the economic consequences of having lots of kids, and know how to prevent pregnancies.  So, education is the answer.
Oh, I don't want to bring her into this at all.  Just adding conversation.
The limitation will soon become the delivery of the electricity, not the ability of the batteries to absorb the power.  As it is today, the batteries can drain a lot faster than the power is delivered, generally speaking.\n\nI charge my car with a Level 2 EVSE, which delivers 6.6 kilowatts of power to the car.  That's based on 30 amps at 220 volts.  A high powered DC charger can deliver energy at a good bit higher rate, and the batteries don't care.  I think the DC charger is 480 volts DC.  Enough to charge my car from dead to 80% (19.2 kWh) in half an hour.  \n\nElon Musk as proposed an upgrade to the Supercharger network that would allow for a lot more power delivery, and Nissan/BMW/FIAT and others that are competing with him are doing likewise for their networks.  We'll soon see something like a quadrupling of the power delivery available on rapid chargers - with existing battery packs.\n\nIf this happens, we'd be able to add, oh, 300 miles of range in half an hour, or 100 miles of range in a quick 10 minute charge.  That's about the right amount of time for a bathroom break, or to buy a soda.  The longer charge time is less time thank one would normally take for a lunch or dinner break.\n\nWe don't need the improved batteries for this at all.  We just need improved charging infrastructure.
>It's my only car\n\nThis might be the #1 problem.  I have a Leaf (a 2013 model, all 12 bars remaining, with a bit over half the miles you have on yours), and I LOVE it.  The thing is, this is a great car for running around town, in and out and back within a few miles.  It's 90% of the driving my wife and I do, and so this car gets used 90% of the time.\n\nOn the other hand, we do like to take our long trips on the weekends. We have a small camper, and a motorcycle (and utility trailer).  We used to live in a house and have a boat, and such as well. So, we needed a larger gasoline vehicle that could pull trailers, drive long distances and such.  Having one of each is the perfect solution.\n\nHave you considered cheap weekend rentals at Hertz or Enterprise or something?  They generally give good discounts on the weekends, have frequent user discounts, club memberships and such.  Then, when you want to go long distances on the weekend, you can rent a newer gasoline car and just go.
BLM is a large, disorganized movement.  The KKK is a specific organization.  There are people who are supporters of BLM who are using "free speech" to call for the beating, killing of *white people*.  Those people are just as bad.  There are others who are supporters of BLM who just want to be treated with respect by the police and other authority figures.  \n\nThose who paint entire segments of society, whole races, or everyone in a national movement with the same brush are generally wrong to do so.  There are some exceptions to this rule, as with most generalities.
So, "one of those" is all that should be allowed?  Maybe there's room for one more?
I bought a Tanfoglio Witness Hunter in 10mm. How do I get rid of this erection?\n\nSpez: Also, I want the scope mount but I was told by EAA's CS that they only import those in Silver. What's the best way to blue that to match? 
I don't *need* to own a television.  I don't actually *need* a sofa.  I certainly don't need to own a car, or a pair of boots, or a bicycle.  I've never *required* the use of a musical instrument.  And yet, all of these things are legal to own, just because someone might actually want to own them.\n\nWe don't make laws based on whether someone needs something or not, we make laws based on harm done to another person; or at least we used to. Well, to be honest, as soon as some busybodies decided they could group together and make laws banning items or practices they personally didn't like, they did so.\n\nWe are a stupid group of people, really, using the force of large numbers to try to enforce our will, and our prejudices, on those who are not like us.  Those who fear motorcycles, who think that people should not ride them because they are too dangerous, would make it illegal to own a motorcycle if they could get enough support. As it is, these same people want to make it more of a pain in the ass to ride than it should be.\n\nSelf-apointed do-gooders want to make "dangerous items" like 4 inch knives and switchblades illegal, because someone might use those items to cause harm to someone else.  Just because that very same someone can pick up a piece of rebar and do the same amount of damage never occurs to them.  Same thing with guns.  Yes, a gun can cause harm, and no, most people never have a need for one.  But, that should not mean that no one should be allowed to possess one.\n\nI've owned guns for over 40 years, and have never managed to bring myself to use one to cause another human harm.  Not once.  I don't even go shooting very often.  I also own several knives, and have yet to run through a crowd stabbing people.  Why even own knives, then, am I right?\n\nI have shot my firearms at paper targets, and a few times at animals I intended to eat.  Not because I had to: the grocery stores are full of animals killed on factory farms that I could eat.  But, hey, I decided at some point that I wanted to know if I could get my own food if I had to do it.  Turns out, I can.  Since I proved it to myself, I've lost interest.\n\nWhen I was younger, I kept a gun for "protection."  Then, as I got older, I realized that I was much better protected by simply avoiding areas where dangerous people spent their time.  Now, I don't go to areas where I am likely to need a gun for protection, and so I don't carry one.  I still own them, of course, for other reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, I do know several people who have successfully used their firearms to fend off those who would have done them harm. So, it is still a good idea to have self-defense weapons legal and available to the public.\n\nDo you think that Hillary Clinton has no need of anyone in her employ being armed?  
This is exactly the relationship a couple of friends of mine had (well, they actually got married, and had three kids together).  It worked for a while, but she eventually wanted out of the marriage and used the sex with others as a way to cause him emotional harm.  Eventually, they divorced, and it became very bitter.\n\nThis kind of thing *can* work, but usually doesn't, not for the long term.  It's fun while it lasts, though.
The propaganda is working, then?
Why did Rosa Parks *need* to sit in the front of the bus?
This is because it is not true.
The difference from petty larceny and armed robbery. So, apparently nothing.

How often do you drive "back home?"  Every day?  Once a week?  Twice a month?\n\n>yes, just driving around on a normal day I don't drive that many miles\n\nThat was my point.\n\n>but if I ever want to go long distance it just isn't practical in an electric vehicle.\n\nIf you ever want?  Hell, if I ever want to drive around the planet, I can't do it on one tank of gas, either.  If you base your decisions on "if I ever want to do something," you'd buy things that don't make sense for your normal life. \n\nLet me ask you this: are you single?  Do you plan to be single for the rest of your life? Do you plan on owning only one vehicle at a time for the rest of your life?  Have you ever rented a car?\n\nI'll be the first to admit that owning an electric car isn't the ideal situation for everyone. Maybe it's not right for you today, and maybe it won't be right for you ever. But, if you drive more than 150 miles one way less than a couple of times a month, and drive under 90 miles a day the rest of the time, I'd bet an electric car would meet your needs perfectly. \n\nIf you really are making 200 mile, each way trip three or four times a month, then wow. That's dedication.  The new Chevy Bolt will have a 235 mile one-way range.  That means that you could easily drive this huge trip every single day, if you so desired, and once a week would be no problem.\n\nI know you say that it's just not practical in an electric car. It wasn't last year, unless you bought a Tesla.  It will be next year.  That's without even bothering to talk about having a charger along the way, and stopping for any amount of time to charge.  If I had a 124 mile range Leaf, and a 180 mile drive, I could stop ONCE along the way to stretch my legs and take a piss (which I would do anyway during a more than 3 hour trip), and make the trip with ease.\n\nMay I ask what cities you are traveling from and to?
Apparently, the police force is self-selecting of people who are predisposed to this kind of cruelty.  Only those who want this kind of unchecked power and authority apply.
Right now, energy from renewable sources is more expensive.  Also, there is a political battle, where the Left has embraced renewable energy, so the political Right opposes it.  Not because renewable energy is wrong, but just simply be cause the Conservatives must oppose anything that the Progressives endorse.  If the Liberals say Blue, the Conservatives have to say Red.  They can't agree, for fear of being accused of being a traitor.
The enforcement agents don't make policy. The lawmakers and the President do. If we want this changed, and we do, we should petition our lawmakers to have it changed.
Has already happened to people in several states in the US, and in similar nations like the UK, Australia, Canada, etc.  You are simply wrong.
What about the P232? 
I hear that. This is all reasons why when I can make it, I'll go to shoot pistols at Renton Fish and Game, but most of the time I'm at WCA in Bellevue. Also, I reload literally *everything* I shoot except for .22lr and steel case. It's the only way to 10mm. 
I had all four out on the same day (3 impacted) with local only and it was only mild discomfort for about two weeks, and lots of ramen. It was a little scary at first and I think I broke a stress ball but it wasn't so bad in the end. 
I don't think "drug war and poverty stricken South American countries are a better comparison to the US," I think "drug war and poverty stricken South American countries are a better comparison" to many urban neighborhoods.  Some areas of the US are very well comparable to Canada, or Sweden, or the Netherlands, or whatever.  Other areas are more like Nicaragua or Columbia.\n\nLook, I have friends from Columbia.  It's a great place, with wonderful people, spectacular scenery and good food and music.  It also has poverty and crime.  Are you telling me that Canada is all just as crime ridden as Baltimore, Maryland, or Ferguson, Missouri?  \n\nWhere I lived previously, in the foothills of North Georgia, was probably a lot like Canada as far as crime goes.  We had very little violent crime, and I never even bothered to lock the doors to my house or car.  I lived there for 21 years and never locked my tool shed or my garage, and didn't have a dead-bolt lock on any door in the house.  The dog was able to open the back door anytime she wanted, just by pushing on it.\n\nBut, where I live now we have had something like 65 shootings *this year*, with a decent percentage of them being fatal.  We've had stabbings, rapes, robberies, burglaries - and this isn't considered a high crime area.  So, is the area where I'm living now more like Canada, or somewhere else?
> You people hear a couple stories and suddenly cops are evil. \n\nYou hear a couple of stories of bears eating people and all of a sudden all bears are dangerous animals.  You hear a couple of stories of snakes killing people and all of a sudden all snakes are evil.  You hear a couple of stories of Nazi death camps and all of a sudden all Nazis are evil.\n\nLook, the fact is that the police have the responsibility to root out anyone within their own ranks who abuses power.  Instead, they close ranks and refuse to testify against each other. They lie, hide evidence, and protect those they know to be dangerous and who have committed crimes.\n\nEvery cops I've ever met has abused his authority, just because he can.  Doesn't mean that he's harmed people, but I can damn well bet that every cop out there has threatened harm to innocent people, just because he has a gun and a badge.  Yes, there are cops out there who think they are "just doing their jobs" when they do this.  NAZI death camp guards were "just doing their jobs" as well.\n\nWhen the police massively thin out their ranks of the abusive, when they hold each other accountable on a more stringent basis than they hold the general public accountable, when they keep to traffic laws (unless they are actively responding to an emergency, with the emergency lights running, etc. as the law DEMANDS) then I will change my opinion.\n\nUntil then, I will treat every cop I see, in uniform or out, as if he's a dangerous wild animal that might decide to commit an illegal act of violence at any moment, and is watching me ONLY to see if he can get the chance to do me harm in some way.  Every encounter with a cop is a risk - there are no good encounters.
Or Starcraft...
Only thing that breaks thief skills is armor. (Except for backstab, but if you're using ranged weapons, you're not backstabbing anyway)

I'm notoriously bad at getting myself to a UPS or USPS. Maybe after the holidays?
Very soon here they will be hiring seasonal driver's helpers. They hire a *lot* of people to help out over the winter delivery season and it's a good chance to impress some drivers, and can leverage you into a job. 
And Tanfoglio, and Dan Wesson, and RIA...
If you're definitely leaving for college in January, check in with temp agencies or UPS/Fedex. UPS/Fedex is hiring for the holiday season only and they pay is traditionally pretty fair for the package runners. 
The 17L also has the lightened trigger. 
Same here. Stupid M1. :(
I got denied (mistaken identity), and then I got a UPIN when I got my appeal back. 
I want to fly home to see my folks!
Something is really up with those. Definitely overpressure signs but that's right in the zone for 9mm in pistols. I shoot right in that wheelhouse (4.0 gr titegroup, cci 500's) in my 16" 9mm Vector and I don't have any pressure signs.
There's an SBR'd one on waguns.org for sale right now. 
Seconded. 
That is precisely why I reload. 
You don't even get to talk to a realtor outside of Seattle for $54k. 
.22lr works great but wouldn't .410 be better? 
I thought it was Diana? They are all very nice in that shop. 
Not ridiculous. Unreasonably versatile. You now can use rat shot. 
Ugh, I hate you. 
Oh, the staff was there about .5 seconds after I started telling the guy to please only uncase at the line - it's just that things like this happen almost every time I shoot in Bay 1, and I feel like it happens way too often in Bay 2. Either it's people uncasing in the wrong place or overly large groups of shooters doing things that make me feel unsafe. I try to keep my ears on and eyes forward and stay in my booth but it's still stressful. 
There'll be me +1. We have some cool shit. Coonan .357 mag, couple M1 carbines, Kriss Vector CRB 9mm, and he's got some interesting others. I'll be bringing as much ammo as I can carry in. 
Typically these will sell used for about $525 with a sell-it-right-now price of $450. 
Eh. Work is work, I've never turned my nose up when I didn't have a job. It's over in just a month, and he can go back to sending applications afterwards, but in the meantime he can make some (not a lot, but some, ~$15/hour) and stem the bleeding. He can also quit at will if other work comes up. I don't see the downside. *PLUS he was interested in the position further up the chain. 
I have my Glock 17L on consignment at a local shop and when it sells I have two things that I can do with the money - my friend is selling his 6" GP100 and I told him if he can't sell it, I'll buy it at $500. If he sells it for his ask price I'll buy a Witness Hunter for sure. 
I would consider working on your 25 yard shots a lot more and also playing around with ammunition to find something that your gun likes the most. 
I just want him to get as much as he can out of it. He offered it to me at $500 and I told him to try and get more for it than that but I'll definitely take it off his hands for that price. 
You buy Ruger, don't you?
Goddamn that's a lot of money on a .22lr. 
How has that HK93 not sold yet? WTF. 
lolwut
I'm sorry to hear your lien expired. That's the thing with those, you use them to buy time but they do make it so you need to shit or get off the pot...\n\nGreat job getting paid though!
I'm tempted in that HK93 but I'm also in sell mode on my collection... GLWS
If you really don't want to bother with the small stuff there are shops that will sell on consignment. XT Armory in Renton only charges 10% for their time.
Oh, I fully get it. The OP isn't about to go under and doesn't need the money right NOW. However, the endgame for liens goes three ways - the lien expires at statutory periods (in which case our friend gets nothing), the lien gets paid and released, or the lien is taken to foreclosure. \n\nHe should take this guy to foreclosure, since he'll likely - again, this varies by state - be paid back on his legal fees for enforcing the lien and foreclosure as well. \n\nThe sad part is, if the homeowner is smart enough, in many states, he can pay off the lien at the county office for the original lien amount (and our friend gets nothing above his original lien) + the lien filing fees. The county then sends our friend the lien balance and this all goes away for the homeowner. It can get fairly complex, and it varies from state to state (often wildly) so he should talk to his lawyer. \n\nSource: I'm in construction credit. Pay your bills, folks. 
I met you back during your time at Cornell, and I think you're still awesome. How do you decide if a particular work of yours is worth showing off, or is everything you do just that good?
That's strange. The one I owned for about 2 years felt *exactly* like the 34's I've shot. 
The black plastic ones? If you're in WA we can do a hand off. 
I like to remind my co-worker of the time. I know it drives her insane. 
And that's all I ask for, really. A bit of gravitas behind the smiles, and a bit more recognition that these aren't toys.
My +1 is bailing on me. Anyone want to pick me up in Renton? I can help with gas dollas
I've got the same issue but I bought these on GoG and Beamdog won't help me out. 
They are light, handy, and fast compared to the Garand, and in semi-auto, more controllable than a Thompson IMO. I really like mine. 
Look for the CZ527FS. Hrrrrnnnggg. 
It was part of the fun for me... I hand drew a map like it was 1991 again. 
Sounds to me like you should consider a decent safe if you've got a 9yo. The 43 has a lower capacity than the 26 but the 43 is much smaller. \n\nI've shot the M+P Shield and it's also very controllable, and generally very cheap. 
When I was in the area, state land really was the only way to go. I'm a minority too and the fudds were really weird about my wanting to get into the shooting sports. 
Not only that but the range does cease-fire at 8:45, so there's plenty of time to get your shooting in. 
Gun shows in the area lately have sucked. You can check Pinto's in Renton (you can see their inventory weekly online) as they get a lot of older milsurp. 
I don't - I left Ithaca and NY about 7 years ago and haven't been back. \n\nGood choice on CZ - I love my CZ527FS in .223. 
I've got over 1500 loaded... for the Coonan!
He and I talked about east coast food on the regular. I do miss him too.
Tip# 1: take a safety course or get a familiarization from someone you trust. \n\nTip#2: Buy lots of ammo and practice, practice, practice. 
UpAmmo is good people, buy from him!
It's easier to find a job when you have a job. Keep hunting. 
So you have a mechanic's lien on his house, right?\n\nDepending on the state, you can push for foreclosure on his home to be made whole out of the sale. Call your lawyer and find out. FINISH HIIIIIM
Whooooooooo booooy. 
I shoot at WCA Bellevue. 
What's the location like? I've never been there and am only now seeing that's not terribly far away. 
Sounds like you need a bank, man. 
I bought a Tanfoglio Witness Hunter. Bought the EAA scope rail for it. Mounted said scope rail, shot it a bit, took it off. Discovered that the scope rail ATE THROUGH THE F'N BLUING ON THE GUN.\n\nIf I weren't dead inside I'd be so mad I would cry. 
Completely fair. However, I understand from people who own PS90's, that once you go SBR you never want to look at the abomination known as 16" again. 
I just installed it on Win10 about two weeks ago and it ran right out of the box after standard patches and kicking compatibility mode to XP. 
I work 50-hours a week currently and have for the last two years. What I wouldn't give to go back to a 4-10 schedule. 
I just use gun oil. 
Enjoy and if you get two of them in all black you can be just like Trinity http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/5/5b/MatrixBeretta84F-1.jpg/600px-MatrixBeretta84F-1.jpg
Yeah. Definitely. I was delayed a bunch after I moved to the West Coast and got a hard deny. Sent in fingerprints, UPIN paperwork, and appeal paperwork and got an answer back about two months later, with the UPIN. All nice and easy. 
You can pretty easily load your own subsonic 9mm ammo in 147 gr. 
That's weird. The only times I've had issues with mine feeding was with cartridges that were too long and cartridges that weren't hot enough. Source: shoots 100 rounds of .357 mag/week in his Coonan
If he does this then they're his. 
Here you go bb http://www.gunbroker.com/item/588028282
lolwut
I has. Is worthy. 
Almost everyone working for UPS starts out working in their warehouses or in a delivery truck. He's also looking for work kind of right the hell now and it's a great way to impress the drivers and warehouse management. 
do want
I've been hunting for a Witness Hunter...in 10mm. Uuuuuuugh!

If you have already placed an order like I did, you can call and cancel and resubmit to get the lower price. 
I 'member being shamed into breaking up with my girlfriend because I was falling out of the church and she was still firm in Christ and I shouldn't drag her down with me, and having people rat us out to her parents.
I woke straight up in fight-or-flight mode. Thought it was the russians. 
For that price, buy a 10/22. 
Super strange. I found my best experiences were with 158gr Xtremes over 16.1gr IMR4227, CCI 550's. I don't think I've ever even used factory ammo in mine. 
Goddamn it. Bought it from him now anyway. Thanks man. You're the worst. 
Darn tootin'. 
Well, you've got to have the buffer tube. And it looks like the telescoping stock doesn't actually contact the buffer tube. 
None at the moment. It's the 16" barrel with a faux, pinned can.
